We propose a dynamic, leader-follower Stackelberg game to model this\ninteraction, where utility functions explicitly account for human fatigue and\ntrust. Through agent-based simulations, we demonstrate that while a naive model\nleads to a \"trust death spiral,\" a refined trust model creates a \"trust synergy\ncycle,\" increasing productivity by nearly 100 percent. Finally, we show that a\ncobot equipped with a proactive Trust-Repair Protocol can overcome system\nbrittleness, reducing trust recovery time after a severe failure by over 75\npercent compared to a non-adaptive model.

Recent advancements have seen the extensive application of\nreasoning-based multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in medical imaging to\nenhance diagnostic efficiency and interpretability. However, existing\nmultimodal models predominantly rely on \"one-time\" diagnostic approaches,\nlacking verifiable supervision of the reasoning process.

To address these issues, we propose\nCX-Mind, the first generative model to achieve interleaved \"think-answer\"\nreasoning for CXR tasks, driven by curriculum-based reinforcement learning and\nverifiable process rewards (CuRL-VPR). Specifically, we constructed an\ninstruction-tuning dataset, CX-Set, comprising 708,473 images and 2,619,148\nsamples, and generated 42,828 high-quality interleaved reasoning data points\nsupervised by clinical reports.

Distributionally robust RL addresses this issue by\noptimizing worst-case performance over an uncertainty set of environments and\nproviding an optimized lower bound on deployment performance. However, existing\nstudies typically assume access to either a generative model or offline\ndatasets with broad coverage of the deployment environment -- assumptions that\nlimit their practicality in unknown environments without prior knowledge.

We focus on general $f$-divergence-based uncertainty sets,\nincluding Chi-Square and KL divergence balls, and propose a computationally\nefficient algorithm with sublinear regret guarantees under minimal assumptions.\nFurthermore, we establish a minimax lower bound on regret of online learning,\ndemonstrating the near-optimality of our approach.

While some recent works have explored Differential Privacy (DP) to\nmitigate these privacy risks, DP-based training is known to cause significant\nperformance degradation and impose several limitations on standard training\nprocedures, making its direct application to downstream tasks both difficult\nand costly. In this work, we aim to address the above challenges within the\ncontext of document image classification by substituting real private data with\na synthetic counterpart. In particular, we propose to use conditional latent\ndiffusion models (LDMs) in combination with differential privacy (DP) to\ngenerate class-specific synthetic document images under strict privacy\nconstraints, which can then be utilized to train a downstream classifier\nfollowing standard training procedures.

Traditional numerical solvers offer high accuracy, but suffer from\nscalability issues and substantial computational costs. Pure data-driven deep\nlearning approaches, while efficient, lack physical constraints embedding\nduring training and require extensive labeled data, limiting their\napplicability and generalization. To overcome these limitations, we propose a\nU-shaped Physics-Informed Network (U-PINet), the first fully\ndeep-learning-based, physics-informed hierarchical framework for computational\nEM designed to ensure physical consistency while maximizing computational\nefficiency. Motivated by the hierarchical decomposition strategy in EM solvers\nand the inherent sparsity of local EM coupling, the U-PINet models the\ndecomposition and coupling of near- and far-field interactions through a\nmultiscale processing neural network architecture, while employing a\nphysics-inspired sparse graph representation to efficiently model both self-\nand mutual- coupling among mesh elements of complex $3$-Dimensional (3D)\nobjects. This principled approach enables end-to-end multiscale EM scattering\nmodeling with improved efficiency, generalization, and physical consistency.\nExperimental results showcase that the U-PINet accurately predicts surface\ncurrent distributions, achieving close agreement with traditional solver, while\nsignificantly reducing computational time and outperforming conventional deep\nlearning baselines in both accuracy and robustness.

However, LLMs still face challenges in spatial\nconsistency, multi-hop reasoning, and geographic bias. To address these issues,\nwe propose GeoSR, a self-refining agentic reasoning framework that embeds core\ngeographic principles -- most notably Tobler's First Law of Geography -- into\nan iterative prediction loop. In GeoSR, the reasoning process is decomposed\ninto three collaborating agents: (1) a variable-selection agent that selects\nrelevant covariates from the same location; (2) a point-selection agent that\nchooses reference predictions at nearby locations generated by the LLM in\nprevious rounds; and (3) a refine agent that coordinates the iterative\nrefinement process by evaluating prediction quality and triggering further\nrounds when necessary. This agentic loop progressively improves prediction\nquality by leveraging both spatial dependencies and inter-variable\nrelationships. We validate GeoSR on tasks ranging from physical-world property\nestimation to socioeconomic prediction.

Soil horizon classification, for instance, remains\nchallenging because of its multimodal and multitask characteristics and a\ncomplex hierarchically structured label taxonomy. Accurate classification of\nsoil horizons is crucial for monitoring soil health, which directly impacts\nagricultural productivity, food security, ecosystem stability and climate\nresilience. In this work, we propose $\\textit{SoilNet}$ - a multimodal\nmultitask model to tackle this problem through a structured modularized\npipeline. Our approach integrates image data and geotemporal metadata to first\npredict depth markers, segmenting the soil profile into horizon candidates.\nEach segment is characterized by a set of horizon-specific morphological\nfeatures. Finally, horizon labels are predicted based on the multimodal\nconcatenated feature vector, leveraging a graph-based label representation to\naccount for the complex hierarchical relationships among soil horizons. Our\nmethod is designed to address complex hierarchical classification, where the\nnumber of possible labels is very large, imbalanced and non-trivially\nstructured.

As bandit algorithms\nare increasingly deployed in these socially sensitive settings, it becomes\ncritical to protect user data privacy and ensure fair treatment across decision\nrounds. While prior work has independently addressed privacy and fairness in\nbandit settings, the question of whether both objectives can be achieved\nsimultaneously has remained largely open. Existing privacy-preserving bandit\nalgorithms typically optimize average regret, a utilitarian measure, whereas\nfairness-aware approaches focus on minimizing Nash regret, which penalizes\ninequitable reward distributions, but often disregard privacy concerns.\n  To bridge this gap, we introduce Differentially Private Nash Confidence Bound\n(DP-NCB)-a novel and unified algorithmic framework that simultaneously ensures\n$\\epsilon$-differential privacy and achieves order-optimal Nash regret,\nmatching known lower bounds up to logarithmic factors.

Instead of asking \"Which\nanswer is most likely?\", DRN asks \"Which hypothesis has the most internally\nconsistent evidence?\". DRN achieves intrinsic interpretability by explicitly\ntracking belief states and quantifying epistemic uncertainty for competing\nhypotheses through an iterative evidence synthesis process. We validate our\napproach through two complementary architectures - a bespoke discriminative\nmodel that embodies the core uncertainty minimization principle, and a\nlightweight verification module that enhances existing generative LLMs.\nEvaluated on LCR-1000, our new adversarial reasoning benchmark designed to\nexpose cognitive traps, the bespoke DRN achieves up to 15.2% improvement over\nstandard baselines. When integrated as a parameter-efficient verifier with\nMistral-7B, our hybrid system boosts accuracy from 20% to 80% on the most\nchallenging problems. Critically, DRN demonstrates strong zero-shot\ngeneralization, improving TruthfulQA performance by 23.6% without additional\ntraining, indicating that uncertainty-driven deliberation learns transferable\nreasoning principles.

Static benchmarks lack agency,\nwhile interactive benchmarks suffer from a severe modal bottleneck, typically\nignoring crucial auditory and temporal cues. To bridge this evaluation chasm,\nwe introduce OmniPlay, a diagnostic benchmark designed not just to evaluate,\nbut to probe the fusion and reasoning capabilities of agentic models across the\nfull sensory spectrum. Built on a core philosophy of modality interdependence,\nOmniPlay comprises a suite of five game environments that systematically create\nscenarios of both synergy and conflict, forcing agents to perform genuine\ncross-modal reasoning. Our comprehensive evaluation of six leading omni-modal\nmodels reveals a critical dichotomy: they exhibit superhuman performance on\nhigh-fidelity memory tasks but suffer from systemic failures in challenges\nrequiring robust reasoning and strategic planning. We demonstrate that this\nfragility stems from brittle fusion mechanisms, which lead to catastrophic\nperformance degradation under modality conflict and uncover a counter-intuitive\n\"less is more\" paradox, where removing sensory information can paradoxically\nimprove performance.

Our\napproach captures the complex temporal dynamics of treatment by unifying two\ncontrol modalities: \\textit{impulse control} for discrete, fast-acting\ninterventions (e.g., insulin boluses), and \\textit{switching control} for\nlonger-acting treatments and regime shifts. The core of our method is a\nconstrained Markov decision process augmented with physiological state\nfeatures, enabling safe policy learning under clinical and resource\nconstraints. The framework incorporates biologically realistic factors,\nincluding insulin decay, leading to policies that better reflect real-world\ntherapeutic behaviour. While not intended for clinical deployment, this work\nestablishes a foundation for future safe and temporally-aware RL in healthcare.\nWe provide theoretical guarantees of convergence and demonstrate empirical\nimprovements in a stylised T1DM control task, reducing blood glucose level\nviolations from 22.4\\% (state-of-the-art) to as low as 10.8\\%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc81c1\ud615 \ub2f9\ub1e8\ubcd1 \uce58\ub8cc\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uce58\ub8cc\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \ub3d9\ud559\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uc5ec \uc548\uc804\ud55c \uc815\ucc45 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc81c1\ud615 \ub2f9\ub1e8\ubcd1(T1DM)\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ub9cc\uc131 \uc9c8\ud658\uc5d0\uc11c \uce58\ub8cc\ub97c \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \uc0dd\ub9ac\uc801 \ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0(\uc989, \uc784\ud384\uc2a4 \uc81c\uc5b4\uc640 \uc2a4\uc704\uce6d \uc81c\uc5b4)\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uce58\ub8cc\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \ub3d9\ud559\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \uc81c\uc57d\ub41c \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uacb0\uc815 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc218\ub834 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, T1DM \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud608\ub2f9 \uc218\uc900 \uc704\ubc18\uc728\uc744 22.4%\uc5d0\uc11c 10.8%\ub85c \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ucf30\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud5a5\ud6c4 \uc548\uc804\ud558\uace0 \uc2dc\uac04\uc774 \uc778\uc2dd\ub41c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \ub9c8\ub828\ud558\uc600\uace0 \uc784\uc0c1 \ubc30\uce58\uc5d0\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub3c4\ub85d \uc124\uacc4\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4."}}

We propose a combined manifold and machine\nlearning approach to learn the discrete evolution operator for the emergent\ncrowd dynamics in latent spaces from high-fidelity agent-based simulations. The\nproposed framework builds upon our previous works on next-generation\nEquation-free algorithms on learning surrogate models for high-dimensional and\nmultiscale systems. Our approach is a four-stage one, explicitly conserving the\nmass of the reconstructed dynamics in the high-dimensional space. In the first\nstep, we derive continuous macroscopic fields (densities) from discrete\nmicroscopic data (pedestrians' positions) using KDE. In the second step, based\non manifold learning, we construct a map from the macroscopic ambient space\ninto the latent space parametrized by a few coordinates based on POD of the\ncorresponding density distribution. The third step involves learning\nreduced-order surrogate ROMs in the latent space using machine learning\ntechniques, particularly LSTMs networks and MVARs. Finally, we reconstruct the\ncrowd dynamics in the high-dimensional space in terms of macroscopic density\nprofiles. We demonstrate that the POD reconstruction of the density\ndistribution via SVD conserves the mass. With this \"embed->learn in latent\nspace->lift back to the ambient space\" pipeline, we create an effective\nsolution operator of the unavailable macroscopic PDE for the density evolution.\nFor our illustrations, we use the Social Force Model to generate data in a\ncorridor with an obstacle, imposing periodic boundary conditions.

This leads to\nexcessive computational costs and increased latency, limiting the practical\ndeployment of LRMs. The root cause lies in the absence of intrinsic regulatory\nmechanisms, as current models are unable to monitor and adaptively manage their\nreasoning process to determine when to continue, backtrack, or terminate. To\naddress this issue, we propose the Meta-cognitive Reasoning Framework (MERA),\nwhich explicitly decouples the thinking process into distinct reasoning and\ncontrol components, thereby enabling the independent optimization of control\nstrategies. Specifically, MERA incorporates a takeover-based data construction\nmechanism that identifies critical decision points during reasoning and\ndelegates the creation of control signals to auxiliary LLMs, thereby enabling\nthe construction of high-quality reasoning-control data. Additionally, a\nstructured reasoning-control separation is implemented via supervised\nfine-tuning, enabling the model to generate explicit traces and acquire initial\nmeta-cognitive control capabilities. Finally, MERA employs Control-Segment\nPolicy Optimization (CSPO), which combines segment-wise Group Relative Policy\nOptimization (GRPO) with a control-masking mechanism to optimize control\nbehavior learning while minimizing interference from irrelevant content.\nExperiments on various reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that models trained\nwith MERA enhance both reasoning efficiency and accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "MERA\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801 \uc0ac\uace0 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uc870\uc808\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0ac\uace0\uc640 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub97c \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\uc5ec \uba54\ud0c0 \uc778\uc9c0\uc801 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub97c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\ub294 \ubd88\ud544\uc694\ud55c \uacfc\ub3c4\ud55c \uc0ac\uace0\uc640 \uc5f0\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9 \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0.", "method": "MERA\ub294 \uc0ac\uace0 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ucd94\ub860\uacfc \uc81c\uc5b4\ub85c \uba85\ud655\ud788 \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\uace0, \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ub0b4\ub9ac\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc9c0\uc810\uc744 \ud30c\uc545\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf4\uc870 LLMs\uc5d0 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc2e0\ud638 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc704\uc784\ud558\ub294 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9.", "result": "MERA\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ucd94\ub860 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0b4.", "conclusion": "MERA\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uba54\ud0c0 \uc778\uc9c0\uc801 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf1c, \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \ubc30\ud3ec \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc778\ub2e4."}}

In these domains,\nfairness is often evaluated over risk scores rather than binary outcomes, and a\ncommon challenge is that enforcing strict fairness can significantly degrade\nAUC performance. To address this challenge, we propose Fair Proportional\nOptimal Transport (FairPOT), a novel, model-agnostic post-processing framework\nthat strategically aligns risk score distributions across different groups\nusing optimal transport, but does so selectively by transforming a controllable\nproportion, i.e., the top-lambda quantile, of scores within the disadvantaged\ngroup. By varying lambda, our method allows for a tunable trade-off between\nreducing AUC disparities and maintaining overall AUC performance. Furthermore,\nwe extend FairPOT to the partial AUC setting, enabling fairness interventions\nto concentrate on the highest-risk regions. Extensive experiments on synthetic,\npublic, and clinical datasets show that FairPOT consistently outperforms\nexisting post-processing techniques in both global and partial AUC scenarios,\noften achieving improved fairness with slight AUC degradation or even positive\ngains in utility.

While prior work has proposed privacy-preserving methods for sensor\ndata, most rely on static, predefined privacy labels or require large\nquantities of private training data, limiting their adaptability and user\nagency.

In recent years, multi-view clustering has attracted increasing\nattention due to its ability to integrate complementary information from\nmultiple views. However, existing methods primarily focus on clustering\nperformance, while fairness-a critical concern in human-centered\napplications-has been largely overlooked. Although recent studies have explored\ngroup fairness in multi-view clustering, most methods impose explicit\nregularization on cluster assignments, relying on the alignment between\nsensitive attributes and the underlying cluster structure. However, this\nassumption often fails in practice and can degrade clustering performance. In\nthis paper, we propose an adversarial fair multi-view clustering (AFMVC)\nframework that integrates fairness learning into the representation learning\nprocess.

Existing Private Inference (PI)\nmethods face a fundamental trade-off between privacy and efficiency:\ncryptographic approaches offer strong protection but incur high computational\noverhead, while efficient alternatives such as split inference expose\nintermediate features to inversion attacks. We propose PrivDFS, a new paradigm\nfor private inference that replaces a single exposed representation with\ndistributed feature sharing. PrivDFS partitions input features on the client\ninto multiple balanced shares, which are distributed to non-colluding,\nnon-communicating servers for independent partial inference. The client\nsecurely aggregates the servers' outputs to reconstruct the final prediction,\nensuring that no single server observes sufficient information to compromise\ninput privacy. To further strengthen privacy, we propose two key extensions:\nPrivDFS-AT, which uses adversarial training with a diffusion-based proxy\nattacker to enforce inversion-resistant feature partitioning, and PrivDFS-KD,\nwhich leverages user-specific keys to diversify partitioning policies and\nprevent query-based inversion generalization. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and\nCelebA demonstrate that PrivDFS achieves privacy comparable to deep split\ninference while cutting client computation by up to 100 times with no accuracy\nloss, and that the extensions remain robust against both diffusion-based\nin-distribution and adaptive attacks.", "AI": {"tldr": "PrivDFS\ub294 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc0ac\uc124 \ucd94\ub860 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc73c\ub85c, \uae30\ub2a5 \ubd84\ud560\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uac1c\uc778\uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638\uc640 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uac1c\uc120\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uac1c\uc778 \ucd94\ub860 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uac1c\uc778\uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638\uc640 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ub4dc\uc624\ud504\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uac1c\uc120\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "PrivDFS\ub294 \uc785\ub825 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \ubd84\ud560\ud558\uc5ec \ube44\uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uc11c\ubc84\uc5d0 \ubd84\ubc30\ud558\uace0, \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\uac00 \uac01 \uc11c\ubc84\uc758 \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \uc548\uc804\ud558\uac8c \uc9d1\uacc4\ud558\uc5ec \ucd5c\uc885 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774\ub2e4.", "result": "PrivDFS\ub294 CIFAR-10\uacfc CelebA\uc5d0\uc11c \uac1c\uc778\uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\uc758 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc744 \ucd5c\ub300 100\ubc30 \uc904\uc5ec \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc758 \uc190\uc2e4 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud655\uc7a5(PrivDFS-AT \ubc0f PrivDFS-KD)\uc740 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac15\uc778\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638\ub97c \uac15\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

Parallel to this\nprogress, the demand for explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has spurred\na growing body of research aimed at interpreting the complex decision-making\nprocesses of these models. This systematic literature review analyzes research\npublished between January 2020 and early 2024 that focuses on the\nexplainability of multimodal models. Framed within the broader goals of XAI, we\nexamine the literature across multiple dimensions, including model\narchitecture, modalities involved, explanation algorithms and evaluation\nmethodologies. Our analysis reveals that the majority of studies are\nconcentrated on vision-language and language-only models, with attention-based\ntechniques being the most commonly employed for explanation. However, these\nmethods often fall short in capturing the full spectrum of interactions between\nmodalities, a challenge further compounded by the architectural heterogeneity\nacross domains.

Freeman"], "title": "Hierarchical Scoring for Machine Learning Classifier Error Impact Evaluation", "comment": null, "summary": "A common use of machine learning (ML) models is predicting the class of a\nsample. Object detection is an extension of classification that includes\nlocalization of the object via a bounding box within the sample.\nClassification, and by extension object detection, is typically evaluated by\ncounting a prediction as incorrect if the predicted label does not match the\nground truth label. This pass/fail scoring treats all misclassifications as\nequivalent. In many cases, class labels can be organized into a class taxonomy\nwith a hierarchical structure to either reflect relationships among the data or\noperator valuation of misclassifications. When such a hierarchical structure\nexists, hierarchical scoring metrics can return the model performance of a\ngiven prediction related to the distance between the prediction and the ground\ntruth label. Such metrics can be viewed as giving partial credit to predictions\ninstead of pass/fail, enabling a finer-grained understanding of the impact of\nmisclassifications. This work develops hierarchical scoring metrics varying in\ncomplexity that utilize scoring trees to encode relationships between class\nlabels and produce metrics that reflect distance in the scoring tree. The\nscoring metrics are demonstrated on an abstract use case with scoring trees\nthat represent three weighting strategies and evaluated by the kind of errors\ndiscouraged.

Following the feature extractor,\nwe further develop an analytic classifier for gradient-free training. To\nsupport both collective generalization and individual personalization, our\nFedHiP scheme incorporates three phases: analytic local training, analytic\nglobal aggregation, and analytic local personalization. The closed-form\nsolutions of our FedHiP scheme enable its ideal property of heterogeneity\ninvariance, meaning that each personalized model remains identical regardless\nof how non-IID the data are distributed across all other clients. Extensive\nexperiments on benchmark datasets validate the superiority of our FedHiP\nscheme, outperforming the state-of-the-art baselines by at least 5.79%-20.97%\nin accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "FedHiP\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \uae30\ubc18 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \ud68c\ud53c\ud558\ub294 \uac1c\uc778\ud654 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 \uac1c\uc778\ud654 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5(PFL) \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uace0\uac1d \uac04\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc218\ub834\uc131\uc774 \uc800\ud558\ub418\uace0 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc800\ud558\ub418\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \uae30\ubc18 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \ud53c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub2eb\ud78c \ud615\ud0dc\uc758 \ud574\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c FedHiP \ubc29\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc790\uae30 \uac10\ub3c5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \ud504\ub9ac\ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ub2dd\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "FedHiP\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uac00 \ucd5c\uc18c 5.79%-20.97% \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub41c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "FedHiP\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uace0\uac1d\uc5d0\uc11c \ube44\uc2b7\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc640 \uc0c1\uad00\uc5c6\uc774 \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

While\nGraph Neural Networks (GNNs) have significantly advanced LP performance\nrecently, existing methods face key challenges including limited supervision\nfrom sparse connectivity, sensitivity to initialization, and poor\ngeneralization under distribution shifts.

However,\ntraffic data is typically distributed among multiple data owners, and privacy\nconstraints prevent the direct utilization of these isolated datasets for\ntraffic prediction. Most existing federated traffic prediction methods focus on\ndesigning communication mechanisms that allow models to leverage information\nfrom other clients in order to improve prediction accuracy. Unfortunately, such\napproaches often incur substantial communication overhead, and the resulting\ntransmission delays significantly slow down the training process. As the volume\nof traffic data continues to grow, this issue becomes increasingly critical,\nmaking the resource consumption of current methods unsustainable. To address\nthis challenge, we propose a novel variable relationship modeling paradigm for\nfederated traffic prediction, termed the Channel-Independent Paradigm(CIP).\nUnlike traditional approaches, CIP eliminates the need for inter-client\ncommunication by enabling each node to perform efficient and accurate\npredictions using only local information. Based on the CIP, we further develop\nFed-CI, an efficient federated learning framework, allowing each client to\nprocess its own data independently while effectively mitigating the information\nloss caused by the lack of direct data sharing among clients. Fed-CI\nsignificantly reduces communication overhead, accelerates the training process,\nand achieves state-of-the-art performance while complying with privacy\nregulations. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate\nthat Fed-CI consistently outperforms existing methods across all datasets and\nfederated settings.

Its measurement requires destructive testing, limiting the potential\nfor efficient quality control. Physics-informed neural networks were\ninvestigated as a promising tool to reconstruct internal process states from\nexperimental data, enabling model-based and non-invasive quality assessment in\naluminum spot welding. A major challenge is the integration of real-world data\ninto the network due to competing optimization objectives. To address this, we\nintroduce two novel training strategies. First, experimental losses for dynamic\ndisplacement and nugget diameter are progressively included using a fading-in\nfunction to prevent excessive optimization conflicts. We also implement a\ncustom learning rate scheduler and early stopping based on a rolling window to\ncounteract premature reduction due to increased loss magnitudes. Second, we\nintroduce a conditional update of temperature-dependent material parameters via\na look-up table, activated only after a loss threshold is reached to ensure\nphysically meaningful temperatures. An axially symmetric two-dimensional model\nwas selected to represent the welding process accurately while maintaining\ncomputational efficiency. To reduce computational burden, the training\nstrategies and model components were first systematically evaluated in one\ndimension, enabling controlled analysis of loss design and contact models.

In this new release, Perch 2.0, we expand from training exclusively\non avian species to a large multi-taxa dataset. The model is trained with\nself-distillation using a prototype-learning classifier as well as a new\nsource-prediction training criterion. Perch 2.0 obtains state-of-the-art\nperformance on the BirdSet and BEANS benchmarks. It also outperforms\nspecialized marine models on marine transfer learning tasks, despite having\nalmost no marine training data. We present hypotheses as to why fine-grained\nspecies classification is a particularly robust pre-training task for\nbioacoustics.", "AI": {"tldr": "Perch 2.0\ub294 \ub2e4\uc138\ub300 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uc0dd\ubb3c\uc74c\ud5a5 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c, \uc0c8 \ubc0f \ud574\uc591 \uc0dd\ubb3c \ubd84\ub958\uc5d0\uc11c \ud0c1\uc6d4\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc0dd\ubb3c\uc74c\ud5a5 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc885\uc758 \uc74c\uc131\uc744 \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \ubd84\ub958\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "\uc790\uae30 \uc99d\ub958\uc640 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ud0c0\uc785 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubd84\ub958\uae30\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\uace0 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc18c\uc2a4 \uc608\uce21 \ud6c8\ub828 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud588\ub2e4.", "result": "Perch 2.0\ub294 BirdSet\uacfc BEANS \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc0c1\uc704 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uae30\ub85d\ud588\uc73c\uba70, \ud574\uc591 \uc804\uc774 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc804\ubb38 \ud574\uc591 \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubbf8\uc138\ud55c \uc885 \ubd84\ub958\uac00 \uc0dd\ubb3c\uc74c\ud5a5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc791\uc5c5\uc774 \ub418\ub294 \uc774\uc720\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac00\uc124\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uc600\ub2e4."}}

Prior work for the case of unknown activation\neither does not attain constant factor approximation or succeeds for a\nsubstantially smaller family of activations.
