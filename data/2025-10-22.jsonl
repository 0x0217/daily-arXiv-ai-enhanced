Secondly, with zero-accuracy problems in\nprevious rollout stage, it further prompts policy to refine these answers by\nreferencing previous wrong solutions.

Such interactions between users and an\nalgorithm often unfold over multiple steps, during which strategic users can\nguide the algorithm to better align with their true interests by selectively\nengaging with content. However, users frequently exhibit inconsistent\npreferences: they may spend considerable time on content that offers little\nlong-term value, inadvertently signaling that such content is desirable.\nFocusing on the user side, this raises a key question: what does it take for\nsuch users to align the algorithm with their true interests?\n  To investigate these dynamics, we model the user's decision process as split\nbetween a rational system 2 that decides whether to engage and an impulsive\nsystem 1 that determines how long engagement lasts. We then study a\nmulti-leader, single-follower extensive Stackelberg game, where users,\nspecifically system 2, lead by committing to engagement strategies and the\nalgorithm best-responds based on observed interactions. We define the burden of\nalignment as the minimum horizon over which users must optimize to effectively\nsteer the algorithm. We show that a critical horizon exists: users who are\nsufficiently foresighted can achieve alignment, while those who are not are\ninstead aligned to the algorithm's objective. This critical horizon can be\nlong, imposing a substantial burden. However, even a small, costly signal\n(e.g., an extra click) can significantly reduce it. Overall, our framework\nexplains how users with inconsistent preferences can align an engagement-driven\nalgorithm with their interests in a Stackelberg equilibrium, highlighting both\nthe challenges and potential remedies for achieving alignment."}

No updates will be made to it during the application. This is\ninappropriate for many dynamic and open environments, where unexpected samples\nfrom unseen classes may appear. In such an environment, the model should be\nable to detect these novel samples from unseen classes and learn them after\nthey are labeled. We call this paradigm Autonomous Learning after Model\nDeployment (ALMD). The learning here is continuous and involves no human\nengineers. Labeling in this scenario is performed by human co-workers or other\nknowledgeable agents, which is similar to what humans do when they encounter an\nunfamiliar object and ask another person for its name. In ALMD, the detection\nof novel samples is dynamic and differs from traditional out-of-distribution\n(OOD) detection in that the set of in-distribution (ID) classes expands as new\nclasses are learned during application, whereas ID classes is fixed in\ntraditional OOD detection. Learning is also different from classic supervised\nlearning because in ALMD, we learn the encountered new classes immediately and\nincrementally. It is difficult to retrain the model from scratch using all the\npast data from the ID classes and the novel samples from newly discovered\nclasses, as this would be resource- and time-consuming. Apart from these two\nchallenges, ALMD faces the data scarcity issue because instances of new classes\noften appear sporadically in real-life applications. To address these issues,\nwe propose a novel method, PLDA, which performs dynamic OOD detection and\nincremental learning of new classes on the fly. Empirical evaluations will\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of PLDA."}

The influence of social bots within these platforms has garnered\nconsiderable attention from researchers, leading to the development of numerous\ndetection technologies.

Existing Graph Neural Network\n(GNN)-based methods cannot be directly applied due to the issues of limited\ncontrol over social agents, the black-box nature of bot detectors, and the\nheterogeneity of bots. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the\nfirst adversarial multi-agent Reinforcement learning framework for social Bot\ncontrol attacks (RoBCtrl) targeting GNN-based social bot detectors.\nSpecifically, we use a diffusion model to generate high-fidelity bot accounts\nby reconstructing existing account data with minor modifications, thereby\nevading detection on social platforms. To the best of our knowledge, this is\nthe first application of diffusion models to mimic the behavior of evolving\nsocial bots effectively. We then employ a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning\n(MARL) method to simulate bots adversarial behavior. We categorize social\naccounts based on their influence and budget. Different agents are then\nemployed to control bot accounts across various categories, optimizing the\nattachment strategy through reinforcement learning. Additionally, a\nhierarchical state abstraction based on structural entropy is designed to\naccelerate the reinforcement learning.

We\napproximate the L-infinity gradient using the logarithm of the sum of\nexponential absolute values to tightly control perturbation magnitude. On\nCIFAR-10 and ImageNet, ATOS achieves a 100% attack success rate while producing\nsignificantly sparser and more structurally coherent perturbations than prior\nmethods. The structured group-wise attack highlights critical regions from the\nnetwork's perspective, providing counterfactual explanations by replacing\nclass-defining regions with robust features from the target class."}

Here, we introduce a novel and realistic setting named domain\ngeneralizable continual learning (DGCL): a model learns sequential tasks with\neach involving a single domain, aiming to perform well across all encountered\ntasks and domains. This setting poses unique challenges in acquiring,\nretaining, and leveraging both semantic- and domain-relevant information for\nrobust generalization. Although state-of-the-art continual learning (CL)\nmethods have employed pre-trained models (PTMs) to enhance task-specific\ngeneralization, they typically assume identical training and testing domains\nfor each task and therefore perform poorly in DGCL. To this end, we propose\nadaptive Domain Transformation (DoT), an innovative PTMs-based approach\ntailored to DGCL. Inspired by the distributed-plus-hub theory of the human\nbrain, DoT disentangles semantic- and domain-relevant information in\nrepresentation learning, and adaptively transforms task representations across\nvarious domains for output alignment, ensuring balanced and generalized\npredictions. DoT serves as a plug-in strategy that greatly facilitates\nstate-of-the-art CL baselines under both full parameter tuning and\nparameter-efficient tuning paradigms in DGCL, validated by extensive\nexperiments. Also, DoT is shown to accumulate domain-generalizable knowledge\nfrom DGCL, and ensure resource efficiency with a lightweight implementation."}
