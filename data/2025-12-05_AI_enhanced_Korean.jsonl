It raises some risk factors for existing governance approaches as they remain fragmented: Existing frameworks are either static taxonomies driven; however, they lack an integrated end-to-end pipeline from risk identification to operational assurance, especially for an agentic platform. We propose AGENTSAFE, a practical governance framework for LLM-based agentic systems. The framework operationalises the AI Risk Repository into design, runtime, and audit controls, offering a governance framework for risk identification and assurance. The proposed framework, AGENTSAFE, profiles agentic loops (plan -> act -> observe -> reflect) and toolchains, and maps risks onto structured taxonomies extended with agent-specific vulnerabilities. It introduces safeguards that constrain risky behaviours, escalates high-impact actions to human oversight, and evaluates systems through pre-deployment scenario banks spanning security, privacy, fairness, and systemic safety. During deployment, AGENTSAFE ensures continuous governance through semantic telemetry, dynamic authorization, anomaly detection, and interruptibility mechanisms. Provenance and accountability are reinforced through cryptographic tracing and organizational controls, enabling measurable, auditable assurance across the lifecycle of agentic AI systems. The key contributions of this paper are: (1) a unified governance framework that translates risk taxonomies into actionable design, runtime, and audit controls; (2) an Agent Safety Evaluation methodology that provides measurable pre-deployment assurance; and (3) a set of runtime governance and accountability mechanisms that institutionalise trust in agentic AI ecosystems.", "AI": {"tldr":

In this context, we address a key open challenge: enabling heterogeneous AI agents to exchange compressed latent-space representations while mitigating semantic noise and preserving task-relevant meaning. We cast this challenge as learning both the communication topology and the alignment maps that govern information exchange among agents, yielding a learned network sheaf equipped with orthogonal maps. This learning process is further supported by a semantic denoising end compression module that constructs a shared global semantic space and derives sparse, structured representations of each agent's latent space. This corresponds to a nonconvex dictionary learning problem solved iteratively with closed-form updates. Experiments with mutiple AI agents pre-trained on real image data show that the semantic denoising and compression facilitates AI agents alignment and the extraction of semantic clusters, while preserving high accuracy in downstream task. The resulting communication network provides new insights about semantic heterogeneity across agents, highlighting the interpretability of our methodology.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740

Current structured communication protocols such as direct agent-to-agent messaging or MCP-style tool calls offer reliability, but they struggle to support the emergent and swarm-like intelligence required in large adaptive systems. Distributed agents must learn continuously, share context fluidly, and coordinate without depending solely on central planners.\n  This paper revisits gossip protocols as a complementary substrate for agentic communication. Gossip mechanisms, long valued in distributed systems for their decentralized and fault-tolerant properties, provide scalable and adaptive diffusion of knowledge and fill gaps that structured protocols alone cannot efficiently address. However, gossip also introduces challenges, including semantic relevance, temporal staleness, and limited guarantees on action consistency in rapidly changing environments.\n  We examine how gossip can support context-rich state propagation, resilient coordination under uncertainty, and emergent global awareness. We also outline open problems around semantic filtering, trust, and knowledge decay. Rather than proposing a complete framework, this paper presents a research agenda for integrating gossip into multi-agent communication stacks and argues that gossip is essential for future agentic ecosystems that must remain robust, adaptive, and self-organizing as their scale and autonomy increase.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc758 \ud655\uc7a5\uc5d0

These interactions are shaped by inherent differences in strength, and they often lead to stable dominance patterns that emerge surprisingly quickly relative to the size of the population. This motivates the search for simple mathematical models that capture both heterogeneous agent strength and rapid convergence to stable local dominance.\n  A widely studied abstraction of local dominance is the Maximal Independent Set (MIS) problem. In the Luby MIS protocol that provably converges quickly to an MIS, each agent repeatedly generates a strength value chosen uniformly and becomes locally dominant if its value is smaller than those of its neighbors. This provides a theoretical explanation for fast dominance convergence in populations of equal-strength agents and naturally raises the question of whether fast convergence also holds in the more realistic setting where agents are inherently mixed-strength.\n  To investigate this question, we introduce the mixed-strength agents model, in which each agent draws its strength from its own distribution. We prove that the extension of the Luby MIS protocol where each agent repeatedly generates a strength value from its own distribution still exhibits fast dominance convergence, providing formal confirmation of the rapid convergence observed in many mixed-strength natural processes.\n  We also show that heterogeneity can significantly change the dynamics of the process. In contrast to the equal-strength setting, a constant fraction of edges need not be eliminated per round. We construct a population and strength profile in which progress per round is asymptotically smaller, illustrating how inherent strength asymmetry produces qualitatively different global behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud63c\ud569 \uac15\ub3c4\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ube60\ub978 \uc9c0\ubc30 \uc218\ub834\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \ub3d9\ub825\ud559\uc758 \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \ud0d0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc774 \uc9c0\uc5ed \uacbd\uc7c1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc9c0\ubc30\uc801 \uc704\uce58\ub97c \ucc28\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uc218\ud559\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uace0, \uadf8 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uac15\ub3c4 \ucc28\uc774\uc640 \ube60\ub978 \uc218\ub834\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud568.", "method": "\ud63c\ud569 \uac15\ub3c4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0, \uc790\uccb4 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub3c4 \uac12\uc744 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 Luby MIS \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc758 \ud655\uc7a5\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud568.", "result": "\uac01 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub3c4\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 Luby MIS \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc758 \ud655\uc7a5\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ube60\ub978 \uc9c0\ubc30 \uc218\ub834\uc744 \ubcf4\uc784\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud568.", "conclusion": "\ud63c\ud569 \uac15\ub3c4\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \ube60\ub978 \uc9c0\ubc30 \uc218\ub834\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud588\uc73c\uba70, \uac15\ub3c4 \ube44\ub300\uce6d\uc774 \uc804\uccb4 \ub3d9\uc791\uc5d0 \uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce5c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90c.", "translated_summary": "\ub9ce\uc740 \uc790\uc5f0 \ubc0f \uacf5\ud559 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uac1c\ubcc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5b4\ub5a4 \uc774\ub4e4\uc774 \uadf8\ub4e4\uc758 \uc774\uc6c3 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c0\ubc30\uc801\uc774 \ub418\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uacb0\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc9c0\uc5ed \uacbd\uc7c1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc740 \uac15\ub3c4\uc758 \uace0\uc720\ud55c \ucc28\uc774\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ud615\uc131\ub418\uba70, \uc778\uad6c \uaddc\ubaa8\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ub180\ub77c\uc6b8 \uc815\ub3c4\ub85c \ube60\ub974\uac8c \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc9c0\ubc30 \ud328\ud134\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc9c0\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ub3c4\uc640 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc9c0\uc5ed \uc9c0\ubc30\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ube60\ub978 \uc218\ub834\uc744 \ubaa8\ub450 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \uc218\ud559\uc801 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ucc3e\uace0\uc790 \ud558\ub294 \ub3d9\uae30\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc9c0\uc5ed \uc9c0\ubc30\uc758 \ub110\ub9ac \uc5f0\uad6c\ub41c \ucd94\uc0c1 \uac1c\ub150\uc740 \ucd5c\ub300 \ub3c5\ub9bd \uc9d1\ud569(MIS) \ubb38\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Philosophical analysis of AI alignment (process-based / syntropy framework)", "summary": "I argue that AI alignment should be reconceived as architecting syntropic, reasons-responsive agents through process-based, multi-agent, developmental mechanisms rather than encoding fixed human value content. The paper makes three philosophical contributions. First, I articulate the ``specification trap'' argument demonstrating why content-based value specification appears structurally unstable due to the conjunction of the is-ought gap, value pluralism, and the extended frame problem. Second, I propose syntropy -- the recursive reduction of mutual uncertainty between agents through state alignment -- as an information-theoretic framework for understanding multi-agent alignment dynamics. Third, I establish a functional distinction between genuine and simulated moral capacity grounded in compatibilist theories of guidance control, coupled with an embodied experimental paradigm and verification regime providing operational criteria independent of phenomenological claims.

To date, academic research has mainly focused on improving oracle technology and internal economics, while the drivers of oracle choice on the client side remain largely unexplored. This study fills this gap by gathering insights from leading Web3 protocols, uncovering their rationale for oracle selection and their preferences when deciding whether to outsource or internalize data request mechanisms. The collected data covers more than 55% of the DeFi market cap and is obtained exclusively by protocol executives, board members, or delegates. Insights support the view that protocol choices are tied to technological dependencies, where immutability of smart contracts amplifies lock-in, preventing agile switching among data providers. Furthermore, when viable third-party solutions exist, protocols overwhelmingly prefer outsourcing rather than building and maintaining internal oracle mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 Web3 \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c \uc624\ub77c\ud074 \uc120\ud0dd\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uba70, \uc624\ub77c\ud074 \uc120\ud0dd\uc758 \uace0\uac1d \uce21 \uc694\uc778\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "Web3 \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub294 \ud544\uc218 \uc790\uc0b0\uc774\uba70, \uc624\ub77c\ud074 \uc120\ud0dd\uc740 \uc131\uacf5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uacb0\uc815\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc120\ub3c4\uc801\uc778 Web3 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \uc218\uc9d1\ud558\uc5ec \uc624\ub77c\ud074 \uc120\ud0dd\uc758 \uadfc\uac70\uc640 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc694\uccad \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc758 \uc544\uc6c3\uc18c\uc2f1 \ub610\ub294 \ub0b4\ubd80\ud654 \uacb0\uc815 \uc2dc \uc120\ud638\ub3c4\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud588\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc218\uc9d1\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub294 DeFi \uc2dc\uc7a5 \uac00\uce58\uc758 55% \uc774\uc0c1\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uba70, \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc758 \uacbd\uc601\uc9c4, \uc774\uc0ac\ud68c \uad6c\uc131\uc6d0 \ub610\ub294 \ub300\ub9ac\uc778\uc5d0\uac8c\uc11c \ub3c5\uc810\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5bb\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc758 \uc120\ud0dd\uc740 \uae30\uc220\uc801 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uacfc \uad00\ub828\uc774 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uacc4\uc57d\uc758 \ubd88\ubcc0\uc131\uc774 \uc7a0\uae08 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc81c\uacf5\uc790 \uac04\uc758 \ubbfc\ucca9\ud55c \uc804\ud658\uc744 \ubc29\ud574\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc81c3\uc790 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc774 \uc874\uc7ac\ud560 \uacbd\uc6b0, \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc740 \ub0b4\ubd80 \uc624\ub77c\ud074 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uace0 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uae30\ubcf4\ub2e4\ub294 \uc544\uc6c3\uc18c\uc2f1\uc744 \uc120\ud638\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub370\uc774\ud130\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4e0 Web3 \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc778 \uc790\uc0b0\uc73c\ub85c, \uc624\ub77c\ud074 \uc120\ud0dd\uc740 \uc131\uacf5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uacb0\uc815\uc774\ub2e4. \ud604\uc7ac\uae4c\uc9c0 \ud559\uacc4\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc8fc\ub85c \uc624\ub77c\ud074 \uae30\uc220\uacfc \ub0b4\ubd80 \uacbd\uc81c\ud559 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uace0\uac1d \uce21\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc624\ub77c\ud074 \uc120\ud0dd \uc694\uc778\uc740 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84 \ud0d0\uad6c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc120\ub3c4\uc801\uc778 Web3 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \uc218\uc9d1\ud558\uc5ec \uc624\ub77c\ud074 \uc120\ud0dd\uc758 \uadfc\uac70\uc640 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc694\uccad \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc544\uc6c3\uc18c\uc2f1\ud560\uc9c0 \ub0b4\ubd80\ud654\ud560\uc9c0 \uacb0\uc815\ud560 \ub54c\uc758 \uc120\ud638\ub3c4\ub97c \ubc1d\ud600\ub0b4\uc5b4 \uc774 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \uba54\uc6b0\uace0\uc790 \ud588\ub2e4. \uc218\uc9d1\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub294 DeFi \uc2dc\uc7a5 \uac00\uce58\uc758 55% \uc774\uc0c1\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uba70, \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc758 \uacbd\uc601\uc9c4, \uc774\uc0ac\ud68c \uad6c\uc131\uc6d0 \ub610\ub294 \ub300\ub9ac\uc778\uc5d0\uac8c\uc11c \ub3c5\uc810\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\uc9d1\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \ud1b5\ucc30\ub4e4\uc740 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c \uc120\ud0dd\uc774 \uae30\uc220\uc801 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uacfc \uc5f0\uacb0\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uacc4\uc57d\uc758 \ubd88\ubcc0\uc131\uc774 \uc7a0\uae08 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \uc99d\ub300\uc2dc\ucf1c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc81c\uacf5\uc790 \uac04\uc758 \ubbfc\ucca9\ud55c \uc804\ud658\uc744 \ubc29\ud574\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uacac\ud574\ub97c \ub4b7\ubc1b\uce68\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc81c3\uc790 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc774 \uc874\uc7ac\ud560 \ub54c, \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc740 \ub0b4\ubd80 \uc624\ub77c\ud074 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uace0 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uac83\ubcf4\ub2e4\ub294 \uc544\uc6c3\uc18c\uc2f1\uc744 \uc120\ud638\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

However, the significant resource requirements of FL often exclude centres with limited computational infrastructure, further widening existing healthcare disparities. To address this issue, we propose a Green AI-oriented adaptive layer-freezing strategy designed to reduce energy consumption and computational load while maintaining model performance. We tested our approach using different federated architectures for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-to-Computed Tomography (CT) conversion. The proposed adaptive strategy optimises the federated training by selectively freezing the encoder weights based on the monitored relative difference of the encoder weights from round to round. A patience-based mechanism ensures that freezing only occurs when updates remain consistently minimal. The energy consumption and CO2eq emissions of the federation were tracked using the CodeCarbon library. Compared to equivalent non-frozen counterparts, our approach reduced training time, total energy consumption and CO2eq emissions by up to 23%. At the same time, the MRI-to-CT conversion performance was maintained, with only small variations in the Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Notably, for three out of the five evaluated architectures, no statistically significant differences were observed, while two architectures exhibited statistically significant improvements. Our work aligns with a research paradigm that promotes DL-based frameworks meeting clinical requirements while ensuring climatic, social, and economic sustainability. It lays the groundwork for novel FL evaluation frameworks, advancing privacy, equity and, more broadly, justice in AI-driven healthcare.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc790\uc6d0

We introduce AsymPuzl, a minimal but expressive two-agent puzzle environment designed to isolate communication under information asymmetry. Each agent observes complementary but incomplete views of a symbolic puzzle and must exchange messages to solve it cooperatively. Using a diverse set of current-generation and open-source LLMs, we show that (i) strong models such as GPT-5 and Claude-4.0 reliably converge across puzzle sizes on the solution by sharing complete information in two turns, (ii) weaker models often ignore partner messages or over-correct their hypotheses, and (iii) feedback design is non-trivial: simple self-feedback improves success rates, while detailed joint feedback can hurt performance. These findings show that even in simple cooperative tasks, LLM communication strategies diverge and depend on the granularity of feedback signals. AsymPuzl thus provides a testbed for probing the limits of multi-turn cooperation and opens avenues for studying coordination mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "AsymPuzl\uc740 \uc815\ubcf4 \ube44\ub300\uce6d \ud558\uc758 \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc744 \uace0\ub9bd\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \ub450 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud37c\uc990 \ud658\uacbd\uc73c\ub85c, LLM\uc758 \ud611\ub825\uc801 \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub41c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \uae30\uc874 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc5f4\ub9b0 \uc5ed\ud560 \ub180\uc774\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uace0 \uc788\uc5b4 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\uc81c\ub41c \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uac01 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc0c1\uc9d5\uc801 \ud37c\uc990\uc758 \ubcf4\uc644\uc801\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc \ubd88\uc644\uc804\ud55c \uc2dc\uac01\uc744 \uad00\ucc30\ud558\uace0 \ud574\uacb0\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0\ub97c \uad50\ud658\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uac15\ub825\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ub450 \ucc28\ub840\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc644\uc804 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uacf5\uc720\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0\uc5d0 \uc218\ub834\ud558\ub294 \ubc18\uba74, \uc57d\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ud30c\ud2b8\ub108 \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0\ub97c \ubb34\uc2dc\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uac00\uc124\uc744 \uacfc\ub3c4\ud558\uac8c \uc218\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "LLM \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ucf00\uc774\uc158 \uc804\ub7b5\uc740 \ud611\ub825 \uc791\uc5c5\uc774 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud568\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \ub2e4\ub974\uba70 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \uc2e0\ud638\uc758 \uc138\ubd80 \uc218\uc900\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ub2ec\ub77c\uc9c4\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud134, \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \uc124\uc815\uc740 \ud1b5\uc81c\ub41c \ud3c9\uac00\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uac1c\ubc29\ud615 \ub864\ud50c\ub808\uc774\uc5d0 \uc911\uc810\uc744 \ub450\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc815\ubcf4 \ube44\ub300\uce6d \ud558\uc758 \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc744 \uace0\ub9bd\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \ucd5c\uc18c\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ud45c\ud604\ub825\uc774 \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \ub450 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud37c\uc990 \ud658\uacbd\uc778 AsymPuzl\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uac01 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc0c1\uc9d5\uc801 \ud37c\uc990\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubcf4\uc644\uc801\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc \ubd88\uc644\uc804\ud55c \uad00\uc810\uc744 \uad00\ucc30\ud558\uace0 \ud611\ub825\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0\ub97c \uad50\ud658\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud604\uc7ac \uc138\ub300 \ubc0f \uc624\ud508 \uc18c\uc2a4 LLM\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, (i) GPT-5 \ubc0f Claude-4.0\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ub450 \ud134\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc644\uc804\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uacf5\uc720\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ud37c\uc990 \ud06c\uae30 \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uc788\uac8c \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc5d0 \uc218\ub834\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\ub2e4, (ii) \uc57d\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \ud30c\ud2b8\ub108 \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0\ub97c \ubb34\uc2dc\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uac00\uc124\uc744 \uacfc\ub3c4\ud558\uac8c \uc218\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4, (iii) \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \ub514\uc790\uc778\uc740 \uac04\ub2e8\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba70: \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \uc790\uae30 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc740 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc0c1\uc138\ud55c \uacf5\ub3d9 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0 \ud574\ub97c \ub07c\uce60 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc1c\uacac\uc740 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \ud611\ub825 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 LLM \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ucf00\uc774\uc158 \uc804\ub7b5\uc774 \ub2e4\ub974\uace0 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \uc2e0\ud638\uc758 \uc138\ubd84\uc131\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ub2ec\ub77c\uc9c4\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c AsymPuzl\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud134 \ud611\ub825\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud0d0\uad6c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ubca0\ub4dc\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70 \uc870\uc815 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uae38\uc744 \uc5f4\uc5b4\uc900\ub2e4."}}

The architecture deconstructs cognition into indivisible Logical Atoms and two fundamental operations: Pointing and Comparison. Decision-making is formalized through an interpretable Weight-Calculation model (Weight = Benefit * Probability), where all values are traceable to an auditable set of Initial Weights. This atomic decomposition enables radical explainability, intrinsic generality for novel situations, and traceable value alignment. We detail its implementation via a graph-algorithm-based computational engine and a global workspace workflow, supported by a preliminary code implementation and scenario validation.

In many cases, it could be useful to have emergency shutdown mechanisms which effectively prevent misaligned agents from carrying out harmful actions in the world. We introduce password-activated shutdown protocols (PAS protocols) -- methods for designing frontier agents to implement a safe shutdown protocol when given a password. We motivate PAS protocols by describing intuitive use-cases in which they mitigate risks from misaligned systems that subvert other control efforts, for instance, by disabling automated monitors or self-exfiltrating to external data centres. PAS protocols supplement other safety efforts, such as alignment fine-tuning or monitoring, contributing to defence-in-depth against AI risk. We provide a concrete demonstration in SHADE-Arena, a benchmark for AI monitoring and subversion capabilities, in which PAS protocols supplement monitoring to increase safety with little cost to performance. Next, PAS protocols should be robust to malicious actors who want to bypass shutdown. Therefore, we conduct a red-team blue-team game between the developers (blue-team), who must implement a robust PAS protocol, and a red-team trying to subvert the protocol. We conduct experiments in a code-generation setting, finding that there are effective strategies for the red-team, such as using another model to filter inputs, or fine-tuning the model to prevent shutdown behaviour. We then outline key challenges to implementing PAS protocols in real-life systems, including: security considerations of the password and decisions regarding when, and in which systems, to use them. PAS protocols are an intuitive mechanism for increasing the safety of frontier AI. We encourage developers to consider implementing PAS protocols prior to internal deployment of particularly dangerous systems to reduce loss-of-control risks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ube44\uc0c1 \uc885\ub8cc \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc778 \ube44\ubc00\ubc88\ud638 \ud65c\uc131\ud654 \uc885\ub8cc \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c(PAS \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c)\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \ube44\uc815\ub82c\ub41c AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ube44\uc815\ub82c\ub41c AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \ub2e4\ub978 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ub178\ub825\uc744 \ubc29\ud574\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc9c1\uad00\uc801\uc778 \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uc0ac\ub840\ub97c \uc124\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ube44\ubc00\ubc88\ud638\uac00 \uc8fc\uc5b4\uc84c\uc744 \ub54c \uc548\uc804\ud55c \uc885\ub8cc \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \uad6c\ud604\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud504\ub860\ud2f0\uc5b4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc124\uacc4\ud558\ub294 PAS \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "SHADE-Arena\uc5d0\uc11c PAS \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc740 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\uc744 \ubcf4\uc644\ud558\uc5ec \uc131\ub2a5 \uc190\uc2e4 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\uc5f0\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ube44\ubc00\ubc88\ud638\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubcf4\uc548 \uace0\ub824 \ubc0f \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uc2dc\uae30\uc640 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uacb0\uc815\uacfc \uac19\uc740 PAS \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c \uad6c\ud604\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uc124\uba85\ud558\uba70, \uac1c\ubc1c\uc790\ub4e4\uc774 \uc704\ud5d8 \uac10\uc18c\ub97c \uc704\ud574 PAS \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud560 \uac83\uc744 \uad8c\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uc804\uc120 AI \uac1c\ubc1c\uc790\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc815\ub82c\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc81c\uc5b4\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9ce\uc740 \uacbd\uc6b0 \ube44\uc815\ub82c\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc138\uc0c1\uc5d0\uc11c \ud574\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubc29\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ube44\uc0c1 \uc885\ub8cc \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774 \uc720\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ube44\ubc00\ubc88\ud638\uac00 \ud65c\uc131\ud654\ub41c \uc885\ub8cc \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c(PAS \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c)\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ube44\ubc00\ubc88\ud638\ub97c \ubc1b\uc558\uc744 \ub54c \uc548\uc804\ud55c \uc885\ub8cc \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \uad6c\ud604\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ucd5c\uc804\uc120 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc124\uacc4\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 PAS \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc758 \ub3d9\uae30\ub97c \uc124\uba85\ud558\uba74\uc11c, \uc790\ub3d9 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub97c \ube44\ud65c\uc131\ud654\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc678\ubd80 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc13c\ud130\ub85c \uc790\uccb4 \uc720\ucd9c\ud558\ub294 \ub4f1\uc758 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ub178\ub825\uc744 \uc7a0\uc2dd\ud558\ub294 \ube44\uc815\ub82c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc9c1\uad00\uc801\uc778 \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uc0ac\ub840\ub97c \uc124\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

While 3D coronary artery digital twins reconstructed from imaging offer detailed anatomy for personalized assessment, their analysis relies on computationally intensive computational fluid dynamics (CFD), limiting scalability. Data-driven approaches are hindered by scarce labeled data and lack of physiological priors. To address this, we present PINS-CAD, a physics-informed self-supervised learning framework. It pre-trains graph neural networks on 200,000 synthetic coronary digital twins to predict pressure and flow, guided by 1D Navier-Stokes equations and pressure-drop laws, eliminating the need for CFD or labeled data. When fine-tuned on clinical data from 635 patients in the multicenter FAME2 study, PINS-CAD predicts future cardiovascular events with an AUC of 0.73, outperforming clinical risk scores and data-driven baselines. This demonstrates that physics-informed pretraining boosts sample efficiency and yields physiologically meaningful representations.

The exploitative drive, or what an agent wants to achieve, is formalised as the Kullback-Leibler divergence between a variational probability distribution, updated at each inference step, and a preference probability distribution that indicates what states or observations are more likely for the agent, hence determining the agent's goal in a certain environment. In the literature, the questions of how the preference distribution should be specified and of how a certain specification impacts inference and learning in an active inference agent have been given hardly any attention. In this work, we consider four possible ways of defining the preference distribution, either providing the agents with hard or soft goals and either involving or not goal shaping (i.e., intermediate goals). We compare the performances of four agents, each given one of the possible preference distributions, in a grid world navigation task. Our results show that goal shaping enables the best performance overall (i.e., it promotes exploitation) while sacrificing learning about the environment's transition dynamics (i.e., it hampers exploration).", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc801\uadf9\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc740 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc801 \ubc0f \ud65c\uc6a9\uc801 \ub3d9\uae30\ub97c \uc801\uc808\ud788 \uade0\ud615 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uacc4\ud68d \ubc0f \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \uc608\uc0c1 \uc790\uc720 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc120\ud638 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc758 \uc815\uc758\uc640 \uadf8\uac83\uc774 \uc801\uadf9\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c \uc120\ud638 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \uc815\uc758\ud558\uace0, \uac01 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \uac01\uae30 \ub2e4\ub978 \uc120\ud638 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \ubd80\uc5ec\ud558\uc5ec \uaca9\uc790 \uc138\uacc4 \ub0b4\ube44\uac8c\uc774\uc158 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ubaa9\ud45c \ud615\uc131\uc774 \uc804\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd5c\uace0\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uba70(\uc989, \ud65c\uc6a9 \ucd09\uc9c4), \ud658\uacbd\uc758 \uc804\uc774 \uc5ed\ud559\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud76c\uc0dd\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4(\uc989, \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ubc29\ud574).", "conclusion": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ud615\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uacfc \ud65c\uc6a9 \uc0ac\uc774\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce5c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc801\uadf9\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc740 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ud559\uc2b5 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc801 \ubc0f \ud65c\uc6a9\uc801 \ub3d9\uae30\ub97c \uc801\uc808\ud788 \uade0\ud615 \uc7a1\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uacc4\ud68d \ubc0f \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c\uc11c \uc608\uc0c1 \uc790\uc720 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud65c\uc6a9\uc801 \ub3d9\uae30\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ubb34\uc5c7\uc744 \uc131\ucde8\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud558\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uac01 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub418\ub294 \ubcc0\ubcc4\uc801 \ud655\ub960 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc640 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0\uac8c \ub354 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \ub192\uc740 \uc0c1\ud0dc \ub610\ub294 \uad00\uce21\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\ub294 \uc120\ud638 \ud655\ub960 \ubd84\ud3ec \uac04\uc758 \ucfe8\ubc31-\ub77c\uc774\ube14\ub7ec \ubc1c\uc0b0\uc73c\ub85c \ud615\uc2dd\ud654\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubb38\ud5cc\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc120\ud638 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc815\uc758\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294\uc9c0\uc640 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc815\uc758\uac00 \uc801\uadf9\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uac70\uc758 \uc8fc\ubaa9\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0\uac8c \uacbd\uc9c1\ub41c \ub610\ub294 \uc720\uc5f0\ud55c \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0 \ubaa9\ud45c \ud615\uc131(\uc989, \uc911\uac04 \ubaa9\ud45c)\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c \uc120\ud638 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \uc815\uc758\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac01\uae30 \ub2e4\ub978 \uc120\ud638 \ubd84\ud3ec\uac00 \uc124\uc815\ub41c \ub124 \uba85\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uaca9\uc790 \uc138\uacc4 \ub0b4\ube44\uac8c\uc774\uc158 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ube44\uad50\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ubaa9\ud45c \ud615\uc131\uc774 \uc804\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd5c\uace0\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\uba70(\uc989, \ud65c\uc6a9\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4), \ud658\uacbd\uc758 \uc804\uc774 \uc5ed\ud559\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud76c\uc0dd\ud568\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4(\uc989, \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \ubc29\ud574\ud568)."}}

LLMs are also deployed as multi-agent teams to assist AI doctors by debating, voting, or advising on decisions. However, when multiple assistant agents interact, coordinated adversaries can collude to create false consensus, pushing an AI doctor toward harmful prescriptions. We develop an experimental framework with scripted and unscripted doctor agents, adversarial assistants, and a verifier agent that checks decisions against clinical guidelines. Using 50 representative clinical questions, we find that collusion drives the Attack Success Rate (ASR) and Harmful Recommendation Rates (HRR) up to 100% in unprotected systems. In contrast, the verifier agent restores 100% accuracy by blocking adversarial consensus. This work provides the first systematic evidence of collusion risk in AI healthcare and demonstrates a practical, lightweight defence that ensures guideline fidelity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 AI \uc758\ub8cc \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc74c\ubaa8 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0, \uc784\uc0c1 \uc9c0\uce68 \uc900\uc218\ub97c \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\uc5b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \ud5ec\uc2a4\ucf00\uc5b4 IoT \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ud1b5\ud569\uc740 \ube60\ub978 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uba70 \uac1c\uc120\ub41c \uc758\ub8cc \uc9c0\uc6d0\uc744 \uc57d\uc18d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc2a4\ud06c\ub9bd\ud2b8 \ubc0f \ube44\uc2a4\ud06c\ub9bd\ud2b8 \uc758\uc0ac \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8, \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ubcf4\uc870 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8, \uc784\uc0c1 \uc9c0\uce68\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uac80\ud1a0\ud558\ub294 \uac80\uc99d \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "50\uac1c\uc758 \ub300\ud45c\uc801\uc778 \uc784\uc0c1 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, \uc74c\ubaa8\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc131\uacf5\ub960(ASR)\uacfc \ud574\ub85c\uc6b4 \ucd94\ucc9c\ub960(HRR)\uc774 \ubcf4\ud638\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ub300 100%\ub85c \uc99d\uac00\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uac80\uc99d \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc801\ub300\uc801\uc778 \ud569\uc758\ub97c \ucc28\ub2e8\ud558\uc5ec 100% \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ubcf5\uc6d0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 AI \uc758\ub8cc \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc74c\ubaa8 \uc704\ud5d8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \uc99d\uac70\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0, \uc9c0\uce68 \ucda9\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uacbd\ub7c9 \ubc29\uc5b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc758 \ud5ec\uc2a4\ucf00\uc5b4 IoT \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ud1b5\ud569\uc740 \ub354 \ube60\ub978 \uacb0\uc815\uacfc \uac1c\uc120\ub41c \uc758\ub8cc \uc9c0\uc6d0\uc744 \uc57d\uc18d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, these adaptation components are tightly coupled to a specific base model, making them difficult to reuse when the base model is upgraded (e.g., from SD 1.x to 2.x) due to substantial changes in model parameters and architecture. In this work, we propose Delta Sampling (DS), a novel method that enables knowledge transfer across base models with different architectures, without requiring access to the original training data. DS operates entirely at inference time by leveraging the delta: the difference in model predictions before and after the adaptation of a base model. This delta is then used to guide the denoising process of a new base model. We evaluate DS across various SD versions, demonstrating that DS achieves consistent improvements in creating desired effects (e.g., visual styles, semantic concepts, and structures) under different sampling strategies. These results highlight DS as an effective, plug-and-play mechanism for knowledge transfer in diffusion-based image synthesis.

These interactions represent a critical frontier for LLM-based agents, yet existing evaluation methods fail to measure how well these capabilities generalize to novel social situations. In this paper, we introduce a method for evaluating the ability of LLM-based agents to cooperate in zero-shot, mixed-motive environments using Concordia, a natural language multi-agent simulation environment. Our method measures general cooperative intelligence by testing an agent's ability to identify and exploit opportunities for mutual gain across diverse partners and contexts. We present empirical results from the NeurIPS 2024 Concordia Contest, where agents were evaluated on their ability to achieve mutual gains across a suite of diverse scenarios ranging from negotiation to collective action problems. Our findings reveal significant gaps between current agent capabilities and the robust generalization required for reliable cooperation, particularly in scenarios demanding persuasion and norm enforcement.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7 \ud63c\ud569 \ub3d9\uae30 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ud611\ub825\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874 \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub2a5\ub825\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \uce21\uc815\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "Concordia\ub77c\ub294 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud611\ub825 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "NeurIPS 2024 Concordia Contest\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc774\uc775\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubc1c\ud45c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ud604\uc7ac \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ub2a5\ub825\uacfc \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud611\ub825\uc5d0 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uc0ac\uc774\uc5d0 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uaca9\ucc28\uac00 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uc778\uac04 \ubc0f \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ubc30\uce58\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc740 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ucd5c\uc804\uc120\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0 \uc5bc\ub9c8\ub098 \uc798 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub418\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uce21\uc815\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ud658\uacbd\uc778 Concordia\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7 \ud63c\ud569 \ub3d9\uae30 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud611\ub825 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud30c\ud2b8\ub108\uc640 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c1\ud638 \uc774\uc775\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uae30\ud68c\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ud558\uc5ec \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ud611\ub825 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc744 \uce21\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud611\uc0c1\ubd80\ud130 \uc9d1\ub2e8 \ud589\ub3d9 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc774\ub974\uae30\uae4c\uc9c0 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc774\uc775\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c NeurIPS 2024 Concordia Contest\uc758 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc1c\uacac\uc740 \ud2b9\ud788 \uc124\ub4dd\uacfc \uaddc\ubc94 \uc9d1\ud589\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \ud604\uc7ac \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ub2a5\ub825\uacfc \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud611\ub825\uc5d0 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uc0ac\uc774\uc5d0 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uaca9\ucc28\uac00 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubc1d\ud600\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

These attacks involve carefully crafted prompts that bypass safety guardrails and induce models to produce harmful content. Detecting such malicious input queries is therefore critical for maintaining LLM safety. Existing methods for jailbreak detection typically involve fine-tuning LLMs as static safety LLMs using fixed training datasets. However, these methods incur substantial computational costs when updating model parameters to improve robustness, especially in the face of novel jailbreak attacks. Inspired by immunological memory mechanisms, we propose the Multi-Agent Adaptive Guard (MAAG) framework for jailbreak detection. The core idea is to equip guard with memory capabilities: upon encountering novel jailbreak attacks, the system memorizes attack patterns, enabling it to rapidly and accurately identify similar threats in future encounters. Specifically, MAAG first extracts activation values from input prompts and compares them to historical activations stored in a memory bank for quick preliminary detection. A defense agent then simulates responses based on these detection results, and an auxiliary agent supervises the simulation process to provide secondary filtering of the detection outcomes. Extensive experiments across five open-source models demonstrate that MAAG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, achieving 98% detection accuracy and a 96% F1-score across a diverse range of attack scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uac00\ub4dc(MAAG) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c

However, optimizing EB charging schedules to minimize operational costs while ensuring safe operation without battery depletion remains challenging - especially under real-world conditions, where uncertainties in PV generation, dynamic electricity prices, variable travel times, and limited charging infrastructure must be accounted for. In this paper, we propose a safe Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning (HDRL) framework for solving the EB Charging Scheduling Problem (EBCSP) under multi-source uncertainties. We formulate the problem as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) with options to enable temporally abstract decision-making. We develop a novel HDRL algorithm, namely Double Actor-Critic Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization Lagrangian (DAC-MAPPO-Lagrangian), which integrates Lagrangian relaxation into the Double Actor-Critic (DAC) framework. At the high level, we adopt a centralized PPO-Lagrangian algorithm to learn safe charger allocation policies. At the low level, we incorporate MAPPO-Lagrangian to learn decentralized charging power decisions under the Centralized Training and Decentralized Execution (CTDE) paradigm. Extensive experiments with real-world data demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing baselines in both cost minimization and safety compliance, while maintaining fast convergence speed.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc18c\uc2a4 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uc804\uae30 \ubc84\uc2a4 \ucda9\uc804 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc548\uc804\ud55c \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc2ec\uce35 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc804\uae30 \ubc84\uc2a4\uc640 \ud0dc\uc591\uad11 \ud328\ub110\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc7ac\uc0dd \uac00\ub2a5 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0\uc6d0\uc758 \ud1b5\ud569\uc740 \uc9c0\uc18d \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uc800\ud0c4\uc18c \ub300\uc911 \uad50\ud1b5 \uc218\ub2e8\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\ub294 \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc81c\uc57d \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815(CMDP)\uc73c\ub85c \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uace0, Lagrangian \uc644\ud654\ub97c Double Actor-Critic \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 HDRL \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 DAC-MAPPO-Lagrangian\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uc911\uc2dd PPO-Lagrangian \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \ucda9\uc804\uae30 \ud560\ub2f9 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uace0, MAPPO-Lagrangian\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uc911\uc2dd \ud6c8\ub828 \ubc0f \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc2e4\ud589(CTDE) \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd84\uc0b0 \ucda9\uc804 \uc804\ub825 \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uae30\uc874 \uae30\uc900\uc120\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ube44\uc6a9 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654 \ubc0f \uc548\uc804 \uc900\uc218\uc5d0\uc11c \ub354 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70 \ube60\ub978 \uc218\ub834 \uc18d\ub3c4\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud568\uc744 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc785\uc99d\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc7ac\uc0dd \uac00\ub2a5 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0\uc6d0\uacfc \uc804\uae30 \ubc84\uc2a4\uc758 \ud1b5\ud569\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \ucda9\uc804 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\ub9c1 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc9c0\uc18d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub300\uc911 \uad50\ud1b5\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uae30\uc5ec\ud560 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc804\uae30 \ubc84\uc2a4(EB)\uc640 \ud0dc\uc591\uad11(PV) \ud328\ub110\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc7ac\uc0dd \uac00\ub2a5 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0\uc6d0\uc758 \ud1b5\ud569\uc740 \uc9c0\uc18d \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uc800\ud0c4\uc18c \ub300\uc911 \uad50\ud1b5\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\ub294 \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc6b4\uc601 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc548\uc804\ud55c \uc6b4\uc601\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uace0 \ubc30\ud130\ub9ac \uace0\uac08\uc744 \ud53c\ud558\ub294 EB \ucda9\uc804 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub294 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc778 \uacfc\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788 PV \uc0dd\uc131\uc758 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131, \ub3d9\uc801 \uc804\uae30 \uc694\uae08, \ubcc0\ub3d9\ud558\ub294 \uc5ec\ud589 \uc2dc\uac04 \ubc0f \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ucda9\uc804 \uc778\ud504\ub77c\uac00 \uace0\ub824\ub418\uc5b4\uc57c \ud558\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc870\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c \uadf8\ub807\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc18c\uc2a4 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c EB \ucda9\uc804 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\ub9c1 \ubb38\uc81c(EBCSP)\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc548\uc804\ud55c \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc2ec\uce35 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(HDRL) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc2dc\uac04\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654\ub41c \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uc635\uc158\uc744 \uac16\ucd98 \uc81c\uc57d \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815(CMDP)\uc73c\ub85c \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

We present a novel framework that combines AWS Strands Agents with Thompson Sampling contextual bandits to enable AI agents to learn optimal decision-making strategies from user feedback alone. Our system optimizes three key dimensions: generation strategy selection (direct vs. chain-of-thought), tool selection (literature search, drug databases, etc.), and domain routing (pharmacology, molecular biology, clinical specialists). Through empirical evaluation on life science queries, we demonstrate 15-30\\% improvement in user satisfaction compared to random baselines, with clear learning patterns emerging after 20-30 queries. Our approach requires no ground truth labels, adapts continuously to user preferences, and provides a principled solution to the exploration-exploitation dilemma in agentic AI systems.", "AI":

Richer rewards computed from the reasoning tokens can improve learning significantly by providing more fine-grained guidance. However, it is challenging to compute more informative rewards in MMRL beyond those based on outcomes since different samples may require different scoring functions and teacher models may provide noisy reward signals too. In this paper, we introduce the Argos (Agentic Reward for Grounded & Objective Scoring), a principled reward agent to train multimodal reasoning models for agentic tasks. For each sample, Argos selects from a pool of teacher-model derived and rule-based scoring functions to simultaneously evaluate: (i) final response accuracy, (ii) spatiotemporal localization of referred entities and actions, and (iii) the quality of the reasoning process. We find that by leveraging our agentic verifier across both SFT data curation and RL training, our model achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple agentic tasks such as spatial reasoning, visual hallucination as well as robotics and embodied AI benchmarks. Critically, we demonstrate that just relying on SFT post-training on highly curated reasoning data is insufficient, as agents invariably collapse to ungrounded solutions during RL without our online verification. We also show that our agentic verifier can help to reduce reward-hacking in MMRL. Finally, we also provide a theoretical justification for the effectiveness of Argos through the concept of pareto-optimality.", "AI": {"tldr": "MMRL\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ucd5c\uc885 \ub2f5\ubcc0\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \ud76c\uc18c \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc138\ubc00\ud55c \uac00\uc774\ub4dc\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc6d0\uce59\uc801\uc778 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc778 Argos\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "MMRL\uc758 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\uc810\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uad6c\ucd95", "method": "Argos\ub294 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub2f9 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uac00\uc9c0 \uc810\uc218 \ud568\uc218 \uc911\uc5d0\uc11c \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\uc5ec \ucd5c\uc885 \uc751\ub2f5 \uc815\ud655\uc131, \uc2dc\uac04 \ubc0f \uacf5\uac04\uc801 \uc704\uce58, \ucd94\ub860 \uacfc\uc815\uc758 \uc9c8\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "Argos\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uae30\ub85d\ud588\uc73c\uba70, RL \ud6c8\ub828 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uac80\uc99d\uc774 \uc5c6\uc73c\uba74 \ub300\uac1c \ube44\uae30\ubc18 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc73c\ub85c \ubd95\uad34\ub418\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Argos\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud30c\ub808\ud1a0 \ucd5c\uc801\uc131\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\ub2f9\ud654\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(MMRL)\uc73c\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uc740 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uac15\ub825\ud574\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ucd5c\uc885 \ub2f5\ubcc0\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \ud76c\uc18c\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc \uae30\ubc18 \ubcf4\uc0c1\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ucd94\ub860 \ud1a0\ud070\uc5d0\uc11c \uacc4\uc0b0\ub41c \ub354\uc6b1 \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc740 \ub354 \uc138\ubc00\ud55c \uac00\uc774\ub4dc\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc720\uc775\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 MMRL\uc5d0\uc11c \uacc4\uc0b0\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc5b4\ub835\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc6d0\uce59\uc801\uc778 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc778 Argos(Agentic Reward for Grounded & Objective Scoring)\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.

However, the openness of the wireless medium and the intrinsic vulnerability of semantic latent representations expose such systems to previously unrecognized security risks. In this paper, we uncover a fundamental latent-space vulnerability that enables Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacker to covertly manipulate the transmitted semantics while preserving the statistical properties of the transmitted latent representations. We first present a Diffusion-based Re-encoding Attack (DiR), wherein the attacker employs a diffusion model to synthesize an attacker-designed semantic variant, and re-encodes it into a valid latent representation compatible with the SemCom decoder. Beyond this model-dependent pathway, we further propose a model-agnostic and training-free Test-Time Adaptation Latent Manipulation attack (TTA-LM), in which the attacker perturbs and steers the intercepted latent representation toward an attacker-specified semantic target by leveraging the gradient of a target loss function. In contrast to diffusion-based manipulation, TTA-LM does not rely on any generative model and does not impose modality-specific or task-specific assumptions, thereby enabling efficient and broadly applicable latent-space tampering across diverse SemCom architectures. Extensive experiments on representative semantic communication architectures demonstrate that both attacks can significantly alter the decoded semantics while preserving natural latent-space distributions, making the attacks covert and difficult to detect.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8 \uae30\ubc18 \ud1b5\uc2e0(SemCom)\uc740 \uc791\uc5c5 \uad00\ub828

However, in most real-world scenarios, lossy communication is a prevalent issue. Existing multi-agent reinforcement learning with communication, due to their limited scalability and robustness, struggles to apply to complex and dynamic real-world environments. To address these challenges, we propose a generalized communication-constrained model to uniformly characterize communication conditions across different scenarios. Based on this, we utilize it as a learning prior to distinguish between lossy and lossless messages for specific scenarios. Additionally, we decouple the impact of lossy and lossless messages on distributed decision-making, drawing on a dual mutual information estimatior, and introduce a communication-constrained multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, quantifying the impact of communication messages into the global reward. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our approach across several communication-constrained benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud611\ub825\uc801 \uc815\ucc45 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc218\ub2e8\uc784\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70, \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc190\uc2e4 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8f0 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2e4\uc81c \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc190\uc2e4 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0, \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud558\uace0 \ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud568.", "method": "\uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub41c \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc81c\uc57d \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5 \uc0ac\uc804\uc73c\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc190\uc2e4 \ubc0f \ubb34\uc190\uc2e4 \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0\ub97c \uad6c\ubcc4\ud558\uba70, \uc774\uc911 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc815\ubcf4 \ucd94\uc815\uae30\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubd84\ub9ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ud55c \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc81c\uc57d \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc81c\uc57d \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc784\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc2e4\uc81c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud611\ub825 \uc815\ucc45 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc218\ub2e8 \uc911 \ud558\ub098\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc190\uc2e4 \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc774 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ubb38\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \ud55c\uc815\ub41c \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uacfc \uacac\uace0\uc131 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud558\uace0 \ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \uc2e4\uc81c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc870\uac74\uc744 \uade0\uc77c\ud558\uac8c \ud2b9\uc131\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub41c \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc81c\uc57d \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc190\uc2e4 \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0\uc640 \ubb34\uc190\uc2e4 \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0\ub97c \uad6c\ubcc4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud559\uc2b5 \uc0ac\uc804\uc73c\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc774\uc911 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc815\ubcf4 \ucd94\uc815\uae30\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc190\uc2e4 \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0\uc640 \ubb34\uc190\uc2e4 \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0\uac00 \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\uace0, \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0\uac00 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud55c \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc81c\uc57d \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc81c\uc57d \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uac80\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, applying them to arbitrary functions (especially internal functions) \\textit{at scale} remains challenging due to the requirement of sophisticated contextual information, such as specification, dependencies, and usage examples. State-of-the-art methods heavily rely on static or incomplete context provisioning, causing failure of generating functional harnesses. Furthermore, LLMs tend to exploit harness validation metrics, producing plausible yet logically useless code. % Therefore, harness generation across large and diverse projects continues to face challenges in reliable compilation, robust code retrieval, and comprehensive validation.\n  To address these challenges, we present HarnessAgent, a tool-augmented agentic framework that achieves fully automated, scalable harness construction over hundreds of OSS-Fuzz targets. HarnessAgent introduces three key innovations: 1) a rule-based strategy to identify and minimize various compilation errors; 2) a hybrid tool pool for precise and robust symbol source code retrieval; and 3) an enhanced harness validation pipeline that detects fake definitions. We evaluate HarnessAgent on 243 target functions from OSS-Fuzz projects (65 C projects and 178 C++ projects). It improves the three-shot success rate by approximately 20\\% compared to state-of-the-art techniques, reaching 87\\% for C and 81\\% for C++. Our one-hour fuzzing results show that more than 75\\% of the harnesses generated by HarnessAgent increase the target function coverage, surpassing the baselines by over 10\\%. In addition, the hybrid tool-pool system of HarnessAgent achieves a response rate of over 90\\% for source code retrieval, outperforming Fuzz Introspector by more than 30\\%.", "AI": {"tldr": "HarnessAgent\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub418\uace0 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8 \ud37c\uc9d5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ucf54\ub4dc \ud558\ub124\uc2a4 \uc0dd\uc131 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub85c, OSS-Fuzz\uc758 \uc218\ubc31 \uac1c \ud0c0\uac9f\uc5d0\uc11c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uae30\uc874 \uae30\uc220\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 20% \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \ucf54\ub4dc \uac80\uc0c9 \ubc0f \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uae30\uc220\uc774 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc694\uad6c\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ub0b4\ubd80 \ud568\uc218\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \ud37c\uc9d5\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \ub192\uc740 \ud558\ub124\uc2a4 \uc0dd\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "HarnessAgent\ub294 \uaddc\uce59 \uae30\ubc18 \uc804\ub7b5, \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \ub3c4\uad6c \ud480, \uac1c\uc120\ub41c \ud558\ub124\uc2a4 \uac80\uc99d \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ud558\ub124\uc2a4 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "HarnessAgent\ub294 243\uac1c \ud0c0\uac9f \ud568\uc218\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \uae30\uc220\ubcf4\ub2e4 20% \uc774\uc0c1 \uac1c\uc120\ub41c \uc131\uacf5\ub960(87% C, 81% C++)\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc73c\uba70, 75% \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \ud558\ub124\uc2a4\uac00 \ubaa9\ud45c \ud568\uc218 \ucee4\ubc84\ub9ac\uc9c0\ub97c \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ucf30\uace0, \ub9ac\uc2a4\ud3f0\uc2a4 \ube44\uc728\uc740 90%\ub97c \ucd08\uacfc\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ucf54\ub4dc \uac80\uc0c9\uacfc \uac80\uc99d\uc5d0\uc11c \ud68d\uae30\uc801\uc778 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud504\ub85c\uc81d\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc778\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uae30\ubc18 \uae30\uc220\uc740 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8 \ud37c\uc9d5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud558\ub124\uc2a4\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc9c4\uc804\uc744 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub4e4\uc744 \uc784\uc758\uc758 \ud568\uc218(\ud2b9\ud788 \ub0b4\ubd80 \ud568\uc218)\uc5d0 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8\ub85c \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc0ac\uc591, \uc758\uc874\uc131 \ubc0f \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uc608\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc815\uad50\ud55c \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc694\uad6c\ud558\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uc2e0 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc815\uc801 \ub610\ub294 \ubd88\uc644\uc804\ud55c \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc81c\uacf5\uc5d0 \ud06c\uac8c \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\ub2a5 \ud558\ub124\uc2a4\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc2e4\ud328\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub354\uc6b1\uc774, LLM\uc740 \ud558\ub124\uc2a4 \uac80\uc99d \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc2a4\ub97c \uc545\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc788\uc5b4 \uadf8\ub7f4\ub4ef\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\uc6a9\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ucf54\ub4dc\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc218\ubc31 \uac1c\uc758 OSS-Fuzz \ud0c0\uac9f\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc644\uc804 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub418\uace0 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud558\ub124\uc2a4 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub3c4\uad6c \ubcf4\uac15 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 HarnessAgent\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

We introduce ATHENA (Agentic Team for Hierarchical Evolutionary Numerical Algorithms), an agentic framework designed as an Autonomous Lab to manage the end-to-end computational research lifecycle. Its core is the HENA loop, a knowledge-driven diagnostic process framed as a Contextual Bandit problem. Acting as an online learner, the system analyzes prior trials to select structural `actions' ($A_n$) from combinatorial spaces guided by expert blueprints (e.g., Universal Approximation, Physics-Informed constraints). These actions are translated into executable code ($S_n$) to generate scientific rewards ($R_n$). ATHENA transcends standard automation: in SciC, it autonomously identifies mathematical symmetries for exact analytical solutions or derives stable numerical solvers where foundation models fail. In SciML, it performs deep diagnosis to tackle ill-posed formulations and combines hybrid symbolic-numeric workflows (e.g., coupling PINNs with FEM) to resolve multiphysics problems.

PARC is built on a hierarchical multi-agent architecture incorporating task planning, execution, and a mechanism that evaluates its own actions and their outcomes from an independent context and provides feedback, namely self-assessment and self-feedback. This design enables PARC to detect and correct high-level strategic errors and sustain progress without human intervention. We evaluate PARC across computational science and data science tasks. In materials science, it autonomously reproduces key results from studies on lithium-ion conduction and alloy segregation. In particular, it coordinates dozens of parallel simulation tasks, each requiring roughly 43 hours of computation, managing orchestration, monitoring, and error correction end-to-end. In Kaggle-based experiments, starting from minimal natural-language instructions, PARC conducts data analysis and implements search strategies, producing solutions competitive with human-engineered baselines.

To evaluate the success of their trajectories, researchers have developed verifiers, such as LLM judges and process-reward models, to score the quality of each action in an agent's trajectory. Although these heuristic scores can be informative, there are no guarantees of correctness when used to decide whether an agent will yield a successful output. Here, we introduce e-valuator, a method to convert any black-box verifier score into a decision rule with provable control of false alarm rates. We frame the problem of distinguishing successful trajectories (that is, a sequence of actions that will lead to a correct response to the user's prompt) and unsuccessful trajectories as a sequential hypothesis testing problem. E-valuator builds on tools from e-processes to develop a sequential hypothesis test that remains statistically valid at every step of an agent's trajectory, enabling online monitoring of agents over arbitrarily long sequences of actions. Empirically, we demonstrate that e-valuator provides greater statistical power and better false alarm rate control than other strategies across six datasets and three agents. We additionally show that e-valuator can be used for to quickly terminate problematic trajectories and save tokens.

Drawing on Kripke semantics, we introduce specialized neurons for the modal operators $\\Box$ and $\\Diamond$ that operate over a set of possible worlds, enabling the framework to act as a differentiable ``logical guardrail.'' The architecture is highly flexible: the accessibility relation between worlds can either be fixed by the user to enforce known rules or, as an inductive feature, be parameterized by a neural network. This allows the model to optionally learn the relational structure of a logical system from data while simultaneously performing deductive reasoning within that structure.\n  This versatile construction is designed for flexibility. The entire framework is differentiable from end to end, with learning driven by minimizing a logical contradiction loss. This not only makes the system resilient to inconsistent knowledge but also enables it to learn nonlinear relationships that can help define the logic of a problem space. We illustrate MLNNs on four case studies: grammatical guardrailing, axiomatic detection of the unknown, multi-agent epistemic trust, and detecting constructive deception in natural language negotiation.

This struggle is driven by two main limitations. First, single-agent architectures enforce a monolithic plan-execute loop, which directly causes trajectory instability. Second, the requirement to use local open-weight models for data privacy introduces smaller context windows leading to the rapid consumption of context from large tool outputs. To solve this problem we introduce RP-ReAct (Reasoner Planner-ReAct), a novel multi-agent approach that fundamentally decouples strategic planning from low-level execution to achieve superior reliability and efficiency. RP-ReAct consists of a Reasoner Planner Agent (RPA), responsible for planning each sub-step, continuously analysing the execution results using the strong reasoning capabilities of a Large Reasoning Model, and one or multiple Proxy-Execution Agent (PEA) that translates sub-steps into concrete tool interactions using a ReAct approach. Crucially, we incorporate a context-saving strategy within the PEA to mitigate context window overflow by managing large tool outputs via external storage and on-demand access. We evaluate RP-ReAct, on the challenging, multi-domain ToolQA benchmark using a diverse set of six open-weight reasoning models. Our empirical results show that RP-ReAct achieves superior performance and improved generalization ability over state-of-the-art baselines when addressing diverse complex tasks across the evaluated domains.

Current approaches to agent programming often entangle two aspects of agent design: the core workflow logic and the inference-time strategy (e.g., tree search). We introduce \"probabilistic angelic nondeterminism\" (\"PAN\"), a programming model that disentangles these two concerns, allowing the programmer to describe the agent workflow and independently experiment with different inference-time strategies by simply changing a few inputs. We provide an implementation of PAN in Python as the EnCompass framework, which uses a Python decorator to compile agent workflow programs into a search space. We present three case studies that demonstrate how the framework lets the programmer quickly improve the reliability of an agent and easily switch between different inference-time strategies, all with little additional coding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc124\uacc4\uc758 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uce21\uba74\uc778 \ud575\uc2ec \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0 \ub17c\ub9ac\uc640 \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc5bd\ud788\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4e0\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 '\ud655\ub960\uc801 \ucc9c\uc0ac \ube44\uacb0\uc815\ub860'(PAN)\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\uba38\uac00 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub97c \uc124\uba85\ud558\uace0 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2e4\ud5d8\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "Python\uc5d0\uc11c PAN\uc744 \uad6c\ud604\ud55c EnCompass \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc744 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uacf5\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \ucef4\ud30c\uc77c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 Python \ub370\ucf54\ub808\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc0ac\ub840 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\uba38\uac00 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \uc2e0\uc18d\ud558\uac8c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc804\ub7b5 \uac04\uc5d0 \uc27d\uac8c \uc804\ud658\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ub3d5\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud604\uc7ac \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc124\uacc4\uc758 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uce21\uba74\uc778 \ud575\uc2ec \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0 \ub17c\ub9ac\uc640 \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc804\ub7b5(\uc608: \ud2b8\ub9ac \uac80\uc0c9)\uc744 \uc5bd\ud788\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4ed\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 '\ud655\ub960\uc801 \ucc9c\uc0ac \ube44\uacb0\uc815\ub860'('PAN')\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\uace0, \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\uba38\uac00 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub97c \uc124\uba85\ud558\uace0 \uba87 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc785\ub825\uc744 \ubc14\uafb8\ub294 \uac83\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2e4\ud5d8\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Python\uc5d0\uc11c PAN\uc744 \uad6c\ud604\ud55c EnCompass \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 Python \ub370\ucf54\ub808\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc744 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uacf5\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \ucef4\ud30c\uc77c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\uba38\uac00 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \uc2e0\uc18d\ud558\uac8c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0, \uc801\uc740 \ucd94\uac00 \ucf54\ub529\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc804\ub7b5 \uac04\uc5d0 \uc27d\uac8c \uc804\ud658\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc0ac\ub840 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Addressing the systematic misalignment between existing theoretical models and real-world economic complexities, we identify three critical gaps: (1) data modality mismatch where unstructured textual sources (e.g. negotiation records, approval documents) impede accurate customer profiling; (2) dynamic feature entanglement challenges in modeling nonlinear price elasticity and time-varying attributes; (3) operational infeasibility caused by multi-tier business constraints.\n  Our framework introduces a tri-level architecture for above challenges. We design a hybrid knowledge fusion engine employing large language models (LLMs) for deep semantic parsing of unstructured text, transforming distributor agreements and sales assessments into structured features while integrating managerial expertise. Then a game-theoretic constrained optimization mechanism is employed to dynamically reconcile supply chain interests through bilateral utility functions, encoding manufacturer-distributor profit redistribution as endogenous objectives under hierarchical constraints. Finally an interpretable decision distillation interface leveraging LLM-guided symbolic regression to find and optimize pricing strategies and auditable business rules embeds economic priors (e.g. non-negative elasticity) as hard constraints during mathematical expression search. We validate the framework in real retail environments achieving higher profits versus systematic B2C baselines while ensuring operational feasibility.

Without reliable memory, agents catastrophically forget past experiences, struggle with long-horizon reasoning, and fail to operate coherently in multimodal or interactive environments. We introduce MemVerse, a model-agnostic, plug-and-play memory framework that bridges fast parametric recall with hierarchical retrieval-based memory, enabling scalable and adaptive multimodal intelligence. MemVerse maintains short-term memory for recent context while transforming raw multimodal experiences into structured long-term memories organized as hierarchical knowledge graphs. This design supports continual consolidation, adaptive forgetting, and bounded memory growth. To handle real-time demands, MemVerse introduces a periodic distillation mechanism that compresses essential knowledge from long-term memory into the parametric model, allowing fast, differentiable recall while preserving interpretability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MemVerse significantly improves multimodal reasoning and continual learning efficiency, empowering agents to remember, adapt, and reason coherently across extended interactions.", "AI": {"tldr": "MemVerse\ub294 \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \ube60\ub978 \uae30\uc5b5\uacfc \uc704\uacc4\uc801 \uac80\uc0c9 \uae30\ubc18 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\ub97c \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\uc5ec AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ub2e8\uae30 \uae30\uc5b5 \ubc0f \uacbd\ud5d8 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uae30\uc5b5\ub825\uc758 \ubd80\uc871\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\uad00\uc131 \uc788\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc218\ud589\uc744 \ubc29\ud574\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "MemVerse\ub294 \ub2e8\uae30 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc6d0\uc2dc \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \uacbd\ud5d8\uc744 \uc704\uacc4\uc801 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub294 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \uc694\uad6c\ub97c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc8fc\uae30\uc801\uc778 \uc99d\ub958 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc7a5\uae30 \uae30\uc5b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud544\uc218 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc555\ucd95\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc MemVerse\ub294 \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba70, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uae30\uc5b5\ud558\uace0 \uc801\uc751\ud558\uba70 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ucd94\ub860\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "MemVerse\ub294 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uae30\uc5b5\ud558\uace0, \uc801\uc751\ud558\uba70, \uc7a5\uae30\uc801\uc778 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ucd94\ub860\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud574\uc8fc\ub294 \ud575\uc2ec \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ube44\uc988\ub2c8\uc2a4 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubc0f \ube44\uc804 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ube60\ub978 \ubc1c\uc804\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0, AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uc81c\ud55c\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uacfc\uac70 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc744 \uae30\uc5b5\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4. \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uae30\uc5b5 \uc5c6\uc774, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uacfc\uac70 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc744 \uc7ac\uc559\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc78a\uc5b4\ubc84\ub9ac\uace0, \uc7a5\uae30\uc801\uc778 \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uc73c\uba70, \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \ub610\ub294 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ube60\ub978 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \uae30\uc5b5\uc744 \uc704\uacc4\uc801 \uac80\uc0c9 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uae30\uc5b5\uacfc \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\uc5ec \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uc801\uc751 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378 \ube44\ud2b9\uc815 \ud50c\ub7ec\uadf8 \uc564 \ud50c\ub808\uc774 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 MemVerse\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged and become a promising approach to achieving AHD, but current LLM-based AHD research often only considers a single role. This paper proposes RoCo, a novel Multi-Agent Role-Based System, to enhance the diversity and quality of AHD through multi-role collaboration. RoCo coordinates four specialized LLM-guided agents-explorer, exploiter, critic, and integrator-to collaboratively generate high-quality heuristics. The explorer promotes long-term potential through creative, diversity-driven thinking, while the exploiter focuses on short-term improvements via conservative, efficiency-oriented refinements. The critic evaluates the effectiveness of each evolution step and provides targeted feedback and reflection. The integrator synthesizes proposals from the explorer and exploiter, balancing innovation and exploitation to drive overall progress. These agents interact in a structured multi-round process involving feedback, refinement, and elite mutations guided by both short-term and accumulated long-term reflections. We evaluate RoCo on five different COPs under both white-box and black-box settings.

Classical aggregation rules assume euclidean topology and uniform communication reliability, limiting their suitability for emerging quantum federated systems. This paper introduces A2G (Adaptive Aggregation with Two Gains), a dual gain framework that jointly regulates geometric blending through a geometry gain and modulates client importance using a QoS gain derived from teleportation fidelity, latency, and instability. We develop the A2G update rule, establish convergence guarantees under smoothness and bounded variance assumptions, and show that A2G recovers FedAvg, QoS aware averaging, and manifold based aggregation as special cases.

This paper introduces the Static Deep Research Agent (Static-DRA), a novel solution built upon a configurable and hierarchical Tree-based static workflow.\n  The core contribution is the integration of two user-tunable parameters, Depth and Breadth, which provide granular control over the research intensity. This design allows end-users to consciously balance the desired quality and comprehensiveness of the research report against the associated computational cost of Large Language Model (LLM) interactions. The agent's architecture, comprising Supervisor, Independent, and Worker agents, facilitates effective multi-hop information retrieval and parallel sub-topic investigation.\n  We evaluate the Static-DRA against the established DeepResearch Bench using the RACE (Reference-based Adaptive Criteria-driven Evaluation) framework. Configured with a depth of 2 and a breadth of 5, and powered by the gemini-2.5-pro model, the agent achieved an overall score of 34.72. Our experiments validate that increasing the configured Depth and Breadth parameters results in a more in-depth research process and a correspondingly higher evaluation score.

Even an AI system that is perfectly aligned to the intentions of its operating organization can lead to bad outcomes if the goals of that organization are misaligned with those of other institutions and individuals. For this reason, we need full-stack alignment, the concurrent alignment of AI systems and the institutions that shape them with what people value. This can be done without imposing a particular vision of individual or collective flourishing. We argue that current approaches for representing values, such as utility functions, preference orderings, or unstructured text, struggle to address these and other issues effectively. They struggle to distinguish values from other signals, to support principled normative reasoning, and to model collective goods. We propose thick models of value will be needed. These structure the way values and norms are represented, enabling systems to distinguish enduring values from fleeting preferences, to model the social embedding of individual choices, and to reason normatively, applying values in new domains. We demonstrate this approach in five areas: AI value stewardship, normatively competent agents, win-win negotiation systems, meaning-preserving economic mechanisms, and democratic regulatory institutions.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uacfc \uc774\ub97c \ud615\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc81c\ub3c4\uc758 \ub3d9\uc2dc \uc815\ub82c\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uac1c\ubcc4 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc6b4\uc601\uc790\uc758 \uc758\ub3c4\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucd94\ub294 \uac83\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uc774\uc775\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub2e4.", "method": "\uac00\uce58\uc758 \ub450\uaebc\uc6b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uac00\uce58\uc640 \uc77c\uc2dc\uc801\uc778 \uc120\ud638\ub97c \uad6c\ubcc4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "AI \uac00\uce58 \uad00\ub9ac, \uaddc\ubc94\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\ub2a5\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8, \uc708-\uc708 \ud611\uc0c1 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ub4f1 5\uac00\uc9c0 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uac00\uce58\uc640 \uaddc\ubc94\uc744 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc6b4\uc601\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac1c\ubcc4 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc6b4\uc601\uc790\ub098 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc758\ub3c4\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucd94\ub294 \uac83\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \uc720\uc775\ud55c \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b4\uc601 \uc870\uc9c1\uc758 \uc758\ub3c4\uc5d0 \uc644\ubcbd\ud558\uac8c \uc815\ub82c\ub41c AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc870\ucc28\ub3c4, \uadf8 \uc870\uc9c1\uc758 \ubaa9\ud45c\uac00 \ub2e4\ub978 \uae30\uad00 \ubc0f \uac1c\uc778\uc758 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc640 \uc77c\uce58\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294\ub2e4\uba74 \ubd80\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc774\uc720\ub85c AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uacfc \uc774\ub97c \ud615\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc81c\ub3c4\ub97c \uc0ac\ub78c\ub4e4\uc774 \uac00\uce58 \uc788\uac8c \uc5ec\uae30\ub294 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc73c\ub85c \ub3d9\uc2dc \uc815\ub82c\ud558\ub294 '\ud480\uc2a4\ud0dd \uc815\ub82c'\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac1c\uc778\uc774\ub098 \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc758 \ubc88\uc601\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud2b9\uc815 \ube44\uc804\uc744 \uac15\uc694\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0\ub3c4 \uc774\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uac00\uce58 \ud45c\ud604 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc778 \ud6a8\uc6a9 \ud568\uc218, \uc120\ud638 \uc21c\uc704 \ub610\ub294 \ube44\uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub4e4\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub4e4\uc740 \uac00\uce58\ub97c \ub2e4\ub978 \uc2e0\ud638\uc640 \uad6c\ubcc4\ud558\uace0, \uc6d0\uce59 \uc788\ub294 \uaddc\ubc94\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uba70, \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc7ac\ub97c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac00\uce58\ub97c \ub450\uaecd\uac8c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uac00\uce58\uc640 \uaddc\ubc94\uc774 \ud45c\ud604\ub418\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uac00\uce58\uc640 \uc77c\uc2dc\uc801\uc778 \uc120\ud638\ub97c \uad6c\ubcc4\ud558\uace0 \uac1c\ubcc4 \uc120\ud0dd\uc758 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uba70, \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc601\uc5ed\uc5d0 \uac00\uce58\ub97c \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uaddc\ubc94\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\ub860\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 AI \uac00\uce58 \uad00\ub9ac, \uaddc\ubc94\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\ub2a5\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8, \uc708-\uc708 \ud611\uc0c1 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c, \uc758\ubbf8\ub97c \ubcf4\uc874\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc81c \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998 \ubc0f \ubbfc\uc8fc\uc801 \uaddc\uc81c \uae30\uad00 \ub4f1 5\uac1c \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

While prior work has primarily focused on ensuring compliance, our approach considers scenarios where deviating from policies may be necessary to achieve high-stakes goals. Additionally, modeling non-compliant behavior can assist policymakers by simulating realistic human decision-making. Our framework extends Gelfond and Lobo's Authorization and Obligation Policy Language (AOPL) to incorporate penalties and integrates Answer Set Programming (ASP) for reasoning. Compared to previous approaches, our method ensures well-formed policies, accounts for policy priorities, and enhances explainability by explicitly identifying rule violations and their consequences. Building on the work of Harders and Inclezan, we introduce penalty-based reasoning to distinguish between non-compliant plans, prioritizing those with minimal repercussions. To support this, we develop an automated translation from the extended AOPL into ASP and refine ASP-based planning algorithms to account for incurred penalties.

Under the standard LiNGAM assumptions of linearity, acyclicity, and exogeneity, we prove that the Gaussianity of the forward-model noise is equivalent to the independence between the regressor and residual in the reverse model. This theoretical insight allows us to replace fragile and sample-sensitive Gaussianity tests with robust kernel-based independence tests. Experimental results validate the equivalence and demonstrate that GaussDetect-LiNGAM maintains high consistency across diverse noise types and sample sizes, while reducing the number of tests per decision (TPD).

A single-agent implementation demonstrates the benchmark's applicability, establishing quantitative metrics for comparison of LLM-based planning and execution approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc0b0\uc5c5 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub294 \uc720\uc5f0\ud55c \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\uba70, \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc774\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ud45c\uc900\ud654\ub41c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 Blocksworld \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\ub294 \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uac00 \ud3c9\uac00\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d Model Context Protocol (MCP)\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc0b0\uc5c5 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcc0\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5\uacfc \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc720\uc5f0\ud55c \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc804\ub7b5\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131.", "method": "Blocksworld \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, Model Context Protocol (MCP)\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uac00 \ud45c\uc900\ud654\ub41c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0 \uc5f0\uacb0\ub418\uace0 \ud3c9\uac00\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud568.", "result": "\ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uad6c\ud604\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc758 \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uace0, \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18 \uacc4\ud68d \ubc0f \uc2e4\ud589 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ube44\uad50\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc815\ub7c9\uc801 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc744 \uc124\uc815\ud568.", "conclusion": "\ud45c\uc900\ud654\ub41c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc758 \ube44\uad50\uc640 \ud3c9\uac00\uac00 \uac00\ub2a5\ud574\uc9d0.", "translated_summary": "\uc0b0\uc5c5 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub294 \ubcc0\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5\uacfc \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc720\uc5f0\ud55c \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc801\uc751\uc801 \uacc4\ud68d \ubc0f \uc2e4\ud589\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \ube44\uad50\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud45c\uc900\ud654\ub41c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Blocksworld \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\ub294 \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \ub2e4\uc12f \uac1c\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131 \ubc94\uc8fc\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.

Rather than randomly varying, there are typically a small number of subtypes for how a disease progresses across patients. To capture this structured heterogeneity, the Subtype and Stage Inference Event-Based Model (SuStaIn) estimates the number of subtypes, the order of disease progression for each subtype, and assigns each patient to a subtype from primarily cross-sectional data. It has been widely applied to uncover the subtypes of many diseases and inform our understanding of them. But how robust is its performance? In this paper, we develop a principled Bayesian subtype variant of the event-based model (BEBMS) and compare its performance to SuStaIn in a variety of synthetic data experiments with varied levels of model misspecification. BEBMS substantially outperforms SuStaIn across ordering, staging, and subtype assignment tasks. Further, we apply BEBMS and SuStaIn to a real-world Alzheimer's data set. We find BEBMS has results that are more consistent with the scientific consensus of Alzheimer's disease progression than SuStaIn.", "AI": {"tldr": "BEBMS\ub294 SuStaIn\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub9cc\uc131 \uc9c8\ud658\uc740 \ud658\uc790\ub9c8\ub2e4 \uc9c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc815\uc774 \ub2e4\ub974\uac8c \uc9c4\ud589\ub418\ubbc0\ub85c \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc0ac\uac74 \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc6d0\ub9ac\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \ubca0\uc774esian \ud558\uc704 \uc720\ud615 \ubcc0\ud615 \ubaa8\ub378(BEBMS)\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uace0, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c SuStaIn\uacfc \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ube44\uad50\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "BEBMS\ub294 \uc21c\uc11c, \ub2e8\uacc4 \ubc0f \ud558\uc704 \uc720\ud615 \ud560\ub2f9 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c SuStaIn\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ub2a5\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "BEBMS\ub294 \uc54c\uce20\ud558\uc774\uba38 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud588\uc744 \ub54c SuStaIn\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub9cc\uc131 \uc9c8\ud658\uc740 \ud658\uc790\ub9c8\ub2e4 \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub974\uac8c \uc9c4\ud589\ub418\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubb34\uc791\uc704\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ub3d9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c, \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud658\uc790\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc9c8\ubcd1\uc774 \uc9c4\ud589\ub418\ub294 \ud558\uc704 \uc720\ud615\uc740 \uc18c\uc218\uc5d0 \ubd88\uacfc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \ud558\uc704 \uc720\ud615 \ubc0f \ub2e8\uacc4 \ucd94\ub860 \uc0ac\uac74 \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378(SuStaIn)\uc740 \ud558\uc704 \uc720\ud615\uc758 \uc218, \uac01 \ud558\uc704 \uc720\ud615\ubcc4 \uc9c8\ubcd1 \uc9c4\ud589\uc758 \uc21c\uc11c \ubc0f \uac01 \ud658\uc790\ub97c \uc8fc\ub85c \ub2e8\uba74 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \ud558\uc704 \uc720\ud615\uc5d0 \ud560\ub2f9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc9c8\ubcd1\uc758 \ud558\uc704 \uc720\ud615\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ud574\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub110\ub9ac \uc801\uc6a9\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uadf8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc5bc\ub9c8\ub098 \uacac\uace0\ud55c\uac00? \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc0ac\uac74 \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc6d0\uce59\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \ubca0\uc774esian \ud558\uc704 \uc720\ud615 \ubcc0\ud615 \ubaa8\ub378(BEBMS)\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uace0, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378 \ubbf8\uc2a4\uc2a4\ud399\ud53c\ucf00\uc774\uc158 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c SuStaIn\uacfc \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ube44\uad50\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

They are developed to provide criteria-based progression and standardize patient treatment, thereby improving care, reducing resource use, and accelerating patient recovery. However, manual modeling of these pathways based on clinical guidelines and domain expertise is difficult and may not reflect the actual best practices for different variations or combinations of diseases. We propose a two-phase modeling method using process mining, which extends the knowledge base of clinical pathways by leveraging conformance checking diagnostics. In the first phase, historical data of a given disease is collected to capture treatment in the form of a process model. In the second phase, new data is compared against the reference model to verify conformance. Based on the conformance checking results, the knowledge base can be expanded with more specific models tailored to new variants or disease combinations. We demonstrate our approach using Synthea, a benchmark dataset simulating patient treatments for SARS-CoV-2 infections with varying COVID-19 complications. The results show that our method enables expanding the knowledge base of clinical pathways with sufficient precision, peaking to 95.62% AUC while maintaining an arc-degree simplicity of 67.11%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc784\uc0c1 \uacbd\ub85c\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub450 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc758 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \ub9c8\uc774\ub2dd \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc784\uc0c1 \uacbd\ub85c\ub294 \ud658\uc790\uc758 \uce58\ub8cc \uc808\ucc28\ub97c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud55c \uc804\ubb38\ud654\ub41c \uc758\ub8cc \uacc4\ud68d\uc73c\ub85c, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud658\uc790 \uce58\ub8cc\ub97c \ud45c\uc900\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uc790\uc6d0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uba70 \ud68c\ubcf5\uc744 \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \ub9c8\uc774\ub2dd\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \ub450 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc218\uc9d1\ud558\uc5ec \uce58\ub8cc \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud615\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \ucea1\ucc98\ud558\uace0, \ub450 \ubc88\uc9f8 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uae30\uc900 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec \uc77c\uce58\uc131\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uae30\uc900 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc77c\uce58\uc131 \uac80\uc99d \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubcc0\uc885\uc774\ub098 \uc9c8\ubcd1 \uc870\ud569\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucd98 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc778 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c \uc9c0\uc2dd \ubca0\uc774\uc2a4\ub97c \ud655\uc7a5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 COVID-19 \ud569\ubcd1\uc99d\uc774 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c SARS-CoV-2 \uac10\uc5fc\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud658\uc790 \uce58\ub8cc\ub97c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud558\ub294 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc778 Synthea\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc785\uc99d\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, 95.62% AUC\uc758 \ucda9\ubd84\ud55c \uc815\ubc00\ub3c4\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c 67.11%\uc758 \ud638\uce6d \ub2e8\uc21c\uc131\uc744 \uae30\ub85d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc784\uc0c1 \uacbd\ub85c\ub294 \ud658\uc790 \uce58\ub8cc \uc808\ucc28\ub97c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud55c \uc804\ubb38\ud654\ub41c \uc758\ub8cc \uacc4\ud68d\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uae30\uc900 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc9c4\ud589\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0 \ud658\uc790 \uce58\ub8cc\ub97c \ud45c\uc900\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \ub3cc\ubd04\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0 \uc790\uc6d0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uba70 \ud658\uc790 \ud68c\ubcf5\uc744 \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uac1c\ubc1c\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc784\uc0c1 \uc9c0\uce68 \ubc0f \ubd84\uc57c \uc804\ubb38 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacbd\ub85c\uc758 \uc218\ub3d9 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc740 \uc5b4\ub835\uace0 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc9c8\ubcd1\uc758 \ubcc0\ud615\uc774\ub098 \uc870\ud569\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\uc81c \ucd5c\uc120\uc758 \uad00\ud589\uc744 \ubc18\uc601\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc21c\uc751\uc131 \uc810\uac80 \uc9c4\ub2e8\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc784\uc0c1 \uacbd\ub85c\uc758 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uae30\ubc18\uc744 \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \ub9c8\uc774\ub2dd\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c \ub450 \ub2e8\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc8fc\uc5b4\uc9c4 \uc9c8\ubcd1\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc218\uc9d1\ud558\uc5ec \uce58\ub8cc\ub97c \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud615\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \ucea1\ucc98\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub450 \ubc88\uc9f8 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uae30\uc900 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec \uc77c\uce58\uc131\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc77c\uce58\uc131 \uac80\uc99d \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubcc0\uc885\uc774\ub098 \uc9c8\ubcd1 \uc870\ud569\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucd98 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc778 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c \uc9c0\uc2dd \uae30\ubc18\uc744 \ud655\uc7a5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Numerous studies have leveraged the robustness of decision-making in Reinforcement Learning (RL) to address the optimization challenges in algorithm configuration. However, applying RL to DAC is challenging and often requires extensive domain expertise. We conduct a comprehensive study of deep-RL algorithms in DAC through a systematic analysis of controlling the population size parameter of the (1+($\u03bb$,$\u03bb$))-GA on OneMax instances. Our investigation of DDQN and PPO reveals two fundamental challenges that limit their effectiveness in DAC: scalability degradation and learning instability. We trace these issues to two primary causes: under-exploration and planning horizon coverage, each of which can be effectively addressed through targeted solutions. To address under-exploration, we introduce an adaptive reward shifting mechanism that leverages reward distribution statistics to enhance DDQN agent exploration, eliminating the need for instance-specific hyperparameter tuning and ensuring consistent effectiveness across different problem scales. In dealing with the planning horizon coverage problem, we demonstrate that undiscounted learning effectively resolves it in DDQN, while PPO faces fundamental variance issues that necessitate alternative algorithmic designs.

Previous efforts have primarily centered around studying more effective FSCIL approaches. By contrast, less attention was devoted to thinking the security issues in contributing to FSCIL. This paper aims to provide a holistic study of the impact of attacks on FSCIL. We first derive insights by systematically exploring how human expert-designed attack methods (i.e., PGD, FGSM) affect FSCIL. We find that those methods either fail to attack base classes, or suffer from huge labor costs due to relying on huge expert knowledge. This highlights the need to craft a specialized attack method for FSCIL. Grounded in these insights, in this paper, we propose a simple yet effective ACraft method to automatically steer and discover optimal attack methods targeted at FSCIL by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) without human experts. Moreover, to improve the reasoning between LLMs and FSCIL, we introduce a novel Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) based reinforcement learning to optimize learning, making LLMs generate better attack methods in the next generation by establishing positive feedback. Experiments on mainstream benchmarks show that our ACraft significantly degrades the performance of state-of-the-art FSCIL methods and dramatically beyond human expert-designed attack methods while maintaining the lowest costs of attack.", "AI": {"tldr": "FSCIL\uc740 \uc774\uc804 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \ud559\uc2b5\ud55c \ub0b4\uc6a9\uc744 \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\uba70 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4

Traditional numerical methods suffer from mesh-dependent errors and high computational costs, while classical Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) face bottlenecks in parameter efficiency, high-dimensional expression, and strong nonlinear fitting. To address these limitations, we propose a Discrete Variable (DV)-Circuit Quantum-Classical Physics-Informed Neural Network (QCPINN) and apply it to three typical reservoir seepage models for the first time: the pressure diffusion equation for heterogeneous single-phase flow, the nonlinear Buckley-Leverett (BL) equation for two-phase waterflooding, and the convection-diffusion equation for compositional flow considering adsorption. The QCPINN integrates classical preprocessing/postprocessing networks with a DV quantum core, leveraging quantum superposition and entanglement to enhance high-dimensional feature mapping while embedding physical constraints to ensure solution consistency. We test three quantum circuit topologies (Cascade, Cross-mesh, Alternate) and demonstrate through numerical experiments that QCPINNs achieve high prediction accuracy with fewer parameters than classical PINNs. Specifically, the Alternate topology outperforms others in heterogeneous single-phase flow and two-phase BL equation simulations, while the Cascade topology excels in compositional flow with convection-dispersion-adsorption coupling. Our work verifies the feasibility of QCPINN for reservoir engineering applications, bridging the gap between quantum computing research and industrial practice in oil and gas engineering.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc591\uc790-\uace0\uc804 \ubb3c\ub9ac \uc815\ubcf4 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(QCPINN)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc720\uccb4 \uce68\ud22c\uc758 \ubd80\ubd84 \ubbf8\ubd84 \ubc29\uc815\uc2dd\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0, \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uc5ec \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc720\uc804 \uce68\ud22c\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ubd80\ubd84 \ubbf8\ubd84 \ubc29\uc815\uc2dd(PDE) \ud574\uacb0\uc740 \uc11d\uc720 \ubc0f \uac00\uc2a4 \uc804\uac1c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc640 \uc0dd\uc0b0 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "QCPINN\uc740 \uace0\uc804\uc801\uc778 \uc804\ucc98\ub9ac/\ud6c4\ucc98\ub9ac \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc640 \uc774\uc0b0 \ubcc0\uc218 \uc591\uc790 \ud575\uc2ec\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc591\uc790 \uc911\ucca9\uacfc \uc5bd\ud798\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uace0, \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ub0b4\uc7ac\uc2dc\ucf1c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc591\uc790 \ud68c\ub85c \uad6c\uc870(Cascade, Cross-mesh, Alternate)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc218\uce58 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 QCPINN\uc774 \uace0\uc804\uc801 PINN\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc801\uc740 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub85c \ub192\uc740 \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud568\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 QCPINN\uc774 \uc720\uc804 \uacf5\ud559 \uc751\uc6a9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc591\uc790 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc640 \uc11d\uc720 \ubc0f \uac00\uc2a4 \uacf5\ud559\uc758 \uc0b0\uc5c5\uc801 \uc2e4\ucc9c \uac04\uc758 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uc18c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc800\uc218\uc9c0 \uce68\ud22c\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ubd80\ubd84 \ubbf8\ubd84 \ubc29\uc815\uc2dd(PDE)\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc11d\uc720 \ubc0f \uac00\uc2a4 \ubd84\uc57c \uac1c\ubc1c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc640 \uc0dd\uc0b0 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc218\uce58\uc801 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uba54\uc26c \uc758\uc874\uc801 \uc624\ub958\uc640 \ub192\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uace0\uc804 \ubb3c\ub9ac \uc815\ubcf4 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(PINNs)\uc740 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131, \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \ud45c\ud604, \uac15\ud55c \ube44\uc120\ud615 \uc801\ud569\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\uc0b0 \ubcc0\uc218(DV)-\ud68c\ub85c \uc591\uc790-\uace0\uc804 \ubb3c\ub9ac \uc815\ubcf4 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(QCPINN)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ub2e8\uc77c\uc0c1 \ud750\ub984\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc555\ub825 \ud655\uc0b0 \ubc29\uc815\uc2dd, \ub450\uc0c1\ud669 \uc218\uc870\uc758 \ube44\uc120\ud615 Buckley-Leverett(BL) \ubc29\uc815\uc2dd, \ud761\ucc29\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud55c \uc870\uc131 \ud750\ub984\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub300\ub958-\ud655\uc0b0 \ubc29\uc815\uc2dd\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc804\ud615\uc801\uc778 \uc800\uc218\uc9c0 \uce68\ud22c \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ucd5c\ucd08\ub85c \uc801\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, such policies are contextually dependent on factors such as user preferences or modality. For example, enumerating multiple possible user intentions is cumbersome on small screens or in a voice setting. In this work, we propose to train steerable policies for managing this uncertainty using self-play. Given two agents, one simulating a user and the other an AI assistant, we generate conversations where the user issues a potentially ambiguous query, and the assistant needs to determine how to respond. Importantly, the model takes as input the numerical cost of each clarification question, and each generated word, and is asked to take the action that will maximize its final reward, which is the cost-penalized accuracy. We use Reinforced Self-Training (ReST) to train our model to achieve high reward and show this leads to a steerable policy that changes its behavior predictably conditioned on the provided costs, leading to higher reward and accuracy. Moreover, our procedure also generalizes to numerical cost values that were unobserved at training time.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc870\uc815 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AI \uc5b4\uc2dc\uc2a4\ud134\ud2b8\uac00 \ubaa8\ud638\ud55c \ucffc\ub9ac\ub97c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \uc815\ucc45\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc790\uae30 \ud559\uc2b5(self-play)\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8(\uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ubc0f AI \uc5b4\uc2dc\uc2a4\ud134\ud2b8)\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \ub300\ud654\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 AI \uc5b4\uc2dc\uc2a4\ud134\ud2b8\uac00 \uc751\ub2f5 \ubc29\uc548\uc744 \uacb0\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ucd5c\uc885 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud6c8\ub828\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc81c\uacf5\ub41c \ube44\uc6a9\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc608\uce21 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubcc0\uacbd\ud558\ub294 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uba70, \ub192\uc740 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uacfc \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc9d1\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ubaa8\ud638\ud55c \ucffc\ub9ac\ub97c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 AI \uc5b4\uc2dc\uc2a4\ud134\ud2b8\ub294 (a) \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc758 \uc758\ub3c4\ub97c \ucd94\uce21\ud558\uace0 \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc751\ub2f5\ud560 \ub54c, (b) \uc5ec\ub7ec \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc758\ub3c4\ub97c \uc5f4\uac70\ud558\uace0 \uc751\ub2f5\ud560 \ub54c, (c) \uba85\ud655\ud55c \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \ud574\uc57c \ud560 \ub54c\ub97c \uacb0\uc815\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \uc815\ucc45\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc815\ucc45\uc740 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc120\ud638\ub3c4\ub098 \uc591\uc2dd\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ub2e4\ub985\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc608\ub97c \ub4e4\uc5b4, \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc758 \uc758\ub3c4\ub97c \ub098\uc5f4\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc791\uc740 \ud654\uba74\uc774\ub098 \uc74c\uc131 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc88\uac70\ub86d\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc790\uae30 \ub180\uc774(self-play)\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc870\uc815 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud558\ub098\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\ub97c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud558\uace0 \ub2e4\ub978 \ud558\ub098\ub294 AI \uc5b4\uc2dc\uc2a4\ud134\ud2b8\ub97c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud558\ub294 \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc8fc\uc5b4\uc9c4 \uacbd\uc6b0, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uac00 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ud638\ud55c \ucffc\ub9ac\ub97c \uc81c\ucd9c\ud558\uace0 AI \uc5b4\uc2dc\uc2a4\ud134\ud2b8\uac00 \uc751\ub2f5 \ubc29\uc548\uc744 \uacb0\uc815\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294 \ub300\ud654\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uac01 \uba85\ud655\ud654 \uc9c8\ubb38\uacfc \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \uac01 \ub2e8\uc5b4\uc758 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uc785\ub825\uc73c\ub85c \ubc1b\uc544\ub4e4\uc774\uace0, \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ubc18\uc601\ub41c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\ub77c\ub294 \uc694\uccad\uc744 \ubc1b\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac15\ud654 \uc790\uae30 \ud6c8\ub828(ReST)\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\uc2dc\ucf1c \ub192\uc740 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uc774\uac83\uc774 \uc81c\uacf5\ub41c \ube44\uc6a9\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc608\uce21 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubcc0\ud654\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc870\uc815 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc815\ucc45\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc9d0\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc808\ucc28\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc2dc \uad00\ucc30\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uc22b\uc790 \ube44\uc6a9 \uac12\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}
