The emergence of advanced large language models presents a promising yet largely unexplored opportunity to develop autonomous agents as inference attack experts, helping address this challenge. In this paper, we propose AttackPilot, an autonomous agent capable of independently conducting inference attacks without human intervention. We evaluate it on 20 target services. The evaluation shows that our agent, using GPT-4o, achieves a 100.0% task completion rate and near-expert attack performance, with an average token cost of only $0.627 per run. The agent can also be powered by many other representative LLMs and can adaptively optimize its strategy under service constraints. We further perform trace analysis, demonstrating that design choices, such as a multi-agent framework and task-specific action spaces, effectively mitigate errors such as bad plans, inability to follow instructions, task context loss, and hallucinations. We anticipate that such agents could empower non-expert ML service providers, auditors, or regulators to systematically assess the risks of ML services without requiring deep domain expertise.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uac1c\uc785 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\ub860 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 AttackPilot\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ucd94\ub860 \uacf5\uaca9\uc740 ML \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc758 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \uc704\ud5d8 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub098, \ube44\uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc5d0\uac8c\ub294 \uad6c\ud604\uacfc \ucd5c\uc801 \ucd94\uc815\uc758 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\uac00 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "GPT-4o\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 AttackPilot\ub77c\ub294 \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uace0 20\uac1c\uc758 \ud0c0\uac9f \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "AttackPilot\uc740 100%\uc758 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc644\ub8cc\uc728\uacfc \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, \ud3c9\uade0 \ud1a0\ud070 \ube44\uc6a9\uc740 $0.627\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ube44\uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc758 ML \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uc81c\uacf5\uc790, \uac10\uc0ac\uc790 \ub610\ub294 \uaddc\uc81c\uc790\uac00 ML \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc758 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ub3c4\uc640\uc904 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd94\ub860 \uacf5\uaca9\uc740 \ub110\ub9ac \uc5f0\uad6c\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70 ML \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \uc704\ud5d8 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ube44\uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc5d0\uac8c \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \ucd94\uc815\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uacf5\uaca9 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \uad6c\ud604\uc740 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uace0\uae09 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ucd9c\ud604\uc740 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc774 \ub418\ub294 \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc720\ub9dd\ud558\ub098 \uc544\uc9c1 \ud0d0\uad6c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uae30\ud68c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uac1c\uc785 \uc5c6\uc774 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\ub860 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 AttackPilot\ub77c\ub294 \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 20\uac1c\uc758 \ud0c0\uac9f \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud3c9\uac00 \uacb0\uacfc, GPT-4o\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 100.0%\uc758 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc644\ub8cc\uc728\uacfc \uadfc\uc0ac \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc758 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \ub2e8 \ud55c \ubc88\uc758 \uc2e4\ud589\ub2f9 \ud3c9\uade0 \ud1a0\ud070 \ube44\uc6a9\uc740 $0.627\uc5d0 \ubd88\uacfc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub2e4\ub978 \ub300\ud45c\uc801\uc778 LLM\uc73c\ub85c\ub3c4 \uc791\ub3d9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uc81c\uc57d \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud2b8\ub808\uc774\uc2a4 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c \ubc0f \uc791\uc5c5\ubcc4 \ud589\ub3d9 \uacf5\uac04\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc124\uacc4 \uc120\ud0dd\uc774 \ub098\uc05c \uacc4\ud68d, \uc9c0\uce68 \ubd88\uc774\ud589, \uc791\uc5c5 \ub9e5\ub77d \uc190\uc2e4 \ubc0f \ud658\uac01\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc644\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ube44\uc804\ubb38\uac00 ML \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uc81c\uacf5\uc790, \uac10\uc0ac\uc790 \ub610\ub294 \uaddc\uc81c\uc790\uac00 \uae4a\uc740 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc804\ubb38 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 ML \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc758 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \uac15\ud654\ud560 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \uae30\ub300\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Traditional intrusion detection and response systems often rely on static rules and manual workflows, which limit their ability to respond with the speed and precision required in high-stakes environments. To address these challenges, we present the Intrusion Response System Digital Assistant (IRSDA), an agent-based framework designed to deliver autonomous and policy-compliant cyber defense. IRSDA combines Self-Adaptive Autonomic Computing Systems (SA-ACS) with the Knowledge guided Monitor, Analyze, Plan, and Execute (MAPE-K) loop to support real-time, partition-aware decision-making across enterprise infrastructure.\n  IRSDA incorporates a knowledge-driven architecture that integrates contextual information with AI-based reasoning to support system-guided intrusion response. The framework leverages retrieval mechanisms and structured representations to inform decision-making while maintaining alignment with operational policies. We assess the system using a representative real-world microservices application, demonstrating its ability to automate containment, enforce compliance, and provide traceable outputs for security analyst interpretation.

The C programming language, prevalent in CPS development, is crucial for system control where reliability is critical. However, it is also commonly susceptible to vulnerabilities, particularly buffer overflows. Traditional vulnerability discovery techniques often struggle with scalability and precision when applied directly to the binary code of C programs, which can thereby keep programs vulnerable. This work introduces a novel approach designed to overcome these limitations by leveraging model checking and concolic execution techniques to automatically verify security properties of a program's stack memory in binary code, trampoline techniques to perform automated repair of the issues, and crash-inducing inputs to verify if they were successfully removed. The approach constructs a Memory State Space -- MemStaCe -- from the binary program's control flow graph and simulations, provided by concolic execution, of C function calls and loop constructs. The security properties, defined in LTL, model the correct behaviour of functions associated with vulnerabilities and allow the approach to identify vulnerabilities in MemStaCe by analysing counterexample traces that are generated when a security property is violated. These vulnerabilities are then addressed with a trampoline-based binary patching method, and the effectiveness of the patches is checked with crash-inducing inputs extracted during concolic execution. We implemented the approach in the BASICS tool for BO mitigation and evaluated using the Juliet C/C++ and SARD datasets and real applications, achieving an accuracy and precision above 87%, both in detection and correction.

While previous work has demonstrated behavioral backdoor detection within individual LLM architectures, the critical question of cross-LLM generalization remains unexplored, a gap with serious implications for organizations deploying multiple AI systems. We present the first systematic study of cross-LLM behavioral backdoor detection, evaluating generalization across six production LLMs (GPT-5.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Grok 4.1, Llama 4 Maverick, GPT-OSS 120B, and DeepSeek Chat V3.1). Through 1,198 execution traces and 36 cross-model experiments, we quantify a critical finding: single-model detectors achieve 92.7% accuracy within their training distribution but only 49.2% across different LLMs, a 43.4 percentage point generalization gap equivalent to random guessing. Our analysis reveals that this gap stems from model-specific behavioral signatures, particularly in temporal features (coefficient of variation > 0.8), while structural features remain stable across architectures. We show that model-aware detection incorporating model identity as an additional feature achieves 90.6% accuracy universally across all evaluated models.

We introduce TSLEC (Trust-Based Social Learning with Emergent Communication), a framework where agents explicitly teach successful strategies to peers, with knowledge transfer modulated by learned trust relationships. Through experiments with 100 episodes across 30 random seeds, we demonstrate that trust-based social learning reduces episodes-to-convergence by 23.9% (p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 1.98) compared to independent emergence, while producing compositional protocols (C = 0.38) that remain robust under dynamic objectives (Phi > 0.867 decoding accuracy). Trust scores strongly correlate with teaching quality (r = 0.743, p < 0.001), enabling effective knowledge filtering.

While LLMs have thrived on abundant textual data, no comparable corpus exists for CUA trajectories. To address these gaps, we introduce FaraGen, a novel synthetic data generation system for multi-step web tasks. FaraGen can propose diverse tasks from frequently used websites, generate multiple solution attempts, and filter successful trajectories using multiple verifiers. It achieves high throughput, yield, and diversity for multi-step web tasks, producing verified trajectories at approximately $1 each. We use this data to train Fara-7B, a native CUA model that perceives the computer using only screenshots, executes actions via predicted coordinates, and is small enough to run on-device. We find that Fara-7B outperforms other CUA models of comparable size on benchmarks like WebVoyager, Online-Mind2Web, and WebTailBench -- our novel benchmark that better captures under-represented web tasks in pre-existing benchmarks.

Yet, a fundamental challenge persists: how can we verify the correctness of AI model inference when model owners cannot (or will not) reveal their parameters? These parameters represent enormous training costs and valuable intellectual property, making transparent verification difficult. In this paper, we introduce a zero-knowledge framework capable of verifying deep learning inference without exposing model internal parameters. Built on recursively composed zero-knowledge proofs and requiring no trusted setup, our framework supports both linear and nonlinear neural network layers, including matrix multiplication, normalization, softmax, and SiLU. Leveraging the Fiat-Shamir heuristic, we obtain a succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge (zkSNARK) with constant-size proofs. To demonstrate the practicality of our approach, we translate the DeepSeek model into a fully SNARK-verifiable version named ZK-DeepSeek and show experimentally that our framework delivers both efficiency and flexibility in real-world AI verification workloads.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378 \ub0b4\ubd80 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uacf5\uac1c\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0\ub3c4 \ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc81c\ub85c \uc9c0\uc2dd \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AI \ubaa8\ub378 \ucd94\ub860\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubaa8\ub378 \uc18c\uc720\uc790\uac00 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uacf5\uac1c\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc744 \uacbd\uc6b0 \uac80\uc99d\uc774 \uc5b4\ub835\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc7ac\uadc0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \uc81c\ub85c \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc99d\uba85\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uace0, \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc124\uc815\uc774 \ud544\uc694 \uc5c6\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 DeepSeek \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc644\uc804\ud788 SNARK \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubc84\uc804\uc778 ZK-DeepSeek\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\uace0, \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc720\uc5f0\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c AI \uac80\uc99d \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc720\uc5f0\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5(AI), \ud2b9\ud788 \ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc751\uc6a9\uc5d0 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud558\uac8c \ucc44\ud0dd\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc18c\uc720\uc790\uac00 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uacf5\uac1c\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\uac70\ub098 \uacf5\uac1c\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc744 \ub54c AI \ubaa8\ub378 \ucd94\ub860\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uac80\uc99d\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uac00\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub294 \ub9c9\ub300\ud55c \ud6c8\ub828 \ube44\uc6a9\uacfc \uadc0\uc911\ud55c \uc9c0\uc801 \uc7ac\uc0b0\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\ubbc0\ub85c \ud22c\uba85\ud55c \uac80\uc99d\uc774 \uc5b4\ub835\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378 \ub0b4\ubd80 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \ub178\ucd9c\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc81c\ub85c \uc9c0\uc2dd \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc7ac\uadc0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \uc81c\ub85c \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc99d\uba85\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uba70 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc124\uc815\uc774 \ud544\uc694 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc6b0\ub9ac \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ub9e4\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc2a4 \uacf1\uc148, \uc815\uaddc\ud654, \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\ub9e5\uc2a4 \ubc0f SiLU\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uc120\ud615 \ubc0f \ube44\uc120\ud615 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \uacc4\uce35\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Preprint prepared during the author's PhD research at the Open University of Cyprus and the University of Milano-Bicocca. Introduces a unified framework for adaptive multi-agent learning with information-theoretic, causal, and clustering diagnostics", "summary": "Multi-agent systems often operate under feedback, adaptation, and non-stationarity, yet many simulation studies retain static decision rules and fixed control parameters. This paper introduces a general adaptive multi-agent learning framework that integrates: (i) four dynamic regimes distinguishing static versus adaptive agents and fixed versus adaptive system parameters; (ii) information-theoretic diagnostics (entropy rate, statistical complexity, and predictive information) to assess predictability and structure; (iii) structural causal models for explicit intervention semantics; (iv) procedures for generating agent-level priors from aggregate or sample data; and (v) unsupervised methods for identifying emergent behavioral regimes. The framework offers a domain-neutral architecture for analyzing how learning agents and adaptive controls jointly shape system trajectories, enabling systematic comparison of stability, performance, and interpretability across non-equilibrium, oscillatory, or drifting dynamics. Mathematical definitions, computational operators, and an experimental design template are provided, yielding a structured methodology for developing explainable and contestable multi-agent decision processes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5\uacfc \uc801\uc751\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub9ce\uc740 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub4e4\uc774 \uc815\uc801\uc778 \uacb0\uc815 \uaddc\uce59\uacfc \uace0\uc815\ub41c \uc81c\uc5b4 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ubc18\uba74, \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uacfc \uc801\uc751, \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc131\uc744 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub3d9\uc801 \ub808\uc9d0, \uc815\ubcf4 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc9c4\ub2e8, \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc778\uacfc \ubaa8\ub378, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc0ac\uc804 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc808\ucc28, \ube44\uc9c0\ub3c4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uada4\uc801\uc744 \ud615\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \uc801\uc751 \uc81c\uc5b4\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc911\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc548\uc815\uc131, \uc131\ub2a5, \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ube44\uad50\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \uc124\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \ub17c\ub780\uc758 \uc5ec\uc9c0\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uae30\uc5ec\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31, \uc801\uc751 \ubc0f \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc801 \uc870\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub9ce\uc740 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc815\uc801\uc778 \uacb0\uc815 \uaddc\uce59\uacfc \uace0\uc815\ub41c \uc81c\uc5b4 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 (i) \uc815\uc801 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8, \uace0\uc815 \ubc0f \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uad6c\ubd84\ud558\ub294 \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub3d9\uc801 \ub808\uc9d0;

These generators are typically based on a few core architectural families, primarily Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models (DMs). A critical vulnerability in current forensics is the failure of detectors to achieve cross-generator generalization, especially when crossing architectural boundaries (e.g., from GANs to DMs). We hypothesize that this gap stems from fundamental differences in the artifacts produced by these \\textbf{distinct architectures}. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis explaining how the distinct optimization objectives of the GAN and DM architectures lead to different manifold coverage behaviors. We demonstrate that GANs permit partial coverage, often leading to boundary artifacts, while DMs enforce complete coverage, resulting in over-smoothing patterns. Motivated by this analysis, we propose the \\textbf{Tri}archy \\textbf{Detect}or (TriDetect), a semi-supervised approach that enhances binary classification by discovering latent architectural patterns within the \"fake\" class. TriDetect employs balanced cluster assignment via the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm and a cross-view consistency mechanism, encouraging the model to learn fundamental architectural distincts. We evaluate our approach on two standard benchmarks and three in-the-wild datasets against 13 baselines to demonstrate its generalization capability to unseen generators.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 GAN\uacfc DM\uc758 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ucc28\uc774\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uc9c4\uc704 \uac10\ubcc4\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c TriDetect\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc18\uac10\ub3c5 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc7a5\uce58\uc758 \uad6c\uc870\uac00 \ub2e4\ub984\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc544\ud2f0\ud329\ud2b8\uc758 \ucc28\uc774\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ud604\uc7ac \ud3ec\ub80c\uc2dd\uc5d0\uc11c \ud0d0\uc9c0\uae30\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\uc5d0 \uc2e4\ud328\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "TriDetect\ub294 \ubc18\uac10\ub3c5 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c, Sinkhorn-Knopp \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \uade0\ud615 \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130 \ud560\ub2f9\uacfc \uad50\ucc28 \ubdf0 \uc77c\uad00\uc131 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec '\uac00\uc9dc' \ud074\ub798\uc2a4 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \uad6c\uc870 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "TriDetect\ub97c \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud45c\uc900 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ubc0f \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc790\uc5f0 \ud658\uacbd \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc5ec 13\uac1c\uc758 \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc744 \uc0c1\ub300\ub85c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c TriDetect\ub294 GAN\uacfc DM\uc758 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc9c4\uc9dc\uc640 \uac00\uc9dc\ub97c \ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ub958\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubc1c\uc804\ud558\ub294 \uc0dd\uc131\uae30(\uc608: StyleGAN, Midjourney, DALL-E)\uc758 \ube60\ub978 \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc0ac\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \ud569\uc131 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \ubbf8\ub514\uc5b4\uc758 \uc9c4\uc704 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804\uc744 \uc81c\uae30\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc0dd\uc131\uae30\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc8fc\ub85c \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(GAN)\uacfc \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378(DM)\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uba87 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \ud328\ubc00\ub9ac \uae30\ubc18\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud604\uc7ac \ud3ec\ub80c\uc2dd\uc758 \uce58\uba85\uc801\uc778 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc740 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uae30\uac00 \uc0dd\uc131\uae30 \uac04 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\uc5d0 \uc2e4\ud328\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c, \ud2b9\ud788 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \ub118\uc744 \ub54c(\uc608: GAN\uc5d0\uc11c DM\uc73c\ub85c) \ud2b9\ud788 \uadf8\ub807\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uaca9\ucc28\uac00 \uc774 \textbf{\ubcc4\uac1c\uc758 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98}\uac00 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc544\ud2f0\ud329\ud2b8\uc758 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ucc28\uc774\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uae30\uc778\ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \uac00\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 GAN\uacfc DM \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc758 \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubaa9\ud45c\uac00 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ub2e4\ub978 \ub2e4\uc591\uccb4 \ucee4\ubc84\ub9ac\uc9c0 \ub3d9\uc791\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud558\ub294\uc9c0 \uc124\uba85\ud558\ub294 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 GAN\uc774 \ubd80\ubd84\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucee4\ubc84\ub9ac\uc9c0\ub97c \ud5c8\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc885\uc885 \uacbd\uacc4 \uc544\ud2f0\ud329\ud2b8\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud558\uace0, DM\uc740 \uc644\uc804\ud55c \ucee4\ubc84\ub9ac\uc9c0\ub97c \uac15\uc81c\ud558\uc5ec \uacfc\ub3c4\ud55c \ud3c9\ud65c \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ub3d9\uae30 \ubd80\uc5ec\ub97c \ubc1b\uace0, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \textbf{Tri}archy \textbf{Detect}or(TriDetect)\ub77c\ub294 \ubc18\uac10\ub3c5 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec '\uac00\uc9dc' \ud074\ub798\uc2a4 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\uc9c4 \ubd84\ub958\ub97c \uac15\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

You are using WhatsApp: Enumerating Three Billion Accounts for Security and Privacy", "comment": "Accepted to NDSS2026, Artifacts available at https://github.com/sbaresearch/whatsapp-census", "summary": "WhatsApp, with 3.5 billion active accounts as of early 2025, is the world's largest instant messaging platform. Given its massive user base, WhatsApp plays a critical role in global communication.\n  To initiate conversations, users must first discover whether their contacts are registered on the platform. This is achieved by querying WhatsApp's servers with mobile phone numbers extracted from the user's address book (if they allowed access). This architecture inherently enables phone number enumeration, as the service must allow legitimate users to query contact availability. While rate limiting is a standard defense against abuse, we revisit the problem and show that WhatsApp remains highly vulnerable to enumeration at scale. In our study, we were able to probe over a hundred million phone numbers per hour without encountering blocking or effective rate limiting.\n  Our findings demonstrate not only the persistence but the severity of this vulnerability. We further show that nearly half of the phone numbers disclosed in the 2021 Facebook data leak are still active on WhatsApp, underlining the enduring risks associated with such exposures. Moreover, we were able to perform a census of WhatsApp users, providing a glimpse on the macroscopic insights a large messaging service is able to generate even though the messages themselves are end-to-end encrypted. Using the gathered data, we also discovered the re-use of certain X25519 keys across different devices and phone numbers, indicating either insecure (custom) implementations, or fraudulent activity.\n  In this updated version of the paper, we also provide insights into the collaborative remediation process through which we confirmed that the underlying rate-limiting issue had been resolved.", "AI":

To address this gap, we introduce Language-Controlled Diverse Style Policies (LCDSP), a novel LC-RL paradigm specifically designed for complex scenarios. LCDSP comprises two key components: a Diverse Style Training (DST) method and a Style Interpreter (SI). The DST method efficiently trains a single policy capable of exhibiting a wide range of diverse behaviors by modulating agent actions through style parameters (SP). The SI is designed to accurately and rapidly translate high-level language instructions into these corresponding SP. Through extensive experiments in a complex 5v5 football environment, we demonstrate that LCDSP effectively comprehends abstract tactical instructions and accurately executes the desired diverse behavioral styles, showcasing its potential for complex, real-world applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uace0\uae09 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \uc9c0\uc2dc\ub97c \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0 \uc2e4\ud589\ud558\ub294 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 LCDSP\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uace0\uae09 \ub610\ub294 \ucd94\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \uc9c0\uc2dc\ub97c \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0 \uc2e4\ud589\ud558\ub294 LC-RL\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\ub824\ub294 \ud544\uc694\uc131.", "method": "LCDSP\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c \ud6c8\ub828 \ubc29\ubc95(DST)\uacfc \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c \ud574\uc11d\uae30(SI)\uc758 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud575\uc2ec \uc694\uc18c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c 5v5 \ucd95\uad6c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c LCDSP\ub294 \ucd94\uc0c1 \uc804\uc220 \uc9c0\uc2dc\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0 \uc694\uad6c\ub418\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9 \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c\uc744 \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \uc2e4\ud589\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "LCDSP\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc2e4\uc81c \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uae30\ubcf8 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uacfc \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \uba85\ub839(\uc608: \ubb3c\uccb4 \uc870\uc791 \ubc0f \ud0d0\uc0c9)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5b8\uc5b4 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(LC-RL)\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \ucd95\uad6c \uac8c\uc784\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uace0\uae09 \ub610\ub294 \ucd94\uc0c1 \uc9c0\uc2dc\ub97c \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0 \uc2e4\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ub370 LK-RL\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub85c \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \ud2b9\ubcc4\ud788 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 LC-RL \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc778 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c \uc815\ucc45(LCDSP)\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

A Critical Framework for Policy Uses of Neuroeconomics", "comment": "Durham Economic Journal 2025", "summary": "Neuroeconomics promises to ground welfare analysis in neural and computational evidence about how people value outcomes, learn from experience and exercise self-control. At the same time, policy and commercial actors increasingly invoke neural data to justify paternalistic regulation, \"brain-based\" interventions and new welfare measures. This paper asks under what conditions neural data can legitimately inform welfare judgements for policy rather than merely describing behaviour. I develop a non-empirical, model-based framework that links three levels: neural signals, computational decision models and normative welfare criteria. Within an actor-critic reinforcement-learning model, I formalise the inference path from neural activity to latent values and prediction errors and then to welfare claims. I show that neural evidence constrains welfare judgements only when the neural-computational mapping is well validated, the decision model identifies \"true\" interests versus context-dependent mistakes, and the welfare criterion is explicitly specified and defended. Applying the framework to addiction, neuromarketing and environmental policy, I derive a Neuroeconomic Welfare Inference Checklist for regulators and for designers of NeuroAI systems. The analysis treats brains and artificial agents as value-learning systems while showing that internal reward signals, whether biological or artificial, are computational quantities and cannot be treated as welfare measures without an explicit normative model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc2e0\uacbd\uacbd\uc81c\ud559\uc774 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ubcf5\uc9c0 \ud310\ub2e8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c

We introduce VISTA-Gym, a scalable training environment for incentivizing tool-integrated visual reasoning capabilities in VLMs. VISTA-Gym unifies diverse real-world multimodal reasoning tasks (7 tasks from 13 datasets in total) with a standardized interface for visual tools (e.g., grounding, parsing), executable interaction loops, verifiable feedback signals, and efficient trajectory logging, enabling visual agentic reinforcement learning at scale. While recent VLMs exhibit strong text-only reasoning, both proprietary and open-source models still struggle with tool selection, invocation, and coordination. With VISTA-Gym, we train VISTA-R1 to interleave tool-use with agentic reasoning via multi-turn trajectory sampling and end-to-end reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments across 11 public reasoning-intensive VQA benchmarks show that VISTA-R1-8B outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with similar sizes by 9.51%-18.72%, demonstrating VISTA-Gym as an effective training ground to unlock the tool-integrated reasoning capabilities for VLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "VISTA-Gym\uc740 VLM\uc758 \ub3c4\uad6c \ud1b5\ud569 \uc2dc\uac01 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud6c8\ub828 \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 VISTA-R1\uc774 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ucd08\uc6d4\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ucd5c\uadfc \ube44\uc804-\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(VLM)\uc774 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uc774\ud574 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc0ac\uace0\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc774\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "VISTA-Gym\uc740 \uc2dc\uac01 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud45c\uc900 \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\uc640 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ub8e8\ud504, \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \uc2e0\ud638 \ub4f1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \ucd94\ub860 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "VISTA-R1\uc740 11\uac1c\uc758 \uacf5\uacf5 VQA \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c 9.51%-18.72%\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ub3c4\uad6c \ud1b5\ud569 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ub370 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ud6c8\ub828 \ud658\uacbd\uc784\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "VISTA-Gym\uc740 VLM\uc758 \ub3c4\uad6c \ud1b5\ud569 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac1c\ubc29\ud558\ub294 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ud6c8\ub828 \uacf5\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc \ube44\uc804-\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(VLM)\uc740 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uc774\ud574\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc9c0\ub9cc, '\uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub85c \uc0ac\uace0\ud558\ub294' \ub2a5\ub825, \uc989 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc2dc\uac01 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc740 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 VLM\uc5d0\uc11c \ub3c4\uad6c \ud1b5\ud569 \uc2dc\uac01 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc7a5\ub824\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud6c8\ub828 \ud658\uacbd\uc778 VISTA-Gym\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.

Typically, these decisions are made by users during app installation or at runtime. Due to the increasing complexity and automation of systems, making these access control decisions can add a significant cognitive load on users, often overloading them and leading to suboptimal or even arbitrary access control decisions. To address this problem, we propose to leverage the processing and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to make dynamic, context-aware decisions aligned with the user's security preferences. For this purpose, we conducted a user study, which resulted in a dataset of 307 natural-language privacy statements and 14,682 access control decisions made by users. We then compare these decisions against those made by two versions of LLMs: a general and a personalized one, for which we also gathered user feedback on 1,446 of its decisions.\n  Our results show that in general, LLMs can reflect users' preferences well, achieving up to 86\\% accuracy when compared to the decision made by the majority of users.

To solve this problem, we developed an agent-based model that pairs realistic gossip processes with different variants of Trust Game. The results show that cooperators suffer when local interactions govern spread of gossip, because they cannot discriminate against defectors. Realistic gossiping increases the overall amount of resources, but is more likely to promote defection. Moreover, even partner selection through dynamic networks can lead to high payoff inequalities among agent types. Cooperators face a choice between outcompeting defectors and overall growth. By blending direct and indirect reciprocity with reputations we show that gossiping increases the efficiency of cooperation by an order of magnitude.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \uc218\ub2e4 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \ud611\ub825 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0, \uc218\ub2e4\uc758 \ud655\uc0b0 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \ud611\ub825\uc790\uc5d0\uac8c \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \ubd80\uc815\uc801 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uba85\uc774\uc2e0\ub8b0\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uad50\ud658 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud611\ub825 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574. \uc218\ub2e4\uc758 \uc804\ud30c \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \ube44\ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc810\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \uc218\ub2e4 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubcc0\ud615\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0 \uac8c\uc784\uacfc \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub85c\uceec \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc218\ub2e4\uc758 \ud655\uc0b0\uc774 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc9c8 \ub54c, \ud611\ub825\uc790\ub4e4\uc740 \ubc30\uc2e0\uc790\ub97c \ud310\ubcc4\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\uc5b4 \ud53c\ud574\ub97c \ubcf8\ub2e4. \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \uc218\ub2e4 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc790\uc6d0\uc758 \uc804\uccb4\ub7c9\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a4\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubc30\uc2e0\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud560 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \ub354 \ud06c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc774\uba70 \uac04\uc811\uc801\uc778 \uc0c1\ud638 \ud638\ud61c\uc131\uacfc \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub97c \ud63c\ud569\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368, \uc218\ub2e4\ub294 \ud611\ub825\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc218\ub2e4\ub294 \uba85\uc608 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uad50\ud658 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud611\ub825 \ubb38\uc81c\uc758 \uc0c1\ub300\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub9ce\uc740 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub4e4\uc774 \uc218\ub2e4\ub97c \ube44\ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac1c\ub150\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uac70\uc758 \uc644\ubcbd\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4\ub098 \ubc29\uc1a1\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc804\ud30c\uc758 \uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uac00\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \uc218\ub2e4 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubcc0\ud615\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0 \uac8c\uc784\uacfc \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uacb0\uacfc\ub294, \ub85c\uceec \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc774 \uc218\ub2e4\uc758 \ud655\uc0b0\uc744 \uc9c0\ubc30\ud560 \ub54c \ud611\ub825\uc790\ub4e4\uc774 \ubc30\uc2e0\uc790\ub97c \ud310\ubcc4\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\uc5b4 \ud53c\ud574\ub97c \ubcf8\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \uc218\ub2e4 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc790\uc6d0\uc758 \uc804\uccb4\ub7c9\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a4\uc9c0\ub9cc \ubc30\uc2e0\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud560 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \ub354 \ub192\ub2e4. \uac8c\ub2e4\uac00 \ub3d9\uc801 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \ud30c\ud2b8\ub108 \uc120\ud0dd\uc870\ucc28 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc720\ud615 \uac04\uc758 \ub192\uc740 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubd88\ud3c9\ub4f1\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc9c8 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \ud611\ub825\uc790\ub4e4\uc740 \ubc30\uc2e0\uc790\ub97c \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\uace0 \uc804\uccb4 \uc131\uc7a5\uc744 \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc0ac\uc774\uc5d0\uc11c \uc120\ud0dd\uc744 \ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uac04\uc811\uc801\uc778 \uc0c1\ud638 \ud638\ud61c\uc131\uc744 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc640 \ud63c\ud569\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc218\ub2e4\uac00 \ud611\ub825\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud070 \ud3ed\uc73c\ub85c \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4."}}

Inspired by the foundation model recipe (large-scale pretraining followed by light RL) we ask whether a single agent can be trained on hundreds of tasks with online interaction. To accelerate research in this direction, we introduce a new benchmark with 200 diverse tasks spanning many domains and embodiments, each with language instructions, demonstrations, and optionally image observations. We then present \\emph{Newt}, a language-conditioned multitask world model that is first pretrained on demonstrations to acquire task-aware representations and action priors, and then jointly optimized with online interaction across all tasks.

Our method leverages retrieval-augmented prompting, logit biasing and optional classification heads to inject symbolic intent structure into both input and output representations. We formalize a new evaluation metric-Semantic Intent Similarity (SIS)-based on hierarchical ontology depth, capturing semantic proximity even when predicted intents differ lexically. Experiments on a subset of ambiguous/demanding dialogues of MultiWOZ 2.3 (with oracle labels from GPT-o3) demonstrate that a 3B Llama model with ontology augmentation approaches GPT-4 accuracy (85% vs 90%) at a tiny fraction of the energy and memory footprint. Qualitative comparisons show that ontology-augmented models produce more grounded, disambiguated multi-intent interpretations.

These legacy schemes rely on a monolithic identity root with no inherent context isolation, algorithm agility, or secure secret rotation. This paper introduces MSCIKDF, a single-root, multi-curve, context-isolated, PQC-pluggable cryptographic identity primitive. MSCIKDF defines a new architectural foundation where identity is derived deterministically but with cryptographically enforced separation across diverse contexts (e.g., blockchain, E2EE, KMS, IoT). It achieves strong security invariants -- such as zero-linkability, multi-curve independence, and resistance to cross-context correlation -- while offering stateless secret rotation that preserves long-term identity continuity without requiring asset migration. MSCIKDF is proposed as an infrastructure-level upgrade to deterministic identity, establishing a durable and algorithm-agnostic root of trust suitable for the next decade of distributed systems, AI agents, and PQC migration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud604\ub300 \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc554\ud638\ud654\ub41c \uc544\uc774\ub374\ud2f0\ud2f0 \ud504\ub9ac\ubbf8\ud2f0\ube0c\uc778 MSCIKDF\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ud45c\uc900(BIP-39 \ubc0f BIP-32)\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \uace1\uc120, \ub2e4\uc911 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ubc0f \uc591\uc790 \ub0b4\uc131 \ud658\uacbd\uc758 \uc694\uad6c\uc5d0 \ubd80\ud569\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0, \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uad6c\uc870\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "MSCIKDF\ub294 \ub2e8\uc77c \ub8e8\ud2b8, \ub2e4\uc911 \uace1\uc120, \ub9e5\ub77d \uaca9\ub9ac\ub41c, PQC \ud50c\ub7ec\uadf8 \uac00\ub2a5 \uc554\ud638\ud654\ub41c \uc544\uc774\ub374\ud2f0\ud2f0 \ud504\ub9ac\ubbf8\ud2f0\ube0c\ub97c \uc815\uc758\ud558\uace0, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uacb0\uc815\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc544\uc774\ub374\ud2f0\ud2f0\ub97c \uc720\ub3c4\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "MSCIKDF\ub294 \uc81c\ub85c \ub9c1\ud06c \uac00\ub2a5\uc131, \ub2e4\uc911 \uace1\uc120 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc131 \ubc0f \uad50\ucc28 \ub9e5\ub77d \uc0c1\uad00 \uad00\uacc4 \uc800\ud56d\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ubcf4\uc548 \ubd88\ubcc0\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "MSCIKDF\ub294 \uacb0\uc815\ub860\uc801 \uc544\uc774\ub374\ud2f0\ud2f0\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc778\ud504\ub77c \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc5c5\uadf8\ub808\uc774\ub4dc\ub85c \uc81c\uc548\ub418\uba70, \ud5a5\ud6c4 10\ub144\uac04\uc758 \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c, AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubc0f PQC \ub9c8\uc774\uadf8\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc5d0 \uc801\ud569\ud55c \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc758 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc744 \uc218\ub9bd\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc554\ud638\ud654\ub41c \uc544\uc774\ub374\ud2f0\ud2f0\ub294 \ud604\ub300\uc758 \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc9c0\ud0f1\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, BIP-39 \ubc0f BIP-32\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ud45c\uc900\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \uace1\uc120, \ub2e4\uc911 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ubc0f \ud3ec\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc591\uc790 \ud658\uacbd\uc758 \uc694\uad6c\uc5d0 \uad6c\uc870\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd88\ucda9\ubd84\ud558\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub808\uac70\uc2dc \uc2a4\ud0b4\uc740 \uace0\uc720\ud55c \ub9e5\ub77d \uaca9\ub9ac, \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \uae30\ubbfc\uc131 \ub610\ub294 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \ube44\ubc00 \ud68c\uc804\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc544\uc774\ub374\ud2f0\ud2f0 \ub8e8\ud2b8\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub2e8\uc77c \ub8e8\ud2b8, \ub2e4\uc911 \uace1\uc120, \ub9e5\ub77d\uc774 \uaca9\ub9ac\ub41c PQC \ud50c\ub7ec\uadf8 \uac00\ub2a5 \uc554\ud638\ud654 \uc544\uc774\ub374\ud2f0\ud2f0 \uae30\ubcf8 \uc6d0\ub9ac\uc778 MSCIKDF\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.

This requires coordinating heterogeneous distributed energy resources across multiple time scales and under variable conditions. Among existing tools, typically, power-system simulators capture physical behaviour but assume centralized control, while multi-agent frameworks model decentralized decision-making but represent energy with no physical grounding. In this context, the EnergyTwin is introduced, an agent-based microgrid simulation environment that couples physically grounded models with forecast-informed, rolling-horizon planning, and negotiations. Each asset is modeled as an agent, interacting with a central agent that obtains forecasts, formulates predictions, and allocates energy through contract-based interactions. EnergyTwin targets tertiary-layer decision making and is extensible for digital-twin use. Its feasibility was evaluated in a university campus microgrid scenario where multiple planning strategies were compared. Achieved results show that forecast-driven rolling-horizon planning increases local energy self-sufficiency, maintains higher battery reserves, and reduces exposure to low-resilience operating states. They demonstrate also potential of EnergyTwin as platform supporting research on resilient, negotiation-driven microgrids.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc790\uc6d0 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \ub9c8\uc774\ud06c\ub85c\uadf8\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ud658\uacbd\uc778 EnergyTwin\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub9c8\uc774\ud06c\ub85c\uadf8\ub9ac\ub4dc\ub294 \uad6c\ub9e4\ud55c \uc804\ub825 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0\ub97c \uc904\uc774\uace0, \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc774 \ud070 \uc694\uae08\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub178\ucd9c\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud558\uba70, \uc7a5\uc560 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uc5f0\uc18d\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "EnergyTwin\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \ub9c8\uc774\ud06c\ub85c\uadf8\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ud658\uacbd\uc73c\ub85c, \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ubcf4\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uacc4\ud68d, \ud611\uc0c1\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4. \uac01 \uc790\uc0b0\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ub418\uba70, \uc911\uc559 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc5bb\uace0, \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc218\ub9bd\ud558\uba70, \uacc4\uc57d \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0\ub97c \ud560\ub2f9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc608\uce21 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ub864\ub9c1 \ud638\ub77c\uc774\uc98c \uacc4\ud68d\uc740 \uc9c0\uc5ed \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc790\uae09 \uc790\uc871\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0, \ubc30\ud130\ub9ac \uc608\ube44\ub7c9\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uba70, \uc800\ub0b4\uad6c\uc131 \uc6b4\uc601 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub178\ucd9c\uc744 \uc904\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "EnergyTwin\uc740 \ud68c\ubcf5\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \ud611\uc0c1 \uae30\ubc18 \ub9c8\uc774\ud06c\ub85c\uadf8\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc73c\ub85c\uc11c\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub9c8\uc774\ud06c\ub85c\uadf8\ub9ac\ub4dc\ub294 \uad6c\ub9e4\ud55c \uc804\ub825 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0\ub97c \uc904\uc774\uace0, \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc774 \ud070 \uc694\uae08\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub178\ucd9c\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud558\uba70, \uc7a5\uc560 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uc5f0\uc18d\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubc30\uce58\ub41c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc2dc\uac04\ub300\uc640 \ubcc0\uc218 \uc870\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc790\uc6d0\uc758 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc911, \uc804\ub825 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\ud130\ub294 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ucea1\ucc98\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uc911\uc2dd \uc81c\uc5b4\ub97c \uac00\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ubc18\uba74, \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ubd84\uc0b0 \uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\ub098 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uae30\ucd08\uac00 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0\ub97c \ud45c\ud604\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0\uc11c, EnergyTwin\uc774 \ub3c4\uc785\ub418\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ubcf4\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uacc4\ud68d\uacfc \ud611\uc0c1\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uac16\ucd98 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \ub9c8\uc774\ud06c\ub85c\uadf8\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ud658\uacbd\uc774\ub2e4. \uac01 \uc790\uc0b0\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ub418\uba70 \uc911\uc559 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc5bb\uace0, \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc218\ub9bd\ud558\uba70, \uacc4\uc57d \uae30\ubc18 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0\ub97c \ud560\ub2f9\ud55c\ub2e4.

Existing neural models often struggle to represent these interacting dynamics, leading to unstable predictions and reduced reliability in downstream applications. This work introduces a forecast-blur-denoise framework that improves temporal fidelity through structured noise modeling. The approach incorporates a learnable Gaussian Process module that generates smooth, correlated perturbations, encouraging the forecasting backbone to capture long-range structure while a dedicated refinement model restores high-resolution temporal detail. Training the components jointly enables natural competence division and avoids the artifacts commonly produced by isotropic corruption methods. Experiments across electricity, traffic, and solar datasets show consistent gains in multi-horizon accuracy and stability. The modular design also allows the blur-denoise layer to operate as a lightweight enhancement for pretrained models, supporting efficient adaptation in limited-data scenarios. By strengthening the reliability and interpretability of fine-scale temporal predictions, this framework contributes to more trustworthy AI systems used in forecasting-driven decision support across energy, infrastructure, and other time-critical domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc608\uce21\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uacfc \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc608\uce21\uc740 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uaddc\ubaa8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \ud328\ud134 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc2e4\uc81c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc5b4\ub835\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc608\uce21 \ube14\ub7ec \uc81c\uac70 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ub178\uc774\uc988 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2dc\uac04 \ucda9\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc804\uae30, \uad50\ud1b5, \ud0dc\uc591\uad11 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc9c0\ud3c9 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uacfc \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc758 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0, \uc778\ud504\ub77c \ubc0f \uae30\ud0c0 \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \ubd84\uc57c\uc758 \uc608\uce21 \uae30\ubc18 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uc9c0\uc6d0\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4 \ub354 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc608\uce21\uc740 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \ub9e5\ub77d\uc801 \ud2b8\ub80c\ub4dc\ubd80\ud130 \ube60\ub974\uace0 \ubbf8\uc138\ud55c \ubcc0\ub3d9\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uaddc\ubaa8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\ub294 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \ud328\ud134 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc2e4\uc81c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc5b4\ub835\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc2e0\uacbd \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub3d9\ub825\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\ub294 \ub370 \uc885\uc885 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uc5b4 \ubd88\uc548\uc815\ud55c \uc608\uce21\uacfc \ud558\uc704 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uac10\uc18c\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc9d1\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ub178\uc774\uc988 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2dc\uac04 \ucda9\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \uc608\uce21 \ube14\ub7ec \uc81c\uac70 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \ub9e4\ub044\ub7fd\uace0 \uc0c1\uad00\ub41c \uc12d\ub3d9\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ud559\uc2b5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uac00\uc6b0\uc2dc\uc548 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uc5ec \uc608\uce21 \ubc31\ubcf8\uc774 \uc7a5\uae30 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\uba70, \uc804\uc6a9 \uc815\uc81c \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uace0\ud574\uc0c1\ub3c4 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc138\ubd80 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ubcf5\uc6d0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \uacf5\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7ec\uc6b4 \ub2a5\ub825 \ubd84\ud560\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud574\uc9c0\uace0 \ub4f1\ubc29\ud615 \uc190\uc0c1 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ub418\ub294 \uc778\uacf5\ubb3c\uc744 \ud53c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc804\uae30, \uad50\ud1b5 \ubc0f \ud0dc\uc591\uad11 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc9c0\ud3c9 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uacfc \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec \uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubaa8\ub4c8 \uc124\uacc4\ub294 \ube14\ub7ec \uc81c\uac70 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\uac00 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacbd\ub7c9 \uc99d\uac15\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\ub3d9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc801\uc751\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubbf8\uc138\ud55c \uc2dc\uac04 \uc608\uce21\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uacfc \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0, \uc778\ud504\ub77c \ubc0f \uae30\ud0c0 \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uc608\uce21 \uae30\ubc18 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uc9c0\uc6d0\uc5d0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \ub354 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

While personalized multidisciplinary interventions have the potential to slow disease progression and enhance quality of life, they typically require substantial medical resources and expertise, making them difficult to implement in resource-limited settings. To address this challenge, we developed KOM, a multi-agent system designed to automate KOA evaluation, risk prediction, and treatment prescription. This system assists clinicians in performing essential tasks across the KOA care pathway and supports the generation of tailored management plans based on individual patient profiles, disease status, risk factors, and contraindications. In benchmark experiments, KOM demonstrated superior performance compared to several general-purpose large language models in imaging analysis and prescription generation. A randomized three-arm simulation study further revealed that collaboration between KOM and clinicians reduced total diagnostic and planning time by 38.5% and resulted in improved treatment quality compared to each approach used independently. These findings indicate that KOM could help facilitate automated KOA management and, when integrated into clinical workflows, has the potential to enhance care efficiency. The modular architecture of KOM may also offer valuable insights for developing AI-assisted management systems for other chronic conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "KOM\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ubb34\ub98e \uace8\uad00\uc808\uc5fc(KOA)\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00, \uc704\ud5d8 \uc608\uce21 \ubc0f \uce58\ub8cc \ucc98\ubc29\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \uc784\uc0c1 \uc758\uc0ac\uc5d0\uac8c \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc744 \uc8fc\uba70, \uc9c4\ub2e8 \ubc0f \uacc4\ud68d \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 38.5% \ub2e8\ucd95\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uce58\ub8cc \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uae30\uc5ec\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc804 \uc138\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c 6\uc5b5 \uba85 \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uc0ac\ub78c\uc774 \uc0ac\ub294 KOA\ub294 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \ud1b5\uc99d\uacfc \uae30\ub2a5 \uc7a5\uc560\ub97c \uc720\ubc1c\ud558\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uac1c\uc778 \ub9de\ucda4\ud615 \ub2e4\ud559\uc81c\uc801 \uc811\uadfc\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "KOM\uc740 KOA\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00, \uc704\ud5d8 \uc608\uce21, \uce58\ub8cc \ucc98\ubc29\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774\ub2e4.", "result": "KOM\uc740 \uc601\uc0c1 \ubd84\uc11d \ubc0f \ucc98\ubc29 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc77c\ubc18 \ubaa9\uc801\uc758 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uace0, \uc784\uc0c1\uc758\uc640 \ud611\ub825\ud560 \ub54c \uc9c4\ub2e8 \ubc0f \uacc4\ud68d \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 38.5% \ub2e8\ucd95\uc2dc\ucf1c \uce58\ub8cc \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \ub192\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "KOM\uc740 KOA \uad00\ub9ac\uc758 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub97c \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\uace0 \uc784\uc0c1 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud750\ub984\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ub420 \ub54c \uce58\ub8cc \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubb34\ub98e \uace8\uad00\uc808\uc5fc(KOA)\uc740 \uc804 \uc138\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c 6\uc5b5 \uba85 \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uac1c\uc778\uc5d0\uac8c \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\uba70 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ud1b5\uc99d, \uae30\ub2a5 \uc7a5\uc560 \ubc0f \uc7a5\uc560\uc640 \uad00\ub828\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac1c\uc778 \ub9de\ucda4\ud615 \ub2e4\ud559\uc81c\uc801 \uac1c\uc785\uc774 \uc9c8\ubcd1 \uc9c4\ud589\uc744 \ub2a6\ucd94\uace0 \uc0b6\uc758 \uc9c8\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc774 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc758\ub8cc \uc790\uc6d0\uacfc \uc804\ubb38 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uc5ec \uc790\uc6d0\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uad6c\ud604\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub835\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 KOA \ud3c9\uac00, \uc704\ud5d8 \uc608\uce21 \ubc0f \uce58\ub8cc \ucc98\ubc29\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc778 KOM\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc784\uc0c1\uc758\uac00 KOA \uce58\ub8cc \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud544\uc218 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc744 \uc8fc\uba70, \uac1c\ubcc4 \ud658\uc790\uc758 \ud504\ub85c\ud544, \uc9c8\ubcd1 \uc0c1\ud0dc, \uc704\ud5d8 \uc694\uc18c \ubc0f \uae08\uae30 \uc0ac\ud56d\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \ub9de\ucda4\ud615 \uad00\ub9ac \uacc4\ud68d \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c KOM\uc740 \uc601\uc0c1 \ubd84\uc11d \ubc0f \ucc98\ubc29 \uc0dd\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc77c\ubc18 \ubaa9\uc801\uc758 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubb34\uc791\uc704 3\uad70 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 KOM\uacfc \uc784\uc0c1\uc758 \uac04\uc758 \ud611\ub825\uc774 \ucd1d \uc9c4\ub2e8 \ubc0f \uacc4\ud68d \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 38.5% \uc904\uc600\uc73c\uba70 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub41c \uac01 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uce58\ub8cc \ud488\uc9c8\uc774 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\uc5c8\uc74c\uc744 \ucd94\uac00\ub85c \ubc1d\ud614\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc1c\uacac\uc740 KOM\uc774 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c KOA \uad00\ub9ac\ub97c \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\uace0 \uc784\uc0c1 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud750\ub984\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ub420 \ub54c \uce58\ub8cc \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc774 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Kasbekar"], "title": "Quantum-Resistant Authentication Scheme for RFID Systems Using Lattice-Based Cryptography", "comment": null, "summary": "We propose a novel quantum-resistant mutual authentication scheme for radio-frequency identification (RFID) systems. Our scheme uses lattice-based cryptography and, in particular, achieves quantum-resistance by leveraging the hardness of the inhomogeneous short integer solution (ISIS) problem. In contrast to prior work, which assumes that the reader-server communication channel is secure, our scheme is secure even when both the reader-server and tag-reader communication channels are insecure. Our proposed protocol provides robust security against man-in-the-middle (MITM), replay, impersonation, and reflection attacks, while also ensuring unforgeability and preserving anonymity. We present a detailed security analysis, including semi-formal analysis and formal verification using the Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool. In addition, we analyze the storage, computation, and communication costs of the proposed protocol and compare its security properties with those of existing protocols, demonstrating that our scheme offers strong security guarantees.

Large language models (LLMs) offer a new paradigm by leveraging their pretrained knowledge and universal token-based representations to propose experiments directly from text-based descriptions. Here, we introduce an LLM-based active learning framework (LLM-AL) that operates in an iterative few-shot setting and benchmark it against conventional ML models across four diverse materials science datasets. We explored two prompting strategies: one using concise numerical inputs suited for datasets with more compositional and structured features, and another using expanded descriptive text suited for datasets with more experimental and procedural features to provide additional context. Across all datasets, LLM-AL could reduce the number of experiments needed to reach top-performing candidates by over 70% and consistently outperformed traditional ML models. We found that LLM-AL performs broader and more exploratory searches while still reaching the optima with fewer iterations. We further examined the stability boundaries of LLM-AL given the inherent non-determinism of LLMs and found its performance to be broadly consistent across runs, within the variability range typically observed for traditional ML approaches. These results demonstrate that LLM-AL can serve as a generalizable alternative to conventional AL pipelines for more efficient and interpretable experiment selection and potential LLM-driven

Preprint submitted to IEEE Vehicle Technology Magazine", "summary": "In the 6G era, semantic collaboration among multiple embodied intelligent devices (MEIDs) becomes crucial for complex task execution. However, existing systems face challenges in multimodal information fusion, adaptive communication, and decision interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose a collaborative Conversational Embodied Intelligence Network (CC-EIN) integrating multimodal feature fusion, adaptive semantic communication, task coordination, and interpretability. PerceptiNet performs cross-modal fusion of image and radar data to generate unified semantic representations. An adaptive semantic communication strategy dynamically adjusts coding schemes and transmission power according to task urgency and channel quality.

To this end, we propose a new multimodal agent framework, Vision-Interleaved Chain-of-Thought Framework (VICoT), which implements explicit multi-round reasoning by dynamically incorporating visual tools into the chain of thought. Through a stack-based reasoning structure and a modular MCP-compatible tool suite, VICoT enables LLMs to efficiently perform multi-round, interleaved vision-language reasoning tasks with strong generalization and flexibility.We also propose the Reasoning Stack distillation method to migrate complex Agent behaviors to small, lightweight models, which ensures the reasoning capability while significantly reducing complexity.

HSTAN employs a decoupled architecture (Graph Attention Network for spatial, cascaded GRU with self-attention for temporal) to achieve superior performance and efficiency, requiring only 12.3 ms inference time (73% faster than Transformer methods) and reducing the Average Displacement Error (ADE) to 0.73m (42.2% better than Social_LSTM) on the NGSIM dataset. Furthermore, Conformalized Quantile Regression enhances reliability by generating prediction intervals (91.3% coverage at 90% confidence), which the DTRA module then converts into timely warnings via a physics-informed risk potential function and an adaptive threshold mechanism inspired by statistical process control.Tested across multi-scenario datasets, the complete system demonstrates high efficacy, achieving an F1 score of 0.912, a low false alarm rate of 8.2%, and an ample warning lead time of 2.8 seconds, validating the framework's superior performance and practical deployment feasibility in complex environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud1b5\ud569 \uc804\ubc29 \ucda9\ub3cc \uacbd\uace0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec, \uacc4\uc0b0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uacfc \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \ubd80\uc871 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0, \ub192\uc740 \ud5c8\uc704 \uacbd\uace0 \ube44\uc728\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uc804\ubc29 \ucda9\ub3cc \uacbd\uace0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uacfc \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \uacb0\uc815 \uc801\uc751\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\ub294 \ub370 \uc2e4\ud328\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc2dc\uacf5\uac04 \uc8fc\uc758 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c(HSTAN)\uc640 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc704\ud5d8 \uc784\uacc4\uac12 \uc870\uc815 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569 FCW \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "HSTAN\uc740 12.3 ms\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud558\uba70, NGSIM \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uade0 \ubcc0\uc704 \uc624\ucc28(ADE)\ub97c 0.73m\ub85c \uc904\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc644\uc804\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 0.912\uc758 F1 \uc810\uc218 \ubc0f 8.2%\uc758 \ub0ae\uc740 \ud5c8\uc704 \uacbd\uace0 \ube44\uc728\uc744 \uae30\ub85d\ud558\uba70, \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \ud65c\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc804\ubc29 \ucda9\ub3cc \uacbd\uace0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ucc28\ub7c9 \uc548\uc804 \ubc0f \uc790\uc728 \uc8fc\ud589\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc815\ubc00\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uacfc \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \uacb0\uc815 \uc801\uc751\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uc5ec \uc5e3\uc9c0 \ubc30\uce58\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub192\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uacfc \ub2e8\uc21c\ud654\ub41c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \ube44\ub86f\ub418\ub294 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uacb0\uc5ec \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uacfc \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \ubd80\uc871 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc815\uc801 \uc784\uacc4\uac12 \uacbd\uace0\uc758 \ub192\uc740 \ud5c8\uc704 \uacbd\uace0 \ube44\uc728\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc2dc\uacf5\uac04 \uc8fc\uc758 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c(HSTAN)\uc640 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc704\ud5d8 \uc784\uacc4\uac12 \uc870\uc815 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569 FCW \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Despite impressive performance, existing multi-agent systems inherently incur substantial token overhead and increased computational costs, posing challenges for large-scale deployment. To address these issues, we propose a novel Multi-Modal Multi-agent hierarchical communication graph PRUNING framework, termed M$^3$Prune. Our framework eliminates redundant edges across different modalities, achieving an optimal balance between task performance and token overhead. Specifically, M$^3$Prune first applies intra-modal graph sparsification to textual and visual modalities, identifying the edges most critical for solving the task. Subsequently, we construct a dynamic communication topology using these key edges for inter-modal graph sparsification. Finally, we progressively prune redundant edges to obtain a more efficient and hierarchical topology. Extensive experiments on both general and domain-specific mRAG benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms both single-agent and robust multi-agent mRAG systems while significantly reducing token consumption.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ub2e4\uc911 \ub300\ud654\ud615 \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c M$^3$Prune

Prior work has identified prompt injection as a new attack vector for web agents, yet the resulting impact within real-world environments remains insufficiently understood.\n  In this work, we examine the landscape of prompt injection attacks and synthesize a benchmark of attacks embedded in realistic HTML payloads. Our benchmark goes beyond prior work by emphasizing injections that can influence real-world actions rather than mere text outputs, and by presenting attack payloads with complexity and distractor frequency similar to what real-world agents encounter. We leverage this benchmark to conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation of existing defenses, assessing their effectiveness across a suite of frontier AI models. We propose a multi-layered defense strategy comprising both architectural and model-based defenses to protect against evolving prompt injection attacks. Our work offers a blueprint for designing practical, secure web agents through a defense-in-depth approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5(AI) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc6f9 \ube0c\ub77c\uc6b0\uc800\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc6f9 \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158 \uc704\ud611 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ub118\uc5b4\uc11c\ub294 \ubcf4\uc548 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc81c\uae30\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc8fc\uc785 \uacf5\uaca9\uc758 \ud604\ud669\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uace0, \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 HTML \ud398\uc774\ub85c\ub4dc\uc5d0 \ub0b4\uc7a5\ub41c \uacf5\uaca9\uc758 \uae30\uc900\uc744 Synthesizes\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ubc29\uc5b4\ucc45\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc9c4\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc8fc\uc785 \uacf5\uaca9\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub2e4\uce35 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubcf4\uc548 \uc774\uc288\ub97c \uba85\ud655\ud788 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ub9c8\ub828\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud568\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc8fc\uc785 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uace0, \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 HTML \ud398\uc774\ub85c\ub4dc\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uacf5\uaca9\uc758 \ud45c\uc900\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c AI \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\uc5b4\ub97c \uc885\ud569\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc8fc\uc785\uc774 \uc2e4\uc81c \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce60 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uace0, \ubc29\uc5b4\ucc45\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub2e4\uce35 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc9c4\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc8fc\uc785 \uacf5\uaca9\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \uc6f9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc124\uacc4\ud558\ub294 \uccad\uc0ac\uc9c4\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5(AI) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc6f9 \ube0c\ub77c\uc6b0\uc800\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc6f9 \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158 \uc704\ud611 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ub118\uc5b4\uc11c\ub294 \ubcf4\uc548 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uc804 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc8fc\uc785\uc744 \uc6f9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacf5\uaca9 \ubca1\ud130\ub85c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud588\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc2e4\uc81c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc601\ud5a5\uc740 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \uc774\ud574\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc8fc\uc785 \uacf5\uaca9\uc758 \uc804\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ud604\ud669\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uace0 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 HTML \ud398\uc774\ub85c\ub4dc\uc5d0 \ub0b4\uc7a5\ub41c \uacf5\uaca9\uc758 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uae30\uc900\uc740 \ubb38\uc11c \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\uc81c \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce60 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc8fc\uc785\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc138\uacc4\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uacbd\ud5d8\ud558\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uacfc \ubc29\ud574 \uc8fc\ud30c\uc218\uc640 \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uacf5\uaca9 \ud398\uc774\ub85c\ub4dc\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\uc5b4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \uc2e4\uc99d \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud558\uace0, \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 AI \ubaa8\ub378 \uc2a4\uc704\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uadf8 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc9c4\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc8fc\uc785 \uacf5\uaca9\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\uc5b4\uc640 \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\uc5b4\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uce35 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc2ec\uce35 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2e4\uc81c\uc801\uc778 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \uc6f9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uccad\uc0ac\uc9c4\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

An LLM vs. Human Coding Tournament on Market-driven Strategic Planning", "comment": null, "summary": "The rapid proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized AI-assisted code generation. This rapid development of LLMs has outpaced our ability to properly benchmark them. Prevailing benchmarks emphasize unit-test pass rates and syntactic correctness. Such metrics understate the difficulty of many real-world problems that require planning, optimization, and strategic interaction. We introduce a multi-agent reasoning-driven benchmark based on a real-world logistics optimization problem (Auction, Pickup, and Delivery Problem) that couples competitive auctions with capacity-constrained routing. The benchmark requires building agents that can (i) bid strategically under uncertainty and (ii) optimize planners that deliver tasks while maximizing profit. We evaluate 40 LLM-coded agents (by a wide range of state-of-the-art LLMs under multiple prompting methodologies, including vibe coding) against 17 human-coded agents developed before the advent of LLMs. Our results over 12 double all-play-all tournaments and $\\sim 40$k matches demonstrate (i) a clear superiority of human(graduate students)-coded agents: the top 5 spots are consistently won by human-coded agents, (ii) the majority of LLM-coded agents (33 out of 40) are beaten by very simple baselines, and (iii) given the best human solution as an input and prompted to improve upon, the best performing LLM makes the solution significantly worse instead of improving it. Our results highlight a gap in LLMs' ability to produce code that works competitively in the real-world, and motivate new evaluations that emphasize reasoning-driven code synthesis in real-world

However, such a design encounters significant challenges, such as the risk of outdated updates from straggler clients degrading the overall model performance and the potential bias introduced by faster clients dominating the learning process, especially under heterogeneous data distributions. Existing methods typically address only one of these issues, creating a conflict where mitigating the impact of outdated updates can exacerbate the bias created by faster clients, and vice versa. To address these challenges, we propose FedEcho, a novel framework that incorporates uncertainty-aware distillation to enhance the asynchronous FL performances under large asynchronous delays and data heterogeneity. Specifically, uncertainty-aware distillation enables the server to assess the reliability of predictions made by straggler clients, dynamically adjusting the influence of these predictions based on their estimated uncertainty. By prioritizing more certain predictions while still leveraging the diverse information from all clients, FedEcho effectively mitigates the negative impacts of outdated updates and data heterogeneity. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that FedEcho consistently outperforms existing asynchronous federated learning baselines, achieving robust performance without requiring access to private

We revisit this bottleneck through the lens of speculation. While traditional predict-verify speculation paradigm can break serial execution, its benefit remains limited, as it retains the full original workload and adds extra inference overhead. We observe that early agent steps often involve simple evidence-gathering, where correct actions can often be predicted without full reasoning. Building on these observations, we present SPAgent, an algorithm-system co-design framework that expands the role of speculation in search agents to reduce latency. Algorithmically, SPAgent introduces a two-phase adaptive speculation mechanism that selectively omits verification when safe. System-wise, a two-level scheduler regulates speculative requests based on engine load to ensure speculation remains beneficial. We implement SPAgent in real-world systems.

However, increasing their complexity often fails to substantially improve their accuracy, leaving them on par with much simpler approaches such as kernel methods and more traditional reduced-order models. In this article, we set out to address this shortcoming and introduce CHONKNORIS (Cholesky Newton--Kantorovich Neural Operator Residual Iterative System), an operator learning paradigm that can achieve machine precision. CHONKNORIS draws on numerical analysis: many nonlinear forward and inverse PDE problems are solvable by Newton-type methods. Rather than regressing the solution operator itself, our method regresses the Cholesky factors of the elliptic operator associated with Tikhonov-regularized Newton--Kantorovich updates. The resulting unrolled iteration yields a neural architecture whose machine-precision behavior follows from achieving a contractive map, requiring far lower accuracy than end-to-end approximation of the solution operator. We benchmark CHONKNORIS on a range of nonlinear forward and inverse problems, including a nonlinear elliptic equation, Burgers' equation, a nonlinear Darcy flow problem, the Calder\u00f3n problem, an inverse wave scattering problem, and a problem from seismic imaging. We also present theoretical guarantees for the convergence of CHONKNORIS in terms of the accuracy of the emulated Cholesky factors. Additionally, we introduce a foundation model variant, FONKNORIS (Foundation Newton--Kantorovich Neural Operator Residual Iterative System), which aggregates multiple pre-trained CHONKNORIS experts for diverse PDEs to emulate the solution map of a novel nonlinear PDE. Our FONKNORIS model is able to accurately solve unseen nonlinear PDEs such as the Klein--Gordon and Sine--Gordon equations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 CHONKNORIS\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc2e0\uacbd \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc790 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uae30\uacc4 \uc815\ubc00\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70 \ube44\uc120\ud615 \ud3b8\ubbf8\ubd84 \ubc29\uc815\uc2dd \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2e0\uacbd \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc790 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uae30\uc874 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "Newton-type \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec Tikhonov-\uc815\uaddc\ud654\ub41c Newton-Kantorovich \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\uc640 \uad00\ub828\ub41c \ud0c0\uc6d0 \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc790\uc758 Cholesky \uc778\uc790\ub97c \ud68c\uadc0\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "CHONKNORIS\ub294 \ube44\uc120\ud615 \ud0c0\uc6d0 \ubc29\uc815\uc2dd, Burgers \ubc29\uc815\uc2dd \ub4f1 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ube44\uc120\ud615 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc131\ub2a5 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud0b9\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uba70, Cholesky \uc778\uc790\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "FONKNORIS \ubaa8\ud615\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ube44\uc120\ud615 PDE\ub97c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc2e0\uacbd \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc790 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ubb34\ud55c \ucc28\uc6d0 \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc790\ub97c \uadfc\uc0ac\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uacfc\ud559 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc8fc\ubaa9\uc744 \ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uadf8 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\uc544, \ucee4\ub110 \ubc29\ubc95 \ubc0f \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uac10\uc18c \ucc28\uc6d0 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ub3d9\ub4f1\ud55c \uc218\uc900\uc5d0 \uba38\ubb3c\ub7ec \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub2e8\uc810\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 CHONKNORIS(Cholesky Newton--Kantorovich Neural Operator Residual Iterative System)\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.

We propose Scalable and Optimistic MBRL (SOMBRL), an approach based on the principle of optimism in the face of uncertainty. SOMBRL learns an uncertainty-aware dynamics model and greedily maximizes a weighted sum of the extrinsic reward and the agent's epistemic uncertainty. SOMBRL is compatible with any policy optimizers or planners, and under common regularity assumptions on the system, we show that SOMBRL has sublinear regret for nonlinear dynamics in the (i) finite-horizon, (ii) discounted infinite-horizon, and (iii) non-episodic settings. Additionally, SOMBRL offers a flexible and scalable solution for principled exploration. We evaluate SOMBRL on state-based and visual-control environments, where it displays strong performance across all tasks and baselines. We also evaluate SOMBRL on a dynamic RC car hardware and show SOMBRL outperforms the state-of-the-art, illustrating the benefits of principled exploration for MBRL.", "AI": {"tldr": "SOMBRL\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c, \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub099\uad00\uc801\uc778 \uc6d0\uce59\uc744 \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(MBRL)\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc774 \uc54c\ub824\uc838 \uc788\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba70, RL \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c1\uc811 \ud559\uc2b5\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "SOMBRL\uc740 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud55c \ub3d9\uc801 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uace0 \uc678\ubd80 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uacfc \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc778\uc2dd\uc801 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc758 \uac00\uc911\ud569\uc744 \ud0d0\uc695\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc774\ub2e4.", "result": "SOMBRL\uc740 \uc720\ud55c \uc218\ud3c9, \ud560\uc778\ub41c \ubb34\ud55c \uc218\ud3c9 \ubc0f \ube44 \uc5d0\ud53c\uc18c\ub4dc \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ube44\uc120\ud615 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc11c\ube0c\uc120\ud615 \ud6c4\ud68c\ub97c \ubcf4\uc774\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "SOMBRL\uc740 \uc6d0\uce59\uc801\uc778 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc720\uc5f0\ud558\uace0 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uc0c1\ud0dc \uae30\ubc18 \ubc0f \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(MBRL)\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc774 \uc54c\ub824\uc838 \uc788\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 RL \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c1\uc811 \ud559\uc2b5\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8ec\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud55c \ub099\uad00\uc131\uc758 \uc6d0\uce59\uc5d0 \uadfc\uac70\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \ub099\uad00\uc801\uc778 MBRL(SOMBRL) \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

However, generic LLM agents and static scripting pipelines lack climate-specific context and flexibility, thus, perform poorly in practice. We present ClimateAgent, an autonomous multi-agent framework that orchestrates end-to-end climate data analytic workflows. ClimateAgent decomposes user questions into executable sub-tasks coordinated by an Orchestrate-Agent and a Plan-Agent; acquires data via specialized Data-Agents that dynamically introspect APIs to synthesize robust download scripts; and completes analysis and reporting with a Coding-Agent that generates Python code, visualizations, and a final report with a built-in self-correction loop. To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce Climate-Agent-Bench-85, a benchmark of 85 real-world tasks spanning atmospheric rivers, drought, extreme precipitation, heat waves, sea surface temperature, and tropical cyclones. On Climate-Agent-Bench-85, ClimateAgent achieves 100% task completion and a report quality score of 8.32, outperforming GitHub-Copilot (6.27) and a GPT-5 baseline (3.26). These results demonstrate that our multi-agent orchestration with dynamic API awareness and self-correcting execution substantially advances reliable, end-to-end automation for climate science analytic tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "ClimateAgent\ub294 \uae30\ud6c4 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\uc11d \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub97c \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, 100% \uc791\uc5c5 \uc644\ub8cc\uc728\uacfc \ub192\uc740 \ubcf4\uace0\uc11c \ud488\uc9c8 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\ud6c4 \uacfc\ud559\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc2a4\ud06c\ub9bd\ud2b8 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc740 \uae30\ud6c4 \ud2b9\uc720\uc758 \ub9e5\ub77d\uacfc \uc720\uc5f0\uc131\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\uc81c \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc800\uc870\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "ClimateAgent\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc758 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud558\uc704 \uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\uace0, Orchestrate-Agent\uc640 Plan-Agent\uac00 \uc870\uc815\ud558\uba70, \ud2b9\uc218\ud654\ub41c Data-Agent\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc218\uc9d1\ud558\uace0, Coding-Agent\uac00 \ud30c\uc774\uc36c \ucf54\ub4dc, \uc2dc\uac01\ud654 \ubc0f \ucd5c\uc885 \ubcf4\uace0\uc11c\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "Climate-Agent-Bench-85\uc5d0\uc11c ClimateAgent\ub294 100% \uc791\uc5c5 \uc644\ub8cc\uc728\uacfc 8.32\uc758 \ubcf4\uace0\uc11c \ud488\uc9c8 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \uae30\ub85d\ud558\uc5ec GitHub-Copilot(6.27)\uacfc GPT-5 \uae30\uc900(3.26)\uc744 \ub2a5\uac00\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc870\uc815\uacfc \ub3d9\uc801 API \uc778\uc2dd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uae30\ud6c4 \uacfc\ud559 \ubd84\uc11d \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \uc5d4\ub4dc \ud22c \uc5d4\ub4dc \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub97c \ud06c\uac8c \ubc1c\uc804\uc2dc\ucf30\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uae30\ud6c4 \uacfc\ud559\uc740 \ubc29\ub300\ud55c \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8 \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18 \uc9c4\uc220\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub97c \uc694\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc2a4\ud06c\ub9bd\ud2b8 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc740 \uae30\ud6c4 \ud2b9\uc720\uc758 \ub9e5\ub77d\uacfc \uc720\uc5f0\uc131\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\uc81c\ub85c \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc800\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 ClimateAgent\ub77c\ub294 \uc790\uc728 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d4\ub4dc \ud22c \uc5d4\ub4dc \uae30\ud6c4 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\uc11d \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub97c \uc870\uc728\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

We used our algorithms in analyzing the behavior of an autonomous agent playing a computer game, and the algorithms correctly identified the winning strategies.

We introduce Adaptive Contrastive Approach (AdaCap), a training scheme that combines a permutation-based contrastive loss with a Tikhonov-based closed-form output mapping. Across 85 real-world regression datasets and multiple architectures, AdaCap yields consistent and statistically significant improvements in the small-sample regime, particularly for residual models. A meta-predictor trained on dataset characteristics (size, skewness, noise) accurately anticipates when AdaCap is beneficial.

CostNav models the complete economic lifecycle including hardware, training, energy, maintenance costs, and delivery revenue with service-level agreements, using industry-derived parameters. \\textbf{To our knowledge, CostNav is the first work to quantitatively expose the gap between navigation research metrics and commercial viability}, revealing that optimizing for task success fundamentally differs from optimizing for economic deployment. Our cost model uses parameters derived from industry data sources (energy rates, delivery service pricing), and we project from a reduced-scale simulation to realistic deliveries. Under this projection, the baseline achieves 43.0\\% SLA compliance but is \\emph{not} commercially viable: yielding a loss of \\$30.009 per run with no finite break-even point, because operating costs are dominated by collision-induced maintenance, which accounts for 99.7\\% of per-run costs and highlights collision avoidance as a key optimization target. We demonstrate a learning-based on-device navigation baseline and establish a foundation for evaluating rule-based navigation, imitation learning, and cost-aware RL training.

In this paper we address the solution of learning problems using these satellite constellations. In particular, we focus on a federated approach, where satellites collect and locally process data, with the ground station aggregating local models. We focus on designing a novel, communication-efficient algorithm that still yields accurate trained models. To this end, we employ several mechanisms to reduce the number of communications with the ground station (local training) and their size (compression). We then propose an error feedback mechanism that enhances accuracy, which yields, as a byproduct, an algorithm-agnostic error feedback scheme that can be more broadly applied.

However, despite their versatility, current training paradigms for model weight optimization methods, like PPO and GRPO, remain relatively impractical with their high computational overhead for rollout convergence. In addition, the resulting agent policies are difficult to interpret, adapt, or incrementally improve. To address this, we investigate creating and refining structured memory of experiential learning of an agent from its environment as an alternative route to agent optimization. We introduce BREW (Bootstrapping expeRientially-learned Environmental knoWledge), a framework for agent optimization for downstream tasks via KB construction and refinement. In our formulation, we introduce an effective method for partitioning agent memory for more efficient retrieval and refinement. BREW uses task graders and behavior rubrics to learn insights while leveraging state-space search for ensuring robustness from the noise and non-specificity in natural language. Empirical results on real world, domain-grounded benchmarks -- OSWorld, $\u03c4^2$Bench, and SpreadsheetBench -- show BREW achieves $10-20\\%$ improvement in task precision, $10-15\\%$ reduction in API/tool calls leading to faster execution time, all while maintaining computational efficiency on par with base models.

While Graph Condensation (GC) offers a promising solution by synthesizing smaller datasets, existing methods falter in the multimodal setting. We identify a dual challenge causing this failure: (1) conflicting gradients arising from semantic misalignments between modalities, and (2) the GNN's message-passing architecture pathologically amplifying this gradient noise across the graph structure. To address this, we propose Structurally-Regularized Gradient Matching (SR-GM), a novel condensation framework tailored for multimodal graphs. SR-GM introduces two synergistic components: first, a gradient decoupling mechanism that resolves inter-modality conflicts at their source via orthogonal projection; and second, a structural damping regularizer that acts directly on the gradient field. By leveraging the graph's Dirichlet energy, this regularizer transforms the topology from a noise amplifier into a stabilizing force during optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SR-GM significantly improves accuracy and accelerates convergence compared to baseline methods. Ablation studies confirm that addressing both gradient conflict and structural amplification in tandem is essential for achieving superior performance. Moreover, the condensed multimodal graphs exhibit strong cross-architecture generalization and promise to accelerate applications like Neural Architecture Search.

However, these approaches often rely on single-shot responses and lack structural diversity in reasoning exploration. In this paper, we propose DRAFT-RL, a novel framework that integrates Chain-of-Draft (CoD) reasoning into multi-agent RL training. Instead of generating single responses, each agent produces multiple drafts per query, which are then evaluated by peer agents and a learned reward model to identify the most promising trajectory. These selected drafts are used to refine future reasoning strategies through actor-critic learning.DRAFT-RL enables explicit multi-path exploration, peer-guided reflection, and reward-aligned selection, resulting in more robust and interpretable LLM agent behavior.

While pseudo-labeling has become a dominant strategy in SSMLL, most existing methods assign equal weights to all pseudo-labels regardless of their quality, which can amplify the impact of noisy or uncertain predictions and degrade the overall performance. In this paper, we theoretically verify that the optimal weight for a pseudo-label should reflect its correctness likelihood. Empirically, we observe that on the same dataset, the correctness likelihood distribution of unlabeled data remains stable, even as the number of labeled training samples varies. Building on this insight, we propose Distribution-Calibrated Pseudo-labeling (DiCaP), a correctness-aware framework that estimates posterior precision to calibrate pseudo-label weights. We further introduce a dual-thresholding mechanism to separate confident and ambiguous regions: confident samples are pseudo-labeled and weighted accordingly, while ambiguous ones are explored by unsupervised contrastive learning.

LaBarbera", "Farnoush Banaei-Kashani"], "title": "FRAGMENTA: End-to-end Fragmentation-based Generative Model with Agentic Tuning for Drug Lead Optimization", "comment": null, "summary": "Molecule generation using generative AI is vital for drug discovery, yet class-specific datasets often contain fewer than 100 training examples. While fragment-based models handle limited data better than atom-based approaches, existing heuristic fragmentation limits diversity and misses key fragments. Additionally, model tuning typically requires slow, indirect collaboration between medicinal chemists and AI engineers. We introduce FRAGMENTA, an end-to-end framework for drug lead optimization comprising: 1) a novel generative model that reframes fragmentation as a \"vocabulary selection\" problem, using dynamic Q-learning to jointly optimize fragmentation and generation; and 2) an agentic AI system that refines objectives via conversational feedback from domain experts. This system removes the AI engineer from the loop and progressively learns domain knowledge to eventually automate tuning. In real-world cancer drug discovery experiments, FRAGMENTA's Human-Agent configuration identified nearly twice as many high-scoring molecules as baselines.

In order to address this problem and offer a solution to increase the generalizability of RL agents, we introduce a new methodology to predict the generalizability score of RL agents based on the internal weights of the agent's neural networks. Using this prediction capability, we propose some changes in the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) loss function to boost the generalization score of the agents trained with this upgraded version.

The opacity of AI systems, combined with the semantic gap between high-level requirements and low-level network representations, creates barriers to traditional verification approaches. These AI-specific challenges are amplified by longstanding issues in Requirements Engineering, including ambiguity in natural language specifications and scalability bottlenecks in formalization. We propose an approach that leverages AI itself to address these challenges through two complementary components.

To address this problem, two main machine learning techniques are proposed and compared. Unlike existing methods, the proposed approaches are size independent and incorporate the Rate-Distortion (RD) costs of neighboring blocks as input features. The first method is a regression based technique that predicts normalized RD costs of a given Coding Unit (CU). As partitioning possesses the Markov property, the associated decision-making problem can be modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and solved by Reinforcement Learning (RL). The second approach is a RL agent learned from trajectories of CU decision across two depths with Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm. Then a pre-determined thresholds are applied for both methods to select a suitable split for the current CU.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 VVC intra partitioning\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uc5ec RDO \uacfc\uc815\uc758 \uc804\uccb4 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8f9\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "RDO \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc804\uccb4 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 VVC intra partitioning\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131 \uc5f0\uad6c\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \uba38\uc2e0 \ub7ec\ub2dd \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0 \ube44\uad50\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ud06c\uae30\uc640 \ubb34\uad00\ud558\uba70, \uc774\uc6c3 \ube14\ub85d\uc758 RD \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uc785\ub825 feature\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc8fc\uc5b4\uc9c4 Coding Unit (CU)\uc758 \uc815\uaddc\ud654\ub41c RD \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \ud68c\uadc0 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\ubc95\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub450 \ubc88\uc9f8 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 DQN \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub450 \uae4a\uc774\uc758 CU \uacb0\uc815 \uacbd\ub85c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c RL \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 CU\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc801\ud569\ud55c \ubd84\ud560\uc744 \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 VVC intra partitioning\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \uc904\uc774\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uba38\uc2e0 \ub7ec\ub2dd \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70 RDO \uacfc\uc815\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ube44\ub514\uc624 \ucf54\ub371(\ubc84\uc11c\ud0c0\uc77c \ube44\ub514\uc624 \ucf54\ub371, VVC)\uc758 \ub0b4\ubd80 \ubd84\ud560\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc5ec \ube44\uc728-\uc65c\uace1 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654(RDO) \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0 \uad00\ub828\ub41c \uc804\uc218 \uac80\uc0c9\uc744 \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \uba38\uc2e0\ub7ec\ub2dd \uae30\uc220\uc774 \uc81c\uc548\ub418\uace0 \ube44\uad50\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc \ub2ec\ub9ac \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ud06c\uae30\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba70 \uc778\uc811 \ube14\ub85d\uc758 \ube44\uc728-\uc65c\uace1(RD) \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uc785\ub825 feature\ub85c \ud3ec\ud568\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc8fc\uc5b4\uc9c4 \ucf54\ub529 \uc720\ub2db(CU)\uc758 \uc815\uaddc\ud654\ub41c RD \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \ud68c\uadc0 \uae30\ubc18 \uae30\uc220\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubd84\ud560\uc774 \ub9c8\ucf54\ud504 \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\ubbc0\ub85c \uad00\ub828 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \ub9c8\ucf54\ud504 \uacb0\uc815 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4(MDP)\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud574\uacb0\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub450 \ubc88\uc9f8 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 DQN \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub450 \uae4a\uc774\uc5d0\uc11c CU \uacb0\uc815\uc758 \uada4\uc801\uc5d0\uc11c \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c RL \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7f0 \ub2e4\uc74c \ub450 \ubc29\ubc95 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ubbf8\ub9ac \uacb0\uc815\ub41c \uc784\uacc4\uac12\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud604\uc7ac CU\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc801\ud569\ud55c \ubd84\ud560\uc744 \uc120\ud0dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Existing evaluations primarily assess unimodal, decontextualized question-answering, overlooking multi-agent decision-making environments such as Molecular Tumor Boards (MTBs). MTBs bring together diverse experts in oncology, where diagnostic and prognostic tasks require integrating heterogeneous data and evolving insights over time. Current benchmarks lack this longitudinal and multimodal complexity. We introduce MTBBench, an agentic benchmark simulating MTB-style decision-making through clinically challenging, multimodal, and longitudinal oncology questions. Ground truth annotations are validated by clinicians via a co-developed app, ensuring clinical relevance. We benchmark multiple open and closed-source LLMs and show that, even at scale, they lack reliability -- frequently hallucinating, struggling with reasoning from time-resolved data, and failing to reconcile conflicting evidence or different modalities. To address these limitations, MTBBench goes beyond benchmarking by providing an agentic framework with foundation model-based tools that enhance multi-modal and longitudinal reasoning, leading to task-level performance gains of up to 9.0% and 11.2%, respectively.

To address this gap, we introduce attention-oriented metrics (ATOMs) to investigate the development of an RL agent's attention during training. In a controlled experiment, we tested ATOMs on three variations of a Pong game, each designed to teach the agent distinct behaviours, complemented by a behavioural assessment. ATOMs successfully delineate the attention patterns of an agent trained on each game variation, and that these differences in attention patterns translate into differences in the agent's behaviour. Through continuous monitoring of ATOMs during training, we observed that the agent's attention developed in phases, and that these phases were consistent across game variations.

Learning their governing dynamics remains a central challenge in scientific machine learning. Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) provides a simple, data-driven approximation, but practical use is limited by sparse/noisy observations from continuous fields, reliance on linear approximations, and the lack of principled uncertainty quantification. To address these issues, we introduce Stochastic NODE-DMD, a probabilistic extension of DMD that models continuous-time, nonlinear dynamics while remaining interpretable. Our approach enables continuous spatiotemporal reconstruction at arbitrary coordinates and quantifies predictive uncertainty. Across four benchmarks, a synthetic setting and three physics-based flows, it surpasses a baseline in reconstruction accuracy when trained from only 10% observation density. It further recovers the dynamical structure by aligning learned modes and continuous-time eigenvalues with ground truth. Finally, on datasets with multiple realizations, our method learns a calibrated distribution over latent dynamics that preserves ensemble variability rather than averaging across regimes.

Recent advances in optimizers have improved convergence efficiency through momentum orthogonalization, but suffer from two key robustness limitations: dimensional fragility in orthogonalization precision and vulnerability to outlier-induced noise. To address these robustness challenges, we introduce ROOT, a Robust Orthogonalized Optimizer that enhances training stability through dual robustness mechanisms. First, we develop a dimension-robust orthogonalization scheme using adaptive Newton iterations with fine-grained coefficients tailored to specific matrix sizes, ensuring consistent precision across diverse architectural configurations. Second, we introduce an optimization-robust framework via proximal optimization that suppresses outlier noise while preserving meaningful gradient directions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ROOT achieves significantly improved robustness, with faster convergence and superior final performance compared to both Muon and Adam-based optimizers, particularly in noisy and non-convex scenarios. Our work establishes a new paradigm for developing robust and precise optimizers capable of handling the complexities of modern large-scale model training.
