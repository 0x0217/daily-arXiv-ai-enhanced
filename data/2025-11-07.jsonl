Today, we refer to data carriers for automatic\nmachines as oracles, but establishing a secure channel between these oracles\nand the real world still represents a challenge. Despite numerous efforts, this\nproblem remains mostly unsolved, and the recent advent of blockchain oracles\nhas added a layer of complexity because of the decentralization of blockchains.\nThis paper conceptually connects Delphic and modern blockchain oracles,\ndeveloping a comparative framework. Leveraging blockchain oracle taxonomy,\nlexical analysis is also performed on 167 Delphic queries to shed light on the\nrelationship between oracle answer quality and question type.

We present PublicAgent, a\nmulti-agent framework that addresses these limitations through decomposition\ninto specialized agents for intent clarification, dataset discovery, analysis,\nand reporting. This architecture maintains focused attention within agent\ncontexts and enables validation at each stage. Evaluation across five models\nand 50 queries derives five design principles for multi-agent LLM systems.\nFirst, specialization provides value independent of model strength--even the\nstrongest model shows 97.5% agent win rates, with benefits orthogonal to model\nscale. Second, agents divide into universal (discovery, analysis) and\nconditional (report, intent) categories. Universal agents show consistent\neffectiveness (std dev 12.4%) while conditional agents vary by model (std dev\n20.5%). Third, agents mitigate distinct failure modes--removing discovery or\nanalysis causes catastrophic failures (243-280 instances), while removing\nreport or intent causes quality degradation. Fourth, architectural benefits\npersist across task complexity with stable win rates (86-92% analysis, 84-94%\ndiscovery), indicating workflow management value rather than reasoning\nenhancement.

Given a\nproperty predictive model, in silico design typically involves training a\ngenerative model over the design space (e.g., protein sequence space) to\nconcentrate on designs with the desired properties. Distributional optimization\n-- which can be formalized as an estimation of distribution algorithm or as\nreinforcement learning policy optimization -- finds the generative model that\nmaximizes an objective function in expectation. Optimizing a distribution over\ndiscrete-valued designs is in general challenging because of the combinatorial\nnature of the design space.

We address this limitation by introducing NAP (Neural\nAggregator of Predictions), an attention-based model which learns to combine\nmultiple prediction streams using a tri-axial attention mechanism that captures\ntemporal, spatial, and predictor-level dependencies. NAP is trained to adapt to\ndifferent input dimensions. By aggregating outputs from frozen, pretrained\nsingle-channel models, NAP consistently outperforms individual predictors and\nsimple ensembles, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot generalization across\nmultiple datasets. While demonstrated in the context of automated sleep staging\nfrom polysomnography, the proposed approach could be extended to other\nmultimodal physiological applications."}

Building upon previous work that\ndemonstrated the strong expressiveness of ENNs with compact architectures, we\nnow emphasize their efficiency, interpretability and pruning capabilities. The\nDCT-based parameterization provides a structured and decorrelated\nrepresentation that reveals the functional role of each neuron and allows\ndirect identification of redundant components. Leveraging this property, we\npropose an efficient pruning strategy that removes unnecessary DCT coefficients\nwith negligible or no loss in performance. Experimental results across\nclassification and implicit neural representation tasks confirm that ENNs\nachieve state-of-the-art accuracy while maintaining a low number of parameters.\nFurthermore, up to 40% of the activation coefficients can be safely pruned,\nthanks to the orthogonality and bounded nature of the DCT basis. Overall, these\nfindings demonstrate that the ENN framework offers a principled integration of\nsignal processing concepts into neural network design, achieving a balanced\ntrade-off between expressiveness, compactness, and interpretability."}

These requirements\nseverely limit practical applicability, as many real-world scenarios provide\nonly state observations without corresponding actions and expert performance is\noften suboptimal. In this paper we introduce a deep implicit imitation\nreinforcement learning framework that addresses both limitations by combining\ndeep reinforcement learning with implicit imitation learning from\nobservation-only datasets. Our main algorithm, Deep Implicit Imitation\nQ-Network (DIIQN), employs an action inference mechanism that reconstructs\nexpert actions through online exploration and integrates a dynamic confidence\nmechanism that adaptively balances expert-guided and self-directed learning.\nThis enables the agent to leverage expert guidance for accelerated training\nwhile maintaining capacity to surpass suboptimal expert performance. We further\nextend our framework with a Heterogeneous Actions DIIQN (HA-DIIQN) algorithm to\ntackle scenarios where expert and agent possess different action sets, a\nchallenge previously unaddressed in the implicit imitation learning literature.\nHA-DIIQN introduces an infeasibility detection mechanism and a bridging\nprocedure identifying alternative pathways connecting agent capabilities to\nexpert guidance when direct action replication is impossible. Our experimental\nresults demonstrate that DIIQN achieves up to 130% higher episodic returns\ncompared to standard DQN, while consistently outperforming existing implicit\nimitation methods that cannot exceed expert performance. In heterogeneous\naction settings, HA-DIIQN learns up to 64% faster than baselines, leveraging\nexpert datasets unusable by conventional approaches. Extensive parameter\nsensitivity analysis reveals the framework's robustness across varying dataset\nsizes and hyperparameter configurations."}

Eight machine learning\nmodels are evaluated across three learning approaches: supervised learning\n(XGBoost, K-Nearest Neighbors (K- NN)), semi-supervised learning (Generative\nAdversarial Networks (GAN), Variational Autoencoders (VAE)), and unsupervised\nlearning (One-Class Support Vector Machine (SVM), Isolation Forest, Graph\nNeural Networks (GNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Autoencoders). The\ncomprehensive evaluation was conducted across multiple metrics like F1-score,\nprecision, recall, accuracy, ROC-AUC, computational efficiency. XGBoost\nachieved 99\\% accuracy with minimal computational overhead (0.04s) for anomaly\ndetection, while Isolation Forest balanced precision and recall effectively.\nLSTM Autoencoders underperformed with lower accuracy and higher latency.

Furthermore, the lack of\nexplainability of the resulting design solutions hampers widespread adoption of\nthe tools. To address these issues, a novel agentic AI framework for\nsample-efficient and explainable analog circuit sizing is presented.

As an exemplar, we demonstrate its application to the\naerodynamic optimization of 4-digit NACA airfoils.
