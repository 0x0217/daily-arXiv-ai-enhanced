While these agents offer powerful capabilities, their design exposes them to indirect prompt injection attacks embedded in untrusted web content, enabling adversaries to hijack agent behavior and violate user intent. Despite growing awareness of this threat, existing evaluations rely on fixed attack templates, manually selected injection surfaces, or narrowly scoped scenarios, limiting their ability to capture realistic, adaptive attacks encountered in practice. We present MUZZLE, an automated agentic framework for evaluating the security of web agents against indirect prompt injection attacks. MUZZLE utilizes the agent's trajectories to automatically identify high-salience injection surfaces, and adaptively generate context-aware malicious instructions that target violations of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Unlike prior approaches, MUZZLE adapts its attack strategy based on the agent's observed execution trajectory and iteratively refines attacks using feedback from failed executions. We evaluate MUZZLE across diverse web applications, user tasks, and agent configurations, demonstrating its ability to automatically and adaptively assess the security of web agents with minimal human intervention. Our results show that MUZZLE effectively discovers 37 new attacks on 4 web applications with 10 adversarial objectives that violate confidentiality, availability, or privacy properties. MUZZLE also identifies novel attack strategies, including 2 cross-application prompt injection attacks and an agent-tailored phishing scenario."}

Traditional security paradigms - log aggregation, perimeter defense, and post-hoc forensics - cannot protect systems where AI-driven actions are irreversible, execute at machine speed, and originate from potentially compromised orchestration layers. This paper introduces Autonomous Action Runtime Management (AARM), an open specification for securing AI-driven actions at runtime. AARM defines a runtime security system that intercepts actions before execution, accumulates session context, evaluates against policy and intent alignment, enforces authorization decisions, and records tamper-evident receipts for forensic reconstruction. We formalize a threat model addressing prompt injection, confused deputy attacks, data exfiltration, and intent drift. We introduce an action classification framework distinguishing forbidden, context-dependent deny, and context-dependent allow actions. We propose four implementation architectures - protocol gateway, SDK instrumentation, kernel eBPF, and vendor integration - with distinct trust properties, and specify minimum conformance requirements for AARM-compliant systems. AARM is model-agnostic, framework-agnostic, and vendor-neutral, treating action execution as the stable security boundary. This specification aims to establish industry-wide requirements before proprietary fragmentation forecloses interoperability."}

Empirical evidence indicates that high-dimensional embeddings tend to collapse into narrow cones, concentrating task-relevant semantics in a small subspace, while the majority of dimensions remain occupied by noise and spurious correlations. Such spectral imbalance and entanglement undermine model generalization. We propose Spectral Disentanglement and Enhancement (SDE), a novel framework that bridges the gap between the geometry of the embedded spaces and their spectral properties. Our approach leverages singular value decomposition to adaptively partition feature dimensions into strong signals that capture task-critical semantics, weak signals that reflect ancillary correlations, and noise representing irrelevant perturbations. A curriculum-based spectral enhancement strategy is then applied, selectively amplifying informative components with theoretical guarantees on training stability. Building upon the enhanced features, we further introduce a dual-domain contrastive loss that jointly optimizes alignment in both the feature and spectral spaces, effectively integrating spectral regularization into the training process and encouraging richer, more robust representations. Extensive experiments on large-scale multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that SDE consistently improves representation robustness and generalization, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. SDE integrates seamlessly with existing contrastive pipelines, offering an effective solution for multimodal representation learning."}

For tree ensembles, predictions are piecewise constant over a large collection of axis-aligned hyperrectangles, implying that an optimal counterfactual for a point corresponds to its projection onto the nearest rectangle with an alternative label under a chosen metric. Existing methods largely overlook this geometric structure, relying either on heuristics with no optimality guarantees or on mixed-integer programming formulations that do not scale to interactive use.\n  In this work, we revisit counterfactual generation through the lens of nearest-region search and introduce counterfactual maps, a global representation of recourse for tree ensembles. Leveraging the fact that any tree ensemble can be compressed into an equivalent partition of labeled hyperrectangles, we cast counterfactual search as the problem of identifying the generalized Voronoi cell associated with the nearest rectangle of an alternative label. This leads to an exact, amortized algorithm based on volumetric k-dimensional (KD) trees, which performs branch-and-bound nearest-region queries with explicit optimality certificates and sublinear average query time after a one-time preprocessing phase.\n  Our experimental analyses on several real datasets drawn from high-stakes application domains show that this approach delivers globally optimal counterfactual explanations with millisecond-level latency, achieving query times that are orders of magnitude faster than existing exact, cold-start optimization methods."}

The problem is not inadequate alignment or insufficient guardrails, it is architectural: autoregressive language models process all tokens uniformly, making deterministic command--data separation unattainable through training alone. We argue that deterministic, architectural enforcement, not probabilistic learned behavior, is a necessary condition for trustworthy AI-assisted science. We introduce the Trinity Defense Architecture, which enforces security through three mechanisms: action governance via a finite action calculus with reference-monitor enforcement, information-flow control via mandatory access labels preventing cross-scope leakage, and privilege separation isolating perception from execution. We show that without unforgeable provenance and deterministic mediation, the ``Lethal Trifecta'' (untrusted inputs, privileged data access, external action capability) turns authorization security into an exploit-discovery problem: training-based defenses may reduce empirical attack rates but cannot provide deterministic guarantees. The ML community must recognize that alignment is insufficient for authorization security, and that architectural mediation is required before agentic AI can be safely deployed in consequential scientific domains."}

Maintaining these resources requires expert curators to search relevant papers, reconcile evidence across documents, and produce ontology-grounded annotations - a workflow that existing benchmarks, focused on isolated subtasks like named entity recognition or relation extraction, do not capture. We present FlyBench to evaluate AI agents on end-to-end agentic ontology curation from scientific literature. Given only a gene symbol, agents must search and read from a corpus of 16,898 full-text papers to produce structured annotations: Gene Ontology terms describing function, expression patterns, and historical synonyms linking decades of nomenclature. The benchmark includes 7,397 expert-curated annotations across 100 genes drawn from FlyBase, the Drosophila (fruit fly) knowledge base. We evaluate four baseline agent architectures: memorization, fixed pipeline, single-agent, and multi-agent. We find that architectural choices significantly impact performance, with multi-agent designs outperforming simpler alternatives, yet scaling backbone models yields diminishing returns. All baselines leave substantial room for improvement. Our analysis surfaces several findings to guide future development; for example, agents primarily use retrieval to confirm parametric knowledge rather than discover new information. We hope FlyBench will drive progress on retrieval-augmented scientific reasoning, a capability with broad applications across scientific domains."}

Experiments on Reasoning Gym and GSM8K show that this latent integration is competitive with strong single-model RLVR baselines. Ablations further reveal a dual mechanism of expert utilization: for simpler arithmetic domains, performance gains can largely be explained by static expert preferences, whereas more challenging settings induce increasingly concentrated and structured expert attention over training, indicating emergent specialization in how the router connects to relevant experts. Overall, hidden-state collaboration provides a compact mechanism for leveraging frozen experts, while offering an observational window into expert utilization patterns and their evolution under RLVR."}

We conceptualize this period as an early-stage crystallization phase, where oversight expectations form before norms reach equilibrium.\n  Using topic modeling in a shared comparison space, a coarse-grained oversight-theme abstraction, engagement-weighted salience, and divergence tests, we show the communities are strongly separable (JSD =0.418, cosine =0.372, permutation $p=0.0005$).

Instance-conditional routing can break this ceiling, but is fragile because shifts can mislead routing and perturbations can make routing fluctuate. We capture these effects via two decompositions separating coverage vs selection, and base sensitivity vs fluctuation amplification. Based on these insights, we propose STEM-GNN, a pretrain-then-finetune framework with a mixture-of-experts encoder for diverse computation paths, a vector-quantized token interface to stabilize encoder-to-head signals, and a Lipschitz-regularized head to bound output amplification. Across nine node, link, and graph benchmarks, STEM-GNN achieves a stronger three-way balance, improving robustness to degree/homophily shifts and to feature/edge corruptions while remaining competitive on clean graphs."}

We introduce AgentAuditor, which replaces voting with a path search over a Reasoning Tree that explicitly represents agreements and divergences among agent traces. AgentAuditor resolves conflicts by comparing reasoning branches at critical divergence points, turning global adjudication into efficient, localized verification. We further propose Anti-Consensus Preference Optimization (ACPO), which trains the adjudicator on majority-failure cases and rewards evidence-based minority selections over popular errors. AgentAuditor is agnostic to MAS setting, and we find across 5 popular settings that it yields up to 5% absolute accuracy improvement over a majority vote, and up to 3% over using LLM-as-Judge."}

Through extensive experiments on language models, we demonstrate that Shampoo achieves higher token efficiency than Muon, mirroring Adam's advantage over Signum. We show that Shampoo's update applied to weight matrices can be decomposed into an adapted Muon update. Consistent with this, Shampoo's benefits can be exclusively attributed to its application to weight matrices, challenging interpretations agnostic to parameter shapes. This admits a new perspective that also avoids shortcomings of related interpretations based on variance adaptation and whitening: rather than enforcing semi-orthogonality as in spectral descent, Shampoo's updates are time-averaged semi-orthogonal in expectation."}

At the Olympiad level, diagrams are often constitutive rather than illustrative, containing essential constraints, such as boundary conditions and spatial symmetries, that are absent from the text. To bridge this visual-logical gap, we introduce P1-VL, a family of open-source vision-language models engineered for advanced scientific reasoning.

The main focus of PB is designing rules, functions that return feasible budget allocations for a set of projects subject to some budget constraint. Designing PB rules that optimize both utility and fairness objectives based on agent preferences had been challenging due to the extensive domain knowledge required and the proven trade-off between the two notions. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly employed for automated algorithmic design. Given the resemblance of PB rules to algorithms for classical knapsack problems, in this paper, we introduce a novel framework, named LLMRule, that addresses the limitations of existing works by incorporating LLMs into an evolutionary search procedure for automating the design of PB rules. Our experimental results, evaluated on more than 600 real-world PB instances obtained from the U.S., Canada, Poland, and the Netherlands with different representations of agent preferences, demonstrate that the LLM-generated rules generally outperform existing handcrafted rules in terms of overall utility while still maintaining a similar degree of fairness."}

To address these challenges, we propose SpotAgent, a framework that formalizes geo-localization into an agentic reasoning process that leverages expert-level reasoning to synergize visual interpretation with tool-assisted verification. SpotAgent actively explores and verifies visual cues by leveraging external tools (e.g., web search, maps) through a ReAct diagram. We introduce a 3-stage post-training pipeline starting with a Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) stage for basic alignment, followed by an Agentic Cold Start phase utilizing high-quality trajectories synthesized via a Multi-Agent framework, aiming to instill tool-calling expertise.

Tabular foundation models such as TabPFN overcome this computational hurdle by leveraging in-context learning, so each conditional expectation can be approximated without any re-training. In this paper, we compute Shapley values with multiple variants of TabPFN and compare their performance with state-of-the-art methods on both simulated and real datasets. In most cases, TabPFN yields the best performance; where it does not, it is only marginally worse than the best method, at a fraction of the runtime.

However, due to the autoregressive, step-by-step generation paradigm, existing CoT methods suffer from two fundamental limitations. First, the reasoning process is highly sensitive to early decisions: once an initial error is introduced, it tends to propagate and amplify through subsequent steps, while the lack of a global coordination and revision mechanism makes such errors difficult to correct, ultimately leading to distorted reasoning chains. Second, current CoT approaches lack structured analysis techniques for filtering redundant reasoning and extracting key reasoning features, resulting in unstable reasoning processes and limited interpretability. To address these issues, we propose GHS-TDA. GHS-TDA first constructs a semantically enriched global hypothesis graph to aggregate, align, and coordinate multiple candidate reasoning paths, thereby providing alternative global correction routes when local reasoning fails. It then applies topological data analysis based on persistent homology to capture stable multi-scale structures, remove redundancy and inconsistencies, and extract a more reliable reasoning skeleton. By jointly leveraging reasoning diversity and topological stability, GHS-TDA achieves self-adaptive convergence, produces high-confidence and interpretable reasoning paths, and consistently outperforms strong baselines in terms of both accuracy and robustness across multiple reasoning benchmarks."}

Moreover, commonly used graph-level readout and reconstruction schemes fail to capture global structural information, limiting the robustness of learned representations. In this work, we propose a unified diffusion-based pretraining framework that addresses both limitations. First, diffusion is designed to guide structure-aware dropping and masking strategies, preserving brain graph semantics while maintaining effective pretraining diversity. Second, diffusion enables topology-aware graph-level readout and node-level global reconstruction by allowing graph embeddings and masked nodes to aggregate information from globally related regions.

Popular UED methods focus on Open-Endedness, where teacher algorithms rely on stochastic processes for infinite generation of useful environments. This assumption becomes impractical in resource-constrained scenarios where teacher-student interaction opportunities are limited. To address this challenge, we introduce a hierarchical Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework for environment design. Our framework features a teacher agent that leverages student policy representations derived from discovered evaluation environments, enabling it to generate training environments based on the student's capabilities. To improve efficiency, we incorporate a generative model that augments the teacher's training dataset with synthetic data, reducing the need for teacher-student interactions. In experiments across several domains, we show that our method outperforms baseline approaches while requiring fewer teacher-student interactions in a single episode. The results suggest the applicability of our approach in settings where training opportunities are limited."}

However, the inherent capacity gap often limits the performance of student networks. Inspired by the expressiveness of pretrained teacher networks, a compelling research question arises: is there a type of network that can not only inherit the teacher's structure but also maximize the inheritance of its knowledge? Furthermore, how does the performance of such an inheriting network compare to that of student networks, all benefiting from the same teacher network? To further explore this question, we propose InherNet, a neural network inheritance method that performs asymmetric low-rank decomposition on the teacher's weights and reconstructs a lightweight yet expressive network without significant architectural disruption. By leveraging Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for initialization to ensure the inheritance of principal knowledge, InherNet effectively balances depth, width, and compression efficiency. Experimental results across unimodal and multimodal tasks demonstrate that InherNet achieves higher performance compared to student networks of similar parameter sizes. Our findings reveal a promising direction for future research in efficient model compression beyond traditional distillation."}

Recent efforts leverage Large Language Model (LLM) agents to automate this task, yet existing systems exhibit low detection accuracy even with capable models, and current evaluation frameworks assess only final answer correctness without revealing why the agent's reasoning failed. This paper presents a process level failure analysis of LLM-based RCA agents. We execute the full OpenRCA benchmark across five LLM models, producing 1,675 agent runs, and classify observed failures into 12 pitfall types across intra-agent reasoning, inter-agent communication, and agent-environment interaction. Our analysis reveals that the most prevalent pitfalls, notably hallucinated data interpretation and incomplete exploration, persist across all models regardless of capability tier, indicating that these failures originate from the shared agent architecture rather than from individual model limitations. Controlled mitigation experiments further show that prompt engineering alone cannot resolve the dominant pitfalls, whereas enriching the inter-agent communication protocol reduces communication-related failures by up to 15 percentage points. The pitfall taxonomy and diagnostic methodology developed in this work provide a foundation for designing more reliable autonomous agents for cloud RCA."}

Existing training frameworks primarily optimize for single-agent scenarios and fail to address the unique system-level challenges of MARL, including rollout-training synchronization barriers, rollout load imbalance, and training resource underutilization. To bridge this gap, we propose FlexMARL, the first end-to-end training framework that holistically optimizes rollout, training, and their orchestration for large-scale LLM-based MARL. Specifically, FlexMARL introduces the joint orchestrator to manage data flow under the rollout-training disaggregated architecture. Building upon the experience store, a novel micro-batch driven asynchronous pipeline eliminates the synchronization barriers while providing strong consistency guarantees. Rollout engine adopts a parallel sampling scheme combined with hierarchical load balancing, which adapts to skewed inter/intra-agent request patterns. Training engine achieves on-demand hardware binding through agent-centric resource allocation. The training states of different agents are swapped via unified and location-agnostic communication. Empirical results on a large-scale production cluster demonstrate that FlexMARL achieves up to 7.3x speedup and improves hardware utilization by up to 5.6x compared to existing frameworks."}

We propose Differential Reasoning Learning (DRL), a framework that improves clinical agents by learning from reasoning discrepancies. From reference reasoning rationales (e.g., physician-authored clinical rationale, clinical guidelines, or outputs from more capable models) and the agent's free-form chain-of-thought (CoT), DRL extracts reasoning graphs as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and performs a clinically weighted graph edit distance (GED)-based discrepancy analysis. An LLM-as-a-judge aligns semantically equivalent nodes and diagnoses discrepancies between graphs. These graph-level discrepancy diagnostics are converted into natural-language instructions and stored in a Differential Reasoning Knowledge Base (DR-KB). At inference, we retrieve top-$k$ instructions via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to augment the agent prompt and patch likely logic gaps. Evaluation on open medical question answering (QA) benchmarks and a Return Visit Admissions (RVA) prediction task from internal clinical data demonstrates gains over baselines, improving both final-answer accuracy and reasoning fidelity. Ablation studies confirm gains from infusing reference reasoning rationales and the top-$k$ retrieval strategy. Clinicians' review of the output provides further assurance of the approach. Together, results suggest that DRL supports more reliable clinical decision-making in complex reasoning scenarios and offers a practical mechanism for deployment under limited token budgets."}

In this paper, we introduce MonoSoup, a simple, data-free, hyperparameter-free, post-hoc method that achieves a strong ID-OOD balance using only a single checkpoint. Our method applies Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to each layer's update and decomposes it into high-energy directions that capture task-specific adaptation and low-energy directions that introduce noise but may still encode residual signals useful for robustness. MonoSoup then uses entropy-based effective rank to automatically re-weigh these components with layer-wise coefficients that account for the spectral and geometric structure of the model. Experiments on CLIP models fine-tuned on ImageNet and evaluated under natural distribution shifts, as well as on Qwen language models tested on mathematical reasoning and multiple-choice benchmarks, show that this plug-and-play approach is a practical and effective alternative to multi-checkpoint methods, retaining much of their benefits without their computational overhead."}

This problem is exacerbated when a human user wishes to either guide or interact with the agent in natural language. Although the use of Language Models (LMs) is the default choice, as an AI tool, they struggle with tasks involving physics. The LM's capability for physical reasoning is learned from observational data, rather than being grounded in simulation. A common approach is to include simulation traces as context, but this suffers from poor scalability as simulation traces contain larger volumes of fine-grained numerical and semantic data. In this paper, we propose a natural language guided method to discover coarse-grained patterns (e.g., 'rigid-body collision', 'stable support', etc.) from detailed simulation logs. Specifically, we synthesize programs that operate on simulation logs and map them to a series of high level activated patterns. We show, through two physics benchmarks, that this annotated representation of the simulation log is more amenable to natural language reasoning about physical systems. We demonstrate how this method enables LMs to generate effective reward programs from goals specified in natural language, which may be used within the context of planning or supervised learning."}

To establish a framework for certified natural language generation, we formalize two security properties: stability (robustness to any change in generation) and validity (robustness to targeted, harmful changes in generation). We introduce Targeted Partition Aggregation (TPA), the first algorithm to certify validity/targeted attacks by computing the minimum poisoning budget needed to induce a specific harmful class, token, or phrase. Further, we extend TPA to provide tighter guarantees for multi-turn generations using mixed integer linear programming (MILP). Empirically, we demonstrate TPA's effectiveness across diverse settings including: certifying validity of agent tool-calling when adversaries modify up to 0.5% of the dataset and certifying 8-token stability horizons in preference-based alignment. Though inference-time latency remains an open challenge, our contributions enable certified deployment of language models in security-critical applications."}

This single-minded assumption prevents models from reaching the next level of intelligence. To address this limitation, we propose Chain of Mindset (CoM), a training-free agentic framework that enables step-level adaptive mindset orchestration. CoM decomposes reasoning into four functionally heterogeneous mindsets: Spatial, Convergent, Divergent, and Algorithmic. A Meta-Agent dynamically selects the optimal mindset based on the evolving reasoning state, while a bidirectional Context Gate filters cross-module information flow to maintain effectiveness and efficiency.

While reinforcement learning offers a powerful framework for training agents to master complex skills, it typically relies on hand-designed reward functions. This is infeasible for open-ended skill discovery, where the set of meaningful skills is not known a priori. While recent methods have shown promising results towards automating reward function design, they remain limited to refining rewards for pre-defined tasks. To address this limitation, we introduce Continuous Open-ended Discovery and Evolution of Skills as Hierarchical Reward Programs (CODE-SHARP), a novel framework leveraging Foundation Models (FM) to open-endedly expand and refine a hierarchical skill archive, structured as a directed graph of executable reward functions in code. We show that a goal-conditioned agent trained exclusively on the rewards generated by the discovered SHARP skills learns to solve increasingly long-horizon goals in the Craftax environment. When composed by a high-level FM-based planner, the discovered skills enable a single goal-conditioned agent to solve complex, long-horizon tasks, outperforming both pretrained agents and task-specific expert policies by over $134$% on average.

Using this pipeline, we scale to 1,000 environments covering everyday scenarios, in which agents can interact with rich toolsets (35 tools per environment on average) and obtain high-quality observations.

Such spectral imbalance and entanglement undermine model generalization. We propose Spectral Disentanglement and Enhancement (SDE), a novel framework that bridges the gap between the geometry of the embedded spaces and their spectral properties. Our approach leverages singular value decomposition to adaptively partition feature dimensions into strong signals that capture task-critical semantics, weak signals that reflect ancillary correlations, and noise representing irrelevant perturbations. A curriculum-based spectral enhancement strategy is then applied, selectively amplifying informative components with theoretical guarantees on training stability. Building upon the enhanced features, we further introduce a dual-domain contrastive loss that jointly optimizes alignment in both the feature and spectral spaces, effectively integrating spectral regularization into the training process and encouraging richer, more robust representations. Extensive experiments on large-scale multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that SDE consistently improves representation robustness and generalization, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Empirical results show that DDQN consistently avoids negative transfer under the examined setup and maintains learning dynamics comparable to baseline performance in the target environment. In contrast, Dueling DQN consistently exhibits negative transfer under identical conditions, characterized by degraded rewards and unstable optimization behavior.

MUZZLE utilizes the agent's trajectories to automatically identify high-salience injection surfaces, and adaptively generate context-aware malicious instructions that target violations of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

We evaluate MUZZLE across diverse web applications, user tasks, and agent configurations, demonstrating its ability to automatically and adaptively assess the security of web agents with minimal human intervention. Our results show that MUZZLE effectively discovers 37 new attacks on 4 web applications with 10 adversarial objectives that violate confidentiality, availability, or privacy properties.

To address these issues, we propose PlugSI, a plug-and-play framework that refines test-time graph through two key innovations. First, we design an Unknown Topology Adapter (UTA) that adapts to the new graph structure of each small-batch at test-time, enhancing the generalization of SI pre-trained models. Second, we introduce a Temporal Balance Adapter (TBA) that maintains a stable historical consensus to guide UTA adaptation and prevent drifting caused by noise in the current batch. Empirically, extensive experiments demonstrate PlugSI can be seamlessly integrated into existing graph-based SI methods and provide significant improvement (e.g., a 10.81% reduction in MAE)."}

While in specific settings, Shampoo and Muon reduce to spectral descent analogous to how Adam and Signum reduce to sign descent, their general relationship and relative data efficiency under controlled settings remain unclear. Through extensive experiments on language models, we demonstrate that Shampoo achieves higher token efficiency than Muon, mirroring Adam's advantage over Signum. We show that Shampoo's update applied to weight matrices can be decomposed into an adapted Muon update. Consistent with this, Shampoo's benefits can be exclusively attributed to its application to weight matrices, challenging interpretations agnostic to parameter shapes. This admits a new perspective that also avoids shortcomings of related interpretations based on variance adaptation and whitening: rather than enforcing semi-orthogonality as in spectral descent, Shampoo's updates are time-averaged semi-orthogonal in expectation."}

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative by leveraging semantic reasoning to generate unbounded operators, existing methods fail to construct free-form FE pipelines, remaining confined to isolated subtasks such as feature generation. Most importantly, they are rarely optimized jointly with hyperparameter optimization (HPO) of the ML model, leading to greedy \"FE-then-HPO\" workflows that cannot capture strong FE-HPO interactions. In this paper, we present CoFEH, a collaborative framework that interleaves LLM-based FE and Bayesian HPO for robust end-to-end AutoML. CoFEH uses an LLM-driven FE optimizer powered by Tree of Thought (ToT) to explore flexible FE pipelines, a Bayesian optimization (BO) module to solve HPO, and a dynamic optimizer selector that realizes interleaved optimization by adaptively scheduling FE and HPO steps. Crucially, we introduce a mutual conditioning mechanism that shares context between LLM and BO, enabling mutually informed decisions. Experiments show that CoFEH not only outperforms traditional and LLM-based FE baselines, but also achieves superior end-to-end performance under joint optimization."}

While this minimizes resource usage for on-device applications, it makes agents notoriously sample-inefficient, since value-based losses alone struggle to extract meaningful representations from transient data. We propose extending Self-Predictive Representations (SPR) to the streaming pipeline to maximize the utility of every observed frame. However, due to the highly correlated samples induced by the streaming regime, naively applying this auxiliary loss results in training instabilities. Thus, we introduce orthogonal gradient updates relative to the momentum target and resolve gradient conflicts arising from streaming-specific optimizers. Validated across the Atari, MinAtar, and Octax suites, our approach systematically outperforms existing streaming baselines. Latent-space analysis, including t-SNE visualizations and effective-rank measurements, confirms that our method learns significantly richer representations, bridging the performance gap caused by the absence of a replay buffer, while remaining efficient enough to train on just a few CPU cores."}

Traditional security paradigms - log aggregation, perimeter defense, and post-hoc forensics - cannot protect systems where AI-driven actions are irreversible, execute at machine speed, and originate from potentially compromised orchestration layers. This paper introduces Autonomous Action Runtime Management (AARM), an open specification for securing AI-driven actions at runtime. AARM defines a runtime security system that intercepts actions before execution, accumulates session context, evaluates against policy and intent alignment, enforces authorization decisions, and records tamper-evident receipts for forensic reconstruction. We formalize a threat model addressing prompt injection, confused deputy attacks, data exfiltration, and intent drift. We introduce an action classification framework distinguishing forbidden, context-dependent deny, and context-dependent allow actions. We propose four implementation architectures - protocol gateway, SDK instrumentation, kernel eBPF, and vendor integration - with distinct trust properties, and specify minimum conformance requirements for AARM-compliant systems. AARM is model-agnostic, framework-agnostic, and vendor-neutral, treating action execution as the stable security boundary. This specification aims to establish industry-wide requirements before proprietary fragmentation forecloses interoperability."}

Moreover, commonly used graph-level readout and reconstruction schemes fail to capture global structural information, limiting the robustness of learned representations. In this work, we propose a unified diffusion-based pretraining framework that addresses both limitations. First, diffusion is designed to guide structure-aware dropping and masking strategies, preserving brain graph semantics while maintaining effective pretraining diversity. Second, diffusion enables topology-aware graph-level readout and node-level global reconstruction by allowing graph embeddings and masked nodes to aggregate information from globally related regions. Extensive experiments across multiple neuroimaging datasets with over 25,000 subjects and 60,000 scans involving various mental disorders and brain atlases demonstrate consistent performance improvements."}

However, standard diffusion transformers fail to converge on these representations directly. While recent work attributes this to a capacity bottleneck proposing computationally expensive width scaling of diffusion transformers we demonstrate that the failure is fundamentally geometric. We identify Geometric Interference as the root cause: standard Euclidean flow matching forces probability paths through the low-density interior of the hyperspherical feature space of representation encoders, rather than following the manifold surface. To resolve this, we propose Riemannian Flow Matching with Jacobi Regularization (RJF). By constraining the generative process to the manifold geodesics and correcting for curvature-induced error propagation, RJF enables standard Diffusion Transformer architectures to converge without width scaling. Our method RJF enables the standard DiT-B architecture (131M parameters) to converge effectively, achieving an FID of 3.37 where prior methods fail to converge.

Using this pipeline, we scale to 1,000 environments covering everyday scenarios, in which agents can interact with rich toolsets (35 tools per environment on average) and obtain high-quality observations. Notably, these environments are code-driven and backed by databases, providing more reliable and consistent state transitions than environments simulated by LLMs. Moreover, they enable more efficient agent interaction compared with collecting trajectories from realistic environments. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this resource, we perform large-scale reinforcement learning for multi-turn tool-use agents. Thanks to the fully executable environments and accessible database states, we can also design reliable reward functions. Experiments on three benchmarks show that training exclusively in synthetic environments, rather than benchmark-specific ones, yields strong out-of-distribution generalization.

Gradient-Preserving Clipping is a primary factor influencing these dynamics, but existing mitigation strategies are largely static and lack a framework connecting clipping mechanisms to precise entropy control. This paper proposes reshaping entropy control in RL from the perspective of Gradient-Preserving Clipping. We first theoretically and empirically verify the contributions of specific importance sampling ratio regions to entropy growth and reduction. Leveraging these findings, we introduce a novel regulation mechanism using dynamic clipping threshold to precisely manage entropy. Furthermore, we design and evaluate dynamic entropy control strategies, including increase-then-decrease, decrease-increase-decrease, and oscillatory decay.

This paper presents a controlled empirical study examining how architectural differences between Double Deep Q-Networks (DDQN) and Dueling DQN influence transfer behavior across environments. Using CartPole as a source task and LunarLander as a structurally distinct target task, we evaluate a fixed layer-wise representation transfer protocol under identical hyperparameters and training conditions, with baseline agents trained from scratch used to contextualize transfer effects. Empirical results show that DDQN consistently avoids negative transfer under the examined setup and maintains learning dynamics comparable to baseline performance in the target environment. In contrast, Dueling DQN consistently exhibits negative transfer under identical conditions, characterized by degraded rewards and unstable optimization behavior. Statistical analysis across multiple random seeds confirms a significant performance gap under transfer. These findings suggest that architectural inductive bias is strongly associated with robustness to cross-environment transfer in value-based deep reinforcement learning under the examined transfer protocol."}
