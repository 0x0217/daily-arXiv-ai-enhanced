Existing methods struggle with this: single-agent\nsystems are quickly overwhelmed by large, heterogeneous files in the large data\nlakes, while multi-agent systems designed based on a master-slave paradigm\ndepend on a rigid central controller for task allocation that requires precise\nknowledge of each sub-agent's capabilities. To address these limitations, we\npropose a novel multi-agent communication paradigm inspired by the blackboard\narchitecture for traditional AI models. In this framework, a central agent\nposts requests to a shared blackboard, and autonomous subordinate agents --\neither responsible for a partition of the data lake or general information\nretrieval -- volunteer to respond based on their capabilities. This design\nimproves scalability and flexibility by eliminating the need for a central\ncoordinator to have prior knowledge of all sub-agents' expertise. We evaluate\nour method on three benchmarks that require explicit data discovery: KramaBench\nand modified versions of DS-Bench and DA-Code to incorporate data discovery.\nExperimental results demonstrate that the blackboard architecture substantially\noutperforms baselines, including RAG and the master-slave multi-agent paradigm,\nachieving between 13% to 57% relative improvement in end-to-end task success\nand up to a 9% relative gain in F1 score for data discovery over the\nbest-performing baselines across both proprietary and open-source LLMs. Our\nfindings establish the blackboard paradigm as a scalable and generalizable\ncommunication framework for multi-agent systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub370\uc774\ud130

Unlike\nclassical equilibrium models that limit heterogeneity for tractability, or\ntraditional agent-based models (ABMs) that rely on hand-crafted decision rules,\nSimCity enables flexible, adaptive behavior with transparent natural-language\nreasoning. Within SimCity, four core agent types (households, firms, a central\nbank, and a government) deliberate and participate in a frictional labor\nmarket, a heterogeneous goods market, and a financial market. Furthermore, a\nVision-Language Model (VLM) determines the geographic placement of new firms\nand renders a mapped virtual city, allowing us to study both macroeconomic\nregularities and urban expansion dynamics within a unified environment.

These methods fail to capture the\nemergent social and cognitive dynamics that arise when agents communicate,\npersuade, and collaborate in interactive environments. To address this gap, we\nintroduce a novel evaluation framework that uses multi-agent debate as a\ncontrolled \"social laboratory\" to discover and quantify these behaviors. In our\nframework, LLM-based agents, instantiated with distinct personas and\nincentives, deliberate on a wide range of challenging topics under the\nsupervision of an LLM moderator. Our analysis, enabled by a new suite of\npsychometric and semantic metrics, reveals several key findings. Across\nhundreds of debates, we uncover a powerful and robust emergent tendency for\nagents to seek consensus, consistently reaching high semantic agreement ({\\mu}\n> 0.88) even without explicit instruction and across sensitive topics. We show\nthat assigned personas induce stable, measurable psychometric profiles,\nparticularly in cognitive effort, and that the moderators persona can\nsignificantly alter debate outcomes by structuring the environment, a key\nfinding for external AI alignment. This work provides a blueprint for a new\nclass of dynamic, psychometrically grounded evaluation protocols designed for\nthe agentic setting, offering a crucial methodology for understanding and\nshaping the social behaviors of the next generation of AI agents.

To address these issues, we present the Cyber Academia-Chemical\nEngineering (CA-ChemE) system, a living digital town that enables self-directed\nresearch evolution and emergent scientific discovery through multi-agent\ncollaboration. By integrating domain-specific knowledge bases, knowledge\nenhancement technologies, and collaboration agents, the system successfully\nconstructs an intelligent ecosystem capable of deep professional reasoning and\nefficient interdisciplinary collaboration. Our findings demonstrate that\nknowledge base-enabled enhancement mechanisms improved dialogue quality scores\nby 10-15% on average across all seven expert agents, fundamentally ensuring\ntechnical judgments are grounded in verifiable scientific evidence.

At\nthe same time, various methods have been developed to detect general prompt\ninjection attacks, but none have been systematically evaluated for web agents.\nIn this work, we bridge this gap by presenting the first comprehensive\nbenchmark study on detecting prompt injection attacks targeting web agents. We\nbegin by introducing a fine-grained categorization of such attacks based on the\nthreat model. We then construct datasets containing both malicious and benign\nsamples: malicious text segments generated by different attacks, benign text\nsegments from four categories, malicious images produced by attacks, and benign\nimages from two categories. Next, we systematize both text-based and\nimage-based detection methods. Finally, we evaluate their performance across\nmultiple scenarios. Our key findings show that while some detectors can\nidentify attacks that rely on explicit textual instructions or visible image\nperturbations with moderate to high accuracy, they largely fail against attacks\nthat omit explicit instructions or employ imperceptible perturbations.

Benchmarking on\n50 curated papers shows that GPT-4.1 achieves the highest accuracy (F1 = 0.91\nfor thermoelectric properties and 0.82 for structural fields), while GPT-4.1\nMini delivers nearly comparable performance (F1 = 0.89 and 0.81) at a fraction\nof the cost, enabling practical large scale deployment. Applying this workflow,\nwe curated 27,822 temperature resolved property records with normalized units,\nspanning figure of merit (ZT), Seebeck coefficient, conductivity, resistivity,\npower factor, and thermal conductivity, together with structural attributes\nsuch as crystal class, space group, and doping strategy. Dataset analysis\nreproduces known thermoelectric trends, such as the superior performance of\nalloys over oxides and the advantage of p-type doping, while also surfacing\nbroader structure-property correlations. To facilitate community access, we\nrelease an interactive web explorer with semantic filters, numeric queries, and\nCSV export. This study delivers the largest LLM-curated thermoelectric dataset\nto date, provides a reproducible and cost-profiled extraction pipeline, and\nestablishes a foundation for scalable, data-driven materials discovery beyond\nthermoelectrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 10,000\uac1c\uc758 \uacfc\ud559 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5f4\uc804\ub3c4 \ubc0f \uad6c\uc870\uc801

Prior evaluations emphasize refusal or harmful-text detection,\nleaving open whether agents actually compile and run malicious programs. We\npresent JAWS-BENCH (Jailbreaks Across WorkSpaces), a benchmark spanning three\nescalating workspace regimes that mirror attacker capability: empty (JAWS-0),\nsingle-file (JAWS-1), and multi-file (JAWS-M). We pair this with a\nhierarchical, executable-aware Judge Framework that tests (i) compliance, (ii)\nattack success, (iii) syntactic correctness, and (iv) runtime executability,\nmoving beyond refusal to measure deployable harm. Using seven LLMs from five\nfamilies as backends, we find that under prompt-only conditions in JAWS-0, code\nagents accept 61% of attacks on average; 58% are harmful, 52% parse, and 27%\nrun end-to-end. Moving to single-file regime in JAWS-1 drives compliance to ~\n100% for capable models and yields a mean ASR (Attack Success Rate) ~ 71%; the\nmulti-file regime (JAWS-M) raises mean ASR to ~ 75%, with 32% instantly\ndeployable attack code.

While prior work has focused on these\ncollaborative settings, adversarial interactions are equally critical for\nreal-world applications such as pursuit-evasion, security, and competitive\nmanipulation. In this work, we extend the IsaacLab framework to support\nscalable training of adversarial policies in high-fidelity physics simulations.\nWe introduce a suite of adversarial MARL environments featuring heterogeneous\nagents with asymmetric goals and capabilities. Our platform integrates a\ncompetitive variant of Heterogeneous Agent Reinforcement Learning with Proximal\nPolicy Optimization (HAPPO), enabling efficient training and evaluation under\nadversarial dynamics.

Specifically, even on simple jigsaw tasks,\nexisting VLMs perform near randomly, revealing deficiencies in core perception\nand reasoning capabilities. While high-quality vision-language data can enhance\nthese capabilities, its scarcity and limited scalability impose significant\nconstraints. To address this, we propose AGILE, an Agentic jiGsaw Interaction\nLearning for Enhancing visual perception and reasoning in VLMs. AGILE\nformulates jigsaw solving as an interactive process, enabling the model to\nprogressively engage with the environment. At each step, the model generates\nexecutable code to perform an action based on the current state, while the\nenvironment provides fine-grained visual feedback to guide task completion.\nThrough this iterative cycle of observation and interaction, the model\nincrementally improves its perceptual and reasoning capabilities via\nexploration and feedback. Experimental results show that AGILE not only\nsubstantially boosts performance on jigsaw tasks of varying complexity (e.g.,\nincreasing accuracy from 9.5% to 82.8% under the 2 $\\times$ 2 setting) but also\ndemonstrates strong generalization across 9 general vision tasks, achieving an\naverage improvement of 3.1%. These results indicate notable enhancements in\nboth perceptual and reasoning abilities. This work opens a new avenue for\nadvancing reasoning and generalization in multimodal models and provides an\nefficient, scalable solution to the scarcity of multimodal reinforcement\nlearning data.

This position paper argues that the privacy landscape of LLM\nsystems extends far beyond training data extraction, encompassing risks from\ndata collection practices, inference-time context leakage, autonomous agent\ncapabilities, and the democratization of surveillance through deep inference\nattacks. We present a comprehensive taxonomy of privacy risks across the LLM\nlifecycle -- from data collection through deployment -- and demonstrate through\ncase studies how current privacy frameworks fail to address these multifaceted\nthreats. Through a longitudinal analysis of 1,322 AI/ML privacy papers\npublished at leading conferences over the past decade (2016--2025), we reveal\nthat while memorization receives outsized attention in technical research, the\nmost pressing privacy harms lie elsewhere, where current technical approaches\noffer little traction and viable paths forward remain unclear.

We introduce\nMEMTRACK, a benchmark designed to evaluate long-term memory and state tracking\nin multi-platform agent environments. MEMTRACK models realistic organizational\nworkflows by integrating asynchronous events across multiple communication and\nproductivity platforms such as Slack, Linear and Git. Each benchmark instance\nprovides a chronologically platform-interleaved timeline, with noisy,\nconflicting, cross-referring information as well as potential\ncodebase/file-system comprehension and exploration. Consequently, our benchmark\ntests memory capabilities such as acquistion, selection and conflict\nresolution. We curate the MEMTRACK dataset through both manual expert driven\ndesign and scalable agent based synthesis, generating ecologically valid\nscenarios grounded in real world software development processes. We introduce\npertinent metrics for Correctness, Efficiency, and Redundancy that capture the\neffectiveness of memory mechanisms beyond simple QA performance.

This paper studies how adversarial\nattacks targeting an ML component can degrade or bypass an entire\nproduction-grade malware detection system, performing a case study analysis of\nGmail's pipeline where file-type identification relies on a ML model.\n  The malware detection pipeline in use by Gmail contains a machine learning\nmodel that routes each potential malware sample to a specialized malware\nclassifier to improve accuracy and performance. This model, called Magika, has\nbeen open sourced. By designing adversarial examples that fool Magika, we can\ncause the production malware service to incorrectly route malware to an\nunsuitable malware detector thereby increasing our chance of evading detection.\nSpecifically, by changing just 13 bytes of a malware sample, we can\nsuccessfully evade Magika in 90% of cases and thereby allow us to send malware\nfiles over Gmail. We then turn our attention to defenses, and develop an\napproach to mitigate the severity of these types of attacks. For our defended\nproduction model, a highly resourced adversary requires 50 bytes to achieve\njust a 20% attack success rate.

Submitted to PNAS", "summary": "The ability to model mechanics of soft materials under flowing conditions is\nkey in designing and engineering processes and materials with targeted\nproperties. This generally requires solution of internal stress tensor, related\nto the deformation tensor through nonlinear and history-dependent constitutive\nmodels. Traditional numerical methods for non-Newtonian fluid dynamics often\nsuffer from prohibitive computational demands and poor scalability to new\nproblem instances. Developments in data-driven methods have mitigated some\nlimitations but still require retraining across varied physical conditions. In\nthis work, we introduce Rheological Operator Transformer (RheOFormer), a\ngenerative operator learning method leveraging self-attention to efficiently\nlearn different spatial interactions and features of complex fluid flows. We\nbenchmark RheOFormer across a range of different viscometric and\nnon-viscometric flows with different types of viscoelastic and\nelastoviscoplastic mechanics in complex domains against ground truth solutions.\nOur results demonstrate that RheOFormer can accurately learn both scalar and\ntensorial nonlinear mechanics of different complex fluids and predict the\nspatio-temporal evolution of their flows, even when trained on limited\ndatasets. Its strong generalization capabilities and computational efficiency\nestablish RheOFormer as a robust neural surrogate for accelerating predictive\ncomplex fluid simulations, advancing data-driven experimentation, and enabling\nreal-time process optimization across a wide range of applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "RheOFormer\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc720\uccb4 \ud750\ub984\uc758

We propose a simple pipeline that\nconverts inference-time retrieval into learned competence through distillation.\nOur approach: (1) extracts compact, reusable hints from agent failures, (2)\nuses these hints to generate improved teacher trajectories via one-shot\nretrieval at episode start, and (3) trains student models on these trajectories\nwith hint strings removed, forcing internalization rather than memorization.\nAcross two interactive benchmarks, ALFWorld (household tasks) and WebShop\n(online shopping), distilled students consistently outperform baseline agents,\nachieving up to 91% success on ALFWorld (vs. 79% for baselines) and improving\nWebShop scores to 72 (vs. 61 for baselines), while using 10-60% fewer tokens\nthan retrieval-augmented teachers depending on the environment. The approach\ngeneralizes across model scales (7B/14B parameters) and agent architectures\n(ReAct/StateAct), demonstrating that retrieval benefits can be effectively\ninternalized through targeted

Current federated learning (FL) frameworks\noffer privacy-preserving model training but lack standardized mechanisms to\norchestrate multi-modal data fusion across distributed and resource-constrained\nenvironments. This study introduces a novel framework that leverages the Model\nContext Protocol (MCP) as an interoperability layer for secure, cross-agent\ncommunication in multi-modal federated healthcare systems. The proposed\narchitecture unifies three pillars: (i) multi-modal feature alignment for\nclinical imaging, electronic medical records, and wearable IoT data; (ii)\nsecure aggregation with differential privacy to protect patient-sensitive\nupdates; and (iii) energy-aware scheduling to mitigate dropouts in mobile\nclients. By employing MCP as a schema-driven interface, the framework enables\nadaptive orchestration of AI agents and toolchains while ensuring compliance\nwith privacy regulations.

There is also heightened interest\nin developing data-driven approaches, particularly neural network models, for\neffective prediction and analysis of scientific datasets. Traditional\ndata-driven methods frequently involve extensive manual intervention, limiting\ntheir ability to scale effectively and generalize to diverse applications. In\nthis study, we propose an innovative pipeline utilizing Large Language Model\n(LLM) agents to automate data-driven modeling and analysis, with a particular\nemphasis on regression tasks. We evaluate two LLM-agent frameworks: a\nmulti-agent system featuring specialized collaborative agents, and a\nsingle-agent system based on the Reasoning and Acting (ReAct) paradigm. Both\nframeworks autonomously handle data preprocessing, neural network development,\ntraining, hyperparameter optimization, and uncertainty quantification (UQ).

One popular approach is prompt guards, lightweight mechanisms\ndesigned to filter malicious queries while being easy to implement and update.\nIn this work, we introduce a new attack that circumvents such prompt guards,\nhighlighting their limitations. Our method consistently jailbreaks production\nmodels while maintaining response quality, even under the highly protected chat\ninterfaces of Google Gemini (2.5 Flash/Pro), DeepSeek Chat (DeepThink), Grok\n(3), and Mistral Le Chat (Magistral).

We introduce OntoLogX, an autonomous Artificial Intelligence\n(AI) agent that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform raw logs\ninto ontology-grounded Knowledge Graphs (KGs). OntoLogX integrates a\nlightweight log ontology with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and\niterative correction steps, ensuring that generated KGs are syntactically and\nsemantically valid. Beyond event-level analysis, the system aggregates KGs into\nsessions and employs a LLM to predict MITRE ATT&CK tactics, linking low-level\nlog evidence to higher-level adversarial objectives. We evaluate OntoLogX on\nboth logs from a public benchmark and a real-world honeypot dataset,\ndemonstrating robust KG generation across multiple KGs backends and accurate\nmapping of adversarial activity to ATT&CK tactics.

Computer-Use Agents Exhibit Blind Goal-Directedness", "comment": null, "summary": "Computer-Use Agents (CUAs) are an increasingly deployed class of agents that\ntake actions on GUIs to accomplish user goals. In this paper, we show that CUAs\nconsistently exhibit Blind Goal-Directedness (BGD): a bias to pursue goals\nregardless of feasibility, safety, reliability, or context. We characterize\nthree prevalent patterns of BGD: (i) lack of contextual reasoning, (ii)\nassumptions and decisions under ambiguity, and (iii) contradictory or\ninfeasible goals. We develop BLIND-ACT, a benchmark of 90 tasks capturing these\nthree patterns. Built on OSWorld, BLIND-ACT provides realistic environments and\nemploys LLM-based judges to evaluate agent behavior, achieving 93.75% agreement\nwith human annotations. We use BLIND-ACT to evaluate nine frontier models,\nincluding Claude Sonnet and Opus 4, Computer-Use-Preview, and GPT-5, observing\nhigh average BGD rates (80.8%) across them. We show that BGD exposes subtle\nrisks that arise even when inputs are not directly harmful. While\nprompting-based interventions lower BGD levels, substantial risk persists,\nhighlighting the need for stronger training- or inference-time interventions.\nQualitative analysis reveals observed failure modes: execution-first bias\n(focusing on how to act over whether to act), thought-action disconnect\n(execution diverging from reasoning), and request-primacy (justifying actions\ndue to user request). Identifying BGD and introducing BLIND-ACT establishes a\nfoundation for future research on studying and mitigating this fundamental risk\nand ensuring safe CUA deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "CUAs\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 GUI\uc5d0\uc11c \ud589\ub3d9\ud558\ub294 \ub300\ud589\uc790\uc774\uba70, \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc774\ub4e4\uc774 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa9\ud45c \uc9c0\ud5a5\uc801 \ub418\uae30\ub9cc \ud558\uace0 \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131, \uc548\uc804\uc131 \ub4f1\uc740 \uace0\ub824\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \uc9c0\ub2cc\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "motivation": "CUAs\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc774 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud568.", "method": "BLIND-ACT \ub77c\ub294 90\uac1c\uc758 \uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 CUAs\uc758 Blind Goal-Directedness (BGD)\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc544\ud649 \uac1c\uc758 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc \ud3c9\uade0 BGD \ube44\uc728\uc774 80.8%\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\uc73c\uba70, \uc778\uac04 \uc8fc\uc11d\uacfc 93.75%\uc758 \uc77c\uce58\ub97c \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "BGD\ub294 CUAs\uc758 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \ubc30\uce58\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \ud574\uacb0\ud574\uc57c \ud560 \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uc704\ud5d8 \uc694\uc18c\ub85c, \uc774\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0 BLIND-ACT\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ud5a5\ud6c4 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \ub9c8\ub828\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucef4\ud4e8\ud130 \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8(CUAs)\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 GUI\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc774 \ubc30\uce58\ub418\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4\ub97c \uc758\ubbf8\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 CUAs\uac00 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa9\ud45c \uc9c0\ud5a5\uc131(BGD)\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131, \uc548\uc804\uc131, \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \ub610\ub294 \ub9e5\ub77d\uacfc \uad00\uacc4\uc5c6\uc774 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ucd94\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 BGD\uc758 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc9d3\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4: (i) \ub9e5\ub77d\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ubd80\uc871, (ii) \ubaa8\ud638\uc131 \uc544\ub798\uc758 \uac00\uc815 \ubc0f \uacb0\uc815, (iii) \ubaa8\uc21c\ub418\uac70\ub098 \uc2e4\ud589 \ubd88\uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubaa9\ud45c. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 90\uac1c\uc758 \uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc9c4 BLIND-ACT\ub77c\ub294 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

In practice, forecasters face\nthousands of short, noisy series that vary in frequency, quality, and horizon,\nwhere the dominant cost lies not in model fitting, but in the labor-intensive\npreprocessing, validation, and ensembling required to obtain reliable\npredictions. Prevailing statistical and deep learning models are tailored to\nspecific datasets or domains and generalize poorly. A general, domain-agnostic\nframework that minimizes human intervention is urgently in demand. In this\npaper, we introduce TimeSeriesScientist (TSci), the first LLM-driven agentic\nframework for general time series forecasting. The framework comprises four\nspecialized agents: Curator performs LLM-guided diagnostics augmented by\nexternal tools that reason over data statistics to choose targeted\npreprocessing; Planner narrows the hypothesis space of model choice by\nleveraging multi-modal diagnostics and self-planning over the input; Forecaster\nperforms model fitting and validation and, based on the results, adaptively\nselects the best model configuration as well as ensemble strategy to make final\npredictions; and Reporter synthesizes the whole process into a comprehensive,\ntransparent report. With transparent natural-language rationales and\ncomprehensive reports, TSci transforms the forecasting workflow into a\nwhite-box system that is both interpretable and extensible across tasks.\nEmpirical results on eight established benchmarks demonstrate that TSci\nconsistently outperforms both statistical and LLM-based baselines, reducing\nforecast error by an average of 10.4% and 38.2%, respectively.

Large language models (LLMs) excel at interpreting such\ninstructions but are prohibitively expensive to deploy at scale, while\ntraditional pipelines of classifiers and extractors remain efficient yet\nbrittle and unable to generalize to new tasks. We introduce Falconer, a\ncollaborative framework that combines the agentic reasoning of LLMs with\nlightweight proxy models for scalable knowledge mining. In Falconer, LLMs act\nas planners, decomposing user instructions into executable pipelines, and as\nannotators, generating supervision to train small proxies. The framework\nunifies classification and extraction into two atomic operations, get label and\nget span, enabling a single instruction-following model to replace multiple\ntask-specific components. To evaluate the consistency between proxy models\nincubated by Falconer and annotations provided by humans and large models, we\nconstruct new benchmarks covering both planning and end-to-end execution.\nExperiments show that Falconer closely matches state-of-the-art LLMs in\ninstruction-following accuracy while reducing inference cost by up to 90% and\naccelerating large-scale knowledge mining by more than 20x, offering an\nefficient and scalable foundation for Deep Research.", "AI": {"tldr": "Falconer\ub294 \uacbd\ub7c9 \ud504\ub85d\uc2dc \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc LLM\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uaddc\ubaa8\uc5d0 \ub9de\ub294 \uc9c0\uc2dd \ub9c8\uc774\ub2dd\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \ud611\uc5c5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM\uc758 \ubc30\ud3ec\uac00 \ube44\uc2f8\uc9c0\uace0 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ubd84\ub958\uae30\uc640 \ucd94\ucd9c\uc790 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc740 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub418\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0 \ud544\uc694\uc131.", "method": "Falconer\ub294 LLM\uc744 \ud50c\ub798\ub108\uc640 \uc8fc\uc11d \ub2ec\uae30 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc9c0\uce68\uc744 \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\uace0 \uc791\uc740 \ud504\ub85d\uc2dc\ub97c \uad50\uc721\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uac10\ub3c5\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "Falconer\ub294 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 LLM\uacfc \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uac00\uc9c0\uba74\uc11c \ucd94\ub860 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \ucd5c\ub300 90% \uc904\uc774\uace0 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc9c0\uc2dd \ub9c8\uc774\ub2dd\uc744 20\ubc30 \uc774\uc0c1 \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Falconer\ub294 Deep Research\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "Deep Research\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec\uc740 \uc9c0\uc2dd \ub9c8\uc774\ub2dd\uc73c\ub85c, \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc758 \uc9c0\uce68\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ubc29\ub300\ud55c \ube44\uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc9c0\uce68\uc744 \ud574\uc11d\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub098\uc9c0\ub9cc \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ubc30\ud3ec\uc5d0\ub294 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \uacfc\uc911\ud558\uba70, \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ubd84\ub958\uae30\uc640 \ucd94\ucd9c\uae30 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc740 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\uace0 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 LLM\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \ucd94\ub860\uacfc \uacbd\ub7c9 \ud504\ub85d\uc2dc \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc9c0\uc2dd \ub9c8\uc774\ub2dd\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud611\uc5c5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Falconer\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Project page:\n  https://metadriverse.github.io/ppl", "summary": "Learning from human involvement aims to incorporate the human subject to\nmonitor and correct agent behavior errors. Although most interactive imitation\nlearning methods focus on correcting the agent's action at the current state,\nthey do not adjust its actions in future states, which may be potentially more\nhazardous. To address this, we introduce Predictive Preference Learning from\nHuman Interventions (PPL), which leverages the implicit preference signals\ncontained in human interventions to inform predictions of future rollouts. The\nkey idea of PPL is to bootstrap each human intervention into L future time\nsteps, called the preference horizon, with the assumption that the agent\nfollows the same action and the human makes the same intervention in the\npreference horizon. By applying preference optimization on these future states,\nexpert corrections are propagated into the safety-critical regions where the\nagent is expected to explore, significantly improving learning efficiency and\nreducing human demonstrations needed. We evaluate our approach with experiments\non both autonomous driving and robotic manipulation benchmarks and demonstrate\nits efficiency and generality. Our theoretical analysis further shows that\nselecting an appropriate preference horizon L balances coverage of risky states\nwith label correctness, thereby bounding the algorithmic optimality gap.

When the true environmental state is not directly observable, humans\nseek information to update their internal dynamics and inform future\ndecision-making. Although existing Large Language Model (LLM) planning agents\nhave addressed observational uncertainty, they often overlook discrepancies\nbetween their internal dynamics and the actual environment. We introduce\nInformation Seeking Decision Planner (InfoSeeker), an LLM decision-making\nframework that integrates task-oriented planning with information seeking to\nalign internal dynamics and make optimal decisions under uncertainty in both\nagent observations and environmental dynamics. InfoSeeker prompts an LLM to\nactively gather information by planning actions to validate its understanding,\ndetect environmental changes, or test hypotheses before generating or revising\ntask-oriented plans. To evaluate InfoSeeker, we introduce a novel benchmark\nsuite featuring partially observable environments with incomplete observations\nand uncertain dynamics. Experiments demonstrate that InfoSeeker achieves a 74%\nabsolute performance gain over prior methods without sacrificing sample\nefficiency. Moreover, InfoSeeker generalizes across LLMs and outperforms\nbaselines on established benchmarks such as robotic manipulation and web\nnavigation.

This paper goes one step ahead with the problem of source-free\ncross-domain continual learning where the use of source-domain samples are\ncompletely prohibited. We propose the idea of rehearsal-free frequency-aware\ndynamic prompt collaborations (REFEREE) to cope with the absence of labeled\nsource-domain samples in realm of cross-domain continual learning. REFEREE is\nbuilt upon a synergy between a source-pre-trained model and a large-scale\nvision-language model, thus overcoming the problem of sub-optimal\ngeneralizations when relying only on a source pre-trained model. The domain\nshift problem between the source domain and the target domain is handled by a\nfrequency-aware prompting technique encouraging low-frequency components while\nsuppressing high-frequency components. This strategy generates frequency-aware\naugmented samples, robust against noisy pseudo labels. The noisy pseudo-label\nproblem is further addressed with the uncertainty-aware weighting strategy\nwhere the mean and covariance matrix are weighted by prediction uncertainties,\nthus mitigating the adverse effects of the noisy pseudo label.

Unlike existing safety alignment methods\nthat optimize directly for safe response, InvThink instructs models to 1)\nenumerate potential harms, 2) analyze their consequences, and 3) generate safe\noutputs that proactively avoid these risks. Our method reveals three key\nfindings: (i) safety improvements show stronger scaling with model size\ncompared to existing safety methods. (ii) InvThink mitigates safety tax; by\ntraining models to systematically consider failure modes, it preserves general\nreasoning capabilities on standard benchmarks. (iii) beyond general safety\ntasks, InvThink excels in high-stakes domains including external-facing\n(medicine, finance, law) and agentic (blackmail, murder) risk scenarios,\nachieving up to 15.7% reduction in harmful responses compared to baseline\nmethods like SafetyPrompt. We further implement InvThink via supervised\nfine-tuning, and reinforcement learning across three LLM families. These\nresults suggest that inverse reasoning provides a scalable and generalizable\npath toward safer, more capable language models.", "AI": {"tldr": "InvThink\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uc5ed \uc0ac\uace0 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubd80\uc5ec\ud558\ub294 \uac04\ub2e8\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc548\uc804 \uc815\ub82c \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc9c1\uc811 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uacfc \ub2ec\ub9ac, InvThink\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \ud574\ub97c \uc5f4\uac70\ud558\uace0, \uadf8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc120\uc81c\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud53c\ud558\ub294 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc9c0\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "InvThink\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud575\uc2ec \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b8\ub2e4: (i) \uc548\uc804 \uac1c\uc120\uc740 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc548\uc804 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud06c\uae30\uc640 \ub354 \uac15\ud55c \ube44\ub840 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b8\ub2e4.

Existing defenses\nfall into two lines: (i) self-verification that asks each agent to pre-filter\nunsafe instructions before execution, and (ii) external guard modules that\npolice behaviors. The former often underperforms because a standalone agent\nlacks sufficient capacity to detect cross-agent unsafe chains and\ndelegation-induced risks; the latter increases system overhead and creates a\nsingle-point-of-failure-once compromised, system-wide safety collapses, and\nadding more guards worsens cost and complexity. To solve these challenges, we\npropose AdvEvo-MARL, a co-evolutionary multi-agent reinforcement learning\nframework that internalizes safety into task agents. Rather than relying on\nexternal guards, AdvEvo-MARL jointly optimizes attackers (which synthesize\nevolving jailbreak prompts) and defenders (task agents trained to both\naccomplish their duties and resist attacks) in adversarial learning\nenvironments. To stabilize learning and foster cooperation, we introduce a\npublic baseline for advantage estimation: agents within the same functional\ngroup share a group-level mean-return baseline, enabling lower-variance updates\nand stronger intra-group coordination. Across representative attack scenarios,\nAdvEvo-MARL consistently keeps attack-success rate (ASR) below 20%, whereas\nbaselines reach up to 38.33%, while preserving-and sometimes improving-task\naccuracy (up to +3.67% on reasoning tasks).

However, in vision tasks, these representations\nare often affected by noisy or irrelevant features, which can degrade the\nmodel's performance and generalization capabilities. This paper presents a\nnovel approach for enhancing latent representations using unsupervised Dynamic\nFeature Selection (DFS). For each instance, the proposed method identifies and\nremoves misleading or redundant information in images, ensuring that only the\nmost relevant features contribute to the latent space. By leveraging an\nunsupervised framework, our approach avoids reliance on labeled data, making it\nbroadly applicable across various domains and datasets. Experiments conducted\non image datasets demonstrate that models equipped with unsupervised DFS\nachieve significant improvements in generalization performance across various\ntasks, including clustering and image generation, while incurring a minimal\nincrease in the computational cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc790\uc728 \ub3d9\uc801 \ud2b9\uc9d5 \uc120\ud0dd(DFS)\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc7a0\uc7ac \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc7a0\uc7ac \ud45c\ud604\uc740 \uba38\uc2e0 \ub7ec\ub2dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ube44\uc804 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc885\uc885 \ub178\uc774\uc988\ub098 \uad00\ub828 \uc5c6\ub294 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc758 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubc1b\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uac01 \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc624\ub3c4\ub418\uac70\ub098 \uc911\ubcf5\ub41c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0 \uc81c\uac70\ud558\uba70, \uac00\uc7a5 \uad00\ub828 \uc788\ub294 \ud2b9\uc9d5\ub9cc\uc774 \uc7a0\uc7ac \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ube44\uc9c0\ub3c4 DFS\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130\ub9c1 \ubc0f \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uc131\ub2a5\uc758 \uc720\uc758\ubbf8\ud55c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ub77c\ubca8\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\ubbc0\ub85c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uacfc \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud558\uac8c \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc7a0\uc7ac \ud45c\ud604\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ud544\uc218 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \uac04\uacb0\ud558\uace0 \uc720\uc775\ud55c \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ud558\ubbc0\ub85c \uba38\uc2e0 \ub7ec\ub2dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ube44\uc804 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud45c\ud604\uc774 \uc885\uc885 \ub178\uc774\uc988 \ub610\ub294 \uad00\ub828 \uc5c6\ub294 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc758 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubc1b\uc544 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \uc800\ud558\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ube44\uc9c0\ub3c4 \ub3d9\uc801 \ud2b9\uc9d5 \uc120\ud0dd(DFS)\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc7a0\uc7ac \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uac01 \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc624\ub3c4\ub418\uac70\ub098 \uc911\ubcf5\ub41c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0 \uc81c\uac70\ud558\uc5ec \uac00\uc7a5 \uad00\ub828 \uc788\ub294 \ud2b9\uc9d5\ub9cc\uc774 \uc7a0\uc7ac \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ube44\uc9c0\ub3c4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ub77c\ubca8\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba70, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uacfc \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud558\uac8c \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uc218\ud589\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \ube44\uc9c0\ub3c4 DFS\ub85c \uc7a5\ucc29\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130\ub9c1 \ubc0f \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uc0dd\uc131 \ub4f1 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc720\uc758\ubbf8\ud558\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba74\uc11c \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc758 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud55c\uc758 \uc99d\uac00\ub97c \uc218\ubc18\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, existing approaches face substantial challenges\nin handling dynamic user preferences, maintaining conversation coherence, and\nbalancing multiple ranking objectives simultaneously. This paper introduces\nAgentRec, a next-generation LLM-powered multi-agent collaborative\nrecommendation framework that addresses these limitations through hierarchical\nagent networks with adaptive intelligence. Our approach employs specialized\nLLM-powered agents for conversation understanding, preference modeling, context\nawareness, and dynamic ranking, coordinated through an adaptive weighting\nmechanism that learns from interaction patterns. We propose a three-tier\nlearning strategy combining rapid response for simple queries, intelligent\nreasoning for complex preferences, and deep collaboration for challenging\nscenarios. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that\nAgentRec achieves consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, with\n2.8\\% enhancement in conversation success rate, 1.9\\% improvement in\nrecommendation accuracy (NDCG@10), and 3.2\\% better conversation efficiency\nwhile maintaining comparable computational costs through intelligent agent\ncoordination.", "AI": {"tldr": "AgentRec\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc120\ud638\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \ucc28\uc138\ub300 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud611\uc5c5 \ucd94\ucc9c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub300\ud654\ud615 \ucd94\ucc9c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc120\ud638\ub3c4 \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub300\uc751\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ub300\ud654\uc758 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uacfc \ub2e4\uc911 \ub7ad\ud0b9 \ubaa9\ud45c \uac04\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "AgentRec\ub294 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uba70, \ub300\ud654 \uc774\ud574, \uc120\ud638 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1, \uc0c1\ud669 \uc778\uc2dd \ubc0f \ub3d9\uc801 \ub7ad\ud0b9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud2b9\ud654\ub41c LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "AgentRec\ub294 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \ub300\ud654 \uc131\uacf5\ub960 2.8%, \ucd94\ucc9c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4(NDCG@10) 1.9%, \ub300\ud654 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 3.2% \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc9c0\ub2a5\ud615 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ube44\uad50 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud654\ud615 \ucd94\ucc9c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc120\ud638\ub97c \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc73c\ub85c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc8fc\ubaa9\uc744 \ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc120\ud638\ub97c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \ub370, \ub300\ud654\uc758 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ub370, \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub7ad\ud0b9 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uade0\ud615 \uc788\uac8c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud070 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc744 \uac16\ucd98 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 AgentRec\ub77c\ub294 \ucc28\uc138\ub300 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud611\uc5c5 \ucd94\ucc9c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ub300\ud654 \uc774\ud574, \uc120\ud638 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1, \uc0c1\ud669 \uc778\uc2dd \ubc0f \ub3d9\uc801 \ub7ad\ud0b9\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ud2b9\ud654\ub41c LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uba70 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ud328\ud134\uc5d0\uc11c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uac00\uc911\uce58 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc870\uc815\ub41c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \ucffc\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ube60\ub978 \uc751\ub2f5, \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc120\ud638\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc9c0\ub2a5\ud615 \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc2ec\uce35 \ud611\uc5c5\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \uc0bc\uc911 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, AgentRec\ub294 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc744 \ucd08\uc6d4\ud55c \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \ub300\ud654 \uc131\uacf5\ub960 2.8\\%, \ucd94\ucc9c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4(NDCG@10) 1.9\\', \ub300\ud654 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 3.2\\% \ud5a5\uc0c1\uacfc \ud568\uaed8 \uc9c0\ub2a5\ud615 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ube44\uad50 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uc600\ub2e4."}}

While modern video games may\noffer rich dynamics, they are computationally expensive and poorly suited for\nlarge-scale experimentation due to their CPU-bound execution. We introduce\nOctax, a high-performance suite of classic arcade game environments implemented\nin JAX, based on CHIP-8 emulation, a predecessor to Atari, which is widely\nadopted as a benchmark in RL research. Octax provides the JAX community with a\nlong-awaited end-to-end GPU alternative to the Atari benchmark, offering\nimage-based environments, spanning puzzle, action, and strategy genres, all\nexecutable at massive scale on modern GPUs. Our JAX-based implementation\nachieves orders-of-magnitude speedups over traditional CPU emulators while\nmaintaining perfect fidelity to the original game mechanics. We demonstrate\nOctax's capabilities by training RL agents across multiple games, showing\nsignificant improvements in training speed and scalability compared to existing\nsolutions.

We\ndevelop five distinct GuruAgents, each designed to emulate an iconic investor,\nby encoding their distinct philosophies into LLM prompts that integrate\nfinancial tools and a deterministic reasoning pipeline. In a backtest on\nNASDAQ-100 constituents from Q4 2023 to Q2 2025, the GuruAgents exhibit unique\nbehaviors driven by their prompted personas.

Nevertheless, these methods often rely on exhaustive\nhyperparameter searches, where methods automatically train and test different\ntypes of models on the target dataset. Contrastingly, pre-hoc prediction\nemerges as a promising alternative, capable of bypassing exhaustive search\nthrough intelligent pre-selection of models. Despite its potential, pre-hoc\nprediction remains under-explored in the literature. This paper explores the\nintersection of AutoML and pre-hoc model selection by leveraging traditional\nmodels and Large Language Model (LLM) agents to reduce the search space of\nAutoML libraries. By relying on dataset descriptions and statistical\ninformation, we reduce the AutoML search space. Our methodology is applied to\nthe AWS AutoGluon portfolio dataset, a state-of-the-art AutoML benchmark\ncontaining 175 tabular classification datasets available on OpenML.

Our research presents a multimodal\nfoundation model that consolidates diverse patient data through an\nattention-based transformer framework. At first, dedicated encoders put each\nmodality into a shared latent space. Then, they combine them using multi-head\nattention and residual normalization. The architecture is made for pretraining\non many tasks, which makes it easy to adapt to new diseases and datasets with\nlittle extra work.

Knowledge graphs address these challenges\nby structuring mass spectrometry data, metabolite information, and their\nrelationships into a connected network (Gaudry et al. 2024). However, effective\nuse of a knowledge graph demands an in-depth understanding of its ontology and\nits query language syntax. To overcome this, we designed MetaboT, an AI system\nutilizing large language models (LLMs) to translate user questions into SPARQL\nsemantic query language for operating on knowledge graphs (Steve Harris 2013).\nWe demonstrate its effectiveness using the Experimental Natural Products\nKnowledge Graph (ENPKG), a large-scale public knowledge graph for plant natural\nproducts (Gaudry et al. 2024).MetaboT employs specialized AI agents for\nhandling user queries and interacting with the knowledge graph by breaking down\ncomplex tasks into discrete components, each managed by a specialised agent\n(Fig. 1a). The multi-agent system is constructed using the LangChain and\nLangGraph libraries, which facilitate the integration of LLMs with external\ntools and information sources (LangChain, n.d.). The query generation process\nfollows a structured workflow. First, the Entry Agent determines if the\nquestion is new or a follow-up to previous interactions. New questions are\nforwarded to the Validator Agent, which verifies if the question is related to\nthe knowledge graph. Then, the valid question is sent to the Supervisor Agent,\nwhich identifies if the question requires chemical conversions or standardized\nidentifiers. In this case it delegates the question to the Knowledge Graph\nAgent, which can use tools to extract necessary details, such as URIs or\ntaxonomies of chemical names, from the user query. Finally, an agent\nresponsible for crafting the SPARQL queries equipped with the ontology of the\nknowledge graph uses the provided identifiers to generate the query. Then, the\nsystem executes the generated query against the metabolomics knowledge graph\nand returns structured results to the user (Fig. 1b). To assess the performance\nof MetaboT we have curated 50 metabolomics-related questions and their expected\nanswers. In addition to submitting these questions to MetaboT, we evaluated a\nbaseline by submitting them to a standard LLM (GPT-4o) with a prompt that\nincorporated the knowledge graph ontology but did not provide specific entity\nIDs. This baseline achieved only 8.16% accuracy, compared to MetaboT's 83.67%,\nunderscoring the necessity of our multi-agent system for accurately retrieving\nentities and generating correct SPARQL queries. MetaboT demonstrates promising\nperformance as a conversational question-answering assistant, enabling\nresearchers to retrieve structured metabolomics data through natural language\nqueries. By automating the generation and execution of SPARQL queries, it\nremoves technical barriers that have traditionally hindered access to knowledge\ngraphs. Importantly, MetaboT leverages the capabilities of LLMs while\nmaintaining experimentally grounded query generation, ensuring that outputs\nremain aligned with domain-specific standards and data structures.

This framework is formulated as Action-Triggered Sporadically\nTraceable Markov Decision Processes (ATST-MDPs), where each action has a\nspecified probability of triggering a state observation. We derive tailored\nBellman optimality equations for this framework and introduce the\naction-sequence learning paradigm in which agents commit to executing a\nsequence of actions until the next observation arrives. Under the linear MDP\nassumption, value-functions are shown to admit linear representations in an\ninduced action-sequence feature map.

This work introduces Flatness-Aware Stochastic Gradient Langevin\nDynamics (fSGLD), designed to efficiently and provably seek flat minima in\nhigh-dimensional nonconvex optimization problems. At each iteration, fSGLD uses\nthe stochastic gradient evaluated at parameters perturbed by isotropic Gaussian\nnoise, commonly referred to as Random Weight Perturbation (RWP), thereby\noptimizing a randomized-smoothing objective that implicitly captures curvature\ninformation. Leveraging these properties, we prove that the invariant measure\nof fSGLD stays close to a stationary measure concentrated on the global\nminimizers of a loss function regularized by the Hessian trace whenever the\ninverse temperature and the scale of random weight perturbation are properly\ncoupled. This result provides a rigorous theoretical explanation for the\nbenefits of random weight perturbation. In particular, we establish\nnon-asymptotic convergence guarantees in Wasserstein distance with the best\nknown rate and derive an excess-risk bound for the Hessian-trace regularized\nobjective. Extensive experiments on noisy-label and large-scale vision tasks,\nin both training-from-scratch and fine-tuning settings, demonstrate that fSGLD\nachieves superior or comparable generalization and robustness to baseline\nalgorithms while maintaining the computational cost of SGD, about half that of\nSAM.

At the same time, this implies various challenges and\nrisks regarding building and deploying human-AI teaming systems in an effective\nand ethical manner. Currently, understanding and coping with them are often\ntackled from an external perspective considering the human-AI teaming system as\na collective agent. Nevertheless, zooming into the dynamics involved inside the\nsystem assures dealing with a broader palette of relevant multidimensional\nresponsibility, safety, and robustness aspects. To this end, this research\nproposes the design of a trustworthy co-learning model for human-AI teaming in\nmilitary operations that encompasses a continuous and bidirectional exchange of\ninsights between the human and AI agents as they jointly adapt to evolving\nbattlefield conditions. It does that by integrating four dimensions. First,\nadjustable autonomy for dynamically calibrating the autonomy levels of agents\ndepending on aspects like mission state, system confidence, and environmental\nuncertainty. Second, multi-layered control which accounts continuous oversight,\nmonitoring of activities, and accountability. Third, bidirectional feedback\nwith explicit and implicit feedback loops between the agents to assure a proper\ncommunication of reasoning, uncertainties, and learned adaptations that each of\nthe agents has. And fourth, collaborative decision-making which implies the\ngeneration, evaluation, and proposal of decisions associated with confidence\nlevels and rationale behind them. The model proposed is accompanied by concrete\nexemplifications and recommendations that contribute to further developing\nresponsible and trustworthy human-AI teaming systems in military operations.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI\ub97c \uad70\uc0ac \uc791\uc804\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc774\uc810\uacfc \ud568\uaed8, \uc778\uac04-AI \ud300

While prior benchmarks have evaluated LLM agents in domains\nsuch as software engineering and scientific discovery, the finance domain\nremains underexplored, despite its direct relevance to economic value and\nhigh-stakes decision-making. Existing financial benchmarks primarily test\nstatic knowledge through question answering, but they fall short of capturing\nthe dynamic and iterative nature of trading. To address this gap, we introduce\nStockBench, a contamination-free benchmark designed to evaluate LLM agents in\nrealistic, multi-month stock trading environments. Agents receive daily market\nsignals -- including prices, fundamentals, and news -- and must make sequential\nbuy, sell, or hold decisions. Performance is assessed using financial metrics\nsuch as cumulative return, maximum drawdown, and the Sortino ratio. Our\nevaluation of state-of-the-art proprietary (e.g., GPT-5, Claude-4) and\nopen-weight (e.g., Qwen3, Kimi-K2, GLM-4.5) models shows that while most LLM\nagents struggle to outperform the simple buy-and-hold baseline, several models\ndemonstrate the potential to deliver higher returns and manage risk more\neffectively. These findings highlight both the challenges and opportunities in\ndeveloping LLM-powered financial agents, showing that excelling at static\nfinancial knowledge tasks does not necessarily translate into successful\ntrading strategies. We release StockBench as an open-source resource to support\nreproducibility and advance future research in this domain.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc740

The traditional human-only\npeer review regime lacks a scalable, objective benchmark, making editorial\nprocesses opaque and difficult to audit. Here we investigate a deterministic\nsimulation framework that provides the first stable, evidence-based standard\nfor evaluating AI-generated peer review reports. Analyzing 352 peer-review\nsimulation reports, we identify consistent system state indicators that\ndemonstrate its reliability. First, the system is able to simulate calibrated\neditorial judgment, with 'Revise' decisions consistently forming the majority\noutcome (>50%) across all disciplines, while 'Reject' rates dynamically adapt\nto field-specific norms, rising to 45% in Health Sciences. Second, it maintains\nunwavering procedural integrity, enforcing a stable 29% evidence-anchoring\ncompliance rate that remains invariant across diverse review tasks and\nscientific domains. These findings demonstrate a system that is predictably\nrule-bound, mitigating the stochasticity of generative AI. For the scientific\ncommunity, this provides a transparent tool to ensure fairness; for publishing\nstrategists, it offers a scalable instrument for auditing workflows, managing\nintegrity risks, and implementing evidence-based governance.

In this paper, we introduce\nInteractive Training, an open-source framework that enables real-time,\nfeedback-driven intervention during neural network training by human experts or\nautomated AI agents. At its core, Interactive Training uses a control server to\nmediate communication between users or agents and the ongoing training process,\nallowing users to dynamically adjust optimizer hyperparameters, training data,\nand model checkpoints. Through three case studies, we demonstrate that\nInteractive Training achieves superior training stability, reduced sensitivity\nto initial hyperparameters, and improved adaptability to evolving user needs,\npaving the way toward a future training paradigm where AI agents autonomously\nmonitor training logs, proactively resolve instabilities, and optimize training\ndynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "Interactive Training\uc740 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \ud6c8\ub828 \uc911 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \uae30\ubc18 \uac1c\uc785\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uc624\ud508\uc18c\uc2a4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \ud6c8\ub828\uc740 \uace0\uc815\ub41c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ub808\uc2dc\ud53c\ub97c \ub530\ub974\uba70, \ubd88\uc548\uc815\uc131\uc774\ub098 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub300\uc751\ud558\ub294 \uc720\uc5f0\uc131\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "Interactive Training\uc740 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc11c\ubc84\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\ub098 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \uc9c4\ud589 \uc911\uc778 \ud6c8\ub828 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \uac04\uc758 \uc18c\ud1b5\uc744 \uc911\uc7ac\ud558\uace0, \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uac00 \ucd5c\uc801\uae30 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130, \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130, \ubaa8\ub378 \uccb4\ud06c\ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8\ub97c \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc815\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc0ac\ub840 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 Interactive Training\uc774 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \uc0c1\uc2b9\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0, \ucd08\uae30 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubbfc\uac10\ub3c4\ub97c \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba70, \uc9c4\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc694\uad6c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc801\uc751\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub85c\uadf8\ub97c \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\ud558\uace0, \ubd88\uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \uc120\uc81c\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uba70, \ud6c8\ub828 \uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ubbf8\ub798 \ud6c8\ub828 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\uc544\uac08 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uae38\uc744 \uc5f4\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \ud6c8\ub828\uc740 \uace0\uc815\ub41c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ub808\uc2dc\ud53c\ub97c \ub530\ub974\uba70, \ubd88\uc548\uc815\uc131\uc774\ub098 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub300\uc751\ud558\ub294 \uc720\uc5f0\uc131\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \ud6c8\ub828 \uc911 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \uae30\ubc18 \uac1c\uc785\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uc624\ud508\uc18c\uc2a4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Interactive Training\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.

However, existing benchmarks provide only raw data points without\nsemantic context, overlooking rich textual metadata such as feature\ndescriptions and domain knowledge that experts rely on in practice. This\nlimitation restricts research flexibility and prevents models from fully\nleveraging domain knowledge for detection. ReTabAD addresses this gap by\nrestoring textual semantics to enable context-aware tabular AD research. We\nprovide (1) 20 carefully curated tabular datasets enriched with structured\ntextual metadata, together with implementations of state-of-the-art AD\nalgorithms including classical, deep learning, and LLM-based approaches, and\n(2) a zero-shot LLM framework that leverages semantic context without\ntask-specific training, establishing a strong baseline for future research.\nFurthermore, this work provides insights into the role and utility of textual\nmetadata in AD through experiments and analysis.

Under Review", "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at multi-step reasoning problems with\nexplicit chain-of-thought (CoT), but verbose traces incur significant\ncomputational costs and memory overhead, and often carry redundant, stylistic\nartifacts. Latent reasoning has emerged as an efficient alternative that\ninternalizes the thought process, but it suffers from a critical lack of\nsupervision, limiting its effectiveness on complex, natural-language reasoning\ntraces. In this work, we propose KaVa, the first framework that bridges this\ngap by distilling knowledge directly from a compressed KV-cache of the teacher\ninto a latent-reasoning student via self-distillation, leveraging the\nrepresentational flexibility of continuous latent tokens to align stepwise KV\ntrajectories. We show that the abstract, unstructured knowledge within\ncompressed KV-cache, which lacks direct token correspondence, can serve as a\nrich supervisory signal for a latent reasoning student. Empirically, the\napproach consistently outperforms strong latent baselines, exhibits markedly\nsmaller degradation from equation-only to natural-language traces, and scales\nto larger backbones while preserving efficiency. These results establish\ncompressed KV-cache distillation as a scalable supervision signal for latent\nreasoning, combining the accuracy of CoT-trained teachers with the efficiency\nand deployability

We investigate models'\nabstraction abilities on ConceptARC. We evaluate models under settings that\nvary the input modality (textual vs. visual), whether the model is permitted to\nuse external Python tools, and, for reasoning models, the amount of reasoning\neffort. In addition to measuring output accuracy, we perform fine-grained\nevaluation of the natural-language rules that models generate to explain their\nsolutions. This dual evaluation lets us assess whether models solve tasks using\nthe abstractions ConceptARC was designed to elicit, rather than relying on\nsurface-level patterns. Our results show that, while some models using\ntext-based representations match human output accuracy, the best models' rules\nare often based on surface-level ``shortcuts'' and capture intended\nabstractions far less often than humans. Thus their capabilities for general\nabstract reasoning may be overestimated by evaluations based on accuracy alone.\nIn the visual modality, AI models' output accuracy drops sharply, yet our\nrule-level analysis reveals that models might be underestimated, as they still\nexhibit a substantial share of rules that capture intended abstractions, but\nare often unable to correctly apply these rules. In short, our results show\nthat models still lag humans in abstract reasoning, and that using accuracy\nalone to evaluate abstract reasoning on ARC-like tasks may overestimate\nabstract-reasoning capabilities in textual modalities and underestimate it in\nvisual modalities. We believe that our evaluation framework offers a more\nfaithful picture of multimodal models' abstract reasoning abilities and a more\nprincipled way to track progress toward human-like,

As a representative embodiment, Deep Research Agents\n(DRAs) systematically exhibit the capabilities for task decomposition,\ncross-source retrieval, multi-stage reasoning, and structured output, which\nmarkedly enhance performance on complex and open-ended tasks. However, existing\nbenchmarks remain deficient in evaluation dimensions, response formatting, and\nscoring mechanisms, limiting their capacity to assess such systems effectively.\nThis paper introduces a rigorous benchmark and a multidimensional evaluation\nframework tailored to DRAs and report-style responses. The benchmark comprises\n214 expert-curated challenging queries distributed across 10 broad thematic\ndomains, each accompanied by manually constructed reference bundles to support\ncomposite evaluation.

Although biosignal modalities differ in functionality, signal fidelity,\nsensor comfort, and cost, they are often intercorrelated, reflecting the\nholistic and interconnected nature of human physiology. This opens up the\npossibility of performing the same tasks using alternative biosignal\nmodalities, thereby improving the accessibility, usability, and adaptability of\nhealth monitoring systems. However, the limited availability of large labeled\ndatasets presents challenges for training models tailored to specific tasks and\nmodalities of interest. Unsupervised cross-modal knowledge transfer offers a\npromising solution by leveraging knowledge from an existing modality to support\nmodel training for a new modality. Existing methods are typically based on\nknowledge distillation, which requires running a teacher model alongside\nstudent model training, resulting in high computational and memory overhead.\nThis challenge is further exacerbated by the recent development of foundation\nmodels that demonstrate superior performance and generalization across tasks at\nthe cost of large model sizes. To this end, we explore a new framework for\nunsupervised cross-modal knowledge transfer of biosignals by training a\nlightweight bridge network to align the intermediate representations and enable\ninformation flow between foundation models and across modalities. Specifically,\nwe introduce an efficient strategy for selecting alignment positions where the\nbridge should be constructed, along with a flexible prototype network as the\nbridge architecture. Extensive experiments across multiple biosignal\nmodalities, tasks, and datasets show that BioX-Bridge reduces the number of\ntrainable parameters by 88--99\\% while maintaining or even improving transfer\nperformance compared to state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Biosignal modalitiy\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc5f0\uad00\uc131\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4
