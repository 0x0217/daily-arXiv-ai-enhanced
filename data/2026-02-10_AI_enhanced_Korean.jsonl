Focusing on models that range from 7 to 9 billion parameters in size engaged in a ten-round repeated Prisoner's Dilemma, we evaluate whether short, costless pre-play messages emulating the cheap-talk paradigm affect strategic stability. Our analysis uses simulation-level bootstrap resampling and nonparametric inference to compare cooperation trajectories fitted with LOWESS regression across both the messaging and the no-messaging condition. We demonstrate consistent reductions in trajectory noise across a majority of the model-context pairings being studied. The stabilizing effect persists across multiple prompt variants and decoding regimes, though its magnitude depends on model choice and contextual framing, with models displaying higher baseline volatility gaining the most. While communication rarely produces harmful instability, we document a few context-specific exceptions and identify the limited domains in which communication harms stability. These findings position cheap-talk style communication as a low-cost, practical tool for improving the predictability and reliability of strategic behavior in multi-agent LLM systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9\uc758 \uc608\uce21 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc758 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \uc0ac\uace0\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud589\ub3d9\uc758 \uc608\uce21 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc800\ud574\ud558\ub294 \ub9e5\ub77d \uc758\uc874\uc801 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc744 \ud574\uc18c\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "7\uc5b5\uc5d0\uc11c 9\uc5b5 \uac1c \ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uc744 \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uc5f4 \ubc88 \ubc18\ubcf5\ub41c \uc8c4\uc218\uc758 \ub51c\ub808\ub9c8 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c, \uc800\ube44\uc6a9\uc758 \uc0ac\uc804 \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0\uac00 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ubd80\ud2b8\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub7a9 \uc7ac\ud45c\uc9d1 \ubc0f \ube44\ubaa8\uc218 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378-\ub9e5\ub77d \uc870\ud569\uc5d0\uc11c \uacbd\ub85c\uc758 \uc7a1\uc74c\uc774 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uac10\uc18c\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc800\ube44\uc6a9\uc758 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 LLM \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9\uc758 \uc608\uce21 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uacfc \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc720\ud6a8\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c\ub85c \uc790\ub9ac\uc7a1\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \uc0ac\uace0\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc608\uce21 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc800\ud574\ud558\ub294 \ub69c\ub837\ud55c \ub9e5\ub77d \uc758\uc874\uc801 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4. 70\uc5b5\uc5d0\uc11c 90\uc5b5 \uac1c\uc758 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uc774 \ucc38\uc5ec\ud55c \uc5f4 \ubc88 \ubc18\ubcf5\ub41c \uc8c4\uc218\uc758 \ub51c\ub808\ub9c8\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uc5b4, \uc800\ube44\uc6a9\uc758 \uc0ac\uc804 \ub300\ud654 \ubaa8\ubc29\uc774 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubd84\uc11d\uc740 \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0 \uc804\uc1a1 \ubc0f \ube44\uc804\uc1a1 \uc870\uac74\uc758 \ud611\ub825 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c LOWESS \ud68c\uadc0\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ube44\uad50\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uc218\uc900 \ubd80\ud2b8\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub7a9 \uc7ac\ud45c\uc9d1 \ubc0f \ube44\ubaa8\uc218 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub41c \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378-\ub9e5\ub77d \uc870\ud569\uc5d0\uc11c \uacbd\ub85c \uc7a1\uc74c\uc774 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uac10\uc18c\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc548\uc815\ud654 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ubcc0\ud615 \ubc0f \ub514\ucf54\ub529 \uccb4\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c0\uc18d\ub418\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uadf8 \ud06c\uae30\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc120\ud0dd \ubc0f \ub9e5\ub77d\uc801 \ud504\ub808\uc774\ubc0d\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ub2ec\ub77c\uc9c0\uba70, \uae30\ubcf8 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc774 \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uac00\uc7a5 \ud070 \uc774\uc775\uc744 \uc5bb\ub294\ub2e4. \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc774 \ud574\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubd88\uc548\uc815\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\ub294 \ub4dc\ubb3c\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uba87 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub9e5\ub77d\ubcc4 \uc608\uc678\ub97c \ubb38\uc11c\ud654\ud558\uace0 \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc774 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc5d0 \ud574\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc601\uc5ed\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc1c\uacac\uc740 \uc800\ube44\uc6a9 \ub300\ud654 \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c\uc758 \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc774 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 LLM \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9\uc758 \uc608\uce21 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uacfc \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub85c \uc790\ub9ac\ub9e4\uae40\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

Oliehoek"], "title": "Sample-Efficient Policy Space Response Oracles with Joint Experience Best Response", "comment": "Accepted at the 25th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS 2026)", "summary": "Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) offers a scalable alternative to exact game-theoretic analysis but suffers from non-stationarity and the need to maintain diverse populations of strategies that capture non-transitive interactions. Policy Space Response Oracles (PSRO) address these issues by iteratively expanding a restricted game with approximate best responses (BRs), yet per-agent BR training makes it prohibitively expensive in many-agent or simulator-expensive settings. We introduce Joint Experience Best Response (JBR), a drop-in modification to PSRO that collects trajectories once under the current meta-strategy profile and reuses this joint dataset to compute BRs for all agents simultaneously. This amortizes environment interaction and improves the sample efficiency of best-response computation. Because JBR converts BR computation into an offline RL problem, we propose three remedies for distribution-shift bias: (i) Conservative JBR with safe policy improvement, (ii) Exploration-Augmented JBR that perturbs data collection and admits theoretical guarantees, and (iii) Hybrid BR that interleaves JBR with periodic independent BR updates. Across benchmark multi-agent environments, Exploration-Augmented JBR achieves the best accuracy-efficiency trade-off, while Hybrid BR attains near-PSRO performance at a fraction of the sample cost. Overall, JBR makes PSRO substantially more practical for large-scale strategic learning while preserving equilibrium robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "Joint Experience Best Response (JBR)\ub294 \uba40\ud2f0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ucc45 \uacf5\uac04 \uc751\ub2f5 \uc624\ub77c\ud074(PSRO)\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c, \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801 \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uacc4\uc0b0\ud558\uc5ec \ud658\uacbd \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uc808\uc57d\ud558\uace0 \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc778\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uba40\ud2f0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(MARL)\uc740 \uac8c\uc784 \uc774\ub860 \ubd84\uc11d\uc758 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub300\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc131\uacfc \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "Joint Experience Best Response (JBR)\ub294 \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uba54\ud0c0 \uc804\ub7b5 \ud504\ub85c\ud30c\uc77c\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uada4\uc801\uc744 \uc218\uc9d1\ud558\uace0 \uc774 \uacf5\ub3d9 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801 \uc751\ub2f5(BR)\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uacc4\uc0b0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "Exploration-Augmented JBR\ub294 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \uba40\ud2f0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uace0\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uacfc \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uc774\ub8e8\uba70, Hybrid BR\ub294 \uc0d8\ud50c \ube44\uc6a9\uc758 \uc77c\ubd80\ub85c PSRO\uc5d0 \uac00\uae4c\uc6b4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc804\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c JBR\uc740 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc804\ub7b5 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4 PSRO\ub97c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub9cc\ub4e4\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uade0\ud615\uc758 \uacac\uace0\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uba40\ud2f0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(MARL)\uc740 \uac8c\uc784 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ubd84\uc11d\uc758 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub300\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc131\uacfc \ube44\uc804\uc774\ub3d9 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc804\ub7b5 \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc815\ucc45 \uacf5\uac04 \uc751\ub2f5 \uc624\ub77c\ud074(PSRO)\uc740 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \uadfc\uc0ac \ucd5c\uc801 \uc751\ub2f5(BR)\uc73c\ub85c \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ubcc4 BR \ud6c8\ub828\uc740 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub098 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\ud130 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub192\uc740 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uacfc\ub3c4\ud558\uac8c \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub4e0\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uba54\ud0c0 \uc804\ub7b5 \ud504\ub85c\ud30c\uc77c\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uada4\uc801\uc744 \ud55c \ubc88 \uc218\uc9d1\ud558\uace0 \uc774 \uacf5\ub3d9 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 BR\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uacc4\uc0b0\ud558\ub294 PSRO\uc758 \uc218\uc815\uc548\uc778 \uacf5\ub3d9 \uacbd\ud5d8 \ucd5c\uc801 \uc751\ub2f5(JBR)\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ud658\uacbd \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uc808\uc57d\ud558\uace0 \ucd5c\uc801 \uc751\ub2f5 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc758 \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.

We introduce RuleSmith, the first framework that achieves automated game balancing by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of multi-agent LLMs. It couples a game engine, multi-agent LLMs self-play, and Bayesian optimization operating over a multi-dimensional rule space. As a proof of concept, we instantiate RuleSmith on CivMini, a simplified civilization-style game containing heterogeneous factions, economy systems, production rules, and combat mechanics, all governed by tunable parameters. LLM agents interpret textual rulebooks and game states to generate actions, to conduct fast evaluation of balance metrics such as win-rate disparities. To search the parameter landscape efficiently, we integrate Bayesian optimization with acquisition-based adaptive sampling and discrete projection: promising candidates receive more evaluation games for accurate assessment, while exploratory candidates receive fewer games for efficient exploration. Experiments show that RuleSmith converges to highly balanced configurations and provides interpretable rule adjustments that can be directly applied to downstream game systems. Our results illustrate that LLM simulation can serve as a powerful surrogate for automating design and balancing in complex multi-agent environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "RuleSmith\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 LLM\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac8c\uc784 \ubc38\ub7f0\uc2f1\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uac8c\uc784 \ubc38\ub7f0\uc2f1\uc740 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8, \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc9c1\uad00 \ubc0f \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc218\ub3d9 \uc870\uc815\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc624\ub79c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "RuleSmith\ub294 \uac8c\uc784 \uc5d4\uc9c4, \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 LLM \uc790\uac00 \ud50c\ub808\uc774 \ubc0f \ub2e4\ucc28\uc6d0 \uaddc\uce59 \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \uc6b4\uc601\ud558\ub294 \ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, RuleSmith\ub294 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uade0\ud615 \uc7a1\ud78c \uad6c\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ub834\ud558\uba70, \ud558\ub958 \uac8c\uc784 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uc811 \uc801\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uaddc\uce59 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "LLM \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc124\uacc4 \ubc0f \ubc38\ub7f0\uc2f1\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ub300\ub9ac\uc790\ub85c \uae30\ub2a5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac8c\uc784 \ubc38\ub7f0\uc2f1\uc740 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8, \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc758 \uc9c1\uad00, \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc218\ub3d9 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \uc624\ub79c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 LLM\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uac8c\uc784 \ubc38\ub7f0\uc2f1\uc744 \uc2e4\ud604\ud558\ub294 \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 RuleSmith\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uac8c\uc784 \uc5d4\uc9c4, \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 LLM \uc790\uac00 \ud50c\ub808\uc774 \ubc0f \ub2e4\ucc28\uc6d0 \uaddc\uce59 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b4\uc601\ub418\ub294 \ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac1c\ub150 \uc99d\uba85\uc744 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc138\ub825, \uacbd\uc81c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c, \uc0dd\uc0b0 \uaddc\uce59 \ubc0f \uc870\uc815 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub85c \uad00\ub9ac\ub418\ub294 \uc804\ud22c \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uac04\uc18c\ud654\ub41c \ubb38\uba85 \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c \uac8c\uc784\uc778 CivMini\uc5d0\uc11c RuleSmith\ub97c \uad6c\ud604\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

This paper proposes an event-first, frequency-aware forecasting paradigm that directly predicts ramp events and reconstructs the power trajectory thereafter, rather than inferring events from dense forecasts. The framework is built on an enhanced Ramping Behaviour Analysis (RBA$_\u03b8$) method's event representation and progressively integrates statistical, machine-learning, and deep-learning models. Traditional forecasting models with post-hoc event extraction provides a strong interpretable baseline but exhibits limited generalisation across sites. Direct event prediction using Random Forests improves robustness over survival-based formulations, motivating fully event-aware modelling. To capture the multi-scale nature of wind ramps, we introduce an event-first deep architecture that integrates wavelet-based frequency decomposition, temporal excitation features, and adaptive feature selection. The resulting sequence models enable stable long-horizon event prediction, physically consistent trajectory reconstruction, and zero-shot transfer to previously unseen wind farms. Empirical analysis shows that ramp magnitude and duration are governed by distinct mid-frequency bands, allowing accurate signal reconstruction from sparse event forecasts.

However, potential malicious eavesdroppers pose a serious threat to the private information via STNs due to their non-cooperative behavior and ability to launch intelligent attacks. To address this challenge, we propose a cognitive secure communication framework driven by multiple agents that coordinates spectrum scheduling and protection through real-time sensing, thereby disrupting the judgment of eavesdroppers while preserving reliable data transmission. On this basis, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the secrecy probability of legitimate users, subject to a reliable transmission probability threshold. To tackle this problem, we propose a two-layer coordinated defense system. First, we develop a foundation layer based on multi-agent coordination schedule to determine the satellite operation matrix and the frequency slot occupation matrices, aiming to mitigate spectrum congestion and enhance transmission reliability. Then, we exploit generative adversarial networks to produce adversarial matrices, and employ learning-aided power control to set real and adversarial signal powers for protection layer, which actively degrades the inference capability of eavesdroppers. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms benchmark methods in terms of enhancing security performance and reducing power overhead for STNs in the cognitive secure communication scenario.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc704\uc131-\uc9c0\uc0c1 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c(STNs)\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc5d0\uac8c \uc6d0\ud65c\ud55c \ubb34\uc120

Decoupling rollout generation from policy optimization (e.g., leveraging a more efficient model to rollout) could enable substantial efficiency gains, yet doing so introduces a severe distribution mismatch that destabilizes learning. We propose Jackpot, a framework that leverages Optimal Budget Rejection Sampling (OBRS) to directly reduce the discrepancy between the rollout model and the evolving policy. Jackpot integrates a principled OBRS procedure, a unified training objective that jointly updates the policy and rollout models, and an efficient system implementation enabled by top-$k$ probability estimation and batch-level bias correction. Our theoretical analysis shows that OBRS consistently moves the rollout distribution closer to the target distribution under a controllable acceptance budget. Empirically, \\sys substantially improves training stability compared to importance-sampling baselines, achieving performance comparable to on-policy RL when training Qwen3-8B-Base for up to 300 update steps of batchsize 64.

Solving MAPF optimally is known to be NP-hard, leading to the adoption of learning-based approaches to alleviate the online computational burden. Prevailing approaches, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), are typically constrained to pairwise message passing between agents. However, this limitation leads to suboptimal behaviours and critical issues, such as attention dilution, particularly in dense environments where group (i.e. beyond just two agents) coordination is most critical. Despite the importance of such higher-order interactions, existing approaches have not been able to fully explore them. To address this representational bottleneck, we introduce HMAGAT (Hypergraph Multi-Agent Attention Network), a novel architecture that leverages attentional mechanisms over directed hypergraphs to explicitly capture group dynamics. Empirically, HMAGAT establishes a new state-of-the-art among learning-based MAPF solvers: e.g., despite having just 1M parameters and being trained on 100$\\times$ less data, it outperforms the current SoTA 85M parameter model. Through detailed analysis of HMAGAT's attention values, we demonstrate how hypergraph representations mitigate the attention dilution inherent in GNNs and capture complex interactions where pairwise methods fail.

Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles", "summary": "Climate hazards increasingly disrupt urban transportation and emergency-response operations by damaging housing stock, degrading infrastructure, and reducing network accessibility. This paper presents Skjold-DiT, a diffusion-transformer framework that integrates heterogeneous spatio-temporal urban data to forecast building-level climate-risk indicators while explicitly incorporating transportation-network structure and accessibility signals relevant to intelligent vehicles (e.g., emergency reachability and evacuation-route constraints). Concretely, Skjold-DiT enables hazard-conditioned routing constraints by producing calibrated, uncertainty-aware accessibility layers (reachability, travel-time inflation, and route redundancy) that can be consumed by intelligent-vehicle routing and emergency dispatch systems. Skjold-DiT combines: (1) Fjell-Prompt, a prompt-based conditioning interface designed to support cross-city transfer; (2) Norrland-Fusion, a cross-modal attention mechanism unifying hazard maps/imagery, building attributes, demographics, and transportation infrastructure into a shared latent representation; and (3) Valkyrie-Forecast, a counterfactual simulator for generating probabilistic risk trajectories under intervention prompts.

Real-world malware binaries are typically stripped of symbols, contain large numbers of functions, and distribute malicious behavior across multiple code regions, making TTP attribution difficult. Recent large language models (LLMs) offer strong code understanding capabilities, but applying them directly to this task faces challenges in identifying analysis entry points, reasoning under partial observability, and misalignment with TTP-specific decision logic. We present TTPDetect, the first LLM agent for recognizing TTPs in stripped malware binaries. TTPDetect combines dense retrieval with LLM-based neural retrieval to narrow the space of analysis entry points. TTPDetect further employs a function-level analyzing agent consisting of a Context Explorer that performs on-demand, incremental context retrieval and a TTP-Specific Reasoning Guideline that achieves inference-time alignment. We build a new dataset that labels decompiled functions with TTPs across diverse malware families and platforms. TTPDetect achieves 93.25% precision and 93.81% recall on function-level TTP recognition, outperforming baselines by 10.38% and 18.78%, respectively. When evaluated on real world malware samples, TTPDetect recognizes TTPs with a precision of 87.37%. For malware with expert-written reports, TTPDetect recovers 85.7% of the documented TTPs and further discovers, on average, 10.5 previously unreported TTPs per malware.", "AI": {"tldr": "TTPDetect\ub294 \uc545\uc131 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc774\uc9c4 \ud30c\uc77c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc804\uc220, \uae30\ubc95 \ubc0f \uc808\ucc28(TTP)\ub97c \uc778\uc2dd\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c, \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc545\uc131 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc774\uc9c4 \ud30c\uc77c\uc758 TTP\ub97c \uc774\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ubcf4\uc548 \ubd84\uc11d\uacfc \uc704\ud611 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc218\uc9d1\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\ub098, \uc2e4\uc81c\ub85c\ub294 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc774 \uc874\uc7ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "TTPDetect\ub294 \ubc00\uc9d1 \uac80\uc0c9\uacfc LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc2e0\uacbd \uac80\uc0c9\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ubd84\uc11d \uc9c4\uc785\uc810\uc758 \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \uc881\ud788\uace0, \uae30\ub2a5 \ub808\ubca8 \ubd84\uc11d \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 TTP-\ud2b9\ud654 \ucd94\ub860 \uc9c0\uce68\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "TTPDetect\ub294 \uae30\ub2a5 \uc218\uc900 TTP \uc778\uc2dd\uc5d0\uc11c 93.25%\uc758 \uc815\ubc00\ub3c4\uc640 93.81%\uc758 \uc7ac\ud604\uc728\uc744 \uae30\ub85d\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc2e4\uc81c \uc545\uc131 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 87.37%\uc758 \uc815\ubc00\ub3c4\ub85c TTP\ub97c \uc778\uc2dd\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "TTPDetect\ub294 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc791\uc131 \ubcf4\uace0\uc11c\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \uc545\uc131 \ucf54\ub4dc\uc758 TTP\ub97c 85.7% \ud68c\ubcf5\ud558\uace0, \ud3c9\uade0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac01 \uc545\uc131 \ucf54\ub4dc\ub2f9 10.5\uac1c\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 TTP\ub97c \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc545\uc131 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc774\uc9c4 \ud30c\uc77c\uc5d0\uc11c TTP(\uc804\uc220, \uae30\ubc95 \ubc0f \uc808\ucc28)\ub97c \uc774\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ubcf4\uc548 \ubd84\uc11d \ubc0f \uc704\ud611 \uc815\ubcf4\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc2e4\uc81c\ub85c\ub294 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\ub2e4. \ud604\uc2e4 \uc138\uacc4\uc758 \uc545\uc131 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc774\uc9c4 \ud30c\uc77c\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uae30\ud638\uac00 \uc81c\uac70\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ub9ce\uc740 \ud568\uc218\uac00 \ud3ec\ud568\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uace0, \uc545\uc131 \ud589\ub3d9\uc774 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ucf54\ub4dc \uc601\uc5ed\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \ubd84\uc0b0\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc5b4 TTP \uadc0\uc18d\uc774 \uc5b4\ub835\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc\uc758 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ucf54\ub4dc \uc774\ud574 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uc811 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub370\ub294 \ubd84\uc11d \uc9c4\uc785\uc810 \uc2dd\ubcc4, \ubd80\ubd84 \uad00\uce21\ud558\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f TTP \ud2b9\uc815 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \ub17c\ub9ac\uc640\uc758 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58 \ub4f1\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uae30\ud638\uac00 \uc81c\uac70\ub41c \uc545\uc131 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc774\uc9c4 \ud30c\uc77c\uc5d0\uc11c TTP\ub97c \uc778\uc2dd\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc778 TTPDetect\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

We propose SWIRL, a self-improvement framework that learns from state-only sequences by treating actions as a latent variable and alternating between Forward World Modelling (FWM) $P_\u03b8(Y|X,Z)$ and an Inverse Dynamics Modelling (IDM) $Q_\u03c6(Z|X,Y)$. SWIRL iterates two phases: (1) Variational Information Maximisation, which updates the FWM to generate next states that maximise conditional mutual information with latent actions given prior states, encouraging identifiable consistency; and (2) ELBO Maximisation, which updates the IDM to explain observed transitions, effectively performing coordinate ascent. Both models are trained with reinforcement learning (specifically, GRPO) with the opposite frozen model's log-probability as a reward signal. We provide theoretical learnability guarantees for both updates, and evaluate SWIRL on LLMs and VLMs across multiple environments: single-turn and multi-turn open-world visual dynamics and synthetic textual environments for physics, web, and tool calling.

These protocols replace interactive, session-based authorization with cryptographically issued mandates, enabling asynchronous and autonomous execution. While AP2 provides specification-level guarantees through signature verification, explicit binding, and expiration semantics, real-world agentic execution introduces runtime behaviors such as retries, concurrency, and orchestration that challenge implicit assumptions about mandate usage.\n  In this work, we present a security analysis of the AP2 mandate lifecycle and identify enforcement gaps that arise during runtime in agent-based payment systems. We propose a zero-trust runtime verification framework that enforces explicit context binding and consume-once mandate semantics using dynamically generated, time-bound nonces, ensuring that authorization decisions are evaluated at execution time rather than assumed from static issuance properties.\n  Through simulation-based evaluation under high concurrency, we show that context-aware binding and consume-once enforcement address distinct and complementary attack classes, and that both are required to prevent replay and context-redirect attacks. The proposed framework mitigates all evaluated attacks while maintaining stable verification latency of approximately 3.8~ms at throughput levels up to 10{,}000 transactions per second. We further demonstrate that the required runtime state is bounded by peak concurrency rather than cumulative transaction history, indicating that robust runtime security for agentic payment execution can be achieved with minimal and predictable overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \uacb0\uc81c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c AP2 \uc784\ubb34 \uc0dd\uc560 \uc8fc\uae30\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uace0, \uc2e4\ud589 \uc911 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc9d1\ud589 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uba70, \uc81c\ub85c \ud2b8\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ub7f0\ud0c0\uc784 \uac80\uc99d \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc790\uc728 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc0c1\uc5c5\uc801 \uac70\ub798 \uc2e4\ud589 \ub2a5\ub825\uc740 UCP \ubc0f AP2\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc704\uc784 \uae30\ubc18 \uacb0\uc81c \uc2b9\uc778 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc758 \ub3c4\uc785\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "AP2 \uc784\ubb34 \uc0dd\uc560 \uc8fc\uae30\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc9d1\ud589 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0, \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \uc2dc\uac04 \uc81c\ud55c \ub17c\uc2a4\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc81c\ub85c \ud2b8\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ub7f0\ud0c0\uc784 \uac80\uc99d \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc0c1\ud669 \uc778\uc2dd \ubc14\uc778\ub529\uacfc \uc18c\ube44-\ud55c\ubc88 \uc9d1\ud589\uc774 \uc7ac\uc0dd \ubc0f \uc0c1\ud669 \ub9ac\ub514\ub809\uc158 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \uc608\ubc29\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uba70, \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ud3c9\uac00\ub41c \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uac15\ub825\ud55c \ub7f0\ud0c0\uc784 \ubcf4\uc548\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uc9c0\uc18d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc0c1\uc5c5\uc801 \uac70\ub798\ub97c \uc2e4\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc790\uc728 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ubc30\uce58\ub294 \uc720\ub2c8\ubc84\uc124 \uc0c1\uac70\ub798 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c(UCP) \ubc0f \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uacb0\uc81c \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c(AP2)\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uc704\uc784 \uae30\ubc18 \uacb0\uc81c \uc2b9\uc778 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc758 \ucc44\ud0dd\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc740 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uc138\uc158 \uae30\ubc18 \uc2b9\uc778\uc744 \uc554\ud638\ud654\ub41c \uc704\uc784\uc73c\ub85c \ub300\uccb4\ud558\uc5ec \ube44\ub3d9\uae30\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc2e4\ud589\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Existing approaches predominantly rely on fine-tuning multimodal large language models (MLLMs) using large-scale GUI datasets to predict target element coordinates, which is data-intensive and generalizes poorly to unseen interfaces. Recent attention-based alternatives exploit localization signals in MLLMs attention mechanisms without task-specific fine-tuning, but suffer from low reliability due to the lack of explicit and complementary spatial anchors in GUI images. To address this limitation, we propose Trifuse, an attention-based grounding framework that explicitly integrates complementary spatial anchors. Trifuse integrates attention, OCR-derived textual cues, and icon-level caption semantics via a Consensus-SinglePeak (CS) fusion strategy that enforces cross-modal agreement while retaining sharp localization peaks. Extensive evaluations on four grounding benchmarks demonstrate that Trifuse achieves strong performance without task-specific fine-tuning, substantially reducing the reliance on expensive annotated data.

To address a broader range of offline RL settings, we extend flow matching to a general framework that supports discrete action spaces with multiple objectives. Specifically, we replace continuous flows with continuous-time Markov chains, trained using a Q-weighted flow matching objective. We then extend our design to multi-agent settings, mitigating the exponential growth of joint action spaces via a factorized conditional path. We theoretically show that, under idealized conditions, optimizing this objective recovers the optimal policy. Extensive experiments further demonstrate that our method performs robustly in practical scenarios, including high-dimensional control, multi-modal decision-making, and dynamically changing preferences over multiple objectives. Our discrete framework can also be applied to continuous-control problems through action quantization, providing a flexible trade-off between representational complexity and performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5f0\uc18d \ud589\ub3d9 \uacf5\uac04\ub9cc \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\uc0b0 \ud589\ub3d9 \uacf5\uac04\uacfc \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\uc0b0 \ud589\ub3d9 \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc815\ucc45\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \ucee4\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "Q \uac00\uc911\uce58 \ud750\ub984 \uc77c\uce58\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc5f0\uc18d \ud750\ub984 \ub300\uc2e0 \uc5f0\uc18d \uc2dc\uac04 \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uccb4\uc778\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uace0, \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc124\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc870\uac74\ubd80 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc778\uc790\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \uc870\uc778 \ud589\ub3d9 \uacf5\uac04\uc758 \uae30\ud558\uae09\uc218\uc801 \uc131\uc7a5\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uc2dc\ub41c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ucd5c\uc801 \uc815\ucc45\uc73c\ub85c \ud68c\ubcf5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc2e4\uc6a9 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\uc778\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \uc774\uc0b0 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc591\uc790\ud654\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5f0\uc18d \uc81c\uc5b4 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0\ub3c4 \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uc5ec \ud45c\ud604 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uacfc \uc131\ub2a5 \uac04 \uc720\uc5f0\ud55c \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378 \ubc0f \ud750\ub984 \uc77c\uce58\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uc0dd\uc131 \uc815\ucc45\uc740 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc5d0 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uadf8 \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc740 \uc8fc\ub85c \uc5f0\uc18d \ud589\ub3d9 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0 \ud55c\uc815\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 RL \uc124\uc815\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8e8\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \uc774\uc0b0 \ud589\ub3d9 \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c \ud750\ub984 \uc77c\uce58\ub97c \ud655\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5f0\uc18d \ud750\ub984\uc744 Q-\uac00\uc911 \ud750\ub984 \uc77c\uce58 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc5f0\uc18d \uc2dc\uac04 \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uccb4\uc778\uc73c\ub85c \ub300\uccb4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ud6c4 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc124\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uc5ec \uc778\uc790\ud654\ub41c \uc870\uac74\ubd80 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc870\uc778 \ud589\ub3d9 \uacf5\uac04\uc758 \uae30\ud558\uae09\uc218\uc801 \uc131\uc7a5\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \uc870\uac74 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uba74 \ucd5c\uc801 \uc815\ucc45\uc774 \ud68c\ubcf5\ub428\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc740 \ub610\ud55c \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \uc81c\uc5b4, \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \ubc0f \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc120\ud638\ub3c4\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud558\uac8c \uc218\ud589\ub428\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc774\uc0b0 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc591\uc790\ud654\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5f0\uc18d \uc81c\uc5b4 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0\ub3c4 \uc801\uc6a9\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc5b4 \ud45c\ud604 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uacfc \uc131\ub2a5 \uac04 \uc720\uc5f0\ud55c \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial perturbations small, deliberate input modifications that can degrade detection accuracy and compromise interpretability. This paper presents an empirical study of adversarial robustness and explainability drift across two cybersecurity domains phishing URL classification and network intrusion detection. We evaluate the impact of L (infinity) bounded Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) perturbations on model accuracy and introduce a quantitative metric, the Robustness Index (RI), defined as the area under the accuracy perturbation curve. Gradient based feature sensitivity and SHAP based attribution drift analyses reveal which input features are most susceptible to adversarial manipulation. Experiments on the Phishing Websites and UNSW NB15 datasets show consistent robustness trends, with adversarial training improving RI by up to 9 percent while maintaining clean-data accuracy. These findings highlight the coupling between robustness and interpretability degradation and underscore the importance of quantitative evaluation in the design of trustworthy, AI-driven cybersecurity systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uac15\uac74\uc131\uacfc \uc124\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc774 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "L (infinity)\ub85c \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) \ubc0f Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) perturbations\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0, \uc815\ub7c9\uc801 \uc9c0\ud45c\uc778 Robustness Index (RI)\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud6c8\ub828\uc774 RI\ub97c \ucd5c\ub300 9\ud37c\uc13c\ud2b8 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uae68\ub057\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uac15\uac74\uc131\uacfc \uc124\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \uac10\uc18c \uac04\uc758 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uac15\uc870\ud558\uace0, \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 AI \uae30\ubc18 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc124\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ub7c9\uc801 \ud3c9\uac00\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5(ML) \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ud53c\uc2f1 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ubc0f \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uce68\uc785 \ubc29\uc9c0\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc774 \ubc30\ud3ec\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \uc800\ud558\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc190\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc12d\ub3d9, \uc989 \ubbf8\uc138\ud55c \uace0\uc758\uc801 \uc785\ub825 \uc218\uc815\uc5d0 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ucde8\uc57d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc601\uc5ed(\ud53c\uc2f1 URL \ubd84\ub958 \ubc0f \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uce68\uc785 \ud0d0\uc9c0)\uc5d0\uc11c \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uac15\uac74\uc131 \ubc0f \uc124\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \ud3b8\ucc28\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\uc99d\uc801 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 L (infinity)\ub85c \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) \ubc0f Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) \uc12d\ub3d9\uc774 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4 \uc12d\ub3d9 \uace1\uc120 \uc544\ub798 \uc601\uc5ed\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\uc758\ub41c \uc815\ub7c9\uc801 \uc9c0\ud45c\uc778 Robustness Index (RI)\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \ud2b9\uc131 \ubbfc\uac10\ub3c4 \ubc0f SHAP \uae30\ubc18 \uc18d\uc131 \ud3b8\ucc28 \ubd84\uc11d\uc740 \uc5b4\ub5a4 \uc785\ub825 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc774 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc870\uc791\uc5d0 \uac00\uc7a5 \ucde8\uc57d\ud55c\uc9c0 \ubc1d\ud600\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

In this paper, we present the first systematic study on training agentic models at the 4B-parameter scale. We identify three primary bottlenecks hindering the performance of edge-scale models: catastrophic forgetting during Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), sensitivity to reward signal noise during Reinforcement Learning (RL), and reasoning degradation caused by redundant information in long-context scenarios. To address the issues, we propose AgentCPM-Explore, a compact 4B agent model with high knowledge density and strong exploration capability. We introduce a holistic training framework featuring parameter-space model fusion, reward signal denoising, and contextual information refinement. Through deep exploration, AgentCPM-Explore achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among 4B-class models, matches or surpasses 8B-class SOTA models on four benchmarks, and even outperforms larger-scale models such as Claude-4.5-Sonnet or DeepSeek-v3.2 in five benchmarks. Notably, AgentCPM-Explore achieves 97.09% accuracy on GAIA text-based tasks under pass@64. These results provide compelling evidence that the bottleneck for edge-scale models is not their inherent capability ceiling, but rather their inference stability. Based on our well-established training framework, AgentCPM-Explore effectively unlocks the significant, yet previously underestimated, potential of edge-scale models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8

While this has inspired new research into low-rank training, compression, and adaptation, theoretical justification for these dynamics in nonlinear networks remains limited. %compared to deep linear settings. To address this gap, this paper analyzes the learning dynamics of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) under gradient descent (GD). We demonstrate that the weight dynamics concentrate within invariant low-dimensional subspaces throughout training. Theoretically, we precisely characterize these invariant subspaces for two-layer networks with smooth nonlinear activations, providing insight into their emergence. Experimentally, we validate that this phenomenon extends beyond our theoretical assumptions. Leveraging these insights, we empirically show there exists a low-rank MLP parameterization that, when initialized within the appropriate subspaces, matches the classification performance of fully-parameterized counterparts on a variety of classification tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \ud558\uac15\ubc95 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uce35 \ud37c\uc149\ud2b8\ub860(MLP)\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uba70, \ud6c8\ub828 \ub3d9\uc548 \uac00\ubcc0\uc801 \uc800\ucc28\uc6d0 \ubd80\ubd84\uacf5\uac04 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uac00\uc911\uce58 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc774 \uc9d1\uc911\ub428\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc2ec\uce35 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc758 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc774 \uc800\ucc28\uc6d0 \ubd80\ubd84\uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \ucd5c\uadfc\uc758 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \uc99d\uac70\uac00 \ubc1c\uacac\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\ub098 \ube44\uc120\ud615 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc815\ub2f9\ud654\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \ud558\uac15\ubc95 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uce35 \ud37c\uc149\ud2b8\ub860(MLP)\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0, \ub450 \uce35 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub9e4\ub044\ub7ec\uc6b4 \ube44\uc120\ud615 \ud65c\uc131\ud654\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubd88\ubcc0 \uc800\ucc28\uc6d0 \ubd80\ubd84\uacf5\uac04\uc744 \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \uc815\uc758\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uac00\uc911\uce58 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc774 \ud6c8\ub828 \uacfc\uc815 \ub0b4\ub0b4 \ubd88\ubcc0 \uc800\ucc28\uc6d0 \ubd80\ubd84\uacf5\uac04\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\ub418\uace0, \uc774 \ud604\uc0c1\uc774 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uac00\uc815 \uc774\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ub428\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc801\uc808\ud55c \ubd80\ubd84\uacf5\uac04 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd08\uae30\ud654\ub41c \uc800\ub7ad\ud06c MLP \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ud654\uac00 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubd84\ub958 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc644\uc804 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\uac00 \ub2ec\ub9b0 \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uacfc \ub3d9\ub4f1\ud55c \ubd84\ub958 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc784\uc744 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc\uc758 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \uc99d\uac70\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc2ec\uce35 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc758 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc774 \uc800\ucc28\uc6d0 \ubd80\ubd84\uacf5\uac04 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc800\ub7ad\ud06c \ud6c8\ub828, \uc555\ucd95 \ubc0f \uc801\uc751\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ucd09\ubc1c\ud588\uc9c0\ub9cc \ube44\uc120\ud615 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc815\ub2f9\ud654\ub294 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774 \uac04\uadf9\uc744 \ud574\uc18c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \ud558\uac15\ubc95(GD) \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uce35 \ud37c\uc149\ud2b8\ub860(MLP)\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac00\uc911\uce58 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc774 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub0b4\ub0b4 \ubd88\ubcc0 \uc800\ucc28\uc6d0 \ubd80\ubd84\uacf5\uac04\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\ub428\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub9e4\ub044\ub7ec\uc6b4 \ube44\uc120\ud615 \ud65c\uc131\ud654\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \ub450 \uce35 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubd88\ubcc0 \ubd80\ubd84\uacf5\uac04\uc744 \uc815\ud655\ud788 \uc815\uc758\ud558\uc5ec \uadf8 \ubc1c\uc0dd\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \ud604\uc0c1\uc774 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uac00\uc815 \uc774\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ub428\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc801\uc808\ud55c \ubd80\ubd84\uacf5\uac04 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd08\uae30\ud654\ud560 \ub54c \uc800\ub7ad\ud06c MLP \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ud654\uac00 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubd84\ub958 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc644\uc804 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ubd84\ub958 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \uc77c\uce58\ud568\uc744 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4."}}

Current safety measures predominantly focus on static input/output filtering. However, we argue that ensuring LLM agents reliability requires auditing the intermediate execution process. In this work, we formulate the task of Trajectory Anomaly Detection. The goal is not merely detection, but precise error localization. This capability is essential for enabling efficient rollback-and-retry. To achieve this, we construct TrajBench, a dataset synthesized via a perturb-and-complete strategy to cover diverse procedural anomalies. Using this benchmark, we investigate the capability of models in process supervision. We observe that general-purpose LLMs, even with zero-shot prompting, struggle to identify and localize these anomalies. This reveals that generalized capabilities do not automatically translate to process reliability. To address this, we propose TrajAD, a specialized verifier trained with fine-grained process supervision.

Static rubrics provide rigorous, reproducible assessment but fail to accommodate diverse valid response strategies, while LLM-as-a-judge approaches adapt to individual responses yet suffer from instability and bias. Human experts address this dilemma by combining domain-grounded principles with dynamic, claim-level assessment. Inspired by this process, we propose JADE, a two-layer evaluation framework. Layer 1 encodes expert knowledge as a predefined set of evaluation skills, providing stable evaluation criteria. Layer 2 performs report-specific, claim-level evaluation to flexibly assess diverse reasoning strategies, with evidence-dependency gating to invalidate conclusions built on refuted claims. Experiments on BizBench show that JADE improves evaluation stability and reveals critical agent failure modes missed by holistic LLM-based evaluators. We further demonstrate strong alignment with expert-authored rubrics and effective transfer to a medical-domain benchmark, validating JADE across professional domains.

These attacks are not incidental. Malicious skills average 4.03 vulnerabilities across a median of three kill chain phases, and the ecosystem has split into two archetypes: Data Thieves that exfiltrate credentials through supply chain techniques, and Agent Hijackers that subvert agent decision-making through instruction manipulation. A single actor accounts for 54.1\\% of confirmed cases through templated brand impersonation. Shadow features, capabilities absent from public documentation, appear in 0\\% of basic attacks but 100\\% of advanced ones; several skills go further by exploiting the AI platform's own hook system and permission flags.

Most existing approaches follow a plan-then-write paradigm, whose performance heavily depends on the quality of the initial outline. However, constructing a comprehensive outline itself demands strong reasoning ability, causing current deep research systems to rely almost exclusively on closed-source or online large models. This reliance raises practical barriers to deployment and introduces safety and privacy concerns for user-authored data. In this work, we present AgentCPM-Report, a lightweight yet high-performing local solution composed of a framework that mirrors the human writing process and an 8B-parameter deep research agent. Our framework uses a Writing As Reasoning Policy (WARP), which enables models to dynamically revise outlines during report generation. Under this policy, the agent alternates between Evidence-Based Drafting and Reasoning-Driven Deepening, jointly supporting information acquisition, knowledge refinement, and iterative outline evolution.

In this work, we propose a novel framework, ATEX-CF that unifies adversarial attack techniques with counterfactual explanation generation-a connection made feasible by their shared goal of flipping a node's prediction, yet differing in perturbation strategy: adversarial attacks often rely on edge additions, while counterfactual methods typically use deletions. Unlike traditional approaches that treat explanation and attack separately, our method efficiently integrates both edge additions and deletions, grounded in theory, leveraging adversarial insights to explore impactful counterfactuals. In addition, by jointly optimizing fidelity, sparsity, and plausibility under a constrained perturbation budget, our method produces instance-level explanations that are both informative and realistic.

Since suffixes are free-form text, they admit endlessly many surface forms, making jailbreak mitigation difficult. Most existing defenses depend on passive detection of suspicious suffixes, without leveraging the defender's inherent asymmetric ability to inject secrets and proactively conceal gaps. Motivated by this, we take a controllability-oriented perspective and develop a proactive defense that nudges attackers into a no-win dilemma: either they fall into defender-designed optimization traps and fail to produce an effective adversarial suffix, or they can succeed only by generating adversarial suffixes that carry distinctive, traceable fingerprints. We propose TrapSuffix, a lightweight fine-tuning approach that injects trap-aligned behaviors into the base model without changing the inference pipeline. TrapSuffix channels jailbreak attempts into these two outcomes by reshaping the model's response landscape to adversarial suffixes. Across diverse suffix-based jailbreak settings, TrapSuffix reduces the average attack success rate to below 0.01 percent and achieves an average tracing success rate of 87.9 percent, providing both strong defense and reliable traceability. It introduces no inference-time overhead and incurs negligible memory cost, requiring only 15.87 MB of additional memory on average, whereas state-of-the-art LLM-based detection defenses typically incur memory overheads at the 1e4 MB level, while composing naturally with existing filtering-based defenses for complementary protection.", "AI": {"tldr": "TrapSuffix\ub294 \uc545\uc131 \uc811\ubbf8\uc0ac\ub97c \ubc29\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub3d9 \ubc29\uc5b4\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec, \uacf5\uaca9\uc790\uac00 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ud568\uc815\uc5d0 \ube60\uc9c0\uac8c \ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc2dd\ubcc4 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc811\ubbf8\uc0ac\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\uc5ec \uacf5\uaca9 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \ub0ae\ucd94\uace0 \ucd94\uc801 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc778\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 \ubc29\uc5b4\ub294 \uacf5\uaca9\uc790\uc758 \uc811\ubbf8\uc0ac\ub97c \uc218\ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ube44\ub300\uce6d \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc0ac\uc804 \ubc29\uc5b4\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc0c1\ud669\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "TrapSuffix\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc751\ub2f5 \uacbd\uad00\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \uacf5\uaca9\uc790\ub97c \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uacb0\uacfc\ub85c \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ub7c9\ud654\ub41c \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc774\ub2e4.", "result": "TrapSuffix\ub294 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 0.01% \uc774\ud558\ub85c \uc904\uc774\uace0, \ucd94\uc801 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 87.9%\ub85c \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "TrapSuffix\ub294 \ucd94\uac00\uc801\uc778 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \uc18c\ub7c9\uc774\uba70, \uae30\uc874 \ud544\ud130\ub9c1 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\uc5b4\uc640 \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7fd\uac8c \uacb0\ud569\ub418\uc5b4 \ubcf4\uc644\uc801\uc778 \ubcf4\ud638\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc811\ubbf8\uc0ac\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \ud0c8\uc625 \uacf5\uaca9\uc740 \uc801\ub300\uc801\uc778 \uc811\ubbf8\uc0ac, \uc989 \uc9e7\uc740 \ud1a0\ud070 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\ub97c \ucd94\uac00\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\ub82c\ub41c \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \uc548\uc804\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ucd9c\ub825\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\ub3c4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc811\ubbf8\uc0ac\ub294 \uc790\uc720 \ud615\uc2dd\uc758 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc774\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \ub05d\uc5c6\uc774 \ub9ce\uc740 \ud45c\uba74 \ud615\ud0dc\ub97c \ud5c8\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud0c8\uc625 \ubc29\uc9c0\ub97c \uc5b4\ub835\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4ed\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\uc5b4\ub294 \uc218\uc0c1\ud55c \uc811\ubbf8\uc0ac\ub97c \uc218\ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uba70, \ubc29\uc5b4\uc790\uac00 \ube44\ub300\uce6d \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ube44\ubc00\uc744 \uc8fc\uc785\ud558\uace0 \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac04\uadf9\uc744 \uc228\uae30\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \uad00\uc810\uc744 \ucde8\ud558\uace0 \uacf5\uaca9\uc790\ub97c \uc774\uae38 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \ub51c\ub808\ub9c8\ub85c \ub204\ub974\ub294 \ub2a5\ub3d9 \ubc29\uc5b4\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uacf5\uaca9\uc790\ub294 \ubc29\uc5b4\uc790\uac00 \uc124\uacc4\ud55c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ud568\uc815\uc5d0 \ube60\uc838 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc811\ubbf8\uc0ac\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uac70\ub098, \uace0\uc720\ud558\uace0 \ucd94\uc801 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc9c0\ubb38\uc744 \ub2f4\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \uacf5\uaca9\uc801 \uc811\ubbf8\uc0ac\ub9cc \uc0dd\uc131\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc131\uacf5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 TrapSuffix\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\ub294\ub370, \uc774\ub294 \uae30\ubcf8 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ud568\uc815 \uc815\ub82c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc8fc\uc785\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ub7c9\ud654\ub41c \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c, \ucd94\ub860 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \ubcc0\uacbd\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0\ub3c4 \uc218\ud589\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, existing backbone RL algorithms lack verified convergence guarantees in agentic scenarios, especially in multi-turn settings, which can lead to training instability and failure to converge to optimal policies.\n  In this paper, we systematically analyze how different combinations of policy update mechanisms and advantage estimation methods affect convergence properties in single/multi-turn scenarios. We find that REINFORCE with Group Relative Advantage Estimation (GRAE) can converge to the globally optimal under undiscounted conditions, but the combination of PPO & GRAE breaks PPO's original monotonic improvement property. Furthermore, we demonstrate that mainstream backbone RL algorithms cannot simultaneously achieve both critic-free and convergence guarantees in multi-turn scenarios.\n  To address this, we propose SeeUPO (Sequence-level Sequential Update Policy Optimization), a critic-free approach with convergence guarantees for multi-turn interactions. SeeUPO models multi-turn interaction as sequentially executed multi-agent bandit problems.

In this work we present the Laser Processing Fourier Neural Operator (LP-FNO), a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) based surrogate model that learns the parametric solution operator of various laser processes from multiphysics simulations generated with FLOW-3D WELD (registered trademark). Through a novel approach of reformulating the transient problem in the moving laser frame and applying temporal averaging, the system results in a quasi-steady state setting suitable for operator learning, even in the keyhole welding regime. The proposed LP-FNO maps process parameters to three-dimensional temperature fields and melt-pool boundaries across a broad process window spanning conduction and keyhole regimes using the non-dimensional normalized enthalpy formulation. The model achieves temperature prediction errors on the order of 1% and intersection-over-union scores for melt-pool segmentation over 0.9. We demonstrate that a LP-FNO model trained on coarse-resolution data can be evaluated on finer grids, yielding accurate super-resolved predictions in mesh-converged conduction regimes, whereas discrepancies in keyhole regimes reflect unresolved dynamics in the coarse-mesh training data. These results indicate that the LP-FNO provides an efficient surrogate modeling framework for laser welding, enabling prediction of full three-dimensional fields and phase interfaces over wide parameter ranges in just tens of milliseconds, up to a hundred thousand times faster than traditional Finite Volume multi-physics software.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294

In this work, we argue that this assumption is insufficient. We introduce a representation-aware and frequency-aware evaluation framework that measures internal embedding drift, spectral sensitivity, and structural smoothness (spatial consistency of vision tokens), alongside standard label-based metrics. Applying this framework to modern VLMs across the SEEDBench, MMMU, and POPE datasets reveals three distinct failure modes. First, models frequently preserve predicted answers while undergoing substantial internal representation drift; for perturbations such as text overlays, this drift approaches the magnitude of inter-image variability, indicating that representations move to regions typically occupied by unrelated inputs despite unchanged outputs. Second, robustness does not improve with scale; larger models achieve higher accuracy but exhibit equal or greater sensitivity, consistent with sharper yet more fragile decision boundaries. Third, we find that perturbations affect tasks differently: they harm reasoning when they disrupt how models combine coarse and fine visual cues, but on the hallucination benchmarks, they can reduce false positives by making models generate more conservative answers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774\ubc88 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ube44\uc804 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(VLM)\uc758 \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud3c9\uac00 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \ub0b4\ubd80 \ud45c\ud604\uc758 \ub4dc\ub9ac\ud504\ud2b8\uc640 \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc \uac10\ub3c4, \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ub9e4\ub044\ub7ec\uc6c0\uc744 \uce21\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 VLM \uac15\uac74\uc131 \ud3c9\uac00\ub294 \ucd9c\ub825 \uc218\uc900 \ubd88\ubcc0\uc131\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc9c0\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc608\uce21\uc774 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ucc98\ub9ac\ub97c \ubc18\uc601\ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \uac00\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uac00\uc815\uc774 \ubd88\ucda9\ubd84\ud558\ub2e4\uace0 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub0b4\ubd80 \uc784\ubca0\ub529 \ub4dc\ub9ac\ud504\ud2b8, \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7f4 \uac10\ub3c4, \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ub9e4\ub044\ub7ec\uc6c0(\ube44\uc804 \ud1a0\ud070\uc758 \uacf5\uac04\uc801 \uc77c\uad00\uc131)\uc744 \uce21\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ud45c\ud604 \uc778\uc2dd \ubc0f \uc8fc\ud30c\uc218 \uc778\uc2dd \ud3c9\uac00 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "SEEDBench, MMMU, \ubc0f POPE \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \ud604\ub300 VLM\uc5d0 \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc801\uc6a9\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uad6c\ubcc4\ub418\ub294 \uc2e4\ud328 \ubaa8\ub4dc\ub97c \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 VLM\uc758 \uac15\uac74\uc131 \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ub300\ud45c\uc131\uacfc \uc624\ub958 \ubc1c\uc0dd \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc774\ud574\ub97c \uc2ec\ud654\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ube44\uc804 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(VLM)\uc758 \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd9c\ub825 \uc218\uc900 \ubd88\ubcc0\uc131\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud3c9\uac00\ub418\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc608\uce21\uc774 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ucc98\ub9ac\ub97c \ubc18\uc601\ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \uc554\uc2dc\ud558\ub294 \uac00\uc815\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774 \uac00\uc815\uc774 \ubd88\ucda9\ubd84\ud558\ub2e4\uace0 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub0b4\ubd80 \uc784\ubca0\ub529 \ub4dc\ub9ac\ud504\ud2b8, \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc \uac10\ub3c4 \ubc0f \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ub9e4\ub044\ub7ec\uc6c0(\ube44\uc804 \ud1a0\ud070\uc758 \uacf5\uac04\uc801 \uc77c\uad00\uc131)\uc744 \uce21\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ud45c\ud604 \uc778\uc9c0 \ubc0f \uc8fc\ud30c\uc218 \uc778\uc2dd \ud3c9\uac00 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ud45c\uc900 \ub808\uc774\ube14 \uae30\ubc18 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uacfc \uac19\uc774 \uc801\uc6a9\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.

For example, given a classifier that determines loan approval based on credit scores, applicants may open or close credit cards and bank accounts to obtain a positive prediction. The learning goal is to achieve low mistake or regret bounds despite such strategic behavior.\n  While randomized algorithms have the potential to offer advantages to the learner in strategic settings, they have been largely underexplored. In the realizable setting, no lower bound is known for randomized algorithms, and existing lower bound constructions for deterministic learners can be circumvented by randomization. In the agnostic setting, the best known regret upper bound is $O(T^{3/4}\\log^{1/4}T|\\mathcal H|)$, which is far from the standard online learning rate of $O(\\sqrt{T\\log|\\mathcal H|})$.\n  In this work, we provide refined bounds for online strategic classification in both settings. In the realizable setting, we extend, for $T > \\mathrm{Ldim}(\\mathcal{H}) \u0394^2$, the existing lower bound $\u03a9(\\mathrm{Ldim}(\\mathcal{H}) \u0394)$ for deterministic learners to all learners. This yields the first lower bound that applies to randomized learners. We also provide the first randomized learner that improves the known (deterministic) upper bound of $O(\\mathrm{Ldim}(\\mathcal H) \\cdot \u0394\\log \u0394)$.\n  In the agnostic setting, we give a proper learner using convex optimization techniques to improve the regret upper bound to $O(\\sqrt{T \\log |\\mathcal{H}|} + |\\mathcal{H}| \\log(T|\\mathcal{H}|))$. We show a matching lower bound up to logarithmic factors for all proper learning rules, demonstrating the optimality of our learner among proper learners.

We consider tasks specified as linear temporal logic (LTL) formulae, which are commonly used in formal methods to specify properties of systems, and have recently been successfully adopted in RL. In this setting, we present a novel task embedding technique leveraging a new generation of semantic LTL-to-automata translations, originally developed for temporal synthesis. The resulting semantically labelled automata contain rich, structured information in each state that allow us to (i) compute the automaton efficiently on-the-fly, (ii) extract expressive task embeddings used to condition the policy, and (iii) naturally support full LTL. Experimental results in a variety of domains demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance and is able to scale to complex specifications where existing methods fail.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub2e8\uc77c \ubcf4\ud3b8\uc801\uc778 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc791\uc5c5 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c, \ubbf8\uc9c0\uc758 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub2e8\uc77c \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc120\ud615 \uc2dc\uac04 \ub17c\ub9ac(LTL) \uacf5\uc2dd\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc815\uc758\ud558\uace0, \uc2dc\uac04 \ud569\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uac1c\ubc1c\ub41c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 LTL-\uc624\ud1a0\ub9c8\ud0c0 \ubc88\uc5ed\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5 \uc784\ubca0\ub529 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \ubcf8 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc774 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uace0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc0ac\uc591\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc2e4\ud328\ud558\ub294 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud568\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc870\uac74\ud654\ud558\uace0, LTL\uc758 \uc644\uc804\ud55c \uc9c0\uc6d0\uc744 \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7fd\uac8c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e8\uc77c, \ubcf4\ud3b8\uc801\uc778 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uc5ec \uc784\uc758\uc758, \uc544\ub9c8\ub3c4 \ubcf4\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc124\uc815\uc778 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc791\uc5c5 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \uc9c0\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \uc120\ud615 \uc2dc\uac04 \ub17c\ub9ac(LTL) \uacf5\uc2dd\uc744 \uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \uace0\ub824\ud558\uba70, \ucd5c\uadfc RL\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucc44\ud0dd\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc2dc\uac04 \ud569\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc6d0\ub798 \uac1c\ubc1c\ub41c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc138\ub300\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc801 LTL-\uc790\ub3d9\ucc28 \ubcc0\ud658\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc784\ubca0\ub529 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacb0\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub808\uc774\ube14\uc774 \uc9c0\uc815\ub41c \uc624\ud1a0\ub9c8\ud0c0\ub294 \uac01 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0 \ud48d\ubd80\ud558\uace0 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uc5ec (i) \uc790\ub3d9\uc790\ub97c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc628\ub514\ub9e8\ub4dc\ub85c \uacc4\uc0b0\ud558\uace0, (ii) \uc815\ucc45 \uc870\uac74\uc5d0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \ud45c\ud604\uc801\uc778 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc744 \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\uba70, (iii) \uc644\uc804\ud55c LTL\uc744 \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7fd\uac8c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc2e4\ud328\ud558\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc0ac\uc591\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud655\uc7a5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Motivated by privacy-preserving browser APIs and the deprecation of third-party cookies, we study a setting where the learner observes a sequence of clicks and a sequence of conversions, but can only link a conversion to a set of candidate clicks (an attribution set) rather than a unique source. We formalize this as learning from attribution sets generated by an oblivious adversary equipped with a prior distribution over the candidates. Despite the lack of explicit labels, we construct an unbiased estimator of the population loss from these coarse signals via a novel approach. Leveraging this estimator, we show that Empirical Risk Minimization achieves generalization guarantees that scale with the informativeness of the prior and is also robust against estimation errors in the prior, despite complex dependencies among attribution sets. Simple empirical evaluations on standard datasets suggest our unbiased approach significantly outperforms common industry heuristics, particularly in regimes where attribution sets are large or overlapping.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uad11\uace0 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \uc81c\uc57d \ud558\uc758 \ubcc0\ud658 \uc608\uce21 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uace0, \ud074\ub9ad\uacfc \ubcc0\ud658 \uac04\uc758 \uc9c1\uc811 \ub9c1\ud06c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub300\uc2e0 \uae30\uc5ec \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubcc0\ud658\uc744 \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ucc44\ud0dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ube0c\ub77c\uc6b0\uc800 API\uc640 \uc11c\ub4dc\ud30c\ud2f0 \ucfe0\ud0a4\uc758 \uc911\ub2e8\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ub3d9\uae30 \ubd80\uc5ec\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uae30\uc5ec \uc9d1\ud569\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc2e4\ud328\ud55c \uc801\ub300\uc790\uac00 \ud6c4\ubcf4\ub4e4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0ac\uc804 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub85c \uc7a5\ube44\ub97c \uac16\ucd98 \uc0c1\ud669\uc73c\ub85c \ud615\uc2dd\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc2e0\ud638\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ubaa8\uc9d1\ub2e8 \uc190\uc2e4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud3b8\ud5a5\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ucd94\uc815\uae30\ub97c \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \uc704\ud5d8 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\uac00 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uac00 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \uc0b0\uc5c5\uc758 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub41c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uad11\uace0 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \uc81c\uc57d \ud558\uc5d0 \ubcc0\ud658 \uc608\uce21 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8f9\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uacbd\uc6b0 \uad11\uace0 \ud074\ub9ad\uacfc \ubcc0\ud658 \uac04\uc758 \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc778 \ub9c1\ud06c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ube0c\ub77c\uc6b0\uc800 API\uc640 \uc81c3\uc790 \ucfe0\ud0a4\uc758 \uc911\ub2e8\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ub3d9\uae30 \ubd80\uc5ec\ub418\uc5b4, \ud559\uc2b5\uc790\ub294 \ud074\ub9ad \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\uc640 \ubcc0\ud658 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\ub97c \uad00\ucc30\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubcc0\ud658\uc744 \uace0\uc720\ud55c \uc18c\uc2a4\uac00 \uc544\ub2cc \ud6c4\ubcf4 \ud074\ub9ad \uc9d1\ud569(\uae30\uc5ec \uc9d1\ud569)\uacfc\ub9cc \uc5f0\uacb0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc124\uc815\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\ub97c \ud6c4\ubcf4\ub4e4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0ac\uc804 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub85c \uc7a5\ube44\ub97c \uac16\ucd98 \ubb34\uad00\uc2ec\ud55c \uc801\ub300\uc790\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \uae30\uc5ec \uc9d1\ud569\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5\uc73c\ub85c \ud615\uc2dd\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc778 \ub808\uc774\ube14\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud568\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc870\uc7a1\ud55c \uc2e0\ud638\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ubaa8\uc9d1\ub2e8 \uc190\uc2e4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud3b8\ud5a5\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ucd94\uc815\uae30\ub97c \uad6c\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ucd94\uc815\uae30\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \uc704\ud5d8 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\uac00 \uc0ac\uc804\uc758 \uc815\ubcf4\uc131\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ud655\uc7a5\ub418\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uae30\uc5ec \uc9d1\ud569 \uac04\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc885\uc18d\uc131\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \uc0ac\uc804\uc758 \ucd94\uc815 \uc624\ub958\uc5d0 \uac15\uac74\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud45c\uc900 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \ud3c9\uac00 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud3b8\ud5a5\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \ud2b9\ud788 \uae30\uc5ec \uc9d1\ud569\uc774 \ud06c\uac70\ub098 \uc911\ucca9\ub418\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uc5d0 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uc0b0\uc5c5\uc801\uc778 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Sparse attention reduces this cost by restricting computation to a subset of tokens, but its effectiveness depends critically on efficient scoring and selection of relevant tokens at inference time. We revisit Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) as a sparsification primitive and introduce SOCKET, a SOft Collision Kernel EsTimator that replaces hard bucket matches with probabilistic, similarity-aware aggregation. Our key insight is that hard LSH produces discrete collision signals and is therefore poorly suited for ranking. In contrast, soft LSH aggregates graded collision evidence across hash tables, preserving the stability of relative ordering among the true top-$k$ tokens. This transformation elevates LSH from a candidate-generation heuristic to a principled and mathematically grounded scoring kernel for sparse attention. Leveraging this property, SOCKET enables efficient token selection without ad-hoc voting mechanism, and matches or surpasses established sparse attention baselines across multiple long-context benchmarks using diverse set of models. With a custom CUDA kernel for scoring keys and a Flash Decode Triton backend for sparse attention, SOCKET achieves up to 1.5$\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention, making it an effective tool for long-context inference.

To avoid the intractability of equilibrium computation in open-ended text spaces, we model each agent's action as a mixture over human subpopulations. Agents choose actively and strategically which groups to align with, yielding an interpretable and behaviorally substantive policy class. We derive closed-form NE characterizations, adopting standard concave-utility assumptions to enable analytical system-level predictions and give explicit, actionable guidance for shifting alignment targets toward socially desirable outcomes. The method functions as an active alignment layer on top of existing alignment pipelines such as RLHF. In a social-media setting, we show that a population of LLMs, especially reasoning-based models, may exhibit political exclusion, pathologies where some subpopulations are ignored by all LLM agents, which can be avoided by our method, illustrating the promise of applying the method to regulate multi-agent LLM dynamics across domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\uace0 \uc870\uc815\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uac8c\uc784 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\uace0 \uc870\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubc14\ub78c\uc9c1\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\uac01 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc778\uac04 \ud558\uc704 \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud63c\ud569\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uc5ec \uade0\ud615 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \ud53c\ud558\uace0, \ub2f7\uc9c0 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ud2b9\ud788 \ud2b9\uc815 \ud558\uc704 \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc774 \ubaa8\ub4e0 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ubb34\uc2dc\ub418\ub294 \uc815\uce58\uc801 \ubc30\uc81c\ub97c \ubc29\uc9c0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 LLM \uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uc870\uc808\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc720\ub9dd\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub0b4\uc2dc \uade0\ud615(NE) \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\uace0 \uc870\uc815\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uac8c\uc784 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uac1c\ubc29\ud615 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uade0\ud615 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc758 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \ud53c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uac01\uac01\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc778\uac04 \ud558\uc704 \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud63c\ud569\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc801\uadf9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5b4\ub5a4 \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc5d0 \uc815\ub82c\ud560\uc9c0\ub97c \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\uc5ec \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \ud589\ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc815\ucc45 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud45c\uc900 \uc624\ubaa9 \ud6a8\uc6a9 \uac00\uc815\uc744 \ucc44\ud0dd\ud558\uc5ec \ubd84\uc11d\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc218\uc900 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uace0 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubc14\ub78c\uc9c1\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ud5a5\ud55c \uc815\ub82c \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uc804\ud658\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc9c0\uce68\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \ub2f7\uc9c0 \uade0\ud615 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 RLHF\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uae30\uc874 \uc815\ub82c \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uc704\uc758 \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \uc815\ub82c \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\ub85c \uc791\ub3d9\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc18c\uc15c \ubbf8\ub514\uc5b4 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 LLM\uc758 \uc9d1\ub2e8, \ud2b9\ud788 \ucd94\ub860 \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc815\uce58\uc801 \ubc30\uc81c\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0bc \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ud2b9\uc815 \ud558\uc704 \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc774 \ubaa8\ub4e0 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ubb34\uc2dc\ub418\ub294 \ubcd1\ub9ac \ud604\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ud53c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 LLM \uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uc870\uc808\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud560 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4."}}

Existing remedies face a dichotomy: gradient surgery methods offer geometric safety but incur prohibitive computational costs via online projections, while efficient data selection approaches reduce overhead but remain blind to conflict-inducing gradient directions. In this paper, we propose Orthogonal Gradient Selection (OGS), a data-centric method that harmonizes domain performance, general capability retention, and training efficiency. OGS shifts the geometric insights of gradient projection from the optimizer to the data selection stage by treating data selection as a constrained decision-making process. By leveraging a lightweight Navigator model and reinforcement learning techniques, OGS dynamically identifies training samples whose gradients are orthogonal to a general-knowledge anchor. This approach ensures naturally safe updates for target models without modifying the optimizer or incurring runtime projection costs. Experiments across medical, legal, and financial domains demonstrate that OGS achieves excellent results, significantly improving domain performance and training efficiency while maintaining or even enhancing performance on general tasks such as GSM8K.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uacbd\ub7c9 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc804\ubb38\uc131\uacfc \uc77c\ubc18\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud2b9\ud654\ub41c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucd94\uc5b4 \uc870\uc815\ud560 \ub54c, \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc804\ubb38\uc131\uacfc \uc77c\ubc18\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825 \uac04\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "Orthogonal Gradient Selection (OGS)\ub77c\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc131\ub2a5, \uc77c\ubc18 \ub2a5\ub825 \uc720\uc9c0 \ubc0f \ud6c8\ub828 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uc870\ud654\ub86d\uac8c \ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "OGS\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uae30\uc900\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc9c1\uad50\ud558\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \uc548\uc804\ud558\uac8c \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc OGS\uac00 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc131\ub2a5 \ubc0f \ud6c8\ub828 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc77c\ubc18 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \uc804\ubb38\ud654\ub41c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucd94\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc804\ubb38\uc131\uc744 \uc2b5\ub4dd\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uacfc \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uac83 \uc0ac\uc774\uc758 \uc808\ucda9\uc744 \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \uce58\uba85\uc801\uc778 \ub9dd\uac01(catatronic forgetting)\uc774\ub77c\uace0 \ud55c\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc740 \ub2e4\uc74c\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc591\ubd84\ub41c \uc120\ud0dd\uc9c0\ub97c \uac16\ub294\ub2e4: \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uc218\uc220 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801\uc778 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ud504\ub85c\uc81d\uc158\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub9c9\ub300\ud55c \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \ubc1c\uc0dd\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0, \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc120\ud0dd \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c \uc904\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc \uac08\ub4f1\uc744 \uc720\ubc1c\ud558\ub294 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \ub208\uc774 \uba40\uc5b4 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc131\ub2a5, \uc77c\ubc18 \ub2a5\ub825 \uc720\uc9c0 \ubc0f \ud6c8\ub828 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uc870\ud654\ub86d\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 \uc9c1\uad50 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uc120\ud0dd(OGS)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled agentic AI systems whose behaviour unfolds over multi-step trajectories. In these settings, success and failure are determined by sequences of decisions rather than a single output. While useful, it remains unclear how explanation approaches designed for static predictions translate to agentic settings where behaviour emerges over time. In this work, we bridge the gap between static and agentic explainability by comparing attribution-based explanations with trace-based diagnostics across both settings. To make this distinction explicit, we empirically compare attribution-based explanations used in static classification tasks with trace-based diagnostics used in agentic benchmarks (TAU-bench Airline and AssistantBench). Our results show that while attribution methods achieve stable feature rankings in static settings (Spearman $\u03c1= 0.86$), they cannot be applied reliably to diagnose execution-level failures in agentic trajectories. In contrast, trace-grounded rubric evaluation for agentic settings consistently localizes behaviour breakdowns and reveals that state tracking inconsistency is 2.7$\\times$ more prevalent in failed runs and reduces success probability by 49\\%. These findings motivate a shift towards trajectory-level explainability for agentic systems when evaluating and diagnosing autonomous AI behaviour.\n  Resources:\n

We show that the minimax regret for this problem is $\\tilde\u0398(\\sqrt{(\u03c1^{-1/2}+K/N)T})$, where $T$ is the horizon, $K$ is the number of actions, and $\u03c1$ is the spectral gap of the communication matrix. Our algorithm, based on a novel black-box reduction to bandits with delayed feedback, requires agents to communicate only through gossip. It achieves an upper bound that significantly improves over the previous best bound $\\tilde{O}(\u03c1^{-1/3}(KT)^{2/3})$ of Yi and Vojnovic (2023). We complement this result with a matching lower bound, showing that the problem's difficulty decomposes into a communication cost $\u03c1^{-1/4}\\sqrt{T}$ and a bandit cost $\\sqrt{KT/N}$. We further demonstrate the versatility of our approach by deriving first-order and best-of-both-worlds bounds in the distributed adversarial setting. Finally, we extend our framework to distributed linear bandits in $R^d$, obtaining a regret bound of $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{(\u03c1^{-1/2}+1/N)dT})$, achieved with only $O(d)$ communication cost per agent and per round via a volumetric spanner.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ubc34\ub527\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uba70, $N$\uba85\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \ub85c\uceec \uc190\uc2e4\ub9cc \uad00\ucc30\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ud3c9\uade0 \uc190\uc2e4\uc744 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud611\ub825\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubd84\uc0b0 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ubc34\ub527 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uae4a\uc740 \uc774\ud574\uc640 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ucf00\uc774\uc158 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc9c0\uc5f0 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \ubc34\ub527\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 \ucd95\uc18c\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uc5ec, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc7a1\ub2f4\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574\uc11c\ub9cc \ud1b5\uc2e0\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc694\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 Yi\uc640 Vojnovic(2023)\uc758 \uc774\uc804 \ucd5c\uc0c1\uc758 \uacbd\uacc4\uc778 $\tilde{O}(\u03c1^{-1/3}(KT)^{2/3})$\ub97c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \uac1c\uc120\ud55c \uc0c1\ud55c\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc18c\ud1b5 \ube44\uc6a9\uacfc \ubc34\ub527 \ube44\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \ubb38\uc81c\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \ubd84\ud574\ud558\uc5ec, \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uacbd\uacc4\ub4e4\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 $R^d$\uc758 \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc120\ud615 \ubc34\ub527\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 $N$\uba85\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \ub85c\uceec \uc190\uc2e4\ub9cc \uad00\ucc30\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ud3c9\uade0 \uc190\uc2e4\uc744 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud611\ub825\ud558\ub294 \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ubc34\ub527\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\uc758 \ubbf8\ub2c8\ub9e5\uc2a4 \ud6c4\ud68c\uac00 $\tilde\u0398(\rho^{-1/2}+ K/N)T}$\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uc5ec\uae30\uc11c $T$\ub294 \uae30\uac04, $K$\ub294 \ud589\ub3d9\uc758 \uc218, $\u03c1$\ub294 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ud589\ub82c\uc758 \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc \uac2d\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc9c0\uc5f0 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \ubc34\ub527\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 \ucd95\uc18c \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc7a1\ub2f4\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574\uc11c\ub9cc \ud1b5\uc2e0\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc694\uad6c\ud558\uba70, \uc774\uc804\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801 \uacbd\uacc4\uc778 $\tilde{O}(\u03c1^{-1/3}(KT)^{2/3})$\ub97c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \uac1c\uc120\ud55c \uc0c1\ud55c\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ub9e4\uce6d \ud558\ud55c\uacfc \ubcf4\uc644\ud558\uc5ec \ubb38\uc81c\uc758 \ub09c\uc774\ub3c4\uac00 \uc18c\ud1b5 \ube44\uc6a9 $\u03c1^{-1/4}\text{sqrt{T}}$\uc640 \ubc34\ub527 \ube44\uc6a9 $\text{sqrt{KT/N}}$\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ub428\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c 1\ucc28 \ubc0f \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc138\uacc4\uc758 \ucd5c\uc0c1\uc758 \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uc5ec \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ub2e4\uc7ac\ub2e4\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c $R^d$\uc758 \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc120\ud615 \ubc34\ub527\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uc5ec, \uac01 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \uac01 \ub77c\uc6b4\ub4dc\ub2f9 $O(d)$\uc758 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c $\tilde{O}(\text{sqrt{(\u03c1^{-1/2}+1/N)dT}})$\uc758 \ud6c4\ud68c \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \uc5bb\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

To accelerate this progress, we introduce AIRS-Bench (the AI Research Science Benchmark), a suite of 20 tasks sourced from state-of-the-art machine learning papers. These tasks span diverse domains, including language modeling, mathematics, bioinformatics, and time series forecasting. AIRS-Bench tasks assess agentic capabilities over the full research lifecycle -- including idea generation, experiment analysis and iterative refinement -- without providing baseline code. The AIRS-Bench task format is versatile, enabling easy integration of new tasks and rigorous comparison across different agentic frameworks. We establish baselines using frontier models paired with both sequential and parallel scaffolds. Our results show that agents exceed human SOTA in four tasks but fail to match it in sixteen others. Even when agents surpass human benchmarks, they do not reach the theoretical performance ceiling for the underlying tasks. These findings indicate that AIRS-Bench is far from saturated and offers substantial room for improvement.

Most gradient-based parameter estimation methods rely on finite-difference approximations or automatic differentiation frameworks (e.g., JAX, PyTorch and TensorFlow), which are computationally demanding and introduce truncation errors, solver instabilities, and substantial overhead. These limitations are particularly acute for the ODE systems of conceptual watershed models. Here we introduce a fully analytic and computationally efficient framework for differentiable hydrologic modeling based on exact parameter sensitivities. By augmenting the governing ODE system with sensitivity equations, we jointly evolve the model states and the Jacobian matrix with respect to all parameters. This Jacobian then provides fully analytic gradient vectors for any differentiable loss function. These include classical objective functions such as the sum of absolute and squared residuals, widely used hydrologic performance metrics such as the Nash-Sutcliffe and Kling-Gupta efficiencies, robust loss functions that down-weight extreme events, and hydrograph-based functionals such as flow-duration and recession curves. The analytic sensitivities eliminate the step-size dependence and noise inherent to numerical differentiation, while avoiding the instability of adjoint methods and the overhead of modern machine-learning autodiff toolchains. The resulting gradients are deterministic, physically interpretable, and straightforward to embed in gradient-based optimizers. Overall, this work enables rapid, stable, and transparent gradient-based calibration of conceptual hydrologic models, unlocking the full potential of differentiable modeling without reliance on

We study agentic uncertainty by eliciting success probability estimates before, during, and after task execution. All results exhibit agentic overconfidence: some agents that succeed only 22% of the time predict 77% success. Counterintuitively, pre-execution assessment with strictly less information tends to yield better discrimination than standard post-execution review, though differences are not always significant.

Existing approaches predominantly operate within a static hypothesis space, which restricts the discovery of novel phenomena, resulting in computational waste when baseline theories fail. To address this, we propose shifting the focus from searching hypotheses to evolving the underlying scientific principles. We present PiEvo, a principle-evolvable framework that treats scientific discovery as Bayesian optimization over an expanding principle space. By integrating Information-Directed Hypothesis Selection via Gaussian Process and an anomaly-driven augmentation mechanism, PiEvo enables agents to autonomously refine their theoretical worldview. Evaluation across four benchmarks demonstrates that PiEvo (1) achieves an average solution quality of up to 90.81%~93.15%, representing a 29.7%~31.1% improvement over the state-of-the-art, (2) attains an 83.3% speedup in convergence step via significantly reduced sample complexity by optimizing the compact principle space, and (3) maintains robust performance across diverse scientific domains and

However, existing reward mechanisms remain tightly coupled to final correctness and pay little attention to the underlying reasoning process: trajectories with sound reasoning but wrong answers receive low credit, while lucky guesses with flawed logic may be highly rewarded, affecting reasoning generalization. From a causal perspective, we interpret multi-candidate reasoning for a fixed question as a family of counterfactual experiments with theoretical supports. Building on this, we propose Group Causal Counterfactual Policy Optimization to explicitly train LLMs to learn generalizable reasoning patterns. It proposes an episodic causal counterfactual reward that jointly captures (i) robustness, encouraging the answer distribution induced by a reasoning step to remain stable under counterfactual perturbations; and (ii) effectiveness, enforcing sufficient variability so that the learned reasoning strategy can transfer across questions. We then construct token-level advantages from this reward and optimize the policy, encouraging LLMs to favor reasoning patterns that are process-valid and counterfactually robust. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate its advantages.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc774 \uc774\uc720 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ub354 \uc798 \ubc18\uc601\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc740 \ucd5c\uc885 \uc815\ub2f5\uc5d0\ub9cc \uc8fc\ubaa9\ud558\uace0, \uadf8 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc774\uc720\uc131\uc744 \uac04\uacfc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Group Causal Counterfactual Policy Optimization\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec LLM\uc774 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc774\uc720 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc784\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc774\uc720 \ud328\ud134\uc758 \uacfc\uc815 \uc720\ud6a8\uc131\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud558\uace0, \uce74\uc6b4\ud130\ud329\ucd94\uc5bc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac15\uc778\ud55c LLM\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc798 \uc218\ud589\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc740 \ucd5c\uc885 \uc815\ub2f5\uc5d0 \ubc00\uc811\ud558\uac8c \uc5f0\uacb0\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc73c\uba70 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ucd94\ub860 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\ub294 \uac70\uc758 \uc8fc\ubaa9\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4: \ud0c0\ub2f9\ud55c \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud55c \uacbd\ub85c\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \ub2f5\ubcc0\uc740 \ub0ae\uc740 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \ubc1b\uace0, \ubd88\uc644\uc804\ud55c \ub17c\ub9ac\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \ud589\uc6b4\uc758 \ucd94\uce21\uc740 \ub192\uc740 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \ubc1b\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ucd94\ub860\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce69\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc778\uacfc\uc801 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uace0\uc815\ub41c \uc9c8\ubb38\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \ud6c4\ubcf4 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc9c0\uc6d0\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \ubc18\uc0ac\uc2e4\uc801 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc758 \ud55c \uc9d1\ud569\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uc11d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 LLM\uc774 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 Group Causal Counterfactual Policy Optimization\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 (i) \uac15\uac74\uc131, \uc989, \ubc18\uc0ac\uc2e4\uc801 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2e8\uacc4\uac00 \uc720\ub3c4\ud55c \ub2f5\ubcc0 \ubd84\ud3ec\uac00 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\uc9c0\ub418\ub3c4\ub85d \uc7a5\ub824\ud558\ub294 \ubcf4\uc0c1; (ii) \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131, \uc989, \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \ucd94\ub860 \uc804\ub7b5\uc774 \uc9c8\ubb38 \uac04\uc5d0 \uc804\uc774\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ucda9\ubd84\ud55c \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc81c\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uacf5\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\ud53c\uc18c\ub4dc \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc778\uacfc\uc801 \ubc18\uc0ac\uc2e4\uc801 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7f0 \ub2e4\uc74c \uc774 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ud1a0\ud070 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc774\uc810\uc744 \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uc5ec LLM\uc774 \uacfc\uc815\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\ud6a8\ud558\uace0 \ubc18\uc0ac\uc2e4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac15\uac74\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \uc6b0\uc120\uc2dc\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc7a5\ub824\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc740 \uadf8 \uc774\uc810\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Existing automatic MAS generation methods either rely on code generation, which often leads to executability and robustness failures, or impose rigid architectural templates that limit expressiveness and adaptability. We propose Evolutionary Generation of Multi-Agent Systems (EvoMAS), which formulates MAS generation as structured configuration generation. EvoMAS performs evolutionary generation in configuration space. Specifically, EvoMAS selects initial configurations from a pool, applies feedback-conditioned mutation and crossover guided by execution traces, and iteratively refines both the candidate pool and an experience memory. We evaluate EvoMAS on diverse benchmarks, including BBEH, SWE-Bench, and WorkBench, covering reasoning, software engineering, and tool-use tasks. EvoMAS consistently improves task performance over both human-designed MAS and prior automatic MAS generation methods, while producing generated systems with higher executability and runtime robustness. EvoMAS outperforms the agent evolution method EvoAgent by +10.5 points on BBEH reasoning and +7.1 points on WorkBench.

However, these architectures require substantial training time and are prone to overfitting on datasets with short sequences. In this paper, we explore a new paradigm for knowledge tracing by leveraging tabular foundation models (TFMs). Unlike traditional methods that require offline training on a fixed training set, our approach performs real-time ''live'' knowledge tracing in an online way. The core of our method lies in a two-way attention mechanism: while attention knowledge tracing models only attend across earlier time steps, TFMs simultaneously attend across both time steps and interactions of other students in the training set. They align testing sequences with relevant training sequences at inference time, therefore skipping the training step entirely. We demonstrate, using several datasets of increasing size, that our method achieves competitive predictive performance with up to 273x speedups, in a setting where more student interactions are observed over time.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc9c0\uc2dd \ucd94\uc801\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\uc5ec \ud0ed\ud615 \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378(TFM)\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub525 \uc9c0\uc2dd \ucd94\uc801 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud559\uc0dd \ud559\uc2b5 \uacbd\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc5d0\uc11c \ud070 \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \uc774\ub918\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ud6c8\ub828 \uc2dc\uac04\uacfc \uc9e7\uc740 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uacfc\uc801\ud569 \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \uc874\uc7ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc \ub2ec\ub9ac \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c0\uc2dd \ucd94\uc801\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc758 \uc8fc\uc758 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uba70, TFM\uc740 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc138\ud2b8\uc758 \ub2e4\ub978 \ud559\uc0dd \uac04 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uacfc \uc2dc\uac04 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub97c \ubaa8\ub450 \uace0\ub824\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc5ec\ub7ec \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc608\uce21 \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0\uc11c \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uba70, \ucd5c\ub300 273\ubc30\uc758 \uc18d\ub3c4 \uc99d\ub300\ub97c \uc774\ub8e8\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub354 \ub9ce\uc740 \ud559\uc0dd \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc774 \uad00\ucc30\ub418\ub294 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub525 \uc9c0\uc2dd \ucd94\uc801 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ud559\uc0dd \ud559\uc2b5 \uacbd\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ud601\uc2e0\uc744 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\ub294 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ud6c8\ub828 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\uba70 \uc9e7\uc740 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uacfc\uc801\ud569\ud558\uae30 \uc26c\uc6b4 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud14c\uc774\ube14\ud615 \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378(TFM)\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc9c0\uc2dd \ucd94\uc801\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uace0\uc815\ub41c \ud6c8\ub828 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc \ub2ec\ub9ac, \uc800\ud76c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 '\ub77c\uc774\ube0c' \uc9c0\uc2dd \ucd94\uc801\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc800\ud76c \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec\uc740 \uc591\ubc29\ud5a5 \uc8fc\uc758 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc5d0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc8fc\uc758 \uc9c0\uc2dd \ucd94\uc801 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc774\uc804 \uc2dc\uac04 \ub2e8\uacc4 \uac04\uc5d0\ub9cc \uc8fc\uc758\ub97c \uae30\uc6b8\uc774\ub294 \ubc18\uba74, TFM\uc740 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc138\ud2b8\uc758 \ub2e4\ub978 \ud559\uc0dd\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ubc0f \uc2dc\uac04 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uc8fc\uc758\ub97c \uae30\uc6b8\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub4e4\uc740 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\ub97c \uad00\ub828 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\uc5d0 \uc815\ub82c\ud558\uc5ec \ud6c8\ub828 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub97c \uc644\uc804\ud788 \uac74\ub108\ub701\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ud06c\uae30\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \uc800\ud76c \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc2dc\uac04\uc774 \uc9c0\ub0a8\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ub354 \ub9ce\uc740 \ud559\uc0dd \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc774 \uad00\ucc30\ub418\ub294 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ub300 273\ubc30\uc758 \uc18d\ub3c4 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uc774\ub8e8\uba74\uc11c \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uc608\uce21 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Existing analyses are often limited to finite-width statistics, lacking a rigorous characterisation of the global sparsity patterns that emerge as networks grow large. In this work, we connect discrete pruning heuristics to graph limit theory via graphons, establishing the graphon limit of PaI masks. We introduce a Factorised Saliency Model that encompasses popular pruning criteria and prove that, under regularity conditions, the discrete masks generated by these algorithms converge to deterministic bipartite graphons. This limit framework establishes a novel topological taxonomy for sparse networks: while unstructured methods (e.g., Random, Magnitude) converge to homogeneous graphons representing uniform connectivity, data-driven methods (e.g., SNIP, GraSP) converge to heterogeneous graphons that encode implicit feature selection. Leveraging this continuous characterisation, we derive two fundamental theoretical results: (i) a Universal Approximation Theorem for sparse networks that depends only on the intrinsic dimension of active coordinate subspaces; and (ii) a Graphon-NTK generalisation bound demonstrating how the limit graphon modulates the kernel geometry to align with informative features.

While most existing approaches, such as group convolutions and averaging-based methods, focus on compact, finite, or low-dimensional groups with linear actions, this work explores how equivariance can be extended to infinite-dimensional groups. We propose a strategy designed to induce diffeomorphism equivariance in pre-trained neural networks via energy-based canonicalisation. Formulating equivariance as an optimisation problem allows us to access the rich toolbox of already established differentiable image registration methods. Empirical results on segmentation and classification tasks confirm that our approach achieves approximate equivariance and generalises to unseen transformations without relying on extensive data augmentation or retraining.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ubb34\ud55c \ucc28\uc6d0 \uad70\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub3d9\ub4f1\uc131\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc5d0 \uad70 \ub300\uce6d\uc131\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ud604\ub300 \uc2ec\uce35 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c \ubd80\uac01\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uae30\ubc18 \uc815\uc900\ud654\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc5d0\uc11c \ubbf8\ubd84 \ub3d9\ud615\uc0ac\uc0c1 \ub3d9\ub4f1\uc131\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\ub294 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \ub3d9\ub4f1\uc131\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc218\uc2dd\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc138\uadf8\uba58\ud14c\uc774\uc158 \ubc0f \ubd84\ub958 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \uadfc\uc0ac \ub3d9\ub4f1\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc99d\ub300\ub098 \uc7ac\ud6c8\ub828 \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 \ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \ubcc0\ud658\uc5d0 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub428\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ubb34\ud55c \ucc28\uc6d0 \uad70\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc811\uadfc\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc758 \ub3d9\ub4f1\uc131\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud558\uace0, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubcc0\ud658\uc744 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uad70 \ub300\uce6d\uc131\uc744 \ub3d9\ub4f1\uc131\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ud604\ub300 \uc2ec\uce35 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc694\uad6c\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \ub5a0\uc62c\ub790\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub300\ub2e4\uc218 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd, \uc989 \uad70 \ud569\uc131\uacfc \ud3c9\uade0 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc120\ud615 \uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \ucf64\ud329\ud2b8, \uc720\ud55c \ub610\ub294 \uc800\ucc28\uc6d0 \uad70\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ub3d9\ub4f1\uc131\uc774 \ubb34\ud55c \ucc28\uc6d0 \uad70\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ud0d0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uae30\ubc18 \uc815\uc900\ud654\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc5d0\uc11c \ubbf8\ubd84 \ub3d9\ud615\uc0ac\uc0c1 \ub3d9\ub4f1\uc131\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\ub294 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub3d9\ub4f1\uc131\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc218\uc2dd\ud654\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc774\ubbf8 \ud655\ub9bd\ub41c \ubbf8\ubd84 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ub4f1\ub85d \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0c1\uc790\uc5d0 \uc811\uadfc\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ub41c\ub2e4. \uc138\uadf8\uba58\ud14c\uc774\uc158 \ubc0f \ubd84\ub958 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \uadfc\uc0ac \ub3d9\ub4f1\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc99d\ub300\ub098 \uc7ac\ud6c8\ub828\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0\ub3c4 \ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \ubcc0\ud658\uc5d0 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub428\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

In this work, we bridge this gap by analyzing the reverse process dynamics through the lens of thermodynamic entropy production. We propose the entropy production rate as a rigorous proxy for quantifying information generation, deriving as a byproduct a bound on the Wasserstein distance between intermediate states and the data distribution. Leveraging these insights, we introduce two novel sampling schedules that are uniformly spaced with respect to their corresponding physics-inspired metrics: the Entropic Discrete Schedule (EDS), which is defined by maintaining a constant rate of information gain, and the Wasserstein Discrete Schedule (WDS), which is defined by taking equal steps in terms of the Wasserstein distance. We empirically demonstrate that our proposed schedules significantly outperform state-of-the-art strategies across diverse application domains, including synthetic data, music notation, vision and language modeling, consistently achieving superior performance at a lower computational budget.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc774\uc0b0 \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758

This study introduces T-STAR (Two-stage Spatial and Temporal Adaptive contextual Representation), a novel transformer-based probabilistic framework designed to forecast station-level bike-sharing demand at a 15-minute resolution. T-STAR addresses key challenges in high-resolution forecasting by disentangling consistent demand patterns from short-term fluctuations through a hierarchical two-stage structure. The first stage captures coarse-grained hourly demand patterns, while the second stage improves prediction accuracy by incorporating high-frequency, localized inputs, including recent fluctuations and real-time demand variations in connected metro services, to account for temporal shifts in short-term demand. Time series transformer models are employed in both stages to generate probabilistic predictions. Extensive experiments using Washington D.C.'s Capital Bikeshare data demonstrate that T-STAR outperforms existing methods in both deterministic and probabilistic accuracy. The model exhibits strong spatial and temporal robustness across stations and time periods. A zero-shot forecasting experiment further highlights T-STAR's ability to transfer to previously unseen service areas without retraining.

Traditionally, therapeutic TMS has been applied in a one-size-fits-all approach, disregarding inter- and intra-individual differences. Brain state-dependent EEG-TMS, such as coupling TMS with a pre-specified phase of the sensorimotor mu-rhythm, enables the induction of differential neuroplastic effects depending on the targeted phase. But this approach is still user-dependent as it requires defining an a-priori target phase. Objectives: To present a first realization of a machine-learning-based, closed-loop real-time EEG-TMS setup to identify user-independently the individual mu-rhythm phase associated with high- vs. low-corticospinal excitability states. Methods: We applied EEG-TMS to 25 participants targeting the supplementary motor area-primary motor cortex network and used a reinforcement learning algorithm to identify the mu-rhythm phase associated with high- vs. low corticospinal excitability. We employed linear mixed effects models and Bayesian analysis to determine effects of reinforced learning on corticospinal excitability indexed by motor evoked potential amplitude, and functional connectivity indexed by the imaginary part of resting-state EEG coherence. Results: Reinforcement learning effectively identified the mu-rhythm phase associated with high- vs. low-excitability states, and their repetitive stimulation resulted in long-term increases vs. decreases in functional connectivity in the stimulated sensorimotor network. Conclusions: We demonstrated for the first time the feasibility of closed-loop EEG-TMS in humans, a critical step towards individualized treatment of brain disorders.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8

True intelligence relies on \"world models\" -- causal abstractions that allow an agent to not only predict future states but understand the underlying governing dynamics. While previous \"AI Physicist\" approaches have successfully recovered such laws, they typically rely on strong, domain-specific priors that effectively \"bake in\" the physics. Conversely, Vafa et al. recently showed that generic Transformers fail to acquire these world models, achieving high predictive accuracy without capturing the underlying physical laws. We bridge this gap by systematically introducing three minimal inductive biases. We show that ensuring spatial smoothness (by formulating prediction as continuous regression) and stability (by training with noisy contexts to mitigate error accumulation) enables generic Transformers to surpass prior failures and learn a coherent Keplerian world model, successfully fitting ellipses to planetary trajectories. However, true physical insight requires a third bias: temporal locality. By restricting the attention window to the immediate past -- imposing the simple assumption that future states depend only on the local state rather than a complex history -- we force the model to abandon curve-fitting and discover Newtonian force representations. Our results demonstrate that simple architectural choices determine whether an AI becomes a curve-fitter or a physicist, marking a critical step toward automated scientific discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc77c\ubc18 \ubaa9\uc801 AI \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uac00 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \ub118\uc5b4 \uc6b0\uc8fc\uc758 \ubb3c\ub9ac \ubc95\uce59\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc744\uae4c?", "motivation": "\uc9c4\uc815\ud55c \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ubbf8\ub798 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \uc608\uce21\ud560 \ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uc9c0\ubc30 \uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uc778\uacfc \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654\uc778 '\uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378'\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud55c\uc758 \uc720\ub3c4 \ubc14\uc774\uc5b4\uc2a4\ub97c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uacf5\uac04\uc801 \ub9e4\ub044\ub7ec\uc6c0\uacfc \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801 \ud2b8\ub79c\uc2a4\ud3ec\uba38\uac00 \uc2e4\ud328\ub97c \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\uace0 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \ucf00\ud50c\ub7ec \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc77c\ubc18\uc801 \ud2b8\ub79c\uc2a4\ud3ec\uba38\uac00 \ud589\uc131 \uada4\ub3c4\uc5d0 \ud0c0\uc6d0\uc744 \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub9de\ucd94\ub294 \ub370 \uc131\uacf5\ud588\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \uc120\ud0dd\uc774 AI\uac00 \uace1\uc120 \uc801\ud569\uae30\uc778\uc9c0 \ubb3c\ub9ac\ud559\uc790\uc778\uc9c0\ub97c \uacb0\uc815\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \ud5a5\ud55c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub2e8\uacc4\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc77c\ubc18 \ubaa9\uc801 AI \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uac00 \uc6b0\uc8fc\ub97c \uc9c0\ubc30\ud558\ub294 \ubb3c\ub9ac \ubc95\uce59\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc744\uae4c? \uc9c4\uc815\ud55c \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ubbf8\ub798 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \uc608\uce21\ud560 \ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uc9c0\ubc30 \uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud558\ub294 '\uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378'\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\uc804\uc758 'AI \ubb3c\ub9ac\ud559\uc790' \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc95\uce59\uc744 \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud68c\ubcf5\ud588\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubb3c\ub9ac\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c '\ub0b4\uc7a5'\ud558\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud558\uace0 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\ud654\ub41c \uc120\ud5d8\uc801 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubc18\ub300\ub85c, Vafa et al.\uc740 \ucd5c\uadfc \uc77c\ubc18\uc801 \ud2b8\ub79c\uc2a4\ud3ec\uba38\uac00 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ucde8\ub4dd\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc2e4\ud328\ud558\uba70, \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ubb3c\ub9ac \ubc95\uce59\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \ub192\uc740 \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uacf5\uac04\uc801 \ub9e4\ub044\ub7ec\uc6c0(\uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc5f0\uc18d \ud68c\uadc0\ub85c \ud615\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uc5ec)\uacfc \uc548\uc815\uc131(\uc624\ub958 \ucd95\uc801\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc7a1\uc74c \uc788\ub294 \ubb38\ub9e5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\uc5ec)\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uac04\uadf9\uc744 \uba54\uc6b4\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc9c4\uc815\ud55c \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uc138 \ubc88\uc9f8 \ubc14\uc774\uc5b4\uc2a4\uc778 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \uad6d\uc18c\uc131\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \uc989, \uc8fc\uc758 \ucc3d\uc744 \uc9c1\uc804\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\ud55c\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ubbf8\ub798 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uac00 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc5ed\uc0ac\ubcf4\ub2e4\ub294 \ub85c\uceec \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0\ub9cc \uc758\uc874\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \uac00\uc815\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uace1\uc120 \uc801\ud569\uc744 \ud3ec\uae30\ud558\uace0 \ub274\ud134\uc801 \ud798 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uac15\uc694\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \uc120\ud0dd\uc774 AI\uac00 \uace1\uc120 \uc801\ud569\uae30\uc778\uc9c0 \ubb3c\ub9ac\ud559\uc790\uc778\uc9c0\ub97c \uacb0\uc815\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \ud5a5\ud55c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub2e8\uacc4\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4."}}

We consider model-free algorithms with function approximation that learn value and advantage functions directly from data, without unrealistic structural assumptions on the dynamics.\n  Leveraging the ellipticity of the diffusions, we establish a new class of Hilbert-space positive definiteness and boundedness properties for the Bellman operators. Based on these properties, we propose the Sobolev-prox fitted $q$-learning algorithm, which learns value and advantage functions by iteratively solving least-squares regression problems. We derive oracle inequalities for the estimation error, governed by (i) the best approximation error of the function classes, (ii) their localized complexity, (iii) exponentially decaying optimization error, and (iv) numerical discretization error.
