In contrast, Distributional Reinforcement Learning (DRL)\nestimates the entire probability distribution of possible rewards, providing\nricher information about uncertainty and variability. C51 is a popular DRL\nalgorithm for discrete action spaces. It uses a Q-learning approach, where the\ndistribution is learned using a greedy Bellman update. However, this can cause\nproblems if multiple actions at a state have similar expected reward but with\ndifferent distributions, as the algorithm may not learn a stable distribution.\nThis study presents a modified version of C51 (ES-C51) that replaces the greedy\nQ-learning update with an Expected Sarsa update, which uses a softmax\ncalculation to combine information from all possible actions at a state rather\nthan relying on a single best action. This reduces instability when actions\nhave similar expected rewards and allows the agent to learn higher-performing\npolicies. This approach is evaluated on classic control environments from Gym,\nand Atari-10 games.

In this\nwork, we introduce a novel approach that leverages automaton-based feedback to\nguide the learning process, replacing explicit reward functions with\npreferences derived from a deterministic finite automaton (DFA). Unlike\nconventional approaches that use automata for direct reward specification, our\nmethod employs the structure of the DFA to generate preferences over\ntrajectories that are used to learn a reward function, eliminating the need for\nmanual reward engineering. Our framework introduces a static approach that uses\nthe learned reward function directly for policy optimization and a dynamic\napproach that involves continuous refining of the reward function and policy\nthrough iterative updates until convergence.\n  Our experiments in both discrete and continuous environments demonstrate that\nour approach enables the RL agent to learn effective policies for tasks with\ntemporal dependencies, outperforming traditional reward engineering and\nautomaton-based baselines such as reward machines and LTL-guided methods. Our\nresults highlight the advantages of automaton-based preferences in handling\nnon-Markovian rewards, offering a scalable, efficient, and human-independent\nalternative to traditional reward modeling. We also provide a convergence\nguarantee showing that under standard assumptions our automaton-guided\npreference-based framework learns a policy that is near-optimal with respect to\nthe true non-Markovian objective."}
