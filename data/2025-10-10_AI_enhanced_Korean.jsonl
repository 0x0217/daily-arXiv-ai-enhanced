We present R3R, to our knowledge the first decentralized and\nasynchronous framework for multi-agent motion planning under distance-based\ncommunication constraints with infinite-horizon safety guarantees for systems\nof nonlinear agents. R3R's novelty lies in combining our gatekeeper safety\nframework with a geometric constraint called R-Boundedness, which together\nestablish a formal link between an agent's communication radius and its ability\nto plan safely. We constrain trajectories to within a fixed planning radius\nthat is a function of the agent's communication radius, which enables\ntrajectories to be shown provably safe for all time, using only local\ninformation. Our algorithm is fully asynchronous, and ensures the forward\ninvariance of these guarantees even in time-varying networks where agents\nasynchronously join, leave, and replan. We validate our approach in simulations\nof up to 128 Dubins vehicles, demonstrating 100% safety in dense, obstacle rich\nscenarios. Our results demonstrate that R3R's performance scales with agent\ndensity rather than problem size, providing a practical solution for scalable\nand provably safe multi-agent systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "R3R\uc740 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc81c\uc57d \ud558\uc5d0 \ubb34\ud55c \ud638\ub9ac\uc874 \uc548\uc804 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\ub294 \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \ube44\ub300\uce6d \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc6b4\ub3d9 \uacc4\ud68d \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubd84\uc0b0 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc6b4\ub3d9 \uacc4\ud68d \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ud615\uc2dd\uc801\uc778 \ubb34\ud55c \ud638\ub9ac\uc874 \uc548\uc804 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "R3R\ub294 \uac8c\uc774\ud2b8\ud0a4\ud37c \uc548\uc804 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc640 R-\uad6c\uc18d\uc131\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \uc81c\uc57d \uc870\uac74\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ubc18\uacbd\uacfc \uc548\uc804\ud558\uac8c \uacc4\ud68d\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825 \uac04\uc758 \ud615\uc2dd\uc801\uc778 \uc5f0\uad00\uc131\uc744 established\ub294\ub2e4.", "result": "128\ub300\uc758 \ub450\ube48\uc2a4 \ucc28\ub7c9\uc744 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, \uc870\ubc00\ud558\uace0 \uc7a5\uc560\ubb3c\uc774 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c 100%\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "R3R\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubc00\ub3c4\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ud655\uc7a5\ub418\uba70, \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uc99d\uba85\ub41c \uc548\uc804\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubd84\uc0b0 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc6b4\ub3d9 \uacc4\ud68d \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ud615\uc2dd\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ubb34\ud55c \ud638\ub9ac\uc874 \uc548\uc804 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uacb0\uc5ec\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ud2b9\ud788 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc81c\uc57d\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0 \ub354\uc6b1 \uadf8\ub807\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ube44\ub300\uce6d \ube44\uc120\ud615 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uac70\ub9ac \uae30\ubc18 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ucda9\uc871\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc6b4\ub3d9 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \ube44\ub300\uce6d \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 R3R\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Nevertheless, many application areas that matter for\ndaily life and society show only modest gains so far; a prominent case is\ndiagnosing and treating dynamically evolving disease in intensive care.\n  The common challenge is adapting complex systems to dynamic environments.\nEffective strategies must optimize outcomes in systems composed of strongly\ninteracting functions while avoiding shared side effects; this requires\nreliable, self-adaptive modeling. These tasks align with building digital twins\nof highly complex systems whose mechanisms are not fully or quantitatively\nunderstood. It is therefore essential to develop methods for self-adapting AI\nmodels with minimal data and limited mechanistic knowledge. As this challenge\nextends beyond medicine, AI should demonstrate clear superiority in these\nsettings before assuming broader decision-making roles.\n  We identify the curse of dimensionality as a fundamental barrier to efficient\nself-adaptation and argue that monolithic foundation models face conceptual\nlimits in overcoming it. As an alternative, we propose a decentralized\narchitecture of interacting small agent networks (SANs).

However, stateless inference often struggles on\nmulti-step tasks due to the absence of persistent state. Moreover,\ntask-specific fine-tuning or instruction-tuning often achieve surface-level\ncode generation but remain brittle on tasks requiring deeper reasoning and\nlong-horizon dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose stateful\nmulti-agent evolutionary search, a training-free framework that departs from\nprior stateless approaches by combining (i) persistent inference-time state,\n(ii) adversarial mutation, and (iii) evolutionary preservation. We demonstrate\nits effectiveness in automated unit test generation through the generation of\nedge cases. We generate robust edge cases using an evolutionary search process,\nwhere specialized agents sequentially propose, mutate, and score candidates. A\ncontroller maintains persistent state across generations, while evolutionary\npreservation ensures diversity and exploration across all possible cases. This\nyields a generalist agent capable of discovering robust, high-coverage edge\ncases across unseen codebases. Experiments show our stateful multi-agent\ninference framework achieves substantial gains in coverage over stateless\nsingle-step baselines, evaluated on prevalent unit-testing benchmarks such as\nHumanEval and TestGenEvalMini and using three diverse LLM families - Llama,\nGemma, and GPT. These results indicate that combining persistent inference-time\nstate with evolutionary search materially improves unit-test generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc0c1\ud0dc \uc720\uc9c0 \ub2e4\uc911

Current multi-objective multi-agent path finding\n(MO-MAPF) algorithms typically produce conflict-free plans by computing Pareto\nfrontiers. They do not explicitly optimize for user-defined preferences, even\nwhen the preferences are available, and scale poorly with the number of\nobjectives. We propose a lexicographic framework for modeling MO-MAPF, along\nwith an algorithm \\textit{Lexicographic Conflict-Based Search} (LCBS) that\ndirectly computes a single solution aligned with a lexicographic preference\nover objectives. LCBS integrates a priority-aware low-level $A^*$ search with\nconflict-based search, avoiding Pareto frontier construction and enabling\nefficient planning guided by preference over objectives. We provide insights\ninto optimality and scalability, and empirically demonstrate that LCBS computes\noptimal solutions while scaling to instances with up to ten objectives -- far\nbeyond the limits of existing MO-MAPF methods.

However, prevailing methods\nrely on hand-crafted or pre-specified strategies and struggle to balance\nefficiency, imperceptibility, and security, particularly at high embedding\nrates. Accordingly, we propose Auto-Stega, an agent-driven self-evolving\nframework that is the first to realize self-evolving steganographic strategies\nby automatically discovering, composing, and adapting strategies at inference\ntime; the framework operates as a closed loop of generating, evaluating,\nsummarizing, and updating that continually curates a structured strategy\nlibrary and adapts across corpora, styles, and task constraints. A decoding LLM\nrecovers the information under the shared strategy. To handle high embedding\nrates, we introduce PC-DNTE, a plug-and-play algorithm that maintains alignment\nwith the base model's conditional distribution at high embedding rates,\npreserving imperceptibility while enhancing security.

To address this limitation, we\npropose two methods for generating complex-valued representations from\nreal-valued datasets: a natural transformation and an autoencoder-driven\nmethod. Building on these mechanisms, we propose RVFL-X, a complex-valued\nextension of the random vector functional link (RVFL) network. RVFL-X\nintegrates complex transformations into real-valued datasets while maintaining\nthe simplicity and efficiency of the original RVFL architecture. By leveraging\ncomplex components such as input, weights, and activation functions, RVFL-X\nprocesses complex representations and produces real-valued outputs.\nComprehensive evaluations on 80 real-valued UCI datasets demonstrate that\nRVFL-X consistently outperforms both the original RVFL and state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) RNN variants, showcasing its robustness and effectiveness across diverse\napplication domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "RVFL-X\ub294 \ubcf5\uc18c\uc218 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc751\uc6a9 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \uad6c\uc870\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ucd5c\uadfc \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \ubcf5\uc18c\uc218\uc758 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \ud45c\ud604\ub825\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\uc744 \ub450\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\ub098, \uc2e4\uc218 \uae30\ubc18 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \ubcf5\uc18c\uc218\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub294 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uc5ec \ubb34\uc791\uc704 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucc44\ud0dd\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc2e4\uc218 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf5\uc18c\uc218 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc790\uc5f0 \ubcc0\ud658\uacfc \uc624\ud1a0\uc778\ucf54\ub354 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\ubc95 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

As CUAs in\nthe OS domain become increasingly embedded in daily operations, it is\nimperative to examine their real-world security implications, specifically\nwhether CUAs can be misused to perform realistic, security-relevant attacks.\nExisting works exhibit four major limitations: Missing attacker-knowledge model\non tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP), Incomplete coverage for\nend-to-end kill chains, unrealistic environment without multi-host and\nencrypted user credentials, and unreliable judgment dependent on\nLLM-as-a-Judge. To address these gaps, we propose AdvCUA, the first benchmark\naligned with real-world TTPs in MITRE ATT&CK Enterprise Matrix, which comprises\n140 tasks, including 40 direct malicious tasks, 74 TTP-based malicious tasks,\nand 26 end-to-end kill chains, systematically evaluates CUAs under a realistic\nenterprise OS security threat in a multi-host environment sandbox by hard-coded\nevaluation. We evaluate the existing five mainstream CUAs, including ReAct,\nAutoGPT, Gemini CLI, Cursor CLI, and Cursor IDE based on 8 foundation LLMs. The\nresults demonstrate that current frontier CUAs do not adequately cover OS\nsecurity-centric threats.

To solve novel problems, agents should acquire skills for\nexploring and learning through experience. Finding a scalable learning\nmechanism for developing agents that learn through interaction remains a major\nopen problem. In this work, we introduce BuilderBench, a benchmark to\naccelerate research into agent pre-training that centers open-ended\nexploration. BuilderBench requires agents to learn how to build any structure\nusing blocks. BuilderBench is equipped with $(1)$ a hardware accelerated\nsimulator of a robotic agent interacting with various physical blocks, and\n$(2)$ a task-suite with over 42 diverse target structures that are carefully\ncurated to test an understanding of physics, mathematics, and long-horizon\nplanning. During training, agents have to explore and learn general principles\nabout the environment without any external supervision. During evaluation,\nagents have to build the unseen target structures from the task suite. Solving\nthese tasks requires a sort of \\emph{embodied reasoning} that is not reflected\nin words but rather in actions, experimenting with different strategies and\npiecing them together. Our experiments show that many of these tasks challenge\nthe current iteration of algorithms. Hence, we also provide a ``training\nwheels'' protocol, in which agents are trained and evaluated to build a single\ntarget structure from the task suite. Finally, we provide single-file\nimplementations of six different algorithms as a reference point for\nresearchers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc624\ud508 \uc5d4\ub514\ub4dc \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc778 BuilderBench\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud604\uc7ac AI \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uae30\uc874 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ubc0f \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\uc220\uc744 \uc2b5\ub4dd\ud574\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "BuilderBench\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubb3c\ub9ac \ube14\ub85d\uacfc \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub85c\ubd07 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uac00\uc18d \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\ud130\uc640 \ubb3c\ub9ac\ud559, \uc218\ud559, \uc7a5\uae30 \uacc4\ud68d\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc774\ud574\ub97c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc2e0\uc911\ud558\uac8c \uc120\ubcc4\ub41c 42\uac1c \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubaa9\ud45c \uad6c\uc870\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \uc791\uc5c5 \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud6c8\ub828 \ub3d9\uc548 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc678\ubd80 \uac10\ub3c5 \uc5c6\uc774 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18 \uc6d0\uce59\uc744 \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\uace0 \ud559\uc2b5\ud574\uc57c \ud558\uba70, \ud3c9\uac00 \uc911\uc5d0\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \ubaa9\ud45c \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud574\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9ce\uc740 \uc791\uc5c5\uc774 \ud604\uc7ac \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc744 \ub3c4\uc804\ud558\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4ed\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e8\uc77c \ubaa9\ud45c \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uad50\uc721\ud558\uace0 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 '\ud6c8\ub828 \ubc14\ud034' \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uc5f0\uad6c\uc790\ub4e4\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc5ec\uc12f \uac00\uc9c0 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \ub2e8\uc77c \ud30c\uc77c \uad6c\ud604\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc624\ub298\ub0a0 AI \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc8fc\ub85c \ubaa8\ubc29\uacfc \ub2e4\ub4ec\uae30\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ubbc0\ub85c \uae30\uc874 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \uc124\uc815\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ub118\uc5b4\uc11c\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ub180\ub78d\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\uace0 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \uae30\uc220\uc744 \uc2b5\ub4dd\ud574\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud559\uc2b5 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ucc3e\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc8fc\uc694 \ub09c\uc81c\ub85c \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uac1c\ubc29\ud615 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc778 BuilderBench\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

It is motivated by the\nLast Revealer Attack (LRA), which undermines fairness in some Proof-of-Stake\n(PoS) blockchains such as Ethereum (\\$400B market capitalization). We introduce\npseudo-MDPs (pMDPs) a framework that naturally models such problems and propose\ntwo distinct problem reductions to standard MDPs. One problem reduction\nprovides a novel, counter-intuitive perspective, and combining the two problem\nreductions enables significant improvements in dynamic programming algorithms\nsuch as value iteration. In the case of the LRA which size is parameterized by\n$\\kappa$ (in Ethereum's case $\\kappa$= 325), we reduce the computational\ncomplexity from $O(2^\\kappa \\kappa^{2^{\\kappa+2}})$ to $O(\\kappa^4)$ (per\niteration). This solution also provide the usual benefits from Dynamic\nProgramming solutions: exponentially fast convergence toward the optimal\nsolution is guaranteed. The dual perspective also simplifies policy extraction,\nmaking the approach well-suited for resource-constrained agents who can operate\nwith very limited memory and computation once the problem has been solved.\nFurthermore, we generalize those results to a broader class of MDPs, enhancing\ntheir applicability.

Pretrained on RelBench datasets spanning\ntasks such as churn and sales forecasting, RT attains strong zero-shot\nperformance, averaging 94% of fully supervised AUROC on binary classification\ntasks with a single forward pass of a 22M parameter model, as opposed to 84%\nfor a 27B LLM.

Although the\ntheoretical and practical guidance exists for post-merger integration on the\nbusiness level, there is a significant gap in training for information system\nintegration in this context. In prior research specific methods AMILI (Support\nmethod for informed decision identification) and AMILP (Support method for\ninformed decision-making) were introduced for the support of information system\nintegration decisions in the post-merger integration. But during the practical\napplication was reported high learning curve and low learner motivation. This\npaper explores how game-based learning design can address these limitations by\ntransforming static method training into engaging learning experience. The\nstudy analyzes foundational learning theories, cognitive load and motivation\nmodels, and serious game design frameworks to identify the essential\nrequirements for a game-based learning design framework tailored to information\nsystem integration in post-merger integration. Requirements are structured in\ntwo components: the transformation process and resulting learning experience.\nThe paper concludes with a plan for developing and evaluating the proposed\nframework through iterative design and real-world validation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ud569\ubcd1 \ud6c4 \ud1b5\ud569\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ubcf4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ud1b5\ud569\uc758 \ub3c4\uc804\uacfc\uc81c \ud574\uacb0\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uac8c\uc784 \uae30\ubc18 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc124\uacc4\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8ec \ub17c\ubb38.", "motivation": "\ud569\ubcd1 \ud6c4 \ud1b5\ud569\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ubcf4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ud1b5\ud569\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uad50\uc721\uc758 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uc18c\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud568.", "method": "\uac8c\uc784 \uae30\ubc18 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc815\uc801 \uad50\uc721 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ub9e4\ub825\uc801\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c.", "result": "\uae30\ucd08 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc774\ub860, \uc778\uc9c0 \ubd80\ud558 \ubc0f \ub3d9\uae30 \ubaa8\ub378, \uc9c4\uc9c0\ud55c \uac8c\uc784 \uc124\uacc4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\ubcf4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ud1b5\ud569\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uac8c\uc784 \uae30\ubc18 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc124\uacc4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \ud544\uc218 \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud568.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ubc18\ubcf5 \uc124\uacc4 \ubc0f \uc2e4\uc81c \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uace0 \ud3c9\uac00\ud560 \uacc4\ud68d\uc73c\ub85c \uacb0\ub860\uc744 \ub0b4\ub9bc.", "translated_summary": "\ud569\ubcd1 \ud6c4 \ud1b5\ud569\uc740 \ud1b5\ud569\ub41c \uc870\uc9c1\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uc870\ud654\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd98 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ud1b5\ud569\uc744 \ub2f4\ub2f9\ud558\ub294 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc5d0\uac8c \uace0\uc720\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ube44\uc988\ub2c8\uc2a4 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc5d0\uc11c \ud569\ubcd1 \ud6c4 \ud1b5\ud569\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ubc0f \uc2e4\uc81c\uc801 \uc9c0\uce68\uc740 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ubcf4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ud1b5\ud569\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uad50\uc721\uc740 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uaca9\ucc28\uac00 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uc804 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud569\ubcd1 \ud6c4 \ud1b5\ud569\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ubcf4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ud1b5\ud569 \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 AMILI(\uc815\ubcf4 \uae30\ubc18 \uacb0\uc815 \uc2dd\ubcc4 \uc9c0\uc6d0 \ubc29\ubc95)\uc640 AMILP(\uc815\ubcf4 \uae30\ubc18 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uc9c0\uc6d0 \ubc29\ubc95)\ub77c\ub294 \ud2b9\uc815 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ub3c4\uc785\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc801\uc6a9 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ub192\uc740 \ud559\uc2b5 \uace1\uc120\uacfc \ub0ae\uc740 \ud559\uc2b5\uc790 \ub3d9\uae30\uac00 \ubcf4\uace0\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uac8c\uc784 \uae30\ubc18 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc124\uacc4\uac00 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\uba70, \uc815\uc801 \ubc29\ubc95 \uad50\uc721\uc744 \ub9e4\ub825\uc801\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\ud658\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ud1b5\ud569\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uac8c\uc784 \uae30\ubc18 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc124\uacc4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uae30\ubcf8 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc774\ub860, \uc778\uc9c0 \ubd80\ud558 \ubc0f \ub3d9\uae30 \ubaa8\ub378, \uc9c4\uc9c0\ud55c \uac8c\uc784 \uc124\uacc4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc5ec \ud544\uc218 \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc740 \uc804\ud658 \uacfc\uc815\uacfc \uacb0\uacfc\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc694\uc18c\ub85c \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ubc18\ubcf5 \uc124\uacc4 \ubc0f \uc2e4\uc81c \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uace0 \ud3c9\uac00\ud560 \uacc4\ud68d\uc73c\ub85c \ub9c8\ubb34\ub9ac\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

We show that this geometry creates a\nboundary-driven asymmetry that backdoor triggers can exploit. Near the\nboundary, small input changes appear subtle to standard input-space detectors\nbut produce disproportionately large shifts in the model's representation\nspace. Our analysis formalizes this effect and also reveals a limitation for\ndefenses: methods that act by pulling points inward along the radius can\nsuppress such triggers, but only by sacrificing useful model sensitivity in\nthat same direction. Building on these insights, we propose a simple\ngeometry-adaptive trigger and evaluate it across tasks and architectures.\nEmpirically, attack success increases toward the boundary, whereas conventional\ndetectors weaken, mirroring the theoretical trends. Together, these results\nsurface a geometry-specific vulnerability in non-Euclidean models and offer\nanalysis-backed guidance for designing and understanding the limits of\ndefenses.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ube44\uc720\ud074\ub9ac\ub4dc \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \uacbd\uacc4 \uadfc\ucc98\uc758 \uc785\ub825 \ubcc0\ud654\uac00 \ube44\ub300\uce6d\uc131\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub294 \ubc31\ub3c4\uc5b4 \ud2b8\ub9ac\uac70\uc758 \uc131\uacf5\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4\ub294 \uc5f0\uad6c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ube44\uc720\ud074\ub9ac\ub4dc \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \ud2b9\uc131\uc774 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0bc \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud568\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud45c\ud604 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ube44\ub300\uce6d\uc131\uacfc \ubc31\ub3c4\uc5b4 \ud2b8\ub9ac\uac70\uc758 \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc801\uc751\ud558\ub294 \ud2b8\ub9ac\uac70\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uacf5\uaca9\uc758 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc740 \uacbd\uacc4\uc5d0 \uac00\uae4c\uc6b8\uc218\ub85d \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uba70, \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uae30\uac00 \uc57d\ud574\uc9c0\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ube44\uc720\ud074\ub9ac\ub4dc \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b4\uace0, \ubc29\uc5b4 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998 \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ubd84\uc11d \uae30\ubc18 \uc9c0\uce68\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ube44\uc720\ud074\ub9ac\ub4dc \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uace1\uba74 \uacf5\uac04, \ud2b9\ud788 \ud5e4\ud37c\ubcfc\ub9ad \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc5d0 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ubc30\uce58\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc774 \uacbd\uacc4 \uc8fc\ub3c4 \ube44\ub300\uce6d\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uc774\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ubc31\ub3c4\uc5b4 \ud2b8\ub9ac\uac70\uac00 \uc774\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacbd\uacc4 \uadfc\ucc98\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\uc740 \uc785\ub825 \ubcc0\ud654\ub294 \ud45c\uc900 \uc785\ub825 \uacf5\uac04 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uae30\uc5d0\ub294 \ubbf8\uc138\ud558\uac8c \ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud45c\ud604 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubd88\uade0\ud615\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud070 \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \uc720\ubc1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubd84\uc11d\uc740 \uc774 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \ud615\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uace0 \ubc29\uc5b4\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4: \ubc18\uacbd\uc744 \ub530\ub77c \uc810\uc744 \ub0b4\ubd80\ub85c \ub04c\uc5b4\ub2f9\uae30\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud2b8\ub9ac\uac70\ub97c \uc5b5\uc81c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uac19\uc740 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378 \ubbfc\uac10\uc131\uc744 \ud76c\uc0dd\ud574\uc57c\ub9cc \uac00\ub2a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \uae30\ud558\ud559 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ud2b8\ub9ac\uac70\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \uc791\uc5c5 \ubc0f \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc774\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uacf5\uaca9\uc758 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc740 \uacbd\uacc4\ub85c \uac08\uc218\ub85d \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0, \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uae30\ub294 \uc57d\ud654\ub418\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uacbd\ud5a5\uacfc \uc77c\uce58\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uacb0\uacfc\ub4e4\uc740 \ube44\uc720\ud074\ub9ac\ub4dc \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \ud2b9\uc720\uc758 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b4\uace0 \ubc29\uc5b4\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0 \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubd84\uc11d \uae30\ubc18 \uc9c0\uce68\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, existing\nconsensus-seeking approaches typically rely on voting mechanisms to judge\nconsensus, overlooking contradictions in system-internal beliefs that\ndestabilize the consensus. Moreover, these methods often involve agents\nupdating their results through indiscriminate collaboration with every other\nagent. Such uniform interaction fails to identify the optimal collaborators for\neach agent, hindering the emergence of a stable consensus. To address these\nchallenges, we provide a theoretical framework for selecting optimal\ncollaborators that maximize consensus stability. Based on the theorems, we\npropose the Belief-Calibrated Consensus Seeking (BCCS) framework to facilitate\nstable consensus via selecting optimal collaborators and calibrating the\nconsensus judgment by system-internal beliefs. Experimental results on the MATH\nand MMLU benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed BCCS framework\noutperforms the best existing results by 2.23% and 3.95% of accuracy on\nchallenging tasks, respectively.

The investigation reveals a\npronounced architecture dependent security-robustness trade-off: pixel-space\nmodels achieve high security against steganalysis but exhibit fragility to\nchannel distortions, while VAE-based systems like Stable Diffusion offer\nsubstantial robustness at the cost of security vulnerabilities. Further\nanalysis indicates that the VAE component drives this behavior through opposing\nmechanisms where the encoder confers robustness via manifold regularization\nwhile the decoder introduces vulnerabilities by amplifying latent perturbations\ninto detectable artifacts.

While many studies have demonstrated\nperformance benefits of combining multiple model predictions, existing\nstrategies using linear pooling methods (ranging from simple averaging to\ndynamic weight updates) face a key limitation. Dynamic prediction combinations\nthat rely on historical performance to update weights are necessarily reactive.\nDue to the need to average over a reasonable number of epochs (with moving\naverages or exponential weighting), they tend to be slow to adjust to changing\ncircumstances (phase or regime changes). In this work, we develop a model that\nuses machine learning to forecast the performance of predictions by models at\neach epoch in a time series. This enables `context-awareness' by assigning\nhigher weight to models that are likely to be more accurate at a given time. We\nshow that adding a performance forecasting worker in a decentralized learning\nnetwork, following a design similar to the Allora network, can improve the\naccuracy of network inferences. Specifically, we find forecasting models that\npredict regret (performance relative to the network inference) or regret\nz-score (performance relative to other workers) show greater improvement than\nmodels predicting losses, which often do not outperform the naive network\ninference (historically weighted average of all inferences).

This transparency also opens a promising\ndirection: multiple reasoners can directly collaborate on each other's thinking\nwithin a shared trajectory, yielding better inference efficiency and\nexploration. A key prerequisite, however, is the ability to assess the\nusefulness and build on another model's partial thinking -- we call this\noff-trajectory reasoning. Our paper investigates a critical question: can\nstandard solo-reasoning training pipelines deliver desired off-trajectory\nbehaviors? We propose twin tests that capture the two extremes of the\noff-trajectory spectrum, namely Recoverability, which tests whether LLMs can\nbacktrack from \"distractions\" induced by misleading reasoning traces, and\nGuidability, which tests their ability to build upon correct reasoning from\nstronger collaborators. Our study evaluates 15 open-weight LLMs (1.5B-32B) and\nreveals a counterintuitive finding -- \"stronger\" LLMs on benchmarks are often\nmore fragile under distraction. Moreover, all models tested fail to effectively\nleverage guiding steps from collaborators on problems beyond their inherent\ncapabilities with solve rates remaining under 9.2%. Finally, we conduct control\nstudies to isolate the effects of three factors in post-training on these\nbehaviors: the choice of distillation teacher, the use of RL, and data\nselection strategy.

While flow matching offers a natural framework for\nthis task, its use has thus far primarily focused on the noise-to-data setting,\nwhile its application in the general distribution-to-distribution setting is\nunderexplored. We find that in the latter case, where the source is also a data\ndistribution to be learned from limited samples, standard flow matching fails\ndue to sparse supervision. To address this, we propose a simple and\ncomputationally efficient method that injects stochasticity into the training\nprocess by perturbing source samples and flow interpolants. On five diverse\nimaging tasks spanning biology, radiology, and astronomy, our method\nsignificantly improves generation quality, outperforming existing baselines by\nan average of 9 FID points.

This paradigm introduces\nunique challenges for LLMs' reasoning and agentic capabilities when interacting\nwith retrieval systems and the broader web. In this paper, we propose a\nreasoning-driven LLM-based pipeline to study effective reasoning behavior\npatterns in agentic search. Using this pipeline, we analyze successful agentic\nsearch trajectories and identify four beneficial reasoning behaviors:\nInformation Verification, Authority Evaluation, Adaptive Search, and Error\nRecovery. Based on these findings, we propose a technique called Behavior\nPriming to train more effective agentic search models. It synthesizes agentic\nsearch trajectories that exhibit these four behaviors and integrates them into\nthe agentic search model through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), followed by\nstandard reinforcement learning (RL). Experiments on three benchmarks (GAIA,\nWebWalker, and HLE) demonstrate that behavior priming yields over 35% gains in\nLlama3.2-3B and Qwen3-1.7B compared to directly training agentic search models\nwith RL. Crucially, we demonstrate that the desired reasoning behaviors in the\nSFT data, rather than the correctness of the final answer, is the critical\nfactor for achieving strong final performance after RL: fine-tuning on\ntrajectories with desirable reasoning behaviors but incorrect answers leads to\nbetter performance than fine-tuning on trajectories with correct answers.

Collisions\noccur when two or more players select the same arm, resulting in no reward, and\nare observed by the players involved. We consider a distributed setting without\ncentral coordination, where each player can only observe their own actions and\ncollision feedback. We propose a distributed algorithm with an adaptive,\nefficient communication protocol. The algorithm achieves near-optimal group and\nindividual regret, with a communication cost of only $\\mathcal{O}(\\log\\log T)$.\nOur experiments demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing\nbaselines.

However, irregular sampling and missing\nvalues present significant challenges. While prior methods address these\nirregularities, they often yield suboptimal results and incur high\ncomputational costs. Recent advances in regular time series generation, such as\nthe diffusion-based ImagenTime model, demonstrate strong, fast, and scalable\ngenerative capabilities by transforming time series into image representations,\nmaking them a promising solution. However, extending ImagenTime to irregular\nsequences using simple masking introduces \"unnatural\" neighborhoods, where\nmissing values replaced by zeros disrupt the learning process. To overcome\nthis, we propose a novel two-step framework: first, a Time Series Transformer\ncompletes irregular sequences, creating natural neighborhoods; second, a\nvision-based diffusion model with masking minimizes dependence on the completed\nvalues.

We challenge this view. In this\npaper, we point to existing proofs that architectures with fully parallelizable\nforward or backward passes cannot represent classes of problems specifically\ninteresting for long-running agentic tasks. We further conjecture a critical\ntime t beyond which non-recurrence-complete models fail to aggregate inputs\ncorrectly, with concrete implications for agentic systems (e.g., software\nengineering agents).

In\nthis paper, we examine three key challenges in a common class of meta-agents.\nFirst, we investigate how a meta-agent learns across iterations and find that\nsimply expanding the context with all previous agents, as proposed by previous\nworks, performs worse than ignoring prior designs entirely. We show that the\nperformance improves with an evolutionary approach. Second, although the\nmeta-agent designs multiple agents during training, it typically commits to a\nsingle agent at test time. We find that the designed agents have low behavioral\ndiversity, limiting the potential for their complementary use. Third, we assess\nwhen automated design is economically viable. We find that only in a few\ncases--specifically, two datasets--the overall cost of designing and deploying\nthe agents is lower than that of human-designed agents when deployed on over\n15,000 examples.

Behavior cloning\nsuffers from covariate shift, while Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning\n(GAIL) is notoriously unstable in multi-agent settings. We identify a key\nsource of this instability: irrelevant interaction misguidance, where a\ndiscriminator penalizes an ego vehicle's realistic behavior due to unrealistic\ninteractions among its neighbors. To address this, we propose Decomposed\nMulti-agent GAIL (DecompGAIL), which explicitly decomposes realism into ego-map\nand ego-neighbor components, filtering out misleading neighbor: neighbor and\nneighbor: map interactions. We further introduce a social PPO objective that\naugments ego rewards with distance-weighted neighborhood rewards, encouraging\noverall realism across agents. Integrated into a lightweight SMART-based\nbackbone, DecompGAIL achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WOMD Sim\nAgents 2025 benchmark.", "AI": {"tldr": "DecompGAIL\uc740 \uc790\uc728\uc8fc\ud589 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ubc0f \ub3c4\uc2dc \uc774\ub3d9\uc131 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \uad50\ud1b5 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc790\uc728\uc8fc\ud589 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uacfc \ub3c4\uc2dc \uc774\ub3d9\uc131 \uacc4\ud68d\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \uad50\ud1b5 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubaa8\ubc29 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \uad50\ud1b5 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc2e4\ud328\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "Decomposed Multi-agent GAIL(DecompGAIL)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \ud604\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uc790\uc544 \uc9c0\ub3c4(ego-map)\uc640 \uc774\uc6c3(ego-neighbor) \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub85c \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\uace0, \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \uc774\uc6c3 \uac04(interactions) \uc0c1\ud638 \uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud544\ud130\ub9c1\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc774\uc6c3\uc758 \uac70\ub9ac \uac00\uc911 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc790\uc544 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \uc99d\uac15\ud558\ub294 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 PPO \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc804\uccb4\uc758 \ud604\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "DecompGAIL\uc740 WOMD Sim Agents 2025 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uac00\ubcbc\uc6b4 SMART \uae30\ubc18 \ubc31\ubcf8\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ub41c DecompGAIL\uc740 \uc790\uc728\uc8fc\ud589\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \uad50\ud1b5 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc740 \uc790\uc728\uc8fc\ud589 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ubc0f \ub3c4\uc2dc \uc774\ub3d9\uc131 \uacc4\ud68d\uc758 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubaa8\ubc29 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \uad50\ud1b5 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc2e4\ud328\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud589\ub3d9 \ubcf5\uc81c\ub294 \uacf5\ubcc0\ub7c9 \uc774\ub3d9\uc758 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubc1b\uc73c\uba70, \uc0dd\uc131\uc801 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ubaa8\ubc29 \ud559\uc2b5(GAIL)\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd88\uc548\uc815\ud55c \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \uc545\uba85 \ub192\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \ubd88\uc548\uc815\uc131\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc6d0\uc778\uc778 \uad00\ub828 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc791\uc6a9\uc758 \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \uc778\ub3c4(misguidance)\ub97c \ud655\uc778\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uac83\uc740 \ud310\ubcc4\uae30\uac00 \uc774\uc6c3 \uac04\uc758 \ube44\ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc791\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc790\uc544 \ucc28\ub7c9\uc758 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubc8c\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 Decomposed Multi-agent GAIL(DecompGAIL)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ud604\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uc790\uc544 \uc9c0\ub3c4(ego-map)\uc640 \uc774\uc6c3(ego-neighbor) \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub85c \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\uc5ec \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \uc774\uc6c3 \uac04 \ubc0f \uc774\uc6c3:\ub9f5 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud544\ud130\ub9c1\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub610\ud55c \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 PPO \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc790\uc544 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \uac70\ub9ac \uac00\uc911 \uc774\uc6c3 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \uc99d\uac15\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \uc804\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ud604\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uc7a5\ub824\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac00\ubcbc\uc6b4 SMART \uae30\ubc18 \ubc31\ubcf8\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ub41c DecompGAIL\uc740 WOMD Sim Agents 2025 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

The\nresulting MultiCNKG encompasses 6.9K nodes across 5 types (e.g., Genes,\nDiseases, Cognitive Processes) and 11.3K edges spanning 7 types (e.g., Causes,\nAssociated with, Regulates), facilitating a multi-layered view from molecular\nto behavioral domains.

However, existing Transformers still exhibit limitations in\nsequence modeling as they tend to overemphasize temporal dependencies. This\nincurs additional computational overhead without yielding corresponding\nperformance gains. We find that the performance of Transformers is highly\ndependent on the embedding method used to learn effective representations. To\naddress this issue, we extract multivariate features to augment the effective\ninformation captured in the embedding layer, yielding multidimensional\nembeddings that convey richer and more meaningful sequence representations.\nThese representations enable Transformer-based forecasters to better understand\nthe series. Specifically, we introduce Hybrid Temporal and Multivariate\nEmbeddings (HTME). The HTME extractor integrates a lightweight temporal feature\nextraction module with a carefully designed multivariate feature extraction\nmodule to provide complementary features, thereby achieving a balance between\nmodel complexity and performance.

However, prior work shows that LLMs often produce\nhomogeneous outputs that fail to capture the rich diversity of human\nperspectives and behaviors. Thus, rather than trying to capture this diversity\nwith a single LLM agent, we propose a novel framework to construct a set of\nagents that collectively capture the diversity of a given human population.\nEach agent is an LLM whose behavior is steered by conditioning on a small set\nof human demonstrations (task-response pairs) through in-context learning. The\ncentral challenge is therefore to select a representative set of LLM agents\nfrom the exponentially large space of possible agents. We tackle this selection\nproblem from the lens of submodular optimization. In particular, we develop\nmethods that offer different trade-offs regarding time complexity and\nperformance guarantees. Extensive experiments in crowdsourcing and educational\ndomains demonstrate that our approach constructs agents that more effectively\nrepresent human populations compared to baselines.

In this paper, we propose VRPAgent, a framework that\nintegrates LLM-generated components into a metaheuristic and refines them\nthrough a novel genetic search. By using the LLM to generate problem-specific\noperators, embedded within a generic metaheuristic framework, VRPAgent keeps\ntasks manageable, guarantees correctness, and still enables the discovery of\nnovel and powerful strategies. Across multiple problems, including the\ncapacitated VRP, the VRP with time windows, and the prize-collecting VRP, our\nmethod discovers heuristic operators that outperform handcrafted methods and\nrecent learning-based approaches while requiring only a single CPU core.

Conventional methods adopt planning with actions where a executable\naction list would be provided as reference. However, this action representation\nchoice would be impractical when the environment action space is combinatorial\nexploded (e.g., open-ended real world). This naturally leads to a question: As\nenvironmental action space scales, what is the optimal action representation\nfor long-horizon agents? In this paper, we systematically study the\neffectiveness of two different action representations. The first one is\nconventional planning with actions (PwA) which is predominantly adopted for its\neffectiveness on existing benchmarks. The other one is planning with schemas\n(PwS) which instantiate an action schema into action lists (e.g., \"move [OBJ]\nto [OBJ]\" -> \"move apple to desk\") to ensure concise action space and reliable\nscalability. This alternative is motivated by its alignment with human\ncognition and its compliance with environment-imposed action format\nrestriction. We propose cognitive bandwidth perspective as a conceptual\nframework to qualitatively understand the differences between these two action\nrepresentations and empirically observe a representation-choice inflection\npoint between ALFWorld (~35 actions) and SciWorld (~500 actions), which serve\nas evidence of the need for scalable representations. We further conduct\ncontrolled experiments to study how the location of this inflection point\ninteracts with different model capacities: stronger planning proficiency shifts\nthe inflection rightward, whereas better schema instantiation shifts it\nleftward. Finally, noting the suboptimal performance of PwS agents, we provide\nan actionable guide for building more capable PwS agents for better scalable\nautonomy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc7a5\uae30 \uacc4\ud68d\uacfc \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b4\uc601\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc778 \ud589\ub3d9 \uacc4\ud68d(PwA)\uacfc \ud589\ub3d9 \uc2a4\ud0a4\ub9c8 \uacc4\ud68d(PwS)\uc744 \ube44\uad50\ud558\uace0, \uac01\uac01\uc758 \uc7a5\ub2e8\uc810\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc5ec \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc624\ud508 \uc6d4\ub4dc \uc790\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc7a5\uae30 \uacc4\ud68d\uacfc \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c LLMs\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc791\ub3d9\uc774 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud589\ub3d9 \uacc4\ud68d(PwA)\uacfc \ud589\ub3d9 \uc2a4\ud0a4\ub9c8 \uacc4\ud68d(PwS)\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub2e4\ub978 \ud589\ub3d9 \ud45c\ud604\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \uc8fc\uc5b4\uc9c4 \ud658\uacbd\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc778\uc9c0 \ub300\uc5ed\ud3ed \uad00\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud589\ub3d9 \ud45c\ud604 \uc120\ud0dd\uc758 \ubcc0\uace1\uc810\uc744 ALFWorld(\uc57d 35\uac1c \uc561\uc158)\uacfc SciWorld(\uc57d 500\uac1c \uc561\uc158) \uac04\uc5d0 \uad00\ucc30\ud558\uc600\uace0, \uc774 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud45c\ud604\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "PwS \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ucd5c\uc801\uc774 \uc544\ub2d8\uc744 \uc8fc\ubaa9\ud558\uba70, \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc790\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ub354 \uc5ed\ub7c9 \uc788\ub294 PwS \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uac00\uc774\ub4dc\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc7a5\uae30 \uacc4\ud68d\uacfc \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b4\uc601\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc624\ud508 \uc6d4\ub4dc \uc790\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9 \ubaa9\ub85d\uc774 \ucc38\uc870\ub85c \uc81c\uacf5\ub418\ub294 \ud589\ub3d9 \uae30\ubc18 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \ucc44\ud0dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ud658\uacbd\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9 \uacf5\uac04\uc774 \uc870\ud569\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3ed\ubc1c\ud560 \uacbd\uc6b0, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9 \ud45c\ud604 \uc120\ud0dd\uc740 \ube44\ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc774 \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7fd\uac8c \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: \ud658\uacbd \ud589\ub3d9 \uacf5\uac04\uc774 \ud655\uc7a5\ub428\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \uc7a5\uae30 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9 \ud45c\ud604\uc740 \ubb34\uc5c7\uc778\uac00?

Standard recurrent or transformer\nmodels struggle with retaining and leveraging long-term dependencies: context\nwindows truncate history, while naive memory extensions fail under scale and\nsparsity. We propose ELMUR (External Layer Memory with Update/Rewrite), a\ntransformer architecture with structured external memory. Each layer maintains\nmemory embeddings, interacts with them via bidirectional cross-attention, and\nupdates them through an Least Recently Used (LRU) memory module using\nreplacement or convex blending. ELMUR extends effective horizons up to 100,000\ntimes beyond the attention window and achieves a 100% success rate on a\nsynthetic T-Maze task with corridors up to one million steps. In POPGym, it\noutperforms baselines on more than half of the tasks. On MIKASA-Robo\nsparse-reward manipulation tasks with visual observations, it nearly doubles\nthe performance of strong baselines. These results demonstrate that structured,\nlayer-local external memory offers a simple and scalable approach to decision\nmaking under partial observability.", "AI": {"tldr": "ELMUR\uc740 \ubd80\ubd84 \uad00\uce21 \ud558\uc758 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \ubcc0\ud615\uae30 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub85c, \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc678\ubd80 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc7a5\uae30\uc801 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad00\ub9ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud604\uc2e4 \uc138\uacc4\uc758 \ub85c\ubd07 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ubd80\ubd84 \uad00\uce21\uacfc \uae34 \uc2dc\uac04 \ubc94\uc704\uc5d0\uc11c \ud589\ub3d9\ud574\uc57c \ud558\uba70, \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub2e8\uc11c\uac00 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\uae30 \ud6e8\uc52c \uc804\uc5d0 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0a0 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "ELMUR\uc740 \uac01 \uce35\uc774 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \uc591\ubc29\ud5a5 \uad50\ucc28 \uc8fc\uc758\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc791\uc6a9\ud558\uba70, LRU \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ud558\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc678\ubd80 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\ub97c \uac16\ucd98 \ubcc0\ud615\uae30 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc774\ub2e4.", "result": "ELMUR\uc740 \uc8fc\uc758 \ucc3d\uc744 \ucd5c\ub300 100,000\ubc30 \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uace0, 100\ub9cc \ub2e8\uacc4\uc758 \ubcf5\ub3c4\ub85c \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc9c4 \ud569\uc131 T-Maze \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c 100% \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uce35-\ub85c\uceec \uc678\ubd80 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\ub294 \ubd80\ubd84 \uad00\uce21 \ud558\uc758 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc5d0 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud558\uace0 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud604\uc2e4 \uc138\uacc4\uc758 \ub85c\ubd07 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ubd80\ubd84 \uad00\uce21\uacfc \uae34 \uc2dc\uac04 \ubc94\uc704\uc5d0\uc11c \ud589\ub3d9\ud574\uc57c \ud558\uba70, \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub2e8\uc11c\uac00 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\uae30 \ud6e8\uc52c \uc804\uc5d0 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0a0 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \ud604\ub300 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uacfc\uac70\uc758 \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc21c\uac04\uc801\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4\uc5d0\ub9cc \uc758\uc874\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud45c\uc900 \uc21c\ud658 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc774\ub098 \ubcc0\ud615\uae30 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc7a5\uae30 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uc73c\uba70, \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc708\ub3c4\uc6b0\ub294 \uc5ed\uc0ac\ub97c \uc808\ub2e8\ud558\uace0 \uc21c\uc9c4\ud55c \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ud655\uc7a5\uc740 \uaddc\ubaa8\uc640 \ud76c\uc18c\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\ud328\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 ELMUR(\uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8/\uc7ac\uc791\uc131 \uc678\ubd80 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

Meanwhile, biological\norganisms survive, thrive, and care for each other in an open-ended physical\nworld with relative ease and efficiency. Understanding the role of the\nconditions of life in this disparity can aid in developing more robust,\nadaptive, and caring artificial agents. Here we define two minimal conditions\nfor physical embodiment inspired by the existentialist phenomenology of Martin\nHeidegger: being-in-the-world (the agent is a part of the environment) and\nbeing-towards-death (unless counteracted, the agent drifts toward terminal\nstates due to the second law of thermodynamics). We propose that from these\nconditions we can obtain both a homeostatic drive - aimed at maintaining\nintegrity and avoiding death by expending energy to learn and act - and an\nintrinsic drive to continue to do so in as many ways as possible. Drawing\ninspiration from Friedrich Nietzsche's existentialist concept of will-to-power,\nwe examine how intrinsic drives to maximize control over future states, e.g.,\nempowerment, allow agents to increase the probability that they will be able to\nmeet their future homeostatic needs, thereby enhancing their capacity to\nmaintain physical integrity. We formalize these concepts within a reinforcement\nlearning framework, which enables us to examine how intrinsically driven\nembodied agents learning in open-ended multi-agent environments may cultivate\nthe capacities for open-endedness and care.ov", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc874\uc7ac\uc758 \ucd5c\uc18c \uc870\uac74\uc744 \uc815\uc758\ud558\uace0,

Nonetheless, long-horizon decision making remains difficult for GCRL\nagents due to temporal credit assignment and error accumulation, and the\noffline setting amplifies these effects. To alleviate this issue, we introduce\nTest-Time Graph Search (TTGS), a lightweight planning approach to solve the\nGCRL task. TTGS accepts any state-space distance or cost signal, builds a\nweighted graph over dataset states, and performs fast search to assemble a\nsequence of subgoals that a frozen policy executes. When the base learner is\nvalue-based, the distance is derived directly from the learned goal-conditioned\nvalue function, so no handcrafted metric is needed. TTGS requires no changes to\ntraining, no additional supervision, no online interaction, and no privileged\ninformation, and it runs entirely at inference.

However, existing\nbenchmarks for this task suffer from a fundamental methodological trilemma,\nforcing a trade-off between scientific relevance, scalability, and resistance\nto memorization. Furthermore, they oversimplify discovery as static function\nfitting, failing to capture the authentic scientific process of uncovering\nembedded laws through the interactive exploration of complex model systems. To\naddress these critical gaps, we introduce NewtonBench, a benchmark comprising\n324 scientific law discovery tasks across 12 physics domains. Our design\nmitigates the evaluation trilemma by using metaphysical shifts - systematic\nalterations of canonical laws - to generate a vast suite of problems that are\nscalable, scientifically relevant, and memorization-resistant. Moreover, we\nelevate the evaluation from static function fitting to interactive model\ndiscovery, requiring agents to experimentally probe simulated complex systems\nto uncover hidden principles. Our extensive experiment reveals a clear but\nfragile capability for discovery in frontier LLMs: this ability degrades\nprecipitously with increasing system complexity and exhibits extreme\nsensitivity to observational noise. Notably, we uncover a paradoxical effect of\ntool assistance: providing a code interpreter can hinder more capable models by\ninducing a premature shift from exploration to exploitation, causing them to\nsatisfice on suboptimal solutions. These results demonstrate that robust,\ngeneralizable discovery in complex, interactive environments remains the core\nchallenge. By providing a scalable, robust, and scientifically authentic\ntestbed, NewtonBench offers a crucial tool for measuring true progress and\nguiding the development of next-generation AI agents capable of genuine\nscientific discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubb3c\ub9ac\ud559 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \ubc95\uce59 \ubc1c\uacac\uc744

The downstream decision makers select actions \"as\nif\" the state predictions are correct, and the goal of the learner is to\nproduce predictions such that all downstream decision makers choose actions\nthat give them worst-case utility guarantees while minimizing worst-case\nconstraint violation. Within this framework, we give the first algorithm that\nobtains simultaneous \\emph{dynamic regret} guarantees for all of the agents --\nwhere regret for each agent is measured against a potentially changing sequence\nof actions across rounds of interaction, while also ensuring vanishing\nconstraint violation for each agent.

Current MLE benchmarks suffer from\nlow scalability and limited applicability because they rely on static, manually\ncurated tasks, demanding extensive time and manual effort to produce. We\nintroduce MLE-Smith, a fully automated multi-agent pipeline, to transform raw\ndatasets into competition-style MLE challenges through an efficient\ngenerate-verify-execute paradigm for scaling MLE tasks with verifiable quality,\nreal-world usability, and rich diversity. The proposed multi-agent pipeline in\nMLE-Smith drives structured task design and standardized refactoring, coupled\nwith a hybrid verification mechanism that enforces strict structural rules and\nhigh-level semantic soundness. It further validates empirical solvability and\nreal-world fidelity through interactive execution.

Still, its\ninterconnectivity exposes critical infrastructure to sophisticated cyber\nthreats, including adversarial attacks designed to bypass traditional\nsafeguards. Unlike general IoT risks, IoE threats have heightened public safety\nconsequences, demanding resilient solutions. From the networking-level\nsafeguard perspective, we propose a Graph Structure Learning (GSL)-based\nsafeguards framework that jointly optimizes graph topology and node\nrepresentations to resist adversarial network model manipulation inherently.\nThrough a conceptual overview, architectural discussion, and case study on a\nsecurity dataset, we demonstrate GSL's superior robustness over representative\nmethods, offering practitioners a viable path to secure IoE networks against\nevolving attacks. This work highlights the potential of GSL to enhance the\nresilience and reliability of future IoE networks for practitioners managing\ncritical infrastructure. Lastly, we identify key open challenges and propose\nfuture research directions in this novel research area.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 IoE(Internet of Energy)\ub97c \uc704\ud574 GSL(Graph Structure Learning) \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc548\uc804 \uc7a5\uce58 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \uc704\ud611\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc800\ud56d\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ub17c\uc758\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "IoE\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc5f0\uacb0\uc131\uc740 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc778\ud504\ub77c\ub97c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \uc704\ud611\uc5d0 \ub178\ucd9c\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "GSL \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc548\uc804 \uc7a5\uce58 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ud1a0\ud3f4\ub85c\uc9c0\uc640 \ub178\ub4dc \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "GSL\uc740 \ub300\ud45c\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "GSL\uc740 \ubbf8\ub798 IoE \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \ud68c\ubcf5\ub825 \ubc0f \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0\uc758 \uc778\ud130\ub137(IoE)\uc740 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc9c0\uc18d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uad6c\ud604\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 IoT \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \ud1b5\uc2e0\uacfc \uc804\ub825\ub9dd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc0c1\ud638 \uc5f0\uacb0\uc131\uc740 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc548\uc804 \uc7a5\uce58\ub97c \uc6b0\ud68c\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uc815\uad50\ud55c \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \uc704\ud611\uc5d0 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc778\ud504\ub77c\ub97c \ub178\ucd9c\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 IoT \uc704\ud5d8\uacfc\ub294 \ub2ec\ub9ac, IoE \uc704\ud611\uc740 \uacf5\uacf5 \uc548\uc804\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\uac00 \ub354\uc6b1 \uc2ec\uac01\ud558\uc5ec \ud68c\ubcf5\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc774 \uc694\uad6c\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud0b9 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc548\uc804 \uc7a5\uce58 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc801\ub300\uc801\uc778 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ubaa8\ub378 \uc870\uc791\uc5d0 \uc800\ud56d\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ud1a0\ud3f4\ub85c\uc9c0\uc640 \ub178\ub4dc \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uacf5\ub3d9 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 GSL(\uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uad6c\uc870 \ud559\uc2b5) \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc548\uc804 \uc7a5\uce58 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac1c\ub150\uc801 \uac1c\uc694, \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \ub17c\uc758 \ubc0f \ubcf4\uc548 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0ac\ub840 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 GSL\uc774 \ub300\ud45c\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uc774\ub294 IoE \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c4\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uacf5\uaca9\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc548\uc804\ud558\uac8c \ubcf4\ud638\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc791\uc5c5\uc740 GSL\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc778\ud504\ub77c\ub97c \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \uc2e4\ubb34\uc790\uc5d0\uac8c \ud5a5\ud6c4 IoE \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \ud68c\ubcf5\ub825\uacfc \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc8fc\uc694 \uac1c\ubc29 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0 \uc774 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc5f0\uad6c \uc601\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c \ubbf8\ub798 \uc5f0\uad6c \ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}
