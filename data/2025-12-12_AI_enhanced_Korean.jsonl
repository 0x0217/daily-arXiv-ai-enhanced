Among numerous anti-counterfeiting techniques, leveraging inherent, unclonable microscopic irregularities of paper surfaces is an accurate and cost-effective solution. Prior work of this approach has focused on enabling ubiquitous acquisition of these physically unclonable features (PUFs). However, we will show that existing authentication methods relying on paper surface PUFs may be vulnerable to adversaries, resulting in a gap between technological feasibility and secure real-world deployment. This gap is investigated through formalizing an operational framework for paper-PUF-based authentication. Informed by this framework, we reveal system-level vulnerabilities across both physical and digital domains, designing physical denial-of-service and digital forgery attacks to disrupt proper authentication. The effectiveness of the designed attacks underscores the strong need for security countermeasures for reliable and resilient authentication based on paper PUFs. The proposed framework further facilitates a comprehensive, stage-by-stage security analysis, guiding the design of future counterfeit prevention systems. This analysis delves into potential attack strategies, offering a foundational understanding of how various system components, such as physical features and verification processes, might be exploited

Designing detectors for filtering is an effective defense method, but most detectors will be compromised by adversarial samples. Currently, most studies exposing AIGC security issues assume information on model structure and data distribution. In real applications, attackers query and interfere with models that provide services in the form of application programming interfaces (APIs), which constitutes the black-box decision-based attack paradigm. However, to the best of our knowledge, decision-based attacks on AIGC detectors remain unexplored. In this study, we propose \\textbf{FBA$^2$D}: a frequency-based black-box attack method for AIGC detection to fill the research gap. Motivated by frequency-domain discrepancies between generated and real images, we develop a decision-based attack that leverages the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) for fine-grained spectral partitioning and selects frequency bands as query subspaces, improving both query efficiency and image quality. Moreover, attacks on AIGC detectors should mitigate initialization failures, preserve image quality, and operate under strict query budgets.

In many applications and agents, the input data originates from multiple sources, with each source contributing a segment of the overall input. In these multi-source scenarios, an attacker may control only a subset of the sources and contaminate the corresponding segments, but typically does not know the order in which the segments are arranged within the input. Existing prompt injection attacks either assume that the entire input data comes from a single source under the attacker's control or ignore the uncertainty in the ordering of segments from different sources. As a result, their success is limited in domains involving multi-source data.\n  In this work, we propose ObliInjection, the first prompt injection attack targeting LLM applications and agents with multi-source input data. ObliInjection introduces two key technical innovations: the order-oblivious loss, which quantifies the likelihood that the LLM will complete the attacker-chosen task regardless of how the clean and contaminated segments are ordered; and the orderGCG algorithm, which is tailored to minimize the order-oblivious loss and optimize the contaminated segments. Comprehensive experiments across three datasets spanning diverse application domains and twelve LLMs demonstrate that ObliInjection is highly effective, even when only one out of 6-100 segments in the input data is contaminated.", "AI": {"tldr": "ObliInjection\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \ucd9c\ucc98 \uc785\ub825 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 LLM \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc8fc\uc785 \uacf5\uaca9\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc8fc\uc785 \uacf5\uaca9\ub4e4\uc740 \uc804\uccb4 \uc785\ub825 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \uacf5\uaca9\uc790\uc758 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc544\ub798\uc5d0 \uc788\ub294 \ub2e8\uc77c \ucd9c\ucc98\uc5d0\uc11c \uc628\ub2e4\uace0 \uac00\uc815\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ub2e4\ub978 \ucd9c\ucc98\uc5d0\uc11c \uc624\ub294 \uc138\uadf8\uba3c\ud2b8\uc758 \uc21c\uc11c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \ubb34\uc2dc\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc911 \ucd9c\ucc98 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc601\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc131\uacf5\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "ObliInjection\uc740 \uc21c\uc11c\uc5d0 \ubb34\uad00\ud55c \uc190\uc2e4\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec LLM\uc774 \uc624\uc5fc\ub41c \uc138\uadf8\uba3c\ud2b8\uc758 \uc21c\uc11c\uc640 \uad00\uacc4\uc5c6\uc774 \uacf5\uaca9\uc790\uac00 \uc120\ud0dd\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc644\ub8cc\ud560 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\uace0, \uc21c\uc11cGCG \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc624\uc5fc\ub41c \uc138\uadf8\uba3c\ud2b8\ub97c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uacfc 12\uac00\uc9c0 LLM\uc5d0 \uac78\uce5c \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574, ObliInjection\uc740 \uc785\ub825 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 6-100\uac1c \uc138\uadf8\uba3c\ud2b8 \uc911 \ub2e8 \ud558\ub098\ub9cc \uc624\uc5fc\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc5b4\ub3c4 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "ObliInjection\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \ucd9c\ucc98 \uc785\ub825 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 LLM \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacf5\uaca9 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc5ec, \uacf5\uaca9\uc790\uac00 \uc138\uadf8\uba3c\ud2b8\uc758 \uc21c\uc11c\ub97c \uc54c\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud574\ub3c4 \uc131\uacf5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc8fc\uc785 \uacf5\uaca9\uc740 LLM\uc758 \uc785\ub825 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc624\uc5fc\uc2dc\ucf1c \uacf5\uaca9\uc790\uac00 \uc120\ud0dd\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc644\ub8cc\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud55c\ub2e4. \ub9ce\uc740 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uacfc \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc785\ub825 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ucd9c\ucc98\uc5d0\uc11c originate\ud558\uba70, \uac01 \ucd9c\ucc98\ub294 \uc804\uccb4 \uc785\ub825\uc758 \uc77c\ubd80\ub97c \uae30\uc5ec\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \ucd9c\ucc98 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uacf5\uaca9\uc790\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e8\uc9c0 \uc77c\ubd80 \ucd9c\ucc98\ub9cc\uc744 \uc81c\uc5b4\ud558\uace0 \ud574\ub2f9 \uc138\uadf8\uba3c\ud2b8\ub97c \uc624\uc5fc\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc785\ub825 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc138\uadf8\uba3c\ud2b8\uac00 \ubc30\uc5f4\ub418\ub294 \uc21c\uc11c\ub97c \uc54c\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc8fc\uc785 \uacf5\uaca9\uc740 \uc804\uccb4 \uc785\ub825 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \uacf5\uaca9\uc790\uc758 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc544\ub798\uc5d0 \uc788\ub294 \ub2e8\uc77c \ucd9c\ucc98\uc5d0\uc11c \uc628\ub2e4\uace0 \uac00\uc815\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ub2e4\ub978 \ucd9c\ucc98\uc5d0\uc11c \uc624\ub294 \uc138\uadf8\uba3c\ud2b8\uc758 \uc21c\uc11c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \ubb34\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \uacb0\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\uc911 \ucd9c\ucc98 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \ud3ec\ud568\ub41c \uc601\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\uacf5\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ucd9c\ucc98 \uc785\ub825 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 LLM \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uacfc \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc8fc\uc785 \uacf5\uaca9\uc778 ObliInjection\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

In response, the research community has proposed defenses based on randomized and (de)randomized smoothing. However, these techniques remain susceptible to attacks that insert large adversarial payloads. To address these limitations, we propose a novel defense mechanism designed to harden end-to-end malware detectors by leveraging masking at the byte level. This mechanism operates by generating multiple masked versions of the input file, independently classifying each version, and then applying a threshold-based voting mechanism to produce the final classification. Key to this defense is a deterministic masking strategy that systematically strides a mask across the entire input file. Unlike randomized smoothing defenses, which randomly mask or delete bytes, this structured approach ensures coverage of the file over successive versions. In the best-case scenario, this strategy fully occludes the adversarial payload, effectively neutralizing its influence on the model's decision. In the worst-case scenario, it partially occludes the adversarial payload, reducing its impact on the model's predictions. By occluding the adversarial payload in one or more masked versions, this defense ensures that some input versions remain representative of the file's original intent, allowing the voting mechanism to suppress the influence of the adversarial payload. Results achieved on the EMBER and BODMAS datasets demonstrate the suitability of our defense, outperforming randomized and (de)randomized smoothing defenses against adversarial examples generated with a wide range of functionality-preserving manipulations while maintaining high accuracy on clean examples.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubc14\uc774\ud2b8 \uc218\uc900\uc758

Yet most evaluations reduce deception to static classification, ignoring the interactive, adversarial, and longitudinal nature of real deceptive dynamics. Large language models (LLMs) can deceive convincingly but remain weak at detecting deception in peers. We present WOLF, a multi-agent social deduction benchmark based on Werewolf that enables separable measurement of deception production and detection. WOLF embeds role-grounded agents (Villager, Werewolf, Seer, Doctor) in a programmable LangGraph state machine with strict night-day cycles, debate turns, and majority voting. Every statement is a distinct analysis unit, with self-assessed honesty from speakers and peer-rated deceptiveness from others. Deception is categorized via a standardized taxonomy (omission, distortion, fabrication, misdirection), while suspicion scores are longitudinally smoothed to capture both immediate judgments and evolving trust dynamics. Structured logs preserve prompts, outputs, and state transitions for full reproducibility. Across 7,320 statements and 100 runs, Werewolves produce deceptive statements in 31% of turns, while peer detection achieves 71-73% precision with ~52% overall accuracy. Precision is higher for identifying Werewolves, though false positives occur against Villagers. Suspicion toward Werewolves rises from ~52% to over 60% across rounds, while suspicion toward Villagers and the Doctor stabilizes near 44-46%. This divergence shows that extended interaction improves recall against liars without compounding errors against truthful roles. WOLF moves deception evaluation beyond static datasets, offering a dynamic, controlled testbed for measuring deceptive and detective capacity in adversarial multi-agent interaction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uae30\ub9cc\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc778 WOLF\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Yet screening agents must master conversational timing, prosody, backchannels, and what to attend to in faces and speech for Depression and PTSD. Most simulators omit policy learning with nonverbal dynamics; many controllers chase task accuracy while underweighting trust, pacing, and rapport. We virtualise the humanoid as a conversational agent to train without hardware burden. Our agent-centred, simulation-first pipeline turns interview data into 276 Unreal Engine MetaHuman patients with synchronised speech, gaze/face, and head-torso poses, plus PHQ-8 and PCL-C flows. A perception-fusion-policy loop decides what and when to speak, when to backchannel, and how to avoid interruptions, under a safety shield. Training uses counterfactual replay (bounded nonverbal perturbations) and an uncertainty-aware turn manager that probes to reduce diagnostic ambiguity. Results are simulation-only; the humanoid is the transfer target. In comparing three controllers, a custom TD3 (Twin Delayed DDPG) outperformed PPO and CEM, achieving near-ceiling coverage with steadier pace at comparable rewards. Decision-quality analyses show negligible turn overlap, aligned cut timing, fewer clarification prompts, and shorter waits. Performance stays stable under modality dropout and a renderer swap, and rankings hold on a held-out patient split. Contributions: (1) an agent-centred simulator that turns interviews into 276 interactive patients with bounded nonverbal counterfactuals; (2) a safe learning loop that treats timing and rapport as first-class control variables; (3) a comparative study (TD3 vs PPO/CEM) with clear gains in completeness and social timing; and (4) ablations and robustness analyses explaining the gains and enabling

Built around a standardized \\texttt{Dialog} representation, SDialog provides: (1) persona-driven multi-agent simulation with composable orchestration for controlled, synthetic dialog generation, (2) comprehensive evaluation combining linguistic metrics, LLM-as-a-judge and functional correctness validators, (3) mechanistic interpretability tools for activation inspection and steering via feature ablation and induction, and (4) audio generation with full acoustic simulation including 3D room modeling and microphone effects. The toolkit integrates with all major LLM backends, enabling mixed-backend experiments under a unified API.

We evaluate ten cybersecurity professionals alongside six existing AI agents and ARTEMIS, our new agent scaffold, on a large university network consisting of ~8,000 hosts across 12 subnets. ARTEMIS is a multi-agent framework featuring dynamic prompt generation, arbitrary sub-agents, and automatic vulnerability triaging. In our comparative study, ARTEMIS placed second overall, discovering 9 valid vulnerabilities with an 82% valid submission rate and outperforming 9 of 10 human participants. While existing scaffolds such as Codex and CyAgent underperformed relative to most human participants, ARTEMIS demonstrated technical sophistication and submission quality comparable to the strongest participants. We observe that AI agents offer advantages in systematic enumeration, parallel exploitation, and cost -- certain ARTEMIS variants cost $18/hour versus $60/hour for professional penetration testers.

However, GUI automation includes a wide range of tasks, from document processing to online shopping, from CAD to video editing. Diversity between particular tasks requires MLLMs for GUI automation to have heterogeneous capabilities and master multidimensional expertise, raising problems on constructing such a model. To address such challenge, we propose GAIR: GUI Automation via Information-Joint Reasoning and Group Reflection, a novel MLLM-based GUI automation agent framework designed for integrating knowledge and combining capabilities from heterogeneous models to build GUI automation agent systems with higher performance. Since different GUI-specific MLLMs are trained on different dataset and thus have different strengths, GAIR introduced a general-purpose MLLM for jointly processing the information from multiple GUI-specific models, further enhancing performance of the agent framework. The general-purpose MLLM also serves as decision maker, trying to execute a reasonable operation based on previously gathered information. When the general-purpose model thinks that there isn't sufficient information for a reasonable decision, GAIR would transit into group reflection status, where the general-purpose model would provide GUI-specific models with different instructions and hints based on their strengths and weaknesses, driving them to gather information with more significance and accuracy that can support deeper reasoning and decision. We evaluated the effectiveness and reliability of GAIR through extensive experiments on GUI benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 GUI \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub97c

Most existing structure-based attacks rely on gradient-based heuristics or local connectivity patterns, and treat edges as equally important candidates for manipulation. In this paper, we propose Spectral Edge Attacks (SEA), a new family of adversarial attacks that explicitly leverage spectral robustness evaluation to guide structural perturbations. Our key idea is to compute a spectral embedding that captures the most fragile directions of the input manifold and to use it to assign a robustness score to each edge or non-edge. Based on these scores, we introduce two complementary attack variants: (i) a Spade-guided deletion attack that removes the most spectrally robust edges, and (ii) a Spade-guided addition attack that inserts edges between nodes that are maximally incompatible in the fragile spectral space. Both attacks operate at the graph level, are model-aware but conceptually simple, and can be plugged into existing GNN architectures without requiring gradients.

We define agentic systems as goal-directed, tool-using decision makers operating in closed loops, and show how reliability emerges from principled componentisation (goal manager, planner, tool-router, executor, memory, verifiers, safety monitor, telemetry), disciplined interfaces (schema-constrained, validated, least-privilege tool calls), and explicit control and assurance loops. Building on classical foundations, we propose a practical taxonomy-tool-using agents, memory-augmented agents, planning and self-improvement agents, multi-agent systems, and embodied or web agents - and analyse how each pattern reshapes the reliability envelope and failure modes.

Nidd"], "title": "Supporting Dynamic Agentic Workloads: How Data and Agents Interact", "comment": null, "summary": "The rise of multi-agent systems powered by large language models (LLMs) and specialized reasoning agents exposes fundamental limitations in today's data management architectures. Traditional databases and data fabrics were designed for static, well-defined workloads, whereas agentic systems exhibit dynamic, context-driven, and collaborative behaviors. Agents continuously decompose tasks, shift attention across modalities, and share intermediate results with peers - producing non-deterministic, multi-modal workloads that strain conventional query optimizers and caching mechanisms. We propose an Agent-Centric Data Fabric, a unified architecture that rethinks how data systems serve, optimize, coordinate, and learn from agentic workloads. To achieve this we exploit the concepts of attention-guided data retrieval, semantic micro-caching for context-driven agent federations, predictive data prefetching and quorum-based data serving. Together, these mechanisms enable agents to access representative data faster and more efficiently, while reducing redundant queries, data movement, and inference load across systems. By framing data systems as adaptive collaborators, instead of static executors, we outline new research directions toward behaviorally responsive data infrastructures, where caching, probing, and orchestration jointly enable efficient, context-rich data exchange among dynamic, reasoning-driven agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc694\uc778 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c

Conventional computational fluid dynamics simulations provide accurate insights but are prohibitively slow and require specialized expertise. Clinical imaging alternatives such as 4D Flow MRI offer direct in-vivo measurements, yet their spatial resolution remains insufficient to capture the fine-scale shear patterns that drive endothelial remodeling and rupture risk while being extremely impractical and expensive.\n  We present a graph neural network surrogate model that bridges this gap by reproducing full-field hemodynamics directly from vascular geometries in less than one minute per cardiac cycle. Trained on a comprehensive dataset of high-fidelity simulations of patient-specific aneurysms, our architecture combines graph transformers with autoregressive predictions to accurately simulate blood flow, wall shear stress, and oscillatory shear index. The model generalizes across unseen patient geometries and inflow conditions without mesh-specific calibration. Beyond accelerating simulation, our framework establishes the foundation for clinically interpretable hemodynamic prediction. By enabling near real-time inference integrated with existing imaging pipelines, it allows direct comparison with hospital phase-diagram assessments and extends them with physically grounded, high-resolution flow fields.\n  This work transforms high-fidelity simulations from an expert-only research tool into a deployable, data-driven decision support system. Our full pipeline delivers high-resolution hemodynamic predictions within minutes of patient imaging, without requiring computational specialists, marking a step-change toward real-time, bedside

An orchestrator receives a human specification written in natural language and converts it into a PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language) model, where the domain and problem are iteratively refined by sub-modules (agents) to address common planning requirements, such as time constraints and optimality, as well as ambiguities and contradictions that may exist in the human specification. The validated domain and problem are then passed to an external planning engine to generate a plan. The orchestrator and agents are powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and require no human intervention at any stage of the process. Finally, a module translates the final plan back into natural language to improve human readability while maintaining the correctness of each step. We demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of our framework across various domains and tasks, including the Google NaturalPlan benchmark and PlanBench, as well as planning problems like Blocksworld and the Tower of Hanoi (where LLMs are known to struggle even with small instances). Our framework can be integrated with any PDDL planning engine and validator (such as Fast Downward, LPG, POPF, VAL, and uVAL, which we have tested) and represents a significant step toward end-to-end planning aided by LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uac80\uc99d\uc790\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc885\ub2e8 \uac04 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4\ub85c \uc791\uc131\ub41c \uc0ac\uc591\uc744 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uace0 \uacc4\ud68d \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ucc3e\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc624\ucf00\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ud130\uac00 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uc0ac\uc591\uc744 PDDL \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\uace0, \uc11c\ube0c \ubaa8\ub4c8(\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8)\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uacfc \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac1c\uc120\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uacfc \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \uc720\uc5f0\uc131\uacfc \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "LLM\uc744 \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc73c\ub85c \uc885\ub2e8 \uac04 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \ud5a5\ud55c \uc911\ub300\ud55c \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\uba70, \uae30\uc874\uc758 PDDL \uacc4\ud68d \uc5d4\uc9c4 \ubc0f \uac80\uc99d\uae30\uc640 \ud1b5\ud569 \uac00\ub2a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac80\uc99d\uc790\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ub418\ub294 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc885\ub2e8 \uac04 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc624\ucf00\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ud130\ub294 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4\ub85c \uc791\uc131\ub41c \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc0ac\uc591\uc744 \uc218\uc2e0\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c PDDL(\uacc4\ud68d \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc815\uc758 \uc5b8\uc5b4) \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5ec\uae30\uc11c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uacfc \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc81c\uc57d \ubc0f \ucd5c\uc801\uc131\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18 \uacc4\ud68d \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uacfc \uc778\uac04 \uc0ac\uc591\uc5d0 \uc874\uc7ac\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubaa8\ud638\uc131\uacfc \ubaa8\uc21c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud558\uc704 \ubaa8\ub4c8(\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8)\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac1c\uc120\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac80\uc99d\ub41c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uacfc \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \uc678\ubd80 \uacc4\ud68d \uc5d4\uc9c4\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\ub2ec\ub418\uc5b4 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc624\ucf00\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ud130\uc640 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\ub85c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ub418\uba70, \uacfc\uc815\uc758 \uc5b4\ub5a4 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc778\uac04 \uac1c\uc785\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c, \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc774 \ucd5c\uc885 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \ub2e4\uc2dc \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4\ub85c \ubc88\uc5ed\ud558\uc5ec \uac01 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc778\uac04 \uce5c\ud654\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Google NaturalPlan \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc640 PlanBench\ub97c \ube44\ub86f\ud55c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uacfc \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \uc720\uc5f0\uc131\uacfc \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \ube14\ub85d\uc2a4\uc6d4\ub4dc(Blocksworld)\uc640 \ud558\ub178\uc774\uc758 \ud0d1(Tower of Hanoi)\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uacc4\ud68d \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 Fast Downward, LPG, POPF, VAL, uVAL\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ubaa8\ub4e0 PDDL \uacc4\ud68d \uc5d4\uc9c4 \ubc0f \uac80\uc99d\uae30\uc640 \ud1b5\ud569\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, LLM\uc774 \uc791\uc740 \uc0ac\ub840\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \uc54c\ub824\uc9c4 \uc774 \uc601\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c \uc885\ub2e8 \uac04 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc911\ub300\ud55c \ubc1c\uac78\uc74c\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Each agent is represented by a personalized value space, a vector space encoding the internal dimensions through which the agent interprets and evaluates meaning. Beliefs are formalized as structured vectors-abstract beings-whose transmission is mediated by linear interpretation maps. A belief survives communication only if it avoids the null spaces of these maps, yielding a structural criterion for intelligibility, miscommunication, and belief death.\n  Within this framework, I show how belief distortion, motivational drift, counterfactual evaluation, and the limits of mutual understanding arise from purely algebraic constraints. A central result-\"the No-Null-Space Leadership Condition\"-characterizes leadership as a property of representational reachability rather than persuasion or authority. More broadly, the model explains how abstract beings can propagate, mutate, or disappear as they traverse diverse cognitive geometries.\n  The account unifies insights from conceptual spaces, social epistemology, and AI value alignment by grounding meaning preservation in structural compatibility rather than shared information or rationality. I argue that this cognitive-geometric perspective clarifies the epistemic boundaries of influence in both human and artificial systems, and offers a general foundation for analyzing belief dynamics

Understanding neural network OOD generalization is paramount to their successful deployment in experimental workflows, especially when ground-truth knowledge about the experiment is hard to establish or experimental conditions significantly vary. With inherent access to ground-truth information and fine-grained control of underlying distributions, simulation-based data curation facilitates precise investigation of OOD generalization behavior. Here, we probe generalization with respect to imaging conditions of neural network segmentation models for high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) imaging of nanoparticles, training and measuring the OOD generalization of over 12,000 neural networks using synthetic data generated via random structure sampling and multislice simulation. Using the HRTEM contrast transfer function, we further develop a framework to compare information content of HRTEM datasets and quantify OOD domain shifts. We demonstrate that neural network segmentation models enjoy significant performance stability, but will smoothly and predictably worsen as imaging conditions shift from the training distribution. Lastly, we consider limitations of our approach in explaining other OOD shifts, such as of the atomic structures, and discuss complementary techniques for understanding generalization in such settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc758 OOD \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uc774\ud574\ub294 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc5d0\uc758 \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc778 \ubc30\uce58\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 12,000\uac1c \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc758 OOD \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uace0 HRTEM \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b \uac04 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ube44\uad50\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc758 OOD \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uc774\ud574\ub294 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801 \uc870\uac74\uc758 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc774 \ud074 \ub54c, \uadf8\ub4e4\uc758 \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc778 \ubc30\uce58\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\uace0\ud574\uc0c1\ub3c4 \uc804\uc1a1 \uc804\uc790 \ud604\ubbf8\uacbd(HRTEM) \uc774\ubbf8\uc9d5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \ubd84\ud560 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0, \ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c 12,000\uac1c \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc758 OOD \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \uce21\uc815\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.

However, existing MAPF evaluation frameworks typically rely on simplified robot models, leaving a substantial gap between algorithmic benchmarks and practical performance. Recent frameworks such as SMART, incorporate kinodynamic modeling and offer the MAPF community a platform for large-scale, realistic evaluation. Building on this capability, this work investigates how key planner design choices influence performance under realistic execution settings. We systematically study three fundamental factors: (1) the relationship between solution optimality and execution performance, (2) the sensitivity of system performance to inaccuracies in kinodynamic modeling, and (3) the interaction between model accuracy and plan optimality. Empirically, we examine these factors to understand how these design choices affect performance in realistic scenarios.

This study investigates whether lightweight additive models -- Facebook Prophet (FBP) and NeuralProphet (NP) -- can deliver competitive forecasts for particulate matter (PM$_{2.5}$, PM$_{10}$) in Beijing, China. Using multi-year pollutant and meteorological data, we applied systematic feature selection (correlation, mutual information, mRMR), leakage-safe scaling, and chronological data splits. Both models were trained with pollutant and precursor regressors, with NP additionally leveraging lagged dependencies. For context, two machine learning baselines (LSTM, LightGBM) and one traditional statistical model (SARIMAX) were also implemented. Performance was evaluated on a 7-day holdout using MAE, RMSE, and $R^2$. Results show that FBP consistently outperformed NP, SARIMAX, and the learning-based baselines, achieving test $R^2$ above 0.94 for both pollutants. These findings demonstrate that interpretable additive models remain competitive with both traditional and complex approaches, offering a practical balance of accuracy, transparency, and ease of deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub3c4\uc2dc \ub300\uae30 \uc624\uc5fc\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc608\uce21\uc740 \uacf5\uacf5 \uac74\uac15 \ubcf4\ud638\uc640 \uc644\ud654 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc548\ub0b4\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \uacbd\ub7c9 \uac00\ubc95 \ubaa8\ub378\uc778 Facebook Prophet (FBP)\uacfc NeuralProphet (NP)\uac00 \ubca0\uc774\uc9d5\uc758 PM$_{2.5}$ \ubc0f PM$_{10}$ \uc608\uce21\uc5d0\uc11c \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub3c4\uc2dc \ub300\uae30 \uc624\uc5fc \uc608\uce21\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc740 \uacf5\uacf5 \uac74\uac15\uc744 \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\uace0 \uc644\ud654 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc548\ub0b4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub2e4\ub144\uac04\uc758 \uc624\uc5fc\ubb3c \ubc0f \uae30\uc0c1 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4, \uc0c1\ud638 \uc815\ubcf4, mRMR\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \ud2b9\uc131 \uc120\ud0dd\uacfc \uc720\ucd9c \ubc29\uc9c0 \uc548\uc804 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1 \ubc0f \uc2dc\uac04 \uc21c\uc11c\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\ud560\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "FBP\uac00 NP, SARIMAX \ubc0f \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc18 \uae30\uc900\uc120\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \ub450 \uc624\uc5fc\ubb3c \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 test $R^2$\uac00 0.94 \uc774\uc0c1\uc774\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uac00\ubc95 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uacfc \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd \ubaa8\ub450\uc640 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uc815\ud655\uc131, \ud22c\uba85\uc131 \ubc0f \ubc30\uce58 \uc6a9\uc774\uc131\uc758 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc815\ud655\ud55c \ub3c4\uc2dc \ub300\uae30 \uc624\uc5fc \uc608\uce21\uc740 \uacf5\uacf5 \uac74\uac15\uc744 \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\uace0 \uc644\ud654 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc548\ub0b4\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd(DL)\uacfc \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc774 \ucd5c\uadfc \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \ud750\ub984\uc744 \uc9c0\ubc30\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub4e4\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uacfc \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc740 \uc6b4\uc601\uc801 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \uc800\ud574\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uacbd\ub7c9 \uac00\ubc95 \ubaa8\ub378\uc778 Facebook Prophet (FBP)\uacfc NeuralProphet (NP)\uac00 \uc911\uad6d \ubca0\uc774\uc9d5\uc758 \ubbf8\uc138\uba3c\uc9c0(PM$_{2.5}$, PM$_{10}$)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub2e4\ub144\uac04\uc758 \uc624\uc5fc\ubb3c\uc9c8 \ubc0f \uae30\uc0c1 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \ud2b9\uc131 \uc120\ud0dd(\uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4, \uc0c1\ud638 \uc815\ubcf4, mRMR), \uc720\ucd9c \ubc29\uc9c0 \uc548\uc804 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1, \ubc0f \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\ud560\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ub450 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc624\uc5fc\ubb3c \ubc0f \uc804\uad6c\uccb4 \ud68c\uadc0 \ubcc0\uc218\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, NP\ub294 \ucd94\uac00\ub85c \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ucc38\uace0\ub85c, \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\uc900\uc120(LSTM, LightGBM)\uacfc \ud558\ub098\uc758 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801 \ud1b5\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378(SARIMAX)\ub3c4 \uad6c\ud604\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc131\ub2a5\uc740 MAE, RMSE, \ubc0f $R^2$\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec 7\uc77c \ubcf4\uc874 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 FBP\uac00 NP, SARIMAX \ubc0f \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc18 \uae30\uc900\uc120\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b0\uc218\ud558\uba70, \ub450 \uc624\uc5fc\ubb3c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uac80\uc99d\ub41c $R^2$\uac00 0.94 \uc774\uc0c1\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc1c\uacac\uc740 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uac00\ubc95 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uacfc \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd \ubaa8\ub450\uc640 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uc815\ud655\uc131, \ud22c\uba85\uc131, \ubc0f \ubc30\uce58 \uc6a9\uc774\uc131\uc758 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

We present a unified framework for certified robust attribution that extends from convex models to deep networks. For convex settings, we derive Wasserstein-Robust Influence Functions (W-RIF) with provable coverage guarantees. For deep networks, we demonstrate that Euclidean certification is rendered vacuous by spectral amplification -- a mechanism where the inherent ill-conditioning of deep representations inflates Lipschitz bounds by over $10{,}000\\times$. This explains why standard TRAK scores, while accurate point estimates, are geometrically fragile: naive Euclidean robustness analysis yields 0\\% certification. Our key contribution is the Natural Wasserstein metric, which measures perturbations in the geometry induced by the model's own feature covariance. This eliminates spectral amplification, reducing worst-case sensitivity by $76\\times$ and stabilizing attribution estimates. On CIFAR-10 with ResNet-18, Natural W-TRAK certifies 68.7\\% of ranking pairs compared to 0\\% for Euclidean baselines -- to our knowledge, the first non-vacuous certified bounds for neural network attribution. Furthermore, we prove that the Self-Influence term arising from our analysis equals the Lipschitz constant governing attribution stability, providing theoretical grounding for leverage-based anomaly detection. Empirically, Self-Influence achieves 0.970 AUROC for label noise detection, identifying 94.1\\% of corrupted labels by examining just the top 20\\% of training data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc608\uce21\uc758 \uc6d0\uc778 \uad50\uc721 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uadc0\uc18d \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ubd84\ud3ec \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \ubbfc\uac10\ud574 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \uc800\ud574\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uac15\uc778\ud558\uac8c \uc778\uc99d\ub41c \uadc0\uc18d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub370\uc774\ud130 \uadc0\uc18d \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "Convex \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c Wasserstein-Robust Influence Functions(W-RIF)\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uace0, \ub525 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c Natural Wasserstein \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubcc0\uc774\uc131\uc744 \uce21\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "CIFAR-10 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c Natural W-TRAK\ub294 68.7%\uc758 \uc21c\uc704 \uc30d\uc744 \uc778\uc99d\ud558\uba70, Euclidean \uae30\uc900\uc758 0%\uc640 \ube44\uad50\ub41c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Self-Influence \ud56d\uc740 \uadc0\uc18d \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \uc9c0\ubc30\ud558\ub294 Lipschitz \uc0c1\uc218\uc640 \uac19\uc73c\uba70, \ub808\ubc84\ub9ac\uc9c0 \uae30\ubc18 \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uae30\ubc18\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub370\uc774\ud130 \uadc0\uc18d \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0 \ucc45\uc784\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc608\uc81c\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubd84\ud3ec\uc801 perturbation\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubbfc\uac10\uc131\uc774 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \uc800\ud574\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubcfc\ub85d \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \ub525 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uae4c\uc9c0 \ud655\uc7a5\ub418\ub294 \uc778\uc99d\ub41c \uac15\uc778\ud55c \uadc0\uc18d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcfc\ub85d \uc124\uc815\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uc99d\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ucee4\ubc84\ub9ac\uc9c0 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 Wasserstein-Robust Influence Functions (W-RIF)\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub525 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uc720\ud074\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc778\uc99d\uc774 \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7f4 \uc99d\ud3ed\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ubb34\uc758\ubbf8\ud574\uc9c4\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uae4a\uc740 \ud45c\ud604\uc758 \uace0\uc720\ud55c \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc774 Lipschitz \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c $10{,}000\times$ \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0a4\uc6b4\ub2e4\ub294 \ub4f1\uc7a5 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ud45c\uc900 TRAK \uc810\uc218\uac00 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc810 \ucd94\uc815\uce58\uc77c\uc9c0\ub77c\ub3c4 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucde8\uc57d\ud55c \uc774\uc720\ub97c \uc124\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \uae30\uc5ec\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc790\uccb4 \ud2b9\uc9d5 \uacf5\ubd84\uc0b0\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc720\ub3c4\ub41c \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 perturbations\ub97c \uce21\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc790\uc5f0 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7f4 \uc99d\ud3ed\uc744 \uc81c\uac70\ud558\uc5ec \ucd5c\uc545\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0 \ubbfc\uac10\uc131\uc744 $76\times$ \uc904\uc774\uace0, \uadc0\uc18d \ucd94\uc815\uce58\ub97c \uc548\uc815\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Dixon"], "title": "Goal inference with Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filters", "comment": "9 pages, 2 figures", "summary": "Inferring the eventual goal of a mobile agent from noisy observations of its trajectory is a fundamental estimation problem. We initiate the study of such intent inference using a variant of a Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter (RBPF), subject to the assumption that the agent's intent manifests through closed-loop behavior with a state-of-the-art provable practical stability property. Leveraging the assumed closed-form agent dynamics, the RBPF analytically marginalizes the linear-Gaussian substructure and updates particle weights only, improving sample efficiency over a standard particle filter. Two difference estimators are introduced: a Gaussian mixture model using the RBPF weights and a reduced version confining the mixture to the effective sample. We quantify how well the adversary can recover the agent's intent using information-theoretic leakage metrics and provide computable lower bounds on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the true intent distribution and RBPF estimates via Gaussian-mixture KL bounds. We also provide a bound on the difference in performance between the two estimators, highlighting the fact that the reduced estimator performs almost as well as the complete one.

Recent research suggests that large language models (LLMs) encode rich semantic knowledge about the world, which can be valuable for guiding agents in high-level reasoning and planning across both embodied and purely textual settings. However, existing approaches often depend heavily on querying LLMs during training and inference, making them computationally expensive and difficult to deploy efficiently. In addition, these methods typically employ a pretrained, unaltered LLM whose parameters remain fixed throughout training, providing no opportunity for adaptation to the target task. To address these limitations, we introduce SCOPE (Subgoal-COnditioned Pretraining for Efficient planning), a one-shot hierarchical planner that leverages LLM-generated subgoals only at initialization to pretrain a lightweight student model. Unlike prior approaches that distill LLM knowledge by repeatedly prompting the model to adaptively generate subgoals during training, our method derives subgoals directly from example trajectories. This design removes the need for repeated LLM queries, significantly improving efficiency, though at the cost of reduced explainability and potentially suboptimal subgoals. Despite their suboptimality, our results on the TextCraft environment show that LLM-generated subgoals can still serve as a strong starting point for hierarchical goal decomposition in text-based planning tasks. Compared to the LLM-based hierarchical agent ADaPT (Prasad et al., 2024), which achieves a 0.52 success rate, our method reaches 0.56 and reduces inference time from 164.4 seconds to just 3.0

Consequently, distributed approaches, such as Federated Learning and Split Learning, have become essential paradigms for scalable deployment. However, existing Split Learning approaches assume client homogeneity and uniform split points across all participants. This critically limits their applicability to real-world IoT systems where devices exhibit heterogeneity in computational resources. To address this limitation, this paper proposes Hetero-SplitEE, a novel method that enables heterogeneous IoT devices to train a shared deep neural network in parallel collaboratively. By integrating heterogeneous early exits into hierarchical training, our approach allows each client to select distinct split points (cut layers) tailored to its computational capacity. In addition, we propose two cooperative training strategies, the Sequential strategy and the Averaging strategy, to facilitate this collaboration among clients with different split points. The Sequential strategy trains clients sequentially with a shared server model to reduce computational overhead. The Averaging strategy enables parallel client training with periodic cross-layer aggregation. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and STL-10 datasets using ResNet-18 demonstrate that our method maintains competitive accuracy while efficiently supporting diverse computational constraints, enabling practical deployment of collaborative deep learning in heterogeneous IoT ecosystems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Hetero-SplitEE\ub294 \uc774\uc885 IoT \uc7a5\uce58\ub4e4\uc774

However, existing MPI models face two major challenges. First, the scarcity of labeled molecule-protein pairs significantly limits model performance, as available datasets capture only a small fraction of biological relevant interactions. Second, most methods rely solely on molecular and protein features, ignoring broader biological context such as genes, metabolic pathways, and functional annotations that could provide essential complementary information. To address these limitations, our framework first aggregates diverse biological datasets, including molecular, protein, genes and pathway-level interactions, and then develop an optimal transport-based approach to generate high-quality pseudo-labels for unlabeled molecule-protein pairs, leveraging the underlying distribution of known interactions to guide label assignment. By treating pseudo-labeling as a mechanism for bridging disparate biological modalities, our approach enables the effective use of heterogeneous data to enhance MPI prediction. We evaluate our framework on multiple MPI datasets including virtual screening tasks and protein retrieval tasks, demonstrating substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracies and zero shot ability across unseen interactions. Beyond MPI prediction, our approach provides a new paradigm for leveraging diverse biological data sources to tackle problems traditionally constrained by single- or bi-modal learning, paving the way for future advances in computational biology and drug discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub2e8\ubc31\uc9c8-\ubd84\uc790 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9(MPI) \uc608\uce21\uc744

Accurate forecasting is hindered by the complex influence of external factors such as traffic accidents and regulations, often overlooked by existing models due to limited data integration. To address these limitations, we present two enriched traffic datasets from Tokyo and California, incorporating traffic accident and regulation data. Leveraging these datasets, we propose ConFormer (Conditional Transformer), a novel framework that integrates graph propagation with guided normalization layer. This design dynamically adjusts spatial and temporal node relationships based on historical patterns, enhancing predictive accuracy. Our model surpasses the state-of-the-art STAEFormer in both predictive performance and efficiency, achieving lower computational costs and reduced parameter demands. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that ConFormer consistently outperforms mainstream spatio-temporal baselines across multiple metrics, underscoring its potential to advance traffic prediction research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uad50\ud1b5 \uc608\uce21\uc740 \uc2ec\uce35 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uacf5\uac04-\uc2dc\uac04 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ub9c8\uc774\ub2dd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc8fc\uc694 \uacfc\uc81c\ub85c \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uad50\ud1b5 \uc0ac\uace0 \ubc0f \uaddc\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubaa8\ub378 ConFormer\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uc5ec \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uad50\ud1b5 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc678\ubd80 \uc694\uc778\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc798 \ubc18\uc601\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud568.", "method": "\uad50\ud1b5 \uc0ac\uace0 \ubc0f \uaddc\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc804\ud30c\uc640 \uac00\uc774\ub4dc\ub41c \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \uacc4\uce35\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378 ConFormer\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud568.", "result": "ConFormer\ub294 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uac00\uc7a5 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \ubaa8\ub378\uc778 STAEFormer\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc608\uce21 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90c.", "conclusion": "ConFormer\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub9e4\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc8fc\ub958 \uacf5\uac04-\uc2dc\uac04 \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc744 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\uba70 \uad50\ud1b5 \uc608\uce21 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud568.", "translated_summary": "\uad50\ud1b5 \uc608\uce21\uc740 \uc2ec\uce35 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \uacf5\uac04-\uc2dc\uac04 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ub9c8\uc774\ub2dd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc8fc\uc694 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub85c \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc608\uce21\uc740 \uad50\ud1b5 \uc0ac\uace0 \ubc0f \uaddc\uc81c\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc678\ubd80 \uc694\uc778\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubc1b\ub294\ub370, \uc774\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud1b5\ud569\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uac04\uacfc\ub418\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub3c4\ucfc4\uc640 \uce98\ub9ac\ud3ec\ub2c8\uc544\uc758 \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \uad50\ud1b5 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \uc774 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\ub294 \uad50\ud1b5 \uc0ac\uace0 \ubc0f \uaddc\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \ud3ec\ud568\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc804\ud30c\uc640 \uac00\uc774\ub4dc\ub41c \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \uacc4\uce35\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 ConFormer(Conditional Transformer)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc124\uacc4\ub294 \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801 \ud328\ud134\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uc5ec \uacf5\uac04 \ubc0f \uc2dc\uac04 \ub178\ub4dc \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc608\uce21 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 STAEFormer\ub97c \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\uba70, \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \ub0ae\ucd94\uace0 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \uc694\uad6c\ub97c \uc904\uc774\ub294 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 ConFormer\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub9e4\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc8fc\ub958 \uacf5\uac04-\uc2dc\uac04 \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc744 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\uba70, \uad50\ud1b5 \uc608\uce21 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ubc1c\uc804\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, progress in sleep foundation models is hindered by two key limitations: (1) the lack of a shared dataset and benchmark with diverse tasks for training and evaluation, and (2) the absence of a systematic evaluation of SSRL approaches across sleep-related tasks. To address these gaps, we introduce Stanford Sleep Bench, a large-scale PSG dataset comprising 17,467 recordings totaling over 163,000 hours from a major sleep clinic, including 13 clinical disease prediction tasks alongside canonical sleep-related tasks such as sleep staging, apnea diagnosis, and age estimation. We systematically evaluate SSRL pre-training methods on Stanford Sleep Bench, assessing downstream performance across four tasks: sleep staging, apnea diagnosis, age estimation, and disease and mortality prediction. Our results show that multiple pretraining methods achieve comparable performance for sleep staging, apnea diagnosis, and age estimation. However, for mortality and disease prediction, contrastive learning significantly outperforms other approaches while also converging faster during pretraining. To facilitate reproducibility and advance sleep research, we will release Stanford Sleep Bench along with pretrained model weights, training pipelines, and evaluation code.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774

Focusing on highway scenarios, this paper proposes a Tripartite Cooperative Semantic Communication (TCSC) framework, which enables Vehicle Users (VUs) to perform semantic task offloading via Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) and Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications. Considering task latency and the number of semantic symbols, the framework constructs a Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) problem, which is transformed into two subproblems. First, we innovatively propose a multi-agent proximal policy optimization task offloading optimization method based on parametric distribution noise (MAPPO-PDN) to solve the optimization problem of the number of semantic symbols; second, linear programming (LP) is used to solve offloading ratio.

However, existing agents are typically confined to static, predefined action spaces--such as exclusively using APIs, GUI events, or robotic commands. This rigidity limits their adaptability in dynamic environments where the optimal granularity of interaction varies contextually. To bridge this gap, we propose CrossAgent, a unified agentic model that masters heterogeneous action spaces and autonomously selects the most effective interface for each step of a trajectory. We introduce a comprehensive training pipeline that integrates cold-start supervised fine-tuning with a Multi-Turn Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm. This approach enables the agent to learn adaptive action switching--balancing high-level efficiency with low-level precision--without human-specified rules. Extensive experiments on over 800 tasks in the open-world Minecraft environment demonstrate that CrossAgent achieves state-of-the-art performance.

However, such architectures incur substantial computational costs, resulting in high deployment overhead, and existing methods exhibit limited cross-task generalization, necessitating training from scratch for each new task. To this end, we propose \\textbf{DivMorph}, a modular training paradigm that leverages knowledge diversion to learn decomposable controllers. DivMorph factorizes randomly initialized Transformer weights into factor units via SVD prior to training and employs dynamic soft gating to modulate these units based on task and morphology embeddings, separating them into shared \\textit{learngenes} and morphology- and task-specific \\textit{tailors}, thereby achieving knowledge disentanglement. By selectively activating relevant components, DivMorph enables scalable and efficient policy deployment while supporting effective policy transfer to novel tasks.

In this paper, we propose STACHE, a comprehensive framework for generating local, black-box explanations for an agent's specific action within discrete Markov games. Our method produces a Composite Explanation consisting of two complementary components: (1) a Robustness Region, the connected neighborhood of states where the agent's action remains invariant, and (2) Minimal Counterfactuals, the smallest state perturbations required to alter that decision. By exploiting the structure of factored state spaces, we introduce an exact, search-based algorithm that circumvents the fidelity gaps of surrogate models. Empirical validation on Gymnasium environments demonstrates that our framework not only explains policy actions, but also effectively captures the evolution of policy logic during training - from erratic, unstable behavior to optimized, robust strategies - providing actionable insights into agent sensitivity and decision boundaries.", "AI": {"tldr": "STACHE\ub294 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc885\ud569 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud76c\uc18c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ub610\ub294 \uc548\uc804\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc608\uae30\uce58 \uc54a\uc740 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub514\ubc84\uae45 \ubc0f \uac80\uc99d \ub3c4\uad6c\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "STACHE\ub294 \uc774\uc0b0 \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uac8c\uc784 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud2b9\uc815 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc801 \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uac15\uac74\uc131 \uc601\uc5ed\uacfc \ucd5c\uc18c \ubc18\uc0ac\uc2e4\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ubcf5\ud569 \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "Empirical validation on Gymnasium environments shows that our framework explains policy actions and captures the evolution of policy logic during training.", "conclusion": "STACHE\ub294 \ubd88\uc548\uc815\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub41c \uc804\ub7b5\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \uc2dc\uac01\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\ud574\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\uba70, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ubbfc\uac10\ub3c4\uc640 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc885\uc885 \ud76c\uc18c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ub610\ub294 \uc548\uc804\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc608\uae30\uce58 \uc54a\uac8c \ud589\ub3d9\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub514\ubc84\uae45 \ubc0f \uac80\uc99d \ub3c4\uad6c\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \ud07d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774\uc0b0 \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uac8c\uc784 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud2b9\uc815 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc801, \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc885\ud569 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 STACHE\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc774 \ubd88\ubcc0\uc778 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc758 \uc5f0\uacb0\ub41c \uc774\uc6c3\uc778 \uac15\uac74\uc131 \uc601\uc5ed(1)\uacfc \ud574\ub2f9 \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ubcc0\uacbd\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ucd5c\uc18c\ud55c\uc758 \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc12d\ub3d9\uc778 \ucd5c\uc18c \ubc18\uc0ac\uc2e4(2)\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \ubcf5\ud569 \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubd84\ud574\ub41c \uc0c1\ud0dc \uacf5\uac04\uc758 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub300\uccb4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud53c\ud558\ub294 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uac80\uc0c9 \uae30\ubc18 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.
