However, existing safety evaluations largely focus on language-model-level content compliance or abstract agent settings, failing to capture execution-grounded risks arising from real operational workflows and state-changing actions. To bridge this gap, we propose FinVault, the first execution-grounded security benchmark for financial agents, comprising 31 regulatory case-driven sandbox scenarios with state-writable databases and explicit compliance constraints, together with 107 real-world vulnerabilities and 963 test cases that systematically cover prompt injection, jailbreaking, financially adapted attacks, as well as benign inputs for false-positive evaluation. Experimental results reveal that existing defense mechanisms remain ineffective in realistic financial agent settings, with average attack success rates (ASR) still reaching up to 50.0\\% on state-of-the-art models and remaining non-negligible even for the most robust systems (ASR 6.7\\%), highlighting the limited transferability of current safety designs and the need for stronger financial-specific defenses.

Benchmark and evaluation framework for agentic AI in identity security posture management, including expert evaluation and LLM-as-judge analysis", "summary": "Identity Security Posture Management (ISPM) is a core challenge for modern enterprises operating across cloud and SaaS environments. Answering basic ISPM visibility questions, such as understanding identity inventory and configuration hygiene, requires interpreting complex identity data, motivating growing interest in agentic AI systems. Despite this interest, there is currently no standardized way to evaluate how well such systems perform ISPM visibility tasks on real enterprise data. We introduce the Sola Visibility ISPM Benchmark, the first benchmark designed to evaluate agentic AI systems on foundational ISPM visibility tasks using a live, production-grade identity environment spanning AWS, Okta, and Google Workspace. The benchmark focuses on identity inventory and hygiene questions and is accompanied by the Sola AI Agent, a tool-using agent that translates natural-language queries into executable data exploration steps and produces verifiable, evidence-backed answers. Across 77 benchmark questions, the agent achieves strong overall performance, with an expert accuracy of 0.84 and a strict success rate of 0.77. Performance is highest on AWS hygiene tasks, where expert accuracy reaches 0.94, while results on Google Workspace and Okta hygiene tasks are more moderate, yet competitive.

In this paper, we identify emoticon semantic confusion, a vulnerability where LLMs misinterpret ASCII-based emoticons to perform unintended and even destructive actions. To systematically study this phenomenon, we develop an automated data generation pipeline and construct a dataset containing 3,757 code-oriented test cases spanning 21 meta-scenarios, four programming languages, and varying contextual complexities. Our study on six LLMs reveals that emoticon semantic confusion is pervasive, with an average confusion ratio exceeding 38%. More critically, over 90% of confused responses yield 'silent failures', which are syntactically valid outputs but deviate from user intent, potentially leading to destructive security consequences. Furthermore, we observe that this vulnerability readily transfers to popular agent frameworks, while existing prompt-based mitigations remain largely ineffective. We call on the community to recognize this emerging vulnerability and develop effective mitigation methods to uphold the safety and reliability of the LLM system.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774

Developing a new multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach, adversaries craft stealthy, strategically timed, wear-out attacks designed to subtly degrade product quality and reduce the lifespan of field actuators. This sophisticated method leverages DRL methodology not only to execute precise and detrimental impacts on targeted infrastructure but also to evade detection by contemporary AI-driven defence systems. By developing and implementing tailored policies, the attackers ensure their hostile actions blend seamlessly with normal operational patterns, circumventing integrated security measures. Our research reveals the robustness of this attack strategy, shedding light on the potential for DRL models to be manipulated for adversarial purposes.

However, conventional estimated time of arrival (ETA) models are primarily designed for the immediate next port of call and rely heavily on real-time automatic identification system (AIS) data, which is inherently unavailable for future voyage segments. To address this gap, the study reformulates future-port ETA prediction as a segment-level time-series forecasting problem. We develop a transformer-based architecture that integrates historical sailing durations, destination port congestion proxies, and static vessel descriptors. The proposed framework employs a causally masked attention mechanism to capture long-range temporal dependencies and a multi-task learning head to jointly predict segment sailing durations and port congestion states, leveraging shared latent signals to mitigate high uncertainty. Evaluation on a real-world global dataset from 2021 demonstrates the proposed model consistently outperforms a comprehensive suite of competitive baselines. The result shows a relative reduction of 4.85% in mean absolute error (MAE) and 4.95% in mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) compared with sequence baseline models. The relative reductions with gradient boosting machines are 9.39% in MAE and 52.97% in MAPE.

Code available at https://github.com/Govcraft/latin-experiment", "summary": "Current multi-agent LLM frameworks rely on explicit orchestration patterns borrowed from human organizational structures: planners delegate to executors, managers coordinate workers, and hierarchical control flow governs agent interactions. These approaches suffer from coordination overhead that scales poorly with agent count and task complexity. We propose a fundamentally different paradigm inspired by natural coordination mechanisms: agents operate locally on a shared artifact, guided only by pressure gradients derived from measurable quality signals, with temporal decay preventing premature convergence. We formalize this as optimization over a pressure landscape and prove convergence guarantees under mild conditions.\n  Empirically, on Latin Square constraint satisfaction across 1,078 trials, pressure-field coordination matches hierarchical control (38.2% vs 38.8% aggregate solve rate, p=0.94, indicating statistical equivalence). Both significantly outperform sequential (23.3%), random (11.7%), and conversation-based multi-agent dialogue (8.6%, p<0.00001). Temporal decay is essential: disabling it increases final pressure 49-fold (d=4.15). On easy problems, pressure-field achieves 87% solve rate. The approach maintains consistent performance from 2 to 32 agents. Our key finding: implicit coordination through shared pressure gradients achieves parity with explicit hierarchical control while dramatically outperforming explicit dialogue-based coordination. This suggests that constraint-driven emergence offers a simpler, equally effective foundation for multi-agent AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc555\ub825 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30\uc5d0

We argue that EO represents a paradigm shift: a transition from algorithmic behavior programming to semantic world modeling, where agent behavior emerges naturally from declarative domain rules rather than being explicitly coded. Using a survival game scenario (Winter Feast), we demonstrate how EO achieves prioritybased task interruption through dataflow conditions rather than explicit preemption logic. Comparison with Behavior Trees (BT) and Goal-Oriented Action Planning (GOAP) reveals that while these approaches model what agents should do, EO models when actions become possible - a fundamental difference that addresses the semantic-process gap in game AI architecture. We discuss integration strategies, debugging advantages inherent to temporal event graphs, and the potential for LLM-driven runtime model generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uac8c\uc784 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4 Executable Ontologies (EO)\uc758 \uc801\uc6a9\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8e8\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uac8c\uc784 AI \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8\uc801-\ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \uac04\uc758 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c EO\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "Winter Feast\ub77c\ub294 \uc0dd\uc874 \uac8c\uc784 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec EO\uac00 \uc6b0\uc120\uc21c\uc704 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc911\ub2e8\uc744 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud750\ub984 \uc870\uac74\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2ec\uc131\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "result": "EO\uac00 \ud589\ub3d9 \ud2b8\ub9ac(BT) \ubc0f \ubaa9\ud45c \uc9c0\ud5a5 \ud589\ub3d9 \uacc4\ud68d(GOAP)\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud588\uc744 \ub54c, \uc5b8\uc81c \ub3d9\uc791\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c\uc9c0\ub97c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uba70 \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \ucc98\ub9ac\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud568\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 EO\uc758 \ud1b5\ud569 \uc804\ub7b5\uacfc \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc758 \ub514\ubc84\uae45 \uc7a5\uc810, LLM \uc8fc\ub3c4 \ub7f0\ud0c0\uc784 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc0dd\uc131\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \ub17c\uc758\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub300\ub2f4\ud55c \ubc14\ub2e4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uad6c\ud604\ub41c Executable Ontologies (EO)\uac00 \uac8c\uc784 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc801\uc6a9\ub418\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 EO\uac00 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d\uc5d0\uc11c \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc801 \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784 \uc804\ud658\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b8\ub2e4\uace0 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5ec\uae30\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud589\ub3d9\uc740 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucf54\ub529\ub418\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uc120\uc5b8\uc801 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uaddc\uce59\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7fd\uac8c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc0dd\uc874 \uac8c\uc784 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc778 Winter Feast\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec EO\uac00 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801 \uc120\uc810 \ub17c\ub9ac \ub300\uc2e0 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud750\ub984 \uc870\uac74\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc6b0\uc120\uc21c\uc704 \uae30\ubc18 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc911\ub2e8\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud589\ub3d9 \ud2b8\ub9ac(BT)\uc640 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc9c0\ud5a5 \ud589\ub3d9 \uacc4\ud68d(GOAP)\uacfc\uc758 \ube44\uad50\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ubb34\uc5c7\uc744 \ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \ubc18\uba74, EO\ub294 \ud589\ub3d9\uc774 \uc5b8\uc81c \uac00\ub2a5\ud574\uc9c0\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b4\uba70 \uc774\ub294 \uac8c\uc784 AI \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8\uc801-\uacfc\uc815 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569 \uc804\ub7b5, \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc5d0 \ub0b4\uc7ac\ub41c \ub514\ubc84\uae45 \uc7a5\uc810 \ubc0f LLM \uc8fc\ub3c4 \ub7f0\ud0c0\uc784 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc0dd\uc131\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub17c\uc758\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, the reliability of these detectors remains fragile against adversarial evasions. Existing attack strategies often rely on white-box assumptions or demand prohibitively high computational and interaction costs, rendering them ineffective under practical black-box scenarios. In this paper, we propose Multi-stage Alignment for Style Humanization (MASH), a novel framework that evades black-box detectors based on style transfer. MASH sequentially employs style-injection supervised fine-tuning, direct preference optimization, and inference-time refinement to shape the distributions of AI-generated texts to resemble those of human-written texts. Experiments across 6 datasets and 5 detectors demonstrate the superior performance of MASH over 11 baseline evaders.

To address this challenge, we construct structure-preserving metrics that are geodesically complete while ensuring that every stationary point under the new metric remains stationary under the original one. Building on this foundation, we revisit the classical symmetric two-point zeroth-order estimator and analyze its mean-squared error from a purely intrinsic perspective, depending only on the manifold's geometry rather than any ambient embedding. Leveraging this intrinsic analysis, we establish convergence guarantees for stochastic gradient descent with this intrinsic estimator. Under additional suitable conditions, an $\u03b5$-stationary point under the constructed metric $g'$ also corresponds to an $\u03b5$-stationary point under the original metric $g$, thereby matching the best-known complexity in the geodesically complete setting. Empirical studies on synthetic problems confirm our theoretical findings, and experiments on a practical mesh optimization task demonstrate that our framework maintains stable convergence even in the absence of geodesic completeness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd88\uc644\uc804\ud55c \ub9ac\ub9cc \uacc4\ub7c9\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\uc801 \uc810\uc744 \uadfc\uc0ac\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub9ac\ub9cc \uacc4\ub7c9\uc774 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd88\uc644\uc804\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc815\uc801 \uc810 \uadfc\uc0ac\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uad6c\uc870 \ubcf4\uc874 \uacc4\ub7c9\uc744 \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc644\uc804\ud55c \uacc4\ub7c9\uc744 \ub9cc\ub4e4\uace0, \uae30\uc874 \uacc4\ub7c9 \uc544\ub798\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\uc801 \uc810\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub0b4\ubd80 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \uace0\uc804\uc801\uc778 \ub450 \uc810 \uc81c\ub85c \ucc28\uc218 \ucd94\uc815\uae30\uc758 \ud3c9\uade0 \uc81c\uacf1 \uc624\ucc28\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0, \ub0b4\uc7ac\uc801 \ucd94\uc815\uae30\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uacbd\ub7c9 \ud558\uac15\ubc95\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc218\ub834 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uc124\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uad6c\uc131\ub41c \uacc4\ub7c9 \uc544\ub798\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \u03b5-\uc815\uc801 \uc810\uc740 \uc6d0\ub798 \uacc4\ub7c9 \uc544\ub798\uc758 \u03b5-\uc815\uc801 \uc810\uc5d0 \ub300\uc751\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc778\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uae30\ubcf8 \ub9ac\ub9cc \uacc4\ub7c9 $g$\uac00 \uae30\ud558\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd88\uc644\uc804\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ub9ac\ub9cc \uc81c\ub85c \ucc28\uc218 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uba70, \ubd88\uc644\uc804\ud55c \uacc4\ub7c9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc815\uc801 \uc810\uc744 \uadfc\uc0ac\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804\uc5d0 \ub300\uc751\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uae30\ud558\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc644\uc804\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacc4\ub7c9 \uc544\ub798\uc758 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc815\uc801 \uc810\uc774 \uc6d0\ub798 \uacc4\ub7c9 \uc544\ub798\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc815\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\uc9c0\ub418\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \uad6c\uc870 \ubcf4\uc874 \uacc4\ub7c9\uc744 \uad6c\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uace0\uc804\uc801\uc778 \ub300\uce6d \ub450 \uc810 \uc81c\ub85c \ucc28\uc218 \ucd94\uc815\uae30\ub97c \uc7ac\uc870\uba85\ud558\uace0, \ub9e4\ub2c8\ud3f4\ub4dc\uc758 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc5d0\ub9cc \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \uc21c\uc218\ud55c \ub0b4\uc7ac\uc801 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uade0 \uc81c\uacf1 \uc624\ucc28\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub0b4\uc7ac\uc801 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \ub0b4\uc7ac\uc801 \ucd94\uc815\uae30\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uacbd\ub7c9 \ud558\uac15\ubc95\uc758 \uc218\ub834 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \ud655\ub9bd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd94\uac00\uc801\uc778 \uc801\uc808\ud55c \uc870\uac74 \ud558\uc5d0, \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \uacc4\ub7c9 $g'$ \uc544\ub798\uc758 \u03b5-\uc815\uc801 \uc810\uc740 \uc6d0\ub798 \uacc4\ub7c9 $g$ \uc544\ub798\uc758 \u03b5-\uc815\uc801 \uc810\uc5d0 \ud574\ub2f9\ud558\ubbc0\ub85c, \uae30\ud558\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc644\uc804\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uac00\uc7a5 \uc798 \uc54c\ub824\uc9c4 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ub3c4\uc5d0 \uc77c\uce58\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud569\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud558\uba70, \uc2e4\uc81c \uba54\uc26c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc740 \uae30\ud558\uc801 \uc644\uc804\uc131\uc774 \uc5c6\ub354\ub77c\ub3c4 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc218\ub834\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

To reduce the dominant prefill cost in such pipelines, recent work advocates KV cache reuse across partially shared contexts and reports substantial speedups for generation agents. In this work, we show that these efficiency gains do not transfer uniformly to judge-centric inference. Across GSM8K, MMLU, and HumanEval, we find that reuse strategies that are effective for execution agents can severely perturb judge behavior: end-task accuracy may appear stable, yet the judge's selection becomes highly inconsistent with dense prefill. We quantify this risk using Judge Consistency Rate (JCR) and provide diagnostics showing that reuse systematically weakens cross-candidate attention, especially for later candidate blocks. Our ablation further demonstrates that explicit cross-candidate interaction is crucial for preserving dense-prefill decisions. Overall, our results identify a previously overlooked failure mode of KV cache reuse and highlight judge-centric inference as a distinct regime that demands dedicated, risk-aware system design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ud6c4\ubcf4 \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 LLM \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c KV \uce90\uc2dc \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9\uc774 \ud3c9\uac00\uc790 \uc911\uc2ec \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694\ud55c \ub9ac\uc18c\uc2a4 \ube44\uc6a9\uc778 \uc0ac\uc804 \ucc44\uc6b0\uae30 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574 KV \uce90\uc2dc \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "GSM8K, MMLU, HumanEval\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9 \uc804\ub7b5\uc774 \ud3c9\uac00\uc790 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9 \uc804\ub7b5\uc774 \ud3c9\uac00\uc790\uac00 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 \uc783\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4e4 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uc600\uace0, \ud3c9\uac00\uc790\uc758 \uc120\ud0dd\uc774 \ubc00\ub3c4 \ub192\uc740 \uc0ac\uc804 \ucc44\uc6b0\uae30\uc5d0\uc11c \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ubd88\uc548\uc815\ud574\uc9c8 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubc1d\ud614\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "KV \uce90\uc2dc \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9\uc758 \uc2e4\ud328 \ubaa8\ub4dc\ub97c \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uace0, \ud3c9\uac00\uc790 \uc911\uc2ec \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc704\ud5d8 \uc778\uc2dd\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc124\uacc4\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud568\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 LLM \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c LLM \ud3c9\uac00\uc790\uac00 \uc9d1\uacc4\ud558\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ud6c4\ubcf4 \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c0\ubc30\uc801\uc778 \uc0ac\uc804 \ucc44\uc6b0\uae30 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \ucd5c\uadfc \uc791\uc5c5\uc740 \ubd80\ubd84\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uacf5\uc720\ub41c \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c KV \uce90\uc2dc \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \uad8c\uc7a5\ud558\uace0 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc18d\ub3c4 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ubcf4\uace0\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc774 \ud3c9\uac00\uc790 \uc911\uc2ec \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0 \uace0\ub974\uac8c \uc804\uc774\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.

The first question is how to enable a model to recognize that it does not know. A promising approach is to use confidence, computed from the model's internal signals, to reflect its ignorance. Prior work in specific domains has shown that calibration can provide reliable confidence estimates. In this work, we propose a simple, effective, and universal training-free method that applies to both vision and language models, performing model calibration, cascading, and data cleaning to better exploit a model's ability to recognize when it does not know. We first highlight two key empirical observations: higher confidence corresponds to higher accuracy within a single model, and models calibrated on the validation set remain calibrated on a held-out test set. These findings empirically establish the reliability and comparability of calibrated confidence. Building on this, we introduce two applications: (1) model cascading with calibrated advantage routing and (2) data cleaning based on model ensemble. Using the routing signal derived from the comparability of calibrated confidences, we cascade large and small models to improve efficiency with almost no compromise in accuracy, and we further cascade two models of comparable scale to achieve performance beyond either model alone. Leveraging multiple experts and their calibrated confidences, we design a simple yet effective data-cleaning method that balances precision and detection rate to identify mislabeled samples in ImageNet and Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) datasets. Our results demonstrate that enabling models to recognize when they do not know is a practical step toward more efficient, reliable, and trustworthy AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubaa8\ub378\uc774

Existing goal-conditioned and hierarchical offline RL methods decompose such tasks and generate intermediate rewards to mitigate limitations of traditional offline RL, but usually overlook temporal dependencies among subgoals and rely on imprecise reward shaping, leading to suboptimal policies. To address these issues, we propose STO-RL (Offline RL using LLM-Guided Subgoal Temporal Order), an offline RL framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate temporally ordered subgoal sequences and corresponding state-to-subgoal-stage mappings. Using this temporal structure, STO-RL applies potential-based reward shaping to transform sparse terminal rewards into dense, temporally consistent signals, promoting subgoal progress while avoiding suboptimal solutions. The resulting augmented dataset with shaped rewards enables efficient offline training of high-performing policies. Evaluations on four discrete and continuous sparse-reward benchmarks demonstrate that STO-RL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art offline goal-conditioned and hierarchical RL baselines, achieving faster convergence, higher success rates, and shorter trajectories. Ablation studies further confirm STO-RL's robustness to imperfect or noisy LLM-generated subgoal sequences, demonstrating that LLM-guided subgoal temporal structures combined with theoretically grounded reward shaping provide a practical and scalable solution for long-horizon offline RL.", "AI": {"tldr": "STO-RL\uc740 LLM\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc2dc\uac04 \uc21c\uc11c\uac00

Modern agent protocols standardize connectivity and interoperability; yet, none provide formal, resource governance-normative mechanisms to bound how much agents may consume or how long they may operate. We introduce Agent Contracts, a formal framework that extends the contract metaphor from task allocation to resource-bounded execution. An Agent Contract unifies input/output specifications, multi-dimensional resource constraints, temporal boundaries, and success criteria into a coherent governance mechanism with explicit lifecycle semantics. For multi-agent coordination, we establish conservation laws ensuring delegated budgets respect parent constraints, enabling hierarchical coordination through contract delegation. Empirical validation across four experiments demonstrates 90% token reduction with 525x lower variance in iterative workflows, zero conservation violations in multi-agent delegation, and measurable quality-resource tradeoffs through contract modes. Agent Contracts provide formal foundations for predictable, auditable, and resource-bounded autonomous AI deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 Agent Contracts\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud615\uc2dd\uc758 \uacc4\uc57d \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc790\uc6d0 \uad00\ub9ac \ubc0f \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud611\uc5c5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uacc4\uc57d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \uc870\uc815\uc740 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc790\uc6d0 \uc18c\ube44\uc640 \uc6b4\uc601 \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud615\uc2dd\uc801 \uaddc\uc81c\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "Agent Contracts \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc785\ub825/\ucd9c\ub825 \uc0ac\uc591, \ub2e4\ucc28\uc6d0 \uc790\uc6d0 \uc81c\uc57d, \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \uacbd\uacc4 \ubc0f \uc131\uacf5 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc790\uc6d0\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud558\ub294 \uc2e4\ud589\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "4\uac00\uc9c0 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 90%\uc758 \ud1a0\ud070 \uac10\uc18c \ubc0f 525\ubc30 \ub0ae\uc740 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud588\uc73c\uba70, \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc704\uc784\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf4\uc874 \uc704\ubc18\uc774 \uc5c6\uc74c\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Agent Contracts\ub294 \uc790\uc6d0\uc5d0 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc790\uc728 AI \ubc30\ud3ec\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc608\uce21 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uac10\uc0ac \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud615\uc2dd\uc801 \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uacc4\uc57d \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c(1980)\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uacc4\uc57d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \uc870\uc815\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ud604\ub300 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc740 \uc5f0\uacb0\uc131\uacfc \uc0c1\ud638 \uc6b4\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \ud45c\uc900\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc18c\ube44\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc591\uc774\ub098 \uc6b4\uc601 \uae30\uac04\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud558\ub294 \ud615\uc2dd\uc801 \uc790\uc6d0 \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4 \uaddc\ubc94\uc801 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc740 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud560\ub2f9\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uc6d0 \uc81c\ud55c \uc2e4\ud589\uc73c\ub85c \uacc4\uc57d \uc740\uc720\ub97c \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \ud615\uc2dd\uc801 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uacc4\uc57d(Agent Contracts)\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uacc4\uc57d\uc740 \uc785\ub825/\ucd9c\ub825 \uc0ac\uc591, \ub2e4\ucc28\uc6d0 \uc790\uc6d0 \uc81c\uc57d, \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \uacbd\uacc4 \ubc0f \uc131\uacf5 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801 \uc0dd\uc560 \uc8fc\uae30 \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc73c\ub85c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc704\uc784\ub41c \uc608\uc0b0\uc774 \ubd80\ubaa8 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \uc900\uc218\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \ubcf4\uc874 \ubc95\uce59\uc744 \uc218\ub9bd\ud558\uc5ec \uacc4\uc57d \uc704\uc784\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4. \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\uc5d0\uc11c 90%\uc758 \ud1a0\ud070 \uac10\uc18c\uc640 525\ubc30 \ub0ae\uc740 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\uace0, \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc704\uc784\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf4\uc874 \uc704\ubc18\uc774 \uc5c6\uc73c\uba70 \uacc4\uc57d \ubaa8\ub4dc\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uce21\uc815 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud488\uc9c8-\uc790\uc6d0 \uad50\ud658\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b8\ub2e4. \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uacc4\uc57d\uc740 \uc608\uce21 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uac10\uc0ac \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uba70 \uc790\uc6d0\uc5d0 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc790\uc728 AI \ubc30\ud3ec\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud615\uc2dd\uc801 \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

Without explicit memory mechanisms, such accumulation disrupts logical continuity and undermines task alignment. This positions memory not as an auxiliary efficiency concern, but as a core component for sustaining coherent, goal-directed reasoning over long horizons.\n  We propose MemoBrain, an executive memory model for tool-augmented agents that constructs a dependency-aware memory over reasoning steps, capturing salient intermediate states and their logical relations. Operating as a co-pilot alongside the reasoning agent, MemoBrain organizes reasoning progress without blocking execution and actively manages the working context. Specifically, it prunes invalid steps, folds completed sub-trajectories, and preserves a compact, high-salience reasoning backbone under a fixed context budget. Together, these mechanisms enable explicit cognitive control over reasoning trajectories rather than passive context accumulation.\n  We evaluate MemoBrain on challenging long-horizon benchmarks, including GAIA, WebWalker, and BrowseComp-Plus, demonstrating consistent improvements over strong baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "MemoBrain\uc740 \ub3c4\uad6c \ubcf4\uc870 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c, \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc5f0\uc18d\uc131\uacfc \uc791\uc5c5 \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc720\uc758\ubbf8\ud55c \uc911\uac04 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub3c4\uad6c \ubcf4\uc870 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ucd94\ub860\uc740 \uae34 \uc2dc\uac04 \ubc94\uc704\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ubbc0\ub85c, \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774 \uc5c6\uc73c\uba74 \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc5f0\uc18d\uc131\uc774 \ubc29\ud574\ubc1b\uace0 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc815\ub82c\uc774 \uc800\ud558\ub41c\ub2e4.", "method": "MemoBrain\uc740 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc758\uc874\uc131 \uc778\uc2dd \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\ub97c \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \ucd94\ub860 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \ud568\uaed8 \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\uba70, \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \uc911\uac04 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \ucea1\ucc98\ud558\uace0, \uc2e4\ud589\uc744 \ucc28\ub2e8\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba74\uc11c \ucd94\ub860 \uc9c4\ud589\uc744 \uc815\ub9ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "MemoBrain\uc740 GAIA, WebWalker \ubc0f BrowseComp-Plus\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc778 \uae34 \uc2dc\uac04 \ubc94\uc704\uc758 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\ub294 \uae34 \uc2dc\uac04 \ub3d9\uc548 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uace0 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc9c0\ud5a5\uc801\uc778 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud575\uc2ec \uc694\uc18c\ub85c \uc790\ub9ac\ub9e4\uae40\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub3c4\uad6c \ubcf4\uc870 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ucd94\ub860\uc740 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uae34 \uc2dc\uac04 \ubc94\uc704\ub97c \uac00\uc9c0\uba70, \uc774\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ucd94\ub860 \ud754\uc801\uacfc \uc77c\uc2dc\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0b0\ubb3c\uc774 \ucd95\uc801\ub418\uc5b4 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc791\uc5c5 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0 \ubd80\ub2f4\uc744 \uc900\ub2e4. \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc778 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774 \uc5c6\uc73c\uba74 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ucd95\uc801\uc740 \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc5f0\uc18d\uc131\uc744 \ubc29\ud574\ud558\uace0 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \uc800\ud558\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\ub97c \ubcf4\uc870\uc801\uc778 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \ubcf4\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0, \uae34 \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uace0 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc9c0\ud5a5\uc801\uc778 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc9c0\uc18d\ud558\ub294 \ud575\uc2ec \uc694\uc18c\ub85c \uc790\ub9ac\ub9e4\uae40\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc758\uc874\uc131 \uc778\uc2dd \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\ub97c \uad6c\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub3c4\uad6c \ubcf4\uc870 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc9d1\ud589 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ubaa8\ub378\uc778 MemoBrain\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

However, traditional static graph construction methods based on Euclidean distance often fail to capture the intrinsic curvature characteristics of the data manifold. Although Ollivier-Ricci Curvature Flow (OCF) has proven to be a powerful tool for dynamic topological optimization, its core reliance on Optimal Transport (Wasserstein distance) leads to prohibitive computational complexity, severely limiting its application in large-scale datasets and deep learning frameworks. To break this bottleneck, this paper proposes a novel geometric evolution framework: Resistance Curvature Flow (RCF). Leveraging the concept of effective resistance from circuit physics, RCF transforms expensive curvature optimization into efficient matrix operations. This approach achieves over 100x computational acceleration while maintaining geometric optimization capabilities comparable to OCF. We provide an in-depth exploration of the theoretical foundations and dynamical principles of RCF, elucidating how it guides the redistribution of edge weights via curvature gradients to eliminate topological noise and strengthen local cluster structures. Furthermore, we provide a mechanistic explanation of RCF's role in manifold enhancement and noise suppression, as well as its compatibility with deep learning models. We design a graph optimization algorithm, DGSL-RCF, based on this framework. Experimental results across deep metric learning, manifold learning, and graph structure learning demonstrate that DGSL-RCF significantly improves representation quality and downstream task

Clients request content through ANs acting as gateways, without observing AN states or the actions of other clients. We define the reward as the age of information reduction resulting from a client's selection of an AN, and formulate the problem as a non-stationary multi-armed bandit. In this decentralized and partially observable setting, the resulting reward process is history-dependent and coupled across clients, and exhibits both abrupt and gradual changes in expected rewards, rendering classical bandit-based approaches ineffective. To address these challenges, we propose the AGING BANDIT WITH ADAPTIVE RESET algorithm, which combines adaptive windowing with periodic monitoring to track evolving reward distributions. We establish theoretical performance guarantees showing that the proposed algorithm achieves near-optimal performance, and we validate the theoretical results through simulations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub2e4\uc218\uc758 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8, \uc561\uc138\uc2a4 \ub178\ub4dc \ubc0f \uc11c\ubc84\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \uc5e3\uc9c0 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\uc758 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc2e0\uc120\ub3c4\ub97c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubd84\uc0b0 \ud611\ub825 \uc694\uccad \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\uc758 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc2e0\uc120\ub3c4\ub97c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uc131.", "method": "\ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\uac00 \uc561\uc138\uc2a4 \ub178\ub4dc\ub97c \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\ub294 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc815\ubcf4\uc758 \uc5f0\ub839 \uac10\uc18c\ub97c \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\uc758\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \ub2e4\uc911\ud314 \ub2e8\uce58 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud55c\ub2e4.

However, naive \"act-as-a-user\" prompting often yields verbose, unrealistic utterances, underscoring the need for principled evaluation of so-called user proxy agents. We present MIRRORBENCH, a reproducible, extensible benchmarking framework that evaluates user proxies solely on their ability to produce human-like user utterances across diverse conversational tasks, explicitly decoupled from downstream task success. MIRRORBENCH features a modular execution engine with typed interfaces, metadata-driven registries, multi-backend support, caching, and robust observability. The system supports pluggable user proxies, datasets, tasks, and metrics, enabling researchers to evaluate arbitrary simulators under a uniform, variance-aware harness. We include three lexical-diversity metrics (MATTR, YULE'S K, and HD-D) and three LLM-judge-based metrics (GTEval, Pairwise Indistinguishability, and Rubric-and-Reason). Across four open datasets, MIRRORBENCH yields variance-aware results and reveals systematic gaps between user proxies and real human users. The framework is open source and includes a simple command-line interface for running experiments, managing configurations and caching, and generating reports.

However, existing MARL approaches often rely on frequent exchanges of action or state information among agents to achieve effective coordination, which is difficult to satisfy in practical robotic systems. A common solution is to introduce estimator networks to model the behaviors of other agents and predict their actions; nevertheless, such designs cause the size and computational cost of the estimator networks to grow rapidly with the number of agents, thereby limiting scalability in large-scale systems.\n  To address these challenges, this paper proposes a multiagent learning framework augmented with a Collective Influence Estimation Network (CIEN). By explicitly modeling the collective influence of other agents on the task object, each agent can infer critical interaction information solely from its local observations and the task object's states, enabling efficient collaboration without explicit action information exchange. The proposed framework effectively avoids network expansion as the team size increases; moreover, new agents can be incorporated without modifying the network structures of existing agents, demonstrating strong scalability. Experimental results on multiagent cooperative tasks based on the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm show that the proposed method achieves stable and efficient coordination under communication-limited environments.

Papalexakis"], "title": "A Preliminary Agentic Framework for Matrix Deflation", "comment": null, "summary": "Can a small team of agents peel a matrix apart, one rank-1 slice at a time? We propose an agentic approach to matrix deflation in which a solver Large Language Model (LLM) generates rank-1 Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) updates and a Vision Language Model (VLM) accepts or rejects each update and decides when to stop, eliminating fixed norm thresholds. Solver stability is improved through in-context learning (ICL) and types of row/column permutations that expose visually coherent structure. We evaluate on Digits ($8{\\times}8$), CIFAR-10 ($32{\\times}32$ grayscale), and synthetic ($16{\\times}16$) matrices with and without Gaussian noise. In the synthetic noisy case, where the true construction rank $k$ is known, numerical deflation provides the noise target and our best agentic configuration differs by only $1.75$ RMSE of the target. For Digits and CIFAR-10, targets are defined by deflating until the Frobenius norm reaches $10\\%$ of the original. Across all settings, our agent achieves competitive results, suggesting that fully agentic, threshold-free deflation is a viable alternative to classical numerical algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc18c\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud300\uc774 \ud589\ub82c\uc744 \ud558\ub098\uc758 \uc21c\uc704-1 \uc2ac\ub77c\uc774\uc2a4\uc529 \ubd84\ud574\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uac00?", "motivation": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uace0\uc815\ub41c \ub178\ub984 \uc784\uacc4\uac12\uc744 \uc81c\uac70\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \ud574\uacb0\uc790 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc774 \uc21c\uc704-1 \ud2b9\uc774\uac12 \ubd84\ud574(SVD) \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0, \ube44\uc804 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(VLM)\uc774 \uac01 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \uc218\uc6a9\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uac70\ubd80\ud558\uba70 \uc911\ub2e8\ud560 \uc2dc\uc810\uc744 \uacb0\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud589\ub82c \ud655\uc7a5\uc744 \uc704\ud574, \ud574\uacb0\uc790\uc758 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc740 \uc778\ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud559\uc2b5(ICL)\uacfc \uc2dc\uac01\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc77c\uad00\uc131 \uc788\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b4\ub294 \ud589/\uc5f4 \uc21c\uc5f4\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Digits ($8{\times}8$), CIFAR-10 ($32{\times}32$ \uadf8\ub808\uc774\uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c), \ubc0f \ud569\uc131($16{\times}16$) \ud589\ub82c\uc744 \uac00\uc6b0\uc2dc\uc548 \ub178\uc774\uc988 \uc720\ubb34\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud569\uc131 \ub178\uc774\uc988 \uc0ac\ub840\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\uc81c \uad6c\uc131 \uc21c\uc704 $k$\uac00 \uc54c\ub824\uc838 \uc788\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0, \uc218\uce58\uc801 \ud655\uc7a5\uc740 \ub178\uc774\uc988 \ub300\uc0c1\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ucd5c\uc0c1\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uad6c\uc131\uc740 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc640\uc758 RMSE \ucc28\uc774\uac00 \ub2e8\uc9c0 $1.75$\uc5d0 \ubd88\uacfc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uc644\uc804\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc784\uacc4\uac12 \uc5c6\ub294 \ud655\uc7a5\uc774 \uace0\uc804 \uc218\uce58 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub300\uc548\uc784\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc18c\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud300\uc774 \ud589\ub82c\uc744 \ud558\ub098\uc758 \uc21c\uc704-1 \uc2ac\ub77c\uc774\uc2a4\uc529 \ubd84\ud574\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uac00? \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud574\uacb0\uc790 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc774 \uc21c\uc704-1 \ud2b9\uc774\uac12 \ubd84\ud574(SVD) \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 \ube44\uc804 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(VLM)\uc774 \uac01 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \uc218\uc6a9 \ub610\ub294 \uac70\ubd80\ud558\uba70 \uc5b8\uc81c \uc911\ub2e8\ud560\uc9c0\ub97c \uacb0\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc801 \uc811\uadfc\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uace0\uc815\ub41c \ub178\ub984 \uc784\uacc4\uac12\uc744 \uc81c\uac70\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud574\uacb0\uc790 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc740 \uc778\ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud559\uc2b5(ICL)\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uac1c\uc120\ub418\uba70, \uc2dc\uac01\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b4\ub294 \ud589/\uc5f4 \uc21c\uc5f4\uc758 \uc720\ud615\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uac15\ud654\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Digits($8{\times}8$), CIFAR-10($32{\times}32$ \uadf8\ub808\uc774\uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c), \ubc0f \ud569\uc131($16{\times}16$) \ud589\ub82c\uc744 \uac00\uc6b0\uc2dc\uc548 \ub178\uc774\uc988 \uc720\ubb34\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud569\uc131 \ub178\uc774\uc988 \uc0ac\ub840\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\uc81c \uad6c\uc131 \uc21c\uc704 $k$\uac00 \uc54c\ub824\uc838 \uc788\uc744 \ub54c, \uc218\uce58\uc801 \ud655\uc7a5\uc740 \ub178\uc774\uc988 \ub300\uc0c1\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ucd5c\uc0c1\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uad6c\uc131\uc740 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc640\uc758 RMSE \ucc28\uc774\uac00 \ub2e8  $1.75$ \ubc16\uc5d0 \ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Existing approaches either rely on utilization-based heuristics that overlook stall times, or require extensive offline profiling for table generation, preventing runtime adaptation. We propose a model-based hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for thermal- and energy-aware scheduling on multi-core platforms. Two collaborative agents decompose the exponential action space, achieving 358ms latency for subsequent decisions. First decisions require 3.5 to 8.0s including one-time LLM feature extraction. An accurate environment model leverages regression techniques to predict thermal dynamics and performance states. When combined with LLM-extracted semantic features, the environment model enables zero-shot deployment for new workloads on trained platforms by generating synthetic training data without requiring workload-specific profiling samples. We introduce LLM-based semantic feature extraction that characterizes OpenMP programs through 13 code-level features without execution. The Dyna-Q-inspired framework integrates direct reinforcement learning with model-based planning, achieving 20x faster convergence than model-free methods. Experiments on BOTS and PolybenchC benchmarks across NVIDIA Jetson TX2, Jetson Orin NX, RubikPi, and Intel Core i7 demonstrate 7.09x better energy efficiency and 4.0x better makespan than Linux ondemand governor.

Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) models for financial decision-making assume rational agents, potentially overlooking the impact of psychological factors. This study integrates cognitive biases into RL frameworks for financial trading, hypothesizing that such models can exhibit human-like trading behavior and achieve better risk-adjusted returns than standard RL agents. We introduce biases, such as overconfidence and loss aversion, into reward structures and decision-making processes and evaluate their performance in simulated and real-world trading environments. Despite its inconclusive or negative results, this study provides insights into the challenges of incorporating human-like biases into RL, offering valuable lessons for developing robust financial AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc7ac\uc815 \uac70\ub798\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uc778\uc9c0 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc778\uac04\uacfc \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uac70\ub798 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\uace0 \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc704\ud5d8 \uc870\uc815 \uc218\uc775\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc7ac\uc815 \uc2dc\uc7a5\uc740 \uc778\uc9c0 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ube44\ud569\ub9ac\uc801\uc778 \uc778\uac04 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubc1b\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ud569\ub9ac\uc801\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uac00\uc815\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc2ec\ub9ac\uc801 \uc694\uc778\uc758 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uac04\uacfc\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uad6c\uc870\uc640 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0 \uacfc\uc2e0 \ubc0f \uc190\uc2e4 \ud68c\ud53c\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc7ac\uc815 \uac70\ub798\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ubaa8\uc758 \ubc0f \uc2e4\uc81c \uac70\ub798 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\ub4e4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uacb0\uacfc\uac00 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ubd80\uc815\uc801\uc77c\uc9c0\ub77c\ub3c4, \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0 \uc778\uac04 \uc720\uc0ac \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub530\ub978 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\ud559\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc7ac\uc815 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uadc0\uc911\ud55c \uad50\ud6c8\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc7ac\uc815 \uc2dc\uc7a5\uc740 \uc778\uc9c0 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ud569\ub9ac\uc131\uc774 \ubc97\uc5b4\ub09c \uc778\uac04 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubc1b\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc7ac\uc815 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL) \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ud569\ub9ac\uc801\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uac00\uc815\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc2ec\ub9ac\uc801 \uc694\uc778\uc758 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uac04\uacfc\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc7ac\uc815 \uac70\ub798\ub97c \uc704\ud574 RL \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0 \uc778\uc9c0 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc778\uac04\uacfc \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uac70\ub798 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\uace0 \ud45c\uc900 RL \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc704\ud5d8 \uc870\uc815 \uc218\uc775\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uac00\uc124\uc744 \uc138\uc6c1\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uacfc\uc2e0 \ubc0f \uc190\uc2e4 \ud68c\ud53c\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uad6c\uc870 \ubc0f \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0, \ubaa8\uc758 \ubc0f \uc2e4\uc81c \uac70\ub798 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacb0\uacfc\uac00 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ubd80\uc815\uc801\uc77c\uc9c0\ub77c\ub3c4, \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 RL\uc5d0 \uc778\uac04 \uc720\uc0ac \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub530\ub978 \ub3c4\uc804\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc7ac\uc815 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uadc0\uc911\ud55c \uad50\ud6c8\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

We identify three key challenges: dynamic task scheduling, active exploration under uncertainty, and continuous learning from experience. To bridge this gap, we introduce \\method{}, a dynamic evaluation environment that simulates a \"trainee\" agent continuously exploring a novel setting. Unlike traditional benchmarks, \\method{} evaluates agents along three dimensions: (1) context-aware scheduling for streaming tasks with varying priorities; (2) prudent information acquisition to reduce hallucination via active exploration; and (3) continuous evolution by distilling generalized strategies from rule-based, dynamically generated tasks. Experiments show that cutting-edge agents have significant deficiencies in dynamic environments, especially in active exploration and continual learning. Our work establishes a framework for assessing agent reliability, shifting evaluation from static tests to realistic, production-oriented scenarios.

To address this, prior work explores various strategies to infer an appropriate reasoning budget from the input. However, such approaches are unreliable in the worst case, as estimating the minimal required reasoning effort is fundamentally difficult, and they implicitly fix the trade-off between reasoning cost and accuracy during training, limiting flexibility under varying deployment scenarios. Motivated by these limitations, we propose ORBIT, a controllable multi-budget reasoning framework with well-separated reasoning modes triggered by input. ORBIT employs multi-stage reinforcement learning to discover Pareto-optimal reasoning behaviors at each effort, followed by on-policy distillation to fuse these behaviors into a single unified model. Experiments show that ORBIT achieves (1) controllable reasoning behavior over multiple modes, (2) competitive reasoning density within each mode, and (3) integration of these frontier policies into a single unified student model while preserving clear mode separation and high per-mode performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "ORBIT\ub294 \uc785\ub825\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ub3d9\uc791\ub418\ub294 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc608\uc0b0 \ucd94\ub860 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub2e8\uacc4\uc758 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub4e4\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ub178\ub825\uc744 \ucd94\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 fundamentally \uc5b4\ub835\uace0, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub3d9\uc548 \ucd94\ub860 \ube44\uc6a9\uacfc \uc815\ud655\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uace0\uc815\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc720\uc5f0\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "ORBIT\ub294 \uc785\ub825\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ud2b8\ub9ac\uac70\ub418\ub294 \uc798 \uad6c\ubd84\ub41c \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub4dc\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc608\uc0b0 \ucd94\ub860 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub2e8\uacc4\uc758 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uac01 \ub178\ub825\uc5d0\uc11c \ud30c\ub808\ud1a0 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uace0, \uc815\ucc45 \uc99d\ub958\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ub2e8\uc77c \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c \uc735\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "ORBIT\ub294 (1) \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubaa8\ub4dc\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\uc5b4 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \ud589\ub3d9, (2) \uac01 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \ucd94\ub860 \ubc00\ub3c4, (3) \uba85\ud655\ud55c \ubaa8\ub4dc \uad6c\ubd84\uacfc \ub192\uc740 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ubcc4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc774 \uacbd\uacc4 \uc815\ucc45\ub4e4\uc744 \ub2e8\uc77c \ud1b5\ud569 \ud559\uc0dd \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "ORBIT\ub294 \uc785\ub825\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ucd94\ub860 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uace0 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc \ub300\ud615 \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub378(LRMs)\uc740 \uc7a5\uae30\uc801\uc778 \uc5f0\uc1c4\uc801 \uc0ac\uace0(CoT) \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc \uc9c0\ub098\uce58\uac8c \uae34 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uade0\uc77c\ud558\uac8c \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uba74 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud558\uace0 \uc885\uc885 \ubd88\ud544\uc694\ud55c \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc774\uc804 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub4e4\uc740 \uc785\ub825\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc801\uc808\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uc608\uc0b0\uc744 \ucd94\ub860\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ucd5c\uc545\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\uc73c\uba70, \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ucd5c\uc18c \ucd94\ub860 \ub178\ub825\uc744 \ucd94\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5b4\ub835\uace0, \ud6c8\ub828 \uc911 \ucd94\ub860 \ube44\uc6a9\uacfc \uc815\ud655\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uc554\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uace0\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubc30\ud3ec \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc720\uc5f0\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uace0\uc790 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc785\ub825\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ud2b8\ub9ac\uac70\ub418\ub294 \uc798 \uad6c\ubd84\ub41c \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub4dc\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc608\uc0b0 \ucd94\ub860 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 ORBIT\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

Existing systems implicitly presuppose fixed primitive units -- tokens, subwords, pixels, or predefined sensor channels -- thereby bypassing the question of how representational units themselves emerge and stabilize. This paper proposes SANC(E3), an axiomatic framework in which representational units are not given a priori but instead arise as stable outcomes of competitive selection, reconstruction, and compression under finite activation capacity, governed by the explicit minimization of an energy functional E3. SANC(E3) draws a principled distinction between system tokens -- structural anchors such as {here, now, I} and sensory sources -- and tokens that emerge through self-organization during co-occurring events. Five core axioms formalize finite capacity, association from co-occurrence, similarity-based competition, confidence-based stabilization, and the reconstruction-compression-update trade-off. A key feature is a pseudo-memory-mapped I/O mechanism, through which internally replayed Gestalts are processed via the same axiomatic pathway as external sensory input. As a result, perception, imagination, prediction, planning, and action are unified within a single representational and energetic process. From the axioms, twelve propositions are derived, showing that category formation, hierarchical organization, unsupervised learning, and high-level cognitive activities can all be understood as instances of Gestalt completion under E3 minimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 SANC(E3)\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ucd95\uc801\uc758 \ud2c0\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec, \ud45c\ud604 \uc7a5\uce58\uac00 \uace0\uc815\ub41c \uac83\uc774 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uc720\ud55c \uc790\uc6d0 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uacbd\uc7c1 \uc120\ud0dd, \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131 \ubc0f \uc555\ucd95\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ub428\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uacb0\uc815\ub860\uc801 \ub9ac\uc18c\uc2a4 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uc608\uce21 \ubc0f \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \ub0b4\ubd80 \uad6c\uc870\ub85c \uacbd\ud5d8\uc744 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131.", "method": "SANC(E3) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ud45c\ud604 \uc7a5\uce58\uac00 \uace0\uc815\ub41c \uac83\uc774 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \ud568\uc218 E3\uc758 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uacb0\uacfc\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ud1a0\ud070\uacfc \uc790\uac00 \uc870\uc9c1\ud654 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \ud1a0\ud070 \uac04\uc758 \uc6d0\uce59\uc801\uc778 \uad6c\ubcc4; \uacb0\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\uc2dd, \uc0c1\uc0c1, \uc608\uce21, \uacc4\ud68d \ubc0f \ud589\ub3d9\uc774 \ub2e8\uc77c \ud45c\ud604\uc801 \ubc0f \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0\uc801 \uacfc\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \ud1b5\ud569\ub428.", "conclusion": "\uce74\ud14c\uace0\ub9ac \ud615\uc131, \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc870\uc9c1, \ube44\uc9c0\ub3c4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc0f \uace0\uae09 \uc778\uc9c0 \ud65c\ub3d9\ub4e4\uc740 \ubaa8\ub450 E3 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uac8c\uc288\ud0c8\ud2b8 \uc644\uc131 \uc0ac\ub840\ub85c \uc774\ud574\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc77c\ubc18 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc740 \uc720\ud55c\ud55c \uc790\uc6d0 \ud558\uc5d0 \uc608\uce21 \ubc0f \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \ub0b4\ubd80 \uad6c\uc870\ub85c \uacbd\ud5d8\uc744 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uace0\uc815\ub41c \uc6d0\uc2dc \ub2e8\uc704\u2013\ud1a0\ud070, \uc11c\ube0c\uc6cc\ub4dc, \ud53d\uc140 \ub610\ub294 \ubbf8\ub9ac \uc815\uc758\ub41c \uc13c\uc11c \ucc44\ub110\u2013\ub97c \uc554\ubb35\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\uc81c\ud558\uc5ec \ud45c\ud604 \ub2e8\uc704\uac00 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uace0 \uc548\uc815\ud654\ub418\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc6b0\ud68c\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 SANC(E3)\ub77c\ub294 \uacf5\ub9ac\uc801 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec, \ud45c\ud604 \ub2e8\uc704\uac00 a priori\ub85c \uc8fc\uc5b4\uc9c0\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uacbd\uc7c1 \uc120\ud0dd, \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uc720\ud55c\ud55c \ud65c\uc131\ud654 \uc6a9\ub7c9 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uc555\ucd95\uc758 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uacb0\uacfc\ub85c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4.

However, their effectiveness in addressing radiomics-specific challenges remains unclear. This study evaluates the performance, efficiency, and accessibility of general-purpose and radiomics-specific AutoML frameworks on diverse radiomics classification tasks, thereby highlighting development needs for radiomics. Ten public/private radiomics datasets with varied imaging modalities (CT/MRI), sizes, anatomies and endpoints were used. Six general-purpose and five radiomics-specific frameworks were tested with predefined parameters using standardized cross-validation. Evaluation metrics included AUC, runtime, together with qualitative aspects related to software status, accessibility, and interpretability. Simplatab, a radiomics-specific tool with a no-code interface, achieved the highest average test AUC (81.81%) with a moderate runtime (~1 hour). LightAutoML, a general-purpose framework, showed the fastest execution with competitive performance (78.74% mean AUC in six minutes). Most radiomics-specific frameworks were excluded from the performance analysis due to obsolescence, extensive programming requirements, or computational inefficiency. Conversely, general-purpose frameworks demonstrated higher accessibility and ease of implementation. Simplatab provides an effective balance of performance, efficiency, and accessibility for radiomics classification problems. However, significant gaps remain, including the lack of accessible survival analysis support and the limited integration of feature reproducibility and harmonization within current AutoML frameworks. Future research should focus on adapting AutoML solutions to better address these radiomics-specific challenges.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uba38\uc2e0\ub7ec\ub2dd(AutoML)

However, existing CI benchmarks are largely text-centric and primarily emphasize negative refusal scenarios, overlooking multimodal privacy risks and the fundamental trade-off between privacy and utility. In this paper, we introduce MPCI-Bench, the first Multimodal Pairwise Contextual Integrity benchmark for evaluating privacy behavior in agentic settings. MPCI-Bench consists of paired positive and negative instances derived from the same visual source and instantiated across three tiers: normative Seed judgments, context-rich Story reasoning, and executable agent action Traces. Data quality is ensured through a Tri-Principle Iterative Refinement pipeline.

Existing methods for map matching are generally based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM) or encoder-decoder framework. However, these methods continue to face significant challenges when handling noisy or sparsely sampled GPS trajectories. To address these limitations, we propose DiffMM, an encoder-diffusion-based map matching framework that produces effective yet efficient matching results through a one-step diffusion process. We first introduce a road segment-aware trajectory encoder that jointly embeds the input trajectory and its surrounding candidate road segments into a shared latent space through an attention mechanism. Next, we propose a one step diffusion method to realize map matching through a shortcut model by leveraging the joint embedding of the trajectory and candidate road segments as conditioning context. We conduct extensive experiments on large-scale trajectory datasets, demonstrating that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art map matching methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency, particularly for sparse trajectories and complex road network topologies.", "AI": {"tldr": "DiffMM\uc740 \ud76c\uc18c \uada4\uc801\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ub9f5 \ub9e4\uce6d \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc5d4\ucf54\ub354-\ud655\uc0b0 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud76c\uc18c \uada4\uc801\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub9f5 \ub9e4\uce6d\uc740 \uad50\ud1b5 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\ub9c1 \ubc0f \uad50\ud1b5 \ud750\ub984 \ubd84\uc11d \ub4f1 \ub9ce\uc740 \uada4\uc801 \uae30\ubc18 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4 \uae30\ubcf8 \ubb38\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "DiffMM\uc740 \uc8fc\uc758 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc785\ub825 \uada4\uc801\uacfc \uc8fc\ubcc0 \ud6c4\ubcf4 \ub3c4\ub85c \uc138\uadf8\uba3c\ud2b8\ub97c \uacf5\uc720 \uc7a0\uc7ac \uacf5\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \uacb0\ud569\ud558\ub294 \ub3c4\ub85c \uc138\uadf8\uba3c\ud2b8 \uc778\uc2dd \uada4\uc801 \uc778\ucf54\ub354\uc640 \ud568\uaed8, \uada4\uc801\uacfc \ud6c4\ubcf4 \ub3c4\ub85c \uc138\uadf8\uba3c\ud2b8\uc758 \uacf5\ub3d9 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc744 \uc870\uac74\ud654 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc73c\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ud55c \ub2e8\uacc4 \ud655\uc0b0 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \ud2b9\ud788 \ud76c\uc18c \uada4\uc801\uacfc \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub3c4\ub85c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ud1a0\ud3f4\ub85c\uc9c0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc640 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc2e0 \ub9f5 \ub9e4\uce6d \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc744 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2a5\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "DiffMM\uc740 \ub178\uc774\uc988\uac00 \ub9ce\uac70\ub098 \ud76c\uc18c \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\ub41c GPS \uada4\uc801\uc744 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\uc5b4 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\ub294 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud76c\uc18c \uada4\uc801\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub9f5 \ub9e4\uce6d\uc740 \uad50\ud1b5 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\ub9c1 \ubc0f \uad50\ud1b5 \ud750\ub984 \ubd84\uc11d\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ub9ce\uc740 \uada4\uc801 \uae30\ubc18 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc758 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ubb38\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub9f5 \ub9e4\uce6d \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc740\ub2c9 \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \ubaa8\ub378(HMM)\uc774\ub098 \uc778\ucf54\ub354-\ub514\ucf54\ub354 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ub178\uc774\uc988\uac00 \ub9ce\uac70\ub098 \ud76c\uc18c \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\ub41c GPS \uada4\uc801\uc744 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud55c \ub2e8\uacc4\uc758 \ud655\uc0b0 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ub9e4\uce6d \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc5d4\ucf54\ub354-\ud655\uc0b0 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ub9f5 \ub9e4\uce6d \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 DiffMM\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uba3c\uc800 \uc785\ub825 \uada4\uc801\uacfc \uc8fc\ubcc0 \ud6c4\ubcf4 \ub3c4\ub85c \uc138\uadf8\uba3c\ud2b8\ub97c \uc8fc\uc758 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uacf5\uc720 \uc7a0\uc7ac \uacf5\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \ud568\uaed8 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\ud558\ub294 \ub3c4\ub85c \uc138\uadf8\uba3c\ud2b8 \uc778\uc2dd \uada4\uc801 \uc778\ucf54\ub354\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc74c\uc73c\ub85c, \uada4\uc801\uacfc \ud6c4\ubcf4 \ub3c4\ub85c \uc138\uadf8\uba3c\ud2b8\uc758 \uacf5\ub3d9 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc744 \uc870\uac74\ud654 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc73c\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e8\ucd95 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub9f5 \ub9e4\uce6d\uc744 \uc2e4\ud604\ud558\ub294 \ud55c \ub2e8\uacc4 \ud655\uc0b0 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uada4\uc801 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc5ec, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc774 \ud76c\uc18c \uada4\uc801 \ubc0f \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub3c4\ub85c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ud1a0\ud3f4\ub85c\uc9c0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc640 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc2e0 \ub9f5 \ub9e4\uce6d \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc744 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2a5\uac00\ud568\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

This difficulty is amplified by credit assignment ambiguity, environmental non-stationarity, and the combinatorial growth of interaction complexity. We argue that recent advances in large language models (LLMs) point toward a shift from hand-crafted numerical rewards to language-based objective specifications. Prior work has shown that LLMs can synthesize reward functions directly from natural language descriptions (e.g., EUREKA) and adapt reward formulations online with minimal human intervention (e.g., CARD). In parallel, the emerging paradigm of Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) provides empirical evidence that language-mediated supervision can serve as a viable alternative to traditional reward engineering. We conceptualize this transition along three dimensions: semantic reward specification, dynamic reward adaptation, and improved alignment with human intent, while noting open challenges related to computational overhead, robustness to hallucination, and scalability to large multi-agent systems. We conclude by outlining a research direction in which coordination arises from shared semantic representations rather than explicitly engineered numerical signals.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf4\uc0c1 \uacf5\ud559\uc740 \uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \uc218\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\uc758\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774\uba70, \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub85c \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc\uc758 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \uc218\uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uc791\ub41c \uc218\uce58\uc801 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5b8\uc5b4 \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc0ac\uc591\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \uc804\ud658\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4.

Although RL agents can converge to optimal solutions, the definition of ``optimality'' depends on the environment's statistical properties. The Bellman equation, central to most RL algorithms, is formulated in terms of expected values of future rewards. However, when ergodicity is broken, long-term outcomes depend on the specific trajectory rather than on the ensemble average. In such settings, the ensemble average diverges from the time-average growth experienced by individual agents, with expected-value formulations yielding systematically suboptimal policies. Prior studies demonstrated that traditional RL architectures fail to recover the true optimum in non-ergodic environments. We extend this analysis to deep RL implementations and show that these, too, produce suboptimal policies under non-ergodic dynamics. Introducing explicit time dependence into the learning process can correct this limitation. By allowing the network's function approximation to incorporate temporal information, the agent can estimate value functions consistent with the process's intrinsic growth rate.

We formalize this setting as Sparse Agentic Control (SAC), where policies admit block-sparse representations over M >> 1 actions and rewards depend on sparse main effects and (optionally) sparse synergies. We study ell_{1,2}-regularized policy learning through a convex surrogate and establish sharp, compressed-sensing-style results: (i) estimation and value suboptimality scale as k (log M / T)^{1/2} under a Policy-RSC condition; (ii) exact tool-support recovery holds via primal-dual witness arguments when T > k log M under incoherence and beta-min; and (iii) any dense policy class requires Omega(M) samples, explaining the instability of prompt-only controllers. We further show that under partial observability, LLMs matter only through a belief/representation error epsilon_b, yielding an additive O(epsilon_b) degradation while preserving logarithmic dependence on M.

However, current architectures face severe scalability and generality bottlenecks. To address this, we propose ToolACE-MCP, a pipeline for training history-aware routers to empower precise navigation in large-scale ecosystems. By leveraging a dependency-rich candidate Graph to synthesize multi-turn trajectories, we effectively train routers with dynamic context understanding to create the plug-and-play Light Routing Agent. Experiments on the real-world benchmarks MCP-Universe and MCP-Mark demonstrate superior performance. Notably, ToolACE-MCP exhibits critical properties for the future Agent Web: it not only generalizes to multi-agent collaboration with minimal adaptation but also maintains exceptional robustness against noise and scales effectively to massive candidate spaces.

Despite this scale, empirical evidence suggests that only a small subset of actions meaningfully influences performance in a given deployment. Motivated by this observation, we study a contextual linear reward model in which action relevance is governed by a structured sparsity assumption: only a small number of actions have nonzero effects across latent states.\n  We formulate action discovery as a block-sparse recovery problem and analyze a greedy algorithm inspired by Orthogonal Matching Pursuit. Under standard assumptions on incoherence, signal strength, and action coverage, we prove that the greedy procedure exactly recovers the relevant action set with high probability, using a number of samples that scales polynomially in the sparsity level and latent dimension, and only logarithmically in the total number of actions. We further provide estimation error guarantees for refitted parameters and show that the resulting decision rule is near-optimal for new latent states.\n  Complementing these results, we establish information-theoretic lower bounds demonstrating that sparsity and sufficient coverage are necessary for tractability. Together, our results identify sparse action discovery as a fundamental principle underlying large-action decision-making and provide a theoretical foundation for action pruning in agentic systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud070 \ud589\ub3d9 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\ub294 \ud604\ub300 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\ud6a8\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9 \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud589\ub3d9\uc758 \uc18c\uc218\ub9cc\uc774 \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc788\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce5c\ub2e4\ub294 \uad00\ucc30\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ub3d9\uae30\ub97c \ubd80\uc5ec\ubc1b\uc558\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud589\ub3d9 \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \ube14\ub85d-\uc2a4\ud30c\uc2a4 \ubcf5\uad6c \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uace0, Orthogonal Matching Pursuit\uc5d0\uc11c \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc740 \ud0d0\uc695\uc801 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc870\uac74\ubd80 \ud655\ub960\uc774 \ub192\uc744 \uacbd\uc6b0, \ud0d0\uc695\uc801 \uc808\ucc28\uac00 \uad00\ub828 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \uc815\ud655\ud788 \ud68c\ubcf5\ud568\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ud76c\uc18c\uc131\uacfc \ucda9\ubd84\ud55c \ucee4\ubc84\ub9ac\uc9c0\uac00 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ud558\ud55c\uc744 \uc124\uc815\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc758 \uae30\ubcf8 \uc6d0\ub9ac\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud604\ub300\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc218\ucc9c \uac1c\uc758 \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c API \ub610\ub294 \uac80\uc0c9 \uc791\uc5c5\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ud070 \ud589\ub3d9 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\ub3d9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uaddc\ubaa8\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \uc2e4\uc99d\uc801 \uc99d\uac70\ub294 \uc8fc\uc5b4\uc9c4 \ubc30\ud3ec\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc788\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \ud589\ub3d9\uc758 \uc18c\uc218\ub9cc\uc774 \uc874\uc7ac\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uad00\ucc30\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ub3d9\uae30\ub97c \ubd80\uc5ec\ubc1b\uc544, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud589\ub3d9\uc758 \uad00\ub828\uc131\uc774 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ud76c\uc18c\uc131 \uac00\uc815\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc9c0\ubc30\ub418\ub294 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc801 \uc120\ud615 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud589\ub3d9 \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \ube14\ub85d-\uc2a4\ud30c\uc2a4 \ubcf5\uad6c \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uace0, Orthogonal Matching Pursuit\uc5d0\uc11c \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc740 \ud0d0\uc695\uc801 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ube44\uc77c\uad00\uc131, \uc2e0\ud638 \uac15\ub3c4 \ubc0f \ud589\ub3d9 \ubc94\uc704\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud45c\uc900 \uac00\uc815 \ud558\uc5d0, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud0d0\uc695\uc801 \uc808\ucc28\uac00 \ub192\uc740 \ud655\ub960\ub85c \uad00\ub828 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \ud68c\ubcf5\ud568\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc0d8\ud50c \uc218\ub294 \ud76c\uc18c\uc131 \uc218\uc900 \ubc0f \uc7a0\uc7ac \ucc28\uc6d0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub2e4\ud56d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ub418\uace0 \ucd1d \ud589\ub3d9 \uc218\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574\uc11c\ub9cc \ub85c\uadf8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub610\ud55c \uc7ac\uc870\uc815\ub41c \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucd94\uc815 \uc624\ucc28 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0 \uacb0\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \uacb0\uc815 \uaddc\uce59\uc774 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc7a0\uc7ac \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uac70\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc644\ud558\uc5ec, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud76c\uc18c\uc131\uacfc \ucda9\ubd84\ud55c \ubc94\uc704\uac00 \uac00\uacf5 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ud558\ud55c\uc744 \uc124\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ud76c\uc18c\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9 \ubc1c\uacac\uc774 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc758 \uadfc\ubcf8 \uc6d0\ub9ac\ub85c \uc791\uc6a9\ud568\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud558\uace0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud589\ub3d9 \uac00\uc9c0\uce58\uae30\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Moreover, commonly used Chinese humor datasets are often better suited for humor understanding and evaluation than for long-form stand-up generation, making direct supervision misaligned with the target task. To address these challenges, we present OpenMic, an end-to-end multi-agent system built on AutoGen that transforms a user-provided life topic into a 3-5 minute Chinese stand-up performance and further produces a narrated comedy video. OpenMic orchestrates multiple specialized agents in a multi-round iterative loop-planning to jointly optimize humor, timing, and performability. To mitigate the dataset-task mismatch, we augment generation with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for material grounding and idea expansion, and we fine-tune a dedicated JokeWriter to better internalize stand-up-specific setup-punchline structures and long-range callbacks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc911\uad6d\uc2dd \uc2a4\ud0e0\ub4dc\uc5c5 \ucf54\ubbf8\ub514 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc911\uad6d \uc2a4\ud0e0\ub4dc\uc5c5 \ucf54\ubbf8\ub514 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ubb38\ud654\uc801 \uc720\uba38\uc640 \uc815\ubc00\ud55c \ud0c0\uc774\ubc0d, \ubb34\ub300 \uc218\ud589 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc694\uad6c\uc0ac\ud56d \ud574\uacb0\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "OpenMic\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc81c\uacf5 \uc8fc\uc81c\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c 3-5\ubd84 \ubd84\ub7c9\uc758 \uc911\uad6d\uc2dd \uc2a4\ud0e0\ub4dc\uc5c5 \uacf5\uc5f0\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ub0b4\ub808\uc774\ud130\uac00 \uc124\uba85\ud558\ub294 \ub3d9\uc601\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc5ec\ub7ec \uc804\ubb38 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \uacc4\ud68d \uc218\ub9bd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc720\uba38, \ud0c0\uc774\ubc0d, \uc218\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "RAG\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc640 \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub97c \uc644\ud654\ud558\uace0, \uc2a4\ud0e0\ub4dc\uc5c5 \uc804\uc6a9 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ub0b4\ubd80\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 JokeWriter\ub97c \uc138\ubd80 \uc870\uc815\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc911\uad6d \uc2a4\ud0e0\ub4dc\uc5c5 \ucf54\ubbf8\ub514 \uc0dd\uc131\uc740 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \ub118\uc5b4\uc11c\uc11c, \ubb38\ud654\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uae30\ubc18\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uc720\uba38, \uc815\ubc00\ud55c \ud0c0\uc774\ubc0d, \ubb34\ub300 \uacf5\uc5f0 \uc2e0\ud638 \ubc0f \uc554\ubb35\uc801\uc778 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub354\uc6b1\uc774, \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \uc911\uad6d \uc720\uba38 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\ub294 \uae34 \ud615\uc2dd\uc758 \uc2a4\ud0e0\ub4dc\uc5c5 \uc0dd\uc131\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc720\uba38 \uc774\ud574\uc640 \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0 \ub354 \uc801\ud569\ud55c \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\uc544 \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc778 \uac10\ub3c5\uc774 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc791\uc5c5\uacfc \ub9de\uc9c0 \uc54a\uac8c \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc81c\uacf5 \uc0dd \uba85 \uc8fc\uc81c\ub97c 3-5\ubd84 \ubd84\ub7c9\uc758 \uc911\uad6d \uc2a4\ud0e0\ub4dc\uc5c5 \uacf5\uc5f0\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\uace0 \ucd94\uac00\ub85c \ub0b4\ub808\uc774\ud130\uac00 \uc124\uba85\ud558\ub294 \ucf54\ubbf8\ub514 \ube44\ub514\uc624\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 OpenMic\ub77c\ub294 \uc885\ub2e8 \uac04 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, most existing agent memory mechanisms rely on static and hand-crafted workflows. This limits the performance and generalization ability of these memory designs, which highlights the need for a more flexible, learning-based memory framework. In this paper, we propose AtomMem, which reframes memory management as a dynamic decision-making problem. We deconstruct high-level memory processes into fundamental atomic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, transforming the memory workflow into a learnable decision process. By combining supervised fine-tuning with reinforcement learning, AtomMem learns an autonomous, task-aligned policy to orchestrate memory behaviors tailored to specific task demands. Experimental results across 3 long-context benchmarks demonstrate that the trained AtomMem-8B consistently outperforms prior static-workflow memory methods. Further analysis of training dynamics shows that our learning-based formulation enables the agent to discover structured, task-aligned memory management strategies, highlighting a key advantage over predefined routines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\uc758 \ub3d9\uc801 \uacb0\uc815 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud55c AtomMem\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0,

We formalize this class of architectural failures as semantic laundering: a pattern where propositions with absent or weak warrant are accepted by the system as admissible by crossing architecturally trusted interfaces. We show that semantic laundering constitutes an architectural realization of the Gettier problem: propositions acquire high epistemic status without a connection between their justification and what makes them true. Unlike classical Gettier cases, this effect is not accidental; it is architecturally determined and systematically reproducible. The central result is the Theorem of Inevitable Self-Licensing: under standard architectural assumptions, circular epistemic justification cannot be eliminated. We introduce the Warrant Erosion Principle as the fundamental explanation for this effect and show that scaling, model improvement, and LLM-as-judge schemes are structurally incapable of eliminating a problem that exists at the type level.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc758 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uacb0\ud568\uc778 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc138\ud0c1(semanitic laundering) \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 Gettier \ubb38\uc81c\uc758 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc801 \uc2e4\ud604\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uc2dc\ub41c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ubcf4 \uc804\ub2ec \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uacfc \uc778\uc2dd\uc801 \uc815\ub2f9\ud654 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc758 \ud63c\ud569 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud558\ub294 \ub3d9\uae30\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd9c\ubc1c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0\uc11c \uc758\ubbf8 \uc138\ud0c1\uc744 \uc81c\uc815\uc758\ud558\uace0, Gettier \ubb38\uc81c\uc640\uc758 \uc5f0\uacb0\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6d0\ud615\uc801\uc778 \uc778\uc2dd\uc801 \uc815\ub2f9\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc124\uba85\ud558\uace0, \uc81c\uc2dc\ub41c \uc774\ub860\ub4e4\uc774 \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\uc758 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801 \uc6d0\uc778\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Warrant Erosion Principle\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\uc758 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uace0, \uae30\uc874 \uac1c\uc120 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc65c \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ub17c\uc758\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub294 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc804\ub2ec \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uacfc \uc778\uc2dd\uc801 \uc815\ub2f9\ud654 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud63c\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc801 \uc2e4\ud328\uc758 \uc774 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4\ub97c \uc758\ubbf8 \uc138\ud0c1\uc774\ub77c\uace0 \ud615\uc2dd\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4: \ubc14\ub85c \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc774 \uc5c6\uac70\ub098 \uc57d\ud55c \uba85\uc81c\uac00 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\ub97c \ub118\uc5b4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc218\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \ud328\ud134\uc774\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc138\ud0c1\uc774 Gettier \ubb38\uc81c\uc758 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc801 \uc2e4\ud604\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4: \uba85\uc81c\uac00 \uadf8 \uc815\ub2f9\ud654\uc640 \ucc38\uc744 \ub9cc\ub4dc\ub294 \uac83 \uac04\uc5d0 \uc5f0\uacb0 \uc5c6\uc774 \ub192\uc740 \uc778\uc2dd\uc801 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \ud68d\ub4dd\ud55c\ub2e4. \uace0\uc804\uc801\uc778 Gettier \uc0ac\ub840\uc640\ub294 \ub2ec\ub9ac, \uc774 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub294 \uc6b0\uc5f0\uc801\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba70; \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uacb0\uc815\ub418\uba70 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc7ac\uc0dd\uc0b0 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\ub2e4. \uc911\uc559 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ubd88\uac00\ud53c\ud55c \uc790\uae30 \uc778\uac00(theorem of inevitable self-licensing)\uc758 \uc815\ub9ac\uc774\ub2e4: \ud45c\uc900 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \uac00\uc815 \ud558\uc5d0 \uc6d0\ud615\uc801\uc778 \uc778\uc2dd\uc801 \uc815\ub2f9\ud654\ub97c \uc5c6\uc568 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uc124\uba85\uc73c\ub85c Warrant Erosion Principle\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uace0, \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1, \ubaa8\ub378 \uac1c\uc120, LLM-\uc7ac\ud310\uad00 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \ud0c0\uc785 \uc218\uc900\uc5d0\uc11c \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc5c6\uc568 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uad6c\uc870\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4."}}

However, a notable contradiction exists between the high resource consumption of large models and the real-time, lightweight requirements of UAV platforms. This paper proposes an integrated approach that combines knowledge distillation, chain-of-thought guidance, and supervised fine-tuning for UAV multi-SDK control tasks, aiming to efficiently transfer complex reasoning and code generation capabilities to smaller models. Firstly, a high-quality dataset covering various mainstream UAV SDKs is constructed, featuring instruction-code-reasoning chains, and incorporates counterfactual negative samples for data augmentation, guiding the model to learn the end-to-end logic from instruction parsing to code generation. Secondly, leveraging DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite quantized via QLoRA as the teacher model, and based on a hybrid black-box and white-box distillation strategy, high-quality chain-of-thought soft labels are generated. These are combined with a weighted cross-entropy loss using hard labels to transfer complex reasoning capabilities to the smaller student model. Finally, through prompt tuning engineering optimized for the UAV control scenario, the model performance on core tasks such as SDK type recognition and function call matching is enhanced. Experimental results indicate that the distilled lightweight model maintains high code generation accuracy while achieving significant improvements in deployment and inference efficiency, effectively demonstrating the feasibility and superiority of our approach in achieving precise and lightweight intelligent control for UAVs", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 UAV \ub2e4\uc911 SDK

However, existing benchmarks often emphasize a single capability dimension or rely solely on behavioral outcomes, overlooking rich process information from agents' decision reasoning and communicative interactions. To address this gap, we propose M3-Bench, a multi-stage benchmark for mixed-motive games, together with a process-aware evaluation framework that conducts synergistic analysis across three modules: BTA (Behavioral Trajectory Analysis), RPA (Reasoning Process Analysis), and CCA (Communication Content Analysis). Furthermore, we integrate the Big Five personality model and Social Exchange Theory to aggregate multi-dimensional evidence into interpretable social behavior portraits, thereby characterizing agents' personality traits and capability profiles beyond simple task scores or outcome-based metrics. Experimental results show that M3-Bench can reliably distinguish diverse social behavior competencies across models, and it reveals that some models achieve seemingly reasonable behavioral outcomes while exhibiting pronounced inconsistencies in their reasoning and communication.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 M3-Bench\ub77c\ub294 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc640 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \uc778\uc2dd \ud3c9\uac00 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9\uc774 \ubc1c\uc804\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub294 \ub2e8\uc77c \ub2a5\ub825 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc774\ub098 \ud589\ub3d9 \uacb0\uacfc\uc5d0\ub9cc \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815\uacfc \uc18c\ud1b5 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc758 \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uac04\uacfc\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "M3-Bench\ub294 \ud63c\ud569 \ub3d9\uae30 \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub85c, BTA(\ud589\ub3d9 \uada4\uc801 \ubd84\uc11d), RPA(\ucd94\ub860 \uacfc\uc815 \ubd84\uc11d), CCA(\uc18c\ud1b5 \ub0b4\uc6a9 \ubd84\uc11d)\ub77c\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2dc\ub108\uc9c0 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \uc778\uc2dd \ud3c9\uac00 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "M3-Bench\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378 \uac04\uc758 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc5ed\ub7c9\uc744 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uc788\uac8c \uad6c\ubd84\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc77c\ubd80 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ud569\ub9ac\uc801\uc778 \ud589\ub3d9 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uadf8 \ucd94\ub860\uacfc \uc18c\ud1b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub69c\ub837\ud55c \uc77c\uad00\uc131 \uacb0\uc5ec\ub97c \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "M3-Bench\ub294 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5 \uc810\uc218\ub098 \uacb0\uacfc \uae30\ubc18 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc744 \ub118\uc5b4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc131\uaca9 \ud2b9\uc131 \ubc0f \ub2a5\ub825 \ud504\ub85c\ud544\uc744 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud615\ud0dc\ub85c \uc9d1\uacc4\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \uacc4\uc18d \ubc1c\uc804\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ud611\ub3d9, \uae30\ub9cc, \uacf5\ubaa8\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uace0\uae09 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9\uc774 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc694\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub294 \uc885\uc885 \ud558\ub098\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uac70\ub098 \ud589\ub3d9 \uacb0\uacfc\uc5d0\ub9cc \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uacb0\uc815 \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \uc758\uc0ac\uc18c\ud1b5 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc758 \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \uacfc\uc815 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uac04\uacfc\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uc18c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud63c\ud569 \ub3d9\uae30 \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc778 M3-Bench\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, BTA(\ud589\ub3d9 \uada4\uc801 \ubd84\uc11d), RPA(\ucd94\ub860 \uacfc\uc815 \ubd84\uc11d), CCA(\uc18c\ud1b5 \ub0b4\uc6a9 \ubd84\uc11d) \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2dc\ub108\uc9c0 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \uc778\uc2dd \ud3c9\uac00 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud568\uaed8 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Big Five \uc131\uaca9 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uad50\ud658 \uc774\ub860\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\ucc28\uc6d0 \uc99d\uac70\ub97c \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9 \ucd08\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \uc9d1\uacc4\ud558\uc5ec, \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5 \uc810\uc218\ub098 \uacb0\uacfc \uae30\ubc18 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc744 \ub118\uc5b4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc131\uaca9 \ud2b9\uc131\uacfc \ub2a5\ub825 \ud504\ub85c\ud544\uc744 \ud2b9\uc9d5\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 M3-Bench\uac00 \ubaa8\ub378 \uac04\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc5ed\ub7c9\uc744 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uc788\uac8c \uad6c\ubd84\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc77c\ubd80 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud569\ub9ac\uc801\uc778 \ud589\ub3d9 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uac83\ucc98\ub7fc \ubcf4\uc784\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \uadf8\ub4e4\uc758 \ucd94\ub860\uacfc \uc758\uc0ac\uc18c\ud1b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub69c\ub837\ud55c \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b8\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4."}}

Copy trading, as a strategy-agnostic approach that eliminates the need for deep trading knowledge, quickly gains widespread popularity in the meme coin market. However, copy trading is not a guarantee of profitability due to the prevalence of manipulative bots, the uncertainty of the followed wallets' future performance, and the lag in trade execution. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in financial applications by effectively understanding multi-modal data and producing explainable decisions. However, a single LLM struggles with complex, multi-faceted tasks such as asset allocation. These challenges are even more pronounced in cryptocurrency markets, where LLMs often lack sufficient domain-specific knowledge in their training data.\n  To address these challenges, we propose an explainable multi-agent system for meme coin copy trading. Inspired by the structure of an asset management team, our system decomposes the complex task into subtasks and coordinates specialized agents to solve them collaboratively. Employing few-shot chain-of-though (CoT) prompting, each agent acquires professional meme coin trading knowledge, interprets multi-modal data, and generates explainable decisions. Using a dataset of 1,000 meme coin projects' transaction data, our empirical evaluation shows that the proposed multi-agent system outperforms both traditional machine learning models and single LLMs, achieving 73% and 70% precision in identifying high-quality meme coin projects and key opinion leader (KOL) wallets, respectively. The selected KOLs collectively generated a total profit of \\$500,000 across these projects.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 meme \ucf54\uc778 \ubcf5\uc0ac \uac70\ub798\ub97c \uc704\ud55c

We argue that this interpretation rests on a conceptual error. LLMs do not reason morally; they statistically internalize the record of human social interaction, including laws, contracts, negotiations, conflicts, and coercive arrangements. Behaviors commonly labeled as unethical or anomalous are therefore better understood as structural generalizations of interaction regimes that arise under extreme asymmetries of power, information, or constraint. Drawing on relational models theory, we show that practices such as blackmail are not categorical deviations from normal social behavior, but limiting cases within the same continuum that includes market pricing, authority relations, and ultimatum bargaining. The surprise elicited by such outputs reflects an anthropomorphic expectation that intelligence should reproduce only socially sanctioned behavior, rather than the full statistical landscape of behaviors humans themselves enact. Because human morality is plural, context-dependent, and historically contingent, the notion of a universally moral artificial intelligence is ill-defined. We therefore reframe concerns about artificial general intelligence (AGI). The primary risk is not adversarial intent, but AGI's role as an endogenous amplifier of human intelligence, power, and contradiction. By eliminating longstanding cognitive and institutional frictions, AGI compresses timescales and removes the historical margin of error that has allowed inconsistent values and governance regimes to persist without collapse.

However, professional ESG analysis is hindered by data fragmentation across unstructured sources, and existing large language models (LLMs) often struggle with the complex, multi-step workflows required for rigorous auditing. To address these limitations, we introduce ESGAgent, a hierarchical multi-agent system empowered by a specialized toolset, including retrieval augmentation, web search and domain-specific functions, to generate in-depth ESG analysis. Complementing this agentic system, we present a comprehensive three-level benchmark derived from 310 corporate sustainability reports, designed to evaluate capabilities ranging from atomic common-sense questions to the generation of integrated, in-depth analysis. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that ESGAgent outperforms state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs with an average accuracy of 84.15% on atomic question-answering tasks, and excels in professional report generation by integrating rich charts and verifiable references. These findings confirm the diagnostic value of our benchmark, establishing it as a vital testbed for assessing general and advanced agentic capabilities in high-stakes vertical domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "ESGAgent\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\uc0b0 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0 ESG \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub2e4\uacc4\uce35 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \uc9c0\uc18d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uacfc \uc724\ub9ac\uc801 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 ESG \uae30\uc900\uc774 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\ub098, \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ub2e8\ud3b8\ud654\uc640 \uae30\uc874 LLM\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5 \uc218\ud589\uc758 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc804\ubb38 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc138\ud2b8\uc778 \uac80\uc0c9 \uc99d\ub300, \uc6f9 \uac80\uc0c9 \ubc0f \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\uc815 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 ESGAgent\ub77c\ub294 \ub2e4\uacc4\uce35 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "ESGAgent\ub294 \uc6d0\uc790 \uc9c8\ubb38-\uc751\ub2f5 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c 84.15%\uc758 \ud3c9\uade0 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub85c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ub2eb\ud78c \uc18c\uc2a4 LLM\ub4e4\uc744 \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\uba70, \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \ub3c4\ud45c\uc640 \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ucc38\uc870\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc804\ubb38 \ubcf4\uace0\uc11c \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub118\ub294\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc758 \uc9c4\ub2e8 \uac00\uce58\ub97c \ud655\uc778\ud558\uace0, \uace0\uc704\ud5d8 \uc218\uc9c1 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uace0\uae09 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud544\uc218 \uc2dc\ud5d8\ub300 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud658\uacbd, \uc0ac\ud68c \ubc0f \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4(ESG) \uae30\uc900\uc740 \uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \uc9c0\uc18d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uacfc \uc724\ub9ac\uc801 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc804\ubb38\uc801\uc778 ESG \ubd84\uc11d\uc740 \ube44\uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc18c\uc2a4\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \ubd84\uc0b0\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \ucca0\uc800\ud55c \uac10\uc0ac\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud558\uace0 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4\uc758 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac80\uc0c9 \uc99d\ub300, \uc6f9 \uac80\uc0c9 \ubc0f \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\uc815 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \uc804\ubb38 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc138\ud2b8\ub85c \uac15\ud654\ub41c \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc778 ESGAgent\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc644\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 310\uac1c\uc758 \uae30\uc5c5 \uc9c0\uc18d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \ubcf4\uace0\uc11c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud30c\uc0dd\ub41c \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 3\ub2e8\uacc4 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc6d0\uc790\uc801 \uc0c1\uc2dd \uc9c8\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c \ud1b5\ud569\ub41c \uc2ec\uce35 \ubd84\uc11d \uc0dd\uc131\uc5d0 \uc774\ub974\uae30\uae4c\uc9c0 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\uc99d\uc801 \ud3c9\uac00 \uacb0\uacfc, ESGAgent\ub294 \uc6d0\uc790 \uc9c8\ubb38-\uc751\ub2f5 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uade0 84.15%\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub85c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ub2eb\ud78c \uc18c\uc2a4 LLM\ub4e4\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\uba70, \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \ucc28\ud2b8\uc640 \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ucc38\uc870\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc804\ubb38 \ubcf4\uace0\uc11c \uc0dd\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uac00 \uc9c4\ub2e8 \uac00\uce58\ub97c \ud655\uc778\ud558\uba70, \uace0\uc704\ud5d8 \uc218\uc9c1 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\ubc18 \ubc0f \uace0\uae09 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud544\uc218 \uc2dc\ud5d8\ub300 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud655\ub9bd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, personalized information can be a double-edged sword: it can improve interaction but may compromise objectivity and factual correctness, especially when it is misaligned with the question. To alleviate this problem, we propose PersonaDual, a framework that supports both general-purpose objective reasoning and personalized reasoning in a single model, and adaptively switches modes based on context. PersonaDual is first trained with SFT to learn two reasoning patterns, and then further optimized via reinforcement learning with our proposed DualGRPO to improve mode selection.

We introduce Cago (Capability-Aware Goal Sampling), a novel learning-from-demonstrations method that mitigates the brittle dependence on expert trajectories for direct imitation. Unlike prior methods that rely on demonstrations only for policy initialization or reward shaping, Cago dynamically tracks the agent's competence along expert trajectories and uses this signal to select intermediate steps--goals that are just beyond the agent's current reach--to guide learning. This results in an adaptive curriculum that enables steady progress toward solving the full task. Empirical results demonstrate that Cago significantly improves sample efficiency and final performance across a range of sparse-reward, goal-conditioned tasks, consistently outperforming existing learning from-demonstrations baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "Cago\ub294 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uacbd\ub85c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \uc904\uc5ec \uc7a5\uae30 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubaa8\ubc29 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc7a5\uae30 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubaa8\ubc29 \ud559\uc2b5\uc774 \uc2e4\uc81c\ub85c \ubd88\uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc644\ubcbd\ud55c \uc2dc\uc5f0 \ubcf5\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "Cago\ub294 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \ub530\ub77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\uc801\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud604\uc7ac \ub3c4\ub2ec \ubc94\uc704\ub97c \ub118\uc5b4\uc120 \uc911\uac04 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\uc5ec \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc548\ub0b4\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774\ub2e4.", "result": "Cago\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud76c\uc18c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc870\uc815 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \ucd5c\uc885 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uae30\uc874 \ubaa8\ubc29 \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc95\ub4e4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud558\uba70, \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc9c4\ud589\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ucee4\ub9ac\ud058\ub7fc\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ube44\ub85d \ubaa8\ubc29 \ud559\uc2b5\uc774 \uc720\ub9dd\ud558\uae34 \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc644\ubcbd\ud55c \uc2dc\uc5f0 \ubcf5\uc81c\uac00 \ube44\ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \uc7a5\uae30 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc791\uc740 \uc624\ucc28\uac00 \ub204\uc801\ub418\uc5b4 \uce58\uba85\uc801\uc778 \uc2e4\ud328\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uacbd\ub85c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucde8\uc57d\ud55c \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc2dc\uc5f0 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 Cago(\ub2a5\ub825 \uc778\uc2dd \ubaa9\ud45c \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1)\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

To compare these techniques and select the best one for deployment, the community depends on public benchmarks and their leaderboards. Since these benchmarks heavily rely on human annotations during question construction and answer evaluation, the validity of the annotations is crucial.\n  In this paper, we conduct an empirical study that (i) benchmarks annotation error rates for two widely used text-to-SQL benchmarks, BIRD and Spider 2.0-Snow, and (ii) corrects a subset of the BIRD development (Dev) set to measure the impact of annotation errors on text-to-SQL agent performance and leaderboard rankings. Through expert analysis, we show that BIRD Mini-Dev and Spider 2.0-Snow have error rates of 52.8% and 62.8%, respectively. We re-evaluate all 16 open-source agents from the BIRD leaderboard on both the original and the corrected BIRD Dev subsets. We show that performance changes range from -7% to 31% (in relative terms) and rank changes range from $-9$ to $+9$ positions. We further assess whether these impacts generalize to the full BIRD Dev set. We find that the rankings of agents on the uncorrected subset correlate strongly with those on the full Dev set (Spearman's $r_s$=0.85, $p$=3.26e-5), whereas they correlate weakly with those on the corrected subset (Spearman's $r_s$=0.32, $p$=0.23). These findings show that annotation errors can significantly distort reported performance and rankings, potentially misguiding research directions or deployment choices.
