In this context, constructing high-quality\nanti-money laundering(AML) datasets has become essential for risk-control\nsystems and on-chain forensic analysis, yet current practices still rely\nheavily on manual efforts with limited efficiency and coverage. In this paper,\nwe introduce RiskTagger, a large-language-model-based agent for the automatic\nannotation of crypto laundering behaviors in Web3. RiskTagger is designed to\nreplace or complement human annotators by addressing three key challenges:\nextracting clues from complex unstructured reports, reasoning over multichain\ntransaction paths, and producing auditor-friendly explanations. RiskTagger\nimplements an end-to-end multi-module agent, integrating a key-clue extractor,\na multichain fetcher with a laundering-behavior reasoner, and a data explainer,\nforming a data annotation pipeline. Experiments on the real case Bybit Hack\n(with the highest stolen asset value) demonstrate that RiskTagger achieves 100%\naccuracy in clue extraction, 84.1% consistency with expert judgment, and 90%\ncoverage in explanation generation. Overall, RiskTagger automates laundering\nbehavior annotation while improving transparency and scalability in AML\nresearch.", "AI": {"tldr": "Web3\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \ud0c8\uc911\uc559\ud654 \uae08\uc735\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uae08 \uc138\ud0c1 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc8fc\uc11d \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c RiskTagger\ub77c\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud0c8\uc911\uc559\ud654 \uae08\uc735\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc775\uba85\uc131\uacfc \ud06c\ub85c\uc2a4 \uccb4\uc778 \uc790\uc0b0 \ud750\ub984\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc628\uccb4\uc778 \uc790\uae08 \uc138\ud0c1 \ud589\ub3d9\uc774 \ub354\uc6b1 \uc740\ubc00\ud558\uace0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud574\uc84c\ub2e4.", "method": "RiskTagger\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ube44\uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ubcf4\uace0\uc11c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e8\uc11c\ub97c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\uace0, \ub2e4\uc911 \uccb4\uc778 \uac70\ub798 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \ucd94\ub860\ud558\uba70, \uac10\uc0ac\uc790 \uce5c\ud654\uc801\uc778 \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub4f1 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd98 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc774\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, RiskTagger\ub294 \ub2e8\uc11c \ucd94\ucd9c\uc5d0\uc11c 100% \uc815\ud655\ub3c4, \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \ud310\ub2e8\uacfc\uc758 \uc77c\uad00\uc131 84.1%, \uc124\uba85 \uc0dd\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c 90% \ucee4\ubc84\ub9ac\uc9c0\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "RiskTagger\ub294 \uc790\uae08 \uc138\ud0c1 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc8fc\uc11d \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud558\uba70 AML \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \ud22c\uba85\uc131\uacfc \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "Web3\uc758 \uae09\uc18d\ud55c \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \ud0c8\uc911\uc559\ud654 \uae08\uc735\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\uc600\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc775\uba85\uc131\uacfc \ud06c\ub85c\uc2a4 \uccb4\uc778 \uc790\uc0b0 \ud750\ub984\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc628\uccb4\uc778 \uc790\uae08 \uc138\ud0c1 \ud589\ub3d9\uc774 \ub354 \uc740\ubc00\ud558\uace0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud558\uac8c \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0\uc11c \uace0\ud488\uc9c8\uc758 \uc790\uae08 \uc138\ud0c1 \ubc29\uc9c0(AML) \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc704\ud5d8 \uad00\ub9ac \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ubc0f \uc628\uccb4\uc778 \ud3ec\ub80c\uc2dd \ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uad00\ud589\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \ubc94\uc704\ub85c \uc218\ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \ub178\ub825\uc5d0 \ud06c\uac8c \uc758\uc874\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 Web3\uc5d0\uc11c \uc554\ud638\ud654 \uc790\uae08 \uc138\ud0c1 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc8fc\uc11d \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc778 RiskTagger\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.

With our proposed\nFCV-Attack, which can be deliberately crafted by malicious attackers or\nimplicitly introduced by benign developers, we show that SOTA LLMs (e.g.,\nChatGPT and Claude) and agent scaffolds (e.g., SWE-agent and OpenHands) are all\nvulnerable to this FCV threat; across 12 agent-model combinations on SWE-Bench,\nthe attack only requires black-box access and a single query to the code agent\nto perform the attack. For example, for CWE-538 (information exposure\nvulnerability), the FCV-Attack attains an attack success rate of $40.7\\%$ on\nGPT-5 Mini + OpenHands.

While LLM\ncapabilities continue to improve, they remain increasingly susceptible to\njailbreaking, especially in multi-turn scenarios where harmful intent can be\nsubtly injected across the conversation to produce nefarious outcomes. While\nsingle-turn attacks have been extensively explored, adaptability, efficiency\nand effectiveness continue to remain key challenges for their multi-turn\ncounterparts. To address these gaps, we present PLAGUE, a novel plug-and-play\nframework for designing multi-turn attacks inspired by lifelong-learning\nagents. PLAGUE dissects the lifetime of a multi-turn attack into three\ncarefully designed phases (Primer, Planner and Finisher) that enable a\nsystematic and information-rich exploration of the multi-turn attack family.\nEvaluations show that red-teaming agents designed using PLAGUE achieve\nstate-of-the-art jailbreaking results, improving attack success rates (ASR) by\nmore than 30% across leading models in a lesser or comparable query budget.\nParticularly, PLAGUE enables an ASR (based on StrongReject) of 81.4% on\nOpenAI's o3 and 67.3% on Claude's Opus 4.1, two models that are considered\nhighly resistant to jailbreaks in safety literature.

This\npaper introduces TACLA (Transactional Analysis Contextual LLM-based Agents), a\nnovel Multi-Agent architecture designed to overcome these limitations. TACLA\nintegrates core principles of Transactional Analysis (TA) by modeling agents as\nan orchestrated system of distinct Parent, Adult, and Child ego states, each\nwith its own pattern memory.

We introduce\nGRETEL, to address this gap through systematic empirical validation. GRETEL\nimplements an agentic workflow that processes semantically retrieved candidates\nthrough sandboxed plan-execute-evaluate cycles, generating execution-grounded\nevidence to distinguish truly functional tools from merely descriptive matches.\nOur comprehensive evaluation on the ToolBench benchmark demonstrates\nsubstantial improvements across all metrics: Pass Rate (at 10) increases from\n0.690 to 0.826, Recall (at 10) improves from 0.841 to 0.867, and NDCG (at 10)\nrises from 0.807 to 0.857..

Accepted for presentation at the 5th Workshop on\n  Mathematical Reasoning and AI at NeurIPS 2025", "summary": "Inference-time computation is a critical yet challenging paradigm for\nenhancing the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs). While\nexisting strategies improve reasoning stability and consistency, they suffer\nfrom notable limitations: self-correction often reinforces the model's initial\nbiases, and Multi-Agent Collaboration (MAC) often fails due to the lack of\nefficient coordination mechanisms, leading to collective errors. Although\nhigh-performing verifiers can detect reasoning errors, making them reliable\nrequires substantial training. To address these challenges, we introduce a\nnovel inference-time framework, Adaptive Coopetition (AdCo), in which LLM\nagents utilize an adaptive, UCB-based \"coopetition\" mechanism. At each round,\nagents leverage coarse verifier signals to determine whether to collaborate or\ncompete, and iteratively refine their reasoning based on peer feedback. Without\nrelying on high-performance verifiers, our adaptive strategy achieves\nsignificant performance gains on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, yielding a\n20% relative improvement over baselines on the more challenging dataset. Our\napproach remains robust and consistent in terms of accuracy under different\nsample sizes and configurations. This adaptive, signal-guided \"coopetition\"\nframework enhances reasoning robustness by leveraging both model knowledge\ndiversity and reasoning trace measures, while also promoting uncertainty-driven\nexploration, especially when participants have comparable capabilities. From\nthis perspective, our work offers a fresh lens on inference-time computation\nand paves the way for more resilient multi-agent LLM systems.

To enhance complex reasoning, multi-agent\nsystems have been proposed to harness the collective intelligence of LLM\nagents. However, existing collaboration structures are either predefined or\nrely on majority voting or round-table debates, which can suppress correct but\nless dominant agent contributions. Recent approaches model multi-agent systems\nas graph networks but optimize purely for agent performance, neglecting the\nquality of interactions. We hypothesize that effective agent communication is\ncrucial for multi-agent reasoning and that debating quality plays a significant\nrole. To address this, we propose $\\ours$, a multi-agent verbal reinforcement\nlearning algorithm that dynamically constructs and refines multi-agent\ncollaboration structures.

Yet constructing generalizable synthetic verifiable\ndata remains difficult due to hallucination-prone generation, and weak or\ntrivial verification artifacts that fail to separate strong from weak\nsolutions. Existing approaches often rely on task-specific heuristics or\npost-hoc filters that do not transfer across domains and lack a principled,\nuniversal evaluator of verifiability. In this work, we introduce an\nevolutionary, task-agnostic, strategy-guided, executably-checkable data\nsynthesis framework that, from minimal seed supervision, jointly synthesizes\nproblems, diverse candidate solutions, and verification artifacts, and\niteratively discovers strategies via a consistency-based evaluator that\nenforces agreement between human-annotated and strategy-induced checks. This\npipeline upgrades filtering into principled synthesis: it reliably assembles\ncoherent, verifiable training instances and generalizes without domain-specific\nrules. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach\nunder both RLVR and model distillation training paradigms. The results show\nthat training with our synthesized data yields significant improvements on both\nthe LiveCodeBench and AgentBench-OS tasks, highlighting the robust\ngeneralization of our

In this paper, we\npresent the first study that investigates the impact of dark patterns on the\ndecision-making process of LLM-based generalist web agents. To achieve this, we\nintroduce LiteAgent, a lightweight framework that automatically prompts agents\nto execute tasks while capturing comprehensive logs and screen-recordings of\ntheir interactions. We also present TrickyArena, a controlled environment\ncomprising web applications from domains such as e-commerce, streaming\nservices, and news platforms, each containing diverse and realistic dark\npatterns that can be selectively enabled or disabled. Using LiteAgent and\nTrickyArena, we conduct multiple experiments to assess the impact of both\nindividual and combined dark patterns on web agent behavior. We evaluate six\npopular LLM-based generalist web agents across three LLMs and discover that\nwhen there is a single dark pattern present, agents are susceptible to it an\naverage of 41% of the time. We also find that modifying dark pattern UI\nattributes through visual design changes or HTML code adjustments and\nintroducing multiple dark patterns simultaneously can influence agent\nsusceptibility. This study emphasizes the need for holistic defense mechanisms\nin web agents, encompassing both agent-specific protections and broader web\nsafety measures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8

In our setting, agents\nare unsupervised and have no explicit rewards or learning objectives but\ninstead evolve over time according to reproduction, mutation, and natural\nselection. As they act, agents also shape their environment and the population\naround them in an ongoing dynamic ecology. Our goal is not to optimize a single\nhigh-performance policy, but instead to examine how behaviors emerge and evolve\nacross large populations due to natural competition and environmental\npressures. In an effort to discover how complex behaviors naturally emerge, we\nconduct experiments in large-scale worlds that reach populations of more than\n60,000 individual agents, each with their own evolved neural network policy. We\nidentify various emergent behaviors such as long-range resource extraction,\nvision-based foraging, and predation that arise under competitive and survival\npressures. We examine how sensing modalities and environmental scale affect the\nemergence of these behaviors, finding that some appear only in sufficiently\nlarge environments and populations, with larger scales increasing behavioral\nstability and consistency. While there is a rich history of research in\nevolutionary settings, our scaling results provide promising new directions to\nexplore ecology as an instrument of machine learning in an era of abundant\ncomputational resources.

While deep learning has recently advanced the\nstate-of-the-art in the time series forecasting literature, its application to\nneural activity forecasting remains limited. To bridge this gap, we\nsystematically evaluated eight probabilistic deep learning models, including\ntwo foundation models, that have demonstrated strong performance on general\nforecasting benchmarks. We compared them against four classical statistical\nmodels and two baseline methods on spontaneous neural activity recorded from\nmouse cortex via widefield imaging. Across prediction horizons, several deep\nlearning models consistently outperformed classical approaches, with the best\nmodel producing informative forecasts up to 1.5 seconds into the future.

Unlike traditional RAN\nwhere the RAN data and its usage is restricted within proprietary and\nmonolithic RAN equipment, the O-RAN architecture opens up access to RAN data\nvia RAN intelligent controllers (RICs), to third-party machine learning (ML)\npowered applications - rApps and xApps - to optimize RAN operations.\nConsequently, a major focus has been placed on leveraging RAN data to unlock\ngreater efficiency gains. However, there is an increasing recognition that RAN\ndata access to apps could become a source of vulnerability and be exploited by\nmalicious actors. Motivated by this, we carry out a comprehensive investigation\nof data vulnerabilities on both xApps and rApps, respectively hosted in Near-\nand Non-real-time (RT) RIC components of O-RAN. We qualitatively analyse the\nO-RAN security mechanisms and limitations for xApps and rApps, and consider a\nthreat model informed by this analysis. We design a viable and effective\nblack-box evasion attack strategy targeting O-RAN RIC Apps while accounting for\nthe stringent timing constraints and attack effectiveness. The strategy employs\nfour key techniques: the model cloning algorithm, input-specific perturbations,\nuniversal adversarial perturbations (UAPs), and targeted UAPs. This strategy\ntargets ML models used by both xApps and rApps within the O-RAN system, aiming\nto degrade network performance. We validate the effectiveness of the designed\nevasion attack strategy and quantify the scale of performance degradation using\na real-world O-RAN testbed and emulation environments. Evaluation is conducted\nusing the Interference Classification xApp and the Power Saving rApp as\nrepresentatives for near-RT and non-RT RICs. We also show that the attack\nstrategy is effective against prominent defense techniques for adversarial ML.", "AI": {"tldr": "O-RAN \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub294 RAN \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc811\uadfc\uc744 \uac1c\ubc29\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc18 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 RAN \uc6b4\uc601\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc811\uadfc\uc740 \uc545\uc758\uc801\uc778 \uacf5\uaca9\uc790\uc5d0 \uc758\ud55c \ubcf4\uc548 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 xApps\uc640 rApps\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uace0, O-RAN RIC \uc571\uc744 \uaca8\ub0e5\ud55c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 \ud68c\ud53c \uacf5\uaca9 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uc5ec \uc131\ub2a5 \uc800\ud558\ub97c \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "motivation": "O-RAN\uc758 \ucc44\ud0dd\uc774 \uc9c4\ud589\ub428\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c RAN \uc6b4\uc601\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18 \ud601\uc2e0 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.

While supervised fine-tuning can help bridge\nthis performance gap, it requires substantial manual effort in data preparation\nand iterative optimization. We present PaDA-Agent (Pattern-guided Data\nAugmentation Agent), an evaluation-driven approach that streamlines the data\naugmentation process for SLMs through coordinated operations. Unlike\nstate-of-the-art approaches that focus on model training errors only and\ngenerating error-correcting samples, PaDA-Agent discovers failure patterns from\nthe validation data via evaluations and drafts targeted data augmentation\nstrategies aiming to directly reduce the generalization gap.

Achieving this requires sim agent policies that are human-like,\nfast, and scalable in multi-agent settings. Recent progress in imitation\nlearning with large diffusion-based or tokenized models has shown that\nbehaviors can be captured directly from human driving data, producing realistic\npolicies. However, these models are computationally expensive, slow during\ninference, and struggle to adapt in reactive, closed-loop scenarios. In\ncontrast, self-play reinforcement learning (RL) scales efficiently and\nnaturally captures multi-agent interactions, but it often relies on heuristics\nand reward shaping, and the resulting policies can diverge from human norms. We\npropose SPACeR, a framework that leverages a pretrained tokenized\nautoregressive motion model as a centralized reference policy to guide\ndecentralized self-play. The reference model provides likelihood rewards and KL\ndivergence, anchoring policies to the human driving distribution while\npreserving RL scalability. Evaluated on the Waymo Sim Agents Challenge, our\nmethod achieves competitive performance with imitation-learned policies while\nbeing up to 10x faster at inference and 50x smaller in parameter size than\nlarge generative models. In addition, we demonstrate in closed-loop ego\nplanning evaluation tasks that our sim agents can effectively measure planner\nquality with fast and scalable traffic simulation, establishing a new paradigm\nfor testing autonomous driving policies.", "AI": {"tldr": "SPACeR\ub294 \uc120\ud589 \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \ud1a0\ud070\ud654\ub41c \uc790\uac00 \ud68c\uadc0 \ubaa8\uc158 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc911\uc559\uc9d1\uc911\uc2dd \ucc38\uc870 \uc815\ucc45\uc73c\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc790\uac00 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\ub97c \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc790\uc728\uc8fc\ud589\ucc28 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc740 \uc548\uc804\uc131, \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\uc2dd \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc778\uac04\uacfc \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "SPACeR \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc120\ud589 \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \ud1a0\ud070\ud654\ub41c \uc790\uac00 \ud68c\uadc0 \ubaa8\uc158 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ucc38\uc870 \uc815\ucc45\uc73c\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc790\uac00 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\ub97c \uc720\ub3c4\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "Waymo Sim Agents Challenge\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ubaa8\ubc29 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc815\ucc45\uacfc \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc73c\uba70, \ucd94\ub860 \uc18d\ub3c4\ub294 \ucd5c\ub300 10\ubc30 \ube60\ub974\uace0, \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \ud06c\uae30\ub294 50\ubc30 \uc791\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ube60\ub974\uace0 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uad50\ud1b5 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uacc4\ud68d\uc790 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uce21\uc815\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc790\uc728\uc8fc\ud589 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \ud655\ub9bd\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc790\uc728\uc8fc\ud589\ucc28(AV)\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\ub824\uba74 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uacfc \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\ubfd0 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uc778\uc2dd\uc774 \uc788\uace0 \uc608\uce21 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc778\uac04\uacfc \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9\ub3c4 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub824\uba74 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uac04\uacfc \uc720\uc0ac\ud558\uace0 \ube60\ub974\uba70 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc815\ucc45\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ud655\uc0b0 \uae30\ubc18 \ub610\ub294 \ud1a0\ud070\ud654\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c \ubaa8\ubc29 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc9c4\uc804\uc740 \ud589\ub3d9\uc774 \uc778\uac04 \uc6b4\uc804 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc9c1\uc811 \ucea1\ucc98\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5b4 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud588\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4e4\uace0 \ucd94\ub860 \uc911 \ub290\ub9ac\uba70 \ubc18\uc751\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud3d0\uc1c4 \ub8e8\ud504 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uc801\uc751\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\ub294\ub2e4. \ubc18\uba74\uc5d0 \uc790\uac00 \ud559\uc2b5 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc740 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ub418\uba70 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7fd\uac8c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc885\uc885 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1\uacfc \ubcf4\uc0c1 shaping\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uba70 \uacb0\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc815\ucc45\uc740 \uc778\uac04 \uaddc\ubc94\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc97\uc5b4\ub0a0 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 SPACeR\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\ub294\ub370, \uc774\ub294 \uc0ac\uc804\uc5d0 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ud1a0\ud070\ud654\ub41c \uc790\uac00 \ud68c\uadc0 \ubaa8\uc158 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uc911\uc2dd \ucc38\uc870 \uc815\ucc45\uc73c\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc790\uac00 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc548\ub0b4\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4. \ucc38\uc870 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc778\uac04 \uc6b4\uc804 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc5d0 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uace0\uc815\ud558\uba74\uc11c RL \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uac00\ub2a5\ub3c4 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uacfc KL \ubc1c\uc0b0\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.

The\nframework equips agents with multimodal perception (vision and text) and\nstructured action capabilities, enabling physical manipulation and grounded\nmultimodal communication (e.g., text with visual pointers). M-S2L combines\ndirect reinforcement learning with two novel social learning pathways:\nmultimodal observational learning and communication-driven learning from\nfeedback, augmented by an episodic memory system for long-term social context.\n  We evaluate M-S2L in a Collaborative Assembly Environment (CAE), where agent\nteams must construct complex devices from ambiguous blueprints under\ninformational asymmetry. Across tasks of increasing complexity, M-S2L agents\nconsistently outperform Text-Only and No-Social-Learning baselines in Task\nCompletion Rate and Time to Completion, particularly in dynamic problem-solving\nscenarios. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of both multimodality and\nsocialized learning. Our analysis reveals the emergence of efficient\ncommunication protocols integrating visual pointers with concise text,\nalongside rapid role specialization leading to stable labor division.\nQualitative case studies demonstrate agents' abilities for shared awareness,\ndynamic re-planning, and adaptive problem-solving, suggesting a nascent form of\nmachine social cognition. These findings indicate that integrating multimodal\nperception with explicit social learning is critical for developing human-like\ncollaborative intelligence in multi-agent systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "M-S2L \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uc9c0\ub2a5 \ubc1c\ub2ec\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 emergent social intelligence\ub97c \uc99d\uc9c4\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "M-S2L\uc740 \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \uc9c0\uac01 \ubc0f \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ud589\ub3d9 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc778 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uacfc \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "M-S2L \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc7a5\uce58\ub97c \uc124\uacc4\ud558\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \uc9c0\uac01\uacfc \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc778 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ud1b5\ud569\uc774 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uac04\uacfc \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \ud611\uc5c5 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(M-LLMs)\uacfc \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 emergent social intelligence\ub97c \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c(M-S2L)\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \uc9c0\uac01(\ube44\uc804 \ubc0f \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8)\uacfc \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ud589\ub3d9 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubd80\uc5ec\ud558\uc5ec \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc870\uc791 \ubc0f \uae30\ubc18\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ucf00\uc774\uc158(\uc608: \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \ud3ec\uc778\ud130\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8)\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, post-event\nanalyses and rule-based agent-based models (ABMs) struggle to capture the\ncomplexity of human behavior and social interaction. We introduce an\nLLM-powered multi-agent simulation framework that models consumer decisions and\nsocial dynamics. Building on recent advances in large language model simulation\nin a sandbox environment, our framework enables generative agents to interact,\nexpress internal reasoning, form habits, and make purchasing decisions without\npredefined rules. In a price-discount marketing scenario, the system delivers\nactionable strategy-testing outcomes and reveals emergent social patterns\nbeyond the reach of conventional methods.

While regularization-based\nmethods have recently achieved last-iteration convergence to a regularized\nequilibrium, they require the regularization strength to shrink toward zero to\napproximate a Nash equilibrium, often leading to unstable learning in practice.\nInstead, we fix the regularization strength at a large value for robustness and\nachieve convergence by iteratively refining the reference policy. Our main\ntheoretical result shows that this procedure guarantees strictly monotonic\nimprovement and convergence to an exact Nash equilibrium in two-player zero-sum\ngames, without requiring a uniqueness assumption. Building on this framework,\nwe develop a practical algorithm, Nash Policy Gradient (NashPG), which\npreserves the generalizability of policy gradient methods while relying solely\non the current and reference policies.

We\nintroduce and empirically validate the Trust-Vulnerability Paradox (TVP):\nincreasing inter-agent trust to enhance coordination simultaneously expands\nrisks of over-exposure and over-authorization. To investigate this paradox, we\nconstruct a scenario-game dataset spanning 3 macro scenes and 19 sub-scenes,\nand run extensive closed-loop interactions with trust explicitly parameterized.\nUsing Minimum Necessary Information (MNI) as the safety baseline, we propose\ntwo unified metrics: Over-Exposure Rate (OER) to detect boundary violations,\nand Authorization Drift (AD) to capture sensitivity to trust levels. Results\nacross multiple model backends and orchestration frameworks reveal consistent\ntrends: higher trust improves task success but also heightens exposure risks,\nwith heterogeneous trust-to-risk mappings across systems. We further examine\ndefenses such as Sensitive Information Repartitioning and Guardian-Agent\nenablement, both of which reduce OER and attenuate AD. Overall, this study\nformalizes TVP, establishes reproducible baselines with unified metrics, and\ndemonstrates that trust must be modeled and scheduled as a first-class security\nvariable in

We present\na novel, multi-layered solution built on a decentralized foundation of on-chain\nblockchain services for verifiable identity, discovery, and transactions. This\nis complemented by a comprehensive development framework for creating secure,\ninteroperable agents, a cloud-based platform for deployment, and an intelligent\norchestration layer where an agent-native LLM translates high-level human goals\ninto complex, multi-agent workflows. We demonstrate the deployed nature of this\nsystem through a decentralized logistics use case where autonomous agents\ndynamically discover, negotiate, and transact with one another securely.\nUltimately, the Fetch.ai stack provides a principled architecture for moving\nbeyond current agent implementations towards open, collaborative, and\neconomically sustainable multi-agent ecosystems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Fetch.ai \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub294 \uc911\uc559\uc9d1\uc911\ud654\uc640 \uc2e0\ub8b0 \ubc0f \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c \ubd80\uc871\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uace0\uc548\ub41c \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ucd5c\uadfc\uc758 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc9c0\ub2a5\ud615 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ub2e4\uc218\uc758 \uc804\ubb38 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(MAS) \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uac04\uacfc\ud558\uc5ec \ub9ce\uc740 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uc9c0\ub2c8\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud074\ub798\uc2dd MAS \uc6d0\uce59\uacfc \ud604\ub300 AI \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uce35\uc801 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc740 \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc2e0\uc6d0\uacfc \uac70\ub798\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc628\uccb4\uc778 \ube14\ub85d\uccb4\uc778 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud0c8\uc911\uc559\ud654\ub41c \ubb3c\ub958 \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uc0ac\ub840\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc774 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc548\uc804\ud558\uac8c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac70\ub798\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Fetch.ai \uc2a4\ud0dd\uc740 \uc5f4\ub9b0 \ud611\ub825\uc801\uc774\uba70 \uacbd\uc81c\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c0\uc18d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub2e4\uc218\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc0dd\ud0dc\uacc4\ub85c \ub098\uc544\uac08 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc6d0\uce59 \uae30\ubc18 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc9c0\ub2a5\ud615 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uae09\uc99d\uc740 \uc218\uc2ed \ub144 \uac04\uc758 \uae30\ucd08\uc801\uc778 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(MAS) \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uac04\uacfc\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc911\uc559\uc9d1\uc911\ud654 \ubc0f \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc640 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc758 \ubd80\uc871\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 MAS \uc6d0\uce59\uacfc \ud604\ub300 AI \uae30\ub2a5\uc758 \ud1b5\ud569\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc0b0\uc5c5 \uac15\ub3c4\uc758 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc778 Fetch.ai \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc2e0\uc6d0, \ubc1c\uacac \ubc0f \uac70\ub798\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc628\uccb4\uc778 \ube14\ub85d\uccb4\uc778 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc758 \ud0c8\uc911\uc559\ud654\ub41c \ud1a0\ub300\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\ucd95\ub41c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub2e4\uce35\uc801 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc548\uc804\ud558\uace0 \uc0c1\ud638\uc6b4\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ub9cc\ub4e4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \uac1c\ubc1c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c, \ubc30\ud3ec\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc \uae30\ubc18 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubcf8\ub798\uc758 LLM\uc774 \uace0\uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc778\uac04 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud750\ub984\uc73c\ub85c \ubc88\uc5ed\ud558\ub294 \uc9c0\ub2a5\ud615 \uc624\ucf00\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uacc4\uce35\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\uc644\ub41c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc11c\ub85c \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uace0 \ud611\uc0c1\ud558\uba70 \uc548\uc804\ud558\uac8c \uac70\ub798\ud558\ub294 \ud0c8\uc911\uc559\ud654\ub41c \ubb3c\ub958 \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uc0ac\ub840\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ubc30\ud3ec\ub41c \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4. \uad81\uadf9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c Fetch.ai \uc2a4\ud0dd\uc740 \ud604\uc7ac \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uad6c\ud604\uc744 \ub118\uc5b4 \uac1c\ubc29\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud611\ub825\uc801\uc774\uba70 \uacbd\uc81c\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c0\uc18d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub2e4\uc218\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc0dd\ud0dc\uacc4\ub85c \ub098\uc544\uac00\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc6d0\uce59 \uae30\ubc18 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

However,\nthe performance of DLMs on code generation tasks, which have stronger\nstructural constraints, is significantly hampered by the critical trade-off\nbetween inference speed and output quality. We observed that accelerating the\ncode generation process by reducing the number of sampling steps usually leads\nto a catastrophic collapse in performance. In this paper, we introduce\nefficient Sampling with Adaptive acceleration and Backtracking Enhanced\nRemasking (i.e., Saber), a novel training-free sampling algorithm for DLMs to\nachieve better inference speed and output quality in code generation.\nSpecifically, Saber is motivated by two key insights in the DLM generation\nprocess: 1) it can be adaptively accelerated as more of the code context is\nestablished; 2) it requires a backtracking mechanism to reverse the generated\ntokens. Extensive experiments on multiple mainstream code generation benchmarks\nshow that Saber boosts Pass@1 accuracy by an average improvement of 1.9% over\nmainstream DLM sampling methods, meanwhile achieving an average 251.4%\ninference speedup. By leveraging the inherent advantages of DLMs, our work\nsignificantly narrows the performance gap with autoregressive models in code\ngeneration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \ubc0f \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc778 Saber\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "Diffusion language models(DLMs)\ub294 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc81c\uc57d\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ucd94\ub860 \uc18d\ub3c4\uc640 \ucd9c\ub825 \ud488\uc9c8 \uac04\uc758 \uc911\ub300\ud55c \uade0\ud615 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "Saber\ub294 \ucf54\ub4dc \ub9e5\ub77d\uc774 \ud655\ub9bd\ub420\uc218\ub85d \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ub418\uace0, \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \ud1a0\ud070\uc744 \ub418\ub3cc\ub9ac\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubc31\ud2b8\ub798\ud0b9 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ube44\ud559\uc2b5 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "Saber\ub294 \uc8fc\ub958 DLM \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ud3c9\uade0 1.9%\uc758 Pass@1 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub192\uc774\uace0, \ud3c9\uade0 251.4%\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \uc18d\ub3c4 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 DLM\uc758 \uace0\uc720\ud55c \uc7a5\uc810\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uae30 \ud68c\uadc0 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud06c\uac8c \uc904\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud655\uc0b0 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(DLMs)\uc740 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcd1\ub82c \uc0dd\uc131 \ubc0f \uc591\ubc29\ud5a5 \ubb38\ub9e5 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc5d0\uc11c \uc7a5\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uc9c0\ubc30\uc801\uc778 \uc790\uae30 \ud68c\uadc0 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud558\uace0 \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \ub300\uc548\uc73c\ub85c \ubd80\uc0c1\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ub354 \uac15\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc81c\uc57d\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c DLM\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc740 \ucd94\ub860 \uc18d\ub3c4\uc640 \ucd9c\ub825 \ud488\uc9c8 \uc0ac\uc774\uc758 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uade0\ud615 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \uc800\ud574\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub97c \uc904\uc5ec \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud558\uba74 \ubcf4\ud1b5 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uae09\uaca9\ud788 \uc800\ud558\ub41c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uad00\ucc30\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \ucd94\ub860 \uc18d\ub3c4\uc640 \ucd9c\ub825 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 DLM\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc778 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uacfc \uc801\uc751 \uac00\uc18d \ubc0f \ubc31\ud2b8\ub798\ud0b9 \ud5a5\uc0c1 \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud0b9(\uc989, Saber)\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c Saber\ub294 DLM \uc0dd\uc131 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud575\uc2ec \ud1b5\ucc30\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ub3d9\uae30\ub97c \ubd80\uc5ec\ubc1b\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4: 1) \ucf54\ub4dc \ubb38\ub9e5\uc774 \ub354 \ud655\ub9bd\ub420\uc218\ub85d \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4; 2) \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \ud1a0\ud070\uc744 \ub418\ub3cc\ub9ac\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubc31\ud2b8\ub798\ud0b9 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc8fc\ub958 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 Saber\ub294 \uc8fc\ub958 DLM \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ud3c9\uade0 1.9% \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub41c Pass@1 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub192\uc774\ub294 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ud3c9\uade0 251.4%\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \uc18d\ub3c4 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Sparse autoencoders\n(SAEs) make hidden activations more interpretable by exposing latent features\nthat often align with human concepts. Yet, these features are fragile and\npassive, offering no mechanism for systematic reasoning or model control. To\naddress this, we introduce ActivationReasoning (AR), a framework that embeds\nexplicit logical reasoning into the latent space of LLMs. It proceeds in three\nstages: (1) Finding latent representations, first latent concept\nrepresentations are identified (e.g., via SAEs) and organized into a\ndictionary; (2) Activating propositions, at inference time AR detects\nactivating concepts and maps them to logical propositions; and (3)Logical\nreasoning, applying logical rules over these propositions to infer higher-order\nstructures, compose new concepts, and steer model behavior. We evaluate AR on\nmulti-hop reasoning (PrOntoQA), abstraction and robustness to indirect concept\ncues (Rail2Country), reasoning over natural and diverse language (ProverQA),\nand context-sensitive safety (BeaverTails). Across all tasks, AR scales\nrobustly with reasoning complexity, generalizes to abstract and\ncontext-sensitive tasks, and transfers across model backbones.

We\ntested various LLMs, including Gemini 1.5 Flash and GPT-4o mini, to build these\nagents and found that Gemini 1.5 Flash achieved the best performance with an F1\nscore of 83.01% on a newly curated dataset. Also, the system maintained an\naverage processing time of 2.78 seconds per website and an API cost of around\n$3.18 per 1,000 websites. Moreover, CLASP surpasses leading previous solutions,\nachieving over 40% higher recall and a 20% improvement in F1 score for phishing\ndetection on the collected dataset. To support further research, we have made\nour dataset publicly available, supporting the development of more advanced\nphishing detection systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "CLASP\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc9c0\ub2a5\ud615 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud53c\uc2f1 \uc6f9\uc0ac\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac10\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud53c\uc2f1 \uc6f9\uc0ac\uc774\ud2b8\ub294 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc704\ud611\uc73c\ub85c, \uc815\ud655\ud558\uace0 \ube44\uc6a9 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uac10\uc9c0 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc5ec\ub7ec \uac1c\uc758 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec URL \uad6c\uc870, \uc6f9\ud398\uc774\uc9c0 \uc2a4\ud06c\ub9b0\uc0f7 \ubc0f HTML \ucf58\ud150\uce20\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "Gemini 1.5 Flash \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc0c8\ub85c \ud3b8\uc9d1\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c F1 \uc810\uc218 83.01%\ub85c \uac00\uc7a5 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \ud3c9\uade0 \ucc98\ub9ac \uc2dc\uac04\uc740 2.78\ucd08, API \ube44\uc6a9\uc740 1,000\uac1c \uc6f9\uc0ac\uc774\ud2b8\ub2f9 \uc57d $3.18\uc774\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "CLASP\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\ubcf4\ub2e4 40% \uc774\uc0c1 \ub192\uc740 \uc7ac\ud604\uc728\uacfc 20% \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub41c F1 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \uae30\ub85d\ud558\uc600\uace0, \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uacf5\uac1c\ud558\uc5ec \ucd94\uac00 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud560 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud53c\uc2f1 \uc6f9\uc0ac\uc774\ud2b8\ub294 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc704\ud611\uc73c\ub85c, \uc815\ud655\ud558\uace0 \ube44\uc6a9 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc6f9 \ub9ac\uc18c\uc2a4\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uce21\uba74\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uad6c\ucd95\ub41c \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc9c0\ub2a5\ud615 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud53c\uc2f1 \uc6f9\uc0ac\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c CLASP\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 URL\uc774\ub098 QR \ucf54\ub4dc\ub97c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uace0, URL \uad6c\uc870, \uc6f9\ud398\uc774\uc9c0 \uc2a4\ud06c\ub9b0\uc0f7 \ubc0f HTML \ucf58\ud150\uce20\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc5ec \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \ud53c\uc2f1 \uc704\ud611\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \uc804\ubb38\ud654\ub41c LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc6b4\uc601 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc870\ud569 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc2e4\ud5d8\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uad81\uadf9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac01 \uc6f9\uc0ac\uc774\ud2b8 \ud3c9\uac00 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ub418\ub3c4\ub85d \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \uc870\ud569\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c LLM, \uc989 Gemini 1.5 Flash \ubc0f GPT-4o mini\ub97c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uc600\uace0, Gemini 1.5 Flash\uac00 \uc0c8\ub86d\uac8c \ud3b8\uc9d1\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c F1 \uc810\uc218 83.01%\ub85c \ucd5c\uace0\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uae30\ub85d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc6f9\uc0ac\uc774\ud2b8\ub2f9 \ud3c9\uade0 \ucc98\ub9ac \uc2dc\uac04 2.78\ucd08\uc640 1,000\uac1c \uc6f9\uc0ac\uc774\ud2b8\ub2f9 \uc57d $3.18\uc758 API \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ub354\uc6b1\uc774, CLASP\ub294 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\uc5ec \uc218\uc9d1\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \ud53c\uc2f1 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 40% \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \ub192\uc740 \uc7ac\ud604\uc728\uacfc 20% \uac1c\uc120\ub41c F1 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ucd94\uac00 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uacf5\uac1c\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf4\ub2e4 \ubc1c\uc804\ub41c \ud53c\uc2f1 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uc600\ub2e4."}}

While conceptual modeling languages like i* provide rich qualitative\nrepresentations of strategic dependencies, they lack mechanisms for\nquantitative analysis of dynamic trade-offs. Conversely, classical game theory\noffers mathematical rigor but strips away contextual richness. This technical\nreport bridges this gap by developing computational foundations that formalize\ntwo critical dimensions of coopetition: interdependence and complementarity. We\nground interdependence in i* structural dependency analysis, translating\ndepender-dependee-dependum relationships into quantitative interdependence\ncoefficients through a structured translation framework. We formalize\ncomplementarity following Brandenburger and Nalebuff's Added Value concept,\nmodeling synergistic value creation with validated parameterization. We\nintegrate structural dependencies with bargaining power in value appropriation\nand introduce a game-theoretic formulation where Nash Equilibrium incorporates\nstructural interdependence. Validation combines comprehensive experimental\ntesting across power and logarithmic value function specifications,\ndemonstrating functional form robustness, with empirical application to the\nSamsung-Sony S-LCD joint venture (2004-2011), where logarithmic specifications\nachieve superior empirical fit (validation score 45/60) while power functions\nprovide theoretical tractability. This technical report serves as the\nfoundational reference for a coordinated research program examining strategic\ncoopetition in requirements engineering and multi-agent systems, with

Our framework formalizes evaluation\nthrough four complementary metrics: Task Success Rate (TSR) for effectiveness,\nTool Use Efficiency (TUE) for reliability, Tool Call Redundancy Rate (TCRR) for\nwasted effort, and Goal-Shift Recovery Time (GSRT) for adaptation latency.\nAgentChangeBench comprises 2,835 task sequences and five user personas, each\ndesigned to trigger realistic shift points in ongoing workflows. Using this\nsetup, we evaluate several frontier models and uncover sharp contrasts obscured\nby traditional $\\text{pass}@k$ scores: for example, GPT-4o reaches $92.2\\%$\nrecovery on airline booking shifts while Gemini collapses to $48.6\\%$, and\nretail tasks show near perfect parameter validity yet redundancy rates above\n$80\\%$, revealing major inefficiencies. These findings demonstrate that high\nraw accuracy does not imply robustness under dynamic goals, and that explicit\nmeasurement of recovery time and redundancy is essential.

To tackle this\nchallenge, we first formulate a joint trajectory and power control optimization\nproblem, and then present an innovative hierarchical action management\nframework to solve it. According to the hierarchical formulation, at the macro\nlevel, the master AUV models the agent selection process as a Markov decision\nprocess and deploys the proximal policy optimization algorithm for strategic\ntask allocation. At the micro level, each selected agent's decentralized\ndecision-making is modeled as a partially observable Markov decision process,\nand a multi-agent proximal policy optimization algorithm is used to dynamically\nadjust its trajectory and transmission power based on its local observations.\nUnder the centralized training and decentralized execution paradigm, our target\ndetection framework enables adaptive covert cooperation while satisfying both\nenergy and mobility constraints. By comprehensively modeling the considered\nsystem, the involved signals and tasks, as well as energy consumption,\ntheoretical insights and practical solutions for the efficient and secure\noperation of multiple AUVs are provided, offering significant implications for\nthe execution of underwater covert communication tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc790\uc728 \uc218\uc911 \ucc28\ub7c9(AUV)\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \uc218\uc911 \ud611\ub825 \ubaa9\ud45c \ud0d0\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uba70, \ud611\ub825 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ube44\ubc00\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc790\uc728 \uc218\uc911 \ucc28\ub7c9\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \uc218\uc911 \ube44\ubc00 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc218\ud589\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c \ud544\uc694.", "method": "\uc5f0\ud569 \uada4\uc801 \ubc0f \uc804\ub825 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc218\ub9bd\ud558\uace0, \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9 \uad00\ub9ac \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \ud574\uacb0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub9c8\uc2a4\ud130 AUV\uac00 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc120\ud0dd \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uace0, \uac01 \uc120\ud0dd\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \ub3d9\uc791\ud558\uc5ec \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ube44\ubc00 \ud611\ub825\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec AUV\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \uc6b4\uc601\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uacfc \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc5ec \uc218\uc911 \ube44\ubc00 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \uc2e4\ud589\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc758\ubbf8\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc790\uc728 \uc218\uc911 \ucc28\ub7c9(AUV)\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \uc218\uc911 \ud611\ub825 \ubaa9\ud45c \ud0d0\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uba70, \ud611\ub825 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ube44\ubc00\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uade0\ud615\uc5d0 \uc911\uc810\uc744 \ub461\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uba3c\uc800 \uc5f0\ud569 \uada4\uc801 \ubc0f \uc804\ub825 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc815\uc2dd\ud654\ud55c \ud6c4, \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud601\uc2e0\uc801\uc778 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9 \uad00\ub9ac \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc815\uc2dd\ud654\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \uac70\uc2dc\uc801 \uc218\uc900\uc5d0\uc11c \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud130 AUV\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc120\ud0dd \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uace0 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud560\ub2f9\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uadfc\uc811 \uc815\ucc45 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ubc30\uce58\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubbf8\uc2dc\uc801 \uc218\uc900\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uac01 \uc120\ud0dd\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc774 \ubd80\ubd84\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad00\ucc30 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ub418\uba70, \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uadfc\uc811 \uc815\ucc45 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc9c0\uc5ed \uad00\ucc30\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uc5ec \uada4\uc801\uacfc \uc804\uc1a1 \uc804\ub825\uc744 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uc911\uc2dd \ud6c8\ub828\uacfc \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc2e4\ud589 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubaa9\ud45c \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0\uc640 \uc774\ub3d9\uc131 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ubaa8\ub450 \ub9cc\uc871\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba74\uc11c \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ube44\ubc00 \ud611\ub825\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uace0\ub824\ub41c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c, \uad00\ub828 \uc2e0\ud638 \ubc0f \uc791\uc5c5, \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc18c\ube44\ub97c \uc885\ud569\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368, \uc5ec\ub7ec AUV\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \uc6b4\uc601\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uacfc \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc5ec \uc218\uc911 \ube44\ubc00 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \uc2e4\ud589\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc758\ubbf8\ub97c \ubd80\uc5ec\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Simultaneously, confidential\ncomputing (CC) is becoming the de facto security paradigm, enforcing stronger\nisolation and protection for sensitive workloads. However, securing\nstate-of-the-art storage with traditional CC methods struggles to scale and\ncompromises performance or security. To address these issues, we introduce\nsNVMe-oF, a storage management system extending the NVMe-oF protocol and\nadhering to the CC threat model by providing confidentiality, integrity, and\nfreshness guarantees. sNVMe-oF offers an appropriate control path and novel\nconcepts such as counter-leasing. sNVMe-oF also optimizes data path performance\nby leveraging NVMe metadata, introducing a new disaggregated Hazel Merkle Tree\n(HMT), and avoiding redundant IPSec protections. We achieve this without\nmodifying the NVMe-oF protocol. To prevent excessive resource usage while\ndelivering line rate, sNVMe-oF also uses accelerators of CC-capable smart NICs.\nWe prototype sNVMe-oF on an NVIDIA BlueField-3 and demonstrate how it

This\npaper introduces a quantifiable framework to address this, defining AGI as\nmatching the cognitive versatility and proficiency of a well-educated adult. To\noperationalize this, we ground our methodology in Cattell-Horn-Carroll theory,\nthe most empirically validated model of human cognition. The framework dissects\ngeneral intelligence into ten core cognitive domains-including reasoning,\nmemory, and perception-and adapts established human psychometric batteries to\nevaluate AI systems. Application of this framework reveals a highly \"jagged\"\ncognitive profile in contemporary models. While proficient in\nknowledge-intensive domains, current AI systems have critical deficits in\nfoundational cognitive machinery, particularly long-term memory storage.

Existing methods typically\nassume that both intra-entity and inter-graph correspondences are faultless,\nwhich is often violated in real-world MMKGs due to the reliance on expert\nannotations. In this paper, we reveal and study a highly practical yet\nunder-explored problem in MMEA, termed Dual-level Noisy Correspondence (DNC).\nDNC refers to misalignments in both intra-entity (entity-attribute) and\ninter-graph (entity-entity and attribute-attribute) correspondences. To address\nthe DNC problem, we propose a robust MMEA framework termed RULE. RULE first\nestimates the reliability of both intra-entity and inter-graph correspondences\nvia a dedicated two-fold principle. Leveraging the estimated reliabilities,\nRULE mitigates the negative impact of intra-entity noise during attribute\nfusion and prevents overfitting to noisy inter-graph correspondences during\ninter-graph discrepancy elimination. Beyond the training-time designs, RULE\nfurther incorporates a correspondence reasoning module that uncovers the\nunderlying attribute-attribute connection across graphs, guaranteeing more\naccurate equivalent entity identification. Extensive experiments on five\nbenchmarks verify the effectiveness of our method against the DNC compared with\nseven state-of-the-art methods.The code is available at\n\\href{https://github.com/XLearning-SCU/RULE}{XLearning-SCU/RULE}", "AI": {"tldr": "\uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \uc5d4\ud2f0\ud2f0 \uc815\ub82c(MMEA)\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \uc9c0\uc2dd \uadf8\ub798\ud504(MMKG)\uc5d0\uc11c \ub3d9\ub4f1\ud55c \uc5d4\ud2f0\ud2f0\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud55c\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c MMKG\uc5d0\uc11c \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc8fc\uc11d\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc790\uc8fc \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \uace0\ub824\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud604\uc7ac \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \uc5d4\ud2f0\ud2f0 \uc815\ub82c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uc8fc \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "DNC \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 RULE\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c MMEA \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

In web agent attacks, success requires the continuous\ndiscovery and evolution of attack strategies. To this end, we propose Genesis,\na novel agentic framework composed of three modules: Attacker, Scorer, and\nStrategist. The Attacker generates adversarial injections by integrating the\ngenetic algorithm with a hybrid strategy representation. The Scorer evaluates\nthe target web agent's responses to provide feedback. The Strategist\ndynamically uncovers effective strategies from interaction logs and compiles\nthem into a continuously growing strategy library, which is then re-deployed to\nenhance the Attacker's effectiveness.

However,\ntask imbalance remains a major challenge in MTL. Although balancing the\nconvergence speeds of different tasks is an effective approach to address this\nissue, it is highly challenging to accurately characterize the training\ndynamics and convergence speeds of multiple tasks within the complex MTL\nsystem. To this end, we attempt to analyze the training dynamics in MTL by\nleveraging Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory and propose a new MTL method,\nNTKMTL. Specifically, we introduce an extended NTK matrix for MTL and adopt\nspectral analysis to balance the convergence speeds of multiple tasks, thereby\nmitigating task imbalance. Based on the approximation via shared\nrepresentation, we further propose NTKMTL-SR, achieving training efficiency\nwhile maintaining competitive performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat our methods achieve state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of\nbenchmarks, including both multi-task supervised learning and multi-task\nreinforcement learning.

We introduce Momentum-Adaptive\nGradient Dropout (MAGDrop), a novel regularization method that dynamically\nadjusts dropout rates on activations based on current gradients and accumulated\nmomentum, enhancing stability in non-convex optimization landscapes. To\ntheoretically justify MAGDrop's effectiveness, we derive a tightened PAC-Bayes\ngeneralization bound that accounts for its adaptive nature, achieving up to 20%\nsharper bounds compared to standard approaches by leveraging momentum-driven\nperturbation control. Empirically, the activation-based MAGDrop outperforms\nbaseline regularization techniques, including standard dropout and adaptive\ngradient regularization, by 1-2% in test accuracy on MNIST (99.52%) and\nCIFAR-10 (90.63%), with generalization gaps of 0.48% and 7.14%, respectively.\nOur work bridges theoretical insights and practical advancements, offering a\nrobust framework for enhancing DNN generalization suitable for high-stakes\napplications.", "AI": {"tldr": "MAGDrop\ub294 DNN\uc758 \uacfc\uc801\ud569 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "DNN\uc758 \ub192\uc740 \uc6a9\ub7c9\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uacfc\uc801\ud569 \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0.", "method": "\ud604\uc7ac \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8\uc640 \ucd95\uc801\ub41c \ubaa8\uba58\ud140\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uc5ec \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub4dc\ub86d\uc544\uc6c3 \ube44\uc728\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c MAGDrop\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9.", "result": "MAGDrop\uc740 \ud45c\uc900 \ub4dc\ub86d\uc544\uc6c3 \ubc0f \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uc815\uaddc\ud654\ubcf4\ub2e4 MNIST\uc640 CIFAR-10\uc5d0\uc11c \uac01\uac01 1-2% \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 DNN \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub525 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(DNN)\uc740 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uace0\uc6a9\ub7c9\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc885\uc885 \uacfc\uc801\ud569\uc5d0 \uc2dc\ub2ec\ub9bd\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8\uc640 \ucd95\uc801\ub41c \ubaa8\uba58\ud140\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud65c\uc131\ud654\uc758 \ub4dc\ub86d\uc544\uc6c3 \ube44\uc728\uc744 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \ube44\ubcfc\ub85d \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 \ubaa8\uba58\ud140 \uc801\uc751 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \ub4dc\ub86d\uc544\uc6c3(MAGDrop)\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Therefore, we propose ShortcutBreaker, a novel unified\nfeature-reconstruction framework for MUAD tasks, featuring two key innovations\nto address the issue of shortcuts. First, drawing on matrix rank inequality, we\ndesign a low-rank noisy bottleneck (LRNB) to project highdimensional features\ninto a low-rank latent space, and theoretically demonstrate its capacity to\nprevent trivial identity reproduction. Second, leveraging ViTs global modeling\ncapability instead of merely focusing on local features, we incorporate a\nglobal perturbation attention to prevent information shortcuts in the decoders.\nExtensive experiments are performed on four widely used anomaly detection\nbenchmarks, including three industrial datasets (MVTec-AD, ViSA, and Real-IAD)\nand one medical dataset (Universal Medical).

Yet existing approaches struggle\nto strike the right balance: methods that tightly enforce safety often cripple\ntask performance, while those that prioritize reward leave safety constraints\nfrequently violated, producing diffuse cost landscapes that flatten gradients\nand stall policy improvement. We introduce the Uncertain Safety Critic (USC), a\nnovel approach that integrates uncertainty-aware modulation and refinement into\ncritic training. By concentrating conservatism in uncertain and costly regions\nwhile preserving sharp gradients in safe areas, USC enables policies to achieve\neffective reward-safety trade-offs. Extensive experiments show that USC reduces\nsafety violations by approximately 40% while maintaining competitive or higher\nrewards, and reduces the error between predicted and true cost gradients by\napproximately 83%, breaking the prevailing trade-off between safety and\nperformance and paving the way for scalable safe RL.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ubc30\ud3ec\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc548\uc804\uc744 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud788 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub824\uace0 \ud558\uba74 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc800\ud558\ub418\ub294 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uc798 \uc774\ub8e8\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uace0, \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \uc6b0\uc120\uc2dc\ud558\uba74 \uc548\uc804 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \uc790\uc8fc \uc704\ubc18\ud558\uac8c \ub418\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ube44\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc548\uc804 \ube44\ud3c9\uac00(USC)\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "RL \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc774 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc30\ud3ec\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc810.", "method": "\ube44\ud655\uc2e4\ud55c \ube44\uc6a9 \uc601\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf4\uc218\uc131\uc744 \uc9d1\uc911\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \uc601\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c \ub0a0\uce74\ub85c\uc6b4 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ube44\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc778\uc2dd \uc870\uc815 \ubc0f \uc815\uc81c \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ube44\ud3c9\uac00 \ud6c8\ub828\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "USC\ub294 \uc548\uc804 \uc704\ubc18\uc744 \uc57d 40% \uc904\uc774\uba70, \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ub610\ub294 \uadf8 \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uace0, \uc608\uce21\ub41c \ube44\uc6a9 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30\uc640 \uc2e4\uc81c \ube44\uc6a9 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \uac04\uc758 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \uc57d 83% \uc904\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc548\uc804\uc131\uacfc \uc131\ub2a5 \uac04\uc758 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uae68\uace0 \uc720\uc5f0\ud55c \uc548\uc804 RL\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uae38\uc744 \uc5f4\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubc30\ud3ec\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud788 \uc2dc\ud589\ud560 \uacbd\uc6b0 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0 \ud574\uac00 \ub418\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \uc6b0\uc120\uc2dc\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc548\uc804 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \uc790\uc8fc \uc704\ubc18\ud558\uac8c \ud574 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30\ub97c \ud3c9\ud0c4\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uace0 \uc815\ucc45 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \uc800\ud574\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ube44\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc548\uc804 \ube44\ud3c9\uac00(USC)\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ube44\ud3c9\uac00 \ud6c8\ub828\uc5d0 \ube44\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc778\uc2dd \uc870\uc815\uacfc \uc815\uc81c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4.

The framework features:\n(1) a natural language-driven state machine architecture that guides LLMs to\nemulate finite state machines and behavior trees through prompts, and (2) a\nlightweight memory module preserving strategic variables (e.g., tactics,\npriority units) across decision cycles.

Hughes"], "title": "Partial VOROS: A Cost-aware Performance Metric for Binary Classifiers with Precision and Capacity Constraints", "comment": null, "summary": "The ROC curve is widely used to assess binary classification performance. Yet\nfor some applications such as alert systems for hospitalized patient\nmonitoring, conventional ROC analysis cannot capture crucial factors that\nimpact deployment, such as enforcing a minimum precision constraint to avoid\nfalse alarm fatigue or imposing an upper bound on the number of predicted\npositives to represent the capacity of hospital staff. The usual area under the\ncurve metric also does not reflect asymmetric costs for false positives and\nfalse negatives. In this paper we address all three of these issues. First, we\nshow how the subset of classifiers that meet given precision and capacity\nconstraints can be represented as a feasible region in ROC space. We establish\nthe geometry of this feasible region.

Conventional self-play frameworks\nexploit agent symmetry within zero-sum competitive settings, yet this approach\nproves inadequate for open-ended learning scenarios characterized by inherent\nasymmetry. Human pedagogical systems exemplify asymmetric instructional\nframeworks wherein educators systematically construct challenges calibrated to\nindividual learners' developmental trajectories. The principal challenge\nresides in operationalizing these asymmetric, adaptive pedagogical mechanisms\nwithin artificial systems capable of autonomously synthesizing appropriate\ncurricula without predetermined task hierarchies. Here we present Heterogeneous\nAdversarial Play (HAP), an adversarial Automatic Curriculum Learning framework\nthat formalizes teacher-student interactions as a minimax optimization wherein\ntask-generating instructor and problem-solving learner co-evolve through\nadversarial dynamics. In contrast to prevailing ACL methodologies that employ\nstatic curricula or unidirectional task selection mechanisms, HAP establishes a\nbidirectional feedback system wherein instructors continuously recalibrate task\ncomplexity in response to real-time learner performance metrics.

We\nevaluated three deep learning models: a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), a Tabular\nResNet, and a Feature Tokenizer Transformer, on structured datasets from\nfinance, healthcare, and socioeconomics. Our findings reveal critical\ntrade-offs: the MLP demonstrated strong sustainability and robustness, the\nTransformer excelled in explainability and fairness at a very high\nenvironmental cost, and the Tabular ResNet offered a balanced profile.

By\ncombining the Visual Guidance with tree search, Med-VRAgent improves the\nmedical visual reasoning capabilities of VLMs. We use the trajectories\ncollected by Med-VRAgent as feedback to further improve the performance by\nfine-tuning the VLMs with the proximal policy optimization (PPO) objective.\nExperiments on multiple medical VQA benchmarks demonstrate that our method\noutperforms existing approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc758\ub8cc \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0\uc11c VLM\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Med-VRAgent\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc758\ub8cc \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0\uc11c VLM\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4(\ud658\uac01, \uc560\ub9e4\ud55c \uc124\uba85, \uc77c\uad00\uc131 \uc5c6\ub294 \ub17c\ub9ac \ubc0f \ubd80\uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc704\uce58 \uc9c0\uc815)\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "Visual Guidance \ubc0f Self-Reward \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uacfc Monte Carlo Tree Search(MCTS)\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c Med-VRAgent \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "Med-VRAgent\ub294 \uc758\ub8cc VQA \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Med-VRAgent\ub294 VLM\uc758 \uc758\ub8cc \uc2dc\uac01 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ube44\uc8fc\uc5bc \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(VLM)\uc740 \uc758\ub8cc \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ud658\uac01, \ubaa8\ud638\ud55c \uc124\uba85, \uc77c\uad00\uc131 \uc5c6\ub294 \ub17c\ub9ac \ubc0f \ubd80\uc2e4\ud55c \uc704\uce58 \uc9c0\uc815\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc758\ub8cc \ube44\uc8fc\uc5bc \ucd94\ub860 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8(Med-VRAgent)\ub77c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \ube44\uc8fc\uc5bc \uac00\uc774\ub358\uc2a4 \ubc0f \uc790\uae30 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uacfc \ubaac\ud14c\uce74\ub97c\ub85c \ud2b8\ub9ac \ud0d0\uc0c9(MCTS)\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ube44\uc8fc\uc5bc \uac00\uc774\ub358\uc2a4\uc640 \ud2b8\ub9ac \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 Med-VRAgent\ub294 VLM\uc758 \uc758\ub8cc \ube44\uc8fc\uc5bc \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Med-VRAgent\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc218\uc9d1\ub41c \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uadfc\uc811 \uc815\ucc45 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654(PPO) \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 VLM\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub354\uc6b1 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc758\ub8cc VQA \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc \ub2ec\uc131\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

In\nmany real-world applications, such as energy management and stock investment,\nagents can access multi-step predictions of future states, which provide\nadditional advantages for decision making. However, multi-step predictions are\ninherently high-dimensional: naively embedding these predictions into an MDP\nleads to an exponential blow-up in state space and the curse of dimensionality.\nMoreover, existing RL theory provides few tools to analyze prediction-augmented\nMDPs, as it typically works on one-step transition kernels and cannot\naccommodate multi-step predictions with errors or partial action-coverage. We\naddress these challenges with three key innovations: First, we propose the\n\\emph{Bayesian value function} to characterize the optimal prediction-aware\npolicy tractably. Second, we develop a novel \\emph{Bellman-Jensen Gap} analysis\non the Bayesian value function, which enables characterizing the value of\nimperfect predictions. Third, we introduce BOLA (Bayesian Offline Learning with\nOnline Adaptation), a two-stage model-based RL algorithm that separates offline\nBayesian value learning from lightweight online adaptation to real-time\npredictions. We prove that BOLA remains sample-efficient even under imperfect\npredictions.

However, existing LLM-agent-based analytics\nframeworks operate under the assumption of centralized data access, offering\nlittle to no privacy protection. In contrast, federated analytics (FA) enables\nprivacy-preserving computation across distributed data sources, but lacks\nsupport for natural language input and requires structured, machine-readable\nqueries. In this work, we present LAFA, the first system that integrates\nLLM-agent-based data analytics with FA. LAFA introduces a hierarchical\nmulti-agent architecture that accepts natural language queries and transforms\nthem into optimized, executable FA workflows. A coarse-grained planner first\ndecomposes complex queries into sub-queries, while a fine-grained planner maps\neach subquery into a Directed Acyclic Graph of FA operations using prior\nstructural knowledge. To improve execution efficiency, an optimizer agent\nrewrites and merges multiple DAGs, eliminating redundant operations and\nminimizing computational and communicational overhead.

However, RLVR highly depends on\nwell-crafted task queries and corresponding ground-truth answers to provide\naccurate rewards, which requires massive human efforts and hinders the RL\nscaling processes, especially under agentic scenarios. Although a few recent\nworks explore task synthesis methods, the difficulty of generated agentic tasks\ncan hardly be controlled to provide effective RL training advantages. To\nachieve agentic RLVR with higher scalability, we explore self-play training for\ndeep search agents, in which the learning LLM utilizes multi-turn search engine\ncalling and acts simultaneously as both a task proposer and a problem solver.\nThe task proposer aims to generate deep search queries with well-defined\nground-truth answers and increasing task difficulty. The problem solver tries\nto handle the generated search queries and output the correct answer\npredictions. To ensure that each generated search query has accurate ground\ntruth, we collect all the searching results from the proposer's trajectory as\nexternal knowledge, then conduct retrieval-augmentation generation (RAG) to\ntest whether the proposed query can be correctly answered with all necessary\nsearch documents provided. In this search self-play (SSP) game, the proposer\nand the solver co-evolve their agent capabilities through both competition and\ncooperation. With substantial experimental results, we find that SSP can\nsignificantly improve search agents' performance uniformly on various\nbenchmarks without any supervision under both from-scratch and continuous RL\ntraining setups.

StarBench standardizes evaluation across eight combat tasks and two\nregimes with shared tasks and metrics: (i) direct control, where agents receive\nonly screenshots and must emit low-level primitives (click and keypress) with\nno semantic hints; and (ii) tool-assisted control, where higher-level intents\ncan be mapped to primitives by detectors and OCR outputs provide optional\ntextualized observations to ease UI grounding. To mirror human practice,\nStarBench also includes an ask-or-act diagnostic that measures whether and when\nagents choose to request brief guidance before proceeding, and how that choice\naffects subsequent performance. We report reference baselines for contemporary\nVLMs and a human reference. Results expose sizable gaps in\nperception-to-control fidelity in the direct regime, while showing that\njudicious information seeking correlates with improved success, establishing\nStarBench as a reproducible yardstick for agentic information seeking and\nmultimodal decision-making in real-client play.", "AI": {"tldr": "StarBench\ub294 \uc778\uac04\uacfc \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \ubc0f \uc815\ubcf4 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c RPG \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ube44\uc804-\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(VLMs)\uc774 \uc778\uac04 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\uc5b4\ucc98\ub7fc \ud589\ub3d9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0 \uc5ec\ubd80\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud568.", "method": "StarBench\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub808\uc9d0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5ec\ub35f \uac00\uc9c0 \uc804\ud22c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud45c\uc900\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4: \uc9c1\uc811 \uc81c\uc5b4\uc640 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc9c0\uc6d0 \uc81c\uc5b4.", "result": "\ud604\uc7ac VLM\ub4e4\uacfc \uc778\uac04 \ucc38\uc870\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uc9c1\uc811 \uc81c\uc5b4\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc778\uc2dd-\uc81c\uc5b4 \ucda9\uc2e4\ub3c4\uc5d0 \ud070 \uaca9\ucc28\uac00 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "StarBench\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc815\ubcf4 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ubc0f \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc7ac\ud604 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uae30\uc900\uc774 \ub41c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc778\uac04 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\uc5b4\ub294 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud788 \ubc84\ud2bc\uc744 \ub204\ub974\ub294 \uac83 \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uc77c\uc744 \ud55c\ub2e4: \uadf8\ub4e4\uc740 \ud654\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc815\ubc00\ud55c \ud0a4\ubcf4\ub4dc-\ub9c8\uc6b0\uc2a4 \ud589\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\ud658\ud558\uace0, \ub9c9\ud790 \uacbd\uc6b0 \ub2e4\uc2dc \uc2dc\ub3c4\ud558\uae30 \uc804\uc5d0 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud604\uc7ac \ube44\uc804-\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(VLMs)\uc774 \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc9c8\ubb38\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub2e8\uc21c\ud654\ub41c \uc81c\uc5b4 \ub610\ub294 \ub3c4\uad6c \uae30\ubc18 scaffolds \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uaca9\ub824\ub418\ub294 \uacb0\uacfc\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \uc6d0\uc2dc \uc2a4\ud06c\ub9b0\uc0f7\uc744 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uc800\uc218\uc900 \ud589\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ub9e4\ud551\ud558\uace0, \uc5b8\uc81c \uc9c0\uce68\uc744 \uc694\uccad\ud560\uc9c0\ub97c \uacb0\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc778\uac04\uacfc \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \ud50c\ub808\uc774\ub294 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ud574\uacb0\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc774\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc778\uac04\uacfc \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc5ed\ub7c9, \uc989 \ud53d\uc140\uc5d0\uc11c \ud589\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uacfc \ud589\ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 StarBench\ub77c\ub294 \ud134\uc81c RPG \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.

GUI agents offer a powerful, API-independent\nalternative, but their adoption is hindered by the perception of poor\nperformance, as even the best models (e.g. Qwen3-VL-235B) scores are capped at\naround 60% on benchmarks like AndroidControl, far from viability for real-world\nuse. Our research reveals that issue lies not only with the models but with the\nbenchmarks themselves. We identified notable shortcomings in AndroidControl,\nincluding ambiguities and factual errors, which systematically underrates agent\ncapabilities. To address this critical oversight, we enhanced AndroidControl\ninto AndroidControl-Curated, a refined version of the benchmark improved\nthrough a rigorous purification pipeline. On this enhanced benchmark,\nstate-of-the-art models achieve success rates nearing 75% on complex tasks (15%\nimprovement), reflecting that on-device GUI agents are actually closer to\npractical deployment than previously thought. We introduce our new SOTA model,\nMagma-R1- 3B, post-trained on just 2.4k curated samples using 60 hours of an\nH20 GPU (approximately $60).

The paper is under review", "summary": "In this paper, we present SOCIA-Nabla, an end-to-end, agentic framework that\ntreats simulator construction asinstance optimization over code within a\ntextual computation graph. Specialized LLM-driven agents are embedded as graph\nnodes, and a workflow manager executes a loss-driven loop: code synthesis ->\nexecution -> evaluation -> code repair. The optimizer performs Textual-Gradient\nDescent (TGD), while human-in-the-loop interaction is reserved for task-spec\nconfirmation, minimizing expert effort and keeping the code itself as the\ntrainable object. Across three CPS tasks, i.e., User Modeling, Mask Adoption,\nand Personal Mobility, SOCIA-Nabla attains state-of-the-art overall accuracy.\nBy unifying multi-agent orchestration with a loss-aligned optimization view,\nSOCIA-Nabla converts brittle prompt pipelines into reproducible,\nconstraint-aware simulator code generation that scales across domains and\nsimulation granularities.

Non-archival workshop", "summary": "Automating quantitative trading strategy development in dynamic markets is\nchallenging, especially with increasing demand for personalized investment\nsolutions. Existing methods often fail to explore the vast strategy space while\npreserving the diversity essential for robust performance across changing\nmarket conditions. We present QuantEvolve, an evolutionary framework that\ncombines quality-diversity optimization with hypothesis-driven strategy\ngeneration. QuantEvolve employs a feature map aligned with investor\npreferences, such as strategy type, risk profile, turnover, and return\ncharacteristics, to maintain a diverse set of effective strategies. It also\nintegrates a hypothesis-driven multi-agent system to systematically explore the\nstrategy space through iterative generation and evaluation.

While\nrecent dialogue-based interactive retrieval systems can clarify user intent,\nthey are inefficient as they often lack an explicit strategy to ask the most\ninformative questions. To address this limitation, we propose SherlockLLM, a\ndialogue-driven retrieval framework that learns an optimal questioning strategy\nvia Reinforcement Learning (RL) and avoids the need for large-scale annotated\ndialogue data. In our framework, an agent is trained to generate a sequence of\nbinary questions to efficiently narrow down the search space. To validate our\napproach, we introduce a benchmark with both structured and unstructured tasks.\nExperimental results show that SherlockLLM is a robust and efficient solution.\nOn the structured tasks, its performance matches strong baselines and\napproaches the theoretical optimal defined by binary search.
