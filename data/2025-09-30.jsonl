We consider a city network where human drivers travel\nthrough their chosen routes to reach their destinations in minimum travel time.\nThen, we convert one-third of the population into AVs, which are RL agents\nemploying Deep Q-learning algorithm. We define a set of optimization targets,\nor as we call them behaviors, namely selfish, collaborative, competitive,\nsocial, altruistic, and malicious. We impose a selected behavior on AVs through\ntheir rewards. We run our simulations using our in-house developed RL framework\nPARCOUR. Our simulations reveal that AVs optimize their travel times by up to\n5\\%, with varying impacts on human drivers' travel times depending on the AV\nbehavior. In all cases where AVs adopt a self-serving behavior, they achieve\nshorter travel times than human drivers. Our findings highlight the complexity\ndifferences in learning tasks of each target behavior. We demonstrate that the\nmulti-agent RL setting is applicable for collective routing on traffic\nnetworks, though their impact on coexisting parties greatly varies with the\nbehaviors adopted."}

Because learning in games assumes that multiple agents\nindependently learn their strategies, a discrepancy in optimization often\nemerges among the agents. To overcome this discrepancy, the prediction of the\nfuture reward is incorporated into algorithms, typically known as Optimistic\nFollow-the-Regularized-Leader (OFTRL). However, the time delay in observing the\npast rewards hinders the prediction. Indeed, this study firstly proves that\neven a single-step delay worsens the performance of OFTRL from the aspects of\nregret and convergence. This study proposes the weighted OFTRL (WOFTRL), where\nthe prediction vector of the next reward in OFTRL is weighted $n$ times. We\nfurther capture an intuition that the optimistic weight cancels out this time\ndelay. We prove that when the optimistic weight exceeds the time delay, our\nWOFTRL recovers the good performances that the regret is constant\n($O(1)$-regret) in general-sum normal-form games, and the strategies converge\nto the Nash equilibrium as a subsequence (best-iterate convergence) in\npoly-matrix zero-sum games. The theoretical results are supported and\nstrengthened by our experiments."}

We present GeoSketch, a\nneural-symbolic framework that recasts geometric reasoning as an interactive\nperception-reasoning-action loop. GeoSketch integrates: (1) a Perception module\nthat abstracts diagrams into structured logic forms, (2) a Symbolic Reasoning\nmodule that applies geometric theorems to decide the next deductive step, and\n(3) a Sketch Action module that executes operations such as drawing auxiliary\nlines or applying transformations, thereby updating the diagram in a closed\nloop.

To understand and analyze the agentic reasoning\npatterns, we propose the concept of agentic reasoning graph: cluster the\nenvironment's document embeddings into nodes, and map each tool call to its\nnearest node to build a reasoning path. Surprisingly, we identify that the\nability to revisit a previously visited node, widely taken as a crucial pattern\nin static reasoning, is often missing for agentic reasoning for many models.\nBased on the insight, we propose a tool-augmented test-time scaling method to\nimprove LLM's agentic reasoning performance by adding tools to encourage models\nto revisit. We expect our benchmark and the agentic reasoning framework to aid\nfuture studies of understanding and pushing the boundaries of agentic\nreasoning."}
