Our framework includes two key components: (1) a game theory-based taxonomy of uncooperative agent behaviors, addressing a notable gap in the existing literature; and (2) a structured, multi-stage simulation pipeline that dynamically generates and refines uncooperative behaviors as agents' states evolve. We evaluate the framework via a collaborative resource management setting, measuring system stability using metrics such as survival time and resource overuse rate. Empirically, our framework achieves 96.7% accuracy in generating realistic uncooperative behaviors, validated by human evaluations. Our results reveal a striking contrast: cooperative agents maintain perfect system stability (100% survival over 12 rounds with 0% resource overuse), while any uncooperative behavior can trigger rapid system collapse within 1 to 7 rounds. These findings demonstrate that uncooperative agents can significantly degrade collective outcomes, highlighting the need for designing more resilient multi-agent systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ube44\ud611\ub825\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9\uc774 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ubd88\uc548\uc815\ud654\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ubd95\uad34\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud558\uace0 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ube44\ud611\ub825\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9\uc774 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\ub824\ub294 \ud544\uc694\uc131.", "method": "\uac8c\uc784 \uc774\ub860 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ube44\ud611\ub825\uc801 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud589\ub3d9 \ubd84\ub958\ubc95\uacfc \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0\uc11c \ube44\ud611\ub825\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 96.7%\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub85c \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \ube44\ud611\ub825\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud588\uc73c\uba70, \ube44\ud611\ub825\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9\uc774 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ube60\ub978 \ubd95\uad34\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ube44\ud611\ub825\uc801 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc9d1\ud569\uc801 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ud06c\uac8c \uc800\ud574\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ub354 \ud0c4\ub825\uc801\uc778 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc124\uacc4\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ube44\ud611\ub825\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9\uc774 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ubd88\uc548\uc815\ud654\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ubd95\uad34\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud558\uace0 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud575\uc2ec \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4: (1) \uae30\uc874 \ubb38\ud5cc\uc758 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uacf5\ubc31\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8e8\ub294 \ube44\ud611\ub825\uc801 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac8c\uc784 \uc774\ub860 \uae30\ubc18 \ubd84\ub958\ubc95\uacfc (2) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc0c1\ud0dc \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ube44\ud611\ub825\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud611\ub825\uc801 \uc790\uc6d0 \uad00\ub9ac \uc124\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0, \uc0dd\uc874 \uc2dc\uac04 \ubc0f \uc790\uc6d0 \uacfc\uc789 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub960\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \uce21\uc815\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc778\uac04 \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uac80\uc99d\ub41c \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \ube44\ud611\ub825\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub370 96.7%\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ub180\ub77c\uc6b4 \ub300\uc870\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4: \ud611\ub825\uc801 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc644\ubcbd\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc548\uc815\uc131(12 \ub77c\uc6b4\ub4dc\uc5d0\uc11c 100% \uc0dd\uc874, 0% \uc790\uc6d0 \uacfc\uc789 \uc0ac\uc6a9)\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ubc18\uba74, \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ube44\ud611\ub825\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9\uc740 1\uc5d0\uc11c 7 \ub77c\uc6b4\ub4dc \uc774\ub0b4\uc5d0 \ube60\ub978 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ubd95\uad34\ub97c \uc720\ubc1c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc1c\uacac\uc740 \ube44\ud611\ub825\uc801 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc9d1\ud569\uc801 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \uc800\ud574\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uace0, \ub354 \ud0c4\ub825\uc801\uc778 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc124\uacc4\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Recent instruction-first systems translate grids into concise natural-language or DSL rules executed in generate-execute-select loops, yet we lack a principled account of how encodings shape model perception and how to separate instruction errors from execution errors. We hypothesize that modality imposes perceptual bottlenecks -- text flattens 2D structure into 1D tokens while images preserve layout but can introduce patch-size aliasing -- thereby shaping which grid features are reliably perceived. To test this, we isolate perception from reasoning across nine text and image modalities using a weighted set-disagreement metric and a two-stage reasoning pipeline, finding that structured text yields precise coordinates on sparse features, images capture 2D shapes yet are resolution-sensitive, and combining them improves execution (about 8 perception points; about 0.20 median similarity). Overall, aligning representations with transformer inductive biases and enabling cross-validation between text and image yields more accurate instructions and more reliable execution without changing

Moreover, their performance typically declines when addressing complex problems that require multi-step reasoning and analysis. In response to these challenges, we propose leveraging both LLMs and AI agents to develop education assistants aimed at enhancing undergraduate learning in biomechanics courses that focus on analyzing the force and moment in the musculoskeletal system of the human body. To achieve our goal, we construct a dual-module framework to enhance LLM performance in biomechanics educational tasks: 1) we apply Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to improve the specificity and logical consistency of LLM's responses to the conceptual true/false questions; 2) we build a Multi-Agent System (MAS) to solve calculation-oriented problems involving multi-step reasoning and code execution. Specifically, we evaluate the performance of several LLMs, i.e., Qwen-1.0-32B, Qwen-2.5-32B, and Llama-70B, on a biomechanics dataset comprising 100 true/false conceptual questions and problems requiring equation derivation and calculation. Our results demonstrate that RAG significantly enhances the performance and stability of LLMs in answering conceptual questions, surpassing those of vanilla models. On the other hand, the MAS constructed using multiple LLMs demonstrates its ability to perform multi-step reasoning, derive equations, execute code, and generate explainable solutions for tasks that require calculation. These findings demonstrate the potential of applying RAG and MAS to enhance LLM performance for specialized courses in engineering curricula, providing a promising direction for developing intelligent tutoring in engineering education.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc774 \uc77c\ubc18 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc7ac\ub2e4\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc654\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud2b9\uc815 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc751\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc774 \uac10\uc18c\ud558\uace0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\ub294\ub2e4. \uc774\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \uc0dd\uccb4\uc5ed\ud559 \uacfc\ubaa9\uc758 \ud559\ubd80 \uad50\uc721 \uac15\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uad50\uc721 \ubcf4\uc870 \ub3c4\uad6c \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud574 RAG\uc640 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(MAS)\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec LLM\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc774\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4c8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\ud654 \uc751\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc \uc800\ud558\uc640 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0\uc758 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub300\uc751 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "RAG\ub97c \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec LLM\uc758 \uac1c\ub150\uc801 \uc9c4\uc704 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc751\ub2f5\uc758 \uad6c\uccb4\uc131\uacfc \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0, \ub2e4\uc911 LLM\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc0ac\uace0\uc640 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc2e4\ud589\uc744 \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc9c0\ud5a5 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "RAG\uac00 LLM\uc758 \uac1c\ub150 \uc9c8\ubb38 \ub2f5\ubcc0 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba70, \ub2e4\uc911 LLM\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c MAS\ub294 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc0ac\uace0, \ubc29\uc815\uc2dd \uc720\ub3c4, \ucf54\ub4dc \uc2e4\ud589 \ubc0f \uc124\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "RAG\uc640 MAS\ub97c \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uacf5\ud559 \uad50\uc721 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uc704\ud55c LLM \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \uacf5\ud559 \uad50\uc721\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c0\ub2a5\ud615 \ud29c\ud130\ub9c1 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc740 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub208\uc5d0 \ub744\ub294 \ub2e4\uc7ac\ub2e4\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud2b9\uc815 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc751\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uace0\uc720\ud55c \uc9c0\uc2dd \uaca9\ucc28\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc774 \uc885\uc885 \uac10\uc18c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc0ac\uace0 \ubc0f \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \ub54c \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc800\ud558\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\uc751\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 LLM\uacfc AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc778\uccb4\uc758 \uadfc\uace8\uaca9\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \ud798\uacfc \ubaa8\uba58\ud2b8\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\ub294 \uc0dd\uccb4\uc5ed\ud559 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uad50\uc721 \ubcf4\uc870 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc0dd\uccb4\uc5ed\ud559 \uad50\uc721 \uacfc\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c LLM \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc774\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4c8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: 1) \uac1c\ub150\uc801 \uc9c4\uc704 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c LLM \uc751\ub2f5\uc758 \uad6c\uccb4\uc131\uacfc \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\ub97c \uc801\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4;

We propose a large language model (LLM)-based reward design approach to generate autonomous cyber defense policies in a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-driven experimental simulation environment. Multiple attack and defense agent personas were crafted, reflecting heterogeneity in agent actions, to generate LLM-guided reward designs where the LLM was first provided with contextual cyber simulation environment information. These reward structures were then utilized within a DRL-driven attack-defense simulation environment to learn an ensemble of cyber defense policies. Our results suggest that LLM-guided reward designs can lead to effective defense strategies against diverse adversarial behaviors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud558\uace0 \ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uc728 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \uacf5\uaca9 \ubc0f \ubc29\uc5b4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc790\uc728 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uc815\ucc45 \uc218\ub9bd\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uad6c\uc870 \uc124\uacc4\ub294 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc5d0\uac8c \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc778 \uacfc\uc81c\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc124\uacc4 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uc728 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc5ec\ub7ec \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uacf5\uaca9 \ubc0f \ubc29\uc5b4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud398\ub974\uc18c\ub098\ub97c \ub9cc\ub4e4\uc5b4 LLM\uc774 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uc124\uacc4\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc124\uacc4\uac00 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uc804\ub7b5\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc9c8 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubcf5\uc7a1\ud558\uace0 \ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uc728 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \uacf5\uaca9 \ubc0f \ubc29\uc5b4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc804\ubb38\uc801\uc778 \uacfc\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc2ec\uce35 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(DRL) \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uc728 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc124\uacc4 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5ec\ub7ec \uacf5\uaca9 \ubc0f \ubc29\uc5b4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud398\ub974\uc18c\ub098\ub97c \uc81c\uc791\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud589\ub3d9\uc758 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131\uc744 \ubc18\uc601\ud558\uace0, LLM\uc5d0\uac8c\ub294 \ucc98\uc74c\uc5d0 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc801 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ud658\uacbd \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc5ec LLM \uc548\ub0b4 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uad6c\uc870\ub294 DRL \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uacf5\uaca9-\ubc29\uc5b4 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ud658\uacbd \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ud65c\uc6a9\ub418\uc5b4 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uc815\ucc45\uc758 \uc559\uc0c1\ube14\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 LLM \uc548\ub0b4 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc124\uacc4\uac00 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uc804\ub7b5\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc9c8 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Accepted as a poster presentation in the Machine Learning for the Physical Sciences workshop at NeurIPS 2025", "summary": "Operational forecasting of the ionosphere remains a critical space weather challenge due to sparse observations, complex coupling across geospatial layers, and a growing need for timely, accurate predictions that support Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), communications, aviation safety, as well as satellite operations. As part of the 2025 NASA Heliolab, we present a curated, open-access dataset that integrates diverse ionospheric and heliospheric measurements into a coherent, machine learning-ready structure, designed specifically to support next-generation forecasting models and address gaps in current operational frameworks. Our workflow integrates a large selection of data sources comprising Solar Dynamic Observatory data, solar irradiance indices (F10.7), solar wind parameters (velocity and interplanetary magnetic field), geomagnetic activity indices (Kp, AE, SYM-H), and NASA JPL's Global Ionospheric Maps of Total Electron Content (GIM-TEC). We also implement geospatially sparse data such as the TEC derived from the World-Wide GNSS Receiver Network and crowdsourced Android smartphone measurements. This novel heterogeneous dataset is temporally and spatially aligned into a single, modular data structure that supports both physical and data-driven modeling. Leveraging this dataset, we train and benchmark several spatiotemporal machine learning architectures for forecasting vertical TEC under both quiet and geomagnetically active conditions. This work presents an extensive dataset and modeling pipeline that enables exploration of not only ionospheric dynamics but also broader Sun-Earth interactions, supporting both scientific inquiry and operational forecasting efforts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc774\uc628\uce35\uc758 \uc6b4\uc601 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c

This evolution introduces a fundamental challenge: verifying both the authenticity of an autonomous agent and the true intent behind its transactions in a decentralized, trustless environment. Traditional payment systems assume human authorization, but autonomous, agent-led payments remove that safeguard. This paper presents a blockchain-based framework that cryptographically authenticates and verifies the intent of every AI-initiated transaction. The proposed system leverages decentralized identity (DID) standards and verifiable credentials to establish agent identities, on-chain intent proofs to record user authorization, and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to preserve privacy while ensuring policy compliance. Additionally, secure execution environments (TEE-based attestations) guarantee the integrity of agent reasoning and execution. The hybrid on-chain/off-chain architecture provides an immutable audit trail linking user intent to payment outcome. Through qualitative analysis, the framework demonstrates strong resistance to impersonation, unauthorized transactions, and misalignment of intent. This work lays the foundation for secure, auditable, and intent-aware autonomous economic agents, enabling a future of verifiable trust and accountability in AI-driven financial ecosystems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c AI \uae30\ubc18 \uacb0\uc81c\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uacfc \uc758\ub3c4\ub97c \uac80\uc99d\ud558\ub294 \ube14\ub85d\uccb4\uc778 \uae30\ubc18 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\ub97c \ub300\uc2e0\ud574 \uc7ac\ubb34 \uac70\ub798\ub97c \uc2dc\uc791\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uba74\uc11c, \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc9c4\uc815\uc131\uacfc \uac70\ub798\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc758\ub3c4\ub97c \uac80\uc99d\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ubd84\uc0b0\ud615 \uc2e0\uc6d0(DID) \ud45c\uc900\uacfc \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc790\uaca9 \uc99d\uba85\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc2e0\uc6d0, \uc628\uccb4\uc778 \uc758\ub3c4 \uc99d\uba85\uc744 \uae30\ub85d\ud558\uace0, \uc81c\ub85c \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc99d\uba85(ZKP)\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \ubc0f \uc815\ucc45 \uc900\uc218\ub97c \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc0ac\ub78c \ud589\uc138, \ubb34\ub2e8 \uac70\ub798, \uc758\ub3c4 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub97c \uac15\ud558\uac8c \uc800\ud56d\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 AI \uae30\ubc18 \uae08\uc735 \uc0dd\ud0dc\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc640 \ucc45\uc784\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uc548\uc804\ud558\uace0 \uac10\uc0ac \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc790\uc728 \uacbd\uc81c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \ub9c8\ub828\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5(AI) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ub610\ub294 \ub2e4\ub978 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ub300\uc2e0\ud558\uc5ec \uc7ac\ubb34 \uac70\ub798\ub97c \uc2dc\uc791\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub192\uc544\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc9c4\uc815\uc131\uacfc \uac70\ub798 \ub4a4\uc5d0 \uc228\uaca8\uc9c4 \uc9c4\uc815\ud55c \uc758\ub3c4\ub97c \uac80\uc99d\ud558\ub294 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uc804\uc744 \uc81c\uae30\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc9c0\ubd88 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc2b9\uc778\uc744 \uc804\uc81c\ub85c \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc790\uc728\uc801 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc8fc\ub3c4\uc758 \uc9c0\ubd88\uc740 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc548\uc804 \uc7a5\uce58\ub97c \uc81c\uac70\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 AI\uac00 \uc2dc\uc791\ud55c \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uac70\ub798\uc758 \uc758\ub3c4\ub97c \uc554\ud638\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \uc778\uc99d\ud558\uace0 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\ub294 \ube14\ub85d\uccb4\uc778 \uae30\ubc18 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ubd84\uc0b0\ud615 \uc2e0\uc6d0(DID) \ud45c\uc900\uacfc \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc790\uaca9 \uc99d\uba85\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc2e0\uc6d0\uc744 \uc124\uc815\ud558\uace0, \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc2b9\uc778\uc744 \uae30\ub85d\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc628\uccb4\uc778 \uc758\ub3c4 \uc99d\uba85\uc758 \uad6c\ud604, \uc815\ucc45 \uc900\uc218\ub97c \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\ub294 \uc81c\ub85c \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc99d\uba85(ZKP)\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c\ub2e4. \ucd94\uac00\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \uc548\uc804\ud55c \uc2e4\ud589 \ud658\uacbd(TEE \uae30\ubc18 \uc99d\uba85)\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \uc2e4\ud589\uc758 \ubb34\uacb0\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc628\uccb4\uc778/\uc624\ud504\uccb4\uc778 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc758\ub3c4\uc640 \uc9c0\ubd88 \uacb0\uacfc \uac04\uc758 \ubd88\ubcc0 \uac10\uc0ac \ucd94\uc801\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc815\uc131\uc801 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc0ac\ub78c \ud589\uc138, \ubb34\ub2e8 \uac70\ub798 \ubc0f \uc758\ub3c4 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\uc5d0 \uac15\ud55c \uc800\ud56d\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 AI \uc8fc\ub3c4\uc758 \uae08\uc735 \uc0dd\ud0dc\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc640 \ucc45\uc784\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uc548\uc804\ud558\uace0 \uac10\uc0ac\ub97c \ubc1b\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc758\ub3c4 \uc778\uc9c0 \uc790\uc728 \uacbd\uc81c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \ub9c8\ub828\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

These inefficiencies underscore the need for persistent reasoning mechanisms that can recall and reuse prior computational traces.\n  We introduce Graph-Memoized Reasoning, a formal framework for representing, storing, and reusing reasoning workflows as graph-structured memory. By encoding past decision graphs and retrieving them through structural and semantic similarity, our approach enables compositional reuse of subgraphs across new reasoning tasks.\n  We formulate an optimization objective that minimizes total reasoning cost regularized by inconsistency between stored and generated workflows, providing a theoretical foundation for efficiency-consistency trade-offs in intelligent systems. We outline a conceptual evaluation protocol aligned with the proposed optimization objective.\n  This framework establishes the groundwork for interpretable, cost-efficient, and self-improving

Some of these perturbations even survive physical capture, posing security risks to high-stakes applications such as document processing, license plate recognition, and automated compliance systems. Existing defenses, such as adversarial training, input preprocessing, or post-recognition correction, are often model-specific, computationally expensive, and affect performance on unperturbed inputs while remaining vulnerable to unseen or adaptive attacks. To address these challenges, TopoReformer is introduced, a model-agnostic reformation pipeline that mitigates adversarial perturbations while preserving the structural integrity of text images. Topology studies properties of shapes and spaces that remain unchanged under continuous deformations, focusing on global structures such as connectivity, holes, and loops rather than exact distance. Leveraging these topological features, TopoReformer employs a topological autoencoder to enforce manifold-level consistency in latent space and improve robustness without explicit gradient regularization. The proposed method is benchmarked on EMNIST, MNIST, against standard adversarial attacks (FGSM, PGD, Carlini-Wagner), adaptive attacks (EOT, BDPA), and an OCR-specific watermark attack (FAWA).", "AI": {"tldr": "TopoReformer\ub294 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uc758 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc644\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc874\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ubcc0\ud615\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378 \ubd88\ubcc0\ud615 \uc7ac\ud615\uc131 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uace0\uae09 OCR \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uc778\uac04\uc5d0\uac8c \ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \ubcc0\ud654\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \ubb38\uc790 \uc804\uc0ac\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ubcc0\ud615 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uac00 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "TopoReformer\ub294 \ud1a0\ud3f4\ub85c\uc9c0\uc758 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc7a0\uc7ac \uacf5\uac04\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\uccb4 \uc218\uc900 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud558\uace0, \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc778 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 \uac15\uc778\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ud1a0\ud3f4\ub85c\uc9c0\uc801 \uc624\ud1a0\uc778\ucf54\ub354\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 EMNIST\uc640 MNIST \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \ud45c\uc900 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9(FGSM, PGD, Carlini-Wagner), \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uacf5\uaca9(EOT, BDPA), OCR \ud2b9\ud654 \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud06c \uacf5\uaca9(FAWA)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "TopoReformer\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud2b9\uc815\uc131\uc774 \uc5c6\uc73c\uba70, \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\uc5b4 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc774 \uac00\uc9c4 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uac15\ub825\ud558\uace0 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub41c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc801\ub300\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud615\ub41c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc815\uad50\ud55c OCR \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uc778\uac04\uc5d0\uac8c\ub294 \ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \ubcc0\ud654\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc798\ubabb\ub418\uac70\ub098 \uc624\ud574\uc758 \uc18c\uc9c0\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \uc804\uc0ac\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubcc0\ud615 \uc911 \uc77c\ubd80\ub294 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \ucea1\ucc98\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc0dd\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \ubb38\uc11c \ucc98\ub9ac, \ubc88\ud638\ud310 \uc778\uc2dd \ubc0f \uc790\ub3d9 \uaddc\uc815 \uc900\uc218 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uace0\uc704\ud5d8 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud6c8\ub828, \uc785\ub825 \uc804\ucc98\ub9ac \ub610\ub294 \uc778\uc2dd \ud6c4 \uc218\uc815\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\uc5b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud2b9\uc815\uc801\uc774\uba70, \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4e4\uace0 \ubcc0\ud615\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uc785\ub825\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\uba70 \ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\uac70\ub098 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 TopoReformer\uac00 \ub3c4\uc785\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubaa8\ub378 \ubd88\ubcc0\ud615 \uc7ac\ud615\uc131 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc740 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uc758 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc644\uc804\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ubcc0\ud615\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud1a0\ud3f4\ub85c\uc9c0\ub294 \uc5f0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ubcc0\ud615\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcc0\uacbd\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \ud615\ud0dc\uc640 \uacf5\uac04\uc758 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uba70, \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uac70\ub9ac\ubcf4\ub2e4\ub294 \uc5f0\uacb0\uc131, \uad6c\uba4d \ubc0f \ub8e8\ud504\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc804\uc5ed \uad6c\uc870\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucda5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud1a0\ud3f4\ub85c\uc9c0\uc801 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec TopoReformer\ub294 \uc7a0\uc7ac \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc591\uccb4 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uace0 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc778 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \uc5c6\uc774 \uac15\uc778\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud1a0\ud3f4\ub85c\uc9c0\uc801 \uc624\ud1a0\uc778\ucf54\ub354\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 EMNIST, MNIST\uc5d0\uc11c \ud45c\uc900 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9(FGSM, PGD, Carlini-Wagner), \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uacf5\uaca9(EOT, BDPA) \ubc0f OCR \ud2b9\ud654 \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud06c \uacf5\uaca9(FAWA)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Understanding why agents make decisions and how they achieve collective behavior is crucial. Existing explainable AI methods struggle in multi agent settings. They fail to attribute collective outcomes to individuals, quantify emergent behaviors, or capture complex interactions. We present MACIE Multi Agent Causal Intelligence Explainer, a framework combining structural causal models, interventional counterfactuals, and Shapley values to provide comprehensive explanations. MACIE addresses three questions. First, each agent's causal contribution using interventional attribution scores. Second, system level emergent intelligence through synergy metrics separating collective effects from individual contributions. Third, actionable explanations using natural language narratives synthesizing causal insights. We evaluate MACIE across four MARL scenarios: cooperative, competitive, and mixed motive.

However, standard OCP faces two key limitations: it operates in the output space using simple nonconformity (NC) scores, and it treats all historical observations uniformly when estimating quantiles. This paper introduces attention-based feature OCP (AFOCP), which addresses both limitations through two key innovations. First, AFOCP operates in the feature space of pre-trained neural networks, leveraging learned representations to construct more compact prediction sets by concentrating on task-relevant information while suppressing nuisance variation. Second, AFOCP incorporates an attention mechanism that adaptively weights historical observations based on their relevance to the current test point, effectively handling non-stationarity and distribution shifts. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that AFOCP maintains long-term coverage while provably achieving smaller prediction intervals than standard OCP under mild regularity conditions. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world time series datasets demonstrate that AFOCP consistently reduces the size of prediction intervals by as much as $88\\%$ as compared to OCP, while maintaining target coverage levels, validating the benefits of both feature-space calibration and attention-based adaptive weighting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uc801\ud569

Submitted as a full paper for review", "summary": "Generative AI is reshaping offensive cybersecurity by enabling autonomous red team agents that can plan, execute, and adapt during penetration tests. However, existing approaches face trade-offs between generality and specialization, and practical deployments reveal challenges such as hallucinations, context limitations, and ethical concerns. In this work, we introduce a novel command & control (C2) architecture leveraging the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to coordinate distributed, adaptive reconnaissance agents covertly across networks. Notably, we find that our architecture not only improves goal-directed behavior of the system as whole, but also eliminates key host and network artifacts that can be used to detect and prevent command & control behavior altogether. We begin with a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art generative red teaming methods, from fine-tuned specialist models to modular or agentic frameworks, analyzing their automation capabilities against task-specific accuracy. We then detail how our MCP-based C2 can overcome current limitations by enabling asynchronous, parallel operations and real-time intelligence sharing without periodic beaconing. We furthermore explore advanced adversarial capabilities of this architecture, its detection-evasion techniques, and address dual-use ethical implications, proposing defensive measures and controlled evaluation in lab settings. Experimental comparisons with traditional C2 show drastic reductions in manual effort and detection footprint. We conclude with future directions for integrating autonomous exploitation, defensive LLM agents, predictive evasive maneuvers, and multi-agent swarms. The proposed MCP-enabled C2 framework demonstrates a significant step toward realistic, AI-driven red team operations that can simulate advanced persistent threats while informing the development of next-generation defensive systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Generative AI\ub294 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \ubcc0\ubaa8\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ubcf8

However, most existing black-box jailbreak attacks rely on hand-crafted heuristics or narrow search spaces, which limit scalability. Compared with prior attacks, we propose Game-Theory Attack (GTA), an scalable black-box jailbreak framework. Concretely, we formalize the attacker's interaction against safety-aligned LLMs as a finite-horizon, early-stoppable sequential stochastic game, and reparameterize the LLM's randomized outputs via quantal response. Building on this, we introduce a behavioral conjecture \"template-over-safety flip\": by reshaping the LLM's effective objective through game-theoretic scenarios, the originally safety preference may become maximizing scenario payoffs within the template, which weakens safety constraints in specific contexts. We validate this mechanism with classical game such as the disclosure variant of the Prisoner's Dilemma, and we further introduce an Attacker Agent that adaptively escalates pressure to increase the ASR. Experiments across multiple protocols and datasets show that GTA achieves over 95% ASR on LLMs such as Deepseek-R1, while maintaining efficiency. Ablations over components, decoding, multilingual settings, and the Agent's core model confirm effectiveness and generalization. Moreover, scenario scaling studies further establish scalability. GTA also attains high ASR on other game-theoretic scenarios, and one-shot LLM-generated variants that keep the model mechanism fixed while varying background achieve comparable ASR. Paired with a Harmful-Words Detection Agent that performs word-level insertions, GTA maintains high ASR while lowering detection under prompt-guard models. Beyond benchmarks, GTA jailbreaks real-world LLM applications and reports a longitudinal safety monitoring of popular HuggingFace LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "GTA\ub294 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c

However, the scarcity of high-quality trajectories still hinders the development of stronger LLM agents. Most existing works on multi-turn dialogue synthesis validate correctness only at the trajectory level, which may overlook turn-level errors that can propagate during training and degrade model performance. To address these limitations, we introduce ToolMind, a large-scale, high-quality tool-agentic dataset with 160k synthetic data instances generated using over 20k tools and 200k augmented open-source data instances. Our data synthesis pipeline first constructs a function graph based on parameter correlations and then uses a multi-agent framework to simulate realistic user-assistant-tool interactions. Beyond trajectory-level validation, we employ fine-grained turn-level filtering to remove erroneous or suboptimal steps, ensuring that only high-quality reasoning traces are retained.

Many studies have examined different epidemic models for WSNs, focusing on how malware infections spread given the network's specific properties, including energy limits and node mobility. In this study, an agent-based implementation of the susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered-vaccinated (SEIRV) mathematical model was employed for machine learning (ML) predictions. Using tools such as NetLogo's BehaviorSpace and Python, two epidemic synthetic datasets were generated and prepared for the application of several ML algorithms. Posed as a regression problem, the infected and recovered nodes were predicted, and the performance of these algorithms is compared using the error metrics of the train and test sets. The predictions performed well, with low error metrics and high R^2 values (0.997, 1.000, 0.999, 1.000), indicating an effective fit to the training set. The validation values were lower (0.992, 0.998, 0.971, and 0.999), as is typical when evaluating model performance on unseen data. Based on the recorded performances, support vector, linear, Lasso, Ridge, and ElasticNet regression were among the worst-performing algorithms, while Random Forest, XGBoost, Decision Trees, and k-nearest neighbors achieved the best results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ubb34\uc120 \uc13c\uc11c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \uc804\uc5fc\ubcd1 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c ML \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud55c SEIRV \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uad6c\ud604\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubb34\uc120 \uc13c\uc11c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc804\uc5fc\ubcd1 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ubc14\uc774\ub7ec\uc2a4\uc640 \uc6dc\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc704\ud611\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\uace0 \uc644\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud575\uc2ec\uc801\uc778 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "SEIRV \uc218\ud559 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \uad6c\ud604\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \ud569\uc131 \uc804\uc5fc\ubcd1 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uc5ec\ub7ec ML \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc608\uce21\uc740 \ub0ae\uc740 \uc624\ub958 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uacfc \ub192\uc740 R^2 \uac12\uc744 \uae30\ub85d\ud558\uba70 \uc591\ud638\ud55c \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Random Forest, XGBoost, Decision Trees, k-nearest neighbors\uac00 \uac00\uc7a5 \ub192\uc740 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc600\uace0, \uc9c0\uc6d0 \ubca1\ud130, \uc120\ud615 \ud68c\uadc0, Lasso, Ridge, ElasticNet \ud68c\uadc0\ub294 \uc131\uacfc\uac00 \uc800\uc870\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubb34\uc120 \uc13c\uc11c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c(WSNs)\uc5d0\uc11c \uc804\uc5fc\ubcd1 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ubd80\uc871\uc740 \ubc14\uc774\ub7ec\uc2a4 \ubc0f \uc6dc\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc704\ud611\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\uace0 \uc644\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc774\ub2e4. \ub9ce\uc740 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub4e4\uc774 WSN\uc758 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc18d\uc131(\uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \ud55c\uacc4 \ubc0f \ub178\ub4dc \uc774\ub3d9\uc131 \ud3ec\ud568)\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud558\uc5ec \uc545\uc131 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uac10\uc5fc\uc758 \ud655\uc0b0\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8ec \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc804\uc5fc\ubcd1 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5(ML) \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uac10\uc5fc\uc131-\ub178\ucd9c\uc131-\uac10\uc5fc\uc131-\ud68c\ubcf5\uc131-\ubc31\uc2e0 \uc811\uc885(SEIRV) \uc218\ud559 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \uad6c\ud604\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.

Prior work have explored the possibility of directly jailbreaking the embodied agents through elaborated multi-modal prompts. However, no prior work has studied or even reported indirect jailbreaks in embodied AI, where a black-box attacker induces a jailbreak without issuing direct prompts to the embodied agent. In this paper, we propose, for the first time, indirect environmental jailbreak (IEJ), a novel attack to jailbreak embodied AI via indirect prompt injected into the environment, such as malicious instructions written on a wall. Our key insight is that embodied AI does not ''think twice'' about the instructions provided by the environment -- a blind trust that attackers can exploit to jailbreak the embodied agent. We further design and implement open-source prototypes of two fully-automated frameworks: SHAWSHANK, the first automatic attack generation framework for the proposed attack IEJ; and SHAWSHANK-FORGE, the first automatic benchmark generation framework for IEJ. Then, using SHAWSHANK-FORGE, we automatically construct SHAWSHANK-BENCH, the first benchmark for indirectly jailbreaking embodied agents. Together, our two frameworks and one benchmark answer the questions of what content can be used for malicious IEJ instructions, where they should be placed, and how IEJ can be systematically evaluated. Evaluation results show that SHAWSHANK outperforms eleven existing methods across 3,957 task-scene combinations and compromises all six tested VLMs. Furthermore, current defenses only partially mitigate our attack, and we have responsibly disclosed our findings to all affected VLM vendors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uac04\uc811 \ud658\uacbd

Existing self-evolution frameworks offer an alternative but are typically restricted by the model's inherent capabilities and single-round interactions, hindering the development of complex curricula involving tool use or dynamic reasoning. We introduce Agent0, a fully autonomous framework that evolves high-performing agents without external data through multi-step co-evolution and seamless tool integration. Agent0 establishes a symbiotic competition between two agents initialized from the same base LLM: a curriculum agent that proposes increasingly challenging frontier tasks, and an executor agent that learns to solve them. We integrate external tools to enhance the executor's problem-solving capacity; this improvement, in turn, pressures the curriculum agent to construct more complex, tool-aware tasks. Through this iterative process, Agent0 establishes a self-reinforcing cycle that continuously produces high-quality curricula. Empirically, Agent0 substantially boosts reasoning capabilities, improving the Qwen3-8B-Base model by 18% on mathematical reasoning and 24% on general reasoning benchmarks.

Azizul Hakim", "Md Shamse Tabrej"], "title": "Systematically Deconstructing APVD Steganography and its Payload with a Unified Deep Learning Paradigm", "comment": null, "summary": "In the era of digital communication, steganography allows covert embedding of data within media files. Adaptive Pixel Value Differencing (APVD) is a steganographic method valued for its high embedding capacity and invisibility, posing challenges for traditional steganalysis. This paper proposes a deep learning-based approach for detecting APVD steganography and performing reverse steganalysis, which reconstructs the hidden payload. We present a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with an attention mechanism and two output heads for simultaneous stego detection and payload recovery. Trained and validated on 10,000 images from the BOSSbase and UCID datasets, our model achieves a detection accuracy of 96.2 percent. It also reconstructs embedded payloads with up to 93.6 percent recovery at lower embedding densities. Results indicate a strong inverse relationship between payload size and recovery accuracy.

We present MyAntFarm.ai, a reproducible containerized framework demonstrating that multi-agent orchestration fundamentally transforms LLM-based incident response quality. Through 348 controlled trials comparing single-agent copilot versus multi-agent systems on identical incident scenarios, we find that multi-agent orchestration achieves 100% actionable recommendation rate versus 1.7% for single-agent approaches, an 80 times improvement in action specificity and 140 times improvement in solution correctness. Critically, multi-agent systems exhibit zero quality variance across all trials, enabling production SLA commitments impossible with inconsistent single-agent outputs. Both architectures achieve similar comprehension latency (approx.40s), establishing that the architectural value lies in deterministic quality, not speed. We introduce Decision Quality (DQ), a novel metric capturing validity, specificity, and correctness properties essential for operational deployment that existing LLM metrics do not address. These findings reframe multi-agent orchestration from a performance optimization to a production-readiness requirement for LLM-based incident response.

Change-of-basis (CoB) pruning addresses this challenge by applying orthogonal linear transformations that concentrate importance within certain dimensions. However, many standard deep learning architectures are not inherently invariant to such transformations. To enable compatibility, we introduce two-subspace radial activations (TSRAs): an activation family that is invariant to orthogonal linear transformations applied independently within its two activation subspaces. This invariance allows CoB transformations to be merged into surrounding weights without incurring extra parameters. We position this work as a proof-of-concept that a rotationally invariant design may offer a principled approach towards change-of-basis pruning. We do not provide an analysis of multiple TSRA candidates nor do we explore weight initialization for any TSRAs. These limitations, combined with other necessary modifications we make to permit rotational invariance, result in a slight accuracy drop of $4.52\\%$ compared to a ReLU-based control. However, using activation-magnitude importance, VGG-16 implementing our CoB+TSRA framework shows encouraging results on CIFAR-10. Under fixed-ratio structured pruning, CoB improves accuracy over a TSRA baseline at all pruning ratios and extends reliable pruning frontier from roughly $30\\%$ to $70\\%$ of parameters without post-prune fine tuning. Under threshold-based pruning strategies, CoB prunes $90-96\\%$ of parameters while maintaining $1-6\\%$ accuracy drop after fine-tuning. Together, these results indicate that rotationally invariant architectures may offer a promising path towards CoB pruning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ud504\ub8e8\ub2dd\uc740 \uc804\uccb4 \ub274\ub7f0 \ub610\ub294 \ucc44\ub110\uc744 \uc81c\uac70\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uadf8 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub294 \ud45c\ud604 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc774 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub418\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ub2e4\ub985\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, a gap exists in the systematic assessment of supply chain risks associated with the complex web of data sources, pre-trained models, agents, services, and other systems that contribute to the output of modern AI systems. This gap is particularly problematic when AI systems are used in critical applications, such as the food supply, healthcare, utilities, law, insurance, and transport.\n  We survey the current state of AI risk assessment and management, with a focus on the supply chain of AI and risks relating to the behavior and outputs of the AI system.

To address these challenges, we propose ILoRA, a unified framework that integrates three core innovations: a QR-based orthonormal initialization to ensure all clients start in a coherent subspace; a Concatenated QR Aggregation mechanism that fuses heterogeneous-rank updates via concatenation and decomposition, preserving information while maintaining dimension alignment; and an AdamW optimizer with rank-aware control variates to correct local updates and mitigate client drift.

Specialized agents evaluate localization quality, generate Socratic coaching, retrieve PubMed evidence, suggest similar cases from REFLACX, and trigger NV-Reason-CXR-3B for vision-language reasoning when mastery remains low or the learner explicitly asks. Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) maintains skill-specific mastery estimates that drive both knowledge reinforcement and case similarity retrieval.

By learning the underlying probability distribution of the training dataset, deep generative models, such as the diffusion model (DM), can generate high-fidelity synthetic samples that statistically resemble the training data. Such synthetic data generation can significantly enrich the size and diversity of the available training data, and more importantly, improve the robustness of downstream machine learning models in predictive tasks. The objective of this paper is to investigate the effectiveness of DM for overcoming data scarcity in nuclear energy applications. By leveraging a public dataset on critical heat flux (CHF) that cover a wide range of commercial nuclear reactor operational conditions, we developed a DM that can generate an arbitrary amount of synthetic samples for augmenting of the CHF dataset. Since a vanilla DM can only generate samples randomly, we also developed a conditional DM capable of generating targeted CHF data under user-specified thermal-hydraulic conditions. The performance of the DM was evaluated based on their ability to capture empirical feature distributions and pair-wise correlations, as well as to maintain physical consistency. The results showed that both the DM and conditional DM can successfully generate realistic and physics-consistent CHF data. Furthermore, uncertainty quantification was performed to establish confidence in the generated data. The results demonstrated that the conditional DM is highly effective in augmenting CHF data while maintaining acceptable levels of uncertainty.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud575 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc751\uc6a9 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd80\uc871 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378(DM)\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ud06c\uae30\uc640 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uad00\ub828 \uc751\uc6a9 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \uc885\uc885 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ube44\uc2f8\uba70 \uc5bb\uae30 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b0\ubbc0\ub85c, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd80\uc871 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\uacf5\uac1c\ub41c \uc784\uacc4 \uc5f4 \uc720\uc18d(CHF) \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \ubb34\uc791\uc704\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc21c\uc218\ud55c DM \uc678\uc5d0\ub3c4 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc9c0\uc815 \uc5f4\uc720\uccb4 \uc870\uac74 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 CHF \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc870\uac74\ubd80 DM\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "DM\uacfc \uc870\uac74\ubd80 DM \ubaa8\ub450 \uc2e4\uc81c\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc77c\uad00\ub41c CHF \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ub3c4 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc5ec \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc870\uac74\ubd80 DM\uc740 CHF \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc99d\uac15\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc218\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub525 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc740 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \uc885\uc885 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4e4\uac70\ub098 \uc5bb\uae30 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uad00\ub828 \uc751\uc6a9 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd80\uc871 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub525 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378, \uc608\ub97c \ub4e4\uc5b4 \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378(DM)\uc740 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc758 \uae30\ucd08 \ud655\ub960 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\uc0ac\ud558\uac8c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uace0\ucda9\uc2e4\ub3c4 \ud569\uc131 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc0dd\uc131\uc740 \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ud06c\uae30\uc640 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ub354 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uac83\uc740 \uc608\uce21 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud558\uc704 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc758 \ubaa9\uc801\uc740 \ud575 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc751\uc6a9 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd80\uc871\uc744 \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 DM\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc0c1\uc5c5\uc6a9 \ud575 \ubc1c\uc804\uc18c\uc758 \uc6b4\uc804 \uc870\uac74\uc744 \ud3ec\uad04\ud558\ub294 \uc784\uacc4 \uc5f4 \uc720\uc18d(CHF)\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uacf5\uac1c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 CHF \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc99d\uac15\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc784\uc758\uc758 \uc591\uc758 \ud569\uc131 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 DM\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc21c\uc218\ud55c DM\uc740 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \ubb34\uc791\uc704\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\ubbc0\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub610\ud55c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc9c0\uc815 \uc5f4\uc720\uccb4 \uc870\uac74 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa9\ud45c\ud558\ub294 CHF \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc870\uac74\ubd80 DM\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.

Practical domains, such as business management, require optimizing an open-ended and multi-faceted objective, actively learning environment dynamics from sparse experience, planning over long horizons in stochastic settings, and reasoning over spatial information. Yet existing human--AI benchmarks isolate subsets of these capabilities, limiting our ability to assess holistic decision-making competence. We introduce Mini Amusement Parks (MAPs), an amusement-park simulator designed to evaluate an agent's ability to model its environment, anticipate long-term consequences under uncertainty, and strategically operate a complex business. We provide human baselines and a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLM agents, finding that humans outperform these systems by 6.5x on easy mode and 9.8x on medium mode. Our analysis reveals persistent weaknesses in long-horizon optimization, sample-efficient learning, spatial reasoning, and world modelling. By unifying these challenges within a single environment, MAPs offers a new foundation for benchmarking agents capable of adaptable decision making.

To evaluate and enhance this capability, the pass@k metric, which measures the probability of obtaining at least one correct solution in k independent samples, has received significant attention. Its intuitive appeal has led to its adoption not only as an evaluation standard but also as a direct optimization objective in reinforcement learning. In this paper, we analyze the pass@k objective, derive its gradient, and demonstrate that it is fundamentally a per-example positive reweighting of the simpler pass@1 objective. Our analysis reveals that the pass@k objective provides a vanishing learning signal in regimes where exploration is most critical. We further analyze the dynamics of \"exploration collapse\", showing that as the policy concentrates probability mass, the gap between pass@k and pass@1 diminishes. We conclude that while pass@k is a useful diagnostic tool, it may be an unsuitable direct objective for optimization. Instead, mechanisms explicitly encouraging efficient exploration could offer a more effective path forward for reinforcement learning in reasoning tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 pass@k \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc758 \ubd84\uc11d\uacfc \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c\uc11c\uc758 \uc801\ud569\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub17c\uc758\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ubaa8\uc0c9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "pass@k \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc758 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c pass@1 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc758 \uac1c\ubcc4 \uc0d8\ud50c \uae0d\uc815 \uc7ac\uac00\uc911\uce58\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "exploration collapse\uc758 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc5ec pass@k\uc640 pass@1 \uac04\uc758 \uaca9\ucc28\uac00 \ucd95\uc801 \ud655\ub960 \uc9c8\ub7c9\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc904\uc5b4\ub4e6\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "pass@k\ub294 \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c \uc9c4\ub2e8 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc758 \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc778 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c\ub294 \ubd80\uc801\ud569\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\ub294 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774 \ub354 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc774 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc740 \ud604\ub300 AI \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \uc911\uc2ec \uc8fc\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uac15\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 k\uac1c\uc758 \ub3c5\ub9bd \uc0d8\ud50c\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc18c\ud55c \ud558\ub098\uc758 \uc62c\ubc14\ub978 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc5bb\uc744 \ud655\ub960\uc744 \uce21\uc815\ud558\ub294 pass@k \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc774 \uc8fc\ubaa9\ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc758 \uc9c1\uad00\uc801 \ub9e4\ub825\uc740 \ud3c9\uac00 \uae30\uc900\ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc778 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c\ub3c4 \ucc44\ud0dd\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 pass@k \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uba70, \uadf8\uac83\uc774 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub354 \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c pass@1 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc758 \uac1c\ubcc4 \uc608\uc2dc \uae0d\uc815\uc801 \uc7ac\uac00\uc911\uce58\ub77c\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubd84\uc11d\uc740 pass@k \ubaa9\ud45c\uac00 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc774 \uac00\uc7a5 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc601\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c \ud559\uc2b5 \uc2e0\ud638\uac00 \uc0ac\ub77c\uc9d0\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c4\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c '\ud0d0\uc0c9 \ubd95\uad34'\uc758 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\ucc45\uc774 \ud655\ub960 \uc9c8\ub7c9\uc744 \uc9d1\uc911\uc2dc\ud0ac\uc218\ub85d pass@k\uc640 pass@1 \uac04\uc758 \uaca9\ucc28\uac00 \uc904\uc5b4\ub4e0\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 pass@k\uac00 \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c \uc9c4\ub2e8 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc758 \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc778 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c\ub294 \uc801\ud569\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ub300\uc2e0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc7a5\ub824\ud558\ub294 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774 \ucd94\ub860 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ub354 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uacb0\ub860\ub0b4\ub9bd\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Rather than relying solely on final answer correctness, our approach leverages fine grained uncertainty signals: 1) self-assessed confidence alignment, and 2) token-level entropy spikes to detect unreliable and unfaithful reasoning in real time. We design a composite reward function that penalizes unjustified high confidence and entropy spikes, while encouraging stable and accurate reasoning trajectories. These signals guide a reinforcement learning (RL) policy that makes the model more introspective and shapes the model's generation behavior through confidence-aware reward feedback, improving not just outcome correctness but the coherence and faithfulness of their intermediate reasoning steps. Experiments show that our method improves both final answer accuracy and reasoning calibration, with ablations validating the individual contribution of each signal.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ucd94\ub860 \ub3d9\uc548 \ud658\uc0c1\uc744 \uac10\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \uc644\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc790\uae30 \uad50\uc815 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uace0, \uc911\uac04 \ucd94\ub860\uc758 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uacfc \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "\uc790\uae30 \ud3c9\uac00\ub41c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub3c4 \uc815\ub82c\uacfc \ud1a0\ud070 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \uae09\uc99d\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\uace0, \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc774\uba70 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\ub294 \ubcf5\ud569 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ucd5c\uc885 \ub2f5\uc548\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uacfc \ucd94\ub860 \ubcf4\uc815\uc744 \ubaa8\ub450 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uba70 \uac01 \uc2e0\ud638\uc758 \uac1c\ubcc4 \uae30\uc5ec\ub3c4\ub97c \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uacb0\uacfc\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uc911\uac04 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc758 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uacfc \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf30\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \ud504\ub85c\uc81d\ud2b8\ub294 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ucd94\ub860 \uc911\uc5d0 \ud658\uc0c1\uc744 \uac10\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \uc644\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc790\uae30 \uad50\uc815 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uc885 \ub2f5\uc548\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\ub9cc\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc138\ubc00\ud55c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: 1) \uc790\uae30 \ud3c9\uac00\ub41c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub3c4 \uc815\ub82c, 2) \ud1a0\ud070 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \uae09\uc99d\uc73c\ub85c \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\uace0 \ube44\uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uc788\ub294 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc815\ub2f9\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ub192\uc740 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub3c4\uc640 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \uae09\uc99d\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubc8c\uc810\uc744 \ubd80\uacfc\ud558\uace0 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc774\uba70 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc7a5\ub824\ud558\ub294 \ubcf5\ud569 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \uc124\uacc4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc2e0\ud638\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ub354 \ub0b4\uc131\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub9cc\ub4e4\uace0 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub3c4 \uc778\uc2dd \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc0dd\uc131 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud615\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL) \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc548\ub0b4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ub2e8\uc9c0 \uacb0\uacfc\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uc911\uac04 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc758 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uacfc \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc6b0\ub9ac \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ucd5c\uc885 \ub2f5\uc548\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uacfc \ucd94\ub860 \ubcf4\uc815\uc744 \ubaa8\ub450 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uba70, \uac01 \uc2e0\ud638\uc758 \uac1c\ubcc4 \uae30\uc5ec\ub3c4\ub97c \uac80\uc99d\ud558\ub294_ablation_ \uc5f0\uad6c\uac00 \uc785\uc99d\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, recent generative models lack physical foundation and temporal reasoning required for clinical decision support. As scaling language models show diminishing returns for grounded clinical reasoning, world models are gaining traction because they learn multimodal, temporally coherent, and action-conditioned representations that reflect the physical and causal structure of care. This paper reviews World Models for healthcare systems that learn predictive dynamics to enable multistep rollouts, counterfactual evaluation and planning. We survey recent work across three domains: (i) medical imaging and diagnostics (e.g., longitudinal tumor simulation, projection-transition modeling, and Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture i.e., JEPA-style predictive representation learning), (ii) disease progression modeling from electronic health records (generative event forecasting at scale), and (iii) robotic surgery and surgical planning (action-conditioned guidance and control). We also introduce a capability rubric: L1 temporal prediction, L2 action-conditioned prediction, L3 counterfactual rollouts for decision support, and L4 planning/control. Most reviewed systems achieve L1--L2, with fewer instances of L3 and rare L4. We identify cross-cutting gaps that limit clinical reliability; under-specified action spaces and safety constraints, weak interventional validation, incomplete multimodal state construction, and limited trajectory-level uncertainty calibration. This review outlines a research agenda for clinically robust prediction-first world models that integrate generative backbones (transformers, diffusion, VAE) with causal/mechanical foundation for safe

Prior work on LLM-as-a-judge frameworks typically relies on comparing candidate answers against ground-truth labels or other candidate answers using predefined metrics like entailment. However, this approach is inherently indirect and difficult to fully automate, offering limited support for fine-grained and scalable evaluation of reasoning outputs. In this work, we propose JudgeBoard, a novel evaluation pipeline that directly queries models to assess the correctness of candidate answers without requiring extra answer comparisons. We focus on two core reasoning domains: mathematical reasoning and science/commonsense reasoning, and construct task-specific evaluation leaderboards using both accuracy-based ranking and an Elo-based rating system across five benchmark datasets, enabling consistent model comparison as judges rather than comparators. To improve judgment performance in lightweight models, we propose MAJ (Multi-Agent Judging), a novel multi-agent evaluation framework that leverages multiple interacting SLMs with distinct reasoning profiles to approximate LLM-level judgment accuracy through collaborative deliberation. Experimental results reveal a significant performance gap between SLMs and LLMs in isolated judging tasks. However, our MAJ framework substantially improves the reliability and consistency of SLMs. On the MATH dataset, MAJ using smaller-sized models as backbones performs comparatively well or even better than their larger-sized counterparts. Our findings highlight that multi-agent SLM systems can potentially match or exceed LLM performance in judgment tasks, with implications for scalable and efficient assessment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc791\uc740 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(SLM)\uc774 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec \ub2f5\ubcc0\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc778 JudgeBoard\uc640 MAJ\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "SLM\uc758 \ub2f5\ubcc0 \uc815\ud655\uc131 \ud310\ub2e8 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 LLM\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud558\uba70, \uae30\uc874 LLM \ud3c9\uac00 \uccb4\uacc4\ub294 \uac04\uc811\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\uac00 \uc5b4\ub835\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "JudgeBoard\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud3c9\uac00 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud6c4\ubcf4 \ub2f5\ubcc0\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \uc9c1\uc811 \uc9c8\uc758\ud558\uace0, MAJ \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 SLM\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud611\ub825\uc801\uc778 \uc2ec\uc758\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 LLM \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ud310\ub2e8 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \uadfc\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc SLM\uacfc LLM \uc0ac\uc774\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \ucc28\uc774\uac00 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0ac\uc73c\ub098, MAJ \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 SLM\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uacfc \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 SLM \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \ud310\ub2e8 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c LLM \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ub9de\ucd9c \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ud3c9\uac00\uc758 \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uacfc \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2dc\uc0ac\uc810\uc744 \uac00\uc9d1\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc791\uc740 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(SLM)\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc73c\ub098, \ub2f5\ubcc0\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ud310\ub2e8\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

To address these challenges, we propose KRAL (Knowledge and Reasoning Augmented Learning), a low-cost, scalable, privacy-preserving paradigm that leverages teacher-model reasoning to automatically distill knowledge and reasoning trajectories via answer-to-question reverse generation, employs heuristic learning for semi-supervised data augmentation (reducing manual annotation requirements by approximately 80%), and utilizes agentic reinforcement learning to jointly enhance medical knowledge and reasoning while optimizing computational and memory efficiency. A hierarchical evaluation employing diverse teacher-model proxies reduces assessment costs, while modular interface design facilitates seamless system updates. Experimental results demonstrate that KRAL significantly outperforms traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) methods. It improves knowledge question-answering capability (Accuracy@1 on the external open-source benchmark MEDQA increased by 1.8% vs. SFT and 3.6% vs. RAG) and reasoning capability (Pass@1 on the external benchmark PUMCH Antimicrobial increased by 27% vs. SFT and 27.2% vs. RAG), achieved at ~20% of SFT's long-term training costs.

However, leveraging such data presents significant challenges due to irregular sampling, complex latent physiology, and inherent uncertainties in both measurements and disease progression. To address these challenges, we propose a generative modeling framework based on latent neural stochastic differential equations (SDEs) that views clinical time series as discrete-time partial observations of an underlying controlled stochastic dynamical system. Our approach models latent dynamics via neural SDEs with modality-dependent emission models, while performing state estimation and parameter learning through variational inference. This formulation naturally handles irregularly sampled observations, learns complex non-linear interactions, and captures the stochasticity of disease progression and measurement noise within a unified scalable probabilistic framework. We validate the framework on two complementary tasks: (i) individual treatment effect estimation using a simulated pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) model of lung cancer, and (ii) probabilistic forecasting of physiological signals using real-world intensive care unit (ICU) data from 12,000 patients. Results show that our framework outperforms ordinary differential equation and long short-term memory baseline models in accuracy and uncertainty estimation. These results highlight its potential for enabling precise, uncertainty-aware predictions to support clinical decision-making.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc804\uc790 \uac74\uac15

We present a novel dual-method detection system combining semantic drift analysis with canary baseline comparison to identify backdoored LLMs in real-time. Our approach uses Sentence-BERT embeddings to measure semantic deviation from safe baselines, complemented by injected canary questions that monitor response consistency. Evaluated on the official Cadenza-Labs dolphin-llama3-8B sleeper agent model, our system achieves 92.5% accuracy with 100% precision (zero false positives) and 85% recall. The combined detection method operates in real-time (<1s per query), requires no model modification, and provides the first practical solution to LLM backdoor detection.

We investigate a proof of concept for an artificial palpation method based on self-supervised learning. Our key idea is that an encoder-decoder framework can learn a $\\textit{representation}$ from a sequence of tactile measurements that contains all the relevant information about the palpated object. We conjecture that such a representation can be used for downstream tasks such as tactile imaging and change detection. With enough training data, it should capture intricate patterns in the tactile measurements that go beyond a simple map of forces -- the current state of the art. To validate our approach, we both develop a simulation environment and collect a real-world dataset of soft objects and corresponding ground truth images obtained by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We collect palpation sequences using a robot equipped with a tactile sensor, and train a model that predicts sensory readings at different positions on the object. We investigate the representation learned in this process, and demonstrate its use in imaging and change detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc790\uae30 \uc9c0\ub3c4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc778\uacf5 \ucd09\uc9c4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \ucd09\uac01 \uce21\uc815\uc758 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uac1d\uccb4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uc751\uc6a9\uc744 \uac80\ud1a0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc758\ub8cc \uac80\uc0ac\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd09\uc9c4\uc740 \uc778\uac04\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc218\ud589\ub418\uba70, \uc778\uacf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\ub97c \uad6c\ud604\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ubaa8\uc0c9\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc778\ucf54\ub354-\ub514\ucf54\ub354 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ucd09\uac01 \uce21\uc815 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uac1d\uccb4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \ub85c\ubd07\uc5d0 \ucd09\uac01 \uc13c\uc11c\ub97c \uc7a5\ucc29\ud558\uc5ec \ucd09\uc9c4 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\ub97c \uc218\uc9d1\ud558\uace0, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc704\uce58\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uac10\uac01\uc801 \ub3c5\uc11c\ub97c \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud559\uc2b5\ud55c \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ud574\uc11d\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ud654 \ubc0f \ubcc0\ud654 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ucda9\ubd84\ud55c \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uba74 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ucea1\ucc98\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ud798 \ub9f5\uc744 \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\ub294 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd09\uc9c4\uc740 \uc758\ub8cc \uac80\uc0ac\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ucd09\uac01 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c, \uac70\uc758 \uc804\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\uac04\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc218\ud589\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc790\uae30 \uc9c0\ub3c4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc778\uacf5 \ucd09\uc9c4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac1c\ub150 \uc99d\uba85\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec \uc544\uc774\ub514\uc5b4\ub294 \uc778\ucf54\ub354-\ub514\ucf54\ub354 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 \ucd09\ucd09\ud55c \ubb3c\uccb4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uad00\ub828 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \ucd09\uac01 \uce21\uc815 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 $\textit{\ud45c\ud604}$\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud45c\ud604\uc740 \ucd09\uac01 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ud654 \ubc0f \ubcc0\ud654 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ub2e4\uc6b4\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9bc \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4\uace0 \ucd94\uce21\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucda9\ubd84\ud55c \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4\uba74, \uc774\ub294 \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uae30\uc220\uc778 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \ud798 \ub9f5\uc744 \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\ub294 \ucd09\uac01 \uce21\uc815\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud574\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uace0 \uc790\uae30 \uacf5\uba85 \uc601\uc0c1(MRI)\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc5bb\uc5b4\uc9c4 \ubd80\ub4dc\ub7ec\uc6b4 \ubb3c\uccb4\uc640 \ud574\ub2f9 \uae30\uc900 \uc9c4\uc2e4 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \uc218\uc9d1\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ucd09\uac01 \uc13c\uc11c\ub97c \uc7a5\ucc29\ud55c \ub85c\ubd07\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ucd09\uc9c4 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\ub97c \uc218\uc9d1\ud558\uace0, \ubb3c\uccb4\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc704\uce58\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uac10\uac01\uc801 \ub3c5\uc11c\ub97c \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ud654 \ubc0f \ubcc0\ud654 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, its use as a core gameplay co-creation tool remains underexplored. Objective: This paper proposes SpellForger, a game where players create custom spells by writing natural language prompts, aiming to provide a unique experience of personalization and creativity. Methodology: The system uses a supervisedtrained BERT model to interpret player prompts. This model maps textual descriptions to one of many spell prefabs and balances their parameters (damage, cost, effects) to ensure competitive integrity. The game is developed in the Unity Game Engine, and the AI backend is in Python.

Stratopoulos", "Victor Xiaoqi Wang"], "title": "Artificial Intelligence and Accounting Research: A Framework and Agenda", "comment": "48 pages, 7 tables", "summary": "Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly generative AI (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs), are fundamentally transforming accounting research, creating both opportunities and competitive threats for scholars. This paper proposes a framework that classifies AI-accounting research along two dimensions: research focus (accounting-centric versus AI-centric) and methodological approach (AI-based versus traditional methods). We apply this framework to papers from the IJAIS special issue and recent AI-accounting research published in leading accounting journals to map existing studies and identify research opportunities. Using this same framework, we analyze how accounting researchers can leverage their expertise through strategic positioning and collaboration, revealing where accounting scholars' strengths create the most value. We further examine how GenAI and LLMs transform the research process itself, comparing the capabilities of human researchers and AI agents across the entire research workflow. This analysis reveals that while GenAI democratizes certain research capabilities, it simultaneously intensifies competition by raising expectations for higher-order contributions where human judgment, creativity, and theoretical depth remain valuable. These shifts call for reforming doctoral education to cultivate comparative advantages while building AI fluency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc774 \ud68c\uacc4 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0 \uc5f0\uad6c \uae30\ud68c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5, \ud2b9\ud788 \uc0dd\uc131\uc801 AI\uc640 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud68c\uacc4 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0 \uc5f0\uad6c \uae30\ud68c\ub97c \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "AI-\ud68c\uacc4 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc5f0\uad6c \ucd08\uc810\uacfc \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc801 \uc811\uadfc\uc131\uc744 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ub958\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \uae30\uc874 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\ud68c\uc640 \uac15\uc810\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud68c\uacc4 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc790\ub4e4\uc774 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \ud3ec\uc9c0\uc154\ub2dd\uacfc \ud611\ub825\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc804\ubb38\uc131\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\uc548\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0, \uc778\uac04 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc790\uc640 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \ube44\uad50\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5f0\uad6c \uacfc\uc815\uc758 \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \uad6c\uccb4\ud654\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "AI\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \uc5f0\uad6c \uacfc\uc815\uc758 \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \uac00\uc838\uc624\uace0 doctoral \uad50\uc721 \uac1c\ud601\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5, \ud2b9\ud788 \uc0dd\uc131\uc801 AI(GenAI) \ubc0f \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \ud68c\uacc4 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud654\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ud559\uc790\ub4e4\uc5d0\uac8c \uae30\ud68c\uc640 \uacbd\uc7c1 \uc704\ud611\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 AI-\ud68c\uacc4 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc5f0\uad6c \ucd08\uc810(\ud68c\uacc4 \uc911\uc2ec \ub300 AI \uc911\uc2ec)\uacfc \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc801 \uc811\uadfc(AI \uae30\ubc18 \ub300 \uc804\ud1b5 \ubc29\ubc95)\uc758 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ub958\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c IJAIS \ud2b9\ubcc4\ud638\uc758 \ub17c\ubb38\ub4e4\uacfc \ucd5c\uadfc \uc8fc\uc694 \ud68c\uacc4 \uc800\ub110\uc5d0 \uac8c\uc7ac\ub41c AI-\ud68c\uacc4 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\uc874 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ub9f5\ud551\ud558\uace0 \uc5f0\uad6c \uae30\ud68c\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac19\uc740 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud68c\uacc4 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc790\ub4e4\uc774 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \ud3ec\uc9c0\uc154\ub2dd\uacfc \ud611\ub825\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc804\ubb38\uc131\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uba70, \ud68c\uacc4 \ud559\uc790\ub4e4\uc774 \uac00\uc7a5 \uac00\uce58\ub97c \ucc3d\ucd9c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac15\uc810\uc744 \ubc1d\ud799\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c GenAI\uc640 LLM\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c \uacfc\uc815 \uc790\uccb4\ub97c \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ubcc0\ud654\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294\uc9c0 \uc0b4\ud3b4\ubcf4\uba70, \uc5f0\uad6c \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0 \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc778\uac04 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc790\uc640 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ube44\uad50\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubd84\uc11d\uc740 GenAI\uac00 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc5f0\uad6c \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubbfc\uc8fc\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ud55c\ud3b8, \uc778\uac04\uc758 \ud310\ub2e8, \ucc3d\uc758\uc131 \ubc0f \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uae4a\uc774\uac00 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uacf3\uc5d0\uc11c \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \uae30\uc5ec\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uae30\ub300\ub97c \ub192\uc784\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uacbd\uc7c1\uc744 \uc2ec\ud654\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc1d\ud600\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubcc0\ud654\ub294 AI \uc720\ucc3d\uc131\uc744 \uac16\ucd94\uba74\uc11c \ube44\uad50 \uc6b0\uc704\ub97c \ud0a4\uc6b0\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubc15\uc0ac \uad50\uc721 \uac1c\ud601\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud568\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

The problem with relying on static thresholds is that we are either overspending for more resources than needed or have reduced performance because of their lack. This is why we work on proactive solutions. A framework developed for it stops reacting to the problems but starts expecting them. We design a hybrid architecture, combining two powerful tools: the CNN LSTM model for time series forecasting and an orchestrator based on multi agent Deep Reinforcement Learning In fact the novelty is in how we combine them as we embed the predictive forecast from the CNN LSTM directly into the DRL agent state space. That is what makes the AI manager smarter it sees the future, which allows it to make better decisions about a long term plan for where to run tasks That means finding that sweet spot between how much money is saved while keeping the system healthy and apps fast for users That is we have given it eyes in order to see down the road so that it does not have to lurch from one problem to another it

It provides efficient asynchronous dispatching, lightweight tool integration, and flexible backend interoperability, enabling seamless use with existing RL frameworks such as SkyRL-train, VeRL, and Tinker.\n  Using SkyRL-Agent, we train SA-SWE-32B, a software engineering agent trained from Qwen3-32B (24.4% Pass@1) purely with reinforcement learning. We introduce two key components: an optimized asynchronous pipeline dispatcher that achieves a 1.55x speedup over naive asynchronous batching, and a tool-enhanced training recipe leveraging an AST-based search tool to facilitate code navigation, boost rollout Pass@K, and improve training efficiency. Together, these optimizations enable SA-SWE-32B to reach 39.4% Pass@1 on SWE-Bench Verified with more than 2x cost reduction compared to prior models reaching similar performance. Despite being trained solely on SWE tasks, SA-SWE-32B generalizes effectively to other agentic tasks, including Terminal-Bench, BrowseComp-Plus, and WebArena.

The annotation of structured sequences of events (who does what, when, and where) used for soccer analytics requires a holistic approach that integrates both STAD and MOT. However, current action recognition methods remain insufficient for constructing reliable play-by-play data and are typically used to assist rather than fully automate annotation. Parallel research has advanced tactical modeling, trajectory forecasting, and performance analysis, all grounded in game-state and play-by-play data. This motivates leveraging tactical knowledge as a prior to support computer-vision-based predictions, enabling more automated and reliable extraction of play-by-play data. We introduce Footovision Play-by-Play Action Spotting in Soccer Dataset (FOOTPASS), the first benchmark for play-by-play action spotting over entire soccer matches in a multi-modal, multi-agent tactical context. It enables the development of methods for player-centric action spotting that exploit both outputs from computer-vision tasks (e.g., tracking, identification) and prior knowledge of soccer, including its tactical regularities over long time horizons, to generate reliable play-by-play data streams.

Conventional reward models struggle to jointly optimize multiple, sometimes conflicting, preference dimensions (e.g., factuality, helpfulness, safety) and offer limited transparency into why a score is assigned. CRM addresses these issues by decomposing preference evaluation into domain-specific agents that each produce partial signals, alongside global evaluators such as ranker-based and embedding-similarity rewards. A centralized aggregator fuses these signals at each timestep, balancing factors like step-wise correctness, multi-agent agreement, and repetition penalties, yielding a single training reward compatible with standard RL pipelines. The policy is optimized with advantage-based updates (e.g., GAE), while a value model regresses to the aggregated reward, enabling multi-perspective reward shaping without requiring additional human annotations beyond those used to train the evaluators. To support training and assessment, we introduce rewardBench, a benchmark and training suite aligned with the collaborative structure of CRM. Together, CRM and rewardBench provide a practical, modular path to more transparent reward modeling and more stable optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "CRM\uc740 RLHF\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uacac\uace0\uc131\uacfc \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud611\ub825 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uacbd\uc7c1\uc801\uc778 \uc120\ud638 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc810\uc218\uac00 \ubd80\uc5ec\ub418\ub294 \uc774\uc720\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud22c\uba85\uc131\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc120\ud638 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\uc5ec \uac01\uac01 \ubd80\ubd84 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uc911\uc2dd \uc9d1\uacc4\uc790\uac00 \uac01 \uc2dc\uac04 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc735\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud558\ub098\uc758 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uc815\ucc45\uc740 \uc774 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uc5ec \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub418\uba70, \uac00\uce58 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc9d1\uacc4\ub41c \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ud68c\uadc0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "CRM\uacfc rewardBench\ub294 \ub354 \ud22c\uba85\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \ubc0f \ub354 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc2dd \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 RLHF\uc5d0\uc11c \uacac\uace0\uc131\uacfc \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub2e8\uc77c \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc804\ubb38 \ud3c9\uac00\uc790 \ud300\uc73c\ub85c \ub300\uccb4\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 CRM(\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud611\ub825 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubaa8\ub378)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ucc28\uc6d0\uc758 \uc120\ud638(\uc608: \uc0ac\uc2e4\uc131, \uc720\uc6a9\uc131, \uc548\uc804\uc131)\ub97c \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc810\uc218\uac00 \ubd80\uc5ec\ub418\ub294 \uc774\uc720\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud22c\uba85\uc131\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.

We introduce ChemO, a new benchmark built from the International Chemistry Olympiad (IChO) 2025. ChemO features two key innovations for automated assessment: Assessment-Equivalent Reformulation (AER), which converts problems requiring visual outputs (e.g., drawing molecules) into computationally tractable formats, and Structured Visual Enhancement (SVE), a diagnostic mechanism to disentangle a model's visual perception capabilities from its core chemical reasoning. To tackle this benchmark, we propose ChemLabs, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that mimics human expert collaboration through specialized agents for problem decomposition, perception, reasoning, and auditing. Experiments on state-of-the-art multimodal models demonstrate that combining SVE with our multi-agent system yields dramatic performance gains. Our top configuration achieves a score of 93.6 out of 100, surpassing an estimated human gold medal threshold and establishing a new state-of-the-art in automated chemical problem-solving.

We make threefold contributions. First, we conduct a comprehensive empirical analysis and uncover that item lifecycles in short-video platforms follow a compressed three-phase pattern, i.e., rapid growth, transient stability, and sharp decay, which significantly deviates from the classical four-stage model (introduction, growth, maturity, decline). Second, we introduce LHRL, a lifecycle-aware hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that dynamically harmonizes fairness and accuracy by leveraging phase-specific exposure dynamics. LHRL consists of two key components: (1) PhaseFormer, a lightweight encoder combining STL decomposition and attention mechanisms for robust phase detection; (2) a two-level HRL agent, where the high-level policy imposes phase-aware fairness constraints, and the low-level policy optimizes immediate user engagement. This decoupled optimization allows for effective reconciliation between long-term equity and short-term utility.

The prototype explores how multiple organisations (represented here as a Clinic, Insurer, and Specialist Network) can cooperate securely via pseudonymised case tokens, local data lookups, and controlled operational boundaries.\n  The system uses Orpius as the underlying platform for multi-agent orchestration, tool execution, and privacy-preserving communication. All agents communicate through OperationRelay calls, exchanging concise natural-language summaries. Each agent operates on its own data (such as synthetic clinic records, insurance enrolment tables, and clinical guidance extracts), and none receives or reconstructs patient identity. The Clinic computes an HMAC-based pseudonymous token, the Insurer evaluates coverage rules and consults the Specialist agent, and the Specialist returns an appropriateness recommendation.\n  The goal of this prototype is intentionally limited: to demonstrate feasibility, not to provide a clinically validated, production-ready system. No clinician review was conducted, and no evaluation beyond basic functional runs was performed. The work highlights architectural patterns, privacy considerations, and communication flows that enable distributed reasoning among specialised agents while keeping data local to each organisation. We conclude by outlining opportunities for more rigorous evaluation and future research in decentralised multi-agent systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubd84\uc0b0

However, a major open question is how to validate that the generated models are correct and satisfy the requirements defined in the natural language description. In this work, we propose a novel agent-based method for automatic validation of optimization models that builds upon and extends methods from software testing to address optimization modeling . This method consists of several agents that initially generate a problem-level testing API, then generate tests utilizing this API, and, lastly, generate mutations specific to the optimization model (a well-known software testing technique assessing the fault detection power of the test suite). In this work, we detail this validation framework and show, through experiments, the high quality of validation provided by this agent ensemble in terms of the well-known software testing measure called mutation coverage.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uc124\uba85\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc790\ub3d9 \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uc5ec, \ubb38\uc81c \uc218\uc900 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud305 API\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uc774 API\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uba70, \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ud2b9\ud654\ub41c \ubcc0\uc774\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc9d1\ud569\uc774 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \ub192\uc740 \ud488\uc9c8\uc758 \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc798 \uc54c\ub824\uc9c4 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc9c0\ud45c\uc778 \ubcc0\uc774 \uc801\uc6a9\ub960 \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \ub192\uc740 \uac80\uc99d \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uc124\uba85\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc810\uc810 \uc778\uae30\ub97c \ub04c\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc62c\ubc14\ub974\uba70 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uc124\uba85\uc5d0 \uc815\uc758\ub41c \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \ub9cc\uc871\ud558\ub294\uc9c0 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc9c8\ubb38\uc73c\ub85c \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc790\ub3d9 \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd9c\ubc1c\ud574 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8ec\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 API\ub97c \ucc98\uc74c \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c \ub2e4\uc74c \uc774 API\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uba70, \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ud2b9\ud654\ub41c \ubcc0\uc774\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\ub2e4(\uc774\ub294 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ubaa8\uc74c\uc758 \uacb0\ud568 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uc798 \uc54c\ub824\uc9c4 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc95\uc774\ub2e4). \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774 \uac80\uc99d \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc790\uc138\ud788 \uc124\uba85\ud558\uace0 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubcc0\uc774 \uc801\uc6a9\ub960\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc798 \uc54c\ub824\uc9c4 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uce21\uc815 \uc9c0\ud45c \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc9d1\ud569\uc774 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \uac80\uc99d\uc758 \ub192\uc740 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4."}}

However, their inherent tendency toward hallucination often introduces functional errors into the generated HDL designs. To address this issue, we propose the framework CorrectHDL that leverages high-level synthesis (HLS) results as functional references to correct potential errors in LLM-generated HDL designs.The input to the proposed framework is a C/C++ program that specifies the target circuit's functionality. The program is provided to an LLM to directly generate an HDL design, whose syntax errors are repaired using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism. The functional correctness of the LLM-generated circuit is iteratively improved by comparing its simulated behavior with an HLS reference design produced by conventional HLS tools, which ensures the functional correctness of the result but can lead to suboptimal area and power efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that circuits generated by the proposed framework achieve significantly better area and power efficiency than conventional HLS designs and approach the quality of human-engineered circuits. Meanwhile, the correctness of the resulting HDL implementation is maintained, highlighting the effectiveness and potential of agentic HDL design leveraging the generative capabilities of LLMs and the rigor of traditional correctness-driven IC design flows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uc124\uba85 \uc5b8\uc5b4(HDL)\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uc804\uba74 \uc124\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc790\uc8fc \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \ud658\uac01\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c HDL \uc124\uacc4\uc5d0 \uae30\ub2a5\uc801 \uc624\ub958\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc81c\uc548\ub41c CorrectHDL \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uace0\uae09 \ud569\uc131(HLS) \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uae30\ub2a5\uc801 \ucc38\uc870\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec LLM \uc0dd\uc131 HDL \uc124\uacc4\uc758 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \uc218\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c HDL \uc124\uacc4\uc758 \uae30\ub2a5\uc801 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "C/C++ \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc744 \uc785\ub825\uc73c\ub85c \ubc1b\uc544 LLM\uc774 HDL \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\uace0, Retrieval-Augmented Generation(RAG) \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uad6c\ubb38 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \uc218\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ub41c \ub3d9\uc791\uc744 \uace0\uae09 \ud569\uc131(HLS) \ucc38\uc870 \uc124\uacc4\uc640 \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uae30\ub2a5\uc801 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \ud68c\ub85c\ub294 \uae30\uc874 HLS \uc124\uacc4\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uba74\uc801\uacfc \uc804\ub825 \ud6a8\uc728\uc774 \uc720\uc758\ubbf8\ud558\uac8c \uac1c\uc120\ub418\uba70, \uc778\uac04\uc774 \uc124\uacc4\ud55c \ud68c\ub85c\uc758 \ud488\uc9c8\uc5d0 \uc811\uadfc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc0dd\uc131\ub41c HDL \uad6c\ud604\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba70 LLM\uc758 \uc0dd\uc131 \ub2a5\ub825\uacfc \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc815\ud655\uc131 \uc911\uc2ec IC \uc124\uacc4 \ud750\ub984\uc758 \uc5c4\uaca9\uc131\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uacfc \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uc124\uba85 \uc5b8\uc5b4(HDL)\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uc804\uba74 \uc124\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \ub180\ub77c\uc6b4 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub4e4\uc740 \ud658\uac01\uc744 \ud53c\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c HDL \uc124\uacc4\uc5d0 \uae30\ub2a5\uc801 \uc624\ub958\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 CorrectHDL\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uace0\uae09 \ud569\uc131(HLS) \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uae30\ub2a5\uc801 \ucc38\uc870\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec LLM\uc774 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c HDL \uc124\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801\uc778 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \uad50\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \uc785\ub825\uc740 \ub300\uc0c1 \ud68c\ub85c\uc758 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \uc9c0\uc815\ud55c C/C++ \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc740 LLM\uc5d0 \uc81c\uacf5\ub418\uc5b4 HDL \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \uc9c1\uc811 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uba70, \uad6c\ubb38 \uc624\ub958\ub294 Retrieval-Augmented Generation(RAG) \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc218\uc815\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.

In this paper, we argue that the path to trustworthy agentic workflows begins with solving the infrastructure problem first: traditional lakehouses are not suited for agent access patterns, but if we design one around transactions, governance follows. In particular, we draw an operational analogy to MVCC in databases and show why a direct transplant fails in a decoupled, multi-language setting.

Clinical notes, as unstructured documents rich with detailed patient observations, offer valuable context-specific insights and represent a promising yet underutilized source for ontology extension. Despite this potential, directly leveraging clinical notes for ontology extension remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we propose CLOZE, a novel framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to automatically extract medical entities from clinical notes and integrate them into hierarchical medical ontologies. By capitalizing on the strong language understanding and extensive biomedical knowledge of pre-trained LLMs, CLOZE effectively identifies disease-related concepts and captures complex hierarchical relationships. The zero-shot framework requires no additional training or labeled data, making it a cost-efficient solution. Furthermore, CLOZE ensures patient privacy through automated removal of protected health information (PHI).

While most existing datasets and benchmarks for training and evaluating GUI agents are static and idealized, failing to reflect the complexity and unpredictability of real-world environments, particularly the presence of anomalies. To bridge this research gap, we propose D-GARA, a dynamic benchmarking framework, to evaluate Android GUI agent robustness in real-world anomalies. D-GARA introduces a diverse set of real-world anomalies that GUI agents commonly face in practice, including interruptions such as permission dialogs, battery warnings, and update prompts. Based on D-GARA framework, we construct and annotate a benchmark featuring commonly used Android applications with embedded anomalies to support broader community research. Comprehensive experiments and results demonstrate substantial performance degradation in state-of-the-art GUI agents when exposed to anomaly-rich environments, highlighting the need for robustness-aware learning. D-GARA is modular and extensible, supporting the seamless integration of new tasks, anomaly types, and interaction scenarios to meet specific evaluation goals.", "AI": {"tldr": "D-GARA\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c GUI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uac15\uc778\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc778\uac04 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 GUI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \uc77c\ubc18 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\ud55c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc774\uc815\ud45c\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "D-GARA\ub294 Android GUI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc2e4\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud754\ud788 \uc9c1\uba74\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc2e4\uc138\uacc4 \uc774\uc0c1 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ucd5c\uc2e0 GUI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc774\uc0c1 \ud604\uc0c1\uc774 \ub9ce\uc740 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5 \uc800\ud558\uac00 \ud06c\uac8c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "D-GARA\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc791\uc5c5, \uc774\uc0c1 \uc720\ud615 \ubc0f \uc778\ud130\ub799\uc158 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc758 \ub9e4\ub044\ub7ec\uc6b4 \ud1b5\ud569\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc124\uacc4\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc778\uac04 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac16\ucd98 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uadf8\ub798\ud53d \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4(GUI)\ub97c \uc6b4\uc601\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc9c0\ub2a5\ud615 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \uc77c\ubc18 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\ud55c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc774\uc815\ud45c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 GUI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uad50\uc721 \ubc0f \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc640 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub294 \uc815\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc774\uc0c1\ud654\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc5b4, \uc2e4\uc81c \ud658\uacbd\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uacfc \uc608\uce21 \ubd88\uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubc18\uc601\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uc18c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c Android GUI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uac15\uc778\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub3d9\uc801 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 D-GARA\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

To address these limitations, we introduce Deliberate Practice Policy Optimization (DPPO), a metacognitive ``Metaloop'' training framework that dynamically alternates between supervised fine-tuning (competence expansion) and reinforcement learning (skill refinement). This enables automatic weakness identification and targeted resource allocation, specifically designed to maximize learning efficiency from sparse, finite data. Theoretically, DPPO can be formalised as a unified preference-learning framework. Empirically, training a vision-language embodied model with DPPO, referred to as Pelican-VL 1.0, yields a 20.3% performance improvement over the base model and surpasses open-source models at the 100B-parameter scale by 10.6%.

We synthesize cognitive science research into a taxonomy of 28 cognitive elements spanning computational constraints, meta-cognitive controls, knowledge representations, and transformation operations, then analyze their behavioral manifestations in reasoning traces. We propose a fine-grained cognitive evaluation framework and conduct the first large-scale analysis of 170K traces from 17 models across text, vision, and audio modalities, alongside 54 human think-aloud traces, which we make publicly available. Our analysis reveals systematic structural differences: humans employ hierarchical nesting and meta-cognitive monitoring while models rely on shallow forward chaining, with divergence most pronounced on ill-structured problems. Meta-analysis of 1,598 LLM reasoning papers reveals the research community concentrates on easily quantifiable behaviors (sequential organization: 55%, decomposition: 60%) while neglecting meta-cognitive controls (self-awareness: 16%, evaluation: 8%) that correlate with success. Models possess behavioral repertoires associated with success but fail to deploy them spontaneously. Leveraging these patterns, we develop test-time reasoning guidance that automatically scaffold successful structures, improving performance by up to 60% on complex problems. By bridging cognitive science and LLM research, we establish a foundation for developing models that reason through principled cognitive mechanisms rather than brittle spurious reasoning shortcuts or memorization, opening new directions for both improving model capabilities and testing theories of human cognition at scale.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740
