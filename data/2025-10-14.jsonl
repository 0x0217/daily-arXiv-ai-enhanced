While artificial intelligence (AI) offers promising\navenues for intervention, current applications are often siloed, addressing\nsingular aspects of the disease such as diagnostics or caregiver support\nwithout systemic integration. This paper proposes a novel methodological\nframework for a comprehensive, multi-agent system (MAS) designed for holistic\nAlzheimer's disease management. The objective is to detail the architecture of\na collaborative ecosystem of specialized AI agents, each engineered to address\na distinct challenge in the AD care continuum, from caregiver support and\nmultimodal data analysis to automated research and clinical data\ninterpretation. The proposed framework is composed of eight specialized,\ninteroperable agents. These agents are categorized by function: (1) Caregiver\nand Patient Support, (2) Data Analysis and Research, and (3) Advanced\nMultimodal Workflows. The methodology details the technical architecture of\neach agent, leveraging a suite of advanced technologies including large\nlanguage models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o and Gemini, multi-agent orchestration\nframeworks, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for evidence-grounded\nresponses, and specialized tools for web scraping, multimodal data processing,\nand in-memory database querying. This paper presents a detailed architectural\nblueprint for an integrated AI ecosystem for AD care. By moving beyond\nsingle-purpose tools to a collaborative, multi-agent paradigm, this framework\nestablishes a foundation for developing more adaptive, personalized, and\nproactive solutions. This methodological approach aims to pave the way for\nfuture systems capable of synthesizing diverse data streams to improve patient\noutcomes and reduce caregiver burden."}

To address this, we present a novel approach\ninspired by the fundamental principle of computer security: data should not\ncontain executable instructions. Instead of sample-level classification, we\npropose a token-level sanitization process, which surgically removes any\ninstructions directed at AI systems from tool outputs, capturing malicious\ninstructions as a byproduct.

While artificial intelligence (AI) offers promising\navenues for intervention, current applications are often siloed, addressing\nsingular aspects of the disease such as diagnostics or caregiver support\nwithout systemic integration. This paper proposes a novel methodological\nframework for a comprehensive, multi-agent system (MAS) designed for holistic\nAlzheimer's disease management. The objective is to detail the architecture of\na collaborative ecosystem of specialized AI agents, each engineered to address\na distinct challenge in the AD care continuum, from caregiver support and\nmultimodal data analysis to automated research and clinical data\ninterpretation. The proposed framework is composed of eight specialized,\ninteroperable agents. These agents are categorized by function: (1) Caregiver\nand Patient Support, (2) Data Analysis and Research, and (3) Advanced\nMultimodal Workflows. The methodology details the technical architecture of\neach agent, leveraging a suite of advanced technologies including large\nlanguage models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o and Gemini, multi-agent orchestration\nframeworks, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for evidence-grounded\nresponses, and specialized tools for web scraping, multimodal data processing,\nand in-memory database querying.

This methodological approach aims to pave the way for\nfuture systems capable of synthesizing diverse data streams to improve patient\noutcomes and reduce caregiver burden."}

We term this process hypothesis\nhunting: the cumulative search for insight through sustained exploration across\nvast and complex hypothesis spaces. To support it, we introduce AScience, a\nframework modeling discovery as the interaction of agents, networks, and\nevaluation norms, and implement it as ASCollab, a distributed system of\nLLM-based research agents with heterogeneous behaviors. These agents\nself-organize into evolving networks, continually producing and peer-reviewing\nfindings under shared standards of evaluation. Experiments show that such\nsocial dynamics enable the accumulation of expert-rated results along the\ndiversity-quality-novelty frontier, including rediscoveries of established\nbiomarkers, extensions of known pathways, and proposals of new therapeutic\ntargets. While wet-lab validation remains indispensable, our experiments on\ncancer cohorts demonstrate that socially structured, agentic networks can\nsustain exploratory hypothesis hunting at scale."}

Traditional centralized algorithms that have global\ninformation, such as Conflict-Based Search (CBS), provide high-quality\nsolutions but become computationally expensive in large-scale scenarios due to\nthe combinatorial explosion of conflicts that need resolution. Conversely,\ndistributed approaches that have local information, particularly learning-based\nmethods, offer better scalability by operating with relaxed information\navailability, yet often at the cost of solution quality. To address these\nlimitations, we propose a hybrid framework that combines decentralized path\nplanning with a lightweight centralized coordinator. Our framework leverages\nreinforcement learning (RL) for decentralized planning, enabling agents to\nadapt their planning based on minimal, targeted alerts--such as static\nconflict-cell flags or brief conflict tracks--that are dynamically shared\ninformation from the central coordinator for effective conflict resolution. We\nempirically study the effect of the information available to an agent on its\nplanning performance. Our approach reduces the inter-agent information sharing\ncompared to fully centralized and distributed methods, while still consistently\nfinding feasible, collision-free solutions--even in large-scale scenarios\nhaving higher agent counts."}

Due to the context-dependent nature of attacks, however, current\ndefenses are often ill-calibrated as they cannot reliably differentiate\nmalicious and benign instructions, leading to high false positive rates that\nprevent their real-world adoption. To address this, we present a novel approach\ninspired by the fundamental principle of computer security: data should not\ncontain executable instructions. Instead of sample-level classification, we\npropose a token-level sanitization process, which surgically removes any\ninstructions directed at AI systems from tool outputs, capturing malicious\ninstructions as a byproduct. In contrast to existing safety classifiers, this\napproach is non-blocking, does not require calibration, and is agnostic to the\ncontext of tool outputs. Further, we can train such token-level predictors with\nreadily available instruction-tuning data only, and don't have to rely on\nunrealistic prompt injection examples from challenges or of other synthetic\norigin. In our experiments, we find that this approach generalizes well across\na wide range of attacks and benchmarks like AgentDojo, BIPIA, InjecAgent, ASB\nand SEP, achieving a 7-10x reduction of attack success rate (ASR) (34% to 3% on\nAgentDojo), without impairing agent utility in both benign and malicious\nsettings."}

Prior GUI agents compress\npast trajectories into text tokens, which balloons context length and misses\ndecisive visual cues (e.g., exact widget size and position). We propose a\ncontinuous memory that encodes each GUI trajectory into a fixed-length sequence\nof continuous embeddings using the VLM itself as an encoder; these embeddings\nare plugged directly into the backbone's input layer, sharply reducing context\ncost while preserving fine-grained visual information. As memory size and\nretrieval depth increase, performance improves monotonically, unlike text\nmemories that degrade with long prompts. To grow memory at low cost, we\nintroduce an auto-scaling data flywheel that (i) discovers new environments via\nsearch, (ii) synthesizes tasks with an open-source VLM, (iii) rolls out\ntrajectories with the agent, and (iv) verifies success with the same VLM. Using\nthis pipeline, we collect 100k+ trajectories for about \\$4000 and fine-tune\nonly the memory encoder (LoRA on a Q-Former, 1.2\\% parameters) with 1,500\nsamples.
