To address this, reusing historical Key-Value (KV) Cache for\nimproved inference efficiency has become a mainstream approach. Recent advances\nfurther enhance throughput by sparse attention mechanisms to select the most\nrelevant KV Cache, thereby reducing sequence length. However, such techniques\nare limited to single-context scenarios, where historical KV Cache is computed\nsequentially with causal-attention dependencies. In retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) scenarios, where retrieved documents as context are unknown\nbeforehand, each document's KV Cache is computed and stored independently\n(termed multiple-context KV Cache), lacking cross-attention between contexts.\nThis renders existing methods ineffective. Although prior work partially\nrecomputes multiple-context KV Cache to mitigate accuracy loss from missing\ncross-attention, it requires retaining all KV Cache throughout, failing to\nreduce memory overhead. This paper presents SamKV, the first exploration of\nattention sparsification for multiple-context KV Cache. Specifically, SamKV\ntakes into account the complementary information of other contexts when\nsparsifying one context, and then locally recomputes the sparsified\ninformation. Experiments demonstrate that our method compresses sequence length\nto 15% without accuracy degradation compared with full-recompuation baselines,\nsignificantly boosting throughput in multi-context

Static analysis tools based on rule-based patterns\nusually do not work well at detecting the context-dependent bugs and lead to\nhigh false positive rates. Recent developments in artificial intelligence,\nspecifically the use of transformer-based models like CodeBERT and CodeLlama,\nprovide light to this problem, as they show potential in finding such flaws\nbetter. This paper presents the implementations of these models on various\ndatasets of code vulnerability, showing how off-the-shelf models can\nsuccessfully produce predictive capacity in models through dynamic fine-tuning\nof the models on vulnerable and safe code fragments. The methodology comprises\nthe gathering of the dataset, normalization of the language, fine-tuning of the\nmodel, and incorporation of ensemble learning and explainable AI. Experiments\nshow that a well-trained CodeBERT can be as good as or even better than some\nexisting static analyzers in terms of accuracy greater than 97%. Further study\nhas indicated that although language models can achieve close-to-perfect\nrecall, the precision can decrease. A solution to this is given by hybrid\nmodels and validation procedures, which will reduce false positives. According\nto the results, the AI-based solutions generalize to different programming\nlanguages and classes of vulnerability.

We introduce Representation Stability (RS), a model-agnostic\ndetection framework that identifies adversarial examples by measuring how\nembedding representations change when important words are masked. RS first\nranks words using importance heuristics, then measures embedding sensitivity to\nmasking top-k critical words, and processes the resulting patterns with a\nBiLSTM detector. Experiments show that adversarially perturbed words exhibit\ndisproportionately high masking sensitivity compared to naturally important\nwords. Across three datasets, three attack types, and two victim models, RS\nachieves over 88% detection accuracy and demonstrates competitive performance\ncompared to existing state-of-the-art methods, often at lower computational\ncost. Using Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) to measure\nperturbation identification quality, we reveal that gradient-based ranking\noutperforms attention and random selection approaches, with identification\nquality correlating with detection performance for word-level attacks. RS also\ngeneralizes well to unseen datasets, attacks, and models without retraining,\nproviding a practical solution for adversarial text detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\ub9bd\uc801 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Representation Stability(RS)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud2b8\ub79c\uc2a4\ud3ec\uba38 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub300\ub9bd\uc801 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uacf5\uaca9\uc740 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uc704\ud611\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\uc5b4\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uacf5\uaca9 \ud2b9\uc815\uc801\uc774\uac70\ub098 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4dc\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc7ac\ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "RS\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uad6c\uc560\ubc1b\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub2e8\uc5b4\uac00 \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud0b9\ub420 \ub54c \uc784\ubca0\ub529 \ud45c\ud604\uc758 \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \uce21\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \ub300\ub9bd\uc801 \uc0ac\ub840\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud55c\ub2e4. \uba3c\uc800 \uc911\uc694\uc131 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e8\uc5b4\ub97c \uc21c\uc704 \ub9e4\uae30\uace0, \uc0c1\uc704 k\uac1c\uc758 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub2e8\uc5b4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud0b9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc784\ubca0\ub529 \ubbfc\uac10\ub3c4\ub97c \uce21\uc815\ud55c \ud6c4, BiLSTM \ud0d0\uc9c0\uae30\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uacb0\uacfc \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud5d8\ub2c8 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \ub300\ub9bd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc12d\ub3d9\ub41c \ub2e8\uc5b4\ub294 \uc790\uc5f0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub2e8\uc5b4\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 disproportionately \ub192\uc740 \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud0b9 \ubbfc\uac10\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4. \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b, \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc720\ud615, \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \ud53c\ud574 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c RS\ub294 88% \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uc885\uc885 \ub354 \ub0ae\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "RS\ub294 \uc7ac\ud6c8\ub828 \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 \ubcf4\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b, \uacf5\uaca9, \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uc798 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ub300\ub9bd\uc801 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\uc81c\uc801\uc778 \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ub9bd\uc801 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uacf5\uaca9\uc740 \ud2b8\ub79c\uc2a4\ud3ec\uba38 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uc704\ud611\uc744 \uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubc29\uc5b4\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uacf5\uaca9 \ud2b9\uc815\uc801\uc774\uac70\ub098 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4dc\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc7ac\ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub2e8\uc5b4\uac00 \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud0b9\ub420 \ub54c \uc784\ubca0\ub529 \ud45c\ud604\uc774 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ubcc0\ud654\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uce21\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \ub300\ub9bd\uc801 \uc0ac\ub840\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378 \ube44\uc758\uc874\uc801 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Representation Stability(RS)\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.

Malicious GraphQL queries can exploit the\nlanguage's dynamic nature, leading to denial-of-service attacks, data\nexfiltration through injection, and other exploits. Existing solutions, such as\nstatic analysis, rate limiting, and general-purpose Web Application Firewalls,\noffer limited protection against sophisticated, context-aware attacks. This\npaper presents a novel, AI-driven approach for real-time detection of malicious\nGraphQL queries. Our method combines static analysis with machine learning\ntechniques, including Large Language Models (LLMs) for dynamic schema-based\nconfiguration, Sentence Transformers (SBERT and Doc2Vec) for contextual\nembedding of query payloads, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Random\nForests, and Multilayer Perceptrons for classification.

Numerous deep\nlearning models have developed to reconstruct ABP waveform from noninvasively\nacquired physiological signals such as electrocardiogram and\nphotoplethysmogram. However, limited research has addressed the issue of model\nperformance and computational load for deployment on embedded systems. The\nstudy introduces a lightweight sInvResUNet, along with a collaborative learning\nscheme named KDCL_sInvResUNet. With only 0.89 million parameters and a\ncomputational load of 0.02 GFLOPS, real-time ABP estimation was successfully\nachieved on embedded devices with an inference time of just 8.49 milliseconds\nfor a 10-second output. We performed subject-independent validation in a\nlarge-scale and heterogeneous perioperative dataset containing 1,257,141 data\nsegments from 2,154 patients, with a wide BP range (41-257 mmHg for SBP, and\n31-234 mmHg for DBP). The proposed KDCL_sInvResUNet achieved lightly better\nperformance compared to large models, with a mean absolute error of 10.06 mmHg\nand mean Pearson correlation of 0.88 in tracking ABP changes. Despite these\npromising results, all deep learning models showed significant performance\nvariations across different demographic and cardiovascular conditions,\nhighlighting their limited ability to generalize across such a broad and\ndiverse population.

A popular scenario for it consists of\nsubmitting a picture of the user's Identity Document (ID) to a service\nplatform, authenticating its veracity, and then granting access to the\nrequested digital service. An ID is well-suited to verify the identity of an\nindividual, since it is government issued, unique, and nontransferable.\nHowever, with recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), attackers can\nsurpass security measures in IDs and create very realistic physical and\nsynthetic fake IDs. Researchers are now trying to develop methods to detect an\never-growing number of these AI-based fakes that are almost indistinguishable\nfrom authentic (bona fide) IDs. In this counterattack effort, researchers are\nfaced with an important challenge: the difficulty in using real data to train\nfake ID detectors. This real data scarcity for research and development is\noriginated by the sensitive nature of these documents, which are usually kept\nprivate by the ID owners (the users) and the ID Holders (e.g., government,\npolice, bank, etc.). The main contributions of our study are: 1) We propose and\ndiscuss a patch-based methodology to preserve privacy in fake ID detection\nresearch. 2) We provide a new public database, FakeIDet2-db, comprising over\n900K real/fake ID patches extracted from 2,000 ID images, acquired using\ndifferent smartphone sensors, illumination and height conditions, etc. In\naddition, three physical attacks are considered: print, screen, and composite.\n3) We present a new privacy-aware fake ID detection method, FakeIDet2. 4) We\nrelease a standard reproducible benchmark that considers physical and synthetic\nattacks from popular databases in the literature.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc6d0\uaca9 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uac80\uc99d\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc774 \ucee4\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, ID \ubb38\uc11c\uc758 \uc9c4\uc704 \ud655\uc778\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc811\uadfc\uc744 \ud5c8\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc81c\uc548\ub41c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 AI\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 ID\uac00 \uc544\ub2cc \uace0\uae09\uc758 \uac00\uc9dc ID\uac00 \ub4f1\uc7a5\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc5b4, \uc774\ub4e4\uc744 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uac00\uc9dc ID \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uacfc \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ubca0\uc774\uc2a4\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc6d0\uaca9 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uac80\uc99d\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc774 \ucee4\uc9c0\uba74\uc11c, AI \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uace0\uae09 \uac00\uc9dc ID \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc874\ud558\ub294 \ud328\uce58 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, 900K \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uc2e4\ubb3c/\uac00\uc9dc ID \ud328\uce58\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacf5\uac1c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ubca0\uc774\uc2a4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc \uc778\uc2dd \uac00\uc9dc ID \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ubc1c\ud45c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "FakeIDet2-db \ub370\uc774\ud130\ubca0\uc774\uc2a4\ub294 2,000\uac1c\uc758 ID \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd94\ucd9c\ub41c \ud328\uce58\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9 3\uac00\uc9c0 \uc720\ud615(\uc778\uc1c4, \ud654\uba74, \ud569\uc131)\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ud45c\uc900 \uc7ac\ud604 \uac00\ub2a5 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \ubc1c\ud45c\ud558\uc5ec \ubb38\ud5cc\uc758 \uc778\uae30 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ubca0\uc774\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \ubc0f \ud569\uc131 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc778\ud130\ub137 \uae30\ubc18 \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6d0\uaca9 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uac80\uc99d\uc774 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uc911\uc694\ud574\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uc640 \uad00\ub828\ub41c \uc778\uae30 \uc788\ub294 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc758 \uc2e0\uc6d0 \ubb38\uc11c(ID) \uc0ac\uc9c4\uc744 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc5d0 \uc81c\ucd9c\ud558\uace0, \uadf8 \uc9c4\uc704\ub97c \uc778\uc99d\ud55c \ud6c4 \uc694\uccad\ub41c \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc811\uadfc\uc744 \ud5c8\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Existing incremental learning methods focus on task expansion within a\nsingle modality, whereas MBIIL seeks to train a unified model incrementally\nacross modalities. The MBIIL faces two challenges: I) How to preserve\npreviously learned knowledge during incremental updates? II) How to effectively\nleverage knowledge acquired from existing modalities to support new modalities?\nTo address these challenges, we propose MSLoRA-CR, a method that fine-tunes\nModality-Specific LoRA modules while incorporating Contrastive Regularization\nto enhance intra-modality knowledge sharing and promote inter-modality\nknowledge differentiation. Our approach builds upon a large vision-language\nmodel (LVLM), keeping the pretrained model frozen while incrementally adapting\nnew LoRA modules for each modality or task. Experiments on the incremental\nlearning of biomedical images demonstrate that MSLoRA-CR outperforms both the\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) approach of training separate models for each modality\nand the general incremental learning method (incrementally fine-tuning LoRA).\nSpecifically, MSLoRA-CR achieves a 1.88% improvement in overall performance\ncompared to unconstrained incremental learning methods while maintaining\ncomputational efficiency.

We\nframe privacy as membership inference at the traffic-source level--a realistic\nand actionable threat for data holders. To this end, we present TraceBleed, the\nfirst attack that exploits behavioral fingerprints across flows using\ncontrastive learning and temporal chunking, outperforming prior membership\ninference baselines by 172%. Our large-scale study across GAN-, diffusion-, and\nGPT-based SynNetGens uncovers critical insights: (i) SynNetGens leak user-level\ninformation; (ii) differential privacy either fails to stop these attacks or\nseverely degrades fidelity; and (iii) sharing more synthetic data amplifies\nleakage by 59% on average.

However, decentralized policies\noperate under partial observability and often yield suboptimal performance\ncompared to centralized policies, while fully centralized approaches typically\nface scalability challenges as the number of agents increases.\n  We propose Centralized Permutation Equivariant (CPE) learning, a centralized\ntraining and execution framework that employs a fully centralized policy to\novercome these limitations. Our approach leverages a novel permutation\nequivariant architecture, Global-Local Permutation Equivariant (GLPE) networks,\nthat is lightweight, scalable, and easy to implement.

However, most neural solvers are trained to tackle VRP instances in a\nrelatively monotonous context, e.g., simplifying VRPs by using Euclidean\ndistance between nodes and adhering to a single problem size, which harms their\noff-the-shelf application in different scenarios. To enhance their versatility,\nthis paper presents a novel lifelong learning framework that incrementally\ntrains a neural solver to manage VRPs in distinct contexts. Specifically, we\npropose a lifelong learner (LL), exploiting a Transformer network as the\nbackbone, to solve a series of VRPs. The inter-context self-attention mechanism\nis proposed within LL to transfer the knowledge obtained from solving preceding\nVRPs into the succeeding ones. On top of that, we develop a dynamic context\nscheduler (DCS), employing the cross-context experience replay to further\nfacilitate LL looking back on the attained policies of solving preceding VRPs.\nExtensive results on synthetic and benchmark instances (problem sizes up to\n18k) show that our LL is capable of discovering effective policies for tackling\ngeneric VRPs in varying contexts, which outperforms other neural solvers and\nachieves the best performance for most VRPs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ucc28\ub7c9 \uacbd\ub85c \ubb38\uc81c(VRPs)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e0\uacbd \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc758 \uc751\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0b6\uc758 \uc8fc\uae30 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0\uc11c VRPs\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad00\ub9ac\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc2e0\uacbd \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc744 \uc810\uc9c4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc2e0\uacbd \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc740 \uc0c1\ub300\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e8\uc870\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0\uc11c VRP \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud6c8\ub828\ub418\uc5b4 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc751\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 Transformer \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ubc31\ubcf8\uc73c\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc77c\ub828\uc758 VRPs\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ud3c9\uc0dd \ud559\uc2b5\uc790(LL)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, LL \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ub9e5\ub77d \uac04 \uc790\uae30 \uc8fc\uc758 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\uc804 VRP \ud574\uacb0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5bb\uc740 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ub2e4\uc74c \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc804\uc774\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud569\uc131 \ubc0f \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \uc0ac\ub840(\ubb38\uc81c \ud06c\uae30 \ucd5c\ub300 18k)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 LL\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\ubc18 VRPs\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc774 \uc785\uc99d\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \ub2e4\ub978 \uc2e0\uacbd \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ucc28\ub7c9 \uacbd\ub85c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e0\uacbd \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc758 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\ub294 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd\uc740 \ucc28\ub7c9 \uacbd\ub85c \ubb38\uc81c(VRPs)\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud558\uac8c \ud0d0\uad6c\ub418\uc5b4 \uc654\uc73c\uba70, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc2e0\uacbd \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \uc2e0\uacbd \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc740 \uc0c1\ub300\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e8\uc870\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0\uc11c VRP \uc0ac\ub840\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud6c8\ub828\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ub178\ub4dc \uac04 \uc720\ud074\ub9ac\ub4dc \uac70\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\uacfc \ub2e8\uc77c \ubb38\uc81c \ud06c\uae30\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc989\uac01\uc801\uc778 \uc751\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud574\uce58\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc758 \ub2e4\uc7ac\ub2e4\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0\uc11c VRPs\ub97c \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc2e0\uacbd \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc744 \uc810\uc9c4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud3c9\uc0dd \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Transformer \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uc0dd \ud559\uc2b5\uc790(LL)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc77c\ub828\uc758 VRPs\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud55c\ub2e4.

To this end, we present SafeSieve, a progressive and adaptive\nmulti-agent pruning algorithm that dynamically refines the inter-agent\ncommunication through a novel dual-mechanism. SafeSieve integrates initial\nLLM-based semantic evaluation with accumulated performance feedback, enabling a\nsmooth transition from heuristic initialization to experience-driven\nrefinement. Unlike existing greedy Top-k pruning methods, SafeSieve employs\n0-extension clustering to preserve structurally coherent agent groups while\neliminating ineffective links. Experiments across benchmarks (SVAMP, HumanEval,\netc.) showcase that SafeSieve achieves 94.01% average accuracy while reducing\ntoken usage by 12.4%-27.8%.

An effective approach\nfor practically solving integer programs is the manual design of acceleration\ncuts, i.e. inequalities that improve solver performance. However, this creative\nprocess demands deep expertise and is yet to be automated. Our proposed\nframework, EvoCut, automates the generation of acceleration cuts by combining\nlarge language models (LLMs) with an evolutionary search. EvoCut (i)\ninitializes a diverse population of candidate cuts via an LLM-based initializer\nagent; (ii) for each cut empirically evaluates both preservation of the optimal\nsolution and its ability to cut off fractional solutions across a verification\nset; and (iii) iteratively refines the population through evolutionary\ncrossover and mutation agents. We quantify each cut's utility by its relative\nreduction in the solver's optimality gap. Our comparisons against standard\ninteger programming practice show that EvoCut reduces optimality gap by 17-57%\nwithin a fixed time. It obtains the same solutions up to 4 times as fast, and\nobtains higher-quality solutions within the same time limit. Requiring no human\nexpert input, EvoCut reliably generates, improves, and empirically verifies\ncuts that generalize to unseen instances.

Accurate demographic forecasting is essential for\ninformed decision-making in areas such as urban planning, healthcare, and\neconomic policy. This study explores the application of time series foundation\nmodels to predict demographic changes in the United States using datasets from\nthe U.S. Census Bureau and Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED). We evaluate\nthe performance of the Time Series Foundation Model (TimesFM) against\ntraditional baselines including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks,\nAutoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), and Linear Regression. Our\nexperiments across six demographically diverse states demonstrate that TimesFM\nachieves the lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE) in 86.67% of test cases, with\nparticularly strong performance on minority populations with sparse historical\ndata.

A requirement\nfor shared computing environments is a centralized identity system to\nauthenticate and authorize user access. An organization's digital identity\nplane is a prime target for cyber threat actors. When compromised, identities\ncan be exploited to steal credentials, create unauthorized accounts, and\nmanipulate permissions-enabling attackers to gain control of the network and\nundermine its confidentiality, availability, and integrity. Cybercrime losses\nreached a record of 16.6 B in the United States in 2024. For organizations\nusing Microsoft software, Active Directory is the on-premises identity system\nof choice. In this article, we examine the challenge of security compromises in\nActive Directory (AD) environments and present effective strategies to prevent\ncredential theft and limit lateral movement by threat actors. Our proposed\napproaches aim to confine the movement of compromised credentials, preventing\nsignificant privilege escalation and theft. We argue that through our\nillustration of real-world scenarios, tiering can halt lateral movement and\nadvanced cyber-attacks, thus reducing ransom escalation. Our work bridges a gap\nin existing literature by combining technical guidelines with theoretical\narguments in support of tiering, positioning it as a vital component of modern\ncybersecurity strategy even though it cannot function in isolation. As the\nhardware advances and the cloud sourced services along with AI is advancing\nwith unprecedented speed, we think it is important for security experts and the\nbusiness to work together and start designing and developing software and\nframeworks to classify devices automatically and accurately within the tiered\nstructure.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 Active Directory

We rigorously evaluate LARC on a\ncarefully curated set of 48 constrained retrosynthesis planning tasks across 3\nconstraint types.

Traditional site planning often relies on experiential judgment\nand single-source data, limiting systematic quantification of multifunctional\nlayouts. We propose a Site Planning Layout Indicator (SPLI) system, a\ndata-driven framework integrating empirical knowledge with heterogeneous\nmulti-source data to produce structured urban spatial information. The SPLI\nsupports multimodal spatial data systems for analytics, inference, and\nretrieval by combining OpenStreetMap (OSM), Points of Interest (POI), building\nmorphology, land use, and satellite imagery.

We use\nthe public ASCAD `fixed' and `variable' key dataset, containing 700 and 1400 EM\ntraces respectively from an AES-128 implementation on an 8-bit microcontroller.\nThe problem is framed as a 256-class classification task where we target the\noutput of the first-round S-box operation, which is dependent on a single key\nbyte. We evaluate standard classifiers (Random Forest (RF), Support Vector\nMachine (SVM)), a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) and a Residual Neural\nNetwork(ResNet). We also explore the utility of RF-based feature importance for\ndimensionality reduction. Crucially, we employ this domain-specific Key Rank\nmetric for evaluation, showing its necessity over standard classification\naccuracy. Our results show that SVM and RF on full features perform poorly in\nkey ranking. However, RF trained on reduced (top 100) identified via importance\nanalysis achieves Rank 0 (successful key byte recovery) using almost half the\nattack traces. The implemented CNN also achieves Rank 0 efficiently using\napproximately 65 attack traces for the fixed-key dataset. The ResNets perform\nbest on large and complex datasets but may not always be the best choice for\nsimple fixed key dataset in terms of efficiency.

By representing AI agents as coupled oscillators with both phase and\namplitude dynamics, our model captures essential aspects of agent\nspecialization, influence, and communication within networked systems. We\nintroduce an order parameter to quantify the degree of coordination and\nsynchronization, providing insights into how coupling strength, agent\ndiversity, and network topology impact emergent collective behavior.\nFurthermore, we formalize a detailed correspondence between Chain-of-Thought\nprompting in AI reasoning and synchronization phenomena, unifying human-like\niterative problem solving with emergent group intelligence. Through extensive\nsimulations on all-to-all and deterministic scale-free networks, we demonstrate\nthat increased coupling promotes robust synchronization despite heterogeneous\nagent capabilities, reflecting realistic collaborative AI scenarios.

While\nexisting methods primarily focus on uncovering causal structures among observed\nsubprocesses, real-world systems are often only partially observed, with latent\nsubprocesses posing significant challenges. In this paper, we show that\ncontinuous-time event sequences can be represented by a discrete-time model as\nthe time interval shrinks, and we leverage this insight to establish necessary\nand sufficient conditions for identifying latent subprocesses and the causal\ninfluences. Accordingly, we propose a two-phase iterative algorithm that\nalternates between inferring causal relationships among discovered subprocesses\nand uncovering new latent subprocesses, guided by path-based conditions that\nguarantee identifiability. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world\ndatasets show that our method effectively recovers causal structures despite\nthe presence of latent subprocesses.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub2e4\ubcc0\ub7c9 \ud638\ud06c \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\uac04 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uacfc \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8 \uc8fc\ub3c4 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uad00\ucc30\ub41c \ud558\uc704 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \uac04\uc758 \uc778\uacfc \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc810\uc744 \ub450\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\ub098, \uc2e4\uc81c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \ubd80\ubd84\uc801\uc73c\ub85c\ub9cc \uad00\ucc30\ub418\uba70, \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \ud558\uc704 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\uac00 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804\uc744 \uc81c\uae30\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2e4\uc81c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uad00\ucc30\uc774 \ubd88\uc644\uc804\ud558\uace0 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \ud558\uc704 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\uac00 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud568.", "method": "\uc2dc\uac04 \uac04\uaca9\uc774 \uc904\uc5b4\ub4e4\uba74\uc11c \uc5f0\uc18d \uc2dc\uac04 \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\ub97c \uc774\uc0b0 \uc2dc\uac04 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c \ud45c\ud604\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \ud558\uc704 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\uc640 \uc778\uacfc\uc801 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc870\uac74\uacfc \ucda9\ubd84\ud55c \uc870\uac74\uc744 \uc218\ub9bd\ud558\ub294 \ub450 \ub2e8\uacc4 \ubc18\ubcf5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud568.", "result": "\ud569\uc131 \ubc0f \uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \ud558\uc704 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \uc778\uacfc \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf5\uad6c\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90c.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \ud558\uc704 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub2e4\ubcc0\ub7c9 \ud638\ud06c \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\uac04 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uacfc \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8 \uc8fc\ub3c4 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uad00\ucc30\ub41c \ud558\uc704 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \uac04\uc758 \uc778\uacfc \uad6c\uc870\ub97c uncover \ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc8fc\ub85c \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc2e4\uc81c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \ubd80\ubd84\uc801\uc73c\ub85c\ub9cc \uad00\ucc30\ub418\uba70 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \ud558\uc704 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub294 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804\uc744 \uc81c\uae30\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5f0\uc18d \uc2dc\uac04 \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\uac00 \uc2dc\uac04 \uac04\uaca9\uc774 \uc904\uc5b4\ub4e4 \ub54c \uc774\uc0b0 \uc2dc\uac04 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c \ud45c\ud604\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uace0, \uc774 \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \ud558\uc704 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \ubc0f \uc778\uacfc\uc801 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud544\uc694 \uc870\uac74 \ubc0f \ucda9\ubd84 \uc870\uac74\uc744 \uc218\ub9bd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubc1c\uacac\ub41c \ud558\uc704 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \uac04 \uc778\uacfc \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ucd94\ub860\ud558\uace0 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \ud558\uc704 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c uncover \ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubc18\ubcf5\ud558\ub294 \ub450 \ub2e8\uacc4 \ubc18\ubcf5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc2dd\ubcc4 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ub85c \uae30\ubc18 \uc870\uac74\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc548\ub0b4\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud569\uc131 \ubc0f \uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \ud558\uc704 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\uc758 \uc874\uc7ac\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \uc778\uacfc \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf5\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

These hierarchies can\nsimplify coordination, but they also can introduce trade-offs that are not\nalways obvious. This paper proposes a multi-dimensional taxonomy for HMAS along\nfive axes: control hierarchy, information flow, role and task delegation,\ntemporal layering, and communication structure. The intent is not to prescribe\na single \"best\" design but to provide a lens for comparing different\napproaches.\n  Rather than treating these dimensions in isolation, the taxonomy is connected\nto concrete coordination mechanisms - from the long-standing contract-net\nprotocol for task allocation to more recent work in hierarchical reinforcement\nlearning. Industrial contexts illustrate the framework, including power grids\nand oilfield operations, where agents at production, maintenance, and supply\nlevels coordinate to diagnose well issues or balance energy demand. These cases\nsuggest that hierarchical structures may achieve global efficiency while\npreserving local autonomy, though the balance is delicate.\n  The paper closes by identifying open challenges: making hierarchical\ndecisions explainable to human operators, scaling to very large agent\npopulations, and assessing whether learning-based agents such as large language\nmodels can be safely integrated into layered frameworks.

While most existing\nstudies rely on utility performance metrics, which are not robust enough due to\nvariations in opponent behavior and game structure. To address this limitation,\nwe propose \\textbf{Cognitive Hierarchy Benchmark (CHBench)}, a novel evaluation\nframework inspired by the cognitive hierarchy models from behavioral economics.\nWe hypothesize that agents have bounded rationality -- different agents behave\nat varying reasoning depths/levels. We evaluate LLMs' strategic reasoning\nthrough a three-phase systematic framework, utilizing behavioral data from six\nstate-of-the-art LLMs across fifteen carefully selected normal-form games.\nExperiments show that LLMs exhibit consistent strategic reasoning levels across\ndiverse opponents, confirming the framework's robustness and generalization\ncapability. We also analyze the effects of two key mechanisms (Chat Mechanism\nand Memory Mechanism) on strategic reasoning performance.

Specifically, we first\nextracted 4 types of fMRI temporal representations, i.e., time series (TCs),\nstatic/dynamic functional connection (FNC/dFNC), and multi-scale dispersion\nentropy (MsDE), to construct four encoders. Within each encoder, we employed a\nmodified Q-learning to dynamically optimize the NCS to extract high-level\nfeature vectors, where the NCS is formulated as a Markov Decision Process.\nThen, all feature vectors were fused via a Transformer, leveraging both\nstable/time-varying connections and multi-scale dependencies across different\nbrain regions to achieve the final classification. Additionally, an attention\nmodule was embedded to improve interpretability. The classification performance\nof our proposed BRIEF was compared with 21 state-of-the-art models by\ndiscriminating two mental disorders from healthy controls: schizophrenia (SZ,\nn=1100) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD, n=1550).

To\naddress these limitations, we propose \\textbf{AgentCDM}, a structured framework\nfor enhancing collaborative decision-making in LLM-based multi-agent systems.\nDrawing inspiration from the Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH) in\ncognitive science, AgentCDM introduces a structured reasoning paradigm that\nsystematically mitigates cognitive biases and shifts decision-making from\npassive answer selection to active hypothesis evaluation and construction. To\ninternalize this reasoning process, we develop a two-stage training paradigm:\nthe first stage uses explicit ACH-inspired scaffolding to guide the model\nthrough structured reasoning, while the second stage progressively removes this\nscaffolding to encourage autonomous generalization. Experiments on multiple\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate that AgentCDM achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance and exhibits strong generalization, validating its effectiveness in\nimproving the quality and robustness of collaborative decisions in MAS.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18 \ub2e4\uc218\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud611\ub825\uc801 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 AgentCDM\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud611\ub825\uc801 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815(CDM)\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec \uacfc\uc815\uc774 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \ud0d0\uad6c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uc73c\uba70, \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc778\uc9c0 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc9d1\ub2e8 \uc9c0\uc131\uc744 \uc644\uc804\ud788 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\uc810\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "AgentCDM\uc740 \uc778\uc9c0 \uacfc\ud559\uc758 \uacbd\uc7c1 \uac00\uc124 \ubd84\uc11d(ACH)\uc5d0\uc11c \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc544, \uc778\uc9c0 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc644\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc218\ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \ub2f5\ubcc0 \uc120\ud0dd\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \uac00\uc124 \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc0f \uad6c\ucd95\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\ud658\ud558\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \ub450 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc758 \ud6c8\ub828 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc548\ub0b4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c ACH \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801 \uad6c\uc870\ubb3c \uc2a4\uce90\ud3f4\ub529\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uba70, \ub450 \ubc88\uc9f8 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774 \uc2a4\uce90\ud3f4\ub529\uc744 \uc810\uc9c4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uac70\ud558\uc5ec \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \uc720\ub3c4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc5ec\ub7ec \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, AgentCDM\uc740 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\uc5b4 MAS\uc5d0\uc11c \ud611\ub825\uc801 \uacb0\uc815\uc758 \uc9c8\uacfc \uacac\uace0\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc784\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "AgentCDM\uc740 MLL \uae30\ubc18 \ub2e4\uc218\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud611\ub825\uc801 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \ub2e4\uc218 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(MAS)\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc720\ub9dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ub0b4 \ud611\ub825\uc801 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815(CDM)\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec \uacfc\uc815\uc740 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \ud0d0\uad6c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc778\uc9c0 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud55c '\ub3c5\uc7ac\uc801' \uc804\ub7b5\uc774\ub098 \uc9d1\ub2e8 \uc9c0\uc131\uc744 \uc644\uc804\ud788 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 '\ud22c\ud45c \uae30\ubc18' \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ub2e4\uc218 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud611\ub825\uc801 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 AgentCDM\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Our\napproach parametrizes the loss by modeling effective data transferred and\nleveraging scaling laws for fine-tuning. By experimenting with various\nsmall-scale data mixtures, we fit these parameters and derive the optimal\nweights. We provide both mathematical proofs and empirical results\ndemonstrating that our algorithm achieves excellent overall and individual\nperformance across all domains. Through controlled experiments, we show that\nmodels trained with our optimized weights perform on par with those using\noptimal weights determined via grid search, with per-domain loss only 0.66%\nhigher than the best domain loss from grid search on average.

To address this, we introduce CodeTracer, an innovative adaptive\ncode watermarking framework underpinned by a novel reinforcement learning\ntraining paradigm. At its core, CodeTracer features a policy-driven approach\nthat utilizes a parameterized model to intelligently bias token choices during\nnext-token prediction. This strategy ensures that embedded watermarks maintain\ncode functionality while exhibiting subtle yet statistically detectable\ndeviations from typical token distributions. To facilitate policy learning, we\ndevise a comprehensive reward system that seamlessly integrates execution\nfeedback with watermark embedding signals, balancing process-level and\noutcome-level rewards.

It underlies a variety of real-world tasks, including multi-robot\ncoordination, robot-assisted logistics, and social navigation. Recent\ndecentralized learnable solvers have shown great promise for large-scale MAPF,\nespecially when leveraging foundation models and large datasets. However, these\nagents are reactive policy models and exhibit limited modeling of environmental\ntemporal dynamics and inter-agent dependencies, resulting in performance\ndegradation in complex, long-term planning scenarios. To address these\nlimitations, we propose MAPF-World, an autoregressive action world model for\nMAPF that unifies situation understanding and action generation, guiding\ndecisions beyond immediate local observations. It improves situational\nawareness by explicitly modeling environmental dynamics, including spatial\nfeatures and temporal dependencies, through future state and actions\nprediction. By incorporating these predicted futures, MAPF-World enables more\ninformed, coordinated, and far-sighted decision-making, especially in complex\nmulti-agent settings. Furthermore, we augment MAPF benchmarks by introducing an\nautomatic map generator grounded in real-world scenarios, capturing practical\nmap layouts for training and evaluating MAPF solvers.

While recent advances in\nTime Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have demonstrated strong generalisation\nthrough large-scale pretraining, existing models operate predominantly in a\nunimodal setting, ignoring the rich multimodal context, such as visual and\ntextual signals, that often accompanies time series data in real-world\nscenarios. This paper introduces a novel parameter-efficient multimodal\nframework, UniCast, that extends TSFMs to jointly leverage time series, vision,\nand text modalities for enhanced forecasting performance.

Standard\nFederated Learning (FL) often fails in the presence of non-IID data, leading to\nmodel divergence. This paper introduces Fed-Meta-Align, a novel four-phase\nframework designed to overcome these limitations through a sophisticated\ninitialization and training pipeline. Our process begins by training a\nfoundational model on a general public dataset to establish a competent\nstarting point. This model then undergoes a serial meta-initialization phase,\nwhere it sequentially trains on a subset of IOT Device data to learn a\nheterogeneity-aware initialization that is already situated in a favorable\nregion of the loss landscape. This informed model is subsequently refined in a\nparallel FL phase, which utilizes a dual-criterion aggregation mechanism that\nweights for IOT devices updates based on both local performance and cosine\nsimilarity alignment. Finally, an on-device personalization phase adapts the\nconverged global model into a specialized expert for each IOT Device.\nComprehensive experiments demonstrate that Fed-Meta-Align achieves an average\ntest accuracy of 91.27% across heterogeneous IOT devices, outperforming\npersonalized FedAvg and FedProx by up to 3.87% and 3.37% on electrical and\nmechanical fault datasets, respectively. This multi-stage approach of sequenced\ninitialization and adaptive aggregation provides a robust pathway for deploying\nhigh-performance intelligence on diverse TinyML networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "IoT

This\npaper highlights the key techniques used during the implementation of the\nauthentication system with Passkey technology. It also suggests considerations\nfor integrating components during system development to ensure that users can\nsecurely access their accounts with minimal complexity, while still meeting the\nrequirements of a robust authentication system that balances security,\nusability, and performance. Additionally, by examining TOTP and Passkey\nmechanisms from an implementation perspective, this work not only addresses\nmajor security concerns such as password leaks, phishing attacks, and\nsusceptibility to brute-force attacks, but also evaluates the feasibility and\neffectiveness of these mechanisms in real-world implementations.

To address these gaps, we introduce the Yokai Learning Environment (YLE)\n- a multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) environment based on the\ncooperative card game Yokai. In the YLE, agents take turns peeking at hidden\ncards and moving them to form clusters based on colour. Success requires\ntracking evolving beliefs, remembering past observations, using hints as\ngrounded communication, and maintaining common ground with teammates. Our\nevaluation yields two key findings: First, current RL agents struggle to solve\nthe YLE, even when given access to perfect memory. Second, while belief\nmodelling improves performance, agents are still unable to effectively\ngeneralise to unseen partners or form accurate beliefs over longer games,\nexposing a reliance on brittle conventions rather than robust belief tracking.\nWe use the YLE to investigate research questions in belief modelling, memory,\npartner generalisation, and scaling to higher-order ToM.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud611\ub825\uc801 AI \uac1c\ubc1c\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec\uc778 ToM(\ud0c0\uc778\uc758 \uc2e0\ub150\uc744 \ucd94\ub860\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub2e4\ub8ec\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud611\ub825\uc801 AI\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ud1a0\ub300\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c, \uae30\uc874\uc758 ToM \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub294 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uad00\ucc30 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \uad6d\ud55c\ub418\uac70\ub098 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc2dc\uac04\uc774 \uc9c0\ub0a8\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uacf5\ud1b5\uc758 \uae30\ubc18\uc744 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uace0 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294\ub2e4.", "method": "Yokai Learning Environment(YLE)\ub77c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \ud611\ub825 \uce74\ub4dc \uac8c\uc784\uc778 Yokai\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c\ub2e4.

Recent works proposed rigorous\nfeature attribution using logic-based explanations, specifically targeting\nhigh-stakes uses of machine learning (ML) models. Typically, such works exploit\nweak abductive explanation (WAXp) as the characteristic function to assign\nimportance to features. However, one possible downside is that the contribution\nof non-WAXp sets is neglected. In fact, non-WAXp sets can also convey important\ninformation, because of the relationship between formal explanations (XPs) and\nadversarial examples (AExs). Accordingly, this paper leverages Shapley value\nand Banzhaf index to devise two novel feature importance scores. We take into\naccount non-WAXp sets when computing feature contribution, and the novel scores\nquantify how effective each feature is at excluding AExs.

With this framework, researchers can\nsystematically explore the functionalities of ransomware, including file\nencryption processes, cryptographic key management, and victim interaction\ndynamics.

In contrast, (social) allostasis\nproposes that these systems can proactively leverage these very perturbations\nto reconfigure their regulatory parameters in anticipation of environmental\ndemands, aligning with von Foerster's ``order through noise'' principle. This\npaper formulates a computational model of allostatic and social allostatic\nregulation that employs biophysiologically inspired signal transducers,\nanalogous to hormones like cortisol and oxytocin, to encode information from\nboth the environment and social interactions, which mediate this dynamic\nreconfiguration. The models are tested in a small society of ``animats'' across\nseveral dynamic environments, using an agent-based model. The results show that\nallostatic and social allostatic regulation enable agents to leverage\nenvironmental and social ``noise'' for adaptive reconfiguration, leading to\nimproved viability compared to purely reactive homeostatic agents. This work\noffers a novel computational perspective on the principles of social allostasis\nand their potential for designing more robust, bio-inspired, adaptive systems", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774

Synthetic\ndata generation is a promising solution, while usually facing the challenge of\nnoise labels. To address this challenge, we first introduce a chart synthesis\npipeline that generates aligned chart-question-answer triplets through code\ngeneration and execution, ensuring the reliability of synthetic data without\nhuman intervention.

We\nintegrate multiple fairness definitions including counterfactual and causal\nfairness into both its generation and evaluation pipelines.

Across diverse datasets, our method outperforms\nstate-of-the-art GAN-based and LLM-based methods, achieving up to 10%\nimprovements on fairness metrics such as demographic parity and path-specific\ncausal effects while retaining statistical utility.

The richness of MEP requires states to be represented as Kripke\nstructures, i.e., directed labeled graphs. This representation limits the\napplicability of existing heuristics, hindering the scalability of epistemic\nsolvers, which must explore an exponential search space without guidance,\nresulting often in intractability. To address this, we exploit Graph Neural\nNetworks (GNNs) to learn patterns and relational structures within epistemic\nstates, to guide the planning process. GNNs, which naturally capture the\ngraph-like nature of Kripke models, allow us to derive meaningful estimates of\nstate quality -- e.g., the distance from the nearest goal -- by generalizing\nknowledge obtained from previously solved planning instances. We integrate\nthese predictive heuristics into an epistemic planning pipeline and evaluate\nthem against standard baselines, showing significant improvements in the\nscalability of multi-agent epistemic planning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub2e4\uc218\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ud3ec\ud568\ub41c \uc778\uc2dd \uacc4\ud68d\uc758 \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(GNN)\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc815\ubcf4 \ud750\ub984\uacfc \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04 \uc778\uc2dd\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc138\uacc4\uc640 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc2e0\ub150\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uace0\ub824\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc790\uc728 \uacc4\ud68d \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c \uac1c\ubc1c\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131.", "method": "\uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(GNN)\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\ud53c\uc2a4\ud14c\ubbf9 \uc0c1\ud0dc \ub0b4\uc758 \ud328\ud134\uacfc \uad00\uacc4 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uc5ec \uacc4\ud68d \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uc548\ub0b4\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95.", "result": "\ud45c\uc900 \uae30\uc900\uc120\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc218 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc5d0\ud53c\uc2a4\ud14c\ubbf9 \uacc4\ud68d\uc5d0\uc11c \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc774 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub428\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90c.", "conclusion": "GNN \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc608\uce21\uc801 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0 \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud568.", "translated_summary": "\ub2e4\uc218 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc5d0\ud53c\uc2a4\ud14c\ubbf9 \uacc4\ud68d(MEP)\uc740 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc138\uacc4\uc640 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc2e0\ub150\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ucd94\ub860\ud558\ub294 \uc790\uc728 \uacc4\ud68d \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc815\ubcf4 \ud750\ub984\uacfc \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04 \uc778\uc2dd\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0 \uc751\uc6a9\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Update the results", "summary": "Future prediction is a complex task for LLM agents, requiring a high level of\nanalytical thinking, information gathering, contextual understanding, and\ndecision-making under uncertainty. Agents must not only gather and interpret\nvast amounts of dynamic information but also integrate diverse data sources,\nweigh uncertainties, and adapt predictions based on emerging trends, just as\nhuman experts do in fields like politics, economics, and finance. Despite its\nimportance, no large-scale benchmark exists for evaluating agents on future\nprediction, largely due to challenges in handling real-time updates and\nretrieving timely, accurate answers. To address this, we introduce\n$\\textbf{FutureX}$, a dynamic and live evaluation benchmark specifically\ndesigned for LLM agents performing future prediction tasks. FutureX is the\nlargest and most diverse live benchmark for future prediction, supporting\nreal-time daily updates and eliminating data contamination through an automated\npipeline for question gathering and answer collection. We evaluate 25 LLM/agent\nmodels, including those with reasoning, search capabilities, and integration of\nexternal tools such as the open-source Deep Research Agent and closed-source\nDeep Research models.

In this\nwork, we propose Intent-FT, a simple and lightweight fine-tuning approach that\nexplicitly trains LLMs to infer the underlying intent of an instruction before\nresponding. By fine-tuning on a targeted set of adversarial instructions,\nIntent-FT enables LLMs to generalize intent deduction to unseen attacks,\nthereby substantially improving their robustness. We comprehensively evaluate\nboth parametric and non-parametric attacks across open-source and proprietary\nmodels, considering harmfulness from attacks, utility, over-refusal, and impact\nagainst white-box threats. Empirically, Intent-FT consistently mitigates all\nevaluated attack categories, with no single attack exceeding a 50\\% success\nrate -- whereas existing defenses remain only partially effective. Importantly,\nour method preserves the model's general capabilities and reduces excessive\nrefusals on benign instructions containing superficially harmful keywords.\nFurthermore, models trained with Intent-FT accurately identify hidden harmful\nintent in adversarial attacks, and these learned intentions can be effectively\ntransferred to enhance vanilla model defenses.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uacfc \ud0dc\uc2a4\ud06c \uc131\ub2a5 \uac04\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 Intent-FT\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \uc548\uc804\uc131 \uc870\uc815\uc774 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud558\uac8c \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc84c\uc74c\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \uacf5\uaca9\uc790\ub4e4\uc774 \ub9cc\ub4e0 \uc9c0\uc2dc\uc5b4\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, \uc774\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc548\uc804\uc131\uacfc \ud0dc\uc2a4\ud06c \uc131\ub2a5 \uac04\uc758 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uade0\ud615 \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \uc874\uc7ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "Intent-FT\ub294 LLM\uc774 \uc751\ub2f5\ud558\uae30 \uc804\uc5d0 \uc9c0\uc2dc\uc0ac\ud56d\uc758 \uae30\ubcf8 \uc758\ub3c4\ub97c \ucd94\ub860\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\ub294 \uac04\ub2e8\ud558\uace0 \uac00\ubcbc\uc6b4 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815 \ubc29\ubc95\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc9c0\uc2dc\uc5b4 \uc9d1\ud569\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc5ec, Intent-FT\ub294 LLM\uc774 \ubcf4\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc758\ub3c4 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ub3c4\uc640\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "Intent-FT\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ud3c9\uac00\ub41c \uacf5\uaca9 \uce74\ud14c\uace0\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uc644\ud654\ud558\uba70, \uc5b4\ub5a4 \ub2e8\uc77c \uacf5\uaca9\ub3c4 50% \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uccb4\uacc4\ub294 \ubd80\ubd84\uc801\uc73c\ub85c\ub9cc \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18 \uc751\uc6a9 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \ud45c\uba74\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud0a4\uc6cc\ub4dc\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uc815\uc0c1 \uc9c0\uc2dc\uc0ac\ud56d\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacfc\ub3c4\ud55c \uac70\ubd80\ub97c \uc904\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c Intent-FT\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0\uc11c \uc228\uaca8\uc9c4 \ud574\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc758\ub3c4\ub97c \uc815\ud655\ud788 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc30\uc6b4 \uc758\ub3c4\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\uc774\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\ubcf8 \ubaa8\ub378 \ubc29\uc5b4\ub97c \uac15\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc870\uc815\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \uacf5\uaca9\uc790\uac00 \uc81c\uc791\ud55c \uc9c0\uc2dc\uc5b4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ud0c8\uc625 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uacfc \uc791\uc5c5 \uc131\ub2a5 \uac04\uc758 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ubc18\uc601\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 LLM\uc774 \uc751\ub2f5\ud558\uae30 \uc804\uc5d0 \uc9c0\uc2dc\uc0ac\ud56d\uc758 \uae30\ubcf8 \uc758\ub3c4\ub97c \ucd94\ub860\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\ub294 \uac04\ub2e8\ud558\uace0 \uac00\ubcbc\uc6b4 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815 \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 Intent-FT\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

While many MARL\nbenchmarks have been proposed, few combine continuous state and action spaces\nwith challenging coordination and planning tasks. We introduce CAMAR, a new\nMARL benchmark designed explicitly for multi-agent pathfinding in environments\nwith continuous actions. CAMAR supports cooperative and competitive\ninteractions between agents and runs efficiently at up to 100,000 environment\nsteps per second. We also propose a three-tier evaluation protocol to better\ntrack algorithmic progress and enable deeper analysis of performance. In\naddition, CAMAR allows the integration of classical planning methods such as\nRRT and RRT* into MARL pipelines. We use them as standalone baselines and\ncombine RRT* with popular MARL algorithms to create hybrid approaches.

Experimental results indicate that\nAIGer outperforms the current best models in the Signal Probability Prediction\n(SSP) task, improving MAE and MSE by 18.95\\% and 44.44\\%, respectively.

Although\nCNNs have long been considered a black-box classification method, they can be\nused as a white-box method through visualization techniques such as Grad-CAM.\nWhen training samples are limited, incorporating a Principal Component Analysis\n(PCA) layer and/or a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier into a CNN can\neffectively improve classification performance. However, traditional Grad-CAM\ncannot be directly applied to PCA and/or SVM layers.

Therefore, we propose ``PCA-Grad-CAM'', a\nmethod for visualizing attention regions in PCA feature vectors, and\n``SVM-Grad-CAM'', a method for visualizing attention regions in an SVM\nclassifier layer. To complete our methods analytically, it is necessary to\nsolve the closed-form Jacobian consisting of partial derivatives from the last\nconvolutional layer to the PCA and/or SVM layers.

However,\nhandling sensitive data such as medical records and financial information in\ncloud environments raises serious privacy concerns. In this paper, we present\nPP-STAT, a novel and efficient Homomorphic Encryption (HE)-based framework for\nprivacy-preserving statistical analysis. HE enables computations to be\nperformed directly on encrypted data without revealing the underlying\nplaintext. PP-STAT supports advanced statistical measures, including Z-score\nnormalization, skewness, kurtosis, coefficient of variation, and Pearson\ncorrelation coefficient, all computed securely over encrypted data. To improve\nefficiency, PP-STAT introduces two key optimizations: (1) a Chebyshev-based\napproximation strategy for initializing inverse square root operations, and (2)\na pre-normalization scaling technique that reduces multiplicative depth by\nfolding constant scaling factors into mean and variance computations.

In this paper, we investigate two key\naspects of extending linear recurrent models, especially those originally\ndesigned for language modeling, to high-order data (1D to ND): scanning\nstrategies and attention-hybrid architectures. Empirical results suggest that\nscanning provides limited benefits, while attention-hybrid models yield\npromising results. Focusing on the latter, we further evaluate types of\nattention and find that tiled high-order sliding window attention (SWA) is\nefficient in both theory and practice. We term the resulting hybrid\narchitecture of linear recurrence and high-order SWA as Efficient N-dimensional\nAttention (ENA). We then conduct several experiments to demonstrate its\neffectiveness. The intuition behind ENA is that linear recurrence compresses\nglobal information into a state, while SWA complements it by enforcing strict\nlocal modeling. Together, they form a simple framework that offers a promising\nand practical solution for ultra-long high-order data modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uae34 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc778 Efficient N-dimensional Attention (ENA)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uae30\uc874\uc758 Transformer\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub098\uc740 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud568.", "method": "\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc120\ud615 \uc21c\ud658 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud575\uc2ec \uce21\uba74(\uc2a4\uce94 \uc804\ub7b5\uacfc \uc8fc\uc758 \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98)\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uace0, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc8fc\uc758 \uc720\ud615\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc5ec \ud0c0\uc77c \uace0\ucc28 \uc2ac\ub77c\uc774\ub529 \uc708\ub3c4\uc6b0 \uc8fc\uc758(SWA)\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "SWA\uac00 \uc774\ub860\uacfc \uc2e4\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc784\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud558\uace0, ENA\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uadf8 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc785\uc99d\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "ENA\ub294 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub85c \uc555\ucd95\ud558\uace0, SWA\ub294 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \ub85c\uceec \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc5ec \ud568\uaed8 \ucd08\uc7a5\uae30 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc720\ub9dd\ud558\uace0 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uae34 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\ub97c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 Transformer\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc6d0\ub798 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc120\ud615 \uc21c\ud658 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \ub370\uc774\ud130(1D\uc5d0\uc11c ND)\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud575\uc2ec \uce21\uba74\uc778 \uc2a4\uce94 \uc804\ub7b5\uacfc \uc8fc\uc758 \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \uacb0\uacfc\uc5d0 \ub530\ub974\uba74 \uc2a4\uce94\uc740 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc774\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \ubc18\uba74, \uc8fc\uc758 \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud6c4\uc790\ub97c \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c \uc8fc\uc758\uc758 \uc720\ud615\uc744 \ucd94\uac00\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0 \ud0c0\uc77c \uace0\ucc28 \uc2ac\ub77c\uc774\ub529 \uc708\ub3c4\uc6b0 \uc8fc\uc758(SWA)\uac00 \uc774\ub860\uacfc \uc2e4\uc81c \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc784\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc120\ud615 \uc21c\ud658\uacfc \uace0\ucc28 SWA\uc758 \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c Efficient N-dimensional Attention (ENA)\ub77c\uace0 \uba85\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7f0 \ub2e4\uc74c \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uadf8 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Recent works have shown that millions of Ethereum users were targeted\nand lost over 100 million US dollars.\n  Ethereum crypto wallets, serving users in browsing transaction history and\ninitiating transactions to transfer funds, play a central role in deploying\ncountermeasures to mitigate the address poisoning attack. However, whether they\nhave done so remains an open question. To fill the research void, in this\npaper, we design experiments to simulate address poisoning attacks and\nsystematically evaluate the usability and security of 53 popular Ethereum\ncrypto wallets. Our evaluation shows that there exist communication failures\nbetween 12 wallets and their transaction activity provider, which renders them\nunable to download the users' transaction history. Besides, our evaluation also\nshows that 16 wallets pose a high risk to their users due to displaying fake\ntoken phishing transfers. Moreover, our further analysis suggests that most\nwallets rely on transaction activity providers to filter out phishing\ntransfers. However, their phishing detection capability varies. Finally, we\nfound that only three wallets throw an explicit warning message when users\nattempt to transfer to the phishing address, implying a significant gap within\nthe broader Ethereum crypto wallet community in protecting users from address\npoisoning attacks.\n  Overall, our work shows that more efforts are needed by the Ethereum crypto\nwallet developer community to achieve the highest usability and security\nstandard.

We\nintroduce a novel hierarchical taxonomy that structures the field by primary\nclinical task (diagnosis vs. prediction), data modality (text, speech,\nneuroimaging, multimodal), and computational model class (e.g., graph neural\nnetworks, large language models, hybrid approaches). Our in-depth analysis\nreveals three major trends: the predominance of graph neural networks for\nmodeling brain connectivity, the rise of large language models for linguistic\nand conversational data, and an emerging focus on multimodal fusion,\nexplainability, and algorithmic fairness. Alongside methodological insights, we\nprovide an overview of prominent public datasets and standard evaluation\nmetrics as a practical guide for researchers. By synthesizing current advances\nand highlighting open challenges, this survey offers a comprehensive roadmap\nfor future innovation in computational psychiatry.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8

Traditional forecasting methods typically\nconstruct spatiotemporal graph models by mining spatiotemporal dependencies to\npredict emissions. However, due to the multi-scale entanglement of traffic\nemissions across time and space, these spatiotemporal graph modeling method\ntend to suffer from cascading error amplification during long-term inference.\nTo address this issue, we propose a Scale-Disentangled Spatio-Temporal Modeling\n(SDSTM) framework for long-term traffic emission forecasting. It leverages the\npredictability differences across multiple scales to decompose and fuse\nfeatures at different scales, while constraining them to remain independent yet\ncomplementary. Specifically, the model first introduces a dual-stream feature\ndecomposition strategy based on the Koopman lifting operator. It lifts the\nscale-coupled spatiotemporal dynamical system into an infinite-dimensional\nlinear space via Koopman operator, and delineates the predictability boundary\nusing gated wavelet decomposition.

This\npaper introduces a hybrid architecture that replaces Bitcoin's traditional PoW\nwith a centralized, cloud-based collaborative training framework. In this\nmodel, miners contribute computing resources to train segments of horizontally\nscaled machine learning models on preprocessed datasets, ensuring privacy and\ngenerating meaningful outputs \\cite{li2017securing}. A central server evaluates\ncontributions using two metrics: number of parameters trained and reduction in\nmodel loss during each cycle. At the end of every cycle, a weighted lottery\nselects the winning miner, who receives a digitally signed certificate. This\ncertificate serves as a verifiable substitute for PoW and grants the right to\nappend a block to the blockchain \\cite{nakamoto2008bitcoin}. By integrating\ndigital signatures and SHA-256 hashing \\cite{nist2015sha}, the system preserves\nblockchain integrity while redirecting energy toward productive computation.\nThe proposed approach

Differently, the recently released\nBongard-RWR dataset aimed at representing abstract concepts formulated in the\noriginal BPs using fine-grained real-world images. Its manual construction,\nhowever, limited the dataset size to just $60$ instances, constraining\nevaluation robustness. In this work, we introduce Bongard-RWR+, a BP dataset\ncomposed of $5\\,400$ instances that represent original BP abstract concepts\nusing real-world-like images generated via a vision language model (VLM)\npipeline. Building on Bongard-RWR, we employ Pixtral-12B to describe manually\ncurated images and generate new descriptions aligned with the underlying\nconcepts, use Flux.1-dev to synthesize images from these descriptions, and\nmanually verify that the generated images faithfully reflect the intended\nconcepts. We evaluate state-of-the-art VLMs across diverse BP formulations,\nincluding binary and multiclass classification, as well as textual answer\ngeneration. Our findings reveal that while VLMs can recognize coarse-grained\nvisual concepts, they consistently struggle with discerning fine-grained\nconcepts, highlighting limitations in their reasoning capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub17c\ubb38\uc740 Bongard-RWR+\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 Bongard \ubb38\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uace0\uc720\uc758 \ucd94\uc0c1 \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \uc2e4\uc138\uacc4\uc640 \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub85c \ud45c\ud604\ud558\uace0, \ucd5c\uc2e0 \ube44\uc804 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec 5,400\uac1c\uc758 \uc608\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "Bongard \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \ucd94\uc0c1 \uc2dc\uac01 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc778 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ubca0\ub4dc\ub85c, \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uba87 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc608\uc81c\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c \uc2dc\uac01 \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4\ub85c \uc124\uba85\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "Pixtral-12B\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc218\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc120\ubcc4\ub41c \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub97c \uc124\uba85\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc124\uba85\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucd98 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uba70, Flux.1-dev\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc774 \uc124\uba85\uc774 \ubc18\uc601\ub41c \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub97c \ud569\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uac00 \uc758\ub3c4\ub41c \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \ucda9\uc2e4\ud788 \ubc18\uc601\ud558\ub294\uc9c0 \uc218\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ucd5c\uc2e0 VLMs\ub97c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c Bongard \ubb38\uc81c \ud615\uc2dd\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, VLMs\uac00 \ub300\ub7b5\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\uac01 \uac1c\ub150\uc740 \uc778\uc2dd\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc138\ubd80\uc801\uc778 \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \uc778\uc2dd\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\ub294\ub2e4\ub294 \uc0ac\uc2e4\uc774 \ubc1d\ud600\uc84c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 VLMs\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70, \uc138\ubc00\ud55c \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \uad6c\ubd84\ud558\ub294 \ub370\uc5d0\ub294 \uac1c\uc120\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "Bongard \ubb38\uc81c(BPs)\ub294 \uba87 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc608\uc81c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc2dc\uac01 \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4\ub85c \uc124\uba85\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc694\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \ucd94\uc0c1 \uc2dc\uac01 \ucd94\ub860(AVR)\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc778 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ubca0\ub4dc\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd08\uae30 BP \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub294 \ud569\uc131\ub41c \ud751\ubc31 \uadf8\ub9bc\uc744 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uc600\uc73c\ub098, \uc774\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc7a5\uba74\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \uc644\uc804\ud788 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ud6c4\uc758 BP \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc138\ud2b8\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud588\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud45c\ud604\ub41c \uac1c\ub150\uc774 \uace0\uc218\uc900 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc73c\ub85c \uc2dd\ubcc4 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uc5ec \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \uc904\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc\uc5d0 \ubc1c\ud45c\ub41c Bongard-RWR \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc138\ud2b8\ub294 \uc6d0\ub798 BP\uc5d0\uc11c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \ucd94\uc0c1 \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \uc138\ubc00\ud55c \uc2e4\uc81c \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub85c \ud45c\ud604\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc218\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\ucd95\ub41c \uc774 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc138\ud2b8\ub294 \ub2e8\uc9c0 60\uac1c\uc758 \uc0ac\ub840\ub85c \uc81c\ud55c\ub418\uc5b4 \ud3c9\uac00\uc758 \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 5,400\uac1c\uc758 \uc0ac\ub840\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c BP \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc138\ud2b8\uc778 Bongard-RWR+\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ube44\uc804 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(VLM) \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \uc2e4\uc138\uacc4\uc640 \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc6d0\ub798 BP \ucd94\uc0c1 \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \ud45c\ud604\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

By connecting the exploitation of individual vulnerabilities, AGs\nexpose possible multi-step attacks against target networks, allowing system\nadministrators to take preventive measures to enhance their network's security.\nAs powerful analytical tools, however, AGs are both time- and memory-consuming\nto be generated. As the numbers of network assets, interconnections between\ndevices, as well as vulnerabilities increase, the size and volume of the\nresulting AGs grow at a much higher rate, leading to the well-known state-space\nexplosion. In this paper, we propose the use of high performance computing\n(HPC) clusters to implement AG generators.

In this way, adaptive agents are able to\nmaximise the likelihood of preferred observations or states, given a generative\nmodel of the environment. In the literature, however, different strategies have\nbeen proposed to describe how agents can plan their future actions. While they\nall share the notion that some kind of expected free energy offers an\nappropriate way to score policies, sequences of actions, in terms of their\ndesirability, there are different ways to consider the contribution of past\nmotor experience to the agent's future behaviour. In some approaches, agents\nare assumed to know their own actions, and use such knowledge to better plan\nfor the future. In other approaches, agents are unaware of their actions, and\nmust infer their motor behaviour from recent observations in order to plan for\nthe future. This difference reflects a standard point of departure in two\nleading frameworks in motor control based on the presence, or not, of an\nefference copy signal representing knowledge about an agent's own actions.

A single OOD detector may not\nprevail across all the scenarios; therefore, how can we automatically select an\nideal OOD detection model for different distribution shifts? Due to the\ninherent unsupervised nature of the OOD detection task, it is difficult to\npredict model performance and find a universally Best model. Also,\nsystematically comparing models on the new unseen data is costly or even\nimpractical. To address this challenge, we introduce M3OOD, a\nmeta-learning-based framework for OOD detector selection in multimodal\nsettings. Meta learning offers a solution by learning from historical model\nbehaviors, enabling rapid adaptation to new data distribution shifts with\nminimal supervision. Our approach combines multimodal embeddings with\nhandcrafted meta-features that capture distributional and cross-modal\ncharacteristics to represent datasets. By leveraging historical performance\nacross diverse multimodal benchmarks, M3OOD can recommend suitable detectors\nfor a new data distribution shift.

Promptware Attacks Against LLM-Powered Assistants in Production Are Practical and Dangerous", "comment": "https://sites.google.com/view/invitation-is-all-you-need/home", "summary": "The growing integration of LLMs into applications has introduced new security\nrisks, notably known as Promptware - maliciously engineered prompts designed to\nmanipulate LLMs to compromise the CIA triad of these applications. While prior\nresearch warned about a potential shift in the threat landscape for LLM-powered\napplications, the risk posed by Promptware is frequently perceived as low. In\nthis paper, we investigate the risk Promptware poses to users of Gemini-powered\nassistants (web application, mobile application, and Google Assistant). We\npropose a novel Threat Analysis and Risk Assessment (TARA) framework to assess\nPromptware risks for end users. Our analysis focuses on a new variant of\nPromptware called Targeted Promptware Attacks, which leverage indirect prompt\ninjection via common user interactions such as emails, calendar invitations,\nand shared documents. We demonstrate 14 attack scenarios applied against\nGemini-powered assistants across five identified threat classes: Short-term\nContext Poisoning, Permanent Memory Poisoning, Tool Misuse, Automatic Agent\nInvocation, and Automatic App Invocation. These attacks highlight both digital\nand physical consequences, including spamming, phishing, disinformation\ncampaigns, data exfiltration, unapproved user video streaming, and control of\nhome automation devices. We reveal Promptware's potential for on-device lateral\nmovement, escaping the boundaries of the LLM-powered application, to trigger\nmalicious actions using a device's applications. Our TARA reveals that 73% of\nthe analyzed threats pose High-Critical risk to end users. We discuss\nmitigations and reassess the risk (in response to deployed mitigations) and\nshow that the risk could be reduced significantly to Very Low-Medium. We\ndisclosed our findings to Google, which deployed dedicated mitigations.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM \ud1b5\ud569 \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548 \ub9ac\uc2a4\ud06c\uc5d0

Controller Area Network (CAN) is one of\nthe most recognized protocols that offer reliable data transmission in smart\ngrids due to its robustness, real-time capabilities, and relatively low initial\ncost of its required hardware. However, as a smart city becomes more\ninterconnected, it also becomes more vulnerable to cyber-attacks. As there are\nmany mechanisms to secure the CAN nodes from attacks, most of those mechanisms\nhave computational overhead, resulting in more delay in the network. We\nimplemented a solution that requires almost no overhead to any CAN node\nconnected to the network. It depends on a single node responsible for securing\nthe CAN network. This approach seeks to augment network security while reducing\nsecurity mechanisms overhead to all CAN network nodes.

However, current reasoning models often lack\nexplicit semantic hierarchies, user-domain knowledge alignment, and principled\nmechanisms to prune reasoning threads for effectiveness. These limitations\nresult in lengthy generic output that does not guide users through\ngoal-oriented reasoning steps. To address this, we propose a\nprototype-inspired, two-phases Reasoning-Threads-Evaluation (ReT-Eval)\nframework, drawing inspiration from human-like reasoning strategies that\nemphasize structured knowledge reuse. In the first phase, semantically relevant\nknowledge structures are extracted from a sparse domain knowledge graph using a\ngraph neural network and enriched with intrinsic large language model knowledge\nto resolve knowledge discrepancies. In the second phase, these threads are\nevaluated and pruned using a reward-guided strategy aimed at maintaining\nsemantic coherence to generate effective reasoning threads. Experiments and\nexpert evaluations show that ReT-Eval enhances user understanding and\noutperforms state-of-the-art reasoning models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c ReT-Eval \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc758 \uc774\ud574\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ub2a5\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ucd94\ub860 \uc2a4\ub808\ub4dc\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud654\ud615 \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc774\ud574\ub97c \ubc18\uc601\ud558\uace0 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucd98 \ucd94\ub860 \uc2a4\ub808\ub4dc\ub97c \ub9cc\ub4dc\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "ReT-Eval \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ub450 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub418\uba70, \uba3c\uc800 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud574 \uad00\ub828 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\uace0 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\uc644\ud55c \ud6c4, \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uae30\ubc18 \uc804\ub7b5\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\ub860 \uc2a4\ub808\ub4dc\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0 \ub2e4\ub4ec\ub294\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8\uacfc \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 ReT-Eval\uc774 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc774\ud574\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \ucd5c\uc2e0 \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud568\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "ReT-Eval\uc740 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\ub294 \uc778\ub958\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \uc804\ub7b5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc544 \uac1c\ubc1c\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc778\ud130\ub799\ud2f0\ube0c \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd94\ub860\uc740 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc774\ud574\ub97c \ubc18\uc601\ud558\uace0 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucd98 \ucd94\ub860 \uc2a4\ub808\ub4dc\ub97c \uad6c\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801 \uc758\ubbf8 \uacc4\uce35, \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790-\ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc815\ub82c, \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uc2a4\ub808\ub4dc \uac00\uc9c0\uce58\uae30\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc6d0\uce59\uc801\uc778 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774 \uacb0\uc5ec\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub294 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc9c0\ud5a5\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\ub97c \uc548\ub0b4\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \uae38\uace0 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\ub294 \uc778\uac04\uacfc \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uc804\ub7b5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc740 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ud0c0\uc785 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ub450 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c Reasoning-Threads-Evaluation (ReT-Eval) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud76c\uc18c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc5d0\uc11c \uc758\ubbf8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad00\ub828 \uc788\ub294 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\uace0, \uc9c0\uc2dd \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub0b4\uc7ac\ub41c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\uac15\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub450 \ubc88\uc9f8 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc2a4\ub808\ub4dc\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uae30\ubc18 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\ub4ec\uc5b4 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ucd94\ub860 \uc2a4\ub808\ub4dc\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8\uacfc \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \ud3c9\uac00 \uacb0\uacfc, ReT-Eval\uc774 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc774\ud574\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ub2a5\uac00\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4."}}

However, as the number of published\napps grows, there is a notable lack of robust headless tools for user interface\n(UI) exploration and user event testing. To address this need, we present\nAUTOVR, an automatic framework for dynamic UI and user event interaction in VR\napps built on the Unity Engine.

While effective in bi-modal setups, these\napproaches struggle to generalize across multiple modalities and often lack\nsemantic structure in high-dimensional spaces. In this paper, we propose MOVER,\na novel framework that combines optimal transport-based soft alignment with\nvolume-based geometric regularization to build semantically aligned and\nstructured multimodal representations. By integrating a transport-guided\nmatching mechanism with a geometric volume minimization objective (GAVE), MOVER\nencourages consistent alignment across all modalities in a modality-agnostic\nmanner. Experiments on text-video-audio retrieval tasks demonstrate that MOVER\nsignificantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in both zero-shot and\nfinetuned settings.

This\ncharacteristic long-tailed distribution severely impedes the extraction of\ndiscriminative features for emission state identification during data mining.\nFurthermore, the highly nonlinear nature of vehicle emission states and the\nlack of relevant prior knowledge also pose significant challenges to the\nconstruction of identification models.To address the aforementioned issues, we\npropose a Set-Valued Transformer Network (SVTN) to achieve comprehensive\nlearning of discriminative features from high-emission samples, thereby\nenhancing detection accuracy. Specifically, this model first employs the\ntransformer to measure the temporal similarity of micro-trip condition\nvariations, thus constructing a mapping rule that projects the original\nhigh-dimensional emission data into a low-dimensional feature space. Next, a\nset-valued identification algorithm is used to probabilistically model the\nrelationship between the generated feature vectors and their labels, providing\nan accurate metric criterion for the classification algorithm. To validate the\neffectiveness of our proposed approach, we conducted extensive experiments on\nthe diesel vehicle monitoring data of Hefei city in 2020.

Traditional\nRLHF requires expensive, verified reward signals that are impractical in many\nreal-world domains. RLNVR addresses this challenge through baseline\nnormalization and semantic similarity-based reward transfer. We demonstrate\nRLNVR through Walter, a prototype system that optimizes social media content\ngeneration using actual engagement data from Bluesky.

However, preserving the\nprivacy of both user inputs and fine-tuned adapters -- often trained on\nsensitive data -- during inference remains a significant challenge. Applying\ncryptographic techniques, such as multi-party computation (MPC), to PEFT\nsettings still incurs substantial encrypted computation across both the\nbackbone and adapter, mainly due to the inherent two-way communication between\nthem. To address this limitation, we propose CryptPEFT, the first PEFT solution\nspecifically designed for private inference scenarios. CryptPEFT introduces a\nnovel one-way communication (OWC) architecture that confines encrypted\ncomputation solely to the adapter, significantly reducing both computational\nand communication overhead. To maintain strong model utility under this\nconstraint, we explore the design space of OWC-compatible adapters and employ\nan automated architecture search algorithm to optimize the trade-off between\nprivate inference efficiency and model utility. We evaluated CryptPEFT using\nVision Transformer backbones across widely used image classification datasets.\nOur results show that CryptPEFT significantly outperforms existing baselines,\ndelivering speedups ranging from $20.62\\times$ to $291.48\\times$ in simulated\nwide-area network (WAN) and local-area network (LAN) settings. On CIFAR-100,\nCryptPEFT attains 85.47% accuracy with just 2.26 seconds of inference latency.\nThese findings demonstrate that CryptPEFT offers an efficient and\nprivacy-preserving solution for modern PEFT-based inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "CryptPEFT\ub294 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ube44\uacf5\uc2dd \uc778\ud37c\ub7f0\uc2a4 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub41c \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815(PEFT) \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uacbd\ub7c9 \uc5b4\ub311\ud130\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ud604\ub300 \uba38\uc2e0 \ub7ec\ub2dd \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc785\ub825 \ubc0f \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ub41c \uc5b4\ub311\ud130\uc758 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ud070 \ubb38\uc81c\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "CryptPEFT\ub294 \uc554\ud638\ud654\ub41c \uacc4\uc0b0\uc744 \uc5b4\ub311\ud130\uc5d0\ub9cc \uad6d\ud55c\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub2e8\ubc29\ud5a5 \ud1b5\uc2e0(OWC) \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uace0, OWC \ud638\ud658 \uc5b4\ub311\ud130\uc758 \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\uba70, \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \ubaa8\ub378 \uc720\ud2f8\ub9ac\ud2f0 \uc0ac\uc774\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "CryptPEFT\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ubd84\ub958 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c Vision Transformer \ubc31\ubcf8\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud574 \ud3c9\uac00\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uae30\uc874 \uae30\uc900 \ub300\ube44 $20.62\times$\uc5d0\uc11c $291.48\times$\uc758 \uc18d\ub3c4 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "CryptPEFT\ub294 \ud604\ub300 PEFT \uae30\ubc18 \uc778\ud37c\ub7f0\uc2a4\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638\ub97c \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uacf5\uac1c\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378(\uc989, \ubc31\ubcf8)\uacfc \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815(PEFT)\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uacbd\ub7c9 \uc5b4\ub311\ud130\ub294 \ud604\ub300 \uba38\uc2e0 \ub7ec\ub2dd \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \ud45c\uc900 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\uac00 \ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ucd94\ub860 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc785\ub825 \ubc0f \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815 \uc5b4\ub311\ud130\uc758 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub85c \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc790\uac04 \uacc4\uc0b0(MPC)\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc554\ud638\ud654 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 PEFT \uc124\uc815\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ubc31\ubcf8\uacfc \uc5b4\ub311\ud130 \uac04\uc758 \uace0\uc720\ud55c \uc591\ubc29\ud5a5 \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc554\ud638\ud654 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \uc778\ud37c\ub7f0\uc2a4 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0 \ud2b9\ubcc4\ud788 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 PEFT \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc778 CryptPEFT\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

We introduce Mantis, a foundation model trained entirely on\nmechanistic simulations, which enables out-of-the-box forecasting across\ndiseases, regions, and outcomes, even in settings with limited historical data.\nMantis is built on over 400 million simulated days of outbreak dynamics\nspanning diverse pathogens, transmission modes, interventions, and surveillance\nartifacts. Despite requiring no real-world data during training, Mantis\noutperformed 39 expert-tuned models we tested across six diseases, including\nall models in the CDC's COVID-19 Forecast Hub. Mantis generalized to novel\nepidemiological regimes, including diseases with held-out transmission\nmechanisms, demonstrating that it captures fundamental contagion dynamics.\nCritically, Mantis is mechanistically interpretable, enabling public health\ndecision-makers to identify the latent drivers behind its predictions.

With such an annotation method, we construct RQA-70K, a large-scale\ndataset with varying difficulty levels for radar forecast quality evaluation.\nWe further design a multi-stage training strategy that iteratively improves\nmodel performance at each stage. Extensive experiments show that RadarQA\noutperforms existing general MLLMs across all evaluation settings, highlighting\nits potential for advancing quality analysis in weather prediction.", "AI": {"tldr": "MLLM \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ub0a0\uc528 \uc608\ubcf4 \ubd84\uc11d \ubc29\ubc95, RadarQA\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ud3c9\uac00 \uc9c0\ud45c\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uace0 \ub0a0\uc528 \uc608\uce21 \ud488\uc9c8 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub0a0\uc528 \uc608\ubcf4\uc758 \ud488\uc9c8 \ubd84\uc11d\uc740 \uae30\uc0c1\ud559\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec \uc8fc\uc81c\uc784\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ud3c9\uac00 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \ud55c\uacc4\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "MLLM \uae30\ubc18\uc758 RadarQA \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0, \uc778\uac04 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \ub77c\ubca8\ub9c1\uacfc \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc8fc\uc11d \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uc5ec RQA-70K \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "RadarQA\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ud3c9\uac00 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \uc77c\ubc18 MLLM\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "RadarQA\ub294 \ub0a0\uc528 \uc608\uce21\uc758 \ud488\uc9c8 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ubc1c\uc804\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ub370 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc774 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub0a0\uc528 \uc608\ubcf4\uc758 \ud488\uc9c8 \ubd84\uc11d\uc740 \uae30\uc0c1\ud559\uc5d0\uc11c \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc778 \uc8fc\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc810\uc218 \uae30\ubc18 \ud3c9\uac00 \uc9c0\ud45c\ub294 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc608\ubcf4 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc124\uba85 \ub2a5\ub825, \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \ubc0f \ub3d9\uc801 \uc9c4\ud654 \uc774\ud574 \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc0c1 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc640\ub294 \uac70\ub9ac\uac00 \uba49\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(MLLM)\uc758 \ube60\ub978 \ubc1c\uc804\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc704\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uad6c\uac00 \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud575\uc2ec \ubb3c\ub9ac \uc18d\uc131\uacfc \uc0c1\uc138\ud55c \ud3c9\uac00 \ubcf4\uace0\uc11c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c MLLM \uae30\ubc18 \ub0a0\uc528 \uc608\ubcf4 \ubd84\uc11d \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 RadarQA\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc0f \ud310\ub2e8 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e8\uc77c \ud504\ub808\uc784 \ubc0f \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ud488\uc9c8 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud6c8\ub828 \ubc0f \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud0b9\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc778\uac04 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \ub77c\ubca8\ub9c1\uacfc \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc8fc\uc11d \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc8fc\uc11d \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub808\uc774\ub354 \uc608\ubcf4 \ud488\uc9c8 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub09c\uc774\ub3c4\uc758 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b RQA-70K\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd94\uac00\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \uac01 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa8\ub378 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 RadarQA\uac00 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ud3c9\uac00 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \uc77c\ubc18 MLLM\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, \ub0a0\uc528 \uc608\uce21 \ud488\uc9c8 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ubc1c\uc804\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ub370 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc774 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Diffusion Large Language Model May Demand a Distinct Position", "comment": null, "summary": "Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) have recently emerged as a\ncompetitive non-autoregressive paradigm due to their unique training and\ninference approach. However, there is currently a lack of safety study on this\nnovel architecture. In this paper, we present the first analysis of dLLMs'\nsafety performance and propose a novel safety alignment method tailored to\ntheir unique generation characteristics. Specifically, we identify a critical\nasymmetry between the defender and attacker in terms of security. For the\ndefender, we reveal that the middle tokens of the response, rather than the\ninitial ones, are more critical to the overall safety of dLLM outputs; this\nseems to suggest that aligning middle tokens can be more beneficial to the\ndefender. The attacker, on the contrary, may have limited power to manipulate\nmiddle tokens, as we find dLLMs have a strong tendency towards a sequential\ngeneration order in practice, forcing the attack to meet this distribution and\ndiverting it from influencing the critical middle tokens.

While\nexisting self-feedback methods aim to address this problem, they are\nconstrained by the capabilities of a single model, which can lead to\noverconfidence in incorrect answers, reward hacking, and even training\ncollapse. To this end, we propose Reinforcement Learning from Coevolutionary\nCollective Feedback (RLCCF), a novel RL framework that enables multi-model\ncollaborative evolution without external supervision. Specifically, RLCCF\noptimizes the ability of a model collective by maximizing its Collective\nConsistency (CC), which jointly trains a diverse ensemble of LLMs and provides\nreward signals by voting on collective outputs. Moreover, each model's vote is\nweighted by its Self-Consistency (SC) score, ensuring that more confident\nmodels contribute more to the collective decision. Benefiting from the diverse\noutput distributions and complementary abilities of multiple LLMs, RLCCF\nenables the model collective to continuously enhance its reasoning ability\nthrough coevolution. Experiments on four mainstream open-source LLMs across\nfour mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our framework yields\nsignificant performance gains, achieving an average relative improvement of\n16.72\\% in accuracy. Notably, RLCCF not only improves the performance of\nindividual models but also enhances the group's majority-voting accuracy by\n4.51\\%, demonstrating its ability to extend the collective capability

This approach not only addresses privacy concerns\nbut also allows access to overall substantially larger and potentially more\ndiverse datasets, without the need for centralized storage or hardware\nresources. However, heterogeneity in client data may cause certain clients to\nhave disproportionate impacts on the global model, leading to disparities in\nthe clients' performances. Fairness, therefore, becomes a crucial concern in FL\nand can be addressed in various ways. However, the effectiveness of existing\nfairness-aware methods, particularly in heterogeneous data settings, remains\nunclear, and the relationships between different approaches are not well\nunderstood. In this work, we focus on performance equitable fairness, which\naims to minimize differences in performance across clients. We restrict our\nstudy to fairness-aware methods that explicitly regularize client losses,\nevaluating both existing and newly proposed approaches. We identify and\ntheoretically explain connections between the investigated fairness methods,\nand empirically show that FairGrad (approximate) and FairGrad* (exact) (two\nvariants of a gradient variance regularization method introduced here for\nperformance equitable fairness) improve both fairness and overall model\nperformance in heterogeneous data settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ube44\ub300\uce6d \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uacf5\uc815\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uba70, \uc131\ub2a5 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ucd94\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \ubd84\uc0b0 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc18c\uc2a4 \uac04\uc758 \ud611\uc5c5 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0 \ub354 \ud06c\uace0 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131 \uc788\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \uc811\uadfc\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uc190\uc2e4\uc744 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uaddc\uc81c\ud558\ub294 \uacf5\uc815\uc131 \uc778\uc2dd \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uc5b4 \uae30\uc874 \ubc0f \uc0c8\ub86d\uac8c \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "FairGrad(\uadfc\uc0ac)\uc640 FairGrad*(\uc815\ud655)\ub77c\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubcc0\ud615 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uacfc \ubaa8\ub378 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b4\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uacf5\uc815\uc131 \ubc29\ubc95 \uac04\uc758 \uc5f0\uacb0 \uace0\ub9ac\ub97c \ubc1d\ud600\ub0b4\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc124\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5(FL)\uc740 \uc6d0\uc2dc \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uad50\ud658\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \ubd84\uc0b0 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc18c\uc2a4 \uac04\uc758 \ud611\uc5c5 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \ud604\ub300 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc73c\ub85c \ub5a0\uc62c\ub790\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uc911\uc2dd \uc800\uc7a5\uc18c\ub098 \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uc790\uc6d0 \uc5c6\uc774 \ud6e8\uc52c \ub354 \ud06c\uace0 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0 \uc811\uadfc\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc77c\ubd80 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\uac00 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ubd88\uade0\ud615\uc801\uc778 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\uace0 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uc131\ub2a5 \uac04\uc758 \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc740 FL\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uace0\ub824\uc0ac\ud56d\uc774 \ub418\uba70 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub8f0 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uacf5\uc815\uc131 \uc778\uc2dd \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub294 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ubd88\ubd84\uba85\ud558\uba70, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd \uac04\uc758 \uad00\uacc4\ub3c4 \uc798 \uc774\ud574\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc5d0 \uc8fc\ubaa9\ud558\uace0, \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uc190\uc2e4\uc744 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uaddc\uc81c\ud558\ub294 \uacf5\uc815\uc131 \uc778\uc2dd \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc81c\ud55c\ud558\uba70 \uae30\uc874 \ubc0f \uc0c8\ub86d\uac8c \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc870\uc0ac\ub41c \uacf5\uc815\uc131 \ubc29\ubc95 \uac04\uc758 \uc5f0\uacb0 \uace0\ub9ac\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc124\uba85\ud558\uba70, FairGrad(\uadfc\uc0ac) \ubc0f FairGrad*(\uc815\ud655)\ub77c\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubcc0\ud615\uc774 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uacfc \uc804\uccb4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Most existing MAS\nobservability frameworks focus on analyzing each individual agent separately,\noverlooking failures associated with the entire MAS. To bridge this gap, we\npropose LumiMAS, a novel MAS observability framework that incorporates advanced\nanalytics and monitoring techniques. The proposed framework consists of three\nkey components: a monitoring and logging layer, anomaly detection layer, and\nanomaly explanation layer. LumiMAS's first layer monitors MAS executions,\ncreating detailed logs of the agents' activity. These logs serve as input to\nthe anomaly detection layer, which detects anomalies across the MAS workflow in\nreal time. Then, the anomaly explanation layer performs classification and root\ncause analysis (RCA) of the detected anomalies. LumiMAS was evaluated on seven\ndifferent MAS applications, implemented using two popular MAS platforms, and a\ndiverse set of possible failures. The applications include two novel\nfailure-tailored applications that illustrate the effects of a hallucination or\nbias on the MAS.

As current\nFID methods are based on chain of thought without considering dependencies\namong target classes. To capture and explore dependencies, we propose a\nhierarchical knowledge guided fault intensity diagnosis framework (HKG)\ninspired by the tree of thought, which is amenable to any representation\nlearning methods. The HKG uses graph convolutional networks to map the\nhierarchical topological graph of class representations into a set of\ninterdependent global hierarchical classifiers, where each node is denoted by\nword embeddings of a class. These global hierarchical classifiers are applied\nto learned deep features extracted by representation learning, allowing the\nentire model to be end-to-end learnable. In addition, we develop a re-weighted\nhierarchical knowledge correlation matrix (Re-HKCM) scheme by embedding\ninter-class hierarchical knowledge into a data-driven statistical correlation\nmatrix (SCM) which effectively guides the information sharing of nodes in\ngraphical convolutional neural networks and avoids over-smoothing issues. The\nRe-HKCM is derived from the SCM through a series of mathematical\ntransformations.

Existing AIGC services usually assume that the accuracy of\nthe generated content can be ensured, given accurate input data and prompt,\nthus only the content generation quality (CGQ) is concerned. However, it is not\napplicable in ISAC-based AIGC networks, where content generation is based on\ninaccurate sensed data. Moreover, the AIGC model itself introduces generation\nerrors, which depend on the number of generating steps (i.e., computing\nresources). To assess the quality of experience of ISAC-based AIGC services, we\npropose a content accuracy and quality aware service assessment metric (CAQA).\nSince allocating more resources to sensing and generating improves content\naccuracy but may reduce communication quality, and vice versa, this\nsensing-generating (computing)-communication three-dimensional resource\ntradeoff must be optimized to maximize the average CAQA (AvgCAQA) across all\nusers with AIGC (CAQA-AIGC). This problem is NP-hard, with a large solution\nspace that grows exponentially with users. To solve the CAQA-AIGC problem with\nlow complexity, a linear programming (LP) guided deep reinforcement learning\n(DRL) algorithm with an action filter (LPDRL-F) is proposed. Through the\nLP-guided approach and the action filter, LPDRL-F can transform the original\nthree-dimensional solution space to two dimensions, reducing complexity while\nimproving the learning performance of DRL. Simulations show that compared to\nexisting DRL and generative diffusion model algorithms without LP, LPDRL-F\nconverges faster by over 60% and finds better resource allocation solutions,\nimproving AvgCAQA by more than 14%. With LPDRL-F, CAQA-AIGC can achieve an\nimprovement in AvgCAQA of more than 50% compared to existing schemes focusing\nsolely on CGQ.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 ISAC \uae30\ubc18 AIGC \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc758 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc778 CAQA\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc800\ubcf5\uc7a1\ub3c4\uc758 LPDRL-F \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc790\uc6d0 \ud560\ub2f9 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc774\ub8e8\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 AIGC \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\ub294 \uc785\ub825 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \uac00\uc815\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, ISAC \uae30\ubc18 AIGC \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubd80\uc815\ud655\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\ubbc0\ub85c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud488\uc9c8 \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc800\ubcf5\uc7a1\ub3c4\uc758 \uc120\ud615 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d(LP) \uae30\ubc18 \uc2ec\uce35 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(DRL) \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc778 LPDRL-F\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc790\uc6d0 \ud560\ub2f9 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uacb0\uacfc, LPDRL-F\ub294 \uae30\uc874\uc758 DRL \ubc0f \uc0dd\uc131\uc801 \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 60% \uc774\uc0c1 \ube60\ub974\uac8c \uc218\ub834\ud558\uace0, \uc790\uc6d0 \ud560\ub2f9 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uc5ec AvgCAQA\ub97c 14% \uc774\uc0c1 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "LPDRL-F\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uae30\uc874 CGQ \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\ubcf4\ub2e4 50% \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 AvgCAQA \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud1b5\ud569 \uac10\uc9c0 \ubc0f \ud1b5\uc2e0(ISAC)\uc740 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uac10\uc9c0 \ubc0f \uc804\uc1a1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \uc0dd\uc131 \ucf58\ud150\uce20(AIGC) \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 AIGC \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\ub294 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc785\ub825 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \uc804\uc81c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \ucf58\ud150\uce20\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \uac00\uc815\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, ISAC \uae30\ubc18 AIGC \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubd80\uc815\ud655\ud55c \uac10\uc9c0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uc5ec \ucf58\ud150\uce20 \uc0dd\uc131\uc774 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc9d1\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, AIGC \ubaa8\ub378 \uc790\uccb4\uac00 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \uc720\ubc1c\ud558\uba70 \uc774\ub294 \uc0dd\uc131 \ub2e8\uacc4 \uc218(\uc989, \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc790\uc6d0)\uc758 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubc1b\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Observing unsolicited and erroneous traffic, such as unanswered\ntraffic or errors, is fundamental to detect misconfiguration, temporary\nfailures or attacks. ChamaleoNet transforms any production network into a\ntransparent monitor to let administrators collect unsolicited and erroneous\ntraffic directed to hosts, whether offline or active, hosting a server or a\nclient, protected by a firewall, or unused addresses. ChamaleoNet is programmed\nto ignore well-formed traffic and collect only erroneous packets, including\nthose generated by misconfigured or infected internal hosts, and those sent by\nexternal actors which scan for services. Engineering such a system poses\nseveral challenges, from scalability to privacy. Leveraging the SDN paradigm,\nChamaleoNet processes the traffic flowing through a campus/corporate network\nand focuses on erroneous packets only, lowering the pressure on the collection\nsystem while respecting privacy regulations by design. ChamaleoNet enables the\nseamless integration with active deceptive systems like honeypots that can\nimpersonate unused hosts/ports/services and engage with senders. The SDN\nin-hardware filtering reduces the traffic to the controller by 96%, resulting\nin a scalable solution, which we offer as open source. Simple analytics unveil\ninternal misconfigured and infected hosts, identify temporary failures, and\nenhance visibility on external radiation produced by attackers looking for\nvulnerable services.", "AI": {"tldr": "ChamaleoNet\uc740 \ud504\ub85c\ub355\uc158 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud22c\uba85\ud55c \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\uc5ec \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \ud2b8\ub798\ud53d\uc744 \uc218\uc9d1\ud558\uace0, \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \uacf5\uaca9 \ubc0f \uad6c\uc131 \uc624\ub958 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub97c \uc6a9\uc774\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud2b8\ub798\ud53d \uac00\uc2dc\uc131\uc740 \uad00\ub9ac \ubc0f \ubcf4\uc548 \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec \uc694\uc18c\ub85c, \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \ud2b8\ub798\ud53d\uc744 \uad00\ucc30\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "ChamaleoNet\uc740 SDN \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud574 \ucea0\ud37c\uc2a4/\uae30\uc5c5 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud750\ub974\ub294 \ud2b8\ub798\ud53d\uc744 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uace0, \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \ud328\ud0b7\uc5d0\ub9cc \uc9d1\uc911\ud558\uc5ec \uc218\uc9d1 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ubd80\ub2f4\uc744 \uc904\uc778\ub2e4.", "result": "ChamaleoNet\uc740 \uc218\uc9d1 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc555\ub825\uc744 \ub0ae\ucd94\uba74\uc11c 96%\uc758 \ud2b8\ub798\ud53d \ud544\ud130\ub9c1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc624\ud508 \uc18c\uc2a4\ub85c \uc81c\uacf5\ub418\uba70, \ub0b4\ubd80 \uad6c\uc131 \uc624\ub958 \ubc0f \uac10\uc5fc\ub41c \ud638\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b4\uace0 \uacf5\uaca9\uc790\uc758 \uc678\ubd80 \ubc29\uc0ac\uc120 \uac00\uc2dc\uc131\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud2b8\ub798\ud53d \uac00\uc2dc\uc131\uc740 \uad00\ub9ac \ubc0f \ubcf4\uc548 \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec \uc694\uc18c\ub85c \ub0a8\uc544\uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc751\ub2f5\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \ud2b8\ub798\ud53d\uc774\ub098 \uc624\ub958\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc6d0\uce58 \uc54a\ub294 \ud2b8\ub798\ud53d\uc744 \uad00\ucc30\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \uad6c\uc131, \uc77c\uc2dc\uc801\uc778 \uc2e4\ud328 \ub610\ub294 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \uac10\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Foundation models pretrained on large-scale medical event\ndata represent a promising direction for scaling real-world evidence generation\nand generalizing to diverse downstream tasks. Using Epic Cosmos, a dataset with\nmedical events from de-identified longitudinal health records for 16.3 billion\nencounters over 300 million unique patient records from 310 health systems, we\nintroduce the Cosmos Medical Event Transformer ( CoMET) models, a family of\ndecoder-only transformer models pretrained on 118 million patients representing\n115 billion discrete medical events (151 billion tokens). We present the\nlargest scaling-law study for medical event data, establishing a methodology\nfor pretraining and revealing power-law scaling relationships for compute,\ntokens, and model size. Based on this, we pretrained a series of\ncompute-optimal models with up to 1 billion parameters. Conditioned on a\npatient's real-world history, CoMET autoregressively generates the next medical\nevent, simulating patient health timelines. We studied 78 real-world tasks,\nincluding diagnosis prediction, disease prognosis, and healthcare operations.\nRemarkably for a foundation model with generic pretraining and simulation-based\ninference, CoMET generally outperformed or matched task-specific supervised\nmodels on these tasks, without requiring task-specific fine-tuning or few-shot\nexamples. CoMET's predictive power consistently improves as the model and\npretraining scale. Our results show that CoMET, a generative medical event\nfoundation model, can effectively capture complex clinical dynamics, providing\nan extensible and generalizable framework to support clinical decision-making,\nstreamline healthcare operations, and improve patient outcomes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c \uc758\ud559\uc744 \uc2e4\ud604\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \ud658\uc790\uc758 \uc7a5\uae30\uc801\uc778 \uc5ec\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc758\ub8cc \uc0ac\uac74\uc758 \uc21c\uc5f4\ub85c \ubcfc \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 116\uc5b5 \uac74\uc758 \uc758\ub8cc \uc0ac\uac74\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc758\ub8cc \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc804\ud6c8\ub828\ub41c Cosmos \uc758\ub8cc \uc0ac\uac74 \ud2b8\ub79c\uc2a4\ud3ec\uba38(CoMET) \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uace0, \uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc2e4\uc81c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c \uc758\ud559\uc758 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc2e4\ud604\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc7a5\uae30\uc801\uc778 \ud658\uc790 \uc5ec\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc758\ub8cc \uc0ac\uac74 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc778 Epic Cosmos\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c 1\uc5b5 1800\ub9cc \uba85\uc758 \ud658\uc790\uc758 1150\uc5b5 \uac1c\uc758 \uc758\ub8cc \uc0ac\uac74\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc804\ud6c8\ub828\ub41c CoMET \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uba70, \uc758\ub8cc \uc0ac\uac74 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uaddc\ubaa8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc9c4\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "CoMET\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uc0ac\uc804\ud6c8\ub828\uacfc \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uae30\ubc18 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud2b9\uc815 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucd98 \uc9c0\ub3c4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "CoMET\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc784\uc0c1 \uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc0dd\uc131\uc801 \uc758\ub8cc \uc0ac\uac74 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c, \uc784\uc0c1 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uace0 \ud5ec\uc2a4\ucf00\uc5b4 \uc6b4\uc601\uc744 \uac04\uc18c\ud654\ud558\uba70 \ud658\uc790 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c \uc758\ud559 \uc2e4\ud604\uc744 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uae34 \ud658\uc790 \uc5ec\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \uc815\uc81c\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc758\ub8cc \uc0ac\uac74\uc758 \uc5f0\uc18d\uc73c\ub85c \ubcfc \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc758\ub8cc \uc0ac\uac74 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ubbf8\ub9ac \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc99d\uac70 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uace0 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud558\uc704 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4. 310\uac1c \uc758\ub8cc \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 3\uc5b5 \uac1c\uc758 \uace0\uc720 \ud658\uc790 \uae30\ub85d\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ube44\uc2dd\ubcc4 \uc7a5\uae30 \uac74\uac15 \uae30\ub85d\uc5d0\uc11c 163\uc5b5 \uac74\uc758 \uc758\ub8cc \uc0ac\uac74\uc774 \ud3ec\ud568\ub41c Epic Cosmos\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, 1150\uc5b5 \uac1c\uc758 \uc774\uc0b0 \uc758\ub8cc \uc0ac\uac74(1510\uc5b5 \uac1c\uc758 \ud1a0\ud070)\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\ub294 1\uc5b5 1800\ub9cc \uba85\uc758 \ud658\uc790\ub85c \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c CoMET \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc758\ub8cc \uc0ac\uac74 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac00\uc7a5 \ud070 \uaddc\ubaa8 \ubc95\uce59 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \ud655\ub9bd\ud558\uace0 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305, \ud1a0\ud070 \ubc0f \ubaa8\ub378 \ud06c\uae30\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud30c\uc6cc \ubc95\uce59\uc758 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ubc1d\ud78c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ucd5c\ub300 10\uc5b5 \uac1c\uc758 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \uc77c\ub828\uc758 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ucd5c\uc801 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.

However, while MCP brings notable benefits, it\nalso introduces significant vulnerabilities, such as Tool Poisoning Attacks\n(TPA), where hidden malicious instructions exploit the sycophancy of large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to manipulate agent behavior. Despite these risks,\ncurrent academic research on MCP security remains limited, with most studies\nfocusing on narrow or qualitative analyses that fail to capture the diversity\nof real-world threats. To address this gap, we present the MCP Attack Library\n(MCPLIB), which categorizes and implements 31 distinct attack methods under\nfour key classifications: direct tool injection, indirect tool injection,\nmalicious user attacks, and LLM inherent attack. We further conduct a\nquantitative analysis of the efficacy of each attack. Our experiments reveal\nkey insights into MCP vulnerabilities, including agents' blind reliance on tool\ndescriptions, sensitivity to file-based attacks, chain attacks exploiting\nshared context, and difficulty distinguishing external data from executable\ncommands. These insights, validated through attack experiments, underscore the\nurgency for robust defense strategies and informed MCP design. Our\ncontributions include 1) constructing a comprehensive MCP attack taxonomy, 2)\nintroducing a unified attack framework MCPLIB, and 3) conducting empirical\nvulnerability analysis to enhance MCP security mechanisms.

Traditional RCA methods often focus on\nsingle modalities or merely rank suspect services, falling short of providing\nactionable diagnostic insights with remediation guidance. This paper introduces\nGALA, a novel multi-modal framework that combines statistical causal inference\nwith LLM-driven iterative reasoning for enhanced RCA. Evaluated on an\nopen-source benchmark, GALA achieves substantial improvements over\nstate-of-the-art methods of up to 42.22% accuracy. Our novel human-guided LLM\nevaluation score shows GALA generates significantly more causally sound and\nactionable diagnostic outputs than existing methods. Through comprehensive\nexperiments and a case study, we show that GALA bridges the gap between\nautomated failure diagnosis and practical incident resolution by providing both\naccurate root cause identification and human-interpretable remediation\nguidance.", "AI": {"tldr": "GALA\ub294 \ubbf8\uc18c \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uadfc\ubcf8 \uc6d0\uc778 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 42.22% \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ubcf4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubbf8\uc18c \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uadfc\ubcf8 \uc6d0\uc778 \ubd84\uc11d\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud154\ub808\uba54\ud2b8\ub9ac\uc5d0\uc11c \ube60\ub978 \uc2e4\ud328 \uc9c4\ub2e8\uc744 \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \ub2e8\uc77c \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\uc5d0\ub9cc \uc9d1\uc911\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc758\uc2ec\uc2a4\ub7ec\uc6b4 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\ub97c \uc21c\uc704 \ub9e4\uae30\ub294 \uc218\uc900\uc5d0 \uadf8\uccd0 \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc9c4\ub2e8 \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "GALA\ub294 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \uc778\uacfc \ucd94\ub860\uacfc LLM \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "GALA\ub294 \uacf5\uac1c \uc18c\uc2a4 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ucd5c\ub300 42.22%\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub85c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "GALA\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uc2e4\ud328 \uc9c4\ub2e8\uacfc \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc0ac\uac74 \ud574\uacb0 \uac04\uc758 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \uc904\uc774\uba70, \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uadfc\ubcf8 \uc6d0\uc778 \uc2dd\ubcc4\uacfc \uc778\uac04\uc774 \ud574\uc11d\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc218\uc815 \uc9c0\uce68\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub9c8\uc774\ud06c\ub85c\uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uadfc\ubcf8 \uc6d0\uc778 \ubd84\uc11d(RCA)\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud154\ub808\uba54\ud2b8\ub9ac(\uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad, \ub85c\uadf8, \ud2b8\ub808\uc774\uc2a4 \ub4f1)\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2e4\ud328\ub97c \uc2e0\uc18d\ud558\uac8c \uc9c4\ub2e8\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ubbc0\ub85c \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 RCA \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \ub2e8\uc77c \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc758\uc2ec\uc2a4\ub7ec\uc6b4 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\ub97c \ub2e8\uc21c\ud788 \uc21c\uc704 \ub9e4\uae30\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc2e4\ud589\ub418\uc5b4, \uc2e4\uc81c\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc218\uc815 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc9c4\ub2e8 \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc2e4\ud328\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 GALA\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\ub294\ub370, \uc774\ub294 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \uc778\uacfc \ucd94\ub860\uacfc LLM \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec RCA\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacf5\uac1c \uc18c\uc2a4 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, GALA\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ucd5c\ub300 42.22%\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub85c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc778\uac04 \uc8fc\ub3c4 LLM \ud3c9\uac00 \uc810\uc218\uc5d0 \ub530\ub974\uba74 GALA\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc778\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub354 \ubbff\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\uace0 \uc218\uc815 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc9c4\ub2e8 \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc885\ud569\uc801\uc778 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uacfc \uc0ac\ub840 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 GALA\uac00 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uc2e4\ud328 \uc9c4\ub2e8\uacfc \uc2e4\uc81c \uc0ac\uac74 \ud574\uacb0 \uac04\uc758 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \uc904\uc774\uba74\uc11c, \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uadfc\ubcf8 \uc6d0\uc778 \uc2dd\ubcc4\uacfc \uc778\uac04\uc774 \ud574\uc11d\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc218\uc815 \uc9c0\uce68\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc904 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

To address this, we propose DynamixSFT, a dynamic\nand automated method for instruction-tuning dataset mixture optimization. We\nformulate the problem as a multi-armed bandit setup and introduce a\nPrior-scaled Boltzmann Exploration that softly anchors the updated sampling\ndistribution to the original dataset proportions, thereby preserving the\ninherent diversity and coverage of the collection. Sampling probabilities are\nupdated using a lightweight 1-Step Look-ahead Reward, reflecting how much the\ndataset contributes to improving the model's performance at its current state.\nWhen applied to the Tulu-v2-mixture collection comprising 16 instruction-tuning\ndatasets, DynamixSFT achieves up to a 2.2% performance improvement across 10\nbenchmarks.

Nevertheless, it remains\nunclear to what extent the prevailing assumptions and proposed solutions are\nvalid and how significant CPL is in real-world data. To address this gap, we\nfirst perform a comprehensive statistical analysis of five widely used LDP\nmechanisms -- GRR, RAPPOR, OUE, OLH and Exponential mechanism -- to assess CPL\nacross four real-world datasets. We identify that many primary assumptions and\nmetrics in current approaches fall short of accurately characterising these\nleakages. Moreover, current studies have been limited to a set of pure LDP\n(i.e., {\\delta = 0}) mechanisms. In response, we develop the first algorithmic\nframework to theoretically quantify CPL for any general approximated LDP\n(({\\varepsilon},{\\delta})-LDP) mechanism. We validate our theoretical results\nagainst empirical statistical results and provide a theoretical explanation for\nthe observed statistical patterns. Finally, we propose two novel benchmarks to\nvalidate correlation analysis algorithms and evaluate the utility vs CPL of LDP\nmechanisms. Further, we demonstrate how these findings can be applied to\nachieve an efficient privacy-utility trade-off in real-world data governance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc9c0\uc5ed

This effect arises from the coupling between\nstate-space time scales--parametrized by the gates--and parameter-space\ndynamics during gradient descent. By deriving exact Jacobians for\nleaky-integrator and gated RNNs, we obtain a first-order expansion that makes\nexplicit how constant, scalar, and multi-dimensional gates reshape gradient\npropagation, modulate effective step sizes, and introduce anisotropy in\nparameter updates. These findings reveal that gates not only control memory\nretention in the hidden states, but also act as data-driven preconditioners\nthat adapt optimization trajectories in parameter space. We further draw formal\nanalogies with learning-rate schedules, momentum, and adaptive methods such as\nAdam, showing that these optimization behaviors emerge naturally from gating.\nNumerical experiments confirm the validity of our perturbative analysis,\nsupporting the view that gate-induced corrections remain small while exerting\nsystematic effects on training dynamics. Overall, this work provides a unified\ndynamical-systems perspective on how gating couples state evolution with\nparameter updates, explaining why gated architectures achieve robust\ntrainability and stability in practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc21c\ud658 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(RNN)\uc758 \uac8c\uc774\ud305 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774 \uace0\uc815\ub41c

Our research highlights the limitations of current\nsolutions in detecting obfuscation, correlating attacks, identifying\nlow-frequency events, and ensuring robust context awareness in relation to\ncommand-line activities. To address these challenges, we introduce DEFENDCLI,\nan innovative system leveraging provenance graphs that, for the first time,\ndelves into command-line-level detection. By offering finer detection\ngranularity, it addresses a gap in modern EDR systems that has been overlooked\nin previous research. Our solution improves the precision of the information\nrepresentation by evaluating differentiation across three levels: unusual\nsystem process calls, suspicious command-line executions, and infrequent\nexternal network connections. This multi-level approach enables EDR systems to\nbe more reliable in complex and dynamic environments. Our evaluation\ndemonstrates that DEFENDCLI improves precision by approximately 1.6x compared\nto the state-of-the-art methods on the DARPA Engagement Series attack datasets.\nExtensive real-time industrial testing across various attack scenarios further\nvalidates its practical effectiveness. The results indicate that DEFENDCLI not\nonly detects previously unknown attack instances, which are missed by other\nmodern commercial solutions, but also achieves a 2.3x improvement in

The FOFPID\ncontroller combines fuzzy logic for adapting to changes and fractional order\ndynamics for fine tuning. This allows it to adjust its control gains to handle\na person's unique physiology. The WOA helps fine tune the controller's\nparameters, including the fractional orders and the fuzzy membership functions,\nwhich boosts its performance. Tested on models of eight different patient\nprofiles, the FOFPID controller performed better than a standard Fractional\nOrder PID (FOPID) controller. It achieved faster settling times, at two and a\nhalf minutes versus three point two minutes, and had a lower steady state\nerror, at zero point five versus one point two. These outcomes show the\nFOFPID's excellent strength and accuracy.

Parametric projections make it\npossible to embed new, unseen samples without recalculating the entire\nprojection, while invertible projections allow the synthesis of new data\ninstances. However, existing methods perform poorly when dealing with\nout-of-distribution samples in either the data or embedding space. Thus, we\npropose DE-VAE, an uncertainty-aware variational AE using differential entropy\n(DE) to improve the learned parametric and invertible projections. Given a\nfixed projection, we train DE-VAE to learn a mapping into 2D space and an\ninverse mapping back to the original space. We conduct quantitative and\nqualitative evaluations on four well-known datasets, using UMAP and t-SNE as\nbaseline projection methods.

The proposed approach\naddresses key limitations in adapting existing trust bootstrapping approaches\ninto MEC-based IIoT systems. These key limitations include, the lack of\nopportunity for a service consumer to interact with a lesser-known service over\na prolonged period of time to get a robust measure of its trustworthiness,\ninability of service consumers to consistently interact with their peers to\nreceive reliable recommendations of the trustworthiness of a lesser-known\nservice as well as the impact of uneven context parameters in different MEC\nenvironments causing uneven trust environments for trust evaluation.

A critical research gap lies in\nidentifying the underlying causes of hydrogen bond formation and separation\n-understanding which interactions or prior events contribute to their emergence\nover time. With this challenge in mind, we propose leveraging spatio-temporal\ndata analytics and machine learning models to enhance the detection of these\nphenomena. In this paper, our approach is inspired by causal modeling and aims\nto identify the root cause variables of hydrogen bond formation and separation\nevents. Specifically, we treat the separation of hydrogen bonds as an\n\"intervention\" occurring and represent the causal structure of the bonding and\nseparation events in the MDS as graphical causal models. These causal models\nare built using a variational autoencoder-inspired architecture that enables us\nto infer causal relationships across samples with diverse underlying causal\ngraphs while leveraging shared dynamic information. We further include a step\nto infer the root causes of changes in the joint distribution of the causal\nmodels. By constructing causal models that capture shifts in the conditional\ndistributions of molecular interactions during bond formation or separation,\nthis framework provides a novel perspective on root cause analysis in molecular\ndynamic systems. We validate the efficacy of our model empirically on the\natomic trajectories that used MDS for chiral separation, demonstrating that we\ncan predict many steps in the future and also find the variables driving the\nobserved changes in the system.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ubd84\uc790 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c \uc218\uc18c \uacb0\ud569

This work proposes a novel deep learning (DL)\narchitecture called the attention-integrated convolutional residual network\n(AICRN) to regress key ECG parameters such as the PR interval, the QT interval,\nthe QRS duration, the heart rate, the peak amplitude of the R wave, and the\namplitude of the T wave for interpretable ECG analysis. Our architecture is\nspecially designed with spatial and channel attention-related mechanisms to\naddress the type and spatial location of the ECG features for regression. The\nmodels employ a convolutional residual network to address vanishing and\nexploding gradient problems. The designed system addresses traditional analysis\nchallenges, such as loss of focus due to human errors, and facilitates the fast\nand easy detection of cardiac events, thereby reducing the manual efforts\nrequired to solve analysis tasks. AICRN models outperform existing models in\nparameter regression with higher precision. This work demonstrates that DL can\nplay a crucial role in the interpretability and precision of ECG analysis,\nopening up new clinical applications for cardiac monitoring and management.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5\uacfc \uba38\uc2e0\ub7ec\ub2dd\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uc2ec\uc804\ub3c4 \ubd84\uc11d\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud574\uc84c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc2ec\uc804\ub3c4 \ubd84\uc11d\uc758 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uacfc \uc815\ubc00\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc778 AICRN\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "AICRN\uc740 PR \uac04\uaca9, QT \uac04\uaca9, QRS \uc9c0\uc18d\uc2dc\uac04, \uc2ec\ubc15\uc218, R\ud30c\uc758 \ud53c\ud06c \uc9c4\ud3ed, T\ud30c\uc758 \uc9c4\ud3ed\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc2ec\uc804\ub3c4 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \ud68c\uadc0 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uacf5\uac04\uc801 \ubc0f \ucc44\ub110 \uc8fc\uc758 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc124\uacc4\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "result": "AICRN \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uae30\uc874 \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \ud68c\uadc0\uc5d0\uc11c \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uae30\ub85d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd\uc774 \uc2ec\uc804\ub3c4 \ubd84\uc11d\uc758 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uacfc \uc815\ubc00\uc131\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uc2ec\uc7a5 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1 \ubc0f \uad00\ub9ac\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc784\uc0c1 \uc751\uc6a9\uc744 \uc5f4\uc5b4\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc2ec\uc804\ub3c4(ECG) \ubd84\uc11d\uc758 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc740 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5(AI)\uacfc \uba38\uc2e0\ub7ec\ub2dd(ML)\uc758 \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc73c\ub85c \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \ubd84\uc11d\uc73c\ub85c \ubc1c\uc804\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc2ec\uc7a5 \uc9c8\ud658\uc758 \uc9c4\ub2e8 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc640 \uc608\uce21 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf30\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc2ec\uc804\ub3c4 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc704\ud574 PR \uac04\uaca9, QT \uac04\uaca9, QRS \uc9c0\uc18d\uc2dc\uac04, \uc2ec\ubc15\uc218, R\ud30c\uc758 \ud53c\ud06c \uc9c4\ud3ed, T\ud30c\uc758 \uc9c4\ud3ed\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc8fc\uc694 ECG \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \ud68c\uadc0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd(DL) \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc778 \uc8fc\uc758 \uc9d1\ud569 \ucee8\ubcfc\ub8e8\uc158 \uc794\ucc28 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c(AICRN)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub294 \ud68c\uadc0\ub97c \uc704\ud55c ECG \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc758 \uc720\ud615\uacfc \uacf5\uac04\uc801 \uc704\uce58\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uacf5\uac04\uc801 \ubc0f \ucc44\ub110 \uc8fc\uc758 \uad00\ub828 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc73c\ub85c \ud2b9\ubcc4\ud788 \uc124\uacc4\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uc740 \uc0ac\ub77c\uc9c0\ub294 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8\uc640 \ud3ed\ubc1c\ud558\ub294 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ucee8\ubcfc\ub8e8\uc158 \uc794\ucc28 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ucc44\ud0dd\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc778\uac04 \uc624\ub958\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uc8fc\uc758\ub825 \uc190\uc2e4\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ubd84\uc11d \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0 \uc2ec\uc7a5 \uc0ac\uac74\uc758 \ube60\ub974\uace0 \uc26c\uc6b4 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub97c \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\uc5ec \ubd84\uc11d \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc218\uc791\uc5c5 \ub178\ub825\uc744 \uc904\uc778\ub2e4.

While this design enables unified modeling of multimodal\nprotein information, it suffers from two major limitations: (1) The\nconcatenation of sequence and structure tokens approximately doubles the\nprotein length and breaks the intrinsic residue-level alignment between\nmodalities. (2) Constrained by the training corpus and limited context window,\nProtTeX is typically trained on single-protein inputs, rendering it\nincompatible with in-context learning (ICL) and thus limiting its\ngeneralization capability. To address these issues, we propose ProtTeX-CC, a\nlightweight two-stage compression framework designed to enhance ProtTeX under\nfew-shot settings. We first design a joint embedding compression mechanism that\nfuses sequence and structure representations at the residue level, effectively\nreducing the protein input length by half without sacrificing performance. Then\nwe propose a self-compression module that aggregates each full demonstration\ninto the latent space of the last few linguistic tokens, reducing the average\ndemonstration length from 751 tokens to less than 16 tokens. Compared to the\noriginal ProtTeX, our self-compression approach achieves a compression ratio of\napproximately 93.68% in the total prompt length under the 16-shot setting.\nWithout modifying the backbone model, ProtTeX-CC introduces only a small number\nof additional parameters through PEFT-based tuning in the joint embedding\ncompression stage and a single trainable projection layer in the\nself-compression stage.

This paper introduces a\nvalidation-driven methodology that integrates active behavioral testing in\ncloud security posture management solution(s) to evaluate the exploitability of\npolicy violations in real time. The proposed system employs lightweight and\nautomated probes, built from open-source tools, validation scripts, and\npenetration testing test cases, to simulate adversarial attacks on\nmisconfigured or vulnerable cloud assets without any impact to the cloud\nservices or environment. For instance, cloud services may be flagged as\npublicly exposed and vulnerable despite being protected by access control\nlayers, or secure policies, resulting in non-actionable alerts that consumes\nanalysts time during manual validation. Through controlled experimentation in a\nreproducible AWS setup, we evaluated the reduction in false positive rates\nacross various misconfiguration and vulnerable alerts. Our findings indicate an\naverage reduction of 93\\% in false positives. Furthermore, the framework\ndemonstrates low latency performance. These results demonstrate a scalable\nmethod to improve detection accuracy and analyst productivity in large cloud\nenvironments. While our evaluation focuses on AWS, the architecture is modular\nand extensible to multi-cloud setups.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc \ubcf4\uc548 \ud0dc\uc138

Traditional machine-learning based approaches to\nperforming this task require a large corpus of annotated data and lack the\nability to easily incorporate domain specific information in the construction\nof the model. Therefore, creating a model for JERE is often labor intensive,\ntime consuming, and elaboration intolerant. In this paper, we propose\nharnessing the capabilities of generative pretrained large language models\n(LLMs) and the knowledge representation and reasoning capabilities of Answer\nSet Programming (ASP) to perform JERE. We present a generic workflow for JERE\nusing LLMs and ASP. The workflow is generic in the sense that it can be applied\nfor JERE in any domain. It takes advantage of LLM's capability in natural\nlanguage understanding in that it works directly with unannotated text. It\nexploits the elaboration tolerant feature of ASP in that no modification of its\ncore program is required when additional domain specific knowledge, in the form\nof type specifications, is found and needs to be used. We demonstrate the\nusefulness of the proposed workflow through experiments with limited training\ndata on three well-known benchmarks for JERE. The results of our experiments\nshow that the LLM + ASP workflow is better than state-of-the-art JERE systems\nin several categories with only 10\\% of training data.

Our approach treats\ntraining as a deterministic program and logs a minimal per-microbatch record\n(ordered ID hash, RNG seed, learning-rate value, optimizer-step counter, and\naccumulation boundary). Under a pinned stack and deterministic kernels,\nreplaying the training tail while filtering only the forget closure yields the\nsame parameters as training on the retain set (bit-identical in the training\ndtype) when preconditions hold. To meet latency and availability constraints,\nwe add complementary paths: (i) exact reverts of recent steps via\nmicro-checkpoints or dense per-step deltas, (ii) cohort-scoped adapter deletion\nwhen the base is frozen, and (iii) a curvature-guided anti-update followed by a\nshort retain-tune, audit-gated with escalation to exact replay.

In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic\nknowledge distillation (KD)-enabled wireless radio frequency fingerprint large\nlanguage model (RFF-LLM) framework for UAV ID identification. First, we propose\nan RFF-LLM framework based on the modified GPT-2 model to improve the\nidentification accuracy in complex outdoor environments. Then, considering the\nparameter overhead of the RFF-LLM, we design a dynamic KD strategy to compress\nthe model. Specifically, the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm is\nemployed to dynamically adjust the distillation temperature, overcoming the\nlocal optimum dilemma inherent in static KD. As a next step, the knowledge of\nthe RFF-LLM is adequately transferred to the lightweight Lite-HRNet model.\nFinally, our experiments are conducted based on the self-built drone RFF\ndataset of Release one, namely DRFF-R1, by collecting the I/Q signals of 20\ncommercial UAVs in channel 149.

However, cognitive structure assessment remains a\nlong-standing challenge in student modeling and psychometrics, persisting as a\nfoundational yet largely unassessable concept in educational practice. This\npaper introduces a novel framework, Cognitive Structure Generation (CSG), in\nwhich we first pretrain a Cognitive Structure Diffusion Probabilistic Model\n(CSDPM) to generate students' cognitive structures from educational priors, and\nthen further optimize its generative process as a policy with hierarchical\nreward signals via reinforcement learning to align with genuine cognitive\ndevelopment levels during students' learning processes. Experimental results on\nfour popular real-world education datasets show that cognitive structures\ngenerated by CSG offer more comprehensive and effective representations for\nstudent modeling, substantially improving performance on KT and CD tasks while\nenhancing interpretability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud559\uc0dd\uc758 \uc778\uc9c0 \uad6c\uc870 \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 \uc778\uc9c0 \uad6c\uc870 \uc0dd\uc131(CSG)\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud559\uc0dd\uc758 \uc778\uc9c0 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud559\uc0dd \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \ubc0f \uc2ec\ub9ac\uce21\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uc9c0 \uad6c\uc870 \ud3c9\uac00\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uacfc \uadf8 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc778\uc9c0 \uad6c\uc870 \ud655\uc0b0 \ud655\ub960 \ubaa8\ub378(CSDPM)\uc744 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\uc5ec \uad50\uc721\uc801 \uc120\ud5d8\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ud559\uc0dd\uc758 \uc778\uc9c0 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc815\ucc45\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc CSG\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \uc778\uc9c0 \uad6c\uc870\uac00 \ud559\uc0dd \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc5d0 \ub354 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, KT \ubc0f CD \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b4\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "CSG\uac00 \ud559\uc0dd\uc758 \uc9c4\uc815\ud55c \uc778\uc9c0 \ubc1c\ub2ec \uc218\uc900\uacfc \uc77c\uce58\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ub3d5\uace0 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud568\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc778\uc9c0 \uad6c\uc870\ub294 \ud559\uc0dd\uc758 \uac1d\uad00\uc801 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc8fc\uad00\uc801 \uc870\uc9c1\uc73c\ub85c, \uac1c\ub150\uacfc \uadf8 \uad00\uacc4\uc758 \uc2ec\ub9ac\uc801 \uad6c\uc131\uc5d0 \ubc18\uc601\ub41c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc778\uc9c0 \uad6c\uc870 \ud3c9\uac00\ub294 \ud559\uc0dd \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \ubc0f \uc2ec\ub9ac\uce21\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc624\ub7ab\ub3d9\uc548 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uad50\uc721 \uc2e4\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc \uac70\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \uac1c\ub150\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c0\uc18d\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc778\uc9c0 \uad6c\uc870 \uc0dd\uc131(CSG)\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \uba3c\uc800 \ud559\uc0dd\uc758 \uc778\uc9c0 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uad50\uc721\uc801 \uc120\ud5d8\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc778\uc9c0 \uad6c\uc870 \ud655\uc0b0 \ud655\ub960 \ubaa8\ub378(CSDPM)\uc744 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ud6c4 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc9c4\uc815\ud55c \uc778\uc9c0 \ubc1c\ub2ec \uc218\uc900\uc5d0 \ub9de\uac8c \uc0dd\uc131 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uc815\ucc45\uc73c\ub85c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub124 \uac1c\uc758 \uc778\uae30 \uc788\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \uad50\uc721 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, CSG\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \uc778\uc9c0 \uad6c\uc870\uac00 \ud559\uc0dd \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub354 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, KT \ubc0f CD \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4."}}

Existing planning frameworks remain\ninadequate for this complexity due to historical limitations in data\ngranularity and real-world applicability. This paper addresses these gaps by\nfirst proposing the Capacitated Dynamic Maximum Covering Location Problem\n(CDMCLP), a novel optimization framework that simultaneously models urban-scale\nspatial-temporal demand, heterogeneous user behaviors, and infrastructure\ncapacity constraints. Building on this foundation, we introduce an Integrated\nPlanning Recommendation System that combines CDMCLP with socio-economic factors\nand dynamic clustering initialization. This system leverages adaptive parameter\ntuning based on empirical user behavior to generate practical planning\nsolutions. Validation in a Chinese center city demonstrates the effectiveness\nof the new optimization framework and recommendation system. Under the\nevaluation and optimization of CDMCLP, the quantitative performance of\ntraditional location methods are exposed and can be improved by 38\\%--52\\%,\nwhile the recommendation system shows user-friendliness and the effective\nintegration of complex elements. By integrating mathematical rigor with\npractical implementation considerations, this hybrid approach bridges the gap\nbetween theoretical location modeling and real-world UAM infrastructure\nplanning, offering municipalities a pragmatic tool for vertiport network\ndesign.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub3c4\uc2dc \ud56d\uacf5 \uc774\ub3d9\uc131(UAM) \uc778\ud504\ub77c \uac1c\ubc1c\uc774 \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ub428\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub3c4\uc2dc \uaddc\ubaa8\uc758 \uacf5\uac04-\uc2dc\uac04 \uc218\uc694, \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ud589\ub3d9 \ubc0f \uc778\ud504\ub77c \uc6a9\ub7c9 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 CDMCLP\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uacc4\ud68d \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 \ub3c4\uc2dc \ud56d\uacf5 \uc774\ub3d9\uc131 \uc778\ud504\ub77c\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8e8\uae30\uc5d0\ub294 \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ubd84\ud654 \ubc0f \uc2e4\uc138\uacc4 \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ubd88\ucda9\ubd84\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "CDMCLP\ub77c\ub294 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \uc0ac\ud68c-\uacbd\uc81c\uc801 \uc694\uc778 \ubc0f \ub3d9\uc801 \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130\ub9c1 \ucd08\uae30\ud654\uc640 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569 \uacc4\ud68d \ucd94\ucc9c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc911\uad6d\uc758 \uc911\uc2ec \ub3c4\uc2dc\uc5d0\uc11c \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uc5ec \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc640 \ucd94\ucc9c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uace0, \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc704\uce58 \uc120\uc815 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 38%-52% \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubc1d\ud614\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc218\ud559\uc801 \uc5c4\ubc00\uc131\uacfc \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801 \uad6c\ud604 \uace0\ub824 \uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc774 \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc704\uce58 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uacfc \uc2e4\uc81c UAM \uc778\ud504\ub77c \uacc4\ud68d \uac04\uc758 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\uc5ec \uc9c0\ubc29 \uc790\uce58 \ub2e8\uccb4\uc5d0 vertiport \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub3c4\uc2dc \ud56d\uacf5 \uc774\ub3d9\uc131(UAM) \uc778\ud504\ub77c \uac1c\ubc1c\uc774 \uc804\uc138\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ub428\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \uc2ec\ucc9c\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ub3c4\uc2dc\ub4e4\uc740 2026\ub144\uae4c\uc9c0 1,200\uac1c \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uc2dc\uc124\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ubc84\ud2f0\ud3ec\ud2b8 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uacc4\ud68d\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uacc4\ud68d \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ubd84\ud654 \ubc0f \uc2e4\uc81c \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc758 \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801 \ud55c\uacc4\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8e8\uae30\uc5d0 \ubd88\ucda9\ubd84\ud558\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub3c4\uc2dc \uaddc\ubaa8\uc758 \uacf5\uac04-\uc2dc\uac04 \uc218\uc694, \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ud589\ub3d9 \ubc0f \uc778\ud504\ub77c \uc6a9\ub7c9 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 \uc6a9\ub7c9 \uc81c\uc57d \ub3d9\uc801 \ucd5c\ub300 \ucee4\ubc84\ub9c1 \uc704\uce58 \ubb38\uc81c(CDMCLP)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uac04\uadf9\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uae30\ubc18 \uc704\uc5d0, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 CDMCLP\ub97c \uc0ac\ud68c-\uacbd\uc81c\uc801 \uc694\uc778 \ubc0f \ub3d9\uc801 \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130\ub9c1 \ucd08\uae30\ud654\uc640 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569 \uacc4\ud68d \ucd94\ucc9c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uacc4\ud68d \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc911\uad6d\uc758 \uc911\uc2ec \ub3c4\uc2dc\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc640 \ucd94\ucc9c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.

However, existing models are not explicitly designed to detect the\ndiverse patterns of off-chain cryptocurrency money laundering. Neglecting any\nlaundering pattern introduces critical detection gaps, as each pattern reflects\nunique transactional structures that facilitate the obfuscation of illicit fund\norigins and movements. Failure to account for these patterns may result in\nunder-detection or omission of specific laundering activities, diminishing\nmodel accuracy and allowing schemes to bypass detection. To address this gap,\nwe propose the MPOCryptoML model to effectively detect multiple laundering\npatterns in cryptocurrency transactions. MPOCryptoML includes the development\nof a multi-source Personalized PageRank algorithm to identify random laundering\npatterns. Additionally, we introduce two novel algorithms by analyzing the\ntimestamp and weight of transactions in high-volume financial networks to\ndetect various money laundering structures, including fan-in, fan-out,\nbipartite, gather-scatter, and stack patterns. We further examine correlations\nbetween these patterns using a logistic regression model. An anomaly score\nfunction integrates results from each module to rank accounts by anomaly score,\nsystematically identifying high-risk accounts. Extensive experiments on public\ndatasets including Elliptic++, Ethereum fraud detection, and Wormhole\ntransaction datasets validate the efficacy and efficiency of MPOCryptoML.\nResults show consistent performance gains, with improvements up to 9.13% in\nprecision, up to 10.16% in recall, up to 7.63% in F1-score, and up to 10.19% in\naccuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc554\ud638\ud654\ud3d0 \uac70\ub798\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc138\ud0c1 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 MPOCryptoML \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc554\ud638\ud654\ud3d0 \uc790\uae08 \uc138\ud0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc624\ud504\uccb4\uc778 \uc790\uae08 \uc138\ud0c1 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc124\uacc4\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "MPOCryptoML \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc18c\uc2a4\uc758 \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c \ud398\uc774\uc9c0\ub7ad\ud06c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc5ec \uc784\uc758\uc758 \uc138\ud0c1 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uba70, \uac70\ub798\uc758 \ud0c0\uc784\uc2a4\ud0ec\ud504\uc640 \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc138\ud0c1 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "MPOCryptoML\uc740 \ub9ce\uc740 \uacf5\uacf5 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4, \uc7ac\ud604\uc728, F1 \uc810\uc218, \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc5d0\uc11c \uac1c\uc120\ub41c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "MPOCryptoML\uc740 \uc790\uae08 \uc138\ud0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uba70, \uc704\ud5d8 \uacc4\uc815\uc744 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac00\uc9d1\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc\uc758 \uc790\uae08 \uc138\ud0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc138\ud0c1 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc624\ud504\uccb4\uc778 \uc554\ud638\ud654\ud3d0 \uc790\uae08 \uc138\ud0c1\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc124\uacc4\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5b4\ub5a4 \uc138\ud0c1 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \uac04\uacfc\ud558\uba74 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc138\ud0c1 \ud65c\ub3d9\uc744 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uac8c \ub418\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uac00 \uac10\uc18c\ud558\uace0 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub97c \uc6b0\ud68c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc554\ud638\ud654\ud3d0 \uac70\ub798\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc138\ud0c1 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 MPOCryptoML \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, current PLM-based TSF methods still fail to achieve\nsatisfactory prediction accuracy matching the strong sequential modeling power\nof language models. To address this issue, we propose Cross-Model and\nCross-Modality Learning with PLMs for time series forecasting (CC-Time). We\nexplore the potential of PLMs for time series forecasting from two aspects: 1)\nwhat time series features could be modeled by PLMs, and 2) whether relying\nsolely on PLMs is sufficient for building time series models. In the first\naspect, CC-Time incorporates cross-modality learning to model temporal\ndependency and channel correlations in the language model from both time series\nsequences and their corresponding text descriptions. In the second aspect,\nCC-Time further proposes the cross-model fusion block to adaptively integrate\nknowledge from the PLMs and time series model to form a more comprehensive\nmodeling of time series patterns.

Yet, we\nobserve that researchers in this rapidly emerging field face challenges in\nanalyzing and understanding the behavior of different MU methods, especially in\nterms of three fundamental principles in MU: accuracy, efficiency, and privacy.\nConsequently, they often rely on aggregate metrics and ad-hoc evaluations,\nmaking it difficult to accurately assess the trade-offs between methods. To\nfill this gap, we introduce a visual analytics system, Unlearning Comparator,\ndesigned to facilitate the systematic evaluation of MU methods. Our system\nsupports two important tasks in the evaluation process: model comparison and\nattack simulation. First, it allows the user to compare the behaviors of two\nmodels, such as a model generated by a certain method and a retrained baseline,\nat class-, instance-, and layer-levels to better understand the changes made\nafter unlearning. Second, our system simulates membership inference attacks\n(MIAs) to evaluate the privacy of a method, where an attacker attempts to\ndetermine whether specific data samples were part of the original training set.\nWe evaluate our system through a case study visually analyzing prominent MU\nmethods and demonstrate that it helps the user not only understand model\nbehaviors but also gain insights

To tackle this,\nhypergraph neural networks (HNNs), the dominant approach in deep hypergraph\nlearning (DHGL), has garnered substantial attention in recent years. Despite\nthe proposal of numerous HNN methods, there is no comprehensive benchmark for\nHNNs, which creates a great obstacle to understanding the progress of DHGL in\nseveral aspects: (i) insufficient coverage of datasets, algorithms, and tasks;\n(ii) a narrow evaluation of algorithm performance; and (iii) inconsistent\ndataset usage, preprocessing, and experimental setups that hinder\ncomparability. To fill the gap, we introduce DHG-Bench, the first comprehensive\nbenchmark for DHGL. Specifically, DHG-Bench integrates 20 diverse datasets\nspanning node-, edge-, and graph-level tasks, along with 16 state-of-the-art\nHNN algorithms, under consistent data processing and experimental protocols.\nOur benchmark systematically investigates the characteristics of HNNs in terms\nof four dimensions: effectiveness, efficiency, robustness, and fairness.\nFurther, to facilitate reproducible research, we have developed an easy-to-use\nlibrary for training and evaluating different HNN methods. Extensive\nexperiments conducted with DHG-Bench reveal both the strengths and inherent\nlimitations of existing algorithms, offering valuable insights and directions\nfor future research.

Existing CNN privacy-preserving schemes, while\neffective in ensuring data confidentiality through homomorphic encryption and\nsecret sharing, face efficiency bottlenecks, particularly in convolution\noperations. In this paper, we propose a novel verifiable privacy-preserving\nscheme tailored for CNN convolutional layers. Our scheme enables efficient\nencryption and decryption, allowing resource-constrained clients to securely\noffload computations to the untrusted cloud server. Additionally, we present a\nverification mechanism capable of detecting the correctness of the results with\na success probability of at least $1-\\frac{1}{\\left|Z\\right|}$.

Since tool dependencies are often incomplete, it becomes challenging\nfor LLMs to accurately identify the appropriate tools required by a user\nrequest, especially when confronted with a large toolset. To solve this\nchallenge, we propose \\texttt{GTool}, which is the first work aiming to enhance\nthe tool planning ability of LLMs under incomplete dependencies. \\texttt{GTool}\nconstructs a request-specific tool graph to select tools efficiently and\ngenerate the \\texttt{<graph token>} which provides sufficient dependency\ninformation understandable by LLMs. Moreover, a missing dependency prediction\ntask is designed to improve the reliability of \\texttt{GTool} with incomplete\ndependencies. Without trimming LLMs, \\texttt{GTool} can be seamlessly\nintegrated with various LLM backbones without extensive retraining. Extensive\nexperiments show that \\texttt{GTool} achieves more than 29.6\\% performance\nimprovements compared with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines with a\nlight-weight (7B) LLM backbone.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ubd88\uc644\uc804\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c \uc758\uc874\uc131 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ub3c4\uad6c \uacc4\ud68d \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ucd5c\ucd08\ub85c \uc81c\uc548\ub41c GTool\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc120\ud0dd \ubc0f \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ud1a0\ud070 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub4e4\uc740 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uace0\ub9bd\ub41c \uad6c\uc131\uc694\uc18c\ub85c \ucde8\uae09\ud558\uba70, \ub3c4\uad6c \uac04\uc758 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud574 \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \uacc4\ud68d \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "GTool\uc740 \uc694\uccad\uc5d0 \ud2b9\uc815\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\uace0 LLM\uc774 \uc774\ud574\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ucda9\ubd84\ud55c \uc758\uc874\uc131 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 <graph token>\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "GTool\uc740 \uacbd\ub7c9 LLM \ubc31\ubcf8(7B)\uacfc \ud568\uaed8 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uae30\uc220(SOTA) \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 29.6% \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "GTool\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c LLM \ubc31\ubcf8\uacfc \ud1b5\ud569\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc7ac\ud6c8\ub828 \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 \ubd88\uc644\uc804\ud55c \uc758\uc874\uc131 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c \uacc4\ud68d\uc740 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc694\uccad\uc744 \uc644\ub8cc\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\uace0 \uc870\uc9c1\ud558\uba70 \uc900\ube44\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc758\ubbf8\ud558\uba70, \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uc774\ud574\uc640 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc2e4\ud589 \uc0ac\uc774\uc758 \uac04\uadf9\uc744 \uba54\uc6c1\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uace0\ub9bd\ub41c \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub85c \ucde8\uae09\ud558\uace0 \ub3c4\uad6c \uac04\uc758 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud574 \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \uacc4\ud68d \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub3c4\uad6c \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc774 \uc885\uc885 \ubd88\uc644\uc804\ud558\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 LLM\uc774 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc694\uccad\uc5d0 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc801\uc808\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uc815\ud655\ud788 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6cc\uc9c0\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud588\uc744 \ub54c \ud2b9\ud788 \uadf8\ub807\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubd88\uc644\uc804\ud55c \uc758\uc874\uc131 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c LLM\uc758 \ub3c4\uad6c \uacc4\ud68d \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ucd5c\ucd08\ub85c \texttt{GTool}\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \texttt{GTool}\uc740 \uc694\uccad \ud2b9\ud654 \ub3c4\uad6c \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\uace0 LLM\uc774 \uc774\ud574\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ucda9\ubd84\ud55c \uc758\uc874\uc131 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \texttt{<graph token>}\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \ub204\ub77d\ub41c \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5\uc774 \uc124\uacc4\ub418\uc5b4 \ubd88\uc644\uc804\ud55c \uc758\uc874\uc131 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \texttt{GTool}\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Although considerable\neffort has been dedicated to aligning LLMs with human moral values, existing\nbenchmarks and evaluations remain largely superficial, typically measuring\nalignment based on final ethical verdicts rather than explicit moral reasoning.\nIn response, this paper aims to advance the investigation of LLMs' moral\ncapabilities by examining their capacity to function as Artificial Moral\nAssistants (AMAs), systems envisioned in the philosophical literature to\nsupport human moral deliberation. We assert that qualifying as an AMA requires\nmore than what state-of-the-art alignment techniques aim to achieve: not only\nmust AMAs be able to discern ethically problematic situations, they should also\nbe able to actively reason about them, navigating between conflicting values\noutside of those embedded in the alignment phase. Building on existing\nphilosophical literature, we begin by designing a new formal framework of the\nspecific kind of behaviour an AMA should exhibit, individuating key qualities\nsuch as deductive and abductive moral reasoning. Drawing on this theoretical\nframework, we develop a benchmark to test these qualities and evaluate popular\nopen LLMs against it. Our results reveal considerable variability across models\nand highlight persistent shortcomings, particularly regarding abductive moral\nreasoning. Our work connects theoretical philosophy with practical AI\nevaluation while also emphasising the need for dedicated strategies to\nexplicitly enhance moral reasoning capabilities in LLMs. Code available at\nhttps://github.com/alessioGalatolo/AMAeval", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ub3c4\ub355\uc801 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\uba70, \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \ub3c4\ub355 \ubcf4\uc870\uad00\uc73c\ub85c\uc11c \uae30\ub2a5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ub3c4\ub355\uc801 \ub2a5\ub825\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc6b0\ub824\uc640 \uae30\uc874 \ud3c9\uac00\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud568\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub3c4\ub355\uc801 \uc0ac\uace0\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \ub3c4\ub355 \ubcf4\uc870\uad00(AMA)\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc815\uc758\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ubaa8\ub378 \uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uacfc \ud2b9\ud788 \ub3c4\ub355\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc758 \ubd80\uc871\ud568\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ucca0\ud559\uc801 \uc774\ub860\uacfc \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc801 AI \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\uba70 LLM\uc758 \ub3c4\ub355\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825 \uac15\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc804\ub7b5\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud568\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \uc778\uae30\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc6b0\ub824\uac00 \ucee4\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Such constrained, vulnerable minorities are often worried about\ninadvertent information disclosure and may be unsure about the extent to which\ntheir communications are being monitored in public or semi-public spaces like\nworkplaces or cafes. Personal devices extend trust to the digital domain,\nmaking it desirable to have strictly private communication between trusted\ndevices. Currently, messaging services like WhatsApp provide alternative means\nfor exchanging sensitive private information, while personal safety apps such\nas Noonlight enable private signaling. However, these rely on third-party\nmechanisms for secure and private communication, which may not be accessible\nfor justifiable reasons, such as insecure internet access or companion device\nconnections. In these cases, it is challenging to achieve communication that is\nstrictly private between two devices instead of user accounts without any\ndependency on third-party infrastructure. The goal of this paper is to support\nprivate communications by setting up a shared secret between two or more\ndevices without sending any data on the network. We develop a method to create\na shared secret between phones by shaking them together. Each device extracts\nthe shared randomness from the shake, then conditions the randomness to 7.798\nbits per byte of key material. This paper proposes three different applications\nof this generated shared secret: message obfuscation, trust delegation, and\nencrypted beacons. We have implemented the message obfuscation on Android as an\nindependent app that can be used for private communication with trusted\ncontacts. We also present research on the usability, design considerations, and\nfurther integration of these tools in mainstream services.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub450 \uac1c

Existing\nbenchmarks typically assess LLMs through abstract or low-dimensional\nalgorithmic tasks, failing to capture the complexity of realistic planning\nenvironments. We introduce HeroBench, a novel benchmark designed specifically\nto evaluate long-horizon planning and structured reasoning within complex\nRPG-inspired virtual worlds. HeroBench provides a rigorously constructed\ndataset of tasks covering a wide range of difficulties, a simulated environment\nto execute and validate agent plans, and detailed analytical tools for\nevaluating model performance. Tasks challenge models to formulate strategic\nplans, efficiently gather resources, master necessary skills, craft equipment,\nand defeat adversaries, reflecting practical scenarios' layered dependencies\nand constraints. Our extensive evaluation of 25 state-of-the-art LLMs, spanning\nboth open-source and proprietary models, including the GPT-5 family, reveals\nsubstantial performance disparities rarely observed in conventional reasoning\nbenchmarks. Detailed error analysis further uncovers specific weaknesses in\ncurrent models' abilities to generate robust high-level plans and reliably\nexecute structured actions. HeroBench thus not only significantly advances the\nevaluation of LLM reasoning but also provides a flexible, scalable foundation\nfor future research into advanced, autonomous planning in virtual environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "HeroBench\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c RPG \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc740 \uac00\uc0c1 \uc138\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc7a5\uae30\uc801\uc778 \uacc4\ud68d \ubc0f \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ucd94\ub9ac\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc774 \uc218\ud559 \ubc0f \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d \uac19\uc740 \uace0\ub9bd\ub41c \ub2e8\uacc4\ubcc4 \ucd94\ub860 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc11c\ub85c \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294 \ub3d9\uc791\uc758 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc138quences\ub97c \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \uc7a5\uae30 \uacc4\ud68d\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825\uc740 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uac8c \ud0d0\uad6c\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "method": "HeroBench\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub09c\uc774\ub3c4\uc758 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud3ec\uad04\ud558\ub294 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud558\uac8c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc640 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc2e4\ud589\ud558\uace0 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ud658\uacbd, \ubaa8\ub378 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c1\uc138\ud55c \ubd84\uc11d \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "25\uac1c\uc758 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 LLM\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uae30\uc874 \ucd94\ub860 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub4dc\ubb3c\uac8c \uad00\ucc30\ub418\ub294 \ud604\uc800\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5 \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "HeroBench\ub294 LLM \ucd94\ub860 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \ud06c\uac8c \ubc1c\uc804\uc2dc\ud0ac \ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uac00\uc0c1 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uace0\uae09 \uc790\uc728 \uacc4\ud68d\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud5a5\ud6c4 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc720\uc5f0\ud558\uace0 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \uc218\ud559 \ubc0f \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uace0\ub9bd\ub41c \ub2e8\uacc4\ubcc4 \ucd94\ub860 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub180\ub77c\uc6b4 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc11c\ub85c \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294 \ud589\ub3d9\uc758 \uc5f0\uc7a5\ub41c \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\ub97c \uc694\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \uc7a5\uae30 \uacc4\ud68d\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825\uc740 \uc544\uc9c1 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \ud0d0\uad6c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\uc0c1\uc801\uc774\uac70\ub098 \uc800\ucc28\uc6d0 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 LLM\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uba70, \uc2e4\uc81c \uacc4\ud68d \ud658\uacbd\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c RPG\uc5d0\uc11c \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc740 \uac00\uc0c1 \uc138\uacc4 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc7a5\uae30 \uacc4\ud68d \ubc0f \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ucd94\ub9ac\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud2b9\ubcc4\ud788 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc778 HeroBench\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.

In contrast, classical\noptimization methods are data-efficient and lightweight but often suffer from\nslow convergence. While learned optimizers offer a promising fusion of both\nworlds, most focus on first-order methods, leaving learned second-order\napproaches largely unexplored.\n  We propose a novel learned second-order optimizer that introduces a trainable\npreconditioning unit to enhance the classical Symmetric-Rank-One (SR1)\nalgorithm. This unit generates data-driven vectors used to construct positive\nsemi-definite rank-one matrices, aligned with the secant constraint via a\nlearned projection.

Traditionally, FSMs are implemented by\nhardware engineers through Verilog coding, which is often tedious and\ntime-consuming. Recently, with the remarkable progress of Large Language Models\n(LLMs) in code generation, LLMs have been increasingly explored for automating\nVerilog code generation. However, LLM-generated Verilog code often suffers from\nsecurity vulnerabilities, which is particularly concerning for\nsecurity-sensitive FSM implementations. To address this issue, we propose\nSecFSM, a novel method that leverages a security-oriented knowledge graph to\nguide LLMs in generating more secure Verilog code. Specifically, we first\nconstruct a FSM Security Knowledge Graph (FSKG) as an external aid to LLMs.\nSubsequently, we analyze users' requirements to identify vulnerabilities and\nget a list of vulnerabilities in the requirements. Then, we retrieve knowledge\nfrom FSKG based on the vulnerabilities list. Finally, we construct security\nprompts based on the security knowledge for Verilog code generation. To\nevaluate SecFSM, we build a dedicated dataset collected from academic datasets,\nartificial datasets, papers, and industrial cases.

To address these problems, we propose Context Refactoring\nContrast (CRoC), a simple yet effective framework that trains GNNs for GAD by\njointly leveraging limited labeled and abundant unlabeled data. Different from\nprevious works, CRoC exploits the class imbalance inherent in GAD to refactor\nthe context of each node, which builds augmented graphs by recomposing the\nattributes of nodes while preserving their interaction patterns. Furthermore,\nCRoC encodes heterogeneous relations separately and integrates them into the\nmessage-passing process, enhancing the model's capacity to capture complex\ninteraction semantics. These operations preserve node semantics while\nencouraging robustness to adversarial camouflage, enabling GNNs to uncover\nintricate anomalous cases. In the training stage, CRoC is further integrated\nwith the contrastive learning paradigm. This allows GNNs to effectively harness\nunlabeled data during joint training, producing richer, more discriminative\nnode embeddings. CRoC is evaluated on seven real-world GAD datasets with\nvarying scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CRoC achieves up to 14%\nAUC improvement over baseline GNNs and outperforms state-of-the-art GAD methods\nunder limited-label settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "CRoC\ub294 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ub808\uc774\ube14 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \ube44\ub808\uc774\ube14 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec GNN\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\uc2dc\ucf1c \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0(GAD)\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud604\uc2e4 \uc138\uacc4\uc758 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0\uc11c GNN \ud6c8\ub828\uc5d0 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ub808\uc774\ube14 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ubd80\uc871\uc740 GAD\uc758 \uc9c4\ud589\uc744 \uc2ec\uac01\ud558\uac8c \uc800\ud574\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "CRoC\ub294 GAD\uc758 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4 \ubd88\uade0\ud615\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac01 \ub178\ub4dc\uc758 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \ub9ac\ud329\ud1a0\ub9c1\ud558\uace0 \ub178\ub4dc\uc758 \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \uc7ac\uc870\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf4\uac15 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uba70, \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ubcc4\ub3c4\ub85c \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ud558\uc5ec \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0 \uc804\ub2ec \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "CRoC\ub294 7\uac1c\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c GAD \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \ucd5c\ub300 14%\uc758 AUC \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \uae30\ub85d\ud558\uace0 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ub808\uc774\ube14 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc2e0 GAD \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc744 \ucd08\uc6d4\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "CRoC\ub294 GNN\uc774 \uc801\ub300\uc801\uc778 \uc704\uc7a5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacac\uace0\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba74\uc11c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uc758\ubbf8\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(GNN)\uc740 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uad6c\uc870\ud654 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\uba70 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uad00\ub828 \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \uc5d4\uc9c4\uc73c\ub85c \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub41c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098, \uac15\ub825\ud55c GNN \ud6c8\ub828\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \ub9ce\uc740 \ub808\uc774\ube14 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub294 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \uc0ac\uac74\uc774 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub4dc\ubb3c\uace0 \ub808\uc774\ube14 \ubd80\ucc29 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4e4\uba70, \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub97c \ud53c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uadf8 \ud328\ud134\uc744 actively camouflage \ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0(GAD)\uc758 \uc9c4\ud589\uc744 \uc2ec\uac01\ud558\uac8c \uc800\ud574\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 GAD\ub97c \uc704\ud574 GNN\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uac04\ub2e8\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Context Refactoring Contrast (CRoC)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\uc804 \uc791\uc5c5\uacfc\ub294 \ub2ec\ub9ac, CRoC\ub294 GAD\uc5d0 \ub0b4\uc7ac\ub41c \ud074\ub798\uc2a4 \ubd88\uade0\ud615\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac01 \ub178\ub4dc\uc758 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \ub9ac\ud329\ud1a0\ub9c1\ud558\uba70, \ub178\ub4dc\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ub178\ub4dc\uc758 \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \uc7ac\uc870\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf4\uac15 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, CRoC\ub294 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ubcc4\ub3c4\ub85c \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0 \uc804\ub2ec \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uc758\ubbf8\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc740 \ub178\ub4dc \uc758\ubbf8\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc801\ub300\uc801\uc778 \uc704\uc7a5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacac\uace0\uc131\uc744 \uac15\ud654\uc2dc\ucf1c GNN\uc774 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ube44\uc815\uc0c1 \uc0ac\ub840\ub97c \ubc1c\uacac\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4. \ud6c8\ub828 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c CRoC\ub294 \ub300\uc870 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uacfc \ud1b5\ud569\ub418\uc5b4 GNN\uc774 \uacf5\ub3d9 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc911\uc5d0 \ube44\ub808\uc774\ube14 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\uc5ec \ub354 \ud48d\ubd80\ud558\uace0 \ucc28\ubcc4\ud654\ub41c \ub178\ub4dc \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4.

For many organizations today, those\npostures have a foundation in the Zero Trust Architecture. This strategy sees\ntrust as something an enterprise must not give lightly or assume too broadly.\nUnderstanding the ZTA and its numerous controls centered around the idea of not\ntrusting anything inside or outside the network without verification, will\nallow organizations to comprehend and leverage this increasingly common\nparadigm. The ZTA, unlike many other regulatory frameworks, is not tightly\ndefined. The research assesses the likelihood of quantifiable guidelines that\nmeasure cybersecurity maturity for an enterprise organization in relation to\nZTA implementation. This is a new, data driven methodology for quantifying\ncyber resilience enabled by the adoption of Zero Trust principles to\npragmatically address the critical need of organizations. It also looks at the\npractical aspects ZTA has on capabilities in deterring cyberattacks on a\nnetwork. The outcomes of this research define a prescriptive set of key\ntechnical controls across identity verification, microsegmentation, data\nencryption, analytics, and orchestration that characterize the comprehensive\nZTA deployment.

However, multi-vendor assembly\nin post-fabrication environments fragments the supply chain and exposes SiP\nsystems to serious security threats, including cloning, overproduction, and\nchiplet substitution. Existing authentication solutions depend on trusted\nintegrators or centralized security anchors, which can expose sensitive data or\ncreate single points of failure. We introduce AuthenTree, a distributed\nauthentication framework that leverages multi-party computation (MPC) in a\nscalable tree-based architecture, removing the need for dedicated security\nhardware or centralized trust. AuthenTree enables secure chiplet validation\nwithout revealing raw signatures, distributing trust across multiple integrator\nchiplets. Our evaluation in five SiP benchmarks demonstrates that AuthenTree\nimposes minimal overhead, with an area as low as 0.48% (7,000 sq-micrometers),\nan overhead power under 0.5%, and an authentication latency below 1\nmicrosecond, surpassing previous work in some cases by 700 times.

Existing black-box\njailbreaking techniques primarily rely on static prompts crafted with a single,\nnon-adaptive strategy, or employ rigid combinations of several underperforming\nattack methods, which limits their adaptability and generalization. To address\nthese limitations, we propose MAJIC, a Markovian adaptive jailbreaking\nframework that attacks black-box LLMs by iteratively combining diverse\ninnovative disguise strategies. MAJIC first establishes a ``Disguise Strategy\nPool'' by refining existing strategies and introducing several innovative\napproaches. To further improve the attack performance and efficiency, MAJIC\nformulate the sequential selection and fusion of strategies in the pool as a\nMarkov chain. Under this formulation, MAJIC initializes and employs a Markov\nmatrix to guide the strategy composition, where transition probabilities\nbetween strategies are dynamically adapted based on attack outcomes, thereby\nenabling MAJIC to learn and discover effective attack pathways tailored to the\ntarget model. Our empirical results demonstrate that MAJIC significantly\noutperforms existing jailbreak methods on prominent models such as GPT-4o and\nGemini-2.0-flash, achieving over 90\\% attack success rate with fewer than 15\nqueries per attempt on average.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 MAJIC\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ud574\ud0b9 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uace0\uc815 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \ud574\ud0b9 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 \ud574\ud0b9 \uae30\uc220\uc740 \uc801\uc751\ub825\uc774 \ub5a8\uc5b4\uc9c0\uace0 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\uc5d0 \ud55c\uacc4\uac00 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc774\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud568.", "method": "MAJIC\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubcc0 disguise\uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 LLM\uc744 \uacf5\uaca9\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uccb4\uc778\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "MAJIC\ub294 GPT-4o \ubc0f Gemini-2.0-flash\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc8fc\uc694 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \ud574\ud0b9 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \ud3c9\uade0 15\ucffc\ub9ac \uc774\ud558\ub85c 90% \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \uae30\ub85d\ud568.", "conclusion": "MAJIC\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ub354 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud574\ud0b9 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uace0 \ud559\uc2b5\ud568.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \ub180\ub77c\uc6b4 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc785\ub825 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \uc870\uc791\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\ud574\ud55c \ucf58\ud150\uce20\ub97c \uc774\ub04c\uc5b4\ub0bc \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud0c8\uc625 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 \ud0c8\uc625 \uae30\uc220\uc740 \uc8fc\ub85c \uace0\uc815\ub41c \ud504\ub85c\u30f3\u30d7\ud2b8\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc800\uc131\ub2a5 \uacf5\uaca9 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \uacbd\uc9c1\ub41c \uc870\ud569\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ubbc0\ub85c \uc801\uc751\ub825\uacfc \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\uc5d0 \ud55c\uacc4\uac00 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud601\uc2e0\uc801\uc778 \ubcc0 disguise\uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 LLM\uc744 \uacf5\uaca9\ud558\ub294 \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ud0c8\uc625 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 MAJIC\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

They are also becoming increasingly complex, with recent trends\nindicating larger datasets, longer time series, and multi-modal integrations.\nTransformers, which have rapidly gained popularity due to their success in\nnatural language processing and other domains, are well-suited to address these\nchallenges due to their ability to model long-range dependencies and process\ndata in parallel.

BAT achieves state-of-the-art performance on sepsis prediction and is\ncompetitive to top methods for mortality classification. In comparison to other\ntransformers, BAT demonstrates increased robustness to data missingness, and\nlearns unique sensor embeddings which can be used in transfer learning.\nBaseline models, which were previously located across multiple repositories or\nutilized deprecated libraries, were re-implemented with PyTorch and made\navailable for reproduction and future benchmarking.", "AI": {"tldr": "Bi-Axial Transformer(BAT)\ub294 \uc804\uc790 \uac74\uac15 \uae30\ub85d\uc744 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc798 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uac1c\ubc1c\ub41c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud76c\uc18c\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0 \ub192\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc804\uc790 \uac74\uac15 \uae30\ub85d(EHR)\uc774 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud574\uc9d0\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ubd84\ub958 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "BAT \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 EHR \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uc784\uc0c1 \ubcc0\uc218\uc640 \uc2dc\uac04 \ucd95\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uace0\ub824\ud558\uc5ec \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "BAT\ub294 \ud328\ud608\uc99d \uc608\uce21\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uc0ac\ub9dd\ub960 \ubd84\ub958\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "BAT\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uacb0\uce21\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac15\uc778\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, transfer learning\uc5d0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub3c5\ud2b9\ud55c \uc13c\uc11c \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc804\uc790 \uac74\uac15 \uae30\ub85d(EHR)\uc740 \ud658\uc790\uc758 \uc758\ub8cc \uae30\ub85d\uc744 \ub514\uc9c0\ud138\ud654\ud55c \uac83\uc73c\ub85c, \uc5ed\ud559 \ubc0f \uc784\uc0c1 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc790\uc6d0\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc EHR\uc740 \ub354 \ud070 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8, \uae34 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4, \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ud1b5\ud569\uc73c\ub85c \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud574\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \ucc98\ub9ac \ubc0f \uae30\ud0c0 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc131\uacf5\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uae09\uc18d\ud788 \uc778\uae30\ub97c \uc5bb\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \ud2b8\ub79c\uc2a4\ud3ec\uba38\ub294 \uae34 \uac70\ub9ac \uc885\uc18d\uc131\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uace0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ubcd1\ub82c\ub85c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825 \ub355\ubd84\uc5d0 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc801\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 EHR \ubd84\ub958\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uadf8\ub4e4\uc758 \uc751\uc6a9\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc800\ud558\uc2dc\ud0a4\uac70\ub098 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc788\ub294 \uacb0\uce21\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud45c\ud604\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud76c\uc18c\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uad00\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc704\ud574 EHR \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uc784\uc0c1 \ubcc0\uc218 \ubc0f \uc2dc\uac04 \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8 \ucd95\uc744 \ubaa8\ub450 \uace0\ub824\ud558\ub294 Bi-Axial Transformer(BAT)\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Existing early detection techniques\noften require specialized security expertise, limiting their usability. Recent\nefforts have explored the use of large language models (LLMs) for Verilog\nvulnerability detection. However, LLMs struggle to capture the structure in\nVerilog code, resulting in inconsistent detection results. To this end, we\npropose VerilogLAVD, the first LLM-aided graph traversal rule generation\napproach for Verilog vulnerability detection. Our approach introduces the\nVerilog Property Graph (VeriPG), a unified representation of Verilog code. It\ncombines syntactic features extracted from the abstract syntax tree (AST) with\nsemantic information derived from control flow and data dependency graphs. We\nleverage LLMs to generate VeriPG-based detection rules from Common Weakness\nEnumeration (CWE) descriptions.

Local distance distributions,\nfrom a point to all others, are used to estimate the cardinality of the local\ncluster by identifying a local minimum in the density of the distance\ndistribution.

Code available at\n  https://github.com/ayushgupta4897/DRL-Cache", "summary": "Web proxies such as NGINX commonly rely on least-recently-used (LRU)\neviction, which is size agnostic and can thrash under periodic bursts and mixed\nobject sizes. We introduce Cold-RL, a learned eviction policy for NGINX that\nreplaces LRU's forced-expire path with a dueling Deep Q-Network served by an\nONNX sidecar within a strict microsecond budget. On each eviction, Cold-RL\nsamples the K least-recently-used objects, extracts six lightweight features\n(age, size, hit count, inter-arrival time, remaining TTL, and last origin RTT),\nand requests a bitmask of victims; a hard timeout of 500 microseconds triggers\nimmediate fallback to native LRU. Policies are trained offline by replaying\nNGINX access logs through a cache simulator with a simple reward: a retained\nobject earns one point if it is hit again before TTL expiry. We compare against\nLRU, LFU, size-based, adaptive LRU, and a hybrid baseline on two adversarial\nworkloads.

Threat Modeling, that is,\ncomprehending the consequences of these attacks, can provide critical support\nto cybersecurity professionals, enabling them to take timely action and\nallocate resources that could be used elsewhere. Cybersecurity is heavily\ndependent on threat modeling, as it assists security experts in assessing and\nmitigating risks related to identifying vulnerabilities and threats. Recently,\nthere has been a pressing need for automated methods to assess attack\ndescriptions and forecast the future consequences of the increasing complexity\nof cyberattacks. This study examines how Natural Language Processing (NLP) and\ndeep learning can be applied to analyze the potential impact of cyberattacks by\nleveraging textual descriptions from the MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration\n(CWE) database. We emphasize classifying attack consequences into five\nprincipal categories: Availability, Access Control, Confidentiality, Integrity,\nand Other. This paper investigates the use of Bidirectional Encoder\nRepresentations from Transformers (BERT) in combination with Hierarchical\nAttention Networks (HANs) for Multi-label classification, evaluating their\nperformance in comparison with conventional CNN and LSTM-based models.\nExperimental findings show that BERT achieves an overall accuracy of $0.972$,\nfar higher than conventional deep learning models in multi-label\nclassification. HAN outperforms baseline forms of CNN and LSTM-based models on\nspecific cybersecurity labels. However, BERT consistently achieves better\nprecision and recall, making it more suitable for predicting the consequences\nof a cyberattack.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \uacf5\uaca9\uc774

However, most large language model (LLM)-based ESC systems rely on\npredefined strategies, which limits their effectiveness in complex, real-life\nscenarios. To enable flexible responses to diverse emotional problem scenarios,\nthis paper introduces a novel end-to-end framework (RLFF-ESC) that directly\nlearns enduring emotionally supportive response skills using reinforcement\nlearning. For sustained emotional support, we first employ an LLM-based\nmulti-agent mechanism to simulate future dialogue trajectories and collect\nfuture-oriented rewards. We then train a future-oriented reward model, which is\nsubsequently used to train the emotional support policy model. Additionally, we\nincorporate an explicit reasoning process during response generation to further\nenhance the quality, relevance, and contextual appropriateness of the system's\nresponses. We evaluate the backbone policy model on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-1M and\nLLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct models, testing the proposed RLFF-ESC framework across two\npublic ESC datasets.

It turns out that this trust region\nbased strategy can be understood as a geometric annealing from the prior to the\ntarget measure, where, however, the incorporated trust regions lead to a\nprincipled and educated way of choosing the time steps in the annealing path.\nWe demonstrate in multiple optimal control applications that our novel method\ncan improve performance significantly, including tasks in diffusion-based\nsampling, transition path sampling, and fine-tuning of diffusion models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ud655\ub960 \ucd5c\uc801 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \uc5b4\ub2d0\ub9c1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubaa9\ud45c \uce21\uc815\uac12\uc5d0 \uc811\uadfc\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \ubaa9\ud45c \uce21\uc815\uac12\uacfc \uc0ac\uc804 \uce21\uc815\uac12\uc774 \ud06c\uac8c \ub2e4\ub97c \uacbd\uc6b0 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc774 \uc788\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uba70, \uc2e0\ub8b0 \uad6c\uc5ed\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uc5ec \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa9\ud45c \uce21\uc815\uac12\uc5d0 \uc811\uadfc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ud655\uc0b0 \uae30\ubc18 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1, \uc804\uc774 \uacbd\ub85c \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \ubc0f \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815 \ub4f1\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uc5ec\ub7ec \ucd5c\uc801 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc2e0\ub8b0 \uad6c\uc5ed \uae30\ubc18 \uc804\ub7b5\uc740 \uc0ac\uc804\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa9\ud45c \uce21\uc815\uac12\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \uc5b4\ub2d0\ub9c1\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\ud574\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774\ucc28 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \ud655\ub960 \ucd5c\uc801 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ubaa9\ud45c \uacbd\ub85c \uacf5\uac04 \uce21\uc815\uac12\uc744 \uadfc\uc0ac\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ubcfc \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc608\ub97c \ub4e4\uc5b4 \uacbd\ub7c9 \uae30\ubc18 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc2e4\uc81c\ub85c \uc774 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub294 \ubaa9\ud45c \uce21\uc815\uac12\uc774 \uc0ac\uc804\uacfc \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \ub2e4\ub97c \uacbd\uc6b0 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\ub294\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubaa9\ud45c \uce21\uc815\uac12\uc5d0 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc811\uadfc\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc2e0\ub8b0 \uad6c\uc5ed\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \uc81c\uc57d \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc811\uadfc\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc2e0\ub8b0 \uad6c\uc5ed \uae30\ubc18 \uc804\ub7b5\uc740 \uc0ac\uc804\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa9\ud45c \uce21\uc815\uac12\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \uc5b4\ub2d0\ub9c1\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\ud574\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ud3ec\ud568\ub41c \uc2e0\ub8b0 \uad6c\uc5ed\uc740 \uc5b4\ub2d0\ub9c1 \uacbd\ub85c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\uac04 \ub2e8\uacc4 \uc120\ud0dd\uc744 \ub354 \uc6d0\uce59\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uae30 \uc26c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\ub04c\uc5b4 \uc900\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud655\uc0b0 \uae30\ubc18 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1, \uc804\uc774 \uacbd\ub85c \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \ubc0f \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uc5ec\ub7ec \ucd5c\uc801 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4."}}

This paper\nintroduces OPTIC-ER, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for real-time,\nadaptive, and equitable emergency response. OPTIC-ER uses an attention-guided\nactor-critic architecture to manage the complexity of dispatch environments.\nIts key innovations are a Context-Rich State Vector, encoding action\nsub-optimality, and a Precision Reward Function, which penalizes inefficiency.\nTraining occurs in a high-fidelity simulation using real data from Rivers\nState, Nigeria, accelerated by a precomputed Travel Time Atlas. The system is\nbuilt on the TALS framework (Thin computing, Adaptability, Low-cost,\nScalability) for deployment in low-resource settings. In evaluations on 500\nunseen incidents, OPTIC-ER achieved a 100.00% optimality rate with negligible\ninefficiency, confirming its robustness and generalization. Beyond dispatch,\nthe system generates Infrastructure Deficiency Maps and Equity Monitoring\nDashboards to guide proactive governance and data-informed development.

These benchmarks commonly suffer from issues\nsuch as score saturation, temporal decay, and data contamination. To address\nthis challenge, this paper introduces EvolMathEval, an automated mathematical\nbenchmark generation and evolution framework based on evolutionary testing. By\ndynamically generating unique evaluation instances ab initio, the framework\nfundamentally eliminates the risk of data contamination, and ensuring the\nbenchmark remains perpetually challenging for future models.The core mechanisms\nof EvolMathEval include: seed problem generation based on reverse engineering\nwith algebraic guarantees; multi-dimensional genetic operators designed to\ninject diverse cognitive challenges; and a composite fitness function that can\nrapidly and accurately assess problem difficulty. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed composite fitness function can efficiently and\nprecisely quantify the difficulty of mathematical problems. Furthermore,\nEvolMathEval can not only generate a large volume of high-difficulty problems\nthrough continuous self-iteration, but it can also significantly enhance the\ncomplexity of public datasets like GSM8K through evolution, reducing model\naccuracy by an average of 48%. Deeper investigation reveals that when solving\nthese evolved, complex problems, LLMs tend to employ non-rigorous heuristics to\nbypass complex multi-step logical reasoning, consequently leading to incorrect\nsolutions. We define this phenomenon as \"Pseudo Aha Moment\". This finding\nuncovers a cognitive shortcut-taking behavior in the deep reasoning processes\nof current LLMs, which we find accounts for 77% to 100% of errors on targeted\nproblems.

To avoid posterior collapse, many prior\nworks have tried to control the influence of regularization loss. However, the\ntrade-off between reconstruction and regularization is not satisfactory. For\nthis reason, several methods have been proposed to guarantee latent\nidentifiability, which is the key to avoiding posterior collapse. However, they\nrequire structural constraints on the network architecture. For further\nclarification, we define local posterior collapse to reflect the importance of\nindividual sample points in the data space and to relax the network constraint.\nThen, we propose Latent Reconstruction(LR) loss, which is inspired by\nmathematical properties of injective and composite functions, to control\nposterior collapse without restriction to a specific architecture.

E-graph extraction is a challenging\nNP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. It requires identifying optimal\nterms from exponentially many equivalent expressions, serving as the primary\nperformance bottleneck in e-graph based optimization tasks. However,\ntraditional extraction methods face a critical trade-off: heuristic approaches\noffer speed but sacrifice optimality, while exact methods provide optimal\nsolutions but face prohibitive computational costs on practical problems. We\npresent e-boost, a novel framework that bridges this gap through three key\ninnovations: (1) parallelized heuristic extraction that leverages weak data\ndependence to compute DAG costs concurrently, enabling efficient multi-threaded\nperformance without sacrificing extraction quality; (2) adaptive search space\npruning that employs a parameterized threshold mechanism to retain only\npromising candidates, dramatically reducing the solution space while preserving\nnear-optimal solutions; and (3) initialized exact solving that formulates the\nreduced problem as an Integer Linear Program with warm-start capabilities,\nguiding solvers toward high-quality solutions faster.\n  Across the diverse benchmarks in formal verification and logic synthesis\nfields, e-boost demonstrates 558x runtime speedup over traditional exact\napproaches (ILP) and 19.04% performance improvement over the state-of-the-art\nextraction framework (SmoothE).

We challenge this\nbelief through systematic testing, showing that poor optimization choices,\nrather than inherent trade-offs, often cause safety problems, measured as\nharmful responses to adversarial prompts. By properly selecting key training\nhyper-parameters, e.g., learning rate, batch size, and gradient steps, we\nreduce unsafe model responses from 16\\% to approximately 5\\%, as measured by\nkeyword matching, while maintaining utility performance. Based on this\nobservation, we propose a simple exponential moving average (EMA) momentum\ntechnique in parameter space that preserves safety performance by creating a\nstable optimization path and retains the original pre-trained model's safety\nproperties. Our experiments on the Llama families across multiple datasets\n(Dolly, Alpaca, ORCA) demonstrate that safety problems during fine-tuning can\nlargely be avoided without specialized interventions, outperforming existing\napproaches that require additional safety data while offering practical\nguidelines for maintaining both model performance and safety during adaptation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc774 \uc885\uc885 \uc548\uc804\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \uc54c\ub824\uc838 \uc788\uc73c\ub098, \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc120\ud0dd\uc774 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc6d0\uc778\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uace0 \ud575\uc2ec \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130\ub97c \uc870\uc815\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc548\uc804\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uc751\ub2f5 \ube44\uc728\uc744 \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc774 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc5d0 \ubd80\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce5c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac15\ud55c \ubbff\uc74c\uc744 \ub3c4\uc804\ud558\uace0, \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud560 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ucc3e\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud584\ubc84\uac70 \ube44\uc728 \ubc0f \uc8fc\uae30\uc801\uc778 \ub9e4\uce6d\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \uc9c0\uc218 \uc774\ub3d9 \ud3c9\uade0(EMA) \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \ud655\ubcf4\ud558\uace0, \uc6d0\ub798 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc548\uc804 \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc874\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud558\uc774\ud37c\ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \uc120\ud0dd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc548\uc804\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 16%\uc5d0\uc11c \uc57d 5%\ub85c \uc904\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ucd94\uac00\uc801\uc778 \uc548\uc804 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc548\uc804\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub300\ubd80\ubd84 \ud53c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uc548\uc804\uc5d0 \ud574\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc694\uccad\uc5d0 \uc751\ub2f5\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\uba70, \ubb34\ud574\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \ub54c\ub3c4 \ucd94\uac00 \uc548\uc804 \uc870\uce58\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4\uace0 \uc5ec\uaca8\uc9c4\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\ub294 \ub0b4\uc7ac\ub41c \ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ub4dc\uc624\ud504\uac00 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \ubd88\ub7c9 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc120\ud0dd\uc774 \uc548\uc804 \ubb38\uc81c\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc6d0\uc778\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \uc8fc\uc694 \ud6c8\ub828 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130\ub97c \uc801\uc808\ud788 \uc120\ud0dd\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud0a4\uc6cc\ub4dc \ub9e4\uce6d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uce21\uc815\ud55c \ubd80\uc801\uc808\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378 \uc751\ub2f5 \ube44\uc728\uc744 16%\uc5d0\uc11c \uc57d 5%\ub85c \uc904\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uc720\ud2f8\ub9ac\ud2f0 \uc131\ub2a5\ub3c4 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uc6d0\ub798\uc758 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc548\uc804 \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc874\ud558\ub294 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \uc9c0\uc218 \uc774\ub3d9 \ud3c9\uade0(EMA) \ubaa8\uba58\ud140 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b(Dolly, Alpaca, ORCA)\uc5d0\uc11c Llama \uacc4\uc5f4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc740 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815 \uc911\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud2b9\uc218\ud55c \uac1c\uc785 \uc5c6\uc774 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84 \ud53c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud558\uba70, \ubaa8\ub378 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \uc548\uc804\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uac00\uc774\ub4dc\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4."}}

Nevertheless,\nour preliminary experiments reveal that the generation quality of MDMs is still\nhighly sensitive to the choice of decoding strategy. In particular, widely\nadopted uncertainty-based samplers suffer from two key limitations: a lack of\nglobal trajectory control and a pronounced bias toward trivial tokens in the\nearly stages of decoding. These shortcomings restrict the full potential of\nMDMs. In this work, we introduce Position-Aware Confidence-Calibrated Sampling\n(PC-Sampler), a novel decoding strategy that unifies global trajectory planning\nwith content-aware informativeness maximization. PC-Sampler incorporates a\nposition-aware weighting mechanism to regulate the decoding path and a\ncalibrated confidence score to suppress the premature selection of trivial\ntokens. Extensive experiments on three advanced MDMs across seven challenging\nbenchmarks-including logical reasoning and planning tasks-demonstrate that\nPC-Sampler consistently outperforms existing MDM decoding strategies by more\nthan 10% on average, significantly narrowing the performance gap with\nstate-of-the-art autoregressive models.

However, current practices often rely on rigid pipelines that\noverlook critical data-centric choices in how brain graphs are constructed. In\nthis work, we adopt a Data-Centric AI perspective and systematically define and\nbenchmark a data-centric design space for brain graph construction,\nconstrasting with primarily model-centric prior work. We organize this design\nspace into three stages: temporal signal processing, topology extraction, and\ngraph featurization. Our contributions lie less in novel components and more in\nevaluating how combinations of existing and modified techniques influence\ndownstream performance. Specifically, we study high-amplitude BOLD signal\nfiltering, sparsification and unification strategies for connectivity,\nalternative correlation metrics, and multi-view node and edge features, such as\nincorporating lagged dynamics.

However, existing methods often face challenges in terms of\nefficiency, scalability, and generalization. This paper introduces OS-R1, an\nagentic Linux kernel tuning framework powered by rule-based reinforcement\nlearning (RL). By abstracting the kernel configuration space as an RL\nenvironment, OS-R1 facilitates efficient exploration by large language models\n(LLMs) and ensures accurate configuration modifications. Additionally, custom\nreward functions are designed to enhance reasoning standardization,\nconfiguration modification accuracy, and system performance awareness of the\nLLMs. Furthermore, we propose a two-phase training process that accelerates\nconvergence and minimizes retraining across diverse tuning scenarios.\nExperimental results show that OS-R1 significantly outperforms existing\nbaseline methods, achieving up to 5.6% performance improvement over heuristic\ntuning and maintaining high data efficiency. Notably, OS-R1 is adaptable across\nvarious real-world applications, demonstrating its potential for practical\ndeployment in diverse environments.

While the effective\nintegration of multiple modalities could yield a holistic clinical profile that\naccurately models the true clinical situation with respect to data modalities\nand their relatives weightings, current methodologies remain limited by: 1) the\nscarcity of patient- and time-aligned multimodal data; 2) reliance on isolated\nsingle-modality or rigid multimodal input combinations; 3) alignment strategies\nthat prioritize cross-modal similarity over complementarity; and 4) a narrow\nsingle-task focus. In response to these limitations, a comprehensive multimodal\ndataset was curated for immediate application, integrating laboratory test\nresults, electrocardiograms, and echocardiograms with clinical outcomes.\nSubsequently, a unified framework, Textual Guidance Multimodal fusion for\nMultiple cardiac tasks (TGMM), was proposed. TGMM incorporated three key\ncomponents: 1) a MedFlexFusion module designed to capture the unique and\ncomplementary characteristics of medical modalities and dynamically integrate\ndata from diverse cardiac sources and their combinations; 2) a textual guidance\nmodule to derive task-relevant representations tailored to diverse clinical\nobjectives, including heart disease diagnosis, risk stratification and\ninformation retrieval; and 3) a response module to produce final decisions for\nall these tasks.

Despite the emergence of various frameworks, e.g.,\nLangChain, AutoML, and AIDE, ML scientists still struggle to effectively review\nand adjust the agents' coding process. The current approach of manually\ninspecting individual outputs is inefficient, making it difficult to track code\nevolution, compare coding iterations, and identify improvement opportunities.\nTo address this challenge, we introduce a visual analytics system designed to\nenhance the examination of coding agent behaviors. Focusing on the AIDE\nframework, our system supports comparative analysis across three levels: (1)\nCode-Level Analysis, which reveals how the agent debugs and refines its code\nover iterations; (2) Process-Level Analysis, which contrasts different\nsolution-seeking processes explored by the agent; and (3) LLM-Level Analysis,\nwhich highlights variations in coding behavior across different LLMs. By\nintegrating these perspectives, our system enables ML scientists to gain a\nstructured understanding of agent behaviors, facilitating more effective\ndebugging and prompt engineering.

Using this\nbenchmark, we evaluate three popular open-source agent frameworks combined with\ntwo LLM backbones, observing a task completion rate of approximately 50%.\nThrough in-depth failure analysis, we develop a three-tier taxonomy of failure\ncauses aligned with task phases, highlighting planning errors, task execution\nissues, and incorrect response generation.

When expensive high-dimensional\ndynamical systems are coarse-grained into low-dimensional models, the entropic\nloss of information leads to emergent physics which are dissipative,\nhistory-dependent, and stochastic. To machine learn coarse-grained dynamics\nfrom time-series observations of particle trajectories, we propose a framework\nusing the metriplectic bracket formalism that preserves these properties by\nconstruction; most notably, the framework guarantees discrete notions of the\nfirst and second laws of thermodynamics, conservation of momentum, and a\ndiscrete fluctuation-dissipation balance crucial for capturing non-equilibrium\nstatistics. We introduce the mathematical framework abstractly before\nspecializing to a particle discretization. As labels are generally unavailable\nfor entropic state variables, we introduce a novel self-supervised learning\nstrategy to identify emergent structural variables. We validate the method on\nbenchmark systems and demonstrate its utility on two challenging examples: (1)\ncoarse-graining star polymers at challenging levels of coarse-graining while\npreserving non-equilibrium statistics, and (2) learning models from high-speed\nvideo of colloidal suspensions that capture coupling between local\nrearrangement events and emergent stochastic dynamics.

A key distinction between FL and\ncentralized learning is that clients' data are non-independent and identically\ndistributed, which poses significant challenges in training a global model that\ngeneralizes well across heterogeneous local data distributions. In this paper,\nwe analyze the convergence of overparameterized FedAvg with gradient descent\n(GD). We prove that the impact of data heterogeneity diminishes as the width of\nneural networks increases, ultimately vanishing when the width approaches\ninfinity.

While Physics-Informed\nNeural Networks (PINNs) enforce PDE constraints point-wise, this paper adopts a\nphysics-informed deep operator network (PI-DeepONet) framework that\nreformulates TSE as an operator learning problem. Our approach trains a\nparameterized neural operator that maps sparse input data to the full\nspatiotemporal traffic state field, governed by the traffic flow conservation\nlaw. Crucially, unlike PINNs that enforce PDE constraints point-wise,\nPI-DeepONet integrates traffic flow conservation model and the fundamental\ndiagram directly into the operator learning process, ensuring physical\nconsistency while capturing congestion propagation, spatial correlations, and\ntemporal evolution. Experiments on the NGSIM dataset demonstrate superior\nperformance over state-of-the-art baselines.

However, mainstream post-training\nmethods (i.e., reinforcement learning (RL) with chain-of-thought (CoT)\nreasoning) often incur substantial computational overhead due to auxiliary\nmodels and overthinking. In this paper, we empirically reveal that the\nincorrect answers partially stem from verbose reasoning processes lacking\ncorrect self-fix, where errors accumulate across multiple reasoning steps. To\nthis end, we propose Self-traced Step-wise Preference Optimization (SSPO), a\npluggable RL process supervision framework that enables fine-grained\noptimization of each reasoning step.

However, the price we pay for their impressively accurate\npredictions is significant: their inner workings are notoriously opaque - it is\nunknown to laypeople and researchers alike what features of the data a DL\nsystem focuses on and how it ultimately succeeds in predicting correct outputs.\nA necessary criterion for trustworthy explanations is that they should reflect\nthe relevant processes the algorithms' predictions are based on. The field of\neXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) presents promising methods to create\nsuch explanations. But recent reviews about their performance offer reasons for\nskepticism. As we will argue, a good criterion for trustworthiness is\nexplanatory robustness: different XAI methods produce the same explanations in\ncomparable contexts. However, in some instances, all methods may give the same,\nbut still wrong, explanation. We therefore argue that in addition to\nexplanatory robustness (ER), a prior requirement of explanation method\nrobustness (EMR) has to be fulfilled by every XAI method. Conversely, the\nrobustness of an individual method is in itself insufficient for\ntrustworthiness. In what follows, we develop and formalize criteria for ER as\nwell as EMR, providing a framework for explaining and establishing trust in DL\nalgorithms.

Koes"], "title": "FlowMol3: Flow Matching for 3D De Novo Small-Molecule Generation", "comment": null, "summary": "A generative model capable of sampling realistic molecules with desired\nproperties could accelerate chemical discovery across a wide range of\napplications. Toward this goal, significant effort has focused on developing\nmodels that jointly sample molecular topology and 3D structure. We present\nFlowMol3, an open-source, multi-modal flow matching model that advances the\nstate of the art for all-atom, small-molecule generation. Its substantial\nperformance gains over previous FlowMol versions are achieved without changes\nto the graph neural network architecture or the underlying flow matching\nformulation. Instead, FlowMol3's improvements arise from three\narchitecture-agnostic techniques that incur negligible computational cost:\nself-conditioning, fake atoms, and train-time geometry distortion.

However, previous approaches mainly use Stein gradient\nestimators, which are computationally expensive and memory-intensive. Although\nDiffAN addresses these limitations by substituting kernel-based estimates with\ndiffusion models, it remains numerically unstable due to the second-order\nderivatives of score models. To alleviate these problems, we propose\nScore-informed Neural Operator (SciNO), a probabilistic generative model in\nsmooth function spaces designed to stably approximate the Hessian diagonal and\nto preserve structural information during the score modeling. Empirical results\nshow that SciNO reduces order divergence by 42.7% on synthetic graphs and by\n31.5% on real-world datasets on average compared to DiffAN, while maintaining\nmemory efficiency and scalability. Furthermore, we propose a probabilistic\ncontrol algorithm for causal reasoning with autoregressive models that\nintegrates SciNO's probability estimates with autoregressive model priors,\nenabling reliable data-driven causal ordering informed by semantic information.\nConsequently, the proposed method enhances causal reasoning abilities of LLMs\nwithout additional fine-tuning or prompt engineering.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 Score-informed Neural Operator (SciNO)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc778\uacfc \ubc1c\uacac \ubc0f \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc778\uacfc \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc758 \uc704\uc0c1\uc801 \uc21c\uc11c\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uc5ec \uc870\ud569 \uac80\uc0c9 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub300\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "Score-informed Neural Operator (SciNO)\ub294 \ub9e4\ub044\ub7ec\uc6b4 \ud568\uc218 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c Hessian \ub300\uac01\uc120\uc758 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uadfc\uc0ac\ub97c \uc124\uacc4\ud558\ub294 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "SciNO\ub294 \ud569\uc131 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc5d0\uc11c 42.7%, \uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c 31.5%\uc758 \uc21c\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0b0 \uac10\uc18c\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ucd94\uac00\uc801\uc778 \ud30c\uc778 \ud29c\ub2dd\uc774\ub098 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\ub9c1 \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 LLM\uc758 \uc778\uacfc \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc778\uacfc \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc21c\uc11c \uae30\ubc18 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc778\uacfc \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc758 \uc704\uc0c1\uc801 \uc21c\uc11c\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uc5ec \uc870\ud569 \uac80\uc0c9 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub300\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac00\ubc95 \uc7a1\uc74c \ubaa8\ub378(ANM) \uac00\uc815 \ud558\uc5d0 \ucd5c\uadfc\uc758 \uc810\uc218 \uc77c\uce58 \uae30\ubc18 \uc778\uacfc \uc21c\uc11c\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ub85c\uadf8 \ubc00\ub3c4\uc758 \ud5e4\uc2dc\uc548 \ub300\uac01\uc120\uc744 \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \ucd94\uc815\ud574\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc8fc\ub85c \uc2a4\ud2f4 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \ucd94\uc815\uae30\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4e4\uace0 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\uac00 \ub9ce\uc774 \uc18c\ubaa8\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Therefore, many new TL research areas emerge in the field, such as\nselecting the right source model for TL. However, these research directions\nrequire massive amounts of thermal building data which is lacking presently.\nNeither public datasets nor existing data generators meet the needs of TL\nresearch in terms of data quality and quantity. Moreover, existing data\ngeneration approaches typically require expert knowledge in building\nsimulation. We present BuilDa, a thermal building data generation framework for\nproducing synthetic data of adequate quality and quantity for TL research.

Despite its benefits, FFT on resource-constrained\nclients relies on the high computational and memory demands of full-model\nfine-tuning, which limits the potential advancement. This paper presents\nFedSODA, a resource-efficient FFT framework that enables clients to adapt LLMs\nwithout accessing or storing the full model. Specifically, we first propose a\nsimilarity group pruning (SGP) module, which prunes redundant layers from the\nfull LLM while retaining the most critical layers to preserve the model\nperformance. Moreover, we introduce an orchestrated distillation alignment\n(ODA) module to reduce gradient divergence between the sub-LLM and the full LLM\nduring FFT. Through the use of the QLoRA, clients only need to deploy quantized\nsub-LLMs and fine-tune lightweight adapters, significantly reducing local\nresource requirements. We conduct extensive experiments on three open-source\nLLMs across a variety of downstream tasks.

However, most existing methods assume identical model architectures\nacross clients, limiting their applicability in heterogeneous real-world\nenvironments. To address this, we propose FedUNet, a lightweight and\narchitecture-agnostic FL framework that attaches a U-Net-inspired additive\nmodule to each client's backbone. By sharing only the compact bottleneck of the\nU-Net, FedUNet enables efficient knowledge transfer without structural\nalignment. The encoder-decoder design and skip connections in the U-Net help\ncapture both low-level and high-level features, facilitating the extraction of\nclientinvariant representations. This enables cooperative learning between the\nbackbone and the additive module with minimal communication cost.

Each category\nis evaluated across multiple resolutions to assess scalability and\ngeneralization properties. The automated pipeline encompasses a complete\nmachine learning workflow including: synthetic dataset generation, standardized\ntraining with cross-validation, inference execution, and comprehensive\nevaluation using Dice coefficient and IoU (Intersection over Union) metrics.\nPreliminary experimental results demonstrate significant challenges in neural\nnetwork spatial reasoning capabilities, revealing systematic failures in basic\ngeometric and topological understanding tasks.

Using six years of hourly data\ncollected in Corsica (France) from multiple energy sources (solar, wind, hydro,\nthermal, bioenergy, and imported electricity), our approach predicts both\nindividual energy outputs and total production (\\cyr{including imports, which\nclosely follow energy demand, modulo losses)} through a Multi-Input\nMulti-Output ($\\mathtt{MIMO}$) architecture. To address non-stationarity and\nseasonal variability, sliding window techniques and cyclic time encoding are\nincorporated, enabling dynamic adaptation to fluctuations. The $\\mathtt{ELM}$\nmodel significantly outperforms persistence-based forecasting, particularly for\nsolar and thermal energy, achieving an $\\mathtt{nRMSE}$ of $17.9\\%$ and\n$5.1\\%$, respectively, with $\\mathtt{R^2} > 0.98$ (1-hour horizon).

This\nnecessity arises to ensure optimal resource allocation and maintain operational\nefficiency in inherently volatile environments. At the core of a predictive\nauto-scaling system is the workload forecasting model. Existing forecasting\nmodels struggle to quickly adapt to the dynamics in online workload streams and\nhave difficulty capturing the complex periodicity brought by fine-grained,\nhigh-frequency forecasting tasks. Addressing this, we propose a novel online\nensemble model, E3Former, for online workload forecasting in large-scale\npredictive auto-scaling. Our model synergizes the predictive capabilities of\nmultiple subnetworks to surmount the limitations of single-model approaches,\nthus ensuring superior accuracy and robustness. Remarkably, it accomplishes\nthis with a minimal increase in computational overhead, adhering to the lean\noperational ethos of serverless systems. Through extensive experimentation on\nreal-world workload datasets, we establish the efficacy of our ensemble model.\nIn online forecasting tasks, the proposed method reduces forecast error by an\naverage of 10%, and its effectiveness is further demonstrated through a\npredictive auto-scaling test in the real-life online system. Currently, our\nmethod has been deployed within ByteDance's Intelligent Horizontal Pod\nAuto-scaling (IHPA) platform, which supports the stable operation of over 30\napplications, such as Douyin E-Comerce, TouTiao, and Volcano Engine. The\npredictive auto-scaling capacity reaching over 600,000 CPU cores. On the basis\nof essentially ensuring service quality, the predictive auto-scaling system can\nreduce resource utilization by over 40%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc11c\ubc84\ub9ac\uc2a4

From this perspective, over-smoothing can be interpreted as a\nconsequence of the dissipative nature of the underlying diffusion dynamics.\nMotivated by this physical interpretation, we propose Wavy Transformer, which\nconsists of a novel attention layer based on second-order wavy dynamics.

We present Bridge, a unified statistical\nframework that explicitly bridges human and LLM evaluations under both absolute\nscoring and pairwise comparison paradigms. Bridge posits a latent human\npreference score for each prompt-response pair and models LLM deviations as\nlinear transformations of covariates that capture sources of discrepancies.\nThis offers a simple and principled framework for refining LLM ratings and\ncharacterizing systematic discrepancies between humans and LLMs. We provide an\nefficient fitting algorithm with asymptotic guarantees for statistical\ninference. Using six LLM judges and two benchmarks (BigGen Bench and Chatbot\nArena), Bridge achieves higher agreement with human ratings (accuracy,\ncalibration, and KL divergence) and exposes systematic human-LLM gaps.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc774 \uc778\uac04 \ud310\ub2e8\uacfc\uc758 \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \uc904\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Bridge\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM\uc774 \ubaa8\ub378 \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud560 \ub54c, \uc778\uac04 \ud310\ub2e8\uacfc\uc758 \ucc28\uc774\uac00 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "Bridge\ub294 \uac01 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8-\uc751\ub2f5 \uc30d\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801\uc778 \uc778\uac04 \uc120\ud638 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uace0, LLM\uc758 \ud3b8\ucc28\ub97c \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\uc758 \uc6d0\uc778\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \uacf5\ubcc0\ub7c9\uc758 \uc120\ud615 \ubcc0\ud658\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc5ec\uc12f \uac1c\uc758 LLM \uc2ec\uc0ac\uc790\uc640 \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec Bridge\ub294 \uc778\uac04 \ud3c9\uac00\uc640\uc758 \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \uc77c\uce58\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \uc778\uac04-LLM \uac04\uc758 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 LLM \ub4f1\uae09\uc744 \uc815\uc81c\ud558\uace0 \uc778\uac04\uacfc LLM \uac04\uc758 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub97c \uc124\uba85\ud558\ub294 \uac04\ub2e8\ud558\uace0 \uc6d0\uce59\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378 \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud310\uc0ac(LLM-as-a-judge)\ub85c \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc774 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\ub098, \uc774\ub4e4\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00\ub294 \uc885\uc885 \uc778\uac04 \ud310\ub2e8\uacfc \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub974\uac8c \ub098\ud0c0\ub09c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc808\ub300 \uc810\uc218 \ub9e4\uae40\uacfc \uc30d\ube44\uad50 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uac04\uacfc LLM \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Bridge\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.

Traditional MoE networks impose an expert capacity\nconstraint to ensure GPU-friendly computation. However, this leads to token\ndropping when capacity is saturated and results in low hardware efficiency due\nto padding in underutilized experts. Removing the capacity constraint, in turn,\ncompromises load balancing and computational efficiency. To address these\nissues, we propose Maximum Score Routing ($\\mathbf{MaxScore}$), a novel MoE\nrouting paradigm that models routing as a minimum-cost maximum-flow problem and\nintegrates a SoftTopk operator.

However, it remains largely\nunderexplored for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs); furthermore, existing steering\ntechniques, such as mean steering, rely on a single steering vector, applied\nindependently of the input query. This paradigm faces limitations when the\ndesired behavior is dependent on the example at hand. For example, a safe\nanswer may consist in abstaining from answering when asked for an illegal\nactivity, or may point to external resources or consultation with an expert\nwhen asked about medical advice. In this paper, we investigate a fine-grained\nsteering that uses an input-specific linear shift. This shift is computed using\ncontrastive input-specific prompting. However, the input-specific prompts\nrequired for this approach are not known at test time. Therefore, we propose to\ntrain a small auxiliary module to predict the input-specific steering vector.\nOur approach, dubbed as L2S (Learn-to-Steer), demonstrates that it reduces\nhallucinations and enforces safety in MLLMs, outperforming other static\nbaselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud2b9\uc815 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uac15\uc81c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec LLM(MLLM)\uc758 \uc138\ubc00\ud55c \uc2a4\ud2f0\uc5b4\ub9c1 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLMs\uc758 \uc0ac\ud6c4 \uc720\ub3c4\ub294 \ud2b9\uc815 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uac15\uc81c\ud558\ub294 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \ubd80\uc0c1\ud588\uc9c0\ub9cc, MLLMs\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \ud0d0\uad6c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc785\ub825 \ud2b9\ud654 \uc120\ud615 \uc774\ub3d9\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc138\ubc00\ud55c \uc2a4\ud2f0\uc5b4\ub9c1\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ub300\uc870\uc801\uc778 \uc785\ub825 \ud2b9\ud654 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uacc4\uc0b0\ub41c\ub2e4.", "result": "L2S(\ud559\uc2b5-\uc2a4\ud2f0\uc5b4\ub9c1) \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 MLLMs\uc5d0\uc11c \ud658\uac01\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uace0 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud558\uba70, \ub2e4\ub978 \uc815\uc801 \uae30\uc900\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc2a4\ud2f0\uc5b4\ub9c1 \uae30\uc220\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uac00 \uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ub9de\uac8c \ub354 \uc801\uc808\ud788 \uc801\uc6a9\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc2a4\ud2f0\uc5b4\ub9c1\uc740 LLM\uc758 \ud2b9\uc815 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uac15\uc81c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0ac\ud6c4 \uc720\ub3c4\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \ubd80\uc0c1\ud588\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec LLM(MLLM)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \ud0d0\uad6c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uace0, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc2a4\ud2f0\uc5b4\ub9c1 \uae30\ubc95\uc740 \uc785\ub825 \ucffc\ub9ac\uc640 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc801\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc2a4\ud2f0\uc5b4\ub9c1 \ubca1\ud130\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc740 \uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \ud589\ub3d9\uc774 \ud604\uc7ac \uc0ac\ub840\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud560 \ub54c \ud55c\uacc4\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc608\ub97c \ub4e4\uc5b4, \ubd88\ubc95 \ud65c\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc9c8\ubb38\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \ub300\ub2f5\uc740 \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uac70\ub098, \uc758\ub8cc \uc0c1\ub2f4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc9c8\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc678\ubd80 \uc790\ub8cc\ub97c \uc9c0\uc801\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc640 \uc0c1\ub2f4\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc785\ub825 \ud2b9\ud654 \uc120\ud615 \uc774\ub3d9\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc138\ubc00\ud55c \uc2a4\ud2f0\uc5b4\ub9c1\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc774\ub3d9\uc740 \ub300\uc870\uc801\uc778 \uc785\ub825 \ud2b9\ud654 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uacc4\uc0b0\ub41c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc5d0 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc785\ub825 \ud2b9\ud654 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub294 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \uc54c \uc218 \uc5c6\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc785\ub825 \ud2b9\ud654 \uc2a4\ud2f0\uc5b4\ub9c1 \ubca1\ud130\ub97c \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \uc18c\uaddc\ubaa8 \ubcf4\uc870 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc778 L2S(\ud559\uc2b5-\uc2a4\ud2f0\uc5b4\ub9c1)\ub294 MLLM\uc5d0\uc11c \ud658\uac01\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uace0 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud558\uba70, \ub2e4\ub978 \uc815\uc801 \uae30\uc900\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4."}}

This paper presents an\nempirical study on storage-aware learning, focusing on the trade-off between\ndata quantity and quality via compression. We demonstrate that naive\nstrategies, such as uniform data dropping or one-size-fits-all compression, are\nsuboptimal.

While CCPs leverage Predict-then-Schedule architecture to improve QoS\nand profitability, accurate load forecasting remains challenging under traffic\nsurges. Existing methods either minimize mean absolute error, resulting in\nunderprovisioning and potential Service Level Agreement (SLA) violations during\npeak periods, or adopt conservative overprovisioning strategies, which mitigate\nSLA risks at the expense of increased resource expenditure. To address this\ndilemma, we propose HRS, a hybrid representation framework with scheduling\nawareness that integrates numerical and image-based representations to better\ncapture extreme load dynamics.

Therefore, automating the design of SpTA\naccelerators is crucial. Nevertheless, previous works focus solely on either\nmapping (i.e., tiling communication and computation in space and time) or\nsparse strategy (i.e., bypassing zero elements for efficiency), leading to\nsuboptimal designs due to the lack of comprehensive consideration of both. A\nunified framework that jointly optimizes both is urgently needed. However,\nintegrating mapping and sparse strategies leads to a combinatorial explosion in\nthe design space(e.g., as large as $O(10^{41})$ for the workload $P_{32 \\times\n64} \\times Q_{64 \\times 48} = Z_{32 \\times 48}$). This vast search space\nrenders most conventional optimization methods (e.g., particle swarm\noptimization, reinforcement learning and Monte Carlo tree search) inefficient.\nTo address this challenge, we propose an evolution strategy-based sparse tensor\naccelerator optimization framework, called SparseMap. SparseMap constructing a\nmore comprehensive design space with the consideration of both mapping and\nsparse strategy. We introduce a series of enhancements to genetic encoding and\nevolutionary operators, enabling SparseMap to efficiently explore the vast and\ndiverse design space.

In\ncorrupted streams it improves accuracy-drop detection by several AUPRC points\nand maintains strong failure detection (AUROC $\\approx$0.9) in a single pass.\nGrounding uncertainty in layer-to-layer dynamics yields a practical,\nresource-efficient basis for on-device monitoring in TinyML.", "AI": {"tldr": "SNAP-UQ\ub294 TinyML\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub2e8\uc77c \ud1b5\uacfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \ub808\uc774\ube14 \uc5c6\ub294 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c, \uae4a\uc774\ubcc4 \ub2e4\uc74c \ud65c\uc131\ud654 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0\uc11c \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ucd94\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "TinyML\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub7c9\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uac1c\ubc1c\ub428.", "method": "\uc804 \uce35\uc744 \uc555\ucd95\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc74c \uce35\uc758 \ud1b5\uacc4\ub97c \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 Tiny int8 \ud5e4\ub4dc\uc640 \uacbd\ub7c9\uc758 \ub2e8\uc870 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "SNAP-UQ\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ud50c\ub798\uc2dc \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\uc640 \ub300\uae30 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "TinyML \ub514\ubc14\uc774\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc790\uc6d0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uae30\ubc18\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 TinyML\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub2e8\uc77c \ud1b5\uacfc, \ub808\uc774\ube14 \uc5c6\ub294 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 \textbf{SNAP-UQ}\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uae4a\uc774\ubcc4 \ub2e4\uc74c \ud65c\uc131\ud654 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0\uc11c \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ucd94\uc815\ud558\uba70, \uc791\uc740 int8 \ud5e4\ub4dc\ub294 \uc774\uc804 \uce35\uc758 \uc555\ucd95\ub41c \ubdf0\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc74c \uce35\uc758 \ud1b5\uacc4\ub97c \uc608\uce21\ud558\uace0, \uacbd\ub7c9\uc758 \ub2e8\uc870 \ub9e4\ud37c\uac00 \uacb0\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ub180\ub77c\uc6c0\uc744 \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc810\uc218\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc124\uacc4\ub294 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \ubc84\ud37c, \ubcf4\uc870 \uc885\ub8cc \uc9c0\uc810 \ub610\ub294 \ubc18\ubcf5\ub41c\uc21c\ubc29\ud5a5 \ud328\uc2a4\ub97c \uc694\uad6c\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba70, MCU \ubc30\uce58\uc5d0 \uc218\uc2ed \ud0ac\ub85c\ubc14\uc774\ud2b8\ub9cc \ucd94\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ube44\uc804 \ubc0f \uc624\ub514\uc624 \ubc31\ubcf8 \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0, SNAP-UQ\ub294 \uc870\uae30 \uc885\ub8cc \ubc0f \ub525 \uc559\uc0c1\ube14\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ud50c\ub798\uc2dc \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\uc640 \ub300\uae30 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4(\uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc57d 40-60% \ub354 \uc791\uace0 \uc57d 25-35% \ub354 \ube60\ub984), \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc758 \uacbd\uc7c1 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ucd08\uacfc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc190\uc0c1\ub41c \uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9bc\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uac10\uc9c0 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \uc5ec\ub7ec AUPRC \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \ub2e8\uc77c \ud1b5\uacfc\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc2e4\ud328 \uac10\uc9c0(AUROC \uc57d 0.9)\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uce35 \uac04 \uc5ed\ud559\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 TinyML\uc5d0\uc11c \uc628 \ub514\ubc14\uc774\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc790\uc6d0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uae30\ubc18\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Split learning (SL) offers a\npromising solution by offloading the primary computing load from edge devices\nto a server via model partitioning. However, as the number of participating\ndevices increases, the transmission of excessive smashed data (i.e.,\nactivations and gradients) becomes a major bottleneck for SL, slowing down the\nmodel training. To tackle this challenge, we propose a communication-efficient\nSL framework, named SL-ACC, which comprises two key components: adaptive\nchannel importance identification (ACII) and channel grouping compression\n(CGC).

With all features off and bias_correction=``none'', the method is\nexactly Adam.\n  We test on four settings: (i) a Transformer PDE surrogate (Heat2D), (ii) a 3D\nPINN for heat conduction (Heat3D), (iii) a lightweight MLX synthetic task with\njitter and rare-trigger bursts, and (iv) a character-level Transformer on 30 MB\nof enwik8 (small-enwik8). Kourkoutas-Beta improves stability and final loss\nversus fixed-beta2 Adam.

Most previous methods assume that view-specific evidence learning\nis naturally reliable. However, in practice, the evidence learning process\ntends to be biased. Through empirical analysis on real-world data, we reveal\nthat samples tend to be assigned more evidence to support data-rich classes,\nthereby leading to unreliable uncertainty estimation in predictions. This\nmotivates us to delve into a new Biased Evidential Multi-view Learning (BEML)\nproblem. To this end, we propose Fairness-Aware Multi-view Evidential Learning\n(FAML). FAML first introduces an adaptive prior based on training trajectory,\nwhich acts as a regularization strategy to flexibly calibrate the biased\nevidence learning process. Furthermore, we explicitly incorporate a fairness\nconstraint based on class-wise evidence variance to promote balanced evidence\nallocation.

This urgency is reflected in\nemerging global regulations that mandate fairness assessments and independent\nbias audits. However, procuring the necessary complete data for fairness\ntesting remains a significant challenge. In industry settings, legal and\nprivacy concerns restrict the collection of demographic data required to assess\ngroup disparities, and auditors face practical and cultural challenges in\ngaining access to data. In practice, data relevant for fairness testing is\noften split across separate sources: internal datasets held by institutions\nwith predictive attributes, and external public datasets such as census data\ncontaining protected attributes, each providing only partial, marginal\ninformation. Our work seeks to leverage such available separate data to\nestimate model fairness when complete data is inaccessible. We propose\nutilising the available separate data to estimate a set of feasible joint\ndistributions and then compute the set plausible fairness metrics. Through\nsimulation and real experiments, we demonstrate that we can derive meaningful\nbounds on fairness metrics and obtain reliable estimates of the true metric.\nOur results demonstrate that this

However, multivariate time series modeling faces challenges\ndue to data complexity, uncertainty, and frequent regime shifts. Traditional\nevaluation metrics can introduce biases and limit generalization. This work\ncompares two custom evaluation functions: FMAE (Focused Mean Absolute Error),\nfocused on minimizing absolute errors, and HEF (Hierarchical Evaluation\nFunction), designed to weight global metrics and penalize large deviations.\nExperiments were conducted under different data splits (91:9, 80:20, 70:30)\nusing three optimizers (Grid Search, PSO, Optuna), assessing fit, relative\naccuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. Results show that HEF\nconsistently outperforms FMAE in global metrics (R2, Relative Accuracy, RMSE,\nRMSSE), enhancing model robustness and explanatory power. These findings were\nconfirmed via visualizations and statistical tests.

Levine", "Matthew Berger"], "title": "Seeing the Many: Exploring Parameter Distributions Conditioned on Features in Surrogates", "comment": null, "summary": "Recently, neural surrogate models have emerged as a compelling alternative to\ntraditional simulation workflows. This is accomplished by modeling the\nunderlying function of scientific simulations, removing the need to run\nexpensive simulations. Beyond just mapping from input parameter to output,\nsurrogates have also been shown useful for inverse problems: output to input\nparameters. Inverse problems can be understood as search, where we aim to find\nparameters whose surrogate outputs contain a specified feature. Yet finding\nthese parameters can be costly, especially for high-dimensional parameter\nspaces. Thus, existing surrogate-based solutions primarily focus on finding a\nsmall set of matching parameters, in the process overlooking the broader\npicture of plausible parameters. Our work aims to model and visualize the\ndistribution of possible input parameters that produce a given output feature.\nTo achieve this goal, we aim to address two challenges: (1) the approximation\nerror inherent in the surrogate model and (2) forming the parameter\ndistribution in an interactive manner. We model error via density estimation,\nreporting high density only if a given parameter configuration is close to\ntraining parameters, measured both over the input and output space. Our density\nestimate is used to form a prior belief on parameters, and when combined with a\nlikelihood on features, gives us an efficient way to sample plausible parameter\nconfigurations that generate a target output feature. We demonstrate the\nusability of our solution through a visualization interface by performing\nfeature-driven parameter analysis over the input parameter space of three\nsimulation datasets.

By modeling target arrivals as\na mixture of normal and outlier processes, we estimate the probability that a\nnewly observed event is an outlier. We propose a second-order approximation of\nthis probability that incorporates both the mean and variance of the normal\nintensity function, providing improved classification accuracy compared to\nmean-only approaches. We analytically show that our method yields a tighter\nbound to the true probability using Jensen's inequality. To enhance detection,\nwe integrate a real-time, near-optimal sensor placement strategy that\ndynamically adjusts sensor locations based on the evolving outlier intensity.\nThe proposed framework is validated using real ship traffic data near Norfolk,\nVirginia, where numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach\nin improving both classification performance and outlier detection through\nsensor deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud574\uc591 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ud574\uc800 \uc74c\ud5a5 \uc13c\uc11c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc640 \ub85c\uadf8 \uac00\uc6b0\uc2dc\uc548 \ucf55\uc2a4 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uacf5\uac04\uc801 \ucee4\ubbf8\uc158 \uc678\ub9ac\ub97c \ubd84\ub958\ud558\uace0 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud574\uc591 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc678\ub9ac\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \ubd84\ub958\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "\uc815\uc0c1 \uac15\ub3c4 \ud568\uc218\uc758 \ud3c9\uade0\uacfc \ubd84\uc0b0\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \ub450 \ubc88\uc9f8 \ucc28\uc218\uc758 \uadfc\uc0ac\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0 \ud604\uc2e4 \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uc13c\uc11c \ubc30\uce58 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc678\ub9ac \uac15\ub3c4\uac00 \ubcc0\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc13c\uc11c\uc758 \uc704\uce58\ub97c \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub178\ud37d, \ubc84\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc544\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc120\ubc15 \uad50\ud1b5 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c \uac80\uc99d \uacb0\uacfc, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ubd84\ub958 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \uc678\ub9ac \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294\ub370 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ud574\uc591 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc678\ub9ac \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ubc0f \ubd84\ub958\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294\ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uae30\uc5ec\ub97c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud574\uc800 \uc74c\ud5a5 \uc13c\uc11c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc640 \ub85c\uadf8 \uac00\uc6b0\uc2dc\uc548 \ucf55\uc2a4 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4(LGCP)\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud574\uc591 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uacf5\uac04\uc801 \ucee4\ubbf8\uc158 \uc678\ub9ac\ub97c \ubd84\ub958\ud558\uace0 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubaa9\ud45c \ucd9c\ud604\uc744 \uc815\uc0c1 \ubc0f \uc678\ub9ac \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\uc758 \ud63c\ud569\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc0c8\ub85c \uad00\ucc30\ub41c \uc0ac\uac74\uc774 \uc678\ub9ac\uc77c \ud655\ub960\uc744 \ucd94\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc815\uc0c1 \uac15\ub3c4 \ud568\uc218\uc758 \ud3c9\uade0\uacfc \ubd84\uc0b0\uc744 \ubaa8\ub450 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \uc774 \ud655\ub960\uc758 \ub450 \ubc88\uc9f8 \ucc28\uc218 \uadfc\uc0ac\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \ud3c9\uade0\ub9cc \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uac1c\uc120\ub41c \ubd84\ub958 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubd84\uc11d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc60c\uc13c\uc758 \ubd80\ub4f1\uc2dd\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\uc81c \ud655\ub960\uc5d0 \ub354 \ubc00\ucc29\ub41c \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub97c \uac15\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc9c4\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc678\ub9ac \uac15\ub3c4\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc13c\uc11c \uc704\uce58\ub97c \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \uac70\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uc13c\uc11c \ubc30\uce58 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ubc84\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc544\uc8fc \ub178\ud37d \uadfc\ucc98\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc120\ubc15 \uad50\ud1b5 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac80\uc99d\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uc218\uce58 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc13c\uc11c \ubc30\uce58\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ubd84\ub958 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \uc678\ub9ac \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4."}}

Calibration measures\nquantify how far a predictor is from perfect calibration. As introduced by\nHaghtalab et al. (2024), a calibration measure is truthful if it is minimized\nin expectation when a predictor outputs the ground-truth probabilities.\nAlthough predicting the true probabilities guarantees perfect calibration, in\nreality, when calibration is evaluated on a finite sample, predicting the truth\nis not guaranteed to minimize any known calibration measure. All known\ncalibration measures incentivize predictors to lie in order to appear more\ncalibrated on a finite sample. Such lack of truthfulness motivated Haghtalab et\nal. (2024) and Qiao and Zhao (2025) to construct approximately truthful\ncalibration measures in the sequential prediction setting, but no perfectly\ntruthful calibration measure was known to exist even in the more basic batch\nsetting.\n  We design a perfectly truthful calibration measure in the batch setting:\naveraged two-bin calibration error (ATB). In addition to being truthful, ATB is\nsound, complete, continuous, and quadratically related to two existing\ncalibration measures: the smooth calibration error (smCal) and the (lower)\ndistance to calibration (distCal). The simplicity in our definition of ATB\nmakes it efficient and straightforward to compute. ATB allows faster estimation\nalgorithms with significantly easier implementations than smCal and distCal,\nachieving improved running time and simplicity for the calibration testing\nproblem studied by Hu et al. (2024).

The model\nuses channel-agnostic learnable layers where all parameter dimensions are\nindependent of the number of variables. CGPT enforces a CD information flow at\nthe pair-level and CI-like generalization across pairs. This approach\ndisentangles complex system dynamics and results in a highly flexible\narchitecture that ensures scalability and any-variate adaptability. We validate\nCGPT on a suite of synthetic and real-world industrial datasets on long-term\nand one-step forecasting tasks designed to simulate common industrial\ncomplexities. Results demonstrate that CGPT significantly outperforms both CI\nand CD baselines in predictive accuracy and shows competitive performance with\nend-to-end trained CD models while remaining agnostic to the problem\ndimensionality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub2e4\ucc28\uc6d0 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc5d0\uc11c \ucc44\ub110 \uc758\uc874(CD) \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ucc44\ub110 \ub3c5\ub9bd(CI) \ubaa8\ub378 \uac04\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uc774\ub8e8\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc778\uacfc \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc778 Causally-Guided Pairwise Transformer(CGPT)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc0b0\uc5c5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\ucc28\uc6d0 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud560 \ub54c \ucc44\ub110 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uacfc \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "CGPT\ub294 \uc778\uacfc \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c inductive bias\ub85c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uace0, \ub2e4\ucc28\uc6d0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc30d\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "CGPT\ub294 \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4 \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \ucc44\ub110 \ub3c5\ub9bd(CI) \ubc0f \ucc44\ub110 \uc758\uc874(CD) \uae30\uc900\uc744 \ub2a5\uac00\ud558\uba70, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c \ucc28\uc6d0\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc88b\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "CGPT\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\uba70 \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uacfc \ubcc0\ub7c9 \uc801\uc751\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \uc720\uc5f0\ud55c \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc774\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc0b0\uc5c5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\ucc28\uc6d0 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc5d0\ub294 \uc911\uc559 \ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ub4dc\uc624\ud504\uac00 \uc874\uc7ac\ud55c\ub2e4: \ucc44\ub110 \uc758\uc874(CD) \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ud2b9\uc815 \ubcc0\uc218 \uac04\uc758 \uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubaa8\ub378 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\uac00 \ub2e4\ub8e8\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uc0ac\ub840\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubc14\uc778\ub529\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc5b4 \uacac\uace0\uc131\uacfc \uc801\uc751\uc131\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4. \ubc18\uba74\uc5d0 \ucc44\ub110 \ub3c5\ub9bd(CI) \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc608\uce21 \ud68c\uadc0 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uba85\uc2dc\uc801 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \ub300\uac00\ub85c \uc77c\ubc18\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc778\uacfc \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c inductive bias\ub85c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc778 \uc778\uacfc \uc720\ub3c4 \uc30d\ubcc4 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30(CGPT)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

We study whether such\nreasoning can instead emerge from representations that capture both perceptual\nand temporal structure. We show that standard temporal contrastive learning,\ndespite its popularity, often fails to capture temporal structure due to its\nreliance on spurious features. To address this, we introduce Combinatorial\nRepresentations for Temporal Reasoning (CRTR), a method that uses a negative\nsampling scheme to provably remove these spurious features and facilitate\ntemporal reasoning. CRTR achieves strong results on domains with complex\ntemporal structure, such as Sokoban and Rubik's Cube.

Existing studies predominantly focus on the microscopic aspects\nof human trajectories: such as predicting short-term trajectories or the next\nlocation visited, while offering limited attention to macro-level mobility\npatterns and the corresponding life routines. In this paper, we focus on an\nunderexplored problem in human mobility prediction: determining the best\npractices to train a machine learning model using historical data to forecast\nan individuals complete trajectory over the next days and weeks. In this\nexperiment paper, we undertake a comprehensive experimental analysis of diverse\nmodels, parameter configurations, and training strategies, accompanied by an\nin-depth examination of the statistical distribution inherent in human mobility\npatterns. Our empirical evaluations encompass both Long Short-Term Memory and\nTransformer-based architectures, and further investigate how incorporating\nindividual life patterns can enhance the effectiveness of the prediction. We\nshow that explicitly including semantic information such as day-of-the-week and\nuser-specific historical information can help the model better understand\nindividual patterns of life and improve predictions. Moreover, since the\nabsence of explicit user information is often missing due to user privacy, we\nshow that the sampling of users may exacerbate data skewness and result in a\nsubstantial loss in predictive accuracy. To mitigate data imbalance and\npreserve diversity, we apply user semantic clustering with stratified sampling\nto ensure that the sampled dataset remains representative.

However, they suffer from a key discrepancy between\ntraining and inference: during inference, MDLMs progressively reveal the\nstructure of the generated sequence by producing fewer and fewer masked tokens,\nwhereas this structure is ignored in training as tokens are masked at random.\nAlthough this discrepancy between training and inference can lead to suboptimal\nperformance, it has been largely overlooked by previous works, leaving closing\nthis gap between the two stages an open problem. To address this, we frame the\nproblem of learning effective denoising trajectories as a sequential\ndecision-making problem and use the resulting framework to apply reinforcement\nlearning. We propose a novel Masked Diffusion Policy Optimization (MDPO) to\nexploit the Markov property diffusion possesses and explicitly train the model\nunder the same progressive refining schedule used at inference. MDPO matches\nthe performance of the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) method with 60x fewer\ngradient updates, while achieving average improvements of 9.6% on MATH500 and\n54.2% on Countdown over SOTA when trained within the same number of weight\nupdates. Additionally, we improve the remasking strategy of MDLMs as a plug-in\ninference replacement to overcome the limitation that the model cannot refine\ntokens flexibly. This simple yet effective training-free strategy, what we\nrefer to as RCR, consistently improves performance and yields additional gains\nwhen combined with MDPO. Our findings establish great potential for\ninvestigating the discrepancy between pre-training and inference of MDLMs.\nCode: https://github.com/autonomousvision/mdpo.
