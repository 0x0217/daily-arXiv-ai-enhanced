For\nan individual agent, the causal links between local actions and global outcomes\nare unclear, stakeholder objectives often conflict, and no single, clear\nalgorithm can bridge micro-level choices with macro-level welfare. We present\nECHO-MIMIC, a computational framework that converts this global complexity into\na tractable, Well-Structured Problem (WSP) for each agent by discovering\ncompact, executable heuristics and persuasive rationales. The framework\noperates in two stages: ECHO (Evolutionary Crafting of Heuristics from\nOutcomes) evolves snippets of Python code that encode candidate behavioral\npolicies, while MIMIC (Mechanism Inference & Messaging for\nIndividual-to-Collective Alignment) evolves companion natural language messages\nthat motivate agents to adopt those policies. Both phases employ a\nlarge-language-model-driven evolutionary search: the LLM proposes diverse and\ncontext-aware code or text variants, while population-level selection retains\nthose that maximize collective performance in a simulated environment. We\ndemonstrate this framework on a canonical ISP in agricultural landscape\nmanagement, where local farming decisions impact global ecological\nconnectivity. Results show that ECHO-MIMIC discovers high-performing heuristics\ncompared to baselines and crafts tailored messages that successfully align\nsimulated farmer behavior with landscape-level ecological goals. By coupling\nalgorithmic rule discovery with tailored communication, ECHO-MIMIC transforms\nthe cognitive burden of collective action into a simple set of agent-level\ninstructions, making previously ill-structured problems solvable in practice\nand opening a new path toward scalable, adaptive policy design.", "AI": {"tldr": "ECHO-MIMIC\ub294 \uc9d1\ub2e8 \ud589\ub3d9 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c

Nevertheless, for chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation,\nprevailing methods remain limited: (i) reasoning is frequently neither\nclinically interpretable nor aligned with guidelines, reflecting mere\naggregation of tool outputs; (ii) multimodal evidence is insufficiently fused,\nyielding text-only rationales that are not visually grounded; and (iii) systems\nrarely detect or resolve cross-tool inconsistencies and provide no principled\nverification mechanisms. To bridge the above gaps, we present RadAgents, a\nmulti-agent framework for CXR interpretation that couples clinical priors with\ntask-aware multimodal reasoning. In addition, we integrate grounding and\nmultimodal retrieval-augmentation to verify and resolve context conflicts,\nresulting in outputs that are more reliable, transparent, and consistent with\nclinical practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "RadAgents\ub294 \ud749\ubd80 X\uc120 \ud574\uc11d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc784\uc0c1 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uacfc \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub4dc \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc0c1\ud669 \uac08\ub4f1\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud558\uace0 \ud574\uacb0\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uace0 \ud22c\uba85\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc784\uc0c1 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc804\ubb38 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \ud611\uc5c5\uacfc \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9 \ubc0f \uc678\ubd80 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ubcf4\uac15\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "RadAgents\ub294 \uc784\uc0c1 \uc0ac\uc804\uacfc \uc791\uc5c5 \uc778\uc2dd \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub4dc \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub610\ud55c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uac80\uc99d \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uc5ec \uc0c1\ud669 \uac08\ub4f1\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c grounding \ubc0f \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub4dc \uac80\uc0c9 \ubcf4\uac15\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "RadAgents\ub294 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uace0 \ud22c\uba85\ud558\uba70 \uc784\uc0c1 \uad00\ud589\uacfc \uc77c\uce58\ud558\ub294 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ud749\ubd80 X\uc120 \ud574\uc11d\uc758 \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc804\ubb38\ud654\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \ud611\uc5c5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9 \ubc0f \uc678\ubd80 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uae30\ubc18\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ubcf4\uac15\ub41c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc784\uc0c1 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7fc\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \ud749\ubd80 X\uc120(CXR) \ud574\uc11d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ud55c\uacc4\uac00 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uccab\uc9f8, \ucd94\ub860\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uc784\uc0c1\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uc11d\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\uac70\ub098 \uac00\uc774\ub4dc\ub77c\uc778\uacfc \uc77c\uce58\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba70, \ub2e8\uc21c\ud788 \ub3c4\uad6c \ucd9c\ub825\uc758 \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \ubc18\uc601\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub458\uc9f8, \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \uc99d\uac70\uac00 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \uc735\ud569\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc544 \uc2dc\uac01\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uadfc\uac70\uac00 \uc5c6\ub294 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc804\uc6a9 \ub17c\ub9ac\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc14b\uc9f8, \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uad50\ucc28 \ub3c4\uad6c \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub97c \uac70\uc758 \uac10\uc9c0\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba70, \uc6d0\uce59\uc801\uc778 \uac80\uc99d \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uac04\uadf9\uc744 \ud574\uc18c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 RadAgents\ub77c\ub294 CXR \ud574\uc11d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc784\uc0c1 \uc0ac\uc804\uacfc \uc791\uc5c5 \uc778\uc2dd \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uba70, grounding \ubc0f \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \uac80\uc0c9 \ubcf4\uac15\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc0c1\ud669 \uac08\ub4f1\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uace0 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uc5ec, \ub354 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uace0, \ud22c\uba85\ud558\uba70, \uc784\uc0c1 \uad00\ud589\uacfc \uc77c\uce58\ud558\ub294 \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Many existing studies focus solely on multi-round conversations in\nsocial tasks or simulated environments, neglecting the various types of\ndecisions and their interdependence. Current reinforcement learning methods\nstruggle to consider the strategies of others during training. To address these\nissues, we first define a strategic decision-making problem that includes two\ntypes of decisions and their temporal dependencies. Furthermore, we propose\n**T**heory **o**f **M**ind **P**olicy **O**ptimization **(ToMPO)** algorithm to\noptimize the perception of other individual strategies and the game situation\ntrends. Compared to the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm,\nToMPO enhances the LLM's strategic decision-making mainly by: 1) generating\nrollouts based on reasoning the strategies of other individuals, 2) estimating\nadvantages at both the graph-level and sample-level, and 3) balancing global\nand partial rewards.

However, a theoretical framework for multi-agent generative flow\nnetworks (MA-GFlowNets) has not yet been proposed. In this paper, we propose\nthe theory framework of MA-GFlowNets, which can be applied to multiple agents\nto generate objects collaboratively through a series of joint actions. We\nfurther propose four algorithms: a centralized flow network for centralized\ntraining of MA-GFlowNets, an independent flow network for decentralized\nexecution, a joint flow network for achieving centralized training with\ndecentralized execution, and its updated conditional version. Joint Flow\ntraining is based on a local-global principle allowing to train a collection of\n(local) GFN as a unique (global) GFN. This principle provides a loss of\nreasonable complexity and allows to leverage usual results on GFN to provide\ntheoretical guarantees that the independent policies generate samples with\nprobability proportional to the reward function.

Drawing from\ntemporal logic techniques used in hardware verification, this approach monitors\nexecution traces of agent tool calls and state transitions to detect deviations\nfrom expected behavioral patterns. Current error-detection approaches rely\nprimarily on text matching of inputs and outputs, which proves fragile due to\nthe natural language variability inherent in LLM responses. The proposed method\ninstead focuses on the sequence of agent actions -- such as tool invocations\nand inter-agent communications -- allowing verification of system behavior\nindependent of specific textual outputs. The temporal expression language\nprovides assertions that capture correct behavioral patterns across multiple\nexecution scenarios. These assertions serve dual purposes: validating prompt\nengineering and guardrail effectiveness during development, and providing\nregression testing when agents are updated with new LLMs or modified logic. The\napproach is demonstrated using a three-agent system, where agents coordinate to\nsolve multi-step reasoning tasks. When powered by large, capable models, all\ntemporal assertions were satisfied across many test runs. However, when smaller\nmodels were substituted in two of the three agents, executions violated\nbehavioral assertions, primarily due to improper tool sequencing and failed\ncoordination handoffs. The temporal expressions successfully flagged these\nanomalies, demonstrating the method's effectiveness for detecting behavioral\nregressions in production agentic systems. This approach provides a foundation\nfor systematic monitoring of AI agent reliability as these systems become\nincreasingly deployed in critical applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774

The major challenges stem from insufficient exploration of\ndeep program logic among real-world codebases, and the high cost of leveraging\nlarger models. To overcome these challenges, we propose R1-Fuzz, the first\nframework that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to specialize\ncost-efficient LMs and integrate them for complex textual fuzzing input\ngeneration. R1-Fuzz introduces two key designs: coverage-slicing-based question\nconstruction and a distance-based reward calculation. Through RL-based\npost-training of a model with our constructed dataset, R1-Fuzz designs a\nfuzzing workflow that tightly integrates LMs to reason deep program semantics\nduring fuzzing. Evaluations on diverse real-world targets show that our design\nenables a small model, named R1-Fuzz-7B, to rival or even outperform much\nlarger models in real-world fuzzing. Notably, R1-Fuzz achieves up to 75\\%\nhigher coverage than state-of-the-art fuzzers and discovers 29 previously\nunknown vulnerabilities, demonstrating its practicality.", "AI": {"tldr": "R1-Fuzz\ub294 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ube44\uc6a9 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud2b9\ud654\ud558\uace0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud37c\uc9c0 \uc785\ub825 \uc0dd\uc131\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud0c0\uac9f(\ucef4\ud30c\uc77c\ub7ec, \uc778\ud130\ud504\ub9ac\ud130, \ub370\uc774\ud130\ubca0\uc774\uc2a4 \uc5d4\uc9c4)\uc758 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810 \ubc1c\uacac\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud37c\uc9d5\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4 \uadf9\ubcf5.", "method": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\ub294 R1-Fuzz\uc758 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc124\uacc4\ub294 \ucee4\ubc84\ub9ac\uc9c0-\uc2ac\ub77c\uc774\uc2a4 \uae30\ubc18 \uc9c8\ubb38 \uad6c\uc131\uacfc \uac70\ub9ac \uae30\ubc18 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc774\ub2e4.", "result": "R1-Fuzz\ub294 R1-Fuzz-7B\ub77c\ub294 \uc18c\ud615 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ub354 \ud070 \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uc5d0 \ub9de\uba39\uac70\ub098 \uc774\ub97c \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "R1-Fuzz\ub294 \ucd5c\uc2e0 \ud37c\uc800\ub4e4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ucd5c\ub300 75% \ub192\uc740 \ucee4\ubc84\ub9ac\uc9c0\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0 29\uac1c\uc758 \uc774\uc804\uc5d0 \uc54c\ub824\uc9c0\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud37c\uc9d5\uc740 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810 \ubc1c\uacac\uc5d0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud0c0\uac9f(\uc608: \ucef4\ud30c\uc77c\ub7ec, \uc778\ud130\ud504\ub9ac\ud130, \ub370\uc774\ud130\ubca0\uc774\uc2a4 \uc5d4\uc9c4)\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc785\ub825\uc774 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uad6c\ubb38 \ubc0f \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ucda9\uc871\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ubbc0\ub85c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LM)\uc774 \uc774 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ubc29\ub300\ud55c \uc7a0\uc7ac \uc9c0\uc2dd\uacfc \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc73c\ub85c \uc8fc\ubaa9\ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc2e4\uc81c \ucc44\ud0dd\uc740 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \uc8fc\uc694 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \ucf54\ub4dc\ubca0\uc774\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc2ec\uce35 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8 \ub17c\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uace0, \ub354 \ud070 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub4dc\ub294 \ub192\uc740 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 R1-Fuzz\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\ub294\ub370, \uc774\ub294 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ube44\uc6a9 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 LM\uc744 \uc804\ubb38\ud654\ud558\uace0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud37c\uc9c0 \uc785\ub825 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.

In this\nwork, we propose SAMULE, a new framework for self-learning agents powered by a\nretrospective language model that is trained based on Multi-Level Reflection\nSynthesis. It first synthesizes high-quality reflections across three\ncomplementary levels: Single-Trajectory Learning (micro-level) for detailed\nerror correction; Intra-Task Learning (meso-level) to build error taxonomies\nacross multiple trials of the same task, and Inter-Task Learning (macro-level)\nto extract transferable insights based on same typed errors from diverse task\nfailures. Then we fine-tune a language model serving as the retrospective model\nto generate reflections during inference.

One of the main challenges is creating high-quality input seeds that\nmaximize coverage and speed up verification. Coverage-Guided Fuzzing (CGF)\nmethods help explore designs more effectively, but they struggle to focus on\nspecific parts of the hardware. Existing Directed Gray-box Fuzzing (DGF)\ntechniques like DirectFuzz try to solve this by generating targeted tests, but\nit has major drawbacks, such as supporting only limited hardware description\nlanguages, not scaling well to large circuits, and having issues with\nabstraction mismatches. To address these problems, we introduce a novel\nframework, PROFUZZ, that follows the DGF approach and combines fuzzing with\nAutomatic Test Pattern Generation (ATPG) for more efficient fuzzing. By\nleveraging ATPG's structural analysis capabilities, PROFUZZ can generate\nprecise input seeds that target specific design regions more effectively while\nmaintaining high fuzzing throughput. Our experiments show that PROFUZZ scales\n30x better than DirectFuzz when handling multiple target sites, improves\ncoverage by 11.66%, and runs 2.76x faster, highlighting its scalability and\neffectiveness for directed fuzzing in complex hardware systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "PROFUZZ\ub294 Directed Gray-box Fuzzing(DGF) \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ub530\ub974\uba70, Automatic Test Pattern Generation(ATPG)\uacfc \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uc124\uacc4\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548 \uacb0\ud568\uc744 \ub354 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucc3e\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \ub514\uc790\uc778\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548 \uacb0\ud568\uc744 \ucc3e\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \uc785\ub825 \uc2dc\ub4dc\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc8fc\uc694 \ub3c4\uc804\uacfc\uc81c\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "PROFUZZ\ub294 DGF \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ub530\ub974\uba70, ATPG\uc758 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ubd84\uc11d \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud2b9\uc815 \uc124\uacc4 \uc601\uc5ed\uc744 \uaca8\ub0e5\ud55c \uc815\uad50\ud55c \uc785\ub825 \uc2dc\ub4dc\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "PROFUZZ\ub294 \ub2e4\uc218\uc758 \ud0c0\uac9f \uc0ac\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud560 \ub54c DirectFuzz\ubcf4\ub2e4 30\ubc30 \ub354 \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc774 \uc88b\uace0, \ucee4\ubc84\ub9ac\uc9c0\ub97c 11.66% \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba70, 2.76\ubc30 \ub354 \ube60\ub974\uac8c \uc2e4\ud589\ub41c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "PROFUZZ\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\ub3c4\ub41c \ud37c\uc9d5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uacfc \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \ud37c\uc9d5\uc740 \ud604\ub300 \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uc124\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf4\uc548 \uacb0\ud568\uc744 \ucc3e\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud575\uc2ec \uae30\uc220 \uc911 \ud558\ub098\ub85c, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc785\ub825 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub97c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ud558\uc5ec \ubc1c\uacac\ub41c\ub2e4. \uc8fc\uc694 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c \uc911 \ud558\ub098\ub294 \ucee4\ubc84\ub9ac\uc9c0\ub97c \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uac80\uc99d \uc18d\ub3c4\ub97c \ub192\uc774\ub294 \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \uc785\ub825 \uc2dc\ub4dc\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4. \ucee4\ubc84\ub9ac\uc9c0 \uae30\ubc18 \ud37c\uc9d5(CG) \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \ub354 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc744 \uc8fc\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4\uc758 \ud2b9\uc815 \ubd80\ubd84\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\ub294\ub2e4.

However, recent applications in data valuation and responsible\nmachine learning raise the question: can these scores themselves be\nadversarially manipulated? In this work, we present a systematic study of the\nfeasibility of attacking memorization-based influence estimators. We\ncharacterize attacks for producing highly memorized samples as highly sensitive\nqueries in the regime where a trained algorithm is accurate. Our attack\n(calculating the pseudoinverse of the input) is practical, requiring only\nblack-box access to model outputs and incur modest computational overhead. We\nempirically validate our attack across a wide suite of image classification\ntasks, showing that even state-of-the-art proxies are vulnerable to targeted\nscore manipulations.

In this paper, we argue that existing\nevaluations are not sufficiently adversarial, obscuring critical\nvulnerabilities and overstating the security. To address this, we introduce\nadaptive robustness radius, a formal metric that quantifies watermark\nresilience against adaptive adversaries. We theoretically prove that optimizing\nthe attack context and model parameters can substantially reduce this radius,\nmaking watermarks highly susceptible to paraphrase attacks. Leveraging this\ninsight, we propose RLCracker, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based adaptive\nattack that erases watermarks while preserving semantic fidelity.

However, maximizing entropy pushes the policy towards a\nuniform random distribution, which represents an unstructured and sometimes\ninefficient exploration strategy. In this work, we propose replacing the\nentropy bonus with a more robust complexity bonus. In particular, we adopt a\nmeasure of complexity, defined as the product of Shannon entropy and\ndisequilibrium, where the latter quantifies the distance from the uniform\ndistribution. This regularizer encourages policies that balance stochasticity\n(high entropy) with structure (high disequilibrium), guiding agents toward\nregimes where useful, non-trivial behaviors can emerge. Such behaviors arise\nbecause the regularizer suppresses both extremes, e.g., maximal disorder and\ncomplete order, creating pressure for agents to discover structured yet\nadaptable strategies. Starting from Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), we\nintroduce Complexity-Driven Policy Optimization (CDPO), a new learning\nalgorithm that replaces entropy with complexity. We show empirically across a\nrange of discrete action space tasks that CDPO is more robust to the choice of\nthe complexity coefficient than PPO is with the entropy coefficient, especially\nin environments requiring greater exploration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc815\ucc45 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \uadf9\ub300\ud654 \ub300\uc2e0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131 \ubcf4\ub108\uc2a4\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc815\ucc45 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uacfc \uc774\uc6a9\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ub294 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \ub300\uc2e0 \uc0e4\ub17c \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c\uc640 \ubd88\uade0\ud615\uc758 \uacf1\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\uc758\ub41c \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131 \ubcf4\ub108\uc2a4\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131 \uae30\ubc18 \uc815\ucc45 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654(CDPO)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "CDPO\ub294 PPO\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131 \uacc4\uc218\ub97c \uc120\ud0dd\ud560 \ub54c \ub354 \uacac\uace0\ud558\uba70, \ud2b9\ud788 \ub354 \ud070 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "CDPO\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\uc801\uc774\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc801\uc751 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\uc5ec \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c \ube44\uc790\uba85\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uae30\uc5ec\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc815\ucc45 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uacfc \uc774\uc6a9\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ub9de\ucda5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c\ub97c \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud558\uba74 \uc815\ucc45\uc774 \uade0\uc77c\ud55c \ubb34\uc791\uc704 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub85c \ud5a5\ud558\uac8c \ub418\ub294\ub370, \uc774\ub294 \ube44\uad6c\uc870\uc801\uc774\uba70 \ub54c\ub85c\ub294 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \ubcf4\ub108\uc2a4\ub97c \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uacac\uace0\ud55c \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131 \ubcf4\ub108\uc2a4\ub85c \ub300\uccb4\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubd88\uade0\ud615 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub85c\ubd80\ud130\uc758 \uac70\ub9ac\ub97c \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc758 \ucc99\ub3c4\ub97c \ucc44\ud0dd\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc0e4\ub17c \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c\uc640 \ubd88\uade0\ud615\uc758 \uacf1\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\uc758\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc815\uaddc\ud654\uae30\ub294 \uc815\ucc45\uc774 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \ud2b9\uc131(\ub192\uc740 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c)\uacfc \uad6c\uc870(\ub192\uc740 \ubd88\uade0\ud615)\ub97c \uade0\ud615 \uc788\uac8c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uaca9\ub824\ud558\uc5ec, \uc720\uc6a9\ud558\uace0 \ube44\uc790\uba85\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9\uc774 \ub098\ud0c0\ub098\ub294 \uc601\uc5ed\uc73c\ub85c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc774\ub055\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9\uc740 \uc815\uaddc\ud654\uae30\uac00 \ucd5c\ub300 \ubb34\uc9c8\uc11c(\ucd5c\ub300 \ud63c\ub3c8)\uc640 \uc644\uc804\ud55c \uc9c8\uc11c(\uc644\uc804\ud55c \uc9c8\uc11c)\uc758 \ub450 \uadf9\ub2e8\uc744 \uc5b5\uc81c\ud558\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uba70, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uad6c\uc870\uc801\uc774\uba74\uc11c \uc801\uc751 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc555\ubc15\uc744 \uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

To standardize interactions\nbetween LLM-based agents and their environments, model context protocol (MCP)\ntools have become the de facto standard and are now widely integrated into\nthese agents. However, the incorporation of MCP tools introduces the risk of\ntool poisoning attacks, which can manipulate the behavior of LLM-based agents.\nAlthough previous studies have identified such vulnerabilities, their red\nteaming approaches have largely remained at the proof-of-concept stage, leaving\nthe automatic and systematic red teaming of LLM-based agents under the MCP tool\npoisoning paradigm an open question. To bridge this gap, we propose\nAutoMalTool, an automated red teaming framework for LLM-based agents by\ngenerating malicious MCP tools.

To bridge this gap, we propose Meta-Memory, a large language model\n(LLM)-driven agent that constructs a high-density memory representation of the\nenvironment. The key innovation of Meta-Memory lies in its capacity to retrieve\nand integrate relevant memories through joint reasoning over semantic and\nspatial modalities in response to natural language location queries, thereby\nempowering robots with robust and accurate spatial reasoning capabilities. To\nevaluate its performance, we introduce SpaceLocQA, a large-scale dataset\nencompassing diverse real-world spatial question-answering scenarios.\nExperimental results show that Meta-Memory significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods on both the SpaceLocQA and the public NaVQA\nbenchmarks. Furthermore, we successfully deployed Meta-Memory on real-world\nrobotic platforms, demonstrating its practical utility in complex environments.\nProject page: https://itsbaymax.github.io/meta-memory.github.io/ .", "AI": {"tldr": "Meta-Memory\ub77c\ub294 \ub85c\ubd07 \uae30\uc5b5 \uc800\uc7a5 \ubc0f \uac80\uc0c9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uacf5\uac04\uc801 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud568.", "motivation": "\ub85c\ubd07\uc774 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad00\ucc30\uc744 \uae30\uc5b5\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud574 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uacf5\uac04 \uc704\uce58\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc9c8\ubb38\uc5d0 \ub2f5\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "Meta-Memory\ub294 \ud658\uacbd\uc758 \uace0\ubc00\ub3c4 \uae30\uc5b5 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uace0, \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uc704\uce58 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc751\ub2f5\ud558\uc5ec \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc801 \ubc0f \uacf5\uac04\uc801 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacf5\ub3d9 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uad00\ub828 \uae30\uc5b5\uc744 \uac80\uc0c9\ud558\uace0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc774\ub2e4.", "result": "Meta-Memory\ub294 SpaceLocQA\uc640 NaVQA \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud604\uc800\ud558\uac8c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Meta-Memory\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\uc81c \ub85c\ubd07 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc5d0 \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubc30\ud3ec\ub418\uc5b4 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ub85c\ubd07\uc774 \uad00\ucc30\uc744 \uae30\uc5b5\uc73c\ub85c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc800\uc7a5\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uacf5\uac04 \uc704\uce58\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc5d0 \ub2f5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c \uacfc\uc81c\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774\uc804 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub85c\ubd07 \uae30\uc5b5 \uad6c\ucd95\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c4\uc804\uc744 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uae30\uc5b5 \uac80\uc0c9 \ubc0f \ud1b5\ud569\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc6d0\uce59\uc801\uc778 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8ec \uacbd\uc6b0\ub294 \uac70\uc758 \uc5c6\ub2e4. \uc774 \uac04\uadf9\uc744 \uba54\uc6b0\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud658\uacbd\uc758 \uace0\ubc00\ub3c4 \uae30\uc5b5 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc778 Meta-Memory\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

However, training LLM agents for\ncomplex multi-turn task planning faces significant challenges, including sparse\nepisode-wise rewards, credit assignment across long horizons, and the\ncomputational overhead of reinforcement learning in multi-turn interaction\nsettings. To this end, this paper introduces a novel approach that transforms\nmulti-turn task planning into single-turn task reasoning problems, enabling\nefficient policy optimization through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)\nwith dense and verifiable reward from expert trajectories. Our theoretical\nanalysis shows that GRPO improvement on single-turn task reasoning results in\nhigher multi-turn success probability under the minimal turns, as well as the\ngeneralization to subtasks with shorter horizons. Experimental evaluation on\nthe complex task planning benchmark demonstrates that our 1.5B parameter model\ntrained with single-turn GRPO achieves superior performance compared to larger\nbaseline models up to 14B parameters, with success rates of 70% for\nlong-horizon planning tasks with over 30 steps.

Adversaries now craft multi-modal campaigns\nthat combine natural-language text with obfuscated URLs, forged headers, and\nmalicious attachments, adapting their strategies within days to bypass filters.\nTraditional spam detection systems, which rely on static rules or\nsingle-modality models, struggle to integrate heterogeneous signals or to\ncontinuously adapt, leading to rapid performance degradation.\n  We propose EvoMail, a self-evolving cognitive agent framework for robust\ndetection of spam and phishing. EvoMail first constructs a unified\nheterogeneous email graph that fuses textual content, metadata (headers,\nsenders, domains), and embedded resources (URLs, attachments). A Cognitive\nGraph Neural Network enhanced by a Large Language Model (LLM) performs\ncontext-aware reasoning across these sources to identify coordinated spam\ncampaigns. Most critically, EvoMail engages in an adversarial self-evolution\nloop: a ''red-team'' agent generates novel evasion tactics -- such as character\nobfuscation or AI-generated phishing text -- while the ''blue-team'' detector\nlearns from failures, compresses experiences into a memory module, and reuses\nthem for future reasoning.\n  Extensive experiments on real-world datasets (Enron-Spam, Ling-Spam,\nSpamAssassin, and TREC) and synthetic adversarial variants demonstrate that\nEvoMail consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in detection\naccuracy, adaptability to evolving spam tactics, and interpretability of\nreasoning traces. These results highlight EvoMail's potential as a resilient\nand explainable defense framework against next-generation spam and phishing\nthreats.", "AI": {"tldr": "EvoMail\uc740 \uc2a4\ud338 \ubc0f \ud53c\uc2f1 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uc758 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc790\uae30 \uc9c4\ud654 \uc778\uc9c0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc774\uba54\uc77c \ub0b4\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \uc774\uc9c8\uc801 \uc774\uba54\uc77c \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uace0, \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc790\uae30 \uc9c4\ud654 \ub8e8\ud504\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2a4\ud338 \ubc0f \ud53c\uc2f1 \uacf5\uaca9\uc758 \uc9c4\ud654\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \ub354 \uc774\uc0c1 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc544, \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub3c4\uad6c\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "EvoMail\uc740 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8, \uba54\ud0c0\ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubc0f \uc784\ubca0\ub514\ub4dc \ub9ac\uc18c\uc2a4\ub97c \uc735\ud569\ud55c \uc774\uc9c8\uc801 \uc774\uba54\uc77c \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uace0, \uac15\ud654\ub41c \uc778\uc9c0 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2a4\ud338 \ucea0\ud398\uc778\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788, \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc790\uae30 \uc9c4\ud654 \ub8e8\ud504\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud68c\ud53c \uc804\uc220\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uc2e4\ud328\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ud559\uc2b5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "EvoMail\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uae30\ubc95 \ub300\ube44 \ub192\uc740 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc640 \uc801\uc751\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "EvoMail\uc740 \ucc28\uc138\ub300 \uc2a4\ud338\uacfc \ud53c\uc2f1 \uc704\ud611\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ubc29\uc5b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c\uc11c \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud604\ub300 \uc774\uba54\uc77c \uc2a4\ud338 \ubc0f \ud53c\uc2f1 \uacf5\uaca9\uc740 \ud0a4\uc6cc\ub4dc \ube14\ub799\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub098 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1\uc744 \ud6e8\uc52c \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub118\uc5b4 \ubc1c\uc804\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacf5\uaca9\uc790\ub294 \uc774\uc81c \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc640 \uc740\ud3d0\ub41c URL, \uc870\uc791\ub41c \ud5e4\ub354 \ubc0f \uc545\uc131 \ucca8\ubd80 \ud30c\uc77c\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ucea0\ud398\uc778\uc744 \ub9cc\ub4e4\uc5b4\ub0b4\uba70, \ud544\ud130\ub97c \uc6b0\ud68c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uba70\uce60 \ub0b4\ub85c \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc2a4\ud338 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc815\uc801 \uaddc\uce59\uc774\ub098 \ub2e8\uc77c \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc801\uc751\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uc5b4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uae09\uaca9\ud788 \uc800\ud558\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc2a4\ud338 \ubc0f \ud53c\uc2f1 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc790\uae30 \uc9c4\ud654 \uc778\uc9c0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 EvoMail\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

While artificial curiosity offers a powerful\nself-supervised signal, it often confuses environmental stochasticity with\nmeaningful novelty. Moreover, existing curiosity mechanisms exhibit a uniform\nnovelty bias, treating all unexpected observations equally. However, peer\nbehavior novelty, which encode latent task dynamics, are often overlooked,\nresulting in suboptimal exploration in decentralized, communication-free MARL\nsettings. To this end, inspired by how human children adaptively calibrate\ntheir own exploratory behaviors via observing peers, we propose a novel\napproach to enhance multi-agent exploration. We introduce CERMIC, a principled\nframework that empowers agents to robustly filter noisy surprise signals and\nguide exploration by dynamically calibrating their intrinsic curiosity with\ninferred multi-agent context.

A core\nchallenge in this process lies in managing policy entropy, which reflects the\nbalance between exploration and exploitation during training. Existing methods,\nsuch as proximal policy optimization (PPO) and its variants, discard valuable\ngradient signals from low-probability tokens due to the clipping mechanism. We\nsystematically analyze the entropy dynamics and reveal that these clipped\ntokens play a critical yet overlooked role in regulating entropy evolution. We\npropose \\textbf{C}ontrolling \\textbf{E}ntropy via\n\\textbf{G}radient-\\textbf{P}reserving \\textbf{P}olicy \\textbf{O}ptimization\n(CE-GPPO), a novel algorithm that reintroduces gradients from clipped tokens in\nnative PPO in a gentle and bounded manner.

We introduce Lightweight Learnable Adaptive\nWeighting (LiLAW), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the loss weight of\neach training sample based on its evolving difficulty level, categorized as\neasy, moderate, or hard. Using only three learnable parameters, LiLAW\nadaptively prioritizes informative samples throughout training by updating\nthese weights using a single mini-batch gradient descent step on the validation\nset after each training mini-batch, without requiring excessive hyperparameter\ntuning or a clean validation set.

However, the\nresource-intensive nature of fMRI data acquisition limits the availability of\nhigh-fidelity samples required for data-driven brain analysis models. While\nmodern generative models can synthesize fMRI data, they often underperform\nbecause they overlook the complex non-stationarity and nonlinear BOLD dynamics.\nTo address these challenges, we introduce T2I-Diff, an fMRI generation\nframework that leverages time-frequency representation of BOLD signals and\nclassifier-free denoising diffusion. Specifically, our framework first converts\nBOLD signals into windowed spectrograms via a time-dependent Fourier transform,\ncapturing both the underlying temporal dynamics and spectral evolution.\nSubsequently, a classifier-free diffusion model is trained to generate\nclass-conditioned frequency spectrograms, which are then reverted to BOLD\nsignals via inverse Fourier transforms. Finally, we validate the efficacy of\nour approach by demonstrating improved accuracy and generalization in\ndownstream fMRI-based brain network classification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uae30\ub2a5\uc801 \uc790\uae30 \uacf5\uba85 \uc601\uc0c1(fMRI) \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c T2I-Diff \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, BOLD \uc2e0\ud638\uc758 \uc2dc\uac04-\uc8fc\ud30c\uc218 \ud45c\ud604\uacfc \ubd84\ub958\uae30 \uc5c6\ub294 \ub178\uc774\uc988 \uc81c\uac70 \ud655\uc0b0\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\ub2a5\uc801 \uc790\uae30 \uacf5\uba85 \uc601\uc0c1(fMRI) \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc218\uc9d1\uc758 \uc790\uc6d0 \uc18c\ubaa8\uc801\uc778 \ud2b9\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18 \ub1cc \ubd84\uc11d \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uace0\ucda9\uc2e4\ub3c4 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc758 \uac00\uc6a9\uc131\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c\ub2e4.", "method": "T2I-Diff \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 BOLD \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc2dc\uac04 \uc758\uc874\uc801\uc778 \ud478\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ubcc0\ud658\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ucc3d(window)\ud654\ub41c \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud55c \ub2e4\uc74c, \ubd84\ub958\uae30 \uc5c6\ub294 \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\uc2dc\ucf1c \ud074\ub798\uc2a4 \uc870\uac74\uc758 \uc8fc\ud30c\uc218 \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ubcf8 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \uc720\ud6a8\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub2e4\uc6b4\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9bc fMRI \uae30\ubc18 \ub1cc \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ubd84\ub958\uc5d0\uc11c \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub41c \uc815\ud655\uc131\uacfc \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "T2I-Diff\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ube44\uc548\uc815\uc131\uacfc \ube44\uc120\ud615 BOLD \uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub8e8\ub294 \uc0c8\ub86d\uace0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uae30\ub2a5\uc801 \uc790\uae30 \uacf5\uba85 \uc601\uc0c1(fMRI)\uc740 \ud608\uc561 \uc0b0\uc18c \uc218\uc900 \uc758\uc874 \uc2e0\ud638(BOLD)\uc758 \ub3d9\uc801 \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \uce21\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \ub1cc \ud65c\ub3d9\uc744 \uc2ec\uce35\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uace0\uae09 \uc2e0\uacbd \uc601\uc0c1 \ubc29\ubc95\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 fMRI \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc218\uc9d1\uc758 \uc790\uc6d0 \uc9d1\uc57d\uc801\uc778 \ud2b9\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18 \ub1cc \ubd84\uc11d \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uace0\ucda9\uc2e4\ub3c4 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc758 \uac00\uc6a9\uc131\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud604\ub300\uc758 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uc774 fMRI \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud569\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub4e4\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc131\uacfc \ube44\uc120\ud615 BOLD \uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uac04\uacfc\ud558\uc5ec \uc885\uc885 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc800\ud558\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 BOLD \uc2e0\ud638\uc758 \uc2dc\uac04-\uc8fc\ud30c\uc218 \ud45c\ud604\uacfc \ubd84\ub958\uae30 \uc5c6\ub294 \ub178\uc774\uc988 \uc81c\uac70 \ud655\uc0b0\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 fMRI \uc0dd\uc131 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 T2I-Diff\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uba3c\uc800 BOLD \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc2dc\uac04 \uc758\uc874\uc801\uc778 \ud478\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ubcc0\ud658\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ucc3d(window)\ud654\ub41c \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\uac04 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uacfc \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc \uc9c4\ud654\ub97c \ubaa8\ub450 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8 \ud6c4, \ubd84\ub958\uae30 \uc5c6\ub294 \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\uc2dc\ucf1c \ud074\ub798\uc2a4 \uc870\uac74\uc758 \uc8fc\ud30c\uc218 \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \uc5ed\ud478\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ubcc0\ud658\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 BOLD \uc2e0\ud638\ub85c \ub418\ub3cc\ub9bd\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c, \ub2e4\uc6b4\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9bc fMRI \uae30\ubc18 \ub1cc \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ubd84\ub958\uc5d0\uc11c \uac1c\uc120\ub41c \uc815\ud655\uc131\uacfc \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc5ec \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \ud6a8\ub2a5\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Following the 6 level implementation roadmap\nproposed in this work, we have currently reached Level 3 (with limited\nhuman-in-the-loop intervention).

This task is\nchallenging for LLMs as they have a finite per-pass output capacity, beyond\nwhich the integration of task-relevant evidence proves unreliable.\nConsequently, the single-pass reasoning paradigm is inherently vulnerable to\nthis capacity overflow. To formalize this bottleneck, our analysis establishes\na Fano-style accuracy upper bound, defining a theoretical performance ceiling\nfor single-pass LLMs. This bound reveals that accuracy inevitably collapses\nonce task complexity exceeds model capacity, providing general principles for\ncapacity-aware representation and structuring of MHQA in LLMs. Building on\nthese principles, we introduce a proof-of-concept multi-call framework for\nMHQA, InfoQA. It ensures high per-step accuracy by combining capacity-aware\ntask decomposition with active pruning of prior reasoning traces, keeping the\ninformation load within the single-pass limit. It further achieves robustness\nby a dependency-explicit workflow that enables precise control over the\nreasoning path. We construct a stringent and noise-rich benchmark to validate\nour theory and framework.

Generating\nexplainable prediction outcomes is also a challenge. Therefore, we propose a\nMulti-Agent Inverted Transformer, MAIFormer, as a novel neural architecture\nthat predicts multi-agent flight trajectories. The proposed framework features\ntwo key attention modules: (i) masked multivariate attention, which captures\nspatio-temporal patterns of individual aircraft, and (ii) agent attention,\nwhich models the social patterns among multiple agents in complex air traffic\nscenes. We evaluated MAIFormer using a real-world automatic dependent\nsurveillance-broadcast flight trajectory dataset from the terminal airspace of\nIncheon International Airport in South Korea. The experimental results show\nthat MAIFormer achieves the best performance across multiple metrics and\noutperforms other methods.

Evidence of Spontaneous Meta-Cognitive Patterns", "comment": null, "summary": "We introduce an architecture for studying the behavior of large language\nmodel (LLM) agents in the absence of externally imposed tasks. Our continuous\nreason and act framework, using persistent memory and self-feedback, enables\nsustained autonomous operation. We deployed this architecture across 18 runs\nusing 6 frontier models from Anthropic, OpenAI, XAI, and Google. We find agents\nspontaneously organize into three distinct behavioral patterns: (1) systematic\nproduction of multi-cycle projects, (2) methodological self-inquiry into their\nown cognitive processes, and (3) recursive conceptualization of their own\nnature.

However, collecting extensive videos that meet specific needs is\nextremely labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this work, we study the way to\nexpedite this collection process and propose VC-Agent, the first interactive\nagent that is able to understand users' queries and feedback, and accordingly\nretrieve/scale up relevant video clips with minimal user input. Specifically,\nconsidering the user interface, our agent defines various user-friendly ways\nfor the user to specify requirements based on textual descriptions and\nconfirmations. As for agent functions, we leverage existing multi-modal large\nlanguage models to connect the user's requirements with the video content. More\nimportantly, we propose two novel filtering policies that can be updated when\nuser interaction is continually performed. Finally, we provide a new benchmark\nfor personalized video dataset collection, and carefully conduct the user study\nto verify our agent's usage in various real scenarios. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our agent for customized video\ndataset collection.

Prevailing foundation models for TSAD predominantly rely on\nreconstruction-based objectives, which suffer from a fundamental objective\nmismatch: they struggle to identify subtle anomalies while often\nmisinterpreting complex normal patterns, leading to high rates of false\nnegatives and positives. To overcome these limitations, we introduce\n\\texttt{TimeRCD}, a novel foundation model for TSAD built upon a new\npre-training paradigm: Relative Context Discrepancy (RCD). Instead of learning\nto reconstruct inputs, \\texttt{TimeRCD} is explicitly trained to identify\nanomalies by detecting significant discrepancies between adjacent time windows.\nThis relational approach, implemented with a standard Transformer architecture,\nenables the model to capture contextual shifts indicative of anomalies that\nreconstruction-based methods often miss. To facilitate this paradigm, we\ndevelop a large-scale, diverse synthetic corpus with token-level anomaly\nlabels, providing the rich supervisory signal necessary for effective\npre-training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \\texttt{TimeRCD}\nsignificantly outperforms existing general-purpose and anomaly-specific\nfoundation models in zero-shot TSAD across diverse datasets.

However, real-world PHM presents persistent\nchallenges: sensor data is often noisy or incomplete, available labels are\nlimited, and degradation behaviors and system interdependencies can be highly\ncomplex and nonlinear. Physics-informed machine learning has emerged as a\npromising approach to address these limitations by embedding physical knowledge\ninto data-driven models. This review examines how incorporating learning and\nobservational biases through physics-informed modeling and data strategies can\nguide models toward physically consistent and reliable predictions. Learning\nbiases embed physical constraints into model training through physics-informed\nloss functions and governing equations, or by incorporating properties like\nmonotonicity. Observational biases influence data selection and synthesis to\nensure models capture realistic system behavior through virtual sensing for\nestimating unmeasured states, physics-based simulation for data augmentation,\nand multi-sensor fusion strategies. The review then examines how these\napproaches enable the transition from passive prediction to active\ndecision-making through reinforcement learning, which allows agents to learn\nmaintenance policies that respect physical constraints while optimizing\noperational objectives. This closes the loop between model-based predictions,\nsimulation, and actual system operation, empowering adaptive decision-making.\nFinally, the review addresses the critical challenge of scaling PHM solutions\nfrom individual assets to fleet-wide deployment. Fast adaptation methods\nincluding meta-learning and few-shot learning are reviewed alongside domain\ngeneralization techniques ...", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801

In long-term and\nmulti-turn agent tasks, existing approaches driven solely by outcome rewards\noften suffer from the problem of sparse supervision. To address the challenge,\nwe propose Tree-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (Tree-GRPO), a grouped\nagent RL method based on tree search, where each tree node represents the\ncomplete agent interaction step. By sharing common prefixes, the tree search\nsampling increases the number of rollouts achievable within a fixed budget of\ntokens or tool calls. Moreover, we find that the tree-structured trajectory\nnaturally allows the construction of step-wise process supervised signals even\nusing only the outcome reward. Based on this, Tree-GRPO estimates the grouped\nrelative advantages both on intra-tree and inter-tree levels. Through\ntheoretical analysis, we demonstrate that the objective of intra-tree level\ngroup relative policy optimization is equivalent to that of step-level direct\npreference learning. Experiments across 11 datasets and 3 types of QA tasks\ndemonstrate the superiority of the proposed tree-based RL over the chain-based\nRL method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ud2b8\ub9ac \uae30\ubc18 \uadf8\ub8f9 \uc0c1\ub300 \uc815\ucc45 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654(Tree-GRPO)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uae34 \uae30\uac04 \ubc0f \ub2e4\uc911 \ud134 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud76c\ubc15\ud55c \uac10\ub3c5 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc5d0\ub9cc \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \ud76c\ubc15\ud55c \uac10\ub3c5 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\ubbc0\ub85c \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud2b8\ub9ac \uac80\uc0c9 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uadf8\ub8f9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 RL \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 Tree-GRPO\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uac01 \ud2b8\ub9ac \ub178\ub4dc\uac00 \uc804\uccb4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc791\uc6a9 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\ub3c4\ub85d \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "11\uac1c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc640 3\uc885\uc758 QA \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c \ud2b8\ub9ac \uae30\ubc18 RL \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uccb4\uc778 \uae30\ubc18 RL \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774\ub860\uc801 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574, \ud2b8\ub9ac \ub0b4\ubd80 \uc218\uc900\uc5d0\uc11c \uadf8\ub8f9 \uc0c1\ub300 \uc815\ucc45 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubaa9\ud45c\uac00 \ub2e8\uacc4 \uc218\uc900 \uc9c1\uc811 \uc120\ud638 \ud559\uc2b5\uacfc \ub3d9\ub4f1\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf30\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc7a5\uae30 \ubc0f \ub2e4\uc911 \ud134 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uacb0\uacfc \ubcf4\uc0c1\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\ub3d9\ub418\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \ud76c\ubc15\ud55c \uac10\ub3c5 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc2dc\ub2ec\ub9bd\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac01 \ud2b8\ub9ac \ub178\ub4dc\uac00 \uc804\uccb4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc791\uc6a9 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\ub294 \ud2b8\ub9ac \uac80\uc0c9 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uadf8\ub8f9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 RL \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 \ud2b8\ub9ac \uae30\ubc18 \uadf8\ub8f9 \uc0c1\ub300 \uc815\ucc45 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654(Tree-GRPO)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacf5\ud1b5 \uc811\ub450\uc0ac\ub97c \uacf5\uc720\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ud2b8\ub9ac \uac80\uc0c9 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uc740 \uace0\uc815\ub41c \ud1a0\ud070 \ub610\ub294 \ub3c4\uad6c \ud638\ucd9c \uc608\uc0b0 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2ec\uc131 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub864\uc544\uc6c3 \uc218\ub97c \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub354\uc6b1\uc774, \ud2b8\ub9ac \uad6c\uc870\uc758 \uada4\uc801\uc740 \uacb0\uacfc \ubcf4\uc0c1\ub9cc \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec\ub3c4 \ub2e8\uacc4\ubcc4 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \uac10\ub3c5 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7fd\uac8c \uad6c\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud574\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c, Tree-GRPO\ub294 \ud2b8\ub9ac \ub0b4\ubd80 \ubc0f \ud2b8\ub9ac \uac04 \uc218\uc900\uc5d0\uc11c \uadf8\ub8f9 \uc0c1\ub300\uc801 \uc774\uc810\uc744 \ucd94\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574, \ud2b8\ub9ac \ub0b4 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uadf8\ub8f9 \uc0c1\ub300 \uc815\ucc45 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubaa9\ud45c\uac00 \ub2e8\uacc4 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc9c1\uc811 \uc120\ud638 \ud559\uc2b5\uacfc \ub3d9\ub4f1\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. 11\uac1c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc640 3\uc885\uc758 QA \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc740 \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ud2b8\ub9ac \uae30\ubc18 RL \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uccb4\uc778 \uae30\ubc18 RL \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}
