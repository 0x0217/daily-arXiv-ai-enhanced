While social\nlearning transmits innovations between individuals and generations, the\ncognitive processes that generate these innovations remain poorly understood.\nHere, we demonstrate that semantic knowledge-structured associations between\nconcepts and their functions-provides cognitive scaffolding for cumulative\ninnovation by guiding exploration toward plausible and meaningful actions. We\ntested this hypothesis using a cultural evolutionary agent-based model and a\nlarge-scale behavioural experiment (N = 1,243), in which individuals performed\na task requiring the combination of items into novel innovations. Across both\napproaches, semantic knowledge and social learning interact synergistically to\nenhance innovation. Behaviorally, participants without access to semantic\nknowledge performed no better than chance, even when social learning was\navailable, and relied on shallow exploration strategies. These findings suggest\nthat semantic knowledge is a key cognitive process enabling human cumulative\nculture.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubb38\ud654\uc801 \uc9c4\ud654\ub294 \uc778\uac04 \uc0ac\ud68c\uac00 \uc138\ub300\ub97c \uac70\uccd0 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc9c0\uc2dd\uacfc \uae30\uc220\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uac1c\ub150\uacfc \uadf8 \uae30\ub2a5 \uac04\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc801 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uad6c\uc870\uac00 \ub204\uc801 \ud601\uc2e0\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc778\uc9c0\uc801 \uc9c0\uc9c0\ub300 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc778\uac04 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud601\uc2e0\uc774 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud558\uba70, \ud2b9\ud788 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5\uacfc \uc778\uc9c0\uc801 \uacfc\uc815 \uac04\uc758 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uba85\ud655\ud788 \ud558\ub824\ub294 \ubaa9\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubb38\ud654\uc801 \uc9c4\ud654 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc2e4\ud5d8(N=1,243)\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac00\uc124\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc801 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uacfc \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5\uc774 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ud601\uc2e0\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0b4\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc801 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc774 \uc5c6\ub294 \ucc38\uac00\uc790\ub4e4\uc740 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uacbd\uc6b0\uc5d0\ub3c4 \uc6b0\uc5f0\ud55c \uc131\uacfc\uc5d0 \uadf8\ucce4\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc801 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc740 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \ub204\uc801 \ubb38\ud654 \ud615\uc131\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc778\uc9c0\uc801 \uacfc\uc815\uc774\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub204\uc801 \ubb38\ud654 \uc9c4\ud654\ub294 \uc778\uac04 \uc0ac\ud68c\uac00 \uc138\ub300\ub97c \uac70\uccd0 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc9c0\uc2dd\uacfc \uae30\uc220\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud574\uc900\ub2e4. \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \uac1c\uc778\uacfc \uc138\ub300 \uac04\uc758 \ud601\uc2e0\uc744 \uc804\ub2ec\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud601\uc2e0\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc778\uc9c0\uc801 \uacfc\uc815\uc740 \uc544\uc9c1 \uc798 \uc774\ud574\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc5ec\uae30\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac1c\ub150\uacfc \uadf8 \uae30\ub2a5 \uac04\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc801 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc5f0\uad00\uc131\uc774 \ub204\uc801 \ud601\uc2e0\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc778\uc9c0\uc801 \uc9c0\uc9c0\ub300\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc5ec \uadf8 exploration\uc744 \ud569\ub9ac\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc788\ub294 \ud589\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc548\ub0b4\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubb38\ud654\uc801 \uc9c4\ud654 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc2e4\ud5d8(N=1,243)\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 \uac00\uc124\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc774 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c \uac1c\uc778\uc740 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud601\uc2e0\uc73c\ub85c \ud56d\ubaa9\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ub450 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc801 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uacfc \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \ud601\uc2e0\uc744 \uc99d\uc9c4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc791\uc6a9\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ud589\ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc801 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc5d0 \uc811\uadfc\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \ucc38\uac00\uc790\ub4e4\uc740 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uacbd\uc6b0\uc5d0\ub3c4 \uc6b0\uc5f0\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ub0b4\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud588\uc73c\uba70, \uc595\uc740 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uc804\ub7b5\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc801 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc774 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \ub204\uc801 \ubb38\ud654\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc778\uc9c0\uc801 \uacfc\uc815\uc784\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

Code is available at\n  \\url{https://github.com/HankYe/KVCOMM}", "summary": "Multi-agent large language model (LLM) systems are increasingly adopted for\ncomplex language processing tasks that require communication and coordination\namong agents. However, these systems often suffer substantial overhead from\nrepeated reprocessing of overlapping contexts across agents. In typical\npipelines, once an agent receives a message from its predecessor, the full\ncontext-including prior turns-must be reprocessed from scratch, leading to\ninefficient processing. While key-value (KV) caching is an effective solution\nfor avoiding redundant computation in single-agent settings where prefixes\nremain unchanged, it cannot be directly reused in multi-agent scenarios due to\ndiverging prefixes introduced by agent-specific context extensions. We identify\nthat the core challenge lies in the offset variance of KV-caches across agents.\nTo address this, we propose KVCOMM, a training-free framework that enables\nefficient prefilling in multi-agent inference by reusing KV-caches and aligning\ncache offsets of overlapping contexts under diverse prefix contexts. KVCOMM\nestimates and adjusts KV-caches for shared content by referencing a pool of\ncached examples-termed anchors-that store observed cache deviations under\nvarying prefixes. The anchor pool is maintained and updated online, allowing\ndynamic adaptation to distinct user requests and context structures. KVCOMM\nachieves over 70% reuse rate across diverse multi-agent workloads, including\nretrieval-augmented generation, math reasoning, and collaborative coding tasks,\nall without quality degradation. Particularly, when each fully-connected agent\nreceives 1K input tokens with 512 prefix tokens and 512 output tokens under a\nfive-agent setting, KVCOMM achieves up to 7.8x speedup compared to the standard\nprefill pipeline, reducing TTFT from ~430 ms to ~55 ms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uba40\ud2f0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 LLM \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2f1 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c KVCOMM \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uba40\ud2f0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 LLM \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ucc98\ub9ac \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \uc911\ubcf5\ub41c \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc7ac\ucc98\ub9ac\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "KVCOMM\uc740 KV-\uce90\uc2dc\ub97c \uc7ac\ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uace0 \uacb9\uce58\ub294 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc758 \uce90\uc2dc \uc624\ud504\uc14b\uc744 \uc815\ub82c\ud558\uc5ec \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub9ac\ud544\ub9c1\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc5c6\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "KVCOMM\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uba40\ud2f0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c 70% \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9\ub960\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, \ud488\uc9c8 \uc800\ud558 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc18d\ub3c4\ub97c \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "KVCOMM\uc740 5-agent \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ud45c\uc900 \ud504\ub9ac\ud544 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ucd5c\ub300 7.8\ubc30\uc758 \uc18d\ub3c4 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uc774\ub8e8\uba70, TTFT\ub97c \uc57d 430ms\uc5d0\uc11c 55ms\ub85c \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uba40\ud2f0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ucf00\uc774\uc158 \ubc0f \uc870\uc815\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ucc98\ub9ac \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc774 \ucc44\ud0dd\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \uc911\ubcf5\ub41c \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \ubc18\ubcf5\ud558\uc5ec \uc7ac\ucc98\ub9ac\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc774\uc804\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0\ub97c \ubc1b\uc73c\uba74, \uc774\uc804 \ud134\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uc804\uccb4 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\uac00 \ucc98\uc74c\ubd80\ud130 \ub2e4\uc2dc \ucc98\ub9ac\ub418\uc5b4 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ucc98\ub9ac\uac00 \ucd08\ub798\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud0a4-\uac12(KV) \uce90\uc2f1\uc740 \uc811\ub450\uc0ac\uac00 \ubcc0\uacbd\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\ubcf5 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc744 \ud53c\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uace0\uc720\uc758 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud655\uc7a5\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uba40\ud2f0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc9c1\uc811 \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 KV-\uce90\uc2dc\uc758 \uc624\ud504\uc14b \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc774 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec \ubb38\uc81c\uc784\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 KVCOMM\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Many recent works have demonstrated successful attacks leveraging such\nside-channels to extract the confidentiality of diverse applications, such as\nthe key of cryptographic algorithms and the hyperparameter of neural network\nmodels. This paper proposes ShuffleV, a microarchitecture defense strategy\nagainst EM Side-Channel Attacks (SCAs). ShuffleV adopts the moving target\ndefense (MTD) philosophy, by integrating hardware units to randomly shuffle the\nexecution order of program instructions and optionally insert dummy\ninstructions, to nullify the statistical observation by attackers across\nrepetitive runs. We build ShuffleV on the open-source RISC-V core and provide\nsix design options, to suit different application scenarios. To enable rapid\nevaluation, we develop a ShuffleV simulator that can help users to (1) simulate\nthe performance overhead for each design option and (2) generate an execution\ntrace to validate the randomness of execution on their workload. We implement\nShuffleV on a Xilinx PYNQ-Z2 FPGA and validate its performance with two\nrepresentative victim applications against EM SCAs, AES encryption, and neural\nnetwork inference.

At the same time, modern deep\nRL agents are heavily over-parameterized, raising costs and fragility concerns.\nWhile pruning has been shown to improve robustness in supervised learning, its\nrole in adversarial RL remains poorly understood. We develop the first\ntheoretical framework for certified robustness under pruning in\nstate-adversarial Markov decision processes (SA-MDPs). For Gaussian and\ncategorical policies with Lipschitz networks, we prove that element-wise\npruning can only tighten certified robustness bounds; pruning never makes the\npolicy less robust. Building on this, we derive a novel three-term regret\ndecomposition that disentangles clean-task performance, pruning-induced\nperformance loss, and robustness gains, exposing a fundamental\nperformance--robustness frontier. Empirically, we evaluate magnitude and\nmicro-pruning schedules on continuous-control benchmarks with strong\npolicy-aware adversaries. Across tasks, pruning consistently uncovers\nreproducible ``sweet spots'' at moderate sparsity levels, where robustness\nimproves substantially without harming - and sometimes even enhancing - clean\nperformance.

Code and data are available at\n  https://github.com/strongSoda/LITERAL-TO-LIBERAL", "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed as the reasoning\nengines for agentic AI systems, yet they exhibit a critical flaw: a rigid\nadherence to explicit rules that leads to decisions misaligned with human\ncommon sense and intent. This \"rule-rigidity\" is a significant barrier to\nbuilding trustworthy autonomous agents. While prior work has shown that\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) with human explanations can mitigate this issue,\nSFT is computationally expensive and inaccessible to many practitioners. To\naddress this gap, we introduce the Rule-Intent Distinction (RID) Framework, a\nnovel, low-compute meta-prompting technique designed to elicit human-aligned\nexception handling in LLMs in a zero-shot manner. The RID framework provides\nthe model with a structured cognitive schema for deconstructing tasks,\nclassifying rules, weighing conflicting outcomes, and justifying its final\ndecision. We evaluated the RID framework against baseline and Chain-of-Thought\n(CoT) prompting on a custom benchmark of 20 scenarios requiring nuanced\njudgment across diverse domains. Our human-verified results demonstrate that\nthe RID framework significantly improves performance, achieving a 95% Human\nAlignment Score (HAS), compared to 80% for the baseline and 75% for CoT.\nFurthermore, it consistently produces higher-quality, intent-driven reasoning.\nThis work presents a practical, accessible, and effective method for steering\nLLMs from literal instruction-following to liberal, goal-oriented reasoning,\npaving the way for more reliable and pragmatic AI agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 LLM\uc774 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\uc2dd\uacfc \uc758\ub3c4\uc640 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ud558\uac8c \uacb0\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c RID \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM\uc774 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\uc2dd\uacfc \uc758\ub3c4\uc640 \ub9de\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \uacb0\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc9c0\ub294 \uaddc\uce59\uc744 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud788 \ub530\ub974\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc744 \uc778\uc2dd\ud558\uc5ec, \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc720\uc5f0\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ud558\ub294 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc81c\uae30\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "RID \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 LLM\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uac04\uacfc \uc77c\uce58\ud558\ub294 \uc608\uc678 \ucc98\ub9ac\ub97c \uc774\ub04c\uc5b4\ub0b4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc800\ube44\uc6a9 \uba54\ud0c0 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uae30\uc220\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "RID \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uac80\uc99d\ub41c \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, 20\uac1c\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 95%\uc758 \uc778\uac04 \uc815\ub82c \uc810\uc218\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 LLM\uc744 \ubb38\uc790 \uadf8\ub300\ub85c\uc758 \uc9c0\uce68 \uc900\uc218\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa9\ud45c \uc9c0\ud5a5\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\ub044\ub294 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc811\uadfc \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \uc5d4\uc9c4\uc73c\ub85c \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc774 \ubc30\ud3ec\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\uc2dd\uacfc \uc758\ub3c4\uc640 \uc5b4\uae0b\ub098\ub294 \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud558\ub294 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801 \uaddc\uce59\uc758 \uacbd\uc9c1\ub41c \uc900\uc218\ub97c \ubcf4\uc774\ub294 \uc911\ub300\ud55c \uacb0\ud568\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \"\uaddc\uce59 \uacbd\uc9c1\uc131\"\uc740 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc7a5\uc560\ubb3c\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774\uc804 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc124\uba85\uacfc \ud568\uaed8 \uac10\ub3c5\ub41c \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815(SFT)\uc774 \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc644\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, SFT\ub294 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4e4\uace0 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc2e4\ubb34\uc790\uc5d0\uac8c \uc811\uadfc\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub2e4. \uc774 \uac04\uadf9\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c LLM\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uac04\uacfc \uc77c\uce58\ud558\ub294 \uc608\uc678 \ucc98\ub9ac\ub97c \uc774\ub04c\uc5b4\ub0b4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc800\ube44\uc6a9 \uba54\ud0c0 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uae30\uc220\uc778 \uaddc\uce59-\uc758\ub3c4 \uad6c\ubd84(RID) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.

Recently, MARL\nmodels, such as the Multi-Agent Transformer (MAT) and ACtion dEpendent deep\nQ-learning (ACE), have significantly improved performance by leveraging\nsequential decision-making processes. Although these models can enhance\nperformance, they do not explicitly consider the importance of the order in\nwhich agents make decisions. In this paper, we propose an Agent Order of Action\nDecisions-MAT (AOAD-MAT), a novel MAT model that considers the order in which\nagents make decisions. The proposed model explicitly incorporates the sequence\nof action decisions into the learning process, allowing the model to learn and\npredict the optimal order of agent actions. The AOAD-MAT model leverages a\nTransformer-based actor-critic architecture that dynamically adjusts the\nsequence of agent actions. To achieve this, we introduce a novel MARL\narchitecture that cooperates with a subtask focused on predicting the next\nagent to act, integrated into a Proximal Policy Optimization based loss\nfunction to synergistically maximize the advantage of the sequential\ndecision-making. The proposed method was validated through extensive\nexperiments on the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge and Multi-Agent MuJoCo\nbenchmarks. The experimental results show that the proposed AOAD-MAT model\noutperforms existing MAT and other baseline models, demonstrating the\neffectiveness of adjusting the AOAD order in MARL.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud589\ub3d9 \uacb0\uc815 \uc21c\uc11c\ub97c \uace0\ub824\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378 AOAD-MAT\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uae30\uc874 \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc6b0\uc218\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(MARL) \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uc774 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc21c\uc11c\ub97c \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uace0\ub824\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc74c\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc131\ub2a5 \uac1c\uc120\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b4\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "AOAD-MAT\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9 \uacb0\uc815 \uc21c\uc11c\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud574 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc21c\uc11c\ub97c \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \ud601\uc2e0\uc801\uc778 Transformer \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc561\ud130-\ube44\ud3c9\uac00 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c AOAD-MAT \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge \ubc0f Multi-Agent MuJoCo \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uae30\uc874 MAT \ubc0f \ub2e4\ub978 \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uacb0\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c AOAD-MAT \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud589\ub3d9 \uc21c\uc11c\ub97c \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \uacf5\uc720 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uacf5\uc874\ud558\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ud559\uc2b5 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc810\uc744 \ub461\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc Multi-Agent Transformer(MAT) \ubc0f ACtion dEpendent deep Q-learning(ACE)\uacfc \uac19\uc740 MARL \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc21c\ucc28\uc801 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf30\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ub0b4\ub9ac\ub294 \uc21c\uc11c\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uace0\ub824\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uc21c\uc11c\ub97c \uace0\ub824\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 MAT \ubaa8\ub378\uc778 Agent Order of Action Decisions-MAT(AOAD-MAT)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ud559\uc2b5 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0 \ud589\ub3d9 \uacb0\uc815\uc758 \uc21c\uc11c\ub97c \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3ec\ud568\uc2dc\ucf1c \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud589\ub3d9\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801 \uc21c\uc11c\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uace0 \uc608\uce21\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Unlike traditional methods, GRIDAI first assesses\nthe nature of incoming attack samples. If the sample represents a new attack\ntype, it is used to generate a new rule. Otherwise, the sample is identified as\na variant of an attack already covered by an existing rule and used to repair\nthe rule by updating the corresponding signature, thereby enhancing its\ngeneralization capability. Additionally, to mitigate syntactic and semantic\nerrors in rules caused by LLM hallucinations, we incorporate a tool-based\nreal-time validation mechanism and a representative attack sample maintained\nfor each rule, enabling fully automated rule generation and repair.\nComprehensive experiments were conducted on a public dataset containing seven\ntypes of attacks and a private dataset with 43 attack types. The results\ndemonstrate that GRIDAI accurately identifies the relationships between new\nattack samples and existing rules, efficiently generates and repairs rules to\nhandle new attacks and variants, and effectively mitigates the impact of LLM\nhallucinations.", "AI": {"tldr": "GRIDAI\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \ud611\uc5c5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uce68\uc785 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uaddc\uce59\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uc218\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uaddc\uce59 \uae30\ubc18 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uce68\uc785 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uaddc\uce59\uc758 \uc790\ub3d9 \uc0dd\uc131\uc5d0 \uc8fc\ub85c \uc911\uc810\uc744 \ub450\uc5b4 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacf5\uaca9\uacfc \uae30\uc874 \uaddc\uce59 \uac04\uc758 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uac04\uacfc\ud558\uc5ec \uaddc\uce59 \uc138\ud2b8 \ub0b4\uc758 \uc911\ubcf5\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "GRIDAI\ub294 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc758 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0, \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc720\ud615\uc758 \uacf5\uaca9\uc774\uba74 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uaddc\uce59\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uae30\uc874 \uaddc\uce59\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc774\ubbf8 \ub2e4 covered\ub41c \ubcc0\ud615 \uacf5\uaca9\uc774\uba74 \ud574\ub2f9 \uaddc\uce59\uc744 \uc218\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \uc11c\uba85\uc744 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ud558\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, LLM \ud640\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uad6c\ubb38 \ubc0f \uc758\ubbf8 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \uc644\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \uac80\uc99d \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uacfc \uac01 \uaddc\uce59\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub300\ud45c \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "GRIDAI\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc0d8\ud50c\uacfc \uae30\uc874 \uaddc\uce59 \uac04\uc758 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uc815\ud655\ud788 \ud30c\uc545\ud558\uace0, \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacf5\uaca9 \ubc0f \ubcc0\ud615\uc744 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uaddc\uce59\uc744 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131 \ubc0f \uc218\uc815\ud558\uba70, LLM\uc758 \ud640\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8 \uc601\ud5a5 \ub610\ud55c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc644\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "GRIDAI\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uaddc\uce59 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubc0f \uc218\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uce68\uc785 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uaddc\uce59 \uae30\ubc18 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uce68\uc785 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc6f9 \uacf5\uaca9\uc758 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud55c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \uae30\uc874 \uc791\uc5c5\uc740 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uaddc\uce59\uc758 \uc790\ub3d9 \uc0dd\uc131\uc5d0 \uc8fc\ub85c \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uace0, \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacf5\uaca9\uacfc \uae30\uc874 \uaddc\uce59 \uac04\uc758 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uac04\uacfc\ud558\uc5ec \uc810\uc810 \ud655\ub300\ub418\ub294 \uaddc\uce59 \uc138\ud2b8 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\ubcf5\uc131\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uac8c \ub41c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc218\uc758 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \ud611\uc5c5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uce68\uc785 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uaddc\uce59\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uc218\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc5d4\ub4dc \ud22c \uc5d4\ub4dc \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 GRIDAI\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

Existing data-driven framework have\nadvanced perturbation prediction through variational autoencoders, chemically\nconditioned autoencoders, and large-scale transformer pretraining. However,\nthese models are prone to local optima in the nonconvex Waddington landscape of\ncell fate decisions, where poor initialization can trap trajectories in\nspurious lineages or implausible differentiation outcomes. While executable\ngene regulatory networks complement these approaches, automated design\nframeworks incorporate biological priors through multi-agent optimization. Yet,\nan approach that is completely data-driven with well-designed initialization to\nescape local optima and converge to a proper lineage remains elusive. In this\nwork, we introduce a multistage reinforcement learning algorithm tailored for\nsingle-cell perturbation modeling. We first compute an explicit natural\ngradient update using Fisher-vector products and a conjugate gradient solver,\nscaled by a KL trust-region constraint to provide a safe, curvature-aware the\nfirst step for the policy. Starting with these preconditioned parameters, we\nthen apply a second phase of proximal policy optimization (PPO) with clipped\nsurrogates, exploiting minibatch efficiency to refine the policy. We\ndemonstrate that this initialization substantially improves generalization on\nSingle-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and Single-cell ATAC sequencing\n(scATAC-seq) pertubation analysis.", "AI":

However, existing approaches\neither rely on implicit planning in the reasoning stage or introduce explicit\nplanners without systematically addressing how to optimize the planning stage.\nAs evidence, we observe that under vanilla reinforcement learning (RL),\nplanning tokens exhibit significantly higher entropy than other action tokens,\nrevealing uncertain decision points that remain under-optimized. To address\nthis, we propose DeepPlanner, an end-to-end RL framework that effectively\nenhances the planning capabilities of deep research agents. Our approach shapes\ntoken-level advantage with an entropy-based term to allocate larger updates to\nhigh entropy tokens, and selectively upweights sample-level advantages for\nplanning-intensive rollouts.

While recent research has explored\nleveraging model unlearning mechanisms to enhance backdoor concealment,\nexisting attack strategies still leave persistent traces that may be detected\nthrough static analysis. In this work, we introduce the first paradigm of\nrevocable backdoor attacks, where the backdoor can be proactively and\nthoroughly removed after the attack objective is achieved. We formulate the\ntrigger optimization in revocable backdoor attacks as a bilevel optimization\nproblem: by simulating both backdoor injection and unlearning processes, the\ntrigger generator is optimized to achieve a high attack success rate (ASR)\nwhile ensuring that the backdoor can be easily erased through unlearning. To\nmitigate the optimization conflict between injection and removal objectives, we\nemploy a deterministic partition of poisoning and unlearning samples to reduce\nsampling-induced variance, and further apply the Projected Conflicting Gradient\n(PCGrad) technique to resolve the remaining gradient conflicts.

In contrast, coarse-grained idealized models isolate\nfundamental processes and can be precisely calibrated to excel in\ncharacterizing specific dynamical and statistical features. However, different\nmodels remain siloed by disciplinary boundaries. By leveraging the\ncomplementary strengths of models of varying complexity, we develop an\nexplainable AI framework for Earth system emulators. It bridges the model\nhierarchy through a reconfigured latent data assimilation technique, uniquely\nsuited to exploit the sparse output from the idealized models. The resulting\nbridging model inherits the high resolution and comprehensive variables of\noperational models while achieving global accuracy enhancements through\ntargeted improvements from idealized models. Crucially, the mechanism of AI\nprovides a clear rationale for these advancements, moving beyond black-box\ncorrection to physically insightful understanding in a computationally\nefficient framework that enables effective physics-assisted digital twins and\nuncertainty quantification. We demonstrate its power by significantly\ncorrecting biases in CMIP6 simulations of El Ni\\~no spatiotemporal patterns,\nleveraging statistically accurate idealized models.

It then employs a\nmulti-level verification pipeline where (i) at the semantic level, intuitive\nnatural language safety requirements are formalized into TL formulas and the\nLLM agent's understanding of these requirements is probed for alignment with\nthe TL formulas; (ii) at the plan level, high-level action plans and subgoals\ngenerated by the LLM agent are verified against the TL formulas to detect\nunsafe plans before execution; and (iii) at the trajectory level, multiple\nexecution trajectories are merged into a computation tree and efficiently\nverified against physically-detailed TL specifications for a final safety\ncheck. We apply Sentinel in VirtualHome and ALFRED, and formally evaluate\nmultiple LLM-based embodied agents against diverse safety requirements. Our\nexperiments show that by grounding physical safety in temporal logic and\napplying verification methods across multiple levels, Sentinel provides a\nrigorous foundation for systematically evaluating LLM-based embodied agents in\nphysical environments, exposing safety violations overlooked by previous\nmethods and offering insights into their failure modes.", "AI": {"tldr": "Sentinel\uc740 LLM \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uad6c\uccb4\uc801 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \uacf5\uc2dd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \ud3c9\uac00\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc774 \uc8fc\uad00\uc801\uc778 \ud310\ub2e8\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "Sentinel\uc740 \ud615\uc2dd\uc801 \uc2dc\uac04 \ub17c\ub9ac(TL) \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uc548\uc804 \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \uc815\uc758\ud558\uace0, \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uac80\uc99d \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uad6c\uccb4\uc801 \uc548\uc804 \uc870\uac74\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "Sentinel\uc740 VirtualHome\uacfc ALFRED\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5ec\ub7ec LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc600\uace0, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc548\uc804 \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Sentinel\uc740 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \uae30\ubc18\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uc774\uc804 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc774 \uac04\uacfc\ud55c \uc548\uc804 \uc704\ubc18\uc744 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b4\uace0 \uc2e4\ud328 \ubaa8\ub4dc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uad6c\uccb4\uc801 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \uc758\ubbf8\ub860, \uacc4\ud68d \ubc0f \uacbd\ub85c \uc218\uc900\uc5d0\uc11c \uacf5\uc2dd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Sentinel\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc774 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1 \uaddc\uce59\uc774\ub098 \uc8fc\uad00\uc801\uc778 LLM \ud310\ub2e8\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uacfc \ub2ec\ub9ac, Sentinel\uc740 \uc0c1\ud0dc \ubd88\ubcc0, \uc2dc\uac04 \uc885\uc18d\uc131 \ubc0f \ud0c0\uc774\ubc0d \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \uc815\ud655\ud788 \uba85\uc2dc\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud615\uc2dd\uc801 \uc2dc\uac04 \ub17c\ub9ac(TL) \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc5d0 Practical \uc548\uc804 \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc744 \ub450\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7f0 \ub2e4\uc74c (i) \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc801 \uc218\uc900\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c1\uad00\uc801\uc778 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uc548\uc804 \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 TL \uc218\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \ud615\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uace0 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc774 \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc774\ud574\uac00 TL \uc218\uc2dd\uacfc \uc77c\uce58\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uba70;

Existing research has examined users' password management\nstrategies and identified pain points, such as security concerns, leading to\ninsecure practices. We investigate how Blind and Low-Vision (BLV) users tackle\nthis problem and how password managers can assist them. This paper presents the\nresults of a qualitative interview study with N = 33 BLV participants. We found\nthat all participants utilize password managers to some extent, which they\nperceive as fairly accessible. However, the adoption is mainly driven by the\nconvenience of storing and retrieving passwords. The security advantages -\ngenerating strong, random passwords - were avoided mainly due to the absence of\npractical accessibility. Password managers do not adhere to BLV users'\nunderlying needs for agency, which stem from experiences with inaccessible\nsoftware and vendors who deprioritize accessibility issues. Underutilization of\npassword managers leads BLV users to adopt insecure practices, such as reusing\npredictable passwords or resorting to 'security through obscurity' by writing\nimportant credentials in braille. We conclude our analysis by discussing the\nneed to implement practical accessibility and usability improvements for\npassword managers as a way of establishing trust and secure practices

However, time-varying optimization has emerged as an important\nsubject for decision-making in dynamic environments. In this work, we study the\nproblem of learning from streaming data through a time-varying optimization\nlens. Unlike prior works that focus on generic formulations, we introduce a\nstructured, \\emph{weight-based} formulation that explicitly captures the\nstreaming-data origin of the time-varying objective, where at each time step,\nan agent aims to minimize a weighted average loss over all the past data\nsamples. We focus on two specific weighting strategies: (1) uniform weights,\nwhich treat all samples equally, and (2) discounted weights, which\ngeometrically decay the influence of older data. For both schemes, we derive\ntight bounds on the ``tracking error'' (TE), defined as the deviation between\nthe model parameter and the time-varying optimum at a given time step, under\ngradient descent (GD) updates. We show that under uniform weighting, the TE\nvanishes asymptotically with a $\\mathcal{O}(1/t)$ decay rate, whereas\ndiscounted weighting incurs a nonzero error floor controlled by the discount\nfactor and the number of gradient updates performed at each time step. Our\ntheoretical findings are validated through numerical simulations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub3d9\uc801 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2dc\uac04 \ubcc0\ub3d9 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8ec\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2dc\uac04 \ubcc0\ub3d9 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc8fc\uc81c\ub85c \ubd80\uc0c1\ud588\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9ac\ubc0d \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \ud559\uc2b5 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc2dc\uac04 \ubcc0\ub3d9 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \uc811\uadfc\ud558\uba70, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uacf5\uc2dd\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\uade0\uc77c \uac00\uc911\uce58 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ucd94\uc801 \uc624\ucc28\uac00 $\text{O}(1/t)$\uc758 \uac10\uc18c\uc728\ub85c \uc810\uc810 \uc0ac\ub77c\uc9c0\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud560\uc778 \uac00\uc911\uce58 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ube44\uc81c\ub85c\uc758 \uc624\ucc28 \ubc14\ub2e5\uc774 \uc874\uc7ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774\ub860\uc801 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc218\uce58 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uac80\uc99d\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uace0\uc804 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc774\ub860\uc740 \uace0\uc815\ub41c \uc2dc\uac04 \ubd88\ubcc0 \ubaa9\ud45c \ud568\uc218\uc5d0 \ub2e4\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc9d1\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc2dc\uac04 \ubcc0\ub3d9 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc8fc\uc81c\ub85c \ub5a0\uc62c\ub790\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc2dc\uac04 \ubcc0\ub3d9 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9ac\ubc0d \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd98 \uc774\uc804 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc640\ub294 \ub2ec\ub9ac, \uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9ac\ubc0d \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uae30\uc6d0\uc744 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uac00\uc911\uce58 \uae30\ubc18 \uacf5\uc2dd\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec, \uac01 \uc2dc\uac04 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uacfc\uac70 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac00\uc911 \ud3c9\uade0 \uc190\uc2e4\uc744 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 (1) \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \ub3d9\ub4f1\ud558\uac8c \ucde8\uae09\ud558\ub294 \uade0\uc77c \uac00\uc911\uce58\uc640 (2) \uc624\ub798\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uae30\ud558\uae09\uc218\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ud560\uc778 \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub77c\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud2b9\uc815 \uac00\uc911\uce58 \uc804\ub7b5\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubc29\uc548 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uacbd\ub7c9 \ud558\uac15(GD) \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uc8fc\uc5b4\uc9c4 \uc2dc\uac04 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa8\ub378 \ub9e4\uac1c \ubcc0\uc218\uc640 \uc2dc\uac04 \ubcc0\ub3d9 \ucd5c\uc801 \uc0ac\uc774\uc758 \ud3b8\ucc28\ub85c \uc815\uc758\ub41c ``\ucd94\uc801 \uc624\ucc28''(TE)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \uc720\ub3c4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uade0\uc77c \uac00\uc911\uce58 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 TE\uac00 $\text{O}(1/t)$ \uac10\uc18c\uc728\ub85c \uc810\ucc28\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\ub77c\uc9c0\uba70, \ubc18\uba74 \ud560\uc778 \uac00\uc911\uce58 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud560\uc778 \uacc4\uc218\uc640 \uac01 \uc2dc\uac04 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc218\ud589\ub41c \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\uc758 \uc218\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub418\ub294 \ube44\uc81c\ub85c\uc758 \uc624\ucc28 \ubc14\ub2e5\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ubc1c\uacac\uc740 \uc218\uce58 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uac80\uc99d\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Optimizing for a misspecified proxy reward function often\ninduces reward hacking, resulting in a policy misaligned with the human's true\nobjectives. An alternative is to perform RL from human feedback, which involves\nlearning a reward function from scratch by collecting human preferences over\npairs of trajectories. However, building such datasets is costly. To address\nthe limitations of both approaches, we propose Preference-Based Reward Repair\n(PBRR): an automated iterative framework that repairs a human-specified proxy\nreward function by learning an additive, transition-dependent correction term\nfrom preferences. A manually specified reward function can yield policies that\nare highly suboptimal under the ground-truth objective, yet corrections on only\na few transitions may suffice to recover optimal performance. To identify and\ncorrect for those transitions, PBRR uses a targeted exploration strategy and a\nnew preference-learning objective. We prove in tabular domains PBRR has a\ncumulative regret that matches, up to constants, that of prior preference-based\nRL methods. In addition, on a suite of reward-hacking benchmarks, PBRR\nconsistently outperforms baselines that learn a reward function from scratch\nfrom preferences or modify the proxy reward function using other approaches,\nrequiring substantially fewer preferences to learn high performing policies.", "AI": {"tldr": "PBRR(Preference-Based Reward Repair)\ub294 \uc778\uac04\uc774 \uc124\uc815\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc778\uac04 \uc120\ud638\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218\uc758 \uc218\uc815\ud56d\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ubc18\ubcf5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc778\uac04 \uc124\uacc4\uc758 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218\uac00 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc9c4\uc815\ud55c \ubaa9\ud45c\uc640 \uc77c\uce58\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc544 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud574\ud0b9\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "PBRR\ub294 \uc778\uac04 \uc120\ud638\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc804\uc774 \uc758\uc874\uc801\uc778 \uc218\uc815\ud56d\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "PBRR\ub294 \uc774\uc804\uc758 \uc120\ud638 \uae30\ubc18 RL \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec \ub204\uc801 \ud6c4\ud68c\ub97c \uc77c\uce58\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud574\ud0b9 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ub0b8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "PBRR\uc740 \uc0c1\ub300\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc801\uc740 \uc120\ud638\ub85c \ub192\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\uc5ec, \uc778\uac04 \uc815\uc758\uc758 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218\uac00 \ucd5c\uc801\uc774 \uc544\ub2d0 \ub54c\ub3c4 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc778\uac04\uc774 \uc124\uacc4\ud55c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218\ub294 \uc885\uc885 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc9c4\uc815\ud55c, \ube44\uac00\uc2dc\uc801 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc640 \uc77c\uce58\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc544\uc11c \ub2e8\uc9c0 \ub300\ub9ac \uc5ed\ud560\ub9cc \ud558\uac8c \ub41c\ub2e4. \uc798\ubabb \uc9c0\uc815\ub41c \ub300\ub9ac \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud558\uba74 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud574\ud0b9\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\ucc45\uc774 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc9c4\uc815\ud55c \ubaa9\ud45c\uc640 \uc77c\uce58\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uac8c \ub41c\ub2e4. \ub300\uc548\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \uc778\uac04 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 RL\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \uacbd\ub85c \uc30d\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc120\ud638\ub97c \uc218\uc9d1\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \ucc98\uc74c\ubd80\ud130 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4e0\ub2e4. \ub450 \uc811\uadfc\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Preference-Based Reward Repair(PBRR)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4: \uc778\uac04\uc774 \uc9c0\uc815\ud55c \ub300\ub9ac \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \uc218\uc815\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc120\ud638\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ubd80\uac00\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc804\uc774 \uc758\uc874\uc801\uc778 \uc218\uc815\ud56d\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ubc18\ubcf5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4. \uc218\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c0\uc815\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \ubaa9\ud45c \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ube44\ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uba87\uba87 \uc804\uc774\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc218\uc815\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c\ub3c4 \ucd5c\uc801 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ud68c\ubcf5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.

However, existing LLM-based agents exhibit\nsevere limitations in affective cognition: They fail to simulate the bounded\nrationality essential for bridging virtual and real-world services; They lack\nempirically validated integration mechanisms embedding emotions within agent\ndecision architectures. This paper constructs an emotional cognition framework\nincorporating desire generation and objective management, designed to achieve\nemotion alignment between LLM-based agents and humans, modeling the complete\ndecision-making process of LLM-based agents, encompassing state evolution,\ndesire generation, objective optimization, decision generation, and action\nexecution. This study implements the proposed framework within our proprietary\nmulti-agent interaction environment. Experimental results demonstrate that\nagents governed by our framework not only exhibit behaviors congruent with\ntheir emotional states but also, in comparative assessments against other agent\ntypes, demonstrate superior ecological validity and generate decision outcomes\nthat significantly more closely approximate human behavioral patterns.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uac10\uc815 \uc778\uc2dd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc815\uc11c\uc801 \uc778\uc9c0\uac00 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc774\uba70, \uac00\uc0c1\uacfc \uc2e4\uc81c \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uac04\uc758 \uc5f0\uacb0\uc5d0 \ud544\uc694\ud55c bounded rationality\ub97c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc695\uad6c \uc0dd\uc131\uacfc \ubaa9\ud45c \uad00\ub9ac\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \uac10\uc815 \uc778\uc2dd \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uc5ec LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \uc778\uac04 \uac04\uc758 \uac10\uc815 \uc815\ud569\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uad6c\ud604\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uac10\uc815 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc640 \uc77c\uce58\ud558\ub294 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \ub2e4\ub978 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc720\ud615\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud588\uc744 \ub54c \uc0dd\ud0dc\uc801 \ud0c0\ub2f9\uc131\uc774 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub098\uace0 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \uacb0\uacfc\uac00 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9 \ud328\ud134\uacfc \ub354 \ubc00\uc811\ud558\uac8c \uc77c\uce58\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uac10\uc815 \uc778\uc2dd \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uac1c\uc120\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \ucd9c\ud604\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c \uac00\uc0c1 \uc778\uac04\uc744 \ud45c\ud604\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc0ac\ud68c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874\uc758 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc815\uc11c\uc801 \uc778\uc9c0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ubcf4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uadf8\ub4e4\uc740 \uac00\uc0c1 \ubc0f \uc2e4\uc81c \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uac04\uc758 \uc5f0\uacb0\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc778 \ud55c\uc815\ub41c \ud569\ub9ac\uc131\uc744 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uace0, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\u67b6\u69cb \ub0b4\uc5d0 \uac10\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uc2e4\uc99d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\uc99d\ub41c \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc695\uad6c \uc0dd\uc131 \ubc0f \ubaa9\ud45c \uad00\ub9ac\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \uac10\uc815 \uc778\uc9c0 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uc5ec LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \uc778\uac04 \uac04\uc758 \uac10\uc815 \uc815\ud569\uc744 \uc774\ub8e8\uace0, LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc644\uc804\ud55c \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815(\uc0c1\ud0dc \uc9c4\ud654, \uc695\uad6c \uc0dd\uc131, \ubaa9\ud45c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654, \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubc0f \ud589\ub3d9 \uc2e4\ud589)\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uace0\uc720 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uad6c\ud604\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uad00\ub9ac\ub418\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \uc815\uc11c\uc801 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc640 \uc77c\uce58\ud558\ub294 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubcf4\uc77c \ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c, \ub2e4\ub978 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc720\ud615\uacfc \ube44\uad50 \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0dd\ud0dc\uc801 \ud0c0\ub2f9\uc131\uc774 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub098\uace0 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \uacb0\uacfc\uac00 \uc778\uac04 \ud589\ub3d9 \ud328\ud134\uacfc \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \ub354 \ubc00\uc811\ud558\uac8c \uc77c\uce58\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

To achieve completeness -- that is, the\nuniversal approximation property over the space of equivariant functions -- the\nnetwork must effectively capture the intricate multi-body interactions among\ndifferent nodes. Prior methods attain this via deeper architectures, augmented\nbody orders, or increased degrees of steerable features, often at high\ncomputational cost and without polynomial-time solutions. In this work, we\npresent a theoretically grounded framework for constructing complete\nequivariant GNNs that is both efficient and practical. We prove that a complete\nequivariant GNN can be achieved through two key components: 1) a complete\nscalar function, referred to as the canonical form of the geometric graph; and\n2) a full-rank steerable basis set. Leveraging this finding, we propose an\nefficient algorithm for constructing complete equivariant GNNs based on two\ncommon models: EGNN and TFN.

However, CPS often comprise ultra-low-power microcontrollers, whose\nlimited compute resources make training challenging. This paper presents\nRockNet, a new TinyML method tailored for ultra-low-power hardware that\nachieves state-of-the-art accuracy in timeseries classification, such as fault\nor malware detection, without requiring offline pretraining. By leveraging that\nCPS consist of multiple devices, we design a distributed learning method that\nintegrates ML and wireless communication. RockNet leverages all devices for\ndistributed training of specialized compute efficient classifiers that need\nminimal communication overhead for parallelization. Combined with tailored and\nefficient wireless multi-hop communication protocols, our approach overcomes\nthe communication bottleneck that often occurs in distributed learning.\nHardware experiments on a testbed with 20 ultra-low-power devices demonstrate\nRockNet's effectiveness. It successfully learns timeseries classification tasks\nfrom scratch, surpassing the accuracy of the latest approach for neural network\nmicrocontroller training by up to 2x. RockNet's distributed ML architecture\nreduces memory, latency and energy consumption per device by up to 90 % when\nscaling from one central device to 20 devices.

On J-TTL, we find that existing adaptation methods like reflection,\nmemory, or reinforcement learning struggle. To address the challenges posed by\nour benchmark, we present EvoTest, an evolutionary test-time learning framework\nthat improves an agent without any fine-tuning or gradients-by evolving the\nentire agentic system after every episode. EvoTest has two roles: the Actor\nAgent, which plays the game, and the Evolver Agent, which analyzes the episode\ntranscript to propose a revised configuration for the next run. This\nconfiguration rewrites the prompt, updates memory by logging effective\nstate-action choices, tunes hyperparameters, and learns the tool-use routines.\nOn our J-TTL benchmark, EvoTest consistently increases performance,\noutperforming not only reflection and memory-only baselines but also more\ncomplex online fine-tuning methods. Notably, our method is the only one capable\nof winning two games (Detective and Library), while all baselines fail to win\nany.", "AI": {"tldr": "EvoTest\ub294 J-TTL \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud601\uc2e0\uc801\uc778 \uc9c4\ud654\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc801\uc751 \ubc29\uc2dd\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \uae30\ub85d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud604\uc7ac AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uae30\uc220\uc744 \uc989\uc11d\uc5d0\uc11c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "EvoTest\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc774\ub098 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc804\uccb4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc9c4\ud654\uc2dc\ucf1c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \uc9c4\ud654\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "EvoTest\ub294 J-TTL \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf1c \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc801\uc751 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "EvoTest\ub294 \ub450 \uac8c\uc784\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2b9\ub9ac\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc720\uc77c\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c, \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc740 \uc2b9\ub9ac\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud604\uc7ac AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ud55c\uacc4\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc989\uc11d\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uae30\uc220\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c, \uc885\uc885 \"\uc601\ub9ac\ud558\ub098 \ubb34\uc9c0\ud55c \uc778\ud134\"\ucc98\ub7fc \ud589\ub3d9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc774\ub4e4\uc758 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \uc2ec\uac01\ud558\uac8c \uc81c\ud55c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc9c4\ud589 \uc0c1\ud669\uc744 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uce21\uc815\ud558\uace0 \ucd94\uc9c4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uba3c\uc800 Jericho Test-Time Learning (J-TTL) \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Prior research\nhas shown that classifier abstention (allowing a classifier to decline making a\ndecision due to insufficient confidence) can significantly increase classifier\naccuracy. This paper studies abstention within a strategic classification\ncontext, exploring how its introduction impacts strategic agents' responses and\nhow principals should optimally leverage it. We model this interaction as a\nStackelberg game where a principal, acting as the classifier, first announces\nits decision policy, and then strategic agents, acting as followers, manipulate\ntheir features to receive a desired outcome. Here, we focus on binary\nclassifiers where agents manipulate observable features rather than their true\nfeatures, and show that optimal abstention ensures that the principal's utility\n(or loss) is no worse than in a non-abstention setting, even in the presence of\nstrategic agents.

However, models trained by MADRL are vulnerable to adversarial\nperturbations on states and actions. Therefore, it is essential to investigate\nthe robustness of MADRL models from an attack perspective. Existing studies\nfocus on either state-only attacks or action-only attacks, but do not consider\nhow to effectively joint them. Simply combining state and action perturbations\nsuch as randomly perturbing states and actions does not exploit their potential\nsynergistic effects. In this paper, we propose the State-Action Joint Attack\n(SAJA) framework that has a good synergistic effects. SAJA consists of two\nimportant phases: (1) In the state attack phase, a multi-step gradient ascent\nmethod utilizes both the actor network and the critic network to compute an\nadversarial state, and (2) in the action attack phase, based on the perturbed\nstate, a second gradient ascent uses the critic network to craft the final\nadversarial action. Additionally, a heuristic regularizer measuring the\ndistance between the perturbed actions and the original clean ones is added\ninto the loss function to enhance the effectiveness of the critic's guidance.\nWe evaluate SAJA in the Multi-Agent Particle Environment (MPE), demonstrating\nthat (1) it outperforms and is more stealthy than state-only or action-only\nattacks, and (2) existing state or action defense methods cannot defend its\nattacks.", "AI": {"tldr": "SAJA \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2ec\uce35 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacf5\uaca9 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc640 \ud589\ub3d9\uc758 \ud569\ub3d9 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\ub108\uc9c0 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "MADRL \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uad50\ub780\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\ubbc0\ub85c, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uac15\uc778\uc131\uc744 \uacf5\uaca9 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "SAJA \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uc0c1\uc2b9 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \uacc4\uc0b0\ud558\uace0, \uad50\ub780\ub41c \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ucd5c\uc885 \uc801\ub300 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "SAJA\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc785\uc790 \ud658\uacbd(MPE)\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc804\uc6a9 \ub610\ub294 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc804\uc6a9 \uacf5\uaca9\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub098\uace0 \uc740\ubc00\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc0c1\ud0dc \ub610\ub294 \ud589\ub3d9 \ubc29\uc5b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \uc774 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \ubc29\uc5b4\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2ec\uce35 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(MADRL)\uc740 \uc790\uc728 \uc8fc\ud589 \ubc0f \uc804\ub7b5 \uac8c\uc784\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ud611\ub825\uc801 \ubc0f \uacbd\uc7c1\uc801 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 MADRL\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc640 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uad50\ub780\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uacf5\uaca9 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c MADRL \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uac15\uc778\uc131\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc804\uc6a9 \uacf5\uaca9\uc774\ub098 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc804\uc6a9 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0\ub9cc \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uacb0\ud569\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uace0\ub824\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc640 \ud589\ub3d9 \uad50\ub780\uc744 \ubb34\uc791\uc704\ub85c \uacb0\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \uc2dc\ub108\uc9c0 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc88b\uc740 \uc2dc\ub108\uc9c0\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \uc0c1\ud0dc-\ud589\ub3d9 \ud569\ub3d9 \uacf5\uaca9(State-Action Joint Attack, SAJA) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

In contrast to recent proposals within\ncooperative game-theoretical frameworks, we place ourselves in a more general\nframework, based on prediction markets. There, independent agents trade\nforecasts of uncertain future events in exchange for rewards. We introduce and\nanalyse a prediction market that (i) accounts for the historical performance of\nthe agents, (ii) adapts to time-varying conditions, while (iii) permitting\nagents to enter and exit the market at will.

With an eye on long-term\nfutures, we pursue methods that encourage models to produce solutions that\nremain intelligible to weaker collaborators. We formalize intelligibility as\nhandoff robustness: a strong model's solution is intelligible to a weaker model\nif randomly handing off control to the weaker model along the solution path\ndoes not cause failure. Building on this criterion, we introduce tandem\ntraining for language models, a reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm in which\nrollout tokens are intermittently and randomly sampled from a frozen weak model\nrather than the strong model being trained. Because rollouts succeed only when\nthe strong model's actions and reasoning process can be continued by the weak\nmodel -- when the two can co-construct a successful solution -- optimizing\nstandard RL objectives with tandem training implicitly incentivizes both\ncorrectness and intelligibility. In the GSM8K math reasoning task, tandem\ntraining reliably teaches models to abandon jargon and adapt their language to\nweaker partners while keeping task accuracy high.

However, exact computation is\nintractable for systems with more than $\\sim20$ agents due to exponential\ncomplexity $\\mathcal{O}(2^m)$. While Monte Carlo sampling methods provide\nstatistical estimates, they suffer from high sample complexity and cannot\ntransfer knowledge across different network configurations, making them\nimpractical for large-scale or dynamic systems. We present a novel\nlearning-based approach using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to approximate\nBanzhaf values in cardinal network flow games. By framing the problem as a\ngraph-level prediction task, our method learns generalisable patterns of agent\ninfluence directly from network topology and control structure. We conduct a\ncomprehensive empirical study comparing three state-of-the-art GNN\narchitectures-Graph Attention Networks (GAT), Graph Isomorphism Networks with\nEdge features (GINE), and EdgeConv-on a large-scale synthetic dataset of\n200,000 graphs per configuration, varying in size (20-100 nodes), agent count\n(5-20), and edge probability (0.5-1.0). Our results demonstrate that trained\nGNN models achieve high-fidelity Banzhaf value approximation with\norder-of-magnitude speedups compared to exact and sampling-based methods. Most\nsignificantly, we show strong zero-shot generalisation: models trained on\ngraphs of a specific size and topology accurately predict Banzhaf values for\nentirely new networks with different structural properties, without requiring\nretraining. This work establishes GNNs as a practical tool for scalable\ncooperative game-theoretic analysis of complex networked systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911

Additionally, these methods often require costly\nexplicit human feedback to provide a training signal. We propose a new approach\nto tuning assistive language models based on maximizing the human's\nempowerment, their ability to effect desired changes in the environment. Our\nempowerment-maximizing method, Empower, only requires offline text data,\nproviding a self-supervised method for fine-tuning language models to better\nassist humans. To study the efficacy of our approach, we conducted an 18-person\nuser study comparing our empowerment assistant with a strong baseline.\nParticipants preferred our assistant 78% of the time (p=0.015), with a 31%\nhigher acceptance rate and 38% fewer suggestions. Additionally, we introduce a\nnew environment for evaluating multi-turn code assistance using simulated\nhumans. Using this environment, we show that agents trained with Empower\nincrease the success rate of a simulated human programmer on challenging coding\nquestions by an average of 192% over an SFT baseline.

To address these limitations, Short-Wave Infrared (SWIR) imaging\nhas emerged as a promising modality due to its ability to penetrate atmospheric\ndisturbances and differentiate materials with improved clarity. However, the\nadvancement and widespread implementation of SWIR-based systems face\nsignificant hurdles, primarily due to the scarcity of publicly accessible SWIR\ndatasets. In response to this challenge, our research introduces an approach to\nsynthetically generate SWIR-like structural/contrast cues (without claiming\nspectral reproduction) images from existing LWIR data using advanced contrast\nenhancement techniques. We then propose a multimodal fusion framework\nintegrating synthetic SWIR, LWIR, and RGB modalities, employing an optimized\nencoder-decoder neural network architecture with modality-specific encoders and\na softmax-gated fusion head. Comprehensive experiments on public {RGB-LWIR\nbenchmarks (M3FD, TNO, CAMEL, MSRS, RoadScene) and an additional private real\nRGB-MWIR-SWIR dataset} demonstrate that our synthetic-SWIR-enhanced fusion\nframework improves fused-image quality (contrast, edge definition, structural\nfidelity) while maintaining real-time performance. We also add fair trimodal\nbaselines (LP, LatLRR, GFF) and cascaded trimodal variants of\nU2Fusion/SwinFusion under a unified protocol. The outcomes highlight\nsubstantial potential for real-world applications in surveillance and\nautonomous systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uac00\uc2dc\uc131\uc774 \uc88b\uc9c0

In this context, safety is no longer about\nblocking harmful content, but about preempting downstream hazards like\nfinancial or physical harm. Yet, most AI guardrails continue to rely on output\nclassification based on labeled datasets and human-specified criteria,making\nthem brittle to new hazardous situations. Even when unsafe conditions are\nflagged, this detection offers no path to recovery: typically, the AI system\nsimply refuses to act--which is not always a safe choice. In this work, we\nargue that agentic AI safety is fundamentally a sequential decision problem:\nharmful outcomes arise from the AI system's continually evolving interactions\nand their downstream consequences on the world. We formalize this through the\nlens of safety-critical control theory, but within the AI model's latent\nrepresentation of the world. This enables us to build predictive guardrails\nthat (i) monitor an AI system's outputs (actions) in real time and (ii)\nproactively correct risky outputs to safe ones, all in a model-agnostic manner\nso the same guardrail can be wrapped around any AI model. We also offer a\npractical training recipe for computing such guardrails at scale via\nsafety-critical reinforcement learning. Our experiments in simulated driving\nand e-commerce settings demonstrate that control-theoretic guardrails can\nreliably steer LLM agents clear of catastrophic outcomes (from collisions to\nbankruptcy) while preserving task performance, offering a principled dynamic\nalternative to today's flag-and-block guardrails.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 AI

In this work, we present a PINN framework applied to\noncology. Here, we seek to learn time-varying interactions due to a combination\ntherapy in a tumor microenvironment. In oncology, experimental data are often\nsparse and composed of a few time points of tumor volume. By embedding\ninductive biases derived from prior information about a dynamical system, we\nextend the physics-informed neural networks (PINN) and incorporate observed\nbiological constraints as regularization agents. The modified PINN algorithm is\nable to steer itself to a reasonable solution and can generalize well with only\na few training examples.

It is\nwidely used for predictive modelling in fields such as finance, healthcare, and\nengineering. However, traditional methods often struggle with real-world data\ncomplexities, including uncertainty and ambiguity. While deep learning\napproaches excel at capturing complex non-linear relationships, they lack\ninterpretability and risk over-fitting on small datasets. Fuzzy systems provide\nan alternative framework for handling uncertainty and imprecision, with Mamdani\nand Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) systems offering complementary strengths:\ninterpretability versus accuracy. This paper presents a novel fuzzy regression\nmethod that combines the interpretability of Mamdani systems with the precision\nof TSK models. The proposed approach introduces a hybrid rule structure with\nfuzzy and crisp components and dual dominance types, enhancing both accuracy\nand explainability. Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate\nstate-of-the-art performance in several cases, with rules maintaining a\ncomponent similar to traditional Mamdani systems while improving precision\nthrough improved rule outputs. This hybrid methodology offers a balanced and\nversatile tool for predictive modelling, addressing the trade-off between\ninterpretability and accuracy inherent in fuzzy systems. In the 6 datasets\ntested, the proposed approach gave the best fuzzy methodology score in 4\ndatasets, out-performed the opaque models in 2 datasets and produced the best\noverall score in 1 dataset with the improvements in RMSE ranging from 0.4% to\n19%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 Mamdani \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uacfc TSK \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc815\ubc00\uc131\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud37c\uc9c0 \ud68c\uadc0 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ud68c\uadc0 \ubd84\uc11d \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uacfc \ubaa8\ud638\uc131\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud37c\uc9c0\uc640 \uc815\ub7c9\uc801 \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \ud63c\ud569 \uaddc\uce59 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec Mamdani \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uacfc TSK \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc815\ubc00\uc131\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \ud37c\uc9c0 \ud68c\uadc0 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud588\uace0, \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 Mamdani \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uaddc\uce59 \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ud63c\ud569 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc740 \ud37c\uc9c0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uacfc \uc815\ud655\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, 6\uac1c\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8 \uc911 4\uac1c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc0c1\uc758 \ud37c\uc9c0 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \uae30\ub85d\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud68c\uadc0 \ubd84\uc11d\uc740 \uc785\ub825 \ubcc0\uc218\uc640 \uc885\uc18d\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc5f0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ucd9c\ub825 \ubcc0\uc218 \uac04\uc758 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uace0 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uae08\uc735, \uc758\ub8cc \ubc0f \uacf5\ud559\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc608\uce21 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc5d0 \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uacfc \ubaa8\ud638\uc131\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc5d0 \uc885\uc885 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub525 \ub7ec\ub2dd \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ube44\uc120\ud615 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub098\uc9c0\ub9cc \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uace0 \uc791\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uacfc\uc801\ud569 \uc704\ud5d8\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud37c\uc9c0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uacfc \ubd80\uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub300\uc548 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, effective modeling of such data remains challenging due to\nirregular spatial structures, rapid temporal dynamics, and the need to jointly\npredict multiple interrelated physical variables. This paper presents a\nphysics-augmented multi-task Gaussian Process (P-M-GP) framework tailored for\nspatiotemporal dynamic systems. Specifically, we develop a geometry-aware,\nmulti-task Gaussian Process (M-GP) model to effectively capture intrinsic\nspatiotemporal structure and inter-task dependencies.

An emerging solution is to use deep learning models, which offer a\nfaster alternative for climate downscaling.

This paper\nbenchmarks recent state-of-the-art deep learning models and introduces\nphysics-inspired diagnostics to evaluate their performance and reliability,\nwith a particular focus on geographic generalization and physical consistency.\nOur experiments show that, despite the seemingly strong performance of models\nsuch as CorrDiff, when trained on a limited set of European geographies (e.g.,\ncentral Europe), they struggle to generalize to other regions such as Iberia,\nMorocco in the south, or Scandinavia in the north. They also fail to accurately\ncapture second-order variables such as divergence and vorticity derived from\npredicted velocity fields. These deficiencies appear even in in-distribution\ngeographies, indicating challenges in producing physically consistent\npredictions. We propose a simple initial solution: introducing a power spectral\ndensity loss function that empirically improves geographic generalization by\nencouraging the reconstruction of small-scale physical structures.

Even building sufficiently accurate surrogate\nmodels can be extremely challenging with limited high-fidelity data.\nConversely, less expensive, low-fidelity data can be computed more easily and\nencompass a broader range of scenarios. By leveraging multi-fidelity\ninformation, prediction capabilities of surrogates can be improved. However, in\npractical situations, data may be different in types, come from sources of\ndifferent modalities, and not be concurrently available, further complicating\nthe modeling process. To address these challenges, we introduce a progressive\nmulti-fidelity surrogate model. This model can sequentially incorporate diverse\ndata types using tailored encoders. Multi-fidelity regression from the encoded\ninputs to the target quantities of interest is then performed using neural\nnetworks. Input information progressively flows from lower to higher fidelity\nlevels through two sets of connections: concatenations among all the encoded\ninputs, and additive connections among the final outputs. This dual connection\nsystem enables the model to exploit correlations among different datasets while\nensuring that each level makes an additive correction to the previous level\nwithout altering it. This approach prevents performance degradation as new\ninput data are integrated into the model and automatically adapts predictions\nbased on the available inputs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach\non numerical benchmarks and a real-world case study, showing that it reliably\nintegrates multi-modal data and provides accurate predictions,

In order to improve the\nrobustness/defense of RL systems against adversaries, studying various\nadversarial attacks on RL systems is very important. Most previous work\nconsidered deterministic adversarial attack strategies in MDP, which the\nrecipient (victim) agent can defeat by reversing the deterministic attacks. In\nthis paper, we propose a provably ``invincible'' or ``uncounterable'' type of\nadversarial attack on RL. The attackers apply a rate-distortion\ninformation-theoretic approach to randomly change agents' observations of the\ntransition kernel (or other properties) so that the agent gains zero or very\nlimited information about the ground-truth kernel (or other properties) during\nthe training. We derive an information-theoretic lower bound on the recipient\nagent's reward regret and show the impact of rate-distortion attacks on\nstate-of-the-art model-based and model-free algorithms. We also extend this\nnotion of an information-theoretic approach to other types of adversarial\nattack, such as state observation attacks.", "AI": {"tldr": "RL \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ub0b4\uc131\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc720\ud615\uc758 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "RL \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubc29\uc5b4\ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "\uc815\ubcf4 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uad00\ucc30\uc744 \ubb34\uc791\uc704\ub85c \ubcc0\uacbd\ud558\uc5ec \ucd5c\uace0\uc758 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc9c0\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc8fc\uc5b4\uc9c4 \uc815\ubcf4\uc758 \uc800\ud558\uac00 RL \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud6c4\ud68c\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc815\ub7c9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc5ec, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc0f \ube44\ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacf5\uaca9\uc758 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uacf5\uaca9 \uc804\ub7b5\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc9c4\uc2e4\uc758 \ucee4\ub110\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uac70\uc758 \uc5bb\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec, RL \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548\uc744 \uc800\ud558\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uae30\ubc95\uc774\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc5d0\uc11c \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815(MDP)\uc740 \uc790\uc728\uc8fc\ud589, \uc7ac\ubb34 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815, \ub4dc\ub860/\ub85c\ubd07 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ub9ce\uc740 \ubcf4\uc548 \uad00\ub828 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0\uc11c \ub4f1\uc7a5\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c RL \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uac15\uac74\uc131/\ubc29\uc5b4\ub825\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \uc774\uc804 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc218\uc2e0\uc790(\ud53c\ud574\uc790) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uacb0\uc815\ub860\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \uc5ed\uc804\uc2dc\ud0b4\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uce60 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uacb0\uc815\ub860\uc801 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 RL\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c '\ubb34\uc801' \ub610\ub294 '\ubc18\uaca9\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294' \uc720\ud615\uc758 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uacf5\uaca9\uc790\ub294 \ube44\uc728-\uc65c\uace1 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc911\uc5d0 \uc9c4\uc2e4\uc758 \ucee4\ub110\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4\uac00 \uac70\uc758 \uc5c6\uac70\ub098 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc5bb\ub3c4\ub85d \uc804\uc774 \ucee4\ub110(\ub610\ub294 \ub2e4\ub978 \uc18d\uc131)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uad00\ucc30\uc744 \ubb34\uc791\uc704\ub85c \ubcc0\uacbd\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc218\uc2e0\uc790 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud6c4\ud68c\uc758 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ud558\ud55c\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uace0, \ucca8\ub2e8 \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc0f \ube44\ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ube44\uc728-\uc65c\uace1 \uacf5\uaca9\uc758 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub610\ud55c \uc0c1\ud0dc \uad00\ucc30 \uacf5\uaca9\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ub2e4\ub978 \uc720\ud615\uc758 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \ud655\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4."}}
