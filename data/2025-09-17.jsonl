This expressivity and richness\ncome at a cost: ABMs can typically be analyzed only through simulation, making\ntheir analysis challenging. Specifically, when studying the output of ABMs, the\nanalyst is often confronted with practical questions such as: (i) how many\nindependent replications should be run? (ii) how many initial time steps should\nbe discarded as a warm-up? (iii) after the warm-up, how long should the model\nrun? (iv) what are the right parameter values? Analysts usually resort to rules\nof thumb and experimentation, which lack statistical rigor. This is mainly\nbecause addressing these points takes time, and analysts prefer to spend their\nlimited time improving the model. In this paper, we propose a methodology,\ndrawing on the field of Statistical Model Checking, to automate the process and\nprovide guarantees of statistical rigor for ABMs written in NetLogo, one of the\nmost popular ABM platforms. We discuss MultiVeStA, a tool that dramatically\nreduces the time and human intervention needed to run statistically rigorous\nchecks on ABM outputs, and introduce its integration with NetLogo. Using two\nABMs from the NetLogo library, we showcase MultiVeStA's analysis capabilities\nfor NetLogo ABMs, as well as a novel application to statistically rigorous\ncalibration. Our tool-chain makes it immediate to perform statistical checks\nwith NetLogo models, promoting more rigorous and reliable analyses of ABM\noutputs."}

In response, the\nsecurity community has developed highly accurate detection systems able to\ndetermine if a website is fraudulent.

In this\npaper, we present LOKI, a system designed to identify search engine queries\nlikely to return a high fraction of fraudulent websites. LOKI implements a\nkeyword scoring model grounded in Learning Under Privileged Information (LUPI)\nand feature distillation from Search Engine Result Pages (SERPs). We rigorously\nvalidate LOKI across 10 major scam categories and demonstrate a 20.58 times\nimprovement in discovery over both heuristic and data-driven baselines across\nall categories.

However, it remains a\nprevailing challenge due to the stochastic nature of urban traffic and\nenvironmental factors. Better predictions require models capable of\naccommodating the traffic variability influenced by multiple dynamic and\ncomplex interdependent factors. In this work, we propose a Graph Neural Network\n(GNN) framework to address the stochasticity by leveraging adaptive adjacency\nmatrices using log-normal distributions and Coefficient of Variation (CV)\nvalues to reflect real-world travel time variability. Additionally, weather\nfactors such as temperature, wind speed, and precipitation adjust edge weights\nand enable GNN to capture evolving spatio-temporal dependencies across traffic\nstations. This enhancement over the static adjacency matrix allows the model to\nadapt effectively to traffic stochasticity and changing environmental\nconditions. Furthermore, we utilize the Adaptive Conformal Prediction (ACP)\nframework to provide reliable uncertainty quantification, achieving target\ncoverage while maintaining acceptable prediction intervals. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that the proposed model, in comparison with baseline\nmethods, showed better prediction accuracy and uncertainty bounds. We, then,\nvalidate this method by constructing traffic scenarios in SUMO and applying\nMonte-Carlo simulation to derive a travel time distribution for a Vehicle Under\nTest (VUT) to reflect real-world variability. The simulated mean travel time of\nthe VUT falls within the intervals defined by INRIX historical data, verifying\nthe model's robustness."}

During each rollout process, we preserve the original\nmodel output within the multi-turn dialogue, where a Patch Module adaptively\nrecovers the divergence between rollout and expert trajectories. To capture\nlong-term training signals, Semi-online RL introduces discounted future returns\ninto the reward computation and optimizes the policy with weighted step-level\nand episode-level advantages. We further introduce Semi-Online Performance\n(SOP), a metric that aligns better with true online performance, serving as a\npractical and effective proxy for real-world evaluation. Experiments show that\nours Semi-online RL achieves SOTA performance among 7B models across four\ndynamic benchmarks, with significant gains over the base model (e.g., +12.0% on\nAndroidWorld, +23.8% on AITW), demonstrating significant progress in bridging\nthe gap between offline training efficiency and online multi-turn reasoning.\nThe code is available at https://github.com/X-PLUG/MobileAgent/tree/main/UI-S1."}

Current\nframeworks for multi-agent debate are often designed towards tool use, lack\nintegrated evaluation, or provide limited configurability of agent personas,\nresponse generators, discussion paradigms, and decision protocols. We introduce\nMALLM (Multi-Agent Large Language Models), an open-source framework that\nenables systematic analysis of MAD components. MALLM offers more than 144\nunique configurations of MAD, including (1) agent personas (e.g., Expert,\nPersonality), (2) response generators (e.g., Critical, Reasoning), (3)\ndiscussion paradigms (e.g., Memory, Relay), and (4) decision protocols (e.g.,\nVoting, Consensus). MALLM uses simple configuration files to define a debate.\nFurthermore, MALLM can load any textual Huggingface dataset (e.g., MMLU-Pro,\nWinoGrande) and provides an evaluation pipeline for easy comparison of MAD\nconfigurations. MALLM is tailored towards researchers and provides a window\ninto the heart of multi-agent debate, facilitating the understanding of its\ncomponents and their interplay."}

However, IRL is\ninherently ill-posed: multiple reward functions, forming the so-called feasible\nset, can explain the same observed behavior. Since these rewards may induce\ndifferent policies in the new setting, in the absence of additional\ninformation, a decision criterion is needed to select which policy to deploy.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel, principled criterion that selects the\n\"average\" policy among those induced by the rewards in a certain bounded subset\nof the feasible set. Remarkably, we show that this policy can be obtained by\nplanning with the reward centroid of that subset, for which we derive a\nclosed-form expression. We then present a provably efficient algorithm for\nestimating this centroid using an offline dataset of expert demonstrations\nonly. Finally, we conduct numerical simulations that illustrate the\nrelationship between the expert's behavior and the behavior produced by our\nmethod."}

Unlike standard IL, our goal is not only\nto train an agent that matches the expert's expected return (i.e., its average\nperformance) but also its risk attitude (i.e., other features of the return\ndistribution, such as variance). We propose a general formulation of the\nrisk-sensitive IL problem in which the objective is to match the expert's\nreturn distribution in Wasserstein distance. We focus on the tabular setting\nand assume the expert's reward is known. After demonstrating the limited\nexpressivity of Markovian policies for this task, we introduce an efficient and\nsufficiently expressive subclass of non-Markovian policies tailored to it.\nBuilding on this subclass, we develop two provably efficient algorithms, RS-BC\nand RS-KT, for solving the problem when the transition model is unknown and\nknown, respectively. We show that RS-KT achieves substantially lower sample\ncomplexity than RS-BC by exploiting dynamics information. We further\ndemonstrate the sample efficiency of return distribution matching in the\nsetting where the expert's reward is unknown by designing an oracle-based\nvariant of RS-KT. Finally, we complement our theoretical analysis of RS-KT and\nRS-BC with numerical simulations, highlighting both their sample efficiency and\nthe advantages of non-Markovian policies over standard sample-efficient IL\nalgorithms."}
