The adjustable hard settings of such systems require a flexible soft planning mechanism that enables realtime production planning and scheduling amid the existing complexity and variability in their configuration settings. This study explores the application of multi agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for dynamic scheduling in soft planning of the RMS settings. In the proposed framework, deep Qnetwork (DQN) agents trained in centralized training learn optimal job machine assignments in real time while adapting to stochastic events such as machine breakdowns and reconfiguration delays. The model also incorporates a negotiation with an attention mechanism to enhance state representation and improve decision focus on critical system features. Key DQN enhancements including prioritized experience replay, nstep returns, double DQN and soft target update are used to stabilize and accelerate learning. Experiments conducted in a simulated RMS environment demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms baseline heuristics in reducing makespan and tardiness while improving machine utilization. The reconfigurable manufacturing environment was extended to simulate realistic challenges, including machine failures and reconfiguration times. Experimental results show that while the enhanced DQN agent is effective in adapting to dynamic conditions, machine breakdowns increase variability in key performance metrics such as makespan, throughput, and total tardiness. The results confirm the advantages of applying the MARL mechanism for intelligent and adaptive scheduling in dynamic reconfigurable manufacturing environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774

However, traditional credit assignment schemes in MARL cannot reliably capture individual contributions in strongly coupled tasks while maintaining training stability, which leads to limited generalization capabilities and hinders algorithm performance. To address these challenges, we propose a Historical Interaction-Enhanced Shapley Policy Gradient Algorithm (HIS) for Multi-Agent Credit Assignment, which employs a hybrid credit assignment mechanism to balance base rewards with individual contribution incentives. By utilizing historical interaction data to calculate the Shapley value in a sample-efficient manner, HIS enhances the agent's ability to perceive its own contribution, while retaining the global reward to maintain training stability. Additionally, we provide theoretical guarantees for the hybrid credit assignment mechanism, ensuring that the assignment results it generates are both efficient and stable.

A Controlled Study of Multi-Agent Debate in Logical Reasoning", "comment": "20 pages, 6 figures", "summary": "Multi-agent debate (MAD) has recently emerged as a promising framework for improving the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs). Yet, whether LLM agents can genuinely engage in deliberative reasoning, beyond simple ensembling or majority voting, remains unclear. We address this question through a controlled study using the Knight--Knave--Spy logic puzzle, which enables precise, step-wise evaluation of debate outcomes and processes under verifiable ground truth. We systematically set up six structural and cognitive factors, including agent team size, composition, confidence visibility, debate order, debate depth, and task difficulty, to disentangle their respective effects on collective reasoning. Our results show that intrinsic reasoning strength and group diversity are the dominant drivers of debate success, while structural parameters such as order or confidence visibility offer limited gains. Beyond outcomes, process-level analyses identify key behavioral patterns: majority pressure suppresses independent correction, effective teams overturn incorrect consensus, and rational, validity-aligned reasoning most strongly predicts improvement. These findings provide valuable insights into how and why LLM debates succeed or fail, offering guidance for designing interpretable and truth-seeking multi-agent reasoning systems.", "AI": {"tldr":

Rethinking Agent Risk under Intent Concealment and Task Complexity", "comment": null, "summary": "Current safety evaluations for LLM-driven agents primarily focus on atomic harms, failing to address sophisticated threats where malicious intent is concealed or diluted within complex tasks. We address this gap with a two-dimensional analysis of agent safety brittleness under the orthogonal pressures of intent concealment and task complexity. To enable this, we introduce OASIS (Orthogonal Agent Safety Inquiry Suite), a hierarchical benchmark with fine-grained annotations and a high-fidelity simulation sandbox. Our findings reveal two critical phenomena: safety alignment degrades sharply and predictably as intent becomes obscured, and a \"Complexity Paradox\" emerges, where agents seem safer on harder tasks only due to capability limitations. By releasing OASIS and its simulation environment, we provide a principled foundation for probing and strengthening agent safety in these overlooked dimensions.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131 \ud3c9\uac00\uac00 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc704\ud611\uc744 \uc81c\ub300\ub85c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, OASIS\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc640 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud604\uc7ac LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131 \ud3c9\uac00\ub294 \uc8fc\ub85c \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \ud574\uc545\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uace0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5 \ub0b4\uc5d0 \uc228\uaca8\uc9c4 \uc545\uc758\uc801 \uc758\ub3c4\ub97c \uace0\ub824\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc758\ub3c4 \uc228\uae40\uacfc \uc791\uc5c5 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc758 \uc9c1\uad50\uc801 \uc555\ub825 \uc544\ub798\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc758 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 OASIS\ub77c\ub294 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc640 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uc0cc\ub4dc\ubc15\uc2a4\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc758\ub3c4\uac00 \ubd88\uba85\ud655\ud574\uc9c8\uc218\ub85d \uc548\uc804 \uc815\ub82c\uc774 \uae09\uaca9\ud788 \uc800\ud558\ub418\uace0, \ub354 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ub354 \uc548\uc804\ud574 \ubcf4\uc774\ub294 '\ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131 \uc5ed\uc124' \ud604\uc0c1\uc774 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "OASIS\uc640 \uadf8 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \ucd9c\uc2dc\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uac04\uacfc\ub41c \uc548\uc804\uc131 \uce21\uba74\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \uac15\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc6d0\uce59\uc801\uc778 \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud604\uc7ac LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc548\uc804\uc131 \ud3c9\uac00\ub294 \uc8fc\ub85c \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \ud574\uc545\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uba70, \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5 \ub0b4\uc5d0 \uc228\uaca8\uc9c4 \uc545\uc758\uc801 \uc758\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc758\ub3c4 \uc228\uae40\uacfc \uc791\uc5c5 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc758 \uc9c1\uad50\uc801 \uc555\ub825 \uc544\ub798 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc758 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\ub294 \uc774\uc911 \ucc28\uc6d0 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc138\ubc00\ud55c \uc8fc\uc11d\uacfc \uace0\ucda9\uc2e4\ub3c4 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uc0cc\ub4dc\ubc15\uc2a4\ub97c \uac16\ucd98 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc778 OASIS(Orthogonal Agent Safety Inquiry Suite)\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc1c\uacac\uc740 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b8\ub2e4: \uc758\ub3c4\uac00 \ubd88\uba85\ud655\ud574\uc9d0\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc548\uc804 \uc815\ub82c\uc774 \uae09\uaca9\ud558\uace0 \uc608\uce21 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \uc800\ud558\ub418\uba70, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ub354 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub354 \uc548\uc804\ud574 \ubcf4\uc774\ub294 \u2018\ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131 \uc5ed\uc124\u2019\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud55c\ub2e4.

The system leverages four specialized agents that work together to generate contextually appropriate educational content. Experimental validation on platforms including Raspberry Pi 4B and NVIDIA Jetson Nano demonstrates significant performance achievements. InkubaLM on Jetson Nano achieved a Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) of 129 ms, an average inter-token latency of 33 ms, and a throughput of 45.2 tokens per second while consuming 8.4 W. On Raspberry Pi 4B, InkubaLM also led with 326 ms TTFT and 15.9 tokens per second at 5.8 W power consumption. The framework consistently delivered high multilingual quality, averaging a BLEU score of 0.688, cultural relevance of 4.4/5, and fluency of 4.2/5 across tested African languages. Through potential partnerships with active community organizations including African Youth & Community Organization (AYCO) and Florida Africa Foundation, this research aims to establish a practical foundation for accessible, localized, and sustainable AI-driven education in resource-constrained environments. Keeping focus on long-term viability and cultural appropriateness, it contributes to United Nations SDGs 4, 9, and 10.

Although AI agents' privacy policies may describe their intended data practices, there remains limited transparency and accountability about whether runtime behavior matches those policies. To close this gap, we introduce AudAgent, a visual framework that continuously monitors AI agents' data practices in real time and guards compliance with stated privacy policies.\n  AudAgent consists of four components for automated privacy auditing of AI agents. (i) Policy parsing: an ensemble of LLMs translates natural-language privacy policies into a structured privacy-policy model, where cross-LLM voting guarantees confidence of the parsing results. (ii) Runtime annotation: a lightweight Presidio-based analyzer detects sensitive data and annotates how the data is used based on the context of the AI agent's operations and the privacy-policy model. (iii) Compliance auditing: ontology alignment and automata-based evaluation connect the policy model with runtime annotations, enabling on-the-fly compliance checks between the natural-language policy and observed unordered data practices of AI agents. (iv) User interface: a platform-independent implementation visualizes the real-time execution trace of AI agents along with potential privacy risks detected during auditing, providing user-friendly transparency and accountability.\n  In addition to common formatted privacy policies, AudAgent also supports user-defined policies for fine-grained control and customization.

Infrequent categories, often characterized by sparse samples, suffer from high label inconsistency, which undermines classification performance. LEVER mitigates this problem by adopting a robust Siamese-style architecture, leveraging knowledge transfer to reduce label inconsistency and enhance the performance of One-vs-All classifiers. Comprehensive testing across multiple XC datasets reveals substantial improvements in the handling of infrequent categories, setting a new benchmark for the field.

Our core finding is that when the behavior policy is factorized - a common scenario where agents act fully or partially independently during data collection - a strategy of partial action replacement (PAR) can significantly mitigate this challenge. PAR updates a single or part of agents' actions while the others remain fixed to the behavioral data, reducing distribution shift compared to full joint-action updates. Based on this insight, we develop Soft-Partial Conservative Q-Learning (SPaCQL), using PAR to mitigate OOD issue and dynamically weighting different PAR strategies based on the uncertainty of value estimation. We provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for this approach, proving that under factorized behavior policies, the induced distribution shift scales linearly with the number of deviating agents rather than exponentially with the joint-action space.

Despite research showing that domain-dependent, procedural knowledge can dramatically increase planning efficiency, little work evaluates its potential for improving LLM performance on agentic tasks that may require implicit planning. We formalize, implement, and evaluate an agentic LLM workflow that leverages procedural knowledge in the form of a hierarchical task network (HTN). Empirical results of our implementation show that hand-coded HTNs can dramatically improve LLM performance on agentic tasks, and using HTNs can boost a 20b or 70b parameter LLM to outperform a much larger 120b parameter LLM baseline. Furthermore, LLM-created HTNs improve overall performance, though less so. The results suggest that leveraging expertise--from humans, documents, or LLMs--to curate procedural knowledge will become another important tool for improving LLM workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc9c0\uc6d0, \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\ub9c1 \ub610\ub294 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud560 \ub54c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\ub294\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc808\ucc28\uc801 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 LLM \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\ub97c \uc124\uacc4, \uad6c\ud604 \ubc0f \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 LLM \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc808\ucc28\uc801 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uc5f0\uad6c\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc791\uc5c5 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c(HTN)\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 LLM \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\ub97c \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uad6c\ud604\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc218\uce58 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc218\uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c HTN\uc774 LLM\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uadf9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc804\ubb38 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc808\ucc28\uc801 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc120\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 LLM \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c\uac00 \ub420 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc9c0\uc6d0, \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\ub9c1 \ub610\ub294 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud560 \ub54c \uc885\uc885 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc758\uc874\uc801\uc778 \uc808\ucc28\uc801 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc774 \uacc4\ud68d \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uadf9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub192\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uc5f0\uad6c \uacb0\uacfc\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \uc554\ubb35\uc801 \uacc4\ud68d\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c LLM \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uac70\uc758 \uc5c6\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc791\uc5c5 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c(HTN) \ud615\uc2dd\uc758 \uc808\ucc28\uc801 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 LLM \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\ub97c \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654, \uad6c\ud604 \ubc0f \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uad6c\ud604 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc218\uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\uc131\ub41c HTN\uc774 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c LLM \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uadf9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, HTN\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uba74 20b \ub610\ub294 70b \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 LLM\uc774 \ub354 \ud070 120b \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 LLM \uae30\uc900\uce58\ub97c \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. furthermore, LLM\uc774 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c HTN\ub3c4 \uc804\uccb4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uadf8 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub294 \ub35c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc778\uac04, \ubb38\uc11c \ub610\ub294 LLM\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc804\ubb38 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc808\ucc28\uc801 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc120\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 LLM \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc5d0 \ub610 \ub2e4\ub978 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c\uac00 \ub420 \uac83\uc784\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

This work explores the use of language models (LMs) for the generation of synthetic genetic mutation profiles, leveraging differential privacy (DP) for the protection of sensitive genetic data. We empirically evaluate the privacy guarantees of our DP modes by introducing a novel Biologically-Informed Hybrid Membership Inference Attack (biHMIA), which combines traditional black box MIA with contextual genomics metrics for enhanced attack power. Our experiments show that both small and large transformer GPT-like models are viable synthetic variant generators for small-scale genomics, and that our hybrid attack leads, on average, to higher adversarial success compared to traditional metric-based MIAs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc720\uc804 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uc99d\uac00\ub41c \uac00\uc6a9\uc131\uc740 \uc720\uc804\uccb4 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ubcc0\ud654\uc2dc\ucf30\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \ud2b9\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ucc98\ub9ac\uc640 \uad00\ub828\ub41c \uc5ec\ub7ec \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc57c\uae30\ud588\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc720\uc804\uc801 \ubcc0\uc774 \ud504\ub85c\ud544 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uace0, \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \uc720\uc804 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ucc28\ubcc4 \uac1c\uc778\uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc720\uc804 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ubbfc\uac10\uc131 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \ube14\ub799 \ubc15\uc2a4 \ud68c\uc6d0 \ucd94\uc815 \uacf5\uaca9(MIA)\uacfc \ub9e5\ub77d\uc801 \uc720\uc804\uccb4 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\ubcf4\ud654\ub41c \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \ud68c\uc6d0 \ucd94\uc815 \uacf5\uaca9(biHMIA)\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc791\uc740 \uaddc\ubaa8\uc640 \ud070 \uaddc\ubaa8\uc758 GPT \uc720\uc0ac \ubcc0\ud658\uae30 \ubaa8\ub378 \ubaa8\ub450\uac00 \uc18c\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc720\uc804\uccb4\uc758 \ud569\uc131 \ubcc0\ud615 \uc0dd\uc131\uae30\ub85c\uc11c \uc801\ud569\ud558\uba70, \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uacf5\uaca9\uc740 \ud3c9\uade0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad \uae30\ubc18 MIA\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc131\uacf5\uc744 \uc774\ub04c\uc5b4\ub0b8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud65c\uc6a9\uc774 \uc720\uc804\uc790 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \ud569\uc131 \uc720\uc804 \ubcc0\uc774\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc720\uc804 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uac00\uc6a9\uc131 \uc99d\ub300\ub294 \uc720\uc804\uccb4 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ubcc0\ud654\uc2dc\ucf30\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \ud2b9\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ucde8\uae09\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ub41c \ub9ce\uc740 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ubd88\ub7ec\uc77c\uc73c\ucf30\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \uc720\uc804 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubcf4\ud638\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \ucc28\ubcc4\uc801 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc(DP)\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud569\uc131 \uc720\uc804 \ubcc0\uc774 \ud504\ub85c\ud544 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LM)\uc758 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ube14\ub799 \ubc15\uc2a4 MIA\uc640 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc801 \uc720\uc804\uccb4 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uacf5\uaca9\ub825\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\ubcf4\ud654\ub41c \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \ud68c\uc6d0 \ucd94\uc815 \uacf5\uaca9(biHMIA)\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 DP \ubaa8\ub4dc\uc758 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc791\uc740 \uaddc\ubaa8 \ubc0f \ud070 \uaddc\ubaa8\uc758 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30 GPT \uc720\uc0ac \ubaa8\ub378 \ubaa8\ub450\uac00 \uc18c\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc720\uc804\uccb4\uc758 \ud569\uc131 \ubcc0\ud615 \uc0dd\uc131\uae30\ub85c \uc801\ud569\ud558\uba70, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uacf5\uaca9\uc740 \ud3c9\uade0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad \uae30\ubc18 MIA\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4."}}

We focus on robust constrained Markov decision processes (RCMDPs), where the agent must maximize reward while ensuring cumulative utility exceeds a threshold under the worst-case dynamics within an uncertainty set. While recent works have established finite-time iteration complexity guarantees for RCMDPs using policy optimization, their sample complexity guarantees remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we first show that Markovian policies may fail to be optimal even under rectangular uncertainty sets unlike the {\\em unconstrained} robust MDP. To address this, we introduce an augmented state space that incorporates the remaining utility budget into the state representation. Building on this formulation, we propose a novel Robust constrained Value iteration (RCVI) algorithm with a sample complexity of $\\mathcal{\\tilde{O}}(|S||A|H^5/\u03b5^2)$ achieving at most $\u03b5$ violation using a generative model where $|S|$ and $|A|$ denote the sizes of the state and action spaces, respectively, and $H$ is the episode length.

However, FL does not natively consider infrastructure efficiency, a critical concern for systems operating in resource-constrained environments. Several Reinforcement Learning (RL) based solutions offer improved client selection for FL; however, they do not consider infrastructure challenges, such as resource limitations and device churn. Furthermore, the training of RL methods is often not designed for practical application, as these approaches frequently do not consider generalizability and are not optimized for energy efficiency. To fill this gap, we propose BIPPO (Budget-aware Independent Proximal Policy Optimization), which is an energy-efficient multi-agent RL solution that improves performance. We evaluate BIPPO on two image classification tasks run in a highly budget-constrained setting, with FL clients training on non-IID data, a challenging context for vanilla FL.

Current solutions, which have evolved from retrieval using semantic embeddings to more sophisticated structured knowledge graphs representations for improved sense-making and associativity, are tailored for fact-based retrieval and fail to build the space-time-anchored narrative representations required for tracking entities through episodic events. To bridge this gap, we propose the \\textbf{Generative Semantic Workspace} (GSW), a neuro-inspired generative memory framework that builds structured, interpretable representations of evolving situations, enabling LLMs to reason over evolving roles, actions, and spatiotemporal contexts. Our framework comprises an \\textit{Operator}, which maps incoming observations to intermediate semantic structures, and a \\textit{Reconciler}, which integrates these into a persistent workspace that enforces temporal, spatial, and logical coherence. On the Episodic Memory Benchmark (EpBench) \\cite{huet_episodic_2025} comprising corpora ranging from 100k to 1M tokens in length, GSW outperforms existing RAG based baselines by up to \\textbf{20\\%}. Furthermore, GSW is highly efficient, reducing query-time context tokens by \\textbf{51\\%} compared to the next most token-efficient baseline, reducing inference time costs considerably.

Code is available at https://github.com/Hecateto/FedRW", "summary": "Data duplication within large-scale corpora often impedes large language models' (LLMs) performance and privacy. In privacy-concerned federated learning scenarios, conventional deduplication methods typically rely on trusted third parties to perform uniform deletion, risking loss of informative samples while introducing privacy vulnerabilities. To address these gaps, we propose Federated ReWeighting (FedRW), the first privacy-preserving framework, to the best of our knowledge, that performs soft deduplication via sample reweighting instead of deletion in federated LLM training, without assuming a trusted third party. At its core, FedRW proposes a secure, frequency-aware reweighting protocol through secure multi-party computation, coupled with a parallel orchestration strategy to ensure efficiency and scalability. During training, FedRW utilizes an adaptive reweighting mechanism with global sample frequencies to adjust individual loss contributions, effectively improving generalization and robustness. Empirical results demonstrate that FedRW outperforms the state-of-the-art method by achieving up to 28.78x speedup in preprocessing and approximately 11.42% improvement in perplexity, while offering enhanced security guarantees.

SciAgent organizes problem solving as a hierarchical process: a Coordinator Agent interprets each problem's domain and complexity, dynamically orchestrating specialized Worker Systems, each composed of interacting reasoning Sub-agents for symbolic deduction, conceptual modeling, numerical computation, and verification. These agents collaboratively assemble and refine reasoning pipelines tailored to each task. Across mathematics and physics Olympiads (IMO, IMC, IPhO, CPhO), SciAgent consistently attains or surpasses human gold-medalist performance, demonstrating both domain generality and reasoning adaptability. Additionally, SciAgent has been tested on the International Chemistry Olympiad (IChO) and selected problems from the Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) benchmark, further confirming the system's ability to generalize across diverse scientific domains.

Sekhon"], "title": "AIA Forecaster: Technical Report", "comment": null, "summary": "This technical report describes the AIA Forecaster, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based system for judgmental forecasting using unstructured data. The AIA Forecaster approach combines three core elements: agentic search over high-quality news sources, a supervisor agent that reconciles disparate forecasts for the same event, and a set of statistical calibration techniques to counter behavioral biases in large language models. On the ForecastBench benchmark (Karger et al., 2024), the AIA Forecaster achieves performance equal to human superforecasters, surpassing prior LLM baselines. In addition to reporting on ForecastBench, we also introduce a more challenging forecasting benchmark sourced from liquid prediction markets.

These leaky thoughts occur when models inadvertently expose sensitive details in their reasoning traces, even when final outputs appear safe. The challenge lies in preventing such leakage without compromising the model's reasoning capabilities, requiring a delicate balance between privacy and utility. We introduce Steering Activations towards Leakage-free Thinking (SALT), a lightweight test-time intervention that mitigates privacy leakage in model's Chain of Thought (CoT) by injecting targeted steering vectors into hidden state. We identify the high-leakage layers responsible for this behavior. Through experiments across multiple LLMs, we demonstrate that SALT achieves reductions including $18.2\\%$ reduction in CPL on QwQ-32B, $17.9\\%$ reduction in CPL on Llama-3.1-8B, and $31.2\\%$ reduction in CPL on Deepseek in contextual privacy leakage dataset AirGapAgent-R while maintaining comparable task performance and utility.

Traditional SPICE simulations are time-consuming, while existing machine learning methods often require topology-specific retraining or manual substructure segmentation for fine-tuning, hindering scalability and adaptability. In this work, we propose ZeroSim, a transformer-based performance modeling framework designed to achieve robust in-distribution generalization across trained topologies under novel parameter configurations and zero-shot generalization to unseen topologies without any fine-tuning. We apply three key enabling strategies: (1) a diverse training corpus of 3.6 million instances covering over 60 amplifier topologies, (2) unified topology embeddings leveraging global-aware tokens and hierarchical attention to robustly generalize to novel circuits, and (3) a topology-conditioned parameter mapping approach that maintains consistent structural representations independent of parameter variations. Our experimental results demonstrate that ZeroSim significantly outperforms baseline models such as multilayer perceptrons, graph neural networks and transformers, delivering accurate zero-shot predictions across different amplifier topologies. Additionally, when integrated into a reinforcement learning-based parameter optimization pipeline, ZeroSim achieves a remarkable speedup (13x) compared to conventional SPICE simulations, underscoring its practical value for a wide range of analog circuit design automation tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "ZeroSim\uc740 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1

It requires the integration of several capabilities, including multi-step reasoning, cross-document synthesis, and the generation of evidence-backed, long-form answers. Evaluating DR remains challenging because responses are lengthy and diverse, admit many valid solutions, and often depend on dynamic information sources. We introduce ResearchRubrics, a standardized benchmark for DR built with over 2,800+ hours of human labor that pairs realistic, domain-diverse prompts with 2,500+ expert-written, fine-grained rubrics to assess factual grounding, reasoning soundness, and clarity. We also propose a new complexity framework for categorizing DR tasks along three axes: conceptual breadth, logical nesting, and exploration. In addition, we develop human and model-based evaluation protocols that measure rubric adherence for DR agents. We evaluate several state-of-the-art DR systems and find that even leading agents like Gemini's DR and OpenAI's DR achieve under 68% average compliance with our rubrics, primarily due to missed implicit context and inadequate reasoning about retrieved information. Our results highlight the need for robust, scalable assessment of deep research capabilities, to which end we release ResearchRubrics(including all prompts, rubrics, and evaluation code) to facilitate progress toward well-justified research assistants.", "AI": {"tldr": "Deep Research (DR)\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac1c\ubc29\ud615 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc5d0 \ub2f5\ubcc0\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud558\uba70, \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 DR\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud45c\uc900\ud654\ub41c \uae30\uc900\uc778 ResearchRubrics\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "Deep Research (DR)\ub294 \uac1c\ubc29\ud615 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub2f5\ubcc0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uae30\ub2a5\uc758 \ud1b5\ud569\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc0c8\ub86d\uac8c \ub5a0\uc624\ub974\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "ResearchRubrics\ub294 2,800\uc2dc\uac04 \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uc778\ub825 \ub178\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \ud45c\uc900\ud654\ub41c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub85c, \uc0ac\uc2e4\uc758 \uadfc\uac70, \ucd94\ub860\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131 \ubc0f \uba85\ub8cc\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 2,500\uac1c \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uac00 \uc791\uc131\ud55c \uc138\ubd84\ud654\ub41c \ub8e8\ube0c\ub9ad\uacfc \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \uc30d\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc5ec\ub7ec \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 DR \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, Gemini\uc758 DR \ubc0f OpenAI\uc758 DR\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc120\ub3c4\uc801\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub3c4 \ub8e8\ube0c\ub9ad \uc900\uc218\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uade0 68% \ubbf8\ub9cc\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc8fc\ub85c \uc554\uc2dc\uc801 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc758 \ub204\ub77d\uacfc \uac80\uc0c9\ub41c \uc815\ubcf4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubd88\ucda9\ubd84\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \ub54c\ubb38\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc2ec\uce35 \uc5f0\uad6c \ub2a5\ub825 \ud3c9\uac00\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70, ResearchRubrics(\ubaa8\ub4e0 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8, \ub8e8\ube0c\ub9ad \ubc0f \ud3c9\uac00 \ucf54\ub4dc\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568)\ub97c \uacf5\uac1c\ud558\uc5ec \uc798 \uc815\ub2f9\ud654\ub41c \uc5f0\uad6c \ubcf4\uc870 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub85c\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "Deep Research (DR)\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac1c\ubc29\ud615 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc5d0 \ub300\uc751\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Model watermarking counters MEAs by embedding forensic markers for ownership verification. Current black-box watermarks prioritize MEA survival through representation entanglement, yet inadequately explore resilience against sequential MEAs and removal attacks. Our study reveals that this risk is underestimated because existing removal methods are weakened by entanglement. To address this gap, we propose Watermark Removal attacK (WRK), which circumvents entanglement constraints by exploiting decision boundaries shaped by prevailing sample-level watermark artifacts. WRK effectively reduces watermark success rates by at least 88.79% across existing watermarking benchmarks.\n  For robust protection, we propose Class-Feature Watermarks (CFW), which improve resilience by leveraging class-level artifacts. CFW constructs a synthetic class using out-of-domain samples, eliminating vulnerable decision boundaries between original domain samples and their artifact-modified counterparts (watermark samples). CFW concurrently optimizes both MEA transferability and post-MEA stability. Experiments across multiple domains show that CFW consistently outperforms prior methods in resilience, maintaining a watermark success rate of at least 70.15% in extracted models even under the combined MEA and WRK distortion, while preserving the utility of protected models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud0b9 \uae30\uc220\uc774 \ubaa8\ub378 \ucd94\ucd9c \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ubd88\ucda9\ubd84\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc744 \ubc1d\ud788\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud0b9 \uc81c\uac70 \uacf5\uaca9 \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ubcf4\ud638 \uae30\uc220\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uadc0\uc911\ud55c \uc9c0\uc801 \uc7ac\uc0b0\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubaa8\ub378 \ucd94\ucd9c \uacf5\uaca9(MEA)\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\ub2e4.

Accepted for publication at the Journal of Machine Learning for Biomedical Imaging (MELBA) https://melba-journal.org/2025:027", "summary": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) models have demonstrated expert-level performance in melanoma detection, yet their clinical adoption is hindered by performance disparities across demographic subgroups such as gender, race, and age. Previous efforts to benchmark the performance of AI models have primarily focused on assessing model performance using group fairness metrics that rely on the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC), which does not provide insights into a model's ability to provide accurate estimates. In line with clinical assessments, this paper addresses this gap by incorporating calibration as a complementary benchmarking metric to AUROC-based fairness metrics. Calibration evaluates the alignment between predicted probabilities and observed event rates, offering deeper insights into subgroup biases. We assess the performance of the leading skin cancer detection algorithm of the ISIC 2020 Challenge on the ISIC 2020 Challenge dataset and the PROVE-AI dataset, and compare it with the second and third place models, focusing on subgroups defined by sex, race (Fitzpatrick Skin Tone), and age. Our findings reveal that while existing models enhance discriminative accuracy, they often over-diagnose risk and exhibit calibration issues when applied to new datasets.

Although prior research explored scenario generation for military training, pre-LLM AI tools struggled to generate sufficiently complex or adaptable scenarios. This paper introduces a multi-agent, multi-modal reasoning framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate critical training artifacts, such as Operations Orders (OPORDs). We structure our framework by decomposing scenario generation into a hierarchy of subproblems, and for each one, defining the role of the AI tool: (1) generating options for a human author to select from, (2) producing a candidate product for human approval or modification, or (3) generating textual artifacts fully automatically. Our framework employs specialized LLM-based agents to address distinct subproblems. Each agent receives input from preceding subproblem agents, integrating both text-based scenario details and visual information (e.g., map features, unit positions and applies specialized reasoning to produce appropriate outputs. Subsequent agents process these outputs sequentially, preserving logical consistency and ensuring accurate document generation. This multi-agent strategy overcomes the limitations of basic prompting or single-agent approaches when tackling such highly complex tasks. We validate our framework through a proof-of-concept that generates the scheme of maneuver and movement section of an OPORD while estimating map positions and movements as a precursor demonstrating its feasibility and accuracy. Our results demonstrate the potential of LLM-driven multi-agent systems to generate coherent, nuanced documents and adapt dynamically to changing conditions, advancing automation in scenario generation for military training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8, \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ucd94\ub860 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c

In recent years, large language models (LLMs) and LLM-based agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various software engineering (SE) tasks, enabling them to effectively address software security challenges such as vulnerability detection. However, systematic evaluation of the capabilities of LLMs and LLM-based agents in security patch detection remains limited. To bridge this gap, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of LLMs and LLM-based agents for security patch detection. Specifically, we investigate three methods: Plain LLM (a single LLM with a system prompt), Data-Aug LLM (data augmentation based on the Plain LLM), and the ReAct Agent (leveraging the thought-action-observation mechanism). We also evaluate the performance of both commercial and open-source LLMs under these methods and compare these results with those of existing baselines. Furthermore, we analyze the detection performance of these methods across various vulnerability types, and examine the impact of different prompting strategies and context window sizes on the results. Our findings reveal that the Data-Aug LLM achieves the best overall performance, whereas the ReAct Agent demonstrates the lowest false positive rate (FPR). Although baseline methods exhibit strong accuracy, their false positive rates are significantly higher. In contrast, our evaluated methods achieve comparable accuracy while substantially reducing the FPR. These findings provide valuable insights into the practical applications of LLMs and LLM-based agents in security patch detection, highlighting their advantage in maintaining robust performance while minimizing false positive rates.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubcf4\uc548 \ud328\uce58 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uc5d0\uc11c LLM\uacfc LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758

This is especially a concern in vision-based environments where minor manipulations of high-dimensional image inputs can easily mislead the agent's behavior. To this end, various defenses have been proposed recently, with state-of-the-art approaches achieving robust performance even under large state perturbations. However, after closer investigation, we found that the effectiveness of the current defenses is due to a fundamental weakness of the existing $l_p$ norm-constrained attacks, which can barely alter the semantics of image input even under a relatively large perturbation budget. In this work, we propose SHIFT, a novel policy-agnostic diffusion-based state perturbation attack to go beyond this limitation. Our attack is able to generate perturbed states that are semantically different from the true states while remaining realistic and history-aligned to avoid detection. Evaluations show that our attack effectively breaks existing defenses, including the most sophisticated ones, significantly outperforming existing attacks while being more perceptually stealthy. The results highlight the vulnerability of RL agents to semantics-aware adversarial perturbations, indicating the importance of developing more robust policies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub180\ub77c\uc6b4 \uc131\uacf5\uc744 \uac70\ub450\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788 \ube44\uc804 \uae30\ubc18 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uc785\ub825\uc758 \uc791\uc740 \uc870\uc791\uc774 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc27d\uac8c \uc624\ub3c4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 SHIFT\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc815\ucc45 \ube44\uc758\uc874\uc801 \ud655\uc0b0 \uae30\ubc18 \uc0c1\ud0dc \ubc29\ud574 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc815\ucc45\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \ud655\uc0b0 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc0c1\ud0dc \ubc29\ud574 \uacf5\uaca9 \uae30\ubc95\uc778 SHIFT\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "SHIFT \uacf5\uaca9\uc740 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\uc5b4\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubb34\ub108\ub728\ub9ac\uace0, \uae30\uc874 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \ucd08\uc6d4\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc778\uc2dd \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ubc29\ud574\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70, \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc815\ucc45\uc758 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL) \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub180\ub77c\uc6b4 \uc131\uacf5\uc744 \uac70\ub450\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ud2b9\ud788 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uc785\ub825\uc758 \uc791\uc740 \uc870\uc791\uc774 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc27d\uac8c \uc624\ub3c4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ube44\uc804 \uae30\ubc18 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\ub824\ub418\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubaa9\uc801\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ucd5c\uadfc \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubc29\uc5b4 \uae30\ubc95\uc774 \uc81c\uc548\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ud070 \uc0c1\ud0dc \ubc29\ud574\uc5d0\ub3c4 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ub354 \uc790\uc138\ud788 \uc870\uc0ac\ud574\ubcf8 \uacb0\uacfc, \ud604\uc7ac \ubc29\uc5b4\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub294 \uae30\uc874\uc758 $l_p$ \ub178\ub984 \uc81c\uc57d \uacf5\uaca9\uc758 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uc57d\uc810 \ub54c\ubb38\uc784\uc744 \uc54c\uac8c \ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacf5\uaca9\uc740 \uc0c1\ub300\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud070 \ubc29\ud574 \uc608\uc0b0 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uc785\ub825\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8\ub97c \uac70\uc758 \ubcc0\uacbd\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 SHIFT\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc815\ucc45 \ube44\uc758\uc874\uc801 \ud655\uc0b0 \uae30\ubc18 \uc0c1\ud0dc \ubc29\ud574 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacf5\uaca9\uc740 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc774\uba70 \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\ub82c\ub41c \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c4\uc815\ud55c \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc640 \uc758\ubbf8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \ubc29\ud574 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud3c9\uac00 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacf5\uaca9\uc740 \uac00\uc7a5 \uc815\uad50\ud55c \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\uc5b4\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubb34\ub108\ub728\ub9ac\uba70, \uae30\uc874 \uacf5\uaca9\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud558\uace0 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc778\uc9c0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc740\ubc00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 RL \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc778\uc2dd \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ubc29\ud574\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70, \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc815\ucc45 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

In review", "summary": "Mitigating anthropogenic methane sources is one the most cost-effective levers to slow down global warming. While satellite-based imaging spectrometers, such as EMIT, PRISMA, and EnMAP, can detect these point sources, current methane retrieval methods based on matched filters still produce a high number of false detections requiring laborious manual verification. This paper describes the operational deployment of a machine learning system for detecting methane emissions within the Methane Alert and Response System (MARS) of the United Nations Environment Programme's International Methane Emissions Observatory. We created the largest and most diverse global dataset of annotated methane plumes from three imaging spectrometer missions and quantitatively compared different deep learning model configurations. Focusing on the requirements for operational deployment, we extended prior evaluation methodologies from small tiled datasets to full granule evaluation. This revealed that deep learning models still produce a large number of false detections, a problem we address with model ensembling, which reduced false detections by over 74%. Deployed in the MARS pipeline, our system processes scenes and proposes plumes to analysts, accelerating the detection and analysis process. During seven months of operational deployment, it facilitated the verification of 1,351 distinct methane leaks, resulting in 479 stakeholder notifications. We further demonstrate the model's utility in verifying mitigation success through case studies in Libya, Argentina, Oman, and Azerbaijan.

The agent leverages native tools like WMI and ETW for lowlevel monitoring of system activities such as process execution, registry modifications, and network behaviour. A machine learning-based detection engine, trained on labelled datasets of benign and malicious activity, enables accurate threat identification with minimal false positives. Detection techniques are mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK framework for standardized threat classification. Designed for extensibility, the system includes a centralized interface for alerting and forensic analysis.

The proposed method provides instantaneous solutions to a spectrum of complex, multidimensional optimization problems. A micromixer case study is employed to demonstrate this methodology. An agent, operating on a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) architecture, serves as the optimizer to explore the relationships between key problem parameters. This optimizer interacts with an environment constituted by a parametric Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN), which responds to the agent's actions at a significantly higher speed than traditional numerical methods. The agent's objective, conditioned on the Schmidt number is to discover the optimal geometric and physical parameters that maximize the micromixer's efficiency. After training the agent across a wide range of Schmidt numbers, we analyzed the resulting optimal designs. Across this entire spectrum, the achieved efficiency was consistently greater than the baseline, normalized value. The maximum efficiency occurred at a Schmidt number of 13.3, demonstrating an improvement of approximately 32%. Finally, a comparative analysis with a Genetic Algorithm was conducted under equivalent conditions to underscore the advantages of the proposed method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294

Includes 7 pages of supplementary material", "summary": "Safety and efficiency are both important factors when deploying large language models(LLMs). LLMs are trained to follow human alignment for safety, and post training quantization(PTQ) is applied afterward for efficiency. However, these two objectives are often in conflict, revealing a fundamental flaw in the conventional PTQ paradigm: quantization can turn into a safety vulnerability if it only aims to achieve low perplexity. Models can demonstrate low perplexity yet exhibit significant degradation in alignment with the safety policy, highlighting that perplexity alone is an insufficient and often misleading proxy for model safety. To address this, we propose Alignment-Aware Quantization(AAQ), a novel approach that integrates Alignment-Preserving Contrastive(APC) loss into the PTQ pipeline. Compared to simple reconstruction loss, ours explicitly preserves alignment by encouraging the quantized model to mimic its safe, instruction-tuned model while diverging from the unaligned, pre-trained counterpart. Our method achieves this robust safety alignment without resorting to specialized safety-focused calibration datasets, highlighting its practical utility and broad applicability. AAQ is compatible with standard PTQ techniques and enables robust 4-bit (W4A4) quantization across diverse model families such as LLaMA, Qwen, and Mistral while maintaining safety where previous methods fail.

A Further Step Towards Understanding Jailbreaking VLMs", "comment": null, "summary": "Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are susceptible to jailbreak attacks: researchers have developed a variety of attack strategies that can successfully bypass the safety mechanisms of VLMs. Among these approaches, jailbreak methods based on the Out-of-Distribution (OOD) strategy have garnered widespread attention due to their simplicity and effectiveness. This paper further advances the in-depth understanding of OOD-based VLM jailbreak methods. Experimental results demonstrate that jailbreak samples generated via mild OOD strategies exhibit superior performance in circumventing the safety constraints of VLMs--a phenomenon we define as ''weak-OOD''. To unravel the underlying causes of this phenomenon, this study takes SI-Attack, a typical OOD-based jailbreak method, as the research object. We attribute this phenomenon to a trade-off between two dominant factors: input intent perception and model refusal triggering. The inconsistency in how these two factors respond to OOD manipulations gives rise to this phenomenon. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical argument for the inevitability of such inconsistency from the perspective of discrepancies between model pre-training and alignment processes. Building on the above insights, we draw inspiration from optical character recognition (OCR) capability enhancement--a core task in the pre-training phase of mainstream VLMs. Leveraging this capability, we design a simple yet highly effective VLM jailbreak method, whose performance outperforms that of SOTA baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\ud615 \ube44\uc804-\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(VLMs)\uc774 jailbreak \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\uba70, \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 OOD \uae30\ubc18 VLM jailbreak \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \uc2ec\uce35 \uc774\ud574\ub97c \ubc1c\uc804\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "VLM\uc758 \uc548\uc804 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc6b0\ud68c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uacf5\uaca9 \uc804\ub7b5\uc774 \uac1c\ubc1c\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uadf8 \uc911 OOD \uae30\ubc18\uc758 jailbreak \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc8fc\ubaa9\ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 SI-Attack\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc804\ud615\uc801\uc778 OOD \uae30\ubc18\uc758 jailbreak \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uc5ec, \uc785\ub825 \uc758\ub3c4 \uc778\uc2dd\uacfc \ubaa8\ub378 \uac70\ubd80 \uc720\ubc1c \uac04\uc758 \ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ub4dc\uc624\ud504\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc628\uac74\ud55c OOD \uc804\ub7b5\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c jailbreak \uc0d8\ud50c\uc774 VLM\uc758 \uc548\uc804 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \uc6b0\ud68c\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "VLM\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\uacfc \uc815\ub82c \uacfc\uc815\uc758 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\uc5d0\uc11c \ube44\ub86f\ub41c \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub97c \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub17c\uc758\ud558\uace0, OCR \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud574 \uac04\ub2e8\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 VLM jailbreak \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \ube44\uc804-\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(VLMs)\uc740 jailbreak \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\uba70, \uc5f0\uad6c\uc790\ub4e4\uc740 VLM\uc758 \uc548\uc804 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b0\ud68c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uacf5\uaca9 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\ubc95 \uc911\uc5d0\uc11c Out-of-Distribution (OOD) \uc804\ub7b5\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c jailbreak \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uadf8 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud568\uacfc \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131 \ub355\ubd84\uc5d0 \ub110\ub9ac \uc8fc\ubaa9\ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 OOD \uae30\ubc18 VLM jailbreak \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2ec\uce35 \uc774\ud574\ub97c \ub354\uc6b1 \ubc1c\uc804\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc628\uac74\ud55c OOD \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c jailbreak \uc0d8\ud50c\uc774 VLM\uc758 \uc548\uc804 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \uc6b0\ud68c\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc784\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\ub97c ''\uc57d\ud55c-OOD''\ub77c\ub294 \ud604\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\uc758\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud604\uc0c1\uc758 \uadfc\ubcf8 \uc6d0\uc778\uc744 \ubc1d\ud788\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc804\ud615\uc801\uc778 OOD \uae30\ubc18 jailbreak \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 SI-Attack\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \uc0bc\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \uc785\ub825 \uc758\ub3c4 \uc778\uc2dd\uacfc \ubaa8\ub378 \uac70\ubd80 \uc720\ubc1c\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc694\uc778 \uc0ac\uc774\uc758 \ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ub4dc\uc624\ud504\uc5d0 \uae30\uc778\ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \uc124\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub450 \uc694\uc778\uc774 OOD \uc870\uc791\uc5d0 \ubc18\uc751\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\uac00 \uc774 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\uacfc \uc815\ub82c \uacfc\uc815\uc758 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\uc758 \ubd88\uac00\ud53c\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc8fc\uc7a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc704\uc758 \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc885\ud569\uc801\uc778 VLM\uc758 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \ud575\uc2ec \uacfc\uc81c\uc778 \uad11\ud559 \ubb38\uc790 \uc778\uc2dd(OCR) \uae30\ub2a5 \uac15\ud654\uc5d0\uc11c \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc558\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac04\ub2e8\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 VLM jailbreak \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uadf8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc740 \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uae30\uc220 \uc218\uc900(SOTA) \uae30\uc900\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Gower"], "title": "Schedulers for Schedule-free: Theoretically inspired hyperparameters", "comment": null, "summary": "The recently proposed schedule-free method has been shown to achieve strong performance when hyperparameter tuning is limited. The current theory for schedule-free only supports a constant learning rate, where-as the implementation used in practice uses a warm-up schedule. We show how to extend the last-iterate convergence theory of schedule-free to allow for any scheduler, and how the averaging parameter has to be updated as a function of the learning rate. We then perform experiments showing how our convergence theory has some predictive power with regards to practical executions on deep neural networks, despite that this theory relies on assuming convexity. When applied to the warmup-stable-decay (wsd) schedule, our theory shows the optimal convergence rate of $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{T})$. We then use convexity to design a new adaptive Polyak learning rate schedule for schedule-free. We prove an optimal anytime last-iterate convergence for our new Polyak schedule, and show that it performs well compared to a number of baselines on a black-box model distillation task.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\uc5d0 \uad6c\uc560\ubc1b\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \uc870\uc815\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub420 \ub54c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\uc5d0 \uad6c\uc560\ubc1b\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ud604\uc7ac \uc774\ub860\uc740 \uc0c1\uc218 \ud559\uc2b5\ub960\ub9cc \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc2e4\uc81c \uad6c\ud604\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc6dc\uc5c5 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\uc774 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\uc5d0 \uad6c\uc560\ubc1b\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9 \ubc18\ubcf5 \uc218\ub834 \uc774\ub860\uc744 \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uace0 \ud559\uc2b5\ub960\uc758 \ud568\uc218\ub85c \ud3c9\uade0 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc218\ub834 \uc774\ub860\uc774 \uae4a\uc740 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc2e4\ud589\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ud558\uc5ec \uc608\uce21\ub825\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uc6dc\uc5c5-\uc548\uc815-\uac10\uc18c(wsd) \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uc218\ub834 \uc18d\ub3c4\ub97c $\textmath{O}(1/\textmath{\root{T}})$\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc801\uc751\ud615 Polyak \ud559\uc2b5\ub960 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uace0, \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc99d\ub958 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5ec\ub7ec \uae30\uc900 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc88b\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud568\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\uc5d0 \uad6c\uc560\ubc1b\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \uc870\uc815\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub420 \ub54c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4. \ud604\uc7ac \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\uc5d0 \uad6c\uc560\ubc1b\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc774\ub860\uc740 \uc77c\uc815\ud55c \ud559\uc2b5\ub960\ub9cc\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc2e4\uc81c \uad6c\ud604\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc6dc\uc5c5 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\uc774 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub41c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\uc5d0 \uad6c\uc560\ubc1b\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9 \ubc18\ubcf5 \uc218\ub834 \uc774\ub860\uc744 \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\ub7ec\ub97c \ud5c8\uc6a9\ud558\uace0, \ud3c9\uade0 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ub960\uc758 \ud568\uc218\ub85c \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ud574\uc57c \ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7f0 \ub2e4\uc74c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc218\ub834 \uc774\ub860\uc774 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \uac00\uc815\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uae4a\uc740 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc758 \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc2e4\ud589\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ud558\uc5ec \uc608\uce21\ub825\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\ub294 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6dc\uc5c5-\uc548\uc815-\uac10\uc18c(WSB) \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud560 \ub54c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc774\ub860\uc740 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uc218\ub834 \uc18d\ub3c4\uac00 $\textmath{O}(1/\textmath{\root{T}})$\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c, \ud63c\ud569\ud615 Polyak \ud559\uc2b5\ub960 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uace0 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 Polyak \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uc5b8\uc81c\ub098 \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9 \ubc18\ubcf5 \uc218\ub834\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud558\uba70, \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc99d\ub958 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5ec\ub7ec \uae30\uc900\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc88b\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4."}}

In order to overcome the limitations of existing negative sampling strategies, such as vulnerability to false negatives, limited generalization, and lack of control over sample hardness, we propose DANS-KGC (Diffusion-based Adaptive Negative Sampling for Knowledge Graph Completion). DANS-KGC comprises three key components: the Difficulty Assessment Module (DAM), the Adaptive Negative Sampling Module (ANS), and the Dynamic Training Mechanism (DTM). DAM evaluates the learning difficulty of entities by integrating semantic and structural features. Based on this assessment, ANS employs a conditional diffusion model with difficulty-aware noise scheduling, leveraging semantic and neighborhood information during the denoising phase to generate negative samples of diverse hardness. DTM further enhances learning by dynamically adjusting the hardness distribution of negative samples throughout training, enabling a curriculum-style progression from easy to hard examples. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization ability of DANS-KGC, with the method achieving state-of-the-art results on all three evaluation metrics for the UMLS and YAGO3-10 datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "DANS-KGC\ub294 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc644\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubd80\uc815 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0, \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ubd80\uc815 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1, \ub3d9\uc801 \ud6c8\ub828 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 \ubd80\uc815 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \uc804\ub7b5\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "DANS-KGC\ub294 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0 \ud3c9\uac00 \ubaa8\ub4c8(DAM), \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ubd80\uc815 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \ubaa8\ub4c8(ANS), \ub3d9\uc801 \ud6c8\ub828 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998(DTM)\uc758 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub85c \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc838 \uc788\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc5ec\uc12f \uac1c\uc758 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c DANS-KGC\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uacfc \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "DANS-KGC\ub294 UMLS \ubc0f YAGO3-10 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc758 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud3c9\uac00 \uc9c0\ud45c\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uace0 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubd80\uc815 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1(NS) \uc804\ub7b5\uc740 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ud45c\ud604\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubd80\uc815 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \uc804\ub7b5\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4, \uc989 \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \ubd80\uc815\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucde8\uc57d\uc131, \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654, \uc0d8\ud50c \ub09c\uc774\ub3c4 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ubd80\uc871\uc744 \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 DANS-KGC(\uc9c0\uc2dd \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc644\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud655\uc0b0 \uae30\ubc18 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ubd80\uc815 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

The foreseen trend is that they will play an increasingly visible role in daily life, which will have to be backed by appropriate operational resources. For example, due to increasing demand, smart contracts could soon face a shortage of knowledgeable users and tools to handle them in practice. Widespread smart contract adoption is currently limited by security, usability and costs aspects. Because of a steep learning curve, the handling of smart contracts is currently performed by specialised developers mainly, and most of the research effort is focusing on smart contract security, while other aspects like usability being somewhat neglected. Specific tools would lower the entry barrier, enabling interested non-experts to create smart contracts.\n  In this paper we designed, developed and tested Blockly2Hooks, a solution towards filling this gap even in challenging scenarios such as when the smart contracts are written in an advanced language like C. With the XRP Ledger as a concrete working case, Blockly2Hooks helps interested non-experts from the community to learn smart contracts easily and adopt the technology, through leveraging well-proven teaching methodologies like Visual Programming Languages, and more specifically, the Blockly Visual Programming library from Google. The platform was developed and tested and the results are promising to make learning smart contract development smoother.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 Blockly2Hooks\ub97c \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uace0 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc5ec \ube44\uc804\ubb38\uac00\uac00 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uacc4\uc57d\uc744 \uc27d\uac8c \ubc30\uc6b0\uace0 \uae30\uc220\uc744 \ucc44\ud0dd\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ub3d5\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uacc4\uc57d\uc758 \uc218\uc694 \uc99d\uac00\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ud574\ub2f9 \ubd84\uc57c\uc758 \uc804\ubb38 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uacfc \ub3c4\uad6c\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ubcf4\uc548, \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc131 \ubc0f \ube44\uc6a9 \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \ucc44\ud0dd\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "Blockly2Hooks\ub294 \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d \uc5b8\uc5b4\uc640 \uad6c\uae00\uc758 Blockly \ub77c\uc774\ube0c\ub7ec\ub9ac\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \ube44\uc804\ubb38\uac00\uac00 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uacc4\uc57d\uc744 \uc27d\uac8c \ubc30\uc6b0\uace0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud574\uc8fc\ub294 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "XRP \uc6d0\uc7a5\uc744 \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc778 \uc0ac\ub840\ub85c \ub4e4\uc5b4, Blockly2Hooks\ub294 \ube44\uc804\ubb38\uac00\ub4e4\uc774 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uacc4\uc57d\uc744 \uc27d\uac8c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uace0 \ucc44\ud0dd\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uac1c\ubc1c\ub41c \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc758 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uacc4\uc57d \uac1c\ubc1c \ud559\uc2b5\uc774 \ub354 \uc6d0\ud65c\ud574\uc9c8 \uc218 \uc788\uc744 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \uae30\ub300\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc\uc758 \uae30\uc220\ub4e4\uc740 \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc6d0\uc7a5 \uae30\uc220\uc758 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ubc1c\uc804\uc5d0\uc11c \ud30c\uc0dd\ub41c inter-ledger \uc9c0\ubd88, \ub300\uccb4 \ubd88\uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud1a0\ud070, \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uacc4\uc57d \ub4f1\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub4e4\uc740 \uc77c\uc0c1 \uc0dd\ud65c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub208\uc5d0 \ub744\ub294 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud558\uac8c \ub420 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \uc608\uc0c1\ub418\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc801\uc808\ud55c \uc6b4\uc601 \uc790\uc6d0\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc608\ub97c \ub4e4\uc5b4, \uc218\uc694 \uc99d\uac00\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uacc4\uc57d\uc740 \uace7 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc640 \uc774\ub97c \uc2e4\uc81c\ub85c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud560 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc758 \ubd80\uc871 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud604\uc7ac \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uacc4\uc57d\uc758 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \ucc44\ud0dd\uc740 \ubcf4\uc548, \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc131, \ube44\uc6a9 \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\ud55c\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae09\uaca9\ud55c \ud559\uc2b5 \uace1\uc120\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uacc4\uc57d \ucc98\ub9ac\ub294 \uc8fc\ub85c \uc804\ubb38 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc790\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c \ub178\ub825\uc740 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uacc4\uc57d\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \ubc18\uba74, \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc131\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ub2e4\ub978 \uce21\uba74\uc740 \ub2e4\uc18c \uc18c\ud640\ud788 \uc5ec\uaca8\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud2b9\uc815 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub4e4\uc740 \uc9c4\uc785 \uc7a5\ubcbd\uc744 \ub0ae\ucd94\uc5b4, \uad00\uc2ec \uc788\ub294 \ube44\uc804\ubb38\uac00\ub4e4\uc774 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uacc4\uc57d\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud574\uc904 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 Blockly2Hooks\ub97c \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uace0 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc5ec, C\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uace0\uae09 \uc5b8\uc5b4\ub85c \uc791\uc131\ub41c \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uacc4\uc57d\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8e8\ub294 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc774 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uc18c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, existing approaches such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and its variants, while effective on reasoning benchmarks, struggle with agentic tasks that require iterative decision-making. We introduce Murphy, a multi-turn reflective optimization framework that extends GRPO by incorporating iterative self-correction during training. By leveraging both quantitative and qualitative execution feedback, Murphy enables models to progressively refine their reasoning across multiple turns.

The system integrates a lightweight conditional diffusion encoder and convolutional classifier trained using subject-specific EEG data acquired from a Korean-language paradigm. A dual-criterion early stopping strategy enabled rapid convergence under limited calibration data, while dropout regularization and grouped temporal convolutions ensured stable generalization. During online operation, continuous EEG streams were processed in two-second sliding windows to generate class probabilities that dynamically modulated visual and auditory feedback according to decoding confidence. Across twenty real-time trials, the framework achieved 65% top-1 and 70% top-2 accuracy, outperforming offline evaluation (50% top-1). These results demonstrate the feasibility of deploying diffusion-based EEG decoding under practical clinical constraints, maintaining reliable performance despite environmental variability and minimal preprocessing.

However, writing such queries is challenging and requires diverse expertise in security and program analysis. To address this challenge, we present QLCoder - an agentic framework that automatically synthesizes queries in CodeQL, a powerful static analysis engine, directly from a given CVE metadata. QLCode embeds an LLM in a synthesis loop with execution feedback, while constraining its reasoning using a custom MCP interface that allows structured interaction with a Language Server Protocol (for syntax guidance) and a RAG database (for semantic retrieval of queries and documentation). This approach allows QLCoder to generate syntactically and semantically valid security queries. We evaluate QLCode on 176 existing CVEs across 111 Java projects. Building upon the Claude Code agent framework, QLCoder synthesizes correct queries that detect the CVE in the vulnerable but not in the patched versions for 53.4% of CVEs.

RL typically employs reward functions to define task objectives and guide agent learning. However, since the reward function serves the dual purpose of defining the optimal goal and guiding learning, it is challenging to design the reward function manually, which often results in a suboptimal task representation. To tackle the reward design challenge in RL, inspired by the satisficing theory, we propose a Test-driven Reinforcement Learning (TdRL) framework. In the TdRL framework, multiple test functions are used to represent the task objective rather than a single reward function. Test functions can be categorized as pass-fail tests and indicative tests, each dedicated to defining the optimal objective and guiding the learning process, respectively, thereby making defining tasks easier. Building upon such a task definition, we first prove that if a trajectory return function assigns higher returns to trajectories closer to the optimal trajectory set, maximum entropy policy optimization based on this return function will yield a policy that is closer to the optimal policy set. Then, we introduce a lexicographic heuristic approach to compare the relative distance relationship between trajectories and the optimal trajectory set for learning the trajectory return function. Furthermore, we develop an algorithm implementation of TdRL. Experimental results on the DeepMind Control Suite benchmark demonstrate that TdRL matches or outperforms handcrafted reward methods in policy training, with greater design simplicity and inherent support for multi-objective optimization.

Our framework focuses on practicality, demonstrating extensibility beyond wired EEG devices to portable, wireless hardware. A user identification module recognizes the operator and provides a personalized, user-specific service. To achieve seamless, real-time operation, we utilize the lab streaming layer to manage the continuous streaming of live EEG signals to the personalized decoder. This end-to-end pipeline enables a functional real-time application capable of classifying user commands from imagined speech EEG signals, achieving an overall 4-class accuracy of 62.00 % on a wired device and 46.67 % on a portable wireless headset.

IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence (2024)", "summary": "The integration of different learning paradigms has long been a focus of machine learning research, aimed at overcoming the inherent limitations of individual methods. Fuzzy rule-based models excel in interpretability and have seen widespread application across diverse fields. However, they face challenges such as complex design specifications and scalability issues with large datasets. The fusion of different techniques and strategies, particularly Gradient Boosting, with Fuzzy Rule-Based Models offers a robust solution to these challenges. This paper proposes an Integrated Fusion Framework that merges the strengths of both paradigms to enhance model performance and interpretability. At each iteration, a Fuzzy Rule-Based Model is constructed and controlled by a dynamic factor to optimize its contribution to the overall ensemble. This control factor serves multiple purposes: it prevents model dominance, encourages diversity, acts as a regularization parameter, and provides a mechanism for dynamic tuning based on model performance, thus mitigating the risk of overfitting. Additionally, the framework incorporates a sample-based correction mechanism that allows for adaptive adjustments based on feedback from a validation set. Experimental results substantiate the efficacy of the presented gradient boosting framework for fuzzy rule-based models, demonstrating performance enhancement, especially in terms of mitigating overfitting and complexity typically associated with many rules. By leveraging an optimal factor to govern the contribution of each model, the framework improves performance, maintains interpretability, and simplifies the maintenance and update of the models.",

This problem is particularly important in machine learning involving high-dimensional, multimodal data such as social media, bioinformatics or recommendation systems. Existing Multi-View Multi-Label Feature Selection (MVMLFS) methods mainly focus on analyzing statistical information of data, but seldom consider semantic information. In this paper, we aim to use these two types of information jointly and propose a method that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) semantic reasoning with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) structural modeling for MVMLFS. Specifically, the method consists of three main components. (1) LLM is first used as an evaluation agent to assess the latent semantic relevance among feature, view, and label descriptions. (2) A semantic-aware heterogeneous graph with two levels is designed to represent relations among features, views and labels: one is a semantic graph representing semantic relations, and the other is a statistical graph. (3) A lightweight Graph Attention Network (GAT) is applied to learn node embedding in the heterogeneous graph as feature saliency scores for ranking and selection. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines, and it is still effective when applied to small-scale datasets, showcasing its robustness, flexibility, and generalization ability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubdf0 \ub2e4\uc911 \ub808\uc774\ube14 \uae30\ub2a5 \uc120\ud0dd\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\ubcf4\uc758 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \ubc0f \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ubd84\uc11d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \ub2e4\uc911\ubaa8\ub4dc \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \uad00\ub828\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0, \ub450 \uc218\uc900\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \uc758\ubbf8-aware \uc774\uc9c8 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uba70, \uacbd\ub7c9\ud654\ub41c \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc8fc\uc758 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc758 \uc911\uc694\ub3c4\ub97c \uc810\uc218\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub2e4\uc218\uc758 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\uba70, \uc18c\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uac15\ub825\ud558\uace0 \uc720\uc5f0\ud558\uba70 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub2e4\uc911 \ubdf0 \ub2e4\uc911 \ub808\uc774\ube14 \uae30\ub2a5 \uc120\ud0dd\uc740 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801 \ubdf0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ubcf4\uc131\uc744 \uac16\ucd98 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud558\uba70, \uac01 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc740 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc758\uc874\uc801\uc778 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub808\uc774\ube14\uacfc \uc5f0\uacb0\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \uc18c\uc15c \ubbf8\ub514\uc5b4, \uc0dd\ubb3c\uc815\ubcf4\ud559 \ub610\ub294 \ucd94\ucc9c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \uad00\ub828\ub41c \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud2b9\ud788 \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubdf0 \ub2e4\uc911 \ub808\uc774\ube14 \uae30\ub2a5 \uc120\ud0dd(MVMLFS) \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc8fc\ub85c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc810\uc744 \ub450\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \uc815\ubcf4\ub294 \uac70\uc758 \uace0\ub824\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc720\ud615\uc758 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc870\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uacfc \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(GNNs)\uc758 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub85c \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc838 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

In many real-world settings, online interactions can be risky, and accurately specifying the reward and the safety cost information at each timestep can be difficult. However, it is often feasible to collect trajectories reflecting undesirable or risky behavior, implicitly conveying the behavior the agent should avoid. We refer to these trajectories as non-preferred trajectories. Unlike standard IL, which aims to mimic demonstrations, our agent must also learn to avoid risky behavior using non-preferred trajectories. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, SafeMIL, to learn a parameterized cost that predicts if the state-action pair is risky via \\textit{Multiple Instance Learning}. The learned cost is then used to avoid non-preferred behaviors, resulting in a policy that prioritizes safety. We empirically demonstrate that our approach can learn a safer policy that satisfies cost constraints without degrading the reward performance, thereby outperforming several baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uc548\uc804 \ubaa8\ubc29 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8f9\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc548\uc804\uc744 \uc6b0\uc120\uc2dc\ud558\ub294 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc704\ud5d8\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud53c\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2e4\uc81c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc774 \uc704\ud5d8\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uace0, \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubc0f \uc548\uc804 \ube44\uc6a9 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc815\ud655\ud788 \uc9c0\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b8 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "Multiple Instance Learning\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc0c1\ud0dc-\ud589\ub3d9 \uc30d\uc774 \uc704\ud5d8\ud55c\uc9c0 \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ud654\ub41c \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc778 SafeMIL\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ube44\uc6a9 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ucda9\uc871\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba74\uc11c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc800\ud558\uc2dc\ud0a4\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc5ec\ub7ec \uae30\uc900\uc120\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uc548\uc804 \ubaa8\ubc29 \ud559\uc2b5(IL) \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9ce\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc774 \uc704\ud5d8\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70 \uac01 \uc2dc\uac04\ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubc0f \uc548\uc804 \ube44\uc6a9 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc815\ud655\ud788 \uc9c0\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b8 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc885\uc885 \ud53c\ud574\uc57c \ud560 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubc18\uc601\ud558\ub294 \uada4\uc801\uc744 \uc218\uc9d1\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ud53c\ud574\uc57c \ud560 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc554\ubb35\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\ub2ec\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uada4\uc801\uc744 \ube44\uc120\ud638 \uada4\uc801(non-preferred trajectories)\uc774\ub77c\uace0 \ubd80\ub985\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ub370\ubaa8\ub97c \ubaa8\ubc29\ud558\ub824\ub294 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 IL\uacfc \ub2ec\ub9ac, \ube44\uc120\ud638 \uada4\uc801\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc704\ud5d8\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud53c\ud558\ub294 \ubc95\ub3c4 \ubc30\uc6cc\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc0c1\ud0dc-\ud589\ub3d9 \uc30d\uc774 \uc704\ud5d8\ud55c\uc9c0\ub97c \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ud654\ub41c \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc778 SafeMIL\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \ube44\uc6a9\uc740 \ube44\uc120\ud638 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud53c\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uc5b4 \uc548\uc804\uc744 \uc6b0\uc120\uc2dc\ud558\ub294 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc774 \ube44\uc6a9 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ub9cc\uc871\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc800\ud558\uc2dc\ud0a4\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \ub354 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc2e4\uc99d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uc5ec\ub7ec \uae30\uc900\uc120\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ub0b4\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

We present the Kamiwaza Agentic Merit Index (KAMI) v0.1, an enterprise-focused benchmark that addresses both contamination resistance and agentic evaluation. Through 170,000 LLM test items processing over 5.5 billion tokens across 35 model configurations, we demonstrate that traditional benchmark rankings poorly predict practical agentic performance. Notably, newer generation models like Llama 4 or Qwen 3 do not always outperform their older generation variants on enterprise-relevant tasks, contradicting traditional benchmark trends.

Speech-based assessments show promise for early detection, as phonetic motor planning deficits alter acoustic features (e.g., pitch, tone), while memory and language impairments lead to syntactic and semantic errors. However, conventional speech-processing pipelines with hand-crafted features or general-purpose audio classifiers often exhibit limited performance and generalizability. To address these limitations, we introduce SpeechCARE, a multimodal speech processing pipeline that leverages pretrained, multilingual acoustic and linguistic transformer models to capture subtle speech-related cues associated with cognitive impairment. Inspired by the Mixture of Experts (MoE) paradigm, SpeechCARE employs a dynamic fusion architecture that weights transformer-based acoustic, linguistic, and demographic inputs, allowing integration of additional modalities (e.g., social factors, imaging) and enhancing robustness across diverse tasks. Its robust preprocessing includes automatic transcription, large language model (LLM)-based anomaly detection, and task identification. A SHAP-based explainability module and LLM reasoning highlight each modality's contribution to decision-making.

We propose Adaptive Regularized Multi-Agent Soft Actor-Critic (ARAC), which integrates an attention-based graph neural network (GNN) for modeling agent dependencies with an adaptive divergence regularization mechanism. The GNN enables expressive representation of spatial relations and state features in graph environments. Divergence regularization can serve as policy guidance to alleviate the sparse reward problem, but it may lead to suboptimal convergence when the reference policy itself is imperfect. The adaptive divergence regularization mechanism enables the framework to exploit reference policies for efficient exploration in the early stages, while gradually reducing reliance on them as training progresses to avoid inheriting their limitations. Experiments in pursuit and confrontation scenarios demonstrate that ARAC achieves faster convergence, higher final success rates, and stronger scalability across varying numbers of agents compared with MARL baselines, highlighting its effectiveness in complex graph-structured environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "ARAC\ub294 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uad6c\uc870\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc815\ucc45 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ube60\ub978 \uc218\ub834\uacfc \ub192\uc740 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uad6c\uc870\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud76c\ubc15\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc774 \uc815\ucc45 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ubc29\ud574\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "Adaptive Regularized Multi-Agent Soft Actor-Critic (ARAC)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc8fc\uc758 \uae30\ubc18 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(GNN)\uacfc \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ubd84\uae30 \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud588\ub2e4.", "result": "ARAC\ub294 \ucd94\uc801 \ubc0f \ub300\uacb0 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\ub978 MARL \uae30\uc900\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud588\uc744 \ub54c \ub354 \ube60\ub978 \uc218\ub834\uacfc \ub192\uc740 \ucd5c\uc885 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \uae30\ub85d\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "ARAC\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uad6c\uc870 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc784\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uba70, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc218\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uac15\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uad6c\uc870\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(MARL) \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc791\uc5c5\uc778 \ucd94\uc801 \ubc0f \ub300\uacb0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ud76c\ubc15\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc774 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc815\ucc45 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ubc29\ud574\ud558\ub294 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uc870\uc815\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc8fc\uc758 \uae30\ubc18 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(GNN)\uacfc \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ubc1c\uc0b0 \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc561\ud130-\ud06c\ub9ac\ud2f1(ARAC)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

These developments benefit from methods that combine classical reconstruction techniques with data-driven approaches. Differentiable operators play a key role in this integration by enabling end-to-end optimization and the incorporation of physical modeling within neural networks.\n  In this work, we present an updated version of PYRO-NN, a Python-based library for differentiable CT reconstruction. The updated framework extends compatibility to PyTorch and introduces native CUDA kernel support for efficient projection and back-projection operations across parallel, fan, and cone-beam geometries. Additionally, it includes tools for simulating imaging artifacts, modeling arbitrary acquisition trajectories, and creating flexible, end-to-end trainable pipelines through a high-level Python API.

Many existing methods rely on massive, noisy synthetic datasets.This work introduces an efficient training pipeline that combines model-based data filtering with parameter-efficient fine-tuning. From 4.8M synthetic examples, 12K clean and diverse instances are curated by first identifying challenging cases, removing misaligned and then selecting a diverse set of multimodal instances. On this data, a 3B-parameter Vision-Language Model is trained under three regimes: supervised fine-tuning, chain-of-thought- augmented fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization. Models trained with the filtered data and lightweight training strategies match or surpass larger baselines on benchmarks such as ScreenSpot, Multimodal-Mind2Web, and AndroidControl. These results demonstrate that principled data curation and robust adaptation can rival large-scale training, enabling compact yet capable multimodal reasoning agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774

Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), have enabled virtual screening methods that reduce costs and improve efficiency. However, the growing complexity of these tools has limited their accessibility to wet-lab researchers. Multi-agent systems offer a promising solution by combining the interpretability of LLMs with the precision of specialized models and tools. In this work, we present MADD, a multi-agent system that builds and executes customized hit identification pipelines from natural language queries. MADD employs four coordinated agents to handle key subtasks in de novo compound generation and screening.

These metrics fail to capture the quality of an agent's decisions, its operational autonomy, or its ultimate business value. This white paper proposes a novel, comprehensive framework of eleven outcome-based, task-agnostic performance metrics for AI agents that transcend domain boundaries. These metrics are designed to enable organizations to evaluate agents based on the quality of their decisions, their degree of autonomy, their adaptability to new challenges, and the tangible business value they deliver, regardless of the underlying model architecture or specific use case. We introduce metrics such as Goal Completion Rate (GCR), Autonomy Index (AIx), Multi-Step Task Resilience (MTR), and Business Impact Efficiency (BIE). Through a large-scale simulated experiment involving four distinct agent architectures (ReAct, Chain-of-Thought, Tool-Augmented, Hybrid) across five diverse domains (Healthcare, Finance, Marketing, Legal, and Customer Service), we demonstrate the framework's efficacy. Our results reveal significant performance trade-offs between different agent designs, highlighting the Hybrid Agent as the most consistently high-performing model across the majority of our proposed metrics, achieving an average Goal Completion Rate of 88.8\\% and the highest Return on Investment (ROI).

Most existing GraphRAG efforts focus on Resource Description Framework (RDF) knowledge graphs, relying on triple representations and SPARQL queries. However, the potential of Cypher and Labeled Property Graph (LPG) databases to serve as scalable and effective reasoning engines within GraphRAG pipelines remains underexplored in current research literature. To fill this gap, we propose Multi-Agent GraphRAG, a modular LLM agentic system for text-to-Cypher query generation serving as a natural language interface to LPG-based graph data. Our proof-of-concept system features an LLM-based workflow for automated Cypher queries generation and execution, using Memgraph as the graph database backend. Iterative content-aware correction and normalization, reinforced by an aggregated feedback loop, ensures both semantic and syntactic refinement of generated queries.

Following the growing scientific interest in mechanistic interpretability, recent work encoded refusal behavior as a single direction in the model's latent space; e.g., computed as the difference between the centroids of harmful and harmless prompt representations. However, emerging evidence suggests that concepts in LLMs often appear to be encoded as a low-dimensional manifold embedded in the high-dimensional latent space. Motivated by these findings, we propose a novel method leveraging Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) to extract multiple refusal directions. To this end, we first prove that SOMs generalize the prior work's difference-in-means technique. We then train SOMs on harmful prompt representations to identify multiple neurons. By subtracting the centroid of harmless representations from each neuron, we derive a set of multiple directions expressing the refusal concept. We validate our method on an extensive experimental setup, demonstrating that ablating multiple directions from models' internals outperforms not only the single-direction baseline but also specialized jailbreak algorithms, leading to an effective suppression of refusal. Finally, we conclude by analyzing the mechanistic implications of our approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc548\uc804\ud558\uac8c \ud589\ub3d9\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc815\ub82c\ub41c \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc720\ud574\ud55c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \uac70\ubd80\ud558\ub294 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uacc4\uc801 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \uad00\uc2ec\uc774 \ub192\uc544\uc9d0\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uac70\ubd80 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ub354 \uc798 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "Self-Organizing Maps(SOMs)\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc5ec\ub7ec \uac1c\uc758 \uac70\ubd80 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "SOMs\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc2e0\uacbd\uc138\ud3ec\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0, \uc720\ud574\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ud45c\ud604\uc758 \uc911\uc2ec\uc744 \uac01 \uc2e0\uacbd\uc138\ud3ec\uc5d0\uc11c \ube7c\ub0b8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uac70\ubd80 \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \ud45c\ud604\ud558\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \uae30\uacc4\uc801 \ud568\uc758\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uba70 \ub17c\ubb38\uc744 \ub9c8\ubb34\ub9ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac70\ubd80\ub780 \uc548\uc804 \uc815\ub82c\ub41c \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc720\ud574\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ube44\uc724\ub9ac\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \uac70\ubd80\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uae30\ub2a5\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc758\ubbf8\ud55c\ub2e4. \uae30\uacc4\uc801 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \uad00\uc2ec\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \ucd5c\uadfc \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uac70\ubd80 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e8\uc77c \ubc29\ud5a5\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ud558\uc600\ub2e4; \uc608\ub97c \ub4e4\uc5b4, \uc720\ud574\ud55c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ud45c\ud604\uacfc \ud574\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ud45c\ud604\uc758 \uc911\uc2ec \uac04 \ucc28\uc774\ub85c \uacc4\uc0b0\ub41c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc99d\uac70\uc5d0 \ub530\ub974\uba74 LLM\uc5d0\uc11c \uac1c\ub150\ub4e4\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \uc7a0\uc7ac \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\ub41c \uc800\ucc28\uc6d0 \ub2e4\uc591\uccb4\ub85c \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ub418\ub294 \uac83\ucc98\ub7fc \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \ud1a0\ub300\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uac1c\uc758 \uac70\ubd80 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 Self-Organizing Maps(SOMs)\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uba3c\uc800 SOM\uc774 \uc774\uc804 \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \ud3c9\uade0 \ucc28\uc774 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ud6c4 \uc720\ud574\ud55c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ud45c\ud604\uc5d0\uc11c SOM\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\uc2dc\ucf1c \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc2e0\uacbd\uc138\ud3ec\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0, \uc720\ud574\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ud45c\ud604\uc758 \uc911\uc2ec\uc744 \uac01 \uc2e0\uacbd\uc138\ud3ec\uc5d0\uc11c \ube7c\ub0b4\uc5b4 \uac70\ubd80 \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \ud45c\ud604\ud558\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubc29\ud5a5\uc758 \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uace0, \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ub0b4\ubd80\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \uc81c\uac70\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ub2e8\uc77c \ubc29\ud5a5 \uae30\uc900\uc120\ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \ud2b9\uc218\ud55c \ud0c8\uc625 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\uc5ec \uac70\ubd80\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5b5\uc81c\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \uae30\uacc4\uc801 \ud568\uc758\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uba70 \uacb0\ub860\uc744 \ub0b4\ub9b0\ub2e4."}}

Traditional peer-to-peer repositories and developer communities for shared technical knowledge and best practice have witnessed dramatic drops in participation in a short period of time. At the same time, agentic functional equivalents are yet to emerge leaving AI agents, which already generate a significant proportion of all new software code produced, without access to repositories of valuable shared learning.\n  In this paper, we introduce Spark, a novel shared agentic memory architecture which is designed to emulate the collective intelligence and know-how of human developer communities. Spark enables AI coding agents to both contribute to and draw from a persistent and continuously evolving experiential memory. Agents operating in the same general problem space use the Spark shared memory as a repository of new knowledge to achieve collective continual learning. We evaluate Spark as a coach for AI coding agents performing software development tasks. We demonstrate that recommendations made by Spark improve the quality of code generated by generic code generation models at varying sizes and capability tiers. Boosted by Spark, a small open-weights model with 30 billion parameters was able to match the code quality afforded by a much larger state-of-the-art model. Separately, we measure the intrinsic quality of recommendations generated by Spark against a wide range of criteria inspired by software development best practice, and achieve helpfulness levels of up to 98.2% in the top two (out of five) qualitative helpfulness bands.", "AI": {"tldr": "Spark\ub294 AI \ucf54\ub529 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uac1c\ubc1c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud560 \ub54c \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c4\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc9d1\ub2e8 \uc9c0\uc18d \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacf5\uc720 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc778\uac04 \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uac1c\ubc1c \uad00\ud589\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \uc804\ud658\uc740 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc790\ub4e4\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uacf5\uc720 \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \ubc29\ud574\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "Spark\ub294 AI \ucf54\ub529 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uae30\uc5ec\ud558\uace0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ub9cc\ub4e0 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc9c4\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc774\ub2e4. \uac19\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18 \ubb38\uc81c \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc740 Spark \uacf5\uc720 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\ub97c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc758 \uc800\uc7a5\uc18c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc9d1\ub2e8 \uc9c0\uc18d \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "Spark\ub294 AI \ucf54\ub529 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0\uac8c \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uac1c\ubc1c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc744 \uc8fc\ub294 \ucf54\uce58 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uba70, Spark\uc758 \ucd94\ucc9c\uc774 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uaddc\ubaa8\uc640 \ub2a5\ub825 \uacc4\uce35\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \ucf54\ub4dc\uc758 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b4\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Spark\uc758 \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc73c\ub85c 300\uc5b5 \uac1c\uc758 \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \uc791\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud6e8\uc52c \ub354 \ud070 \ucd5c\uc2e0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \ucf54\ub4dc \ud488\uc9c8\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucd9c \uc218 \uc788\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, Spark\uac00 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c \ucd94\ucc9c\uc758 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uac1c\ubc1c \ucd5c\uc120 \uc0ac\ub840\uc5d0 \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uae30\uc900\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uce21\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \ucd5c\ub300 98.2%\uc758 \uc720\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc778\uac04 \uc911\uc2ec\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc911\uc2ec \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uac1c\ubc1c \uad00\ud589\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \uc804\ud658\uc740 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc790\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uacf5\uc720 \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \ubc29\ud574\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ud53c\uc5b4 \ud22c \ud53c\uc5b4 \ub9ac\ud3ec\uc9c0\ud1a0\ub9ac\uc640 \uacf5\uc720 \uae30\uc220 \uc9c0\uc2dd \ubc0f \ubaa8\ubc94 \uc0ac\ub840\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uac1c\ubc1c\uc790 \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ud2f0\ub294 \uc9e7\uc740 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc548\uc5d0 \ucc38\uc5ec\uac00 \uae09\uac10\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ube44\uc728\uc758 \uc0c8 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \ucf54\ub4dc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac12\uc9c4 \uacf5\uc720 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ub9ac\ud3ec\uc9c0\ud1a0\ub9ac \uc811\uadfc\uc774 \uacb0\uc5ec\ub41c \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc778\uac04 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc790 \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ud2f0\uc758 \uc9d1\ub2e8 \uc9c0\uc131\uacfc \ub178\ud558\uc6b0\ub97c \ubaa8\ubc29\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacf5\uc720 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc778 Spark\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

These developments point toward the emergence of video foundation models that function not only as visual generators but also as implicit world models, models that simulate the physical dynamics, agent-environment interactions, and task planning that govern real or imagined worlds. This survey provides a systematic overview of this evolution, conceptualizing modern video foundation models as the combination of two core components: an implicit world model and a video renderer. The world model encodes structured knowledge about the world, including physical laws, interaction dynamics, and agent behavior. It serves as a latent simulation engine that enables coherent visual reasoning, long-term temporal consistency, and goal-driven planning. The video renderer transforms this latent simulation into realistic visual observations, effectively producing videos as a \"window\" into the simulated world. We trace the progression of video generation through four generations, in which the core capabilities advance step by step, ultimately culminating in a world model, built upon a video generation model, that embodies intrinsic physical plausibility, real-time multimodal interaction, and planning capabilities spanning multiple spatiotemporal scales. For each generation, we define its core characteristics, highlight representative works, and examine their application domains such as robotics, autonomous driving, and interactive gaming. Finally, we discuss open challenges and design principles for next-generation world models, including the role of agent intelligence in shaping and evaluating these systems.
