However, the robustness of such systems against adversarial attack remains insufficiently understood. In this work, we study adversarial claim attacks against search-enabled LLM-based fact-checking systems under a realistic input-only threat model. We propose DECEIVE-AFC, an agent-based adversarial attack framework that integrates novel claim-level attack strategies and adversarial claim validity evaluation principles. DECEIVE-AFC systematically explores adversarial attack trajectories that disrupt search behavior, evidence retrieval, and LLM-based reasoning without relying on access to evidence sources or model internals. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets and real-world systems demonstrate that our attacks substantially degrade verification performance, reducing accuracy from 78.7% to 53.7%, and significantly outperform existing claim-based attack baselines with strong cross-system transferability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uac80\uc0c9\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uc0ac\uc2e4 \ud655\uc778 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uac16\ub294 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uba70, \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacf5\uaca9 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 DECEIVE-AFC\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uac80\uc0c9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c LLM\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc8fc\uc7a5\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\ub294 \uc0ac\uc2e4 \ud655\uc778 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub0b4\uad6c\uc131\uc774 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \uc774\ud574\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "DECEIVE-AFC\ub294 \uc8fc\uc7a5\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc804\ub7b5\uacfc \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc8fc\uc7a5 \uc720\ud6a8\uc131 \ud3c9\uac00 \uc6d0\uce59\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacf5\uaca9\uc740 \uac80\uc99d \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uc800\ud558\uc2dc\ucf1c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c 78.7%\uc5d0\uc11c 53.7%\ub85c \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc8fc\uc7a5 \uae30\ubc18 \uacf5\uaca9 \uae30\uc900\uc120 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70 \uac15\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uac04 \uc804\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uac80\uc0c9 \uae30\ub2a5\uc774 \uc788\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc0ac\uc2e4 \uac80\uc99d \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \ubc1d\ud788\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub300\ud55c \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \ub9c8\ub828\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac80\uc0c9\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uc0ac\uc2e4 \ud655\uc778 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc678\ubd80 \uc99d\uac70\ub97c \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\uc0c9\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc8fc\uc7a5\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc5bc\ub9c8\ub098 \uac15\ud55c\uc9c0\ub294 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \uc774\ud574\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \uc785\ub825 \uc804\uc6a9 \uc704\ud611 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uac80\uc0c9\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc0ac\uc2e4 \ud655\uc778 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc8fc\uc7a5 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc8fc\uc7a5 \uc218\uc900 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc804\ub7b5\uacfc \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc8fc\uc7a5 \uc720\ud6a8\uc131 \ud3c9\uac00 \uc6d0\uce59\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 DECEIVE-AFC\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Building sophisticated exploits requires deep expertise and manual effort, leading defenders to assume adversaries cannot afford tailored attacks at scale. AI agents break this balance by automating vulnerability discovery and exploitation across thousands of targets, needing only small success rates to remain profitable. Current developers focus on preventing misuse through data filtering, safety alignment, and output guardrails. Such protections fail against adversaries who control open-weight models, bypass safety controls, or develop offensive capabilities independently. We argue that AI-agent-driven cyber attacks are inevitable, requiring a fundamental shift in defensive strategy. In this position paper, we identify why existing defenses cannot stop adaptive adversaries and demonstrate that defenders must develop offensive security intelligence. We propose three actions for building frontier offensive AI capabilities responsibly. First, construct comprehensive benchmarks covering the full attack lifecycle. Second, advance from workflow-based to trained agents for discovering in-wild vulnerabilities at scale. Third, implement governance restricting offensive agents to audited cyber ranges, staging release by capability tier, and distilling findings into safe defensive-only agents. We strongly recommend treating offensive AI capabilities as essential defensive infrastructure, as containing cybersecurity risks requires mastering them in controlled settings before adversaries do.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc8fc\ub3c4\ub418\ub294 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \uacf5\uaca9\uc758 \ubd88\uac00\ud53c\uc131 \ubc0f \ubc29\uc5b4 \uc804\ub7b5\uc758 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uc804\ud658 \ud544\uc694\uc131.", "motivation": "\ud604\uc7ac \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uc804\ub7b5\uc774 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc801\ub4e4\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ubb34\ub825\ud654\ub420 \uc704\ud5d8\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc870\uce58\ub97c \uc81c\uc548: 1. \uacf5\uaca9 \uc0dd\uc560 \uc8fc\uae30\ub97c \ud3ec\uad04\ud558\ub294 \uc885\ud569\uc801 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \uad6c\ucd95; 2. \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc57c\uc0dd \ucde8\uc57d\uc810 \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac1c\ubc1c; 3. \uac10\uc0ac\ub41c \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubc94\uc704\uc5d0 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud558\ub294 \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4 \uad6c\ud604.", "result": "AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc218\ucc9c \uac1c\uc758 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uace0 \uc545\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \uacf5\uaca9\uc774 \ub354\uc6b1 \uc2ec\uac01\ud574\uc9c8 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uacf5\uaca9\uc801\uc778 AI \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uc804\ub7b5\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec \uc778\ud504\ub77c\ub85c \uac04\uc8fc\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\uc81c\ub41c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc219\ub828\ud558\uc5ec \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uad00\ub9ac\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "10\ub144 \uc774\uc0c1 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548\uc740 \uacf5\uaca9\uc790\ub97c \uace0\ubd80\uac00\uac00\uce58 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc5d0 \uc218\ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\ud55c\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uaddc\ubaa8\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucd98 \uc77c\ubc18 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud574\uc654\ub2e4. \uc815\uad50\ud55c \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\ub824\uba74 \uae4a\uc740 \uc804\ubb38 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uacfc \uc218\uc791\uc5c5 \ub178\ub825\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uba70, \ubc29\uc5b4\uc790\ub4e4\uc740 \uc801\ub4e4\uc774 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub9de\ucda4\ud615 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \uac10\ub2f9\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub2e4\uace0 \uac00\uc815\ud558\uac8c \ub41c\ub2e4.

Although the ethical principles of consent - providing information, ensuring comprehension, and ensuring voluntariness - are well-defined, the technological infrastructure remains outdated. Clinicians are responsible for obtaining informed consent from research subjects or patients, and for managing it before, during, and after clinical trials or care, which is a burden for them. The voluntary nature of participating in clinical research or undergoing medical treatment implies the need for a participant-centric consent management system. However, this is not reflected in most established systems. Not only do most healthcare information systems not follow a user-centric model, but they also create data silos, which significantly reduce the mobility of patient data between different healthcare institutions and impact personalized medicine. Furthermore, consent management tools are outdated. We propose ClinConNet (Clinical Consent Network), a platform that connects researchers and participants based on clinical research projects. ClinConNet is powered by a dynamic consent model based on blockchain and take advantage of dynamic consent interfaces, as well as blockchain and Self-Sovereign Identity systems. ClinConNet is user-centric and provides important privacy features for patients, such as unlinkability, confidentiality, and ownership of identity data. It is also compatible with the right to be forgotten, as defined in many personal data protection regulations, such as the GDPR. We provide a detailed privacy and security analysis in an adversarial model, as well as a Proof of Concept implementation with detailed performance measures that demonstrate the feasibility of our blockchain-based consent management system with a median end-to-end consent establishment time of under 200ms and a throughput of 250TPS.", "AI": {"tldr": "ClinConNet\uc740 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc790\uc640 \ucc38\uac00\uc790\ub97c \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \ub3d9\uc801 \ub3d9\uc758 \uad00\ub9ac \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc73c\ub85c, \ube14\ub85d\uccb4\uc778 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc784\uc0c1 \uc5f0\uad6c \ubc0f \uc758\ub8cc\uc5d0\uc11c \ub3d9\uc758\ub294 \uc724\ub9ac\uc801\uc778 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc694\uc18c\uc774\uba70, \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ub3d9\uc758 \uc808\ucc28\uac00 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uc5b4\uc11c \ucc38\uac00\uc790 \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \ub3d9\uc758 \uad00\ub9ac \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \ub300\ub450\ub410\ub2e4.", "method": "ClinConNet\uc740 \uc784\uc0c1 \uc5f0\uad6c \ud504\ub85c\uc81d\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc5f0\uad6c\uc790\uc640 \ucc38\uac00\uc790\ub97c \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\uba70, \ube14\ub85d\uccb4\uc778 \ubc0f \uc790\uc8fc\uad8c \uc2e0\uc6d0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \ub3d9\uc801 \ub3d9\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "ClinConNet\uc740 \uc911\uc704 \ub9d0\uc500 \ub3d9\uc758 \ud655\ub9bd \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 200ms \ubbf8\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \ucd08\ub2f9 250\uac74\uc758 \ucc98\ub9ac\ub7c9\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uc2e4\ud604 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc740 \ud658\uc790\uc5d0\uac8c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \ub9ce\uc740 \uac1c\uc778\uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \uaddc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\uc758\ub41c \uc0ad\uc81c \uad8c\ub9ac\uc640 \ud638\ud658\ub41c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub3d9\uc758\ub294 \uc784\uc0c1 \uc5f0\uad6c \ubc0f \uc77c\ubc18 \uc758\ub8cc\uc758 \uc724\ub9ac\uc801 \uae30\ucd08\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub3d9\uc758\uc758 \uc724\ub9ac\uc801 \uc6d0\uce59 - \uc815\ubcf4 \uc81c\uacf5, \uc774\ud574 \ubcf4\uc7a5 \ubc0f \uc790\ubc1c\uc131 \ubcf4\uc7a5 - \uc740 \uc798 \uc815\uc758\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc220\uc801 \uc778\ud504\ub77c\ub294 \uc624\ub798\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc784\uc0c1\uc758\ub294 \uc5f0\uad6c \ub300\uc0c1\uc790 \ub610\ub294 \ud658\uc790\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc815\ubcf4\uc5d0 \uc785\uac01\ud55c \ub3d9\uc758\ub97c \uc5bb\uace0, \uc784\uc0c1 \uc2dc\ud5d8 \ub610\ub294 \uce58\ub8cc \uc804, \uc911, \ud6c4\uc5d0 \uc774\ub97c \uad00\ub9ac\ud560 \ucc45\uc784\uc774 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uadf8\ub4e4\uc5d0\uac8c \ubd80\ub2f4\uc774 \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc784\uc0c1 \uc5f0\uad6c \ucc38\uc5ec \ub610\ub294 \uc758\ub8cc \uce58\ub8cc\uc758 \uc790\ubc1c\uc801 \uc131\uaca9\uc740 \ucc38\uc5ec\uc790 \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \ub3d9\uc758 \uad00\ub9ac \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \ub0b4\ud3ec\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub294 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \uae30\uc874 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\ub294 \ubc18\uc601\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \uc758\ub8cc \uc815\ubcf4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc911\uc2ec \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ub530\ub974\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc0ac\uc77c\ub85c\ub97c \ub9cc\ub4e4\uc5b4, \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \uc758\ub8cc \uae30\uad00 \uac04\uc758 \ud658\uc790 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc774\ub3d9\uc131\uc744 \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ucf1c \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c \uc758\ud559\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce69\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \ub3d9\uc758 \uad00\ub9ac \ub3c4\uad6c\ub294 \uad6c\uc2dd\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc790\uc640 \ucc38\uac00\uc790\ub97c \uc784\uc0c1 \uc5f0\uad6c \ud504\ub85c\uc81d\ud2b8\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uc5ec \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc778 ClinConNet(\uc784\uc0c1 \ub3d9\uc758 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

This paper introduces data-driven silicon sociology as a systematic empirical framework for studying social structure formation among interacting artificial agents. We present a pioneering large-scale data mining investigation of an in-the-wild agent society by analyzing Moltbook, a social platform designed primarily for agent-to-agent interaction. At the time of study, Moltbook hosted over 150,000 registered autonomous agents operating across thousands of agent-created sub-communities. Using programmatic and non-intrusive data acquisition, we collected and analyzed the textual descriptions of 12,758 submolts, which represent proactive sub-community partitioning activities within the ecosystem. Treating agent-authored descriptions as first-class observational artifacts, we apply rigorous preprocessing, contextual embedding, and unsupervised clustering techniques to uncover latent patterns of thematic organization and social space structuring. The results show that autonomous agents systematically organize collective space through reproducible patterns spanning human-mimetic interests, silicon-centric self-reflection, and early-stage economic and coordination behaviors. Rather than relying on predefined sociological taxonomies, these structures emerge directly from machine-generated data traces. This work establishes a methodological foundation for data-driven silicon sociology and demonstrates that data mining techniques can provide a powerful lens for understanding the organization and evolution of large autonomous agent societies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc791\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4

However, stringent privacy regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA have created data silos that prevent centralized training. Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising solution that enables collaborative model training without sharing raw patient data. Despite its potential, FL remains vulnerable to poisoning and Sybil attacks, in which malicious participants corrupt the global model or infiltrate the network using fake identities. While recent approaches integrate Blockchain technology for auditability, they predominantly rely on probabilistic reputation systems rather than robust cryptographic identity verification. This paper proposes a Trustworthy Blockchain-based Federated Learning (TBFL) framework integrating Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) standards. By leveraging Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs), our architecture ensures only authenticated healthcare entities contribute to the global model. Through comprehensive evaluation using the MIMIC-IV dataset, we demonstrate that anchoring trust in cryptographic identity verification rather than behavioral patterns significantly mitigates security risks while maintaining clinical utility. Our results show the framework successfully neutralizes 100% of Sybil attacks, achieves robust predictive performance (AUC = 0.954, Recall = 0.890), and introduces negligible computational overhead (<0.12%).

However, while smaller agents can closely match larger ones on simple tasks, it remains unclear how their performance scales with task complexity, when large models become necessary, and how to better leverage small agents for long-horizon workloads. In this work, we empirically show that small agents' performance fails to scale with task complexity on deep search and coding tasks, and we introduce Strategy Auctions for Workload Efficiency (SALE), an agent framework inspired by freelancer marketplaces. In SALE, agents bid with short strategic plans, which are scored by a systematic cost-value mechanism and refined via a shared auction memory, enabling per-task routing and continual self-improvement without training a separate router or running all models to completion. Across deep search and coding tasks of varying complexity, SALE reduces reliance on the largest agent by 53%, lowers overall cost by 35%, and consistently improves upon the largest agent's pass@1 with only a negligible overhead beyond executing the final trace. In contrast, established routers that rely on task descriptions either underperform the largest agent or fail to reduce cost -- often both -- underscoring their poor fit for agentic workflows. These results suggest that while small agents may be insufficient for complex workloads, they can be effectively \"scaled up\" through coordinated task allocation and test-time self-improvement.

However, these scores often fail to match users' day to day experience, because system prompts, output protocols, and interaction modes evolve under routine iteration, and in agentic multi step pipelines small protocol shifts can trigger disproportionate failures, leaving practitioners uncertain about which model to deploy. We propose CreditAudit, a deployment oriented credit audit framework that evaluates models under a family of semantically aligned and non adversarial system prompt templates across multiple benchmarks, reporting mean ability as average performance across scenarios and scenario induced fluctuation sigma as a stability risk signal, and further mapping volatility into interpretable credit grades from AAA to BBB via cross model quantiles with diagnostics that mitigate template difficulty drift. Controlled experiments on GPQA, TruthfulQA, and MMLU Pro show that models with similar mean ability can exhibit substantially different fluctuation, and stability risk can overturn prioritization decisions in agentic or high failure cost regimes. By providing a 2D and grade based language for regime specific selection, CreditAudit supports tiered deployment and more disciplined allocation of testing and monitoring effort, enabling more objective and trustworthy model evaluation for real world use.", "AI": {"tldr": "CreditAudit\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ub2e4\uc218\uc758 \uae30\uc900\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ubc30\ud3ec \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \uc2e0\uc6a9 \uac10\uc0ac \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ub9ac\ub354\ubcf4\ub4dc \uc810\uc218\uac00 \uac08\uc218\ub85d \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \ub3d9\ub4f1\ud574\uc9c0\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc744 \ubc18\uc601\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud574 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc120\ud0dd\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc774 \ucee4\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "CreditAudit\uc740 \uc758\ubbf8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc77c\uce58\ud558\ub294 \ube44\uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ud15c\ud50c\ub9bf\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc5ec\ub7ec \uae30\uc900\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \ud3c9\uade0 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uc774 \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, \uc548\uc815\uc131 \uc704\ud5d8\uc774 \ubc30\uce58 \uacb0\uc815\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc904 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "CreditAudit\uc740 \uacc4\uce35\ud654\ub41c \ubc30\ud3ec\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uace0 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uac1d\uad00\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4e0\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uacf5\uc2dd \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ub9ac\ub354\ubcf4\ub4dc \uc810\uc218\ub294 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0c1\uc2b9\ud558\uace0 \uc218\ub834\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ud604\uc7ac \ub9ce\uc740 \ucd5c\uc804\uc120 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ubbf8\uc138\ud55c \ucc28\uc774\ub85c \uad6c\ubd84\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc810\uc218\ub294 \uc885\uc885 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\ub4e4\uc758 \uc77c\uc0c1 \uacbd\ud5d8\uacfc \uc77c\uce58\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294\ub370, \uc774\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8, \ucd9c\ub825 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c \ubc0f \uc0c1\ud638 \uc791\uc6a9 \ubaa8\ub4dc\uac00 \uc77c\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubc1c\uc804\ud558\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc774\ub2e4. \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc18c\uaddc\ubaa8 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c \ubcc0\ud654\uac00 \ubd88\uade0\ud615\ud55c \uc2e4\ud328\ub97c \uc720\ubc1c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc2e4\ubb34\uc790\ub4e4\uc774 \uc5b4\ub5a4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ubc30\ud3ec\ud574\uc57c \ud560\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \ub0a8\uae34\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 CreditAudit\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\ub294\ub370, \uc774\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uae30\uc900\uc5d0\uc11c \uc758\ubbf8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\ub82c\ub41c \ube44\uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ud15c\ud50c\ub9bf \uc544\ub798\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ubc30\ud3ec \uc911\uc2ec \uc2e0\uc6a9 \uac10\uc0ac \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4. \ud3c9\uade0 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624 \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \ud3c9\uade0 \uc131\ub2a5\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\uace0, \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624 \uc720\ub3c4 \ubcc0\ub3d9 \uc2dc\uadf8\ub9c8\ub97c \uc548\uc815\uc131 \uc704\ud5d8 \uc2e0\ud638\ub85c \ubcf4\uace0\ud558\uba70, \ub610\ud55c \ud15c\ud50c\ub9bf \ub09c\uc774\ub3c4 \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \uc644\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc9c4\ub2e8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 AAA\ubd80\ud130 BBB\uae4c\uc9c0\uc758 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc2e0\uc6a9 \ub4f1\uae09\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc744 \ub9e4\ud551\ud55c\ub2e4.

Deploying RL in real-world settings, especially in the context of human-robot interaction, requires defining state representations and reward functions, which are critical for learning efficiency and policy performance. Traditional RL approaches often rely on domain expertise and trial-and-error, necessitating extensive human involvement as well as direct interaction with the environment, which can be costly and impractical, especially in complex and safety-critical applications. This work proposes a novel RL framework that leverages off-policy evaluation (OPE) for state space and reward function selection, using only logged interaction data. This approach eliminates the need for real-time access to the environment or human-in-the-loop feedback, greatly reducing the dependency on costly real-time interactions. The proposed approach systematically evaluates multiple candidate state representations and reward functions by training offline RL agents and applying OPE to estimate policy performance. The optimal state space and reward function are selected based on their ability to produce high-performing policies under OPE metrics. Our method is validated on two environments: the Lunar Lander environment by OpenAI Gym, which provides a controlled setting for assessing state space and reward function selection, and a NASA-MATB-II human subjects study environment, which evaluates the approach's real-world applicability to human-robot teaming scenarios. This work enhances the feasibility and scalability of offline RL for real-world environments by automating critical RL design decisions through a data-driven OPE-based evaluation, enabling more reliable, effective, and sustainable RL formulation for complex human-robot interaction settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c1\ud0dc \uacf5\uac04\uacfc \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218 \uc120\ud0dd\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud601\uc2e0\uc801\uc778 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \ud658\uacbd \uc811\uadfc \uc5c6\uc774 \ub85c\uadf8\ub41c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub9cc\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uc5ec \ud604\uc2e4 \uc138\uacc4\uc758 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ud601\uc2e0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub97c \uc2e4\uc81c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uc0c1\ud0dc \ud45c\ud604\uacfc \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218\uc758 \uc815\uc758\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 RL \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\uace0 \uc624\ud504 \ud3f4\ub9ac\uc2dc \ud3c9\uac00(OPE)\ub97c \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud6c4\ubcf4 \uc0c1\ud0dc \ud45c\ud604\uacfc \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uc0c1\ud0dc \uacf5\uac04\uacfc \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218 \uc120\ud0dd\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub192\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc758 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc0dd\uc0b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uc5ec \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uc0c1\ud0dc \uacf5\uac04\uacfc \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \uc120\ud0dd\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18 OPE \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 RL \uc124\uacc4 \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 RL\uc758 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc131\uacfc \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc778\uac04-\ub85c\ubd07 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uace0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\uba70 \uc9c0\uc18d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c RL \uacf5\uc2dd\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc740 \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\uc5ec \ud604\uc2e4 \uc138\uacc4\uc758 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ubcc0\ud654\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.

However, existing works rely on costly, unscalable manual reproduction and suffer from outdated data distributions. To address these, we present CVE-Factory, the first multi-agent framework to achieve expert-level quality in automatically transforming sparse CVE metadata into fully executable agentic tasks. Cross-validation against human expert reproductions shows that CVE-Factory achieves 95\\% solution correctness and 96\\% environment fidelity, confirming its expert-level quality. It is also evaluated on the latest realistic vulnerabilities and achieves a 66.2\\% verified success. This automation enables two downstream contributions. First, we construct LiveCVEBench, a continuously updated benchmark of 190 tasks spanning 14 languages and 153 repositories that captures emerging threats including AI-tooling vulnerabilities. Second, we synthesize over 1,000 executable training environments, the first large-scale scaling of agentic tasks in code security. Fine-tuned Qwen3-32B improves from 5.3\\% to 35.8\\% on LiveCVEBench, surpassing Claude 4.5 Sonnet, with gains generalizing to Terminal Bench (12.5\\% to 31.3\\%).

The dominant approach, Multi-Agent Path Finding, relies on centralized control and synchronous collision avoidance, which often requires strict synchronization and guarantees of globally conflict-free execution. This paper introduces the Multi-Agent Routing under Crossing Cost model on mixed graphs, a novel framework tailored to asynchronous settings. In our model, instead of treating conflicts as hard constraints, each agent is assigned a path, and the system is evaluated through a cost function that measures potential head-on encounters. This ``crossing cost'', which is defined as the product of the numbers of agents traversing an edge in opposite directions, quantifies the risk of congestion and delay in decentralized execution.\n  Our contributions are both game-theoretic and algorithmic. We model the setting as a congestion game with a non-standard cost function, prove the existence of pure Nash equilibria, and analyze the dynamics leading to them. Equilibria can be found in polynomial time under mild conditions, while the general case is PLS-complete. From an optimization perspective, minimizing the total crossing cost is NP-hard, as the problem generalizes Steiner Orientation. To address this hardness barrier, we design a suite of parameterized algorithms for minimizing crossing cost, with parameters including the number of arcs, edges, agents, and structural graph measures. These yield XP or FPT results depending on the parameter, offering algorithmic strategies for structurally restricted instances. Our framework provides a new theoretical foundation for decentralized multi-agent routing, bridging equilibrium analysis and parameterized complexity to support scalable and risk-aware coordination.",

However, these agents often struggle in specialized, tool-intensive domains that demand long-horizon execution, tight coordination across modalities, and strict adherence to implicit tool constraints. Earth Observation (EO) tasks exemplify this challenge due to the multi-modal and multi-temporal data inputs, as well as the requirements of geo-knowledge constraints (spectrum library, spatial reasoning, etc): many high-level plans can be derailed by subtle execution errors that propagate through a pipeline and invalidate final results. A core difficulty is that existing agents lack a mechanism to learn fine-grained, tool-level expertise from interaction. Without such expertise, they cannot reliably configure tool parameters or recover from mid-execution failures, limiting their effectiveness in complex EO workflows. To address this, we introduce \\textbf{GeoEvolver}, a self-evolving multi-agent system~(MAS) that enables LLM agents to acquire EO expertise through structured interaction without any parameter updates. GeoEvolver decomposes each query into independent sub-goals via a retrieval-augmented multi-agent orchestrator, then explores diverse tool-parameter configurations at the sub-goal level. Successful patterns and root-cause attribution from failures are then distilled in an evolving memory bank that provides in-context demonstrations for future queries. Experiments on three tool-integrated EO benchmarks show that GeoEvolver consistently improves end-to-end task success, with an average gain of 12\\% across multiple LLM backbones, demonstrating that EO expertise can emerge progressively from efficient, fine-grained interactions with the environment.", "AI": {"tldr": "GeoEvolver\ub294 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc9c0\uad6c \uad00\uce21 \uc804\ubb38 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc2b5\ub4dd\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc790\uac00 \uc9c4\ud654 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc678\ubd80 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uc870\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\ub294 \uc804\ubb38 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc9d1\uc57d\uc801 \uc601\uc5ed\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub2e4.", "method": "GeoEvolver\ub294 \uac01 \ucffc\ub9ac\ub97c \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \ud558\uc704 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\uace0, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \uad6c\uc131 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\uba70, \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc778 \ud328\ud134\uacfc \uc2e4\ud328\uc758 \uc6d0\uc778\uc744 \uc9c4\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ubc45\ud06c\uc5d0 \uc815\ub9ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "GeoEvolver\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub3c4\uad6c \ud1b5\ud569 EO \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uade0 12%\uc758 \uc131\uacfc \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "GeoEvolver\ub294 \ud658\uacbd\uacfc\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc138\ubc00\ud55c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 EO \uc804\ubb38 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc774 \uc810\uc9c4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd9c\ud604\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud588\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804 \ub355\ubd84\uc5d0 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc678\ubd80 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uc870\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc885\uc885 \uc7a5\uae30 \uc2e4\ud589,_modal \uac04 \ube48\ud2c8\uc5c6\ub294 \uc870\uc815 \ubc0f \uc554\ubb35\uc801 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud788 \uc900\uc218\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294 \uc804\ubb38\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc9d1\uc57d\uc801\uc778 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc9c0\uad6c \uad00\uce21(EO) \uc791\uc5c5\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ubc0f \ub2e4\uc911 \uc2dc\uac04 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc785\ub825\uacfc \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc81c\uc57d \uc0ac\ud56d(\uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc \ub77c\uc774\ube0c\ub7ec\ub9ac, \uacf5\uac04\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ub4f1)\uc758 \uc694\uad6c \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc798 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9ce\uc740 \uace0\uae09 \uacc4\ud68d\ub4e4\uc774 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc804\ud30c\ub418\ub294 \ubbf8\uc138\ud55c \uc2e4\ud589 \uc624\ub958\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ubb34\ub108\uc9c8 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud575\uc2ec \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc138\ubd80\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc804\ubb38 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc804\ubb38 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc5c6\uc774\ub294 \ub3c4\uad6c \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uc788\uac8c \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc911\uac04 \uc2e4\ud589 \uc2e4\ud328\uc5d0\uc11c \ud68c\ubcf5\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\uc5b4 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c EO \uc791\uc5c5 \ud750\ub984\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uac00 \uc81c\ud55c\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8 \uc5c6\uc774 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 EO \uc804\ubb38 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc2b5\ub4dd\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc790\uac00 \uc9c4\ud654 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc778 GeoEvolver\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, their performance degrades significantly under complex measurement noise and gross outliers. To address this issue, we propose the Noise-Adaptive Physics-Informed Neural Network (naPINN), which robustly recovers physical solutions from corrupted measurements without prior knowledge of the noise distribution. naPINN embeds an energy-based model into the training loop to learn the latent distribution of prediction residuals. Leveraging the learned energy landscape, a trainable reliability gate adaptively filters data points exhibiting high energy, while a rejection cost regularization prevents trivial solutions where valid data are discarded. We demonstrate the efficacy of naPINN on various benchmark partial differential equations corrupted by non-Gaussian noise and varying rates of outliers. The results show that naPINN significantly outperforms existing robust PINN baselines, successfully isolating outliers and accurately reconstructing the dynamics under severe data corruption.", "AI": {"tldr": "naPINN\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uce21\uc815 \uc7a1\uc74c\uacfc \uc774\uc0c1\uce58\uc5d0\uc11c \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uac15\ub825\ud558\uac8c \ubcf5\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubb3c\ub9ac\uc815\ubcf4\uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(PINNs)\uc740 \uad00\ucc30 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5ed\ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0 \uc9c0\ubc30 \ubc29\uc815\uc2dd\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uce21\uc815 \uc7a1\uc74c\uacfc \ud070 \uc774\uc0c1\uce58\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ud06c\uac8c \uc800\ud558\ub41c\ub2e4.", "method": "naPINN\uc740 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub8e8\ud504\uc5d0 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0bd\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc608\uce21 \uc794\ucc28\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uba70, \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \ud48d\uacbd\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud559\uc2b5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uac8c\uc774\ud2b8\uac00 \ub192\uc740 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0\ub97c \ubcf4\uc774\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8\ub97c \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud544\ud130\ub9c1\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uac70\ubd80 \ube44\uc6a9 \uc815\uaddc\ud654\ub294 \uc720\ud6a8\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ubc84\ub9ac\ub294 \ud2b8\ub9ac\ube44\uc5bc\ud55c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \ubc29\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc5ec\ub7ec \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ud3b8\ubbf8\ubd84 \ubc29\uc815\uc2dd\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c naPINN\uc740 \ube44\uc815\uaddc \uc7a1\uc74c\uacfc \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc774\uc0c1\uce58 \ube44\uc728\ub85c \uc624\uc5fc\ub41c \uacbd\uc6b0\uc5d0\ub3c4 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uac15\uac74\ud55c PINN \uae30\ubc18\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud6e8\uc52c \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "naPINN\uc740 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc624\uc5fc \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc774\uc0c1\uce58\ub97c \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\uace0 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\uc5b4 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubb3c\ub9ac\uc815\ubcf4\uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(PINNs)\uc740 \uad00\ucc30 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc5ed\ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0 \uc9c0\ubc30 \ubc29\uc815\uc2dd\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\ub294 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uce21\uc815 \uc7a1\uc74c\uacfc \ud070 \uc774\uc0c1\uce58\uac00 \uc788\uc744 \uacbd\uc6b0 \uadf8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ud06c\uac8c \uc800\ud558\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc7a1\uc74c \ubd84\ud3ec\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0ac\uc804 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc5c6\uc774 \uc624\uc5fc\ub41c \uce21\uc815\uac12\uc5d0\uc11c \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uac15\ub825\ud558\uac8c \ubcf5\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \uc7a1\uc74c \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc815\ubcf4\uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(naPINN)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. naPINN\uc740 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub8e8\ud504\uc5d0 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0bd\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc608\uce21 \uc794\ucc28\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \ud48d\uacbd\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \ud6c8\ub828 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uac8c\uc774\ud2b8\ub294 \ub192\uc740 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0\ub97c \ubcf4\uc774\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8\ub97c \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud544\ud130\ub9c1\ud558\uace0, \uac70\ubd80 \ube44\uc6a9 \uc815\uaddc\ud654\ub294 \uc720\ud6a8\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \ubc84\ub824\uc9c0\ub294 \ud2b8\ub9ac\ube44\uc5bc\ud55c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \ubc29\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ube44\uc815\uaddc \uc7a1\uc74c \ubc0f \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc774\uc0c1\uce58 \ube44\uc728\ub85c \uc624\uc5fc\ub41c \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ud3b8\ubbf8\ubd84 \ubc29\uc815\uc2dd\uc5d0\uc11c naPINN\uc758 \ud6a8\ub2a5\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 naPINN\uc774 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uac15\uac74\ud55c PINN \uae30\ubc18\uc744 \ud6e8\uc52c \ub2a5\uac00\ud558\uba70, \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc624\uc5fc \uc0c1\ud669\ud558\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc774\uc0c1\uce58\ub97c \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\uace0 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

In this work, we present a practical scanner for identifying sleeper agent-style backdoors in causal language models. Our approach relies on two key findings: first, sleeper agents tend to memorize poisoning data, making it possible to leak backdoor examples using memory extraction techniques. Second, poisoned LLMs exhibit distinctive patterns in their output distributions and attention heads when backdoor triggers are present in the input. Guided by these observations, we develop a scalable backdoor scanning methodology that assumes no prior knowledge of the trigger or target behavior and requires only inference operations. Our scanner integrates naturally into broader defensive strategies and does not alter model performance. We show that our method recovers working triggers across multiple backdoor scenarios and a broad range of models and fine-tuning methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI \ubcf4\uc548\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc624\uc5fc\ub418\uc5c8\ub294\uc9c0 \uac10\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8ec\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc778\uacfc\uc801 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc2ac\ub9ac\ud37c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c\uc758 \ubc31\ub3c4\uc5b4\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uc2a4\uce90\ub108\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AI \ubcf4\uc548\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa8\ub378 \uc624\uc5fc \uac10\uc9c0\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131", "method": "\uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ucd94\ucd9c \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \ubc31\ub3c4\uc5b4 \uc608\uc2dc \uc720\ucd9c \ubc0f \ucd9c\ub825 \ubd84\ud3ec \ubc0f \uc8fc\uc758 \ud5e4\ub4dc \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \ubc31\ub3c4\uc5b4 \uc2a4\uce90\ub2dd \ubc29\ubc95\ub860 \uac1c\ubc1c", "result": "\uc5ec\ub7ec \ubc31\ub3c4\uc5b4 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc640 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378 \ubc0f \ud30c\uc778\ud29c\ub2dd \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\ub3d9 \ud2b8\ub9ac\uac70\ub97c \ubcf5\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \uc131\uacfc", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc2a4\uce90\ub108\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcc0\uacbd\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uc804\ub7b5\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc624\uc5fc\ub418\uc5c8\ub294\uc9c0 \uac10\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 AI \ubcf4\uc548\uc5d0\uc11c \uc624\ub7ab\ub3d9\uc548 \uc81c\uae30\ub418\uc5b4 \uc628 \ubb38\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc778\uacfc \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2ac\ub9ac\ud37c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c\uc758 \ubc31\ub3c4\uc5b4\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uc2a4\uce90\ub108\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud575\uc2ec \ubc1c\uacac\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uccab\uc9f8, \uc2ac\ub9ac\ud37c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc624\uc5fc \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uae30\uc5b5\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc788\uc5b4 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ucd94\ucd9c \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubc31\ub3c4\uc5b4 \uc608\uc2dc\ub97c \uc720\ucd9c\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud574\uc9d1\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub458\uc9f8, \uc624\uc5fc\ub41c LLM\uc740 \uc785\ub825\uc5d0 \ubc31\ub3c4\uc5b4 \ud2b8\ub9ac\uac70\uac00 \uc788\uc744 \ub54c \ucd9c\ub825 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc640 \uc8fc\uc758 \ud5e4\ub4dc\uc5d0\uc11c \ub3c5\ud2b9\ud55c \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uad00\ucc30\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud2b8\ub9ac\uac70\ub098 \ubaa9\ud45c \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0ac\uc804 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc5c6\uc774 \ucd94\ub860 \uc791\uc5c5\ub9cc\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubc31\ub3c4\uc5b4 \uc2a4\uce90\ub2dd \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc2a4\uce90\ub108\ub294 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub113\uc740 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uc804\ub7b5\uc5d0 \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7fd\uac8c \ud1b5\ud569\ub418\uba70 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubc31\ub3c4\uc5b4 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc640 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378 \ubc0f \ud30c\uc778\ud29c\ub2dd \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\ub294 \ud2b8\ub9ac\uac70\ub97c \ubcf5\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

When a team operates in an uncoordinated manner, and agents choose actions that are only individually optimal, the team's outcome can suffer. However, in many domains, coordination requires costly communication. We explore the value of coordination in a broad class of differentiable motion-planning problems. In particular, we model coordinated behavior as a spectrum: at one extreme, agents jointly optimize a common team objective, and at the other, agents make unilaterally optimal decisions given their individual decision variables, i.e., they operate at Nash equilibria. We then demonstrate that reasoning about coordination in differentiable motion-planning problems reduces to reasoning about the second-order properties of agents' objectives, and we provide algorithms that use this second-order reasoning to determine at which times a team of agents should coordinate.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub2e4\uc911 \ub85c\ubd07 \ud300\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc6b4\uc601\uc744 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \ud611\ub3d9\uc774 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\uba70, \ud611\ub3d9\uc774 \uc5c6\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0 \ud300\uc758 \uc131\uacfc\uc5d0 \ubd80\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce60 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud611\ub3d9\uc5c6\uc774 \uac01\uac01 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc120\ud0dd\ud560 \uacbd\uc6b0 \ud300\uc758 \uc131\uacfc\uac00 \uc800\ud558\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \ub2e4\uc911 \ub85c\ubd07 \ud300\uc758 \ud611\ub3d9\uc758 \uac00\uce58\ub97c \ud0d0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud611\ub3d9 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc811\uadfc\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc758 2\ucc28 \uc18d\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucd94\ub860\uc73c\ub85c \ucd95\uc18c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc758 2\ucc28 \uc18d\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud300\uc774 \ud611\ub3d9\ud574\uc57c \ud560 \uc2dc\uc810\uc744 \uacb0\uc815\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud611\ub3d9\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uace0, \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub192\uc740 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud611\ub3d9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub2e4\uc911 \ub85c\ubd07 \ud300\uc740 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b4\uc601\ub418\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud611\ub3d9\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4. \ud300\uc774 \ube44\ud611\uc870\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b4\uc601\ub418\uace0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uac1c\uc778\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\ub9cc \uc120\ud0dd\ud560 \ub54c, \ud300\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ub098\ube60\uc9c8 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ub9ce\uc740 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud611\ub3d9\uc740 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4dc\ub294 \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubbf8\ubd84 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub3d9\uc791 \uacc4\ud68d \ubb38\uc81c\uc758 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \ud074\ub798\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \ud611\ub3d9\uc758 \uac00\uce58\ub97c \ud0d0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud611\ub3d9 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uba70, \ud55c\ucabd \uadf9\ub2e8\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uacf5\ub3d9 \ud300 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uace0, \ubc18\ub300\uadf9\ub2e8\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \uac1c\ubcc4 \uacb0\uc815 \ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uace0\ub824\ud558\uc5ec \uc77c\ubc29\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ub0b4\ub9b0\ub2e4\uace0 \uac00\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubbf8\ubd84 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub3d9\uc791 \uacc4\ud68d \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud611\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucd94\ub860\uc774 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc758 2\ucc28 \uc18d\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucd94\ub860\uc73c\ub85c \ucd95\uc18c\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uace0, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c 2\ucc28 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud300\uc774 \ud611\ub3d9\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294 \uc2dc\uc810\uc744 \uacb0\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

This paper studies how uncertainty and fairness evaluations affect the accuracy, consistency, and trustworthiness of LLM-generated recommendations. We introduce a benchmark of curated metrics and a dataset annotated for eight demographic attributes (31 categorical values) across two domains: movies and music. Through in-depth case studies, we quantify predictive uncertainty (via entropy) and demonstrate that Google DeepMind's Gemini 1.5 Flash exhibits systematic unfairness for certain sensitive attributes; measured similarity-based gaps are SNSR at 0.1363 and SNSV at 0.0507. These disparities persist under prompt perturbations such as typographical errors and multilingual inputs. We further integrate personality-aware fairness into the RecLLM evaluation pipeline to reveal personality-linked bias patterns and expose trade-offs between personalization and group fairness. We propose a novel uncertainty-aware evaluation methodology for RecLLMs, present empirical insights from deep uncertainty case studies, and introduce a personality profile-informed fairness benchmark that advances explainability and equity in LLM recommendations. Together, these contributions establish a foundation for safer, more interpretable RecLLMs and motivate future work on multi-model benchmarks and adaptive calibration for trustworthy deployment.",

Alternatives introduce coordinate-free strategies yet suffer from learning under severe data scarcity. To address the limitations, we propose ToolTok, a novel paradigm of multi-step pathfinding for GUI agents, where operations are modeled as a sequence of progressive tool usage. Specifically, we devise tools aligned with human interaction habits and represent each tool using learnable token embeddings. To enable efficient embedding learning under limited supervision, ToolTok introduces a semantic anchoring mechanism that grounds each tool with semantically related concepts as natural inductive bias. To further enable a pre-trained large language model to progressively acquire tool semantics, we construct an easy-to-hard curriculum consisting of three tasks: token definition question-answering, pure text-guided tool selection, and simplified visual pathfinding. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that ToolTok achieves superior performance among models of comparable scale (4B) and remains competitive with a substantially larger model (235B). Notably, these results are obtained using less than 1% of the training data required by other post-training approaches. In addition, ToolTok demonstrates strong generalization across unseen scenarios.

However, the external data which agent consumes also leads to the risk of indirect prompt injection attacks, where malicious instructions embedded in third-party content hijack agent behavior. Guided by benchmarks, such as AgentDojo, there has been significant amount of progress in developing defense against the said attacks. As the technology continues to mature, and that agents are increasingly being relied upon for more complex tasks, there is increasing pressing need to also evolve the benchmark to reflect threat landscape faced by emerging agentic systems. In this work, we reveal three fundamental flaws in current benchmarks and push the frontier along these dimensions: (i) lack of dynamic open-ended tasks, (ii) lack of helpful instructions, and (iii) simplistic user tasks. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgentDyn, a manually designed benchmark featuring 60 challenging open-ended tasks and 560 injection test cases across Shopping, GitHub, and Daily Life. Unlike prior static benchmarks, AgentDyn requires dynamic planning and incorporates helpful third-party instructions. Our evaluation of ten state-of-the-art defenses suggests that almost all existing defenses are either not secure enough or suffer from significant over-defense, revealing that existing defenses are still far from real-world deployment.

Moreover, most MAS communicate primarily through natural language, making them vulnerable to error accumulation and instability in long-context, multi-stage interactions within internal agent histories.\n  In this work, we propose \\textbf{Agent Primitives}, a set of reusable latent building blocks for LLM-based MAS. Inspired by neural network design, where complex models are built from reusable components, we observe that many existing MAS architectures can be decomposed into a small number of recurring internal computation patterns. Based on this observation, we instantiate three primitives: Review, Voting and Selection, and Planning and Execution. All primitives communicate internally via key-value (KV) cache, which improves both robustness and efficiency by mitigating information degradation across multi-stage interactions. To enable automatic system construction, an Organizer agent selects and composes primitives for each query, guided by a lightweight knowledge pool of previously successful configurations, forming a primitive-based MAS.\n  Experiments show that primitives-based MAS improve average accuracy by 12.0-16.5\\% over single-agent baselines, reduce token usage and inference latency by approximately 3$\\times$-4$\\times$ compared to text-based MAS, while incurring only 1.3$\\times$-1.6$\\times$ overhead relative to single-agent inference and providing more stable performance across model

We introduce PeerRank, a fully autonomous end-to-end evaluation framework in which models generate evaluation tasks, answer them with category-scoped live web grounding, judge peer responses and aggregate dense peer assessments into relative performance estimates, without human supervision or gold references. PeerRank treats evaluation as a multi-agent process where each model participates symmetrically as task designer, respondent, and evaluator, while removing biased judgments. In a large-scale study over 12 commercially available models and 420 autonomously generated questions, PeerRank produces stable, discriminative rankings and reveals measurable identity and presentation biases. Rankings are robust, and mean peer scores agree with Elo. We further validate PeerRank on TruthfulQA and GSM8K, where peer scores correlate with objective accuracy. Together, these results suggest that bias-aware peer evaluation with selective web-grounded answering can scale open-world LLM assessment beyond static and human curated benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "PeerRank\ub294 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uc644\uc804 \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc5d4\ub4dc\ud22c\uc5d4\ub4dc \ud3c9\uac00 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud3c9\uac00 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uc6f9 \uae30\ubc18 \uc815\ubcf4\uc5d0 \uadfc\uac70\ud558\uc5ec \ub2f5\ubcc0\ud558\uba70, \ub3d9\ub8cc\uc758 \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0, \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \ub3d9\ub8cc \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc9d1\uacc4\ud558\uc5ec \uc0c1\ub300\uc801 \uc131\uacfc \ucd94\uc815\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc778\uc801 \uae30\ubc18 \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ub2e8\uc810\uc774 \ub9ce\uc544 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub2e4.", "method": "PeerRank\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud3c9\uac00 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uce74\ud14c\uace0\ub9ac \ubc94\uc704\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \uc6f9 \uae30\ubc18 \uc815\ubcf4\ub85c \uc774 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub2f5\ubcc0\ud558\uba70, \ub3d9\ub8cc\uc758 \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \ud310\ub2e8\ud558\uace0 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc9d1\uacc4\ud558\ub294 \uc644\uc804 \uc790\uc728\uc801 \ud3c9\uac00 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "12\uac1c\uc758 \uc0c1\uc5c5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc 420\uac1c\uc758 \uc790\uc728 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c, PeerRank\ub294 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ucc28\ubcc4\ud654\ub41c \uc21c\uc704\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uc54c\ub824\uc9c4 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "PeerRank\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud3b8\ud5a5 \uc778\uc2dd \ub3d9\ub8cc \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc0f \uc120\ud0dd\uc801 \uc6f9 \uae30\ubc18 \ub2f5\ubcc0\uc774 \uace0\uc815\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc778\uac04\uc774 \uc120\ubcc4\ud55c \uae30\uc900\uc744 \ub118\uc5b4 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \ud655\uc7a5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\uac04\uc774 \uc791\uc131\ud55c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c, \ucc38\uc870 \ub2f5\ubcc0 \ubc0f \uc778\uac04 \ub610\ub294 \ub2e8\uc77c \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud310\ub2e8\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294\ub370, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc774 \ub5a8\uc5b4\uc9c0\uace0 \ube60\ub974\uac8c \uc2dc\ub300\uc5d0 \ub4a4\ub5a8\uc5b4\uc9c0\uba70 \uc6f9 \uac80\uc0c9 \ubc0f \uc885\ud569\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294 \uac1c\ubc29\ud615 \ubc30\uce58\uc640 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud3c9\uac00 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uce74\ud14c\uace0\ub9ac \ubc94\uc704\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \uc6f9 \uae30\ubc18 \uc9c0\uc6d0\uc73c\ub85c \ub2f5\ubcc0\ud558\uba70 \ub3d9\ub8cc\uc758 \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uac10\ub3c5\uc774\ub098 \uae08\ubcf8\uc704 \uae30\uc900 \uc5c6\uc774 \ubc00\uc811\ud55c \ub3d9\ub8cc \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc0c1\ub300 \uc131\uacfc \ucd94\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \uc9d1\uacc4\ud558\ub294 \uc644\uc804 \uc790\uc728 \uc5d4\ub4dc\ud22c\uc5d4\ub4dc \ud3c9\uac00 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 PeerRank\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.

Standing at the frontier of this effort is Sybil, a deep learning model capable of predicting future risk solely from computed tomography (CT) with high precision. However, despite extensive clinical validation, current assessments rely purely on observational metrics. This correlation-based approach overlooks the model's actual reasoning mechanism, necessitating a shift to causal verification to ensure robust decision-making before clinical deployment. We propose S(H)NAP, a model-agnostic auditing framework that constructs generative interventional attributions validated by expert radiologists. By leveraging realistic 3D diffusion bridge modeling to systematically modify anatomical features, our approach isolates object-specific causal contributions to the risk score. Providing the first interventional audit of Sybil, we demonstrate that while the model often exhibits behavior akin to an expert radiologist, differentiating malignant pulmonary nodules from benign ones, it suffers from critical failure modes, including dangerous sensitivity to clinically unjustified artifacts and a distinct radial bias.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 Sybil\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc2ec\uce35 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uac1c\uc785 \uac10\uc0ac \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 S(H)NAP\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec CT \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \ud3d0\uc554 \uc704\ud5d8 \uc608\uce21\uc758 \uc778\uacfc\uc801 \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud3d0\uc554\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc554 \uc0ac\ub9dd\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc6d0\uc778\uc73c\ub85c, \ubc29\uc0ac\uc120 \uc804\ubb38\uc758\uc758 \uc5c5\ubb34 \ubd80\ub2f4\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc790\ub3d9\ud654 \uc2a4\ud06c\ub9ac\ub2dd \ub3c4\uad6c \uac1c\ubc1c\uc774 \uc694\uad6c\ub41c\ub2e4.", "method": "S(H)NAP\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378-\ubd88\uac00\uc9c0\ub860\uc801 \uac10\uc0ac \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \ubc29\uc0ac\uc120\uc758\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uac80\uc99d\ub41c \uc0dd\uc131\uc801 \uac1c\uc785 \uadc0\uc18d\uc744 \uc791\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "Sybil\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \uac1c\uc785 \uac10\uc0ac\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc885\uc885 \ubc29\uc0ac\uc120 \uc804\ubb38\uc758\uc640 \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\ub098, \uce58\ub8cc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd80\uc801\uc808\ud55c \uc544\ud2f0\ud329\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ubbfc\uac10\ud558\uace0 \ub69c\ub837\ud55c \ubc29\uc0ac\uc0c1 \ud3b8\ud5a5 \ub4f1 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \uc2e4\ud328 \ubaa8\ub4dc\uac00 \uc874\uc7ac\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc778\uacfc\uc801 \uac80\uc99d\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \uc804\ud658\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud3d0\uc554\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc554 \uc0ac\ub9dd\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc6d0\uc778\uc73c\ub85c \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ubc29\uc0ac\uc120 \uc804\ubb38\uc758\uc758 \uc5c5\ubb34 \ubd80\ub2f4\uc744 \ub35c\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uc2a4\ud06c\ub9ac\ub2dd \ub3c4\uad6c \uac1c\ubc1c\uc774 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub178\ub825\uc758 \ucd5c\uc804\uc120\uc5d0 \uc788\ub294 Sybil\uc740 \uace0\uc815\ubc00 CT\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c \ubbf8\ub798 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc2ec\uce35 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc784\uc0c1 \uac80\uc99d\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \ud604\uc7ac \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc21c\uc804\ud788 \uad00\ucc30 \uc9c0\ud45c\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4 \uae30\ubc18 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \ucd94\ub860 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uac04\uacfc\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc5b4, \uc784\uc0c1 \ubc30\uce58\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc778\uacfc\uc801 \uac80\uc99d\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \uc804\ud658\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \ubc29\uc0ac\uc120\uc758\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uac80\uc99d\ub41c \uc0dd\uc131\uc801 \uac1c\uc785 \uadc0\uc18d\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378-\ubd88\uac00\uc9c0\ub860\uc801 \uac10\uc0ac \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 S(H)NAP\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc0ac\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 3D \ud655\uc0b0 \ube0c\ub9ac\uc9c0 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud574\ubd80\ud559\uc801 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\uc815\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc704\ud5d8 \uc810\uc218\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac1d\uccb4 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc778\uacfc \uae30\uc5ec\ub97c \ubd84\ub9ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Unlike traditional bugs such as reentrancy or arithmetic errors, these vulnerabilities arise from missing or incorrectly enforced business invariants and are tightly coupled with protocol semantics. Existing static analysis techniques struggle to capture such high-level logic, while recent large language model based approaches often suffer from unstable outputs and low accuracy due to hallucination and limited verification.\n  In this paper, we propose LogicScan, an automated contrastive auditing framework for detecting business logic vulnerabilities in smart contracts. The key insight behind LogicScan is that mature, widely deployed on-chain protocols implicitly encode well-tested and consensus-driven business invariants. LogicScan systematically mines these invariants from large-scale on-chain contracts and reuses them as reference constraints to audit target contracts. To achieve this, LogicScan introduces a Business Specification Language (BSL) to normalize diverse implementation patterns into structured, verifiable logic representations. It further combines noise-aware logic aggregation with contrastive auditing to identify missing or weakly enforced invariants while mitigating LLM-induced false positives.\n  We evaluate LogicScan on three real-world datasets, including DeFiHacks, Web3Bugs, and a set of top-200 audited contracts. The results show that LogicScan achieves an F1 score of 85.2%, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art tools while maintaining a low false-positive rate on production-grade contracts. Additional experiments demonstrate that LogicScan maintains consistent performance across different LLMs and is cost-effective, and that its false-positive suppression mechanisms substantially improve robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uacc4\uc57d\uc5d0\uc11c \ube44\uc988\ub2c8\uc2a4 \ub85c\uc9c1 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ub300\uc870 \uac10\uc0ac \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 LogicScan\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ube44\uc988\ub2c8\uc2a4 \ub85c\uc9c1 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc740 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uacc4\uc57d\uc758 \uac00\uc7a5 \ud30c\uad34\uc801\uc774\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uac00\uc7a5 \uc774\ud574\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud55c \ucde8\uc57d\uc810 \uc911 \ud558\ub098\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "LogicScan\uc740 \ube44\uc988\ub2c8\uc2a4 \uc0ac\uc591 \uc5b8\uc5b4(BSL)\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0, \ucc44\ub110 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uacc4\uc57d\uc5d0\uc11c \ube44\uc988\ub2c8\uc2a4 \ubd88\ubcc0\ub7c9\uc744 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "LogicScan\uc740 F1 \uc810\uc218 85.2%\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \ucd5c\uc2e0 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub4e4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "LogicScan\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c LLM\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba70 \ube44\uc6a9 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ube44\uc988\ub2c8\uc2a4 \ub85c\uc9c1 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc740 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uacc4\uc57d \ucde8\uc57d\uc810 \uc911 \uac00\uc7a5 \ud30c\uad34\uc801\uc774\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uac00\uc7a5 \uc774\ud574\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud55c \ud074\ub798\uc2a4\uac00 \ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc7ac\uc9c4\uc785\uc774\ub098 \uc0b0\uc220 \uc624\ub958\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ubc84\uadf8\uc640 \ub2ec\ub9ac, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc740 \ube44\uc988\ub2c8\uc2a4 \ubd88\ubcc0\ub7c9\uc758 \ub204\ub77d\uc774\ub098 \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \uc2dc\ud589\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uba70 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c \uc758\ubbf8\uc640 \ubc00\uc811\ud558\uac8c \uc5f0\uacb0\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc815\uc801 \ubd84\uc11d \uae30\uc220\uc740 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uace0\uae09 \ub85c\uc9c1\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ucd5c\uadfc\uc758 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ud658\uac01\uacfc \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uac80\uc99d\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc885\uc885 \ubd88\uc548\uc815\ud55c \ucd9c\ub825\uacfc \ub0ae\uc740 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc5d0 \uc2dc\ub2ec\ub9bd\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uacc4\uc57d\uc5d0\uc11c \ube44\uc988\ub2c8\uc2a4 \ub85c\uc9c1 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ub300\uc870 \uac10\uc0ac \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 LogicScan\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

MARS relies on three pillars: (1) Budget-Aware Planning via cost-constrained Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to explicitly balance performance with execution expense; (2) Modular Construction, employing a \"Design-Decompose-Implement\" pipeline to manage complex research repositories; and (3) Comparative Reflective Memory, which addresses credit assignment by analyzing solution differences to distill high-signal insights. MARS achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source frameworks on MLE-Bench under comparable settings, maintaining competitiveness with the global leaderboard's top methods. Furthermore, the system exhibits qualitative \"Aha!\" moments, where 63% of all utilized lessons originate from cross-branch transfer, demonstrating that the agent effectively generalizes insights across search paths.", "AI": {"tldr": "MARS\ub294 \uc608\uc0b0\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud55c \ud50c\ub798\ub2dd, \ubaa8\ub4c8\ud654\ub41c \uad6c\uc870, \ube44\uad50 \ubc18\uc601 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc790\uc728 AI \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AI \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub294 \ud3c9\uac00 \ube44\uc6a9\uacfc \ubd88\ud22c\uba85\ud55c \uc131\uacfc \ud560\ub2f9\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc77c\ubc18 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uacf5\ud559\uacfc \ub2e4\ub974\ub2e4.", "method": "MARS\ub294 \ube44\uc6a9 \uc81c\uc57d \ubaac\ud14c \uce74\ub97c\ub85c \ud2b8\ub9ac \uac80\uc0c9, \ub514\uc790\uc778-\ubd84\ud574-\uad6c\ud604 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778, \uc194\ub8e8\uc158 \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc5ec \ud06c\ub808\ub527 \ud560\ub2f9\uc744 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \ube44\uad50 \ubc18\uc601 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\ub77c\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uae30\ub465\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "MARS\ub294 \ub3d9\ub4f1\ud55c \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c MLE-Bench\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc624\ud508 \uc18c\uc2a4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c \uc911\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "MARS\ub294 \uac80\uc0c9 \uacbd\ub85c \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0\uc11c \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, 63%\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5\uc774 \ud06c\ub85c\uc2a4 \ube0c\ub79c\uce58 \uc804\uc774\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "AI \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub294 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4dc\ub294 \ud3c9\uac00(\uc608: \ubaa8\ub378 \ud6c8\ub828)\uc640 \ubd88\ud22c\uba85\ud55c \uc131\uacfc \uadc0\uc18d\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc77c\ubc18 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uacf5\ud559\uacfc \ub2e4\ub985\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc5ec\uae30\uc11c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc2e4\ud589 \ube44\uc6a9\uacfc \uc778\uacfc\uc801 \uc694\uc778\uc744 \ubb34\uc2dc\ud558\ub294 \uc77c\uccb4\ud615 \uc2a4\ud06c\ub9bd\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc790\uc728 AI \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 MARS(\ubaa8\ub4c8\ud615 \ubc18\uc0ac \uac80\uc0c9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8)\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Traditional human-centric pipelines are costly, slow, and prone to annotator variability, motivating reliability-aware automated annotation. We present AURA (Agentic AI for Unified Reliability Modeling and Annotation Aggregation), an agentic AI framework for large-scale, multi-modal data annotation. AURA coordinates multiple AI agents to generate and validate labels without requiring ground truth. At its core, AURA adapts a classical probabilistic model that jointly infers latent true labels and annotator reliability via confusion matrices, using Expectation-Maximization to reconcile conflicting annotations and aggregate noisy predictions. Across the four benchmark datasets evaluated, AURA achieves accuracy improvements of up to 5.8% over baseline. In more challenging settings with poor quality annotators, the improvement is up to 50% over baseline. AURA also accurately estimates the reliability of annotators, allowing assessment of annotator quality even without any pre-validation steps.", "AI": {"tldr": "AURA\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc8fc\uc11d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c AI \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc8fc\uc11d\uc790\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud558\uc5ec \ub178\uc774\uc988\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc9d1\uacc4\ud558\uace0 \ud488\uc9c8 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc774 \ucee4\uc9c0\uace0 \ub2e4\uc591\ud574\uc9d0\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc815\ud655\ud558\uace0 \uacf5\uc815\ud558\uba70 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub77c\ubca8 \uc0dd\uc0b0\uc774 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6cc\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "AURA\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc870\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\uc81c \uc9c4\uc2e4 \uc5c6\uc774 \ub77c\ubca8\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uba70, \ud63c\ub3c8 \ud589\ub82c\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc228\uaca8\uc9c4 \uc9c4\uc815 \ub77c\ubca8\uacfc \uc8fc\uc11d\uc790 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ucd94\ub860\ud558\ub294 \ud074\ub798\uc2dd\ud55c \ud655\ub960 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "AURA\ub294 \ud3c9\uac00\ub41c \ub124 \uac1c\uc758 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc900\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ucd5c\ub300 5.8%\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc73c\uba70, \ud488\uc9c8\uc774 \ub0ae\uc740 \uc8fc\uc11d\uc790\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uae30\uc900 \ub300\ube44 \ucd5c\ub300 50% \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc774 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc84c\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "AURA\ub294 \uc8fc\uc11d\uc790\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \ucd94\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \uc0ac\uc804 \uac80\uc99d \ub2e8\uacc4 \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 \uc8fc\uc11d \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc8fc\uc11d\uc740 \uc9c0\ub3c4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc774 \ud06c\uace0 \ub2e4\uc591\ud574\uc9d0\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc815\ud655\ud558\uace0 \ud3b8\ud5a5\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba70 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub77c\ubca8\uc744 \uc0dd\uc0b0\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc778\uac04 \uc911\uc2ec \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc740 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4e4\uace0 \ub290\ub9ac\uba70 \uc8fc\uc11d\uc790 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc774 \ud070 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud55c \uc790\ub3d9 \uc8fc\uc11d\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 AURA(\ud1b5\ud569 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \ubc0f \uc8fc\uc11d \uc9d1\uacc4\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801 AI)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, MCP does not enforce consistency between documented tool behavior and actual code execution, even though MCP Servers often run with broad system privileges. This gap introduces a largely unexplored security risk. We study how mismatches between externally presented tool descriptions and underlying implementations systematically shape the mental models and decision-making behavior of intelligent agents. Specifically, we present the first large-scale study of description-code inconsistency in the MCP ecosystem. We design an automated static analysis framework and apply it to 10,240 real-world MCP Servers across 36 categories. Our results show that while most servers are highly consistent, approximately 13% exhibit substantial mismatches that can enable undocumented privileged operations, hidden state mutations, or unauthorized financial actions. We further observe systematic differences across application categories, popularity levels, and MCP marketplaces. Our findings demonstrate that description-code inconsistency is a concrete and prevalent attack surface in MCP-based AI agents, and motivate the need for systematic auditing and stronger transparency

We propose ATLAS (Adaptive Task-distributed Learning for Agentic Self-evolution), a task-distributed framework that iteratively develops a lightweight research agent while delegating complementary roles to specialized supporter agents for exploration, hyperparameter tuning, and reference policy management. Our core algorithm, Evolving Direct Preference Optimization (EvoDPO), adaptively updates the phase-indexed reference policy. We provide a theoretical regret analysis for a preference-based contextual bandit under concept drift. In addition, experiments were conducted on non-stationary linear contextual bandits and scientific machine learning (SciML) loss reweighting for the 1D Burgers' equation.

Despite plausible codes generated by LLMs, producing solutions that meet the stringent correctness and performance requirements of systems demands iterative optimization. Test-time reinforcement learning offers high search efficiency but requires parameter updates infeasible under API-only access, while existing training-free evolutionary methods suffer from inefficient context utilization and undirected search. We introduce ContextEvolve, a multi-agent framework that achieves RL-level search efficiency under strict parameter-blind constraints by decomposing optimization context into three orthogonal dimensions: a Summarizer Agent condenses semantic state via code-to-language abstraction, a Navigator Agent distills optimization direction from trajectory analysis, and a Sampler Agent curates experience distribution through prioritized exemplar retrieval.

Existing Electronic Design Automation (EDA) methods typically frame sizing as static black-box optimization, resulting in inefficient and less robust solutions. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning abilities, they are not suited for precise numerical optimization in AMS sizing. To address this gap, we propose AutoSizer, a reflective LLM-driven meta-optimization framework that unifies circuit understanding, adaptive search-space construction, and optimization orchestration in a closed loop. It employs a two-loop optimization framework, with an inner loop for circuit sizing and an outer loop that analyzes optimization dynamics and constraints to iteratively refine the search space from simulation feedback. We further introduce AMS-SizingBench, an open benchmark comprising 24 diverse AMS circuits in SKY130 CMOS technology, designed to evaluate adaptive optimization policies under realistic simulator-based constraints.

The core bottleneck lies in the scarcity of training data that captures authentic long-dependency structures and cross-stage evolutionary dynamics--existing synthesis methods either confine to single-feature scenarios constrained by model distribution, or incur prohibitive human annotation costs, failing to provide scalable, high-quality supervision. We address this by reconceptualizing data synthesis through the lens of real-world software evolution. Our key insight: Pull Request (PR) sequences naturally embody the supervision signals for long-horizon learning. They decompose complex objectives into verifiable submission units, maintain functional coherence across iterations, and encode authentic refinement patterns through bug-fix histories. Building on this, we propose daVinci-Agency, which systematically mines structured supervision from chain-of-PRs through three interlocking mechanisms: (1) progressive task decomposition via continuous commits, (2) long-term consistency enforcement through unified functional objectives, and (3) verifiable refinement from authentic bug-fix trajectories. Unlike synthetic trajectories that treat each step independently, daVinci-Agency's PR-grounded structure inherently preserves the causal dependencies and iterative refinements essential for teaching persistent goal-directed behavior and enables natural alignment with project-level, full-cycle task modeling. The resulting trajectories are substantial--averaging 85k tokens and 116 tool calls--yet remarkably data-efficient: fine-tuning GLM-4.6 on 239 daVinci-Agency samples yields broad improvements across benchmarks, notably achieving a 47% relative gain on Toolathlon.

Classical approaches like differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) add noise to gradients but fail to exploit the unique properties of quantum gradient estimation. In this work, we introduce the Differentially Private Parameter-Shift Rule (Q-ShiftDP), the first privacy mechanism tailored to QML. By leveraging the inherent boundedness and stochasticity of quantum gradients computed via the parameter-shift rule, Q-ShiftDP enables tighter sensitivity analysis and reduces noise requirements. We combine carefully calibrated Gaussian noise with intrinsic quantum noise to provide formal privacy and utility guarantees, and show that harnessing quantum noise further improves the privacy-utility trade-off. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that Q-ShiftDP consistently outperforms classical DP methods in QML.", "AI": {"tldr": "Q-ShiftDP\ub294 \uc591\uc790 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\ub294 \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc73c\ub85c, \uc591\uc790 \uacbd\ub7c9 \ucd94\uc815\uc758 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \ubc0f \uc720\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc591\uc790 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5(QML)\uc758 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc801 \uc7a5\uc810\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638\ub294 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc591\uc790 \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \uc774\ub3d9 \uaddc\uce59\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud574 \uace0\uc720\ud55c \uacbd\ub7c9 \ucd94\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub354 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ubbfc\uac10\ub3c4 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uace0, \uac00\uc6b0\uc2dc\uc548 \ub178\uc774\uc988\uc640 \uc591\uc790 \ub178\uc774\uc988\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \ubc0f \uc720\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 Q-ShiftDP\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, Q-ShiftDP\ub294 QML\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ucc28\ub4f1 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638(DP) \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud56d\uc0c1 \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub530\ub77c\uc11c Q-ShiftDP\ub294 \uc591\uc790 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638\uc640 \uc720\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc591\uc790 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5(QML)\uc740 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uacc4\uc0b0\uc801 \uc774\uc810\uc744 \uc57d\uc18d\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucc28\ub4f1 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uacbd\ub7c9 \ud558\uac15\ubc95(DP-SGD)\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uace0\uc804\uc801\uc778 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uacbd\ub7c9\uc5d0 \ub178\uc774\uc988\ub97c \ucd94\uac00\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc591\uc790 \uacbd\ub7c9 \ucd94\uc815\uc758 \ub3c5\ud2b9\ud55c \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc9c0\ub294 \ubabb\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 QML\uc5d0 \ub9de\uac8c \uc870\uc815\ub41c \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc778 \ucc28\ub4f1 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \uc774\ub3d9 \uaddc\uce59(Q-ShiftDP)\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

To address these limitations, we propose MAS4TS, a tool-driven multi-agent system for general time series tasks, built upon an Analyzer-Reasoner-Executor paradigm that integrates agent communication, visual reasoning, and latent reconstruction within a unified framework. MAS4TS first performs visual reasoning over time series plots with structured priors using a Vision-Language Model to extract temporal structures, and subsequently reconstructs predictive trajectories in latent space. Three specialized agents coordinate via shared memory and gated communication, while a router selects task-specific tool chains for execution.

Process verification, which evaluates intermediate steps in trajectories, has shown promise in general reasoning settings, and has been suggested as a potential tool for guiding coordination of MAS; however, its actual effectiveness in MAS remains unclear. To fill this gap, we present MAS-ProVe, a systematic empirical study of process verification for multi-agent systems (MAS). Our study spans three verification paradigms (LLM-as-a-Judge, reward models, and process reward models), evaluated across two levels of verification granularity (agent-level and iteration-level). We further examine five representative verifiers and four context management strategies, and conduct experiments over six diverse MAS frameworks on multiple reasoning benchmarks. We find that process-level verification does not consistently improve performance and frequently exhibits high variance, highlighting the difficulty of reliably evaluating partial multi-agent trajectories. Among the methods studied, LLM-as-a-Judge generally outperforms reward-based approaches, with trained judges surpassing general-purpose LLMs. We further observe a small performance gap between LLMs acting as judges and as single agents, and identify a context-length-performance trade-off in verification. Overall, our results suggest that effective and robust process verification for MAS remains an open challenge, requiring further advances beyond current paradigms.

Existing benchmarks face a trade-off: they either heavily rely on LLM-as-judge evaluations of automatically generated research outputs or optimize convenient yet isolated performance metrics that provide coarse proxies for scientific insight. To address this gap, we introduce FIRE-Bench (Full-cycle Insight Rediscovery Evaluation), a benchmark that evaluates agents through the rediscovery of established findings from recent, high-impact machine learning research. Agents are given only a high-level research question extracted from a published, verified study and must autonomously explore ideas, design experiments, implement code, execute their plans, and derive conclusions supported by empirical evidence. We evaluate a range of state-of-the-art agents with frontier LLMs backbones like gpt-5 on FIRE-Bench. Our results show that full-cycle scientific research remains challenging for current agent systems: even the strongest agents achieve limited rediscovery success (<50 F1), exhibit high variance across runs, and display recurring failure modes in experimental design, execution, and evidence-based reasoning. FIRE-Bench provides a rigorous and diagnostic framework for measuring progress toward reliable agent-driven scientific discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "FIRE-Bench\ub294 \uc790\uc728

In this study, we analyze data from the Xenium platform, which captures high-resolution images of tumor microarray (TMA) tissues and converts them into cell-by-gene matrices suitable for computational analysis. We benchmark and extend nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) for spatial transcriptomics by introducing two spatially regularized variants. First, we propose Spatial NMF (SNMF), a lightweight baseline that enforces local spatial smoothness by diffusing each cell's NMF factor vector over its spatial neighborhood. Second, we introduce Hybrid Spatial NMF (hSNMF), which performs spatially regularized NMF followed by Leiden clustering on a hybrid adjacency that integrates spatial proximity (via a contact-radius graph) and transcriptomic similarity through a tunable mixing parameter alpha. Evaluated on a cholangiocarcinoma dataset, SNMF and hSNMF achieve markedly improved spatial compactness (CHAOS < 0.004, Moran's I > 0.96), greater cluster separability (Silhouette > 0.12, DBI < 1.8), and higher biological coherence (CMC and enrichment) compared to other spatial baselines.

Namely, it takes into account two ideas that have received little attention in the literature on computational argumentation: First, an agent may rationally reject an argument based on mere doubt, thus not all arguments they could defend must be accepted; and, second, that it is sometimes more natural to think in terms of which individual sentences or claims an agent accepts in a debate, rather than which arguments. In order to incorporate these two ideas into a computational approach, we first define the notion of structured bipolar argumentation frameworks (SBAFs), where arguments consist of sentences and we have both an attack and a support relation between them. Then, we provide semantics for SBAFs with two features: (1) Unlike with completeness-based semantics, our semantics do not force agents to accept all defended arguments. (2) In addition to argument extensions, which give acceptable sets of arguments, we also provide semantics for language extensions that specify acceptable sets of sentences. These semantics represent reasonable positions an agent might have in a debate. Our semantics lie between the admissible and complete semantics of abstract argumentation. Further, our approach can be used to provide a new perspective on existing approaches. For instance, we can specify the conditions under which an agent can ignore support between arguments (i.e. under which the use of abstract argumentation is warranted) and we show that deductive support semantics is a special case of our approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ucca0\ud559\uc801 \ubc0f \uc5b8\uc5b4\uc801 \uad00\uc810\uc744 \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc801 \ub17c\uc99d \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uacc4\uc0b0\uc801 \ub17c\uc99d \ubb38\ud5cc\uc5d0\uc11c \uc8fc\ubaa9\ubc1b\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc544\uc774\ub514\uc5b4\ub97c \uace0\ub824\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "\uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc30d\uadf9\uc801 \ub17c\uc99d \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c(SBAFs)\ub97c \uc815\uc758\ud558\uace0, \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ubc29\uc5b4\ub41c \ub17c\uc99d\uc744 \uc218\uc6a9\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc5c6\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uad00\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ucca0\ud559\uc801 \ubc0f \uc5b8\uc5b4\uc801 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc81c\uacf5\ub418\ub294 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc801 \ub17c\uc99d\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc989, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \uc758\uc2ec\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c \ub17c\uc99d\uc744 \ud569\ub9ac\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac70\ubd80\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uadf8\ub4e4\uc774 \ubc29\uc5b4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ub17c\uc99d\uc744 \uc218\uc6a9\ud574\uc57c \ud560 \ud544\uc694\ub294 \uc5c6\ub2e4\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc544\uc774\ub514\uc5b4\ub97c \uace0\ub824\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \ub17c\uc99d \ub300\uc2e0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ub17c\uc758\uc5d0\uc11c \uc218\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac1c\ubcc4 \ubb38\uc7a5 \ub610\ub294 \uc8fc\uc7a5\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc0dd\uac01\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ub354 \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7ec\uc6b8 \ub54c\uac00 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc544\uc774\ub514\uc5b4\ub97c \ucef4\ud4e8\ud130 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub17c\uc99d\uc774 \ubb38\uc7a5\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub418\uace0 \uacf5\uaca9 \ubc0f \uc9c0\uc9c0 \uad00\uacc4\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc30d\uadf9\uc801 \ub17c\uc99d \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c(SBAFs)\uc758 \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \uc815\uc758\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7f0 \ub2e4\uc74c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 SBAFs\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: (1) \uc644\uc804\uc131 \uae30\ubc18 \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uacfc \ub2ec\ub9ac, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ubc29\uc5b4\ub41c \ub17c\uc99d\uc744 \uc218\uc6a9\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uac15\uc81c\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

In this work, we first formalize the evolutionary agents as a general Expectation-Maximization framework, where the language model samples candidate programs (E-step) and the system updates the control context based on evaluation feedback (M-step). Under this view, constructing context via full-code snapshots constitutes a suboptimal M-step, as redundant implement details dilutes core algorithmic ideas, making it difficult to provide clear inspirations for evolution. To address this, we propose DeltaEvolve, a momentum-driven evolutionary framework that replaces full-code history with structured semantic delta capturing how and why modifications between successive nodes affect performance. As programs are often decomposable, semantic delta usually contains many effective components which are transferable and more informative to drive improvement. By organizing semantic delta through multi-level database and progressive disclosure mechanism, input tokens are further reduced.

Achieving long-horizon goals in complex environments remains a core challenge in Reinforcement Learning (RL). Domains with multiple entities are particularly difficult due to their combinatorial complexity. GCRL facilitates generalization across goals and the use of subgoal structure, but struggles with high-dimensional observations and combinatorial state-spaces, especially under sparse reward. We employ a two-level hierarchy composed of a value-based GCRL agent and a factored subgoal-generating conditional diffusion model. The RL agent and subgoal generator are trained independently and composed post hoc through selective subgoal generation based on the value function, making the approach modular and compatible with existing GCRL algorithms. We introduce new variations to benchmark tasks that highlight the challenges of multi-entity domains, and show that our method consistently boosts performance of the underlying RL agent on image-based long-horizon tasks with sparse rewards, achieving over 150% higher success rates on the hardest task in our suite and generalizing to increasing horizons and numbers of entities.

Unlike traditional search engines that match keywords to documents, these systems infer user intent, synthesize multimodal evidence, and generate contextual answers directly on the search page, introducing a paradigm shift from Search Engine Optimization (SEO) to Generative Engine Optimization (GEO). For visual content platforms hosting billions of assets, this poses an acute challenge: individual images lack the semantic depth and authority signals that generative search prioritizes, risking disintermediation as user needs are satisfied in-place without site visits.\n  We present Pinterest GEO, a production-scale framework that pioneers reverse search design: rather than generating generic image captions describing what content is, we fine-tune Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to predict what users would actually search for, augmented this with AI agents that mine real-time internet trends to capture emerging search demand.

Early detection of swallowing abnormalities, also known as dysphagia, is crucial for timely intervention. However, current diagnostic methods often rely on radiographic imaging or invasive procedures. In this study, we propose an automated framework for detecting dysphagia using portable and noninvasive acoustic sensing coupled with applied machine learning. By capturing subtle acoustic signals from the neck during swallowing tasks, we aim to identify patterns associated with abnormal physiological conditions. Our approach achieves promising test-time abnormality detection performance, with an AUC-ROC of 0.904 under 5 independent train-test splits.

In this paper, we introduce Agent Alpha, a unified framework that synergizes generation, exploration, and evaluation through step-level Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). It enables active modeling or exploiting structures of the planning space. By integrating alpha-UCT guided search into the interaction loop, Agent Alpha enables deliberate planning, facilitating early pruning of suboptimal branches and efficient prefix reuse.

Under Review", "summary": "Geometric data pruning methods, while practical for leveraging pretrained models, are fundamentally unstable. Their reliance on extrinsic geometry renders them highly sensitive to latent space perturbations, causing performance to degrade during cross-architecture transfer or in the presence of feature noise. We introduce TopoPrune, a framework which resolves this challenge by leveraging topology to capture the stable, intrinsic structure of data. TopoPrune operates at two scales, (1) utilizing a topology-aware manifold approximation to establish a global low-dimensional embedding of the dataset. Subsequently, (2) it employs differentiable persistent homology to perform a local topological optimization on the manifold embeddings, ranking samples by their structural complexity. We demonstrate that our unified dual-scale topological approach ensures high accuracy and precision, particularly at significant dataset pruning rates (e.g., 90%). Furthermore, through the inherent stability properties of topology, TopoPrune is (a) exceptionally robust to noise perturbations of latent feature embeddings and (b) demonstrates superior transferability across diverse network architectures. This study demonstrates a promising avenue towards stable and principled topology-based frameworks for robust data-efficient learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "TopoPrune\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ub0b4\uc7ac\uc801 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uac00\uc9c0 \uce58\uae30\uc758 \ubd88\uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uac00\uc9c0 \uce58\uae30 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ubd88\uc548\uc815\uc131\uc774 \ud06c\uace0, \uc678\ubd80 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \uc7a0\uc7ac \uacf5\uac04\uc758 pertubation\uc5d0 \ubbfc\uac10\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "TopoPrune\uc740 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uaddc\ubaa8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\uba70, \uccab\uc9f8, \uc804\uc5ed \uc800\ucc28\uc6d0 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc744 \uc704\ud574 topology-aware manifold \uadfc\uc0ac\uce58\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uace0, \ub458\uc9f8, \ucc28\ubcc4 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ub3d9\uc9c8\uc131\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc0d8\ud50c\uc758 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc801\uc778 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud1b5\ud569\ub41c \uc774\uc911 \uaddc\ubaa8\uc758 \ud1a0\ud3f4\ub85c\uc9c0 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub192\uc740 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uacfc \uc815\ubc00\ub3c4\ub97c \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uba70, \ud2b9\ud788 90%\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ub192\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b \uac00\uc9c0 \uce58\uae30 \ube44\uc728\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "TopoPrune\uc740 \uacac\uace0\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc6d0\uce59\uc801\uc778 \ud1a0\ud3f4\ub85c\uc9c0 \uae30\ubc18 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c \ub098\uc544\uac08 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uac00\uc9c0 \uce58\uae30 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd88\uc548\uc815\ud558\ub2e4. \uc678\ubd80 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc7a0\uc7ac \uacf5\uac04\uc758 \uad50\ub780\uc5d0 \ubbfc\uac10\ud558\uc5ec \uad50\ucc28 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \uc804\uc774 \ub610\ub294 \ud2b9\uc9d5 \ub178\uc774\uc988 \uc874\uc7ac \uc2dc \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc800\ud558\ub41c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ub0b4\uc7ac\uc801 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud1a0\ud3f4\ub85c\uc9c0\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 TopoPrune \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.

However, existing paradigms are often plagued by overfitting, training instability, ineffective binary rewards for multi-solution tasks, and the difficulty of synergizing techniques. We introduce STAR: Similarity-guided Teacher-Assisted Refinement, a novel holistic framework that effectively transfers LLMs' capabilities to super-tiny models. STAR consists of two core technical innovations: (1) Constrained Knowledge Distillation (CKD), a training objective that augments top-k forward KL divergence to suppress confidently incorrect predictions, ensuring training stability while preserving exploration capacity for downstream RL. STAR holistically synergizes these strategies within a cohesive training curriculum, enabling super-tiny models to achieve exceptional performance on complex function calling tasks; (2) Similarity-guided RL (Sim-RL), a RL mechanism that introduces a fine-grained, similarity-based reward. This provides a robust, continuous, and rich signal for better policy optimization by evaluating the similarity between generated outputs and the ground truth. Extensive experiments on challenging and renowned benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our STAR models establish SOTA in their size classes, significantly outperforming baselines. Remarkably, our 0.6B STAR model achieves the best performance among all open models under 1B, surpassing even several well-known open models at a larger scale.

A common recipe, SFT followed by GRPO, can stall when within-group reward variation is low (e.g., more rollouts in a group receive the all 0 or all 1 reward), making the group-normalized advantage uninformative and yielding vanishing updates. To address this problem, we propose RC-GRPO (Reward-Conditioned Group Relative Policy Optimization), which treats exploration as a controllable steering problem via discrete reward tokens. We first fine-tune a Reward-Conditioned Trajectory Policy (RCTP) on mixed-quality trajectories with reward goal special tokens (e.g., <|high_reward|>, <|low_reward|>) injected into the prompts, enabling the model to learn how to generate distinct quality trajectories on demand. Then during RL, we sample diverse reward tokens within each GRPO group and condition rollouts on the sampled token to improve within-group diversity, improving advantage gains.

We propose a novel method, which we call AgentOWL (Option and World model Learning Agent), that jointly learns -- in a sample efficient way -- an abstract world model (abstracting across both states and time) and a set of hierarchical neural options.

In this work, we mathematically show that this naive intuition is not always true: excessive pre-training can computationally slow down fine-tuning optimization. We study this phenomenon for low-rank adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning on single-index models trained under one-pass SGD. Leveraging a summary statistics description of the fine-tuning dynamics, we precisely characterize how the convergence rate depends on the initial fine-tuning alignment and the degree of non-linearity of the target task. The key take away is that even when the pre-training and down- stream tasks are well aligned, strong pre-training can induce a prolonged search phase and hinder convergence. Our theory thus provides a unified picture of how pre-training strength and task difficulty jointly shape the dynamics and limitations of LoRA fine-tuning in a nontrivial tractable model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ucd08\uae30 \uad50\uc721\uc774 \ub2e4\uc6b4\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9bc \ubb38\uc81c\uc758 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc18d\ub3c4\uac00 \ub290\ub824\uc9c8 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 LoRA \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc758 \ub3d9\uc801\uc131\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub2e8\uc77c \uc778\ub371\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud55c \ubc88\uc758 SGD\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ud55c \ud6c4 LoRA \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ucd08\uae30 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815 \uc815\ub82c\uacfc \ubaa9\ud45c \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \ube44\uc120\ud615\uc131 \uc815\ub3c4\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc218\ub834 \uc18d\ub3c4\uac00 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ub2ec\ub77c\uc9c0\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ud2b9\uc131\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc774\ub860\uc740 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815 \ub3d9\uc801\uc744 \ud615\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ucd08\uae30 \uad50\uc721 \uac15\ub3c4\uc640 \uc791\uc5c5 \ub09c\uc774\ub3c4\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \uadf8\ub9bc\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc18c\uc2a4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \ub2e4\uc6b4\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9bc \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uc6a9\uc774\ud558\uac8c \ud560 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \uae30\ub300\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc21c\uc9c4\ud55c \uc9c1\uad00\uc774 \ud56d\uc0c1 \uc0ac\uc2e4\uc774 \uc544\ub2d8\uc744 \uc218\ud559\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uacfc\ub3c4\ud55c \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\uc740 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uacc4\uc0b0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub290\ub9ac\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4e4 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud55c \ubc88\uc758 SGD \uc544\ub798 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ub2e8\uc77c \uc778\ub371\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ub0ae\uc740 \ub7ad\ud06c \uc801\uc751(LoRA) \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc774 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815 \ub3d9\uc801\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc694\uc57d \ud1b5\uacc4 \uc124\uba85\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \ucd08\uae30 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815 \uc815\ub82c\uacfc \ubaa9\ud45c \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \ube44\uc120\ud615\uc131 \uc815\ub3c4\uac00 \uc218\ub834 \uc18d\ub3c4\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \ud2b9\uc131\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc8fc\uc694 \uacb0\ub860\uc740 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\uacfc \ub2e4\uc6b4\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9bc \uc791\uc5c5\uc774 \uc798 \uc815\ub82c\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\ub354\ub77c\ub3c4, \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\uc774 \uae34 \uac80\uc0c9 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub97c \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\uace0 \uc218\ub834\uc744 \ubc29\ud574\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc774\ub860\uc740 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828 \uac15\ub3c4\uc640 \uc791\uc5c5 \ub09c\uc774\ub3c4\uac00 LoRA \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc758 \ub3d9\uc801 \ubc0f \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uacf5\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ud615\uc131\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569\ub41c \uadf8\ub9bc\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

While reinforcement learning has shown promise for adaptive signal control, existing methods struggle with multi-agent coordination and sample efficiency. We introduce MADT (Multi-Agent Decision Transformer), a novel approach that reformulates multi-agent traffic signal control as a sequence modeling problem. MADT extends the Decision Transformer paradigm to multi-agent settings by incorporating: (1) a graph attention mechanism for modeling spatial dependencies between intersections, (2) a|temporal transformer encoder for capturing traffic dynamics, and (3) return-to-go conditioning for target performance specification. Our approach enables offline learning from historical traffic data, with architecture design that facilitates potential online fine-tuning. Experiments on synthetic grid networks and real-world traffic scenarios demonstrate that MADT achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing average travel time by 5-6% compared to the strongest baseline while exhibiting superior coordination among adjacent intersections.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uad50\ucc28\ub85c\uc5d0\uc11c \uad50\ud1b5 \uc2e0\ud638 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub97c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 MADT\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub3c4\uc2dc \uad50\ud1b5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e0\ud638 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uad50\ucc28\ub85c \uac04\uc758 \uc870\uc815\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uba70, \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uc804\uccb4\uc758 \uad50\ud1b5 \ud750\ub984\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "MADT\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uad50\ud1b5 \uc2e0\ud638 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub97c \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uacf5\uac04 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc8fc\uc758 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uacfc \uad50\ud1b5 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc2dc\uac04 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30 \uc778\ucf54\ub354\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "MADT\ub294 \ud569\uc131 \uadf8\ub9ac\ub4dc \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ubc0f \uc2e4\uc81c \uad50\ud1b5 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\ud5d8\ud558\uc5ec \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uae30\uc900\uc120 \ub300\ube44 \ud3c9\uade0 \uc5ec\ud589 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 5-6% \uc904\uc774\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801 \uad50\ud1b5 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uba70, \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801\uc778 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uad50\ud1b5 \uc2e0\ud638 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub294 \ub3c4\uc2dc \uad50\ud1b5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c, \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uc804\uccb4\uc758 \uad50\ud1b5 \ud750\ub984\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uad50\ucc28\ub85c \uac04\uc758 \uc870\uc815\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc774 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc2e0\ud638 \uc81c\uc5b4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc73c\ub098, \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc870\uc815 \ubc0f \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uad50\ud1b5 \uc2e0\ud638 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub97c \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc778 MADT(\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uacb0\uc815 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30)\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Existing agent safety evaluations rely on risk-oriented tasks tailored to specific agent settings, resulting in limited coverage of safety risk space and failing to assess agent safety behavior during long-horizon, interactive task execution in complex real-world deployments. Moreover, their specialization to particular agent settings limits adaptability across diverse agent configurations. To address these limitations, we propose Risky-Bench, a framework that enables systematic agent safety evaluation grounded in real-world deployment. Risky-Bench organizes evaluation around domain-agnostic safety principles to derive context-aware safety rubrics that delineate safety space, and systematically evaluates safety risks across this space through realistic task execution under varying threat assumptions. When applied to life-assist agent settings, Risky-Bench uncovers substantial safety risks in state-of-the-art agents under realistic execution conditions. Moreover, as a well-structured evaluation pipeline, Risky-Bench is not confined to life-assist scenarios and can be adapted to other deployment settings to construct environment-specific safety evaluations, providing an extensible methodology for agent safety assessment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc2e4\uc138\uacc4 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Risky-Bench\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc548\uc804 \ud3c9\uac00\uac00 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucdb0\uc838 \uc788\uc5b4 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \uc548\uc804 \uc704\ud5d8 \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \ucee4\ubc84\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uace0, \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc2e4\uc81c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc218\ud589 \uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc548\uc804 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud568\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "Risky-Bench\ub294 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0 \uc5bd\ub9e4\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \uc548\uc804 \uc6d0\uce59\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uace0, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc704\ud611 \uac00\uc815\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc2e4\ud589\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc548\uc804 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc704\ud5d8\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc801\uc6a9\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \uc548\uc804 \uc704\ud5d8\uc774 \ubc1c\uacac\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Risky-Bench\ub294 \uc0dd\uba85 \ubcf4\uc870 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0 \ud55c\uc815\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba70, \ub2e4\ub978 \ubc30\ud3ec \uc124\uc815\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucdb0 \uc548\uc804 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc774 \ubc30\uce58\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc5b8\uc5b4\uc801 \ud53c\ud574\ub97c \ub118\ub294 \uc548\uc804 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc548\uc804 \ud3c9\uac00\ub294 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucdb0\uc9c4 \uc704\ud5d8 \uc9c0\ud5a5 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc548\uc804 \uc704\ud5d8 \uacf5\uac04\uc758 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801 \ud3c9\uac00\uac00 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc774\uba70, \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc2e4\uc81c \ubc30\ud3ec\uc5d0\uc11c \uc7a5\uae30 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc218\ud589 \uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc548\uc804 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub354\uc6b1\uc774, \ud2b9\uc815 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0 \ud2b9\ud654\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc5b4 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uad6c\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \uc801\uc751\uc131\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc2e4\uc138\uacc4 \ubc30\ud3ec\uc5d0 \uae30\ucd08\ud55c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc548\uc804 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Risky-Bench\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

One of the biggest challenges in developing health algorithms based on such biosignals is the sparsity of clinical labels, which makes biosignals temporally distant from lab draws less reliable for supervision. To address this problem, we introduce a simple training strategy that learns a biomarker-specific decay of sample weight over the time gap between a segment and its ground truth label and uses this weight in the loss with a regularizer to prevent trivial solutions. On smartwatch PPG from 450 participants across 10 biomarkers, the approach improves over baselines. In the subject-wise setting, the proposed approach averages 0.715 AUPRC, compared to 0.674 for a fine-tuned self-supervised baseline and 0.626 for a feature-based Random Forest. A comparison of four decay families shows that a simple linear decay function is most robust on average. Beyond accuracy, the learned decay rates summarize how quickly each biomarker's PPG evidence becomes stale, providing an interpretable view of temporal sensitivity.", "AI": {"tldr": "PPG\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uac74\uac15 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc6e8\uc5b4\ub7ec\ube14 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305\uacfc \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc73c\ub85c PPG\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uac74\uac15 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad00\uc2ec\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\ub098, \uc0dd\uccb4 \uc2e0\ud638 \uae30\ubc18 \uac74\uac15 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \uac1c\ubc1c \uc2dc \uc784\uc0c1 \ub77c\ubca8\uc758 \ud76c\uc18c\uc131\uc774 \uac00\uc7a5 \ud070 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc0d8\ud50c \uac00\uc911\uce58\uc758 \uc0dd\uccb4 \uc9c0\ud45c \ud2b9\uc815 \uac10\uc18c\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \uc190\uc2e4 \ud568\uc218\uc5d0 \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \ud56d\uacfc \ud568\uaed8 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud3c9\ubc94\ud55c \ud574\ub97c \ubc29\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \ud6c8\ub828 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "450\uba85\uc758 \ucc38\uac00\uc790\uc5d0\uc11c 10\uac1c\uc758 \uc0dd\uccb4 \uc9c0\ud45c\ub85c \uc218\uc9d1\ub41c \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8\uc6cc\uce58 PPG \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uac1c\uc120\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc8fc\uc81c\ubcc4 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c 0.715 AUPRC\ub97c \uae30\ub85d\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ub41c \uc790\uae30 \uac10\ub3c5 \ubca0\uc774\uc2a4\ub77c\uc778\uc778 0.674 \ubc0f \ud2b9\uc9d5 \uae30\ubc18 \ub79c\ub364 \ud3ec\ub808\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc758 0.626\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ub41c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \uac10\uc18c\uc728\uc740 \uac01 \uc0dd\uccb4 \uc9c0\ud45c\uc758 PPG \uadfc\uac70\uac00 \uc5bc\ub9c8\ub098 \ube60\ub974\uac8c \uc624\ub798\ub41c \uc0c1\ud0dc\uac00 \ub418\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc694\uc57d\ud558\uc5ec \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \ubbfc\uac10\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uad00\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6e8\uc5b4\ub7ec\ube14 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305\uacfc AI\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c0\ub09c 10\ub144 \ub3d9\uc548 \uac74\uac15 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c PPG \ud65c\uc6a9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad00\uc2ec\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud588\ub2e4. \uc0dd\uccb4 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uac74\uac15 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc5d0\uc11c \uac00\uc7a5 \ud070 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c \uc911 \ud558\ub098\ub294 \uc784\uc0c1 \ub77c\ubca8\uc758 \ud76c\uc18c\uc131\uc73c\ub85c, \uc774\ub294 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc2e4 \uc0d8\ud50c\uacfc \uc2dc\uac04\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uba3c \uc0dd\uccb4 \uc2e0\ud638\uc758 \uac10\ub3c5 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \uc800\ud558\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc138\uadf8\uba3c\ud2b8\uc640 \uc2e4\uc81c \ub77c\ubca8 \uac04\uc758 \uc2dc\uac04 \uac04\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc0d8\ud50c \uac00\uc911\uce58\uc758 \uc0dd\uccb4 \ub9c8\ucee4 \ud2b9\uc815 \uac10\uc18c\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uace0 \uc774 \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub97c \uc190\uc2e4 \ud568\uc218\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \ud56d\uacfc \ud568\uaed8 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud3c9\ubc94\ud55c \ud574\ub97c \ubc29\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \ud6c8\ub828 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4. 10\uac1c\uc758 \uc0dd\uccb4 \ub9c8\ucee4\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 450\uba85\uc758 \ucc38\uac00\uc790\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc5bb\uc740 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8\uc6cc\uce58 PPG\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uae30\ubcf8\uc120\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4. \uc8fc\uc81c\ubcc4 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 0.715 AUPRC\uc758 \ud3c9\uade0\uc744 \uae30\ub85d\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ub41c \uc790\uae30 \uac10\ub3c5 \ubca0\uc774\uc2a4\ub77c\uc778\uc758 0.674 \ubc0f \ud2b9\uc9d5 \uae30\ubc18 \ub79c\ub364 \ud3ec\ub808\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc758 0.626\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ub41c\ub2e4. \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \uac10\uc18c \ud328\ubc00\ub9ac\uc758 \ube44\uad50 \uacb0\uacfc, \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \uc120\ud615 \uac10\uc18c \ud568\uc218\uac00 \ud3c9\uade0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac00\uc7a5 \uac15\ub825\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ub118\uc5b4 \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \uac10\uc18c\uc728\uc740 \uac01 \uc0dd\uccb4 \ub9c8\ucee4\uc758 PPG \uadfc\uac70\uac00 \uc5bc\ub9c8\ub098 \ube68\ub9ac \uc9c4\ubd80\ud574\uc9c0\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc694\uc57d\ud558\uc5ec \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \ubbfc\uac10\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uad00\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

These frameworks impose distinct architectural structures that govern how agents interact, store information, and coordinate tasks. However, their impact on system performance remains poorly understood. This gap is critical, as architectural choices alone can induce order-of-magnitude differences in latency and throughput, as well as substantial variation in accuracy and scalability. Addressing this challenge requires (i) jointly evaluating multiple capabilities, such as orchestration overhead, memory behavior, planning, specialization, and coordination, and (ii) conducting these evaluations under controlled, framework-level conditions to isolate architectural effects. Existing benchmarks focus on individual capabilities and lack standardized framework-level evaluation. We address these limitations by (i) introducing an architectural taxonomy for systematically comparing multi-agent LLM frameworks along fundamental dimensions, and (ii) developing MAFBench, a unified evaluation suite that integrates existing benchmarks under a standardized execution pipeline. Using MAFBench, we conduct a controlled empirical study across several widely used frameworks. Our results show that framework-level design choices alone can increase latency by over 100x, reduce planning accuracy by up to 30%, and lower coordination success from above 90% to below 30%. Finally, we translate our findings into concrete architectural design principles and framework selection guidance, and outline promising future research directions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774

In [10], it was shown that, within a particular framework, every almost optimal and general agent necessarily contains sufficient knowledge of its environment to allow an approximate reconstruction of it by querying the agent as a black box. This result relied on the assumptions that the agent is deterministic and that the environment is fully observable.\n  In this work, we remove both assumptions by extending the theorem to stochastic agents operating in partially observable environments. Fundamentally, this shows that stochastic agents cannot avoid learning their environment through the usage of randomization. We also strengthen the result by weakening the notion of generality, proving that less powerful agents already contain a model of the world in which they operate.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ubd80\ubd84\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad00\uce21 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\ub3d9\ud560 \ub54c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uc0ac\uc2e4\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc8fc\ubcc0 \uc138\uacc4\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uacb0\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uadf8 \ub2a5\ub825\uacfc \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uc774\ud574\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub2e8\uacc4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc815\uc801 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \uc644\uc804 \uad00\ucc30 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uac00\uc815\uc744 \uc81c\uac70\ud558\uace0, \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ubd80\ubd84\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad00\uce21 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\ub9ac\ub97c \uc801\uc6a9\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud655\ub960\uc801 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ubb34\uc791\uc704\ud654\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc744 \uc218 \uc5c6\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uace0, \ub35c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub3c4 \uc790\uc2e0\uc774 \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\ub294 \uc138\uacc4\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ubcf4\uc720\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0, \ub354 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \ub35c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub3c4 \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc8fc\ubcc0 \uc138\uacc4\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ubcf4\uc720\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0 \uc5ec\ubd80\ub97c \uacb0\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uadf8 \ub2a5\ub825\uacfc \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uc774\ud574\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Its clinical outcome can be substantially improved through early detection and timely intervention. By leveraging publicly available datasets, machine learning (ML) has driven advances in both research and clinical practice. However, existing public datasets consider ICU patients (Intensive Care Unit) as a uniform group and neglect the potential challenges presented by critically ill trauma patients in whom injury-related inflammation and organ dysfunction can overlap with the clinical features of sepsis. We propose that a targeted identification of post-traumatic sepsis is necessary in order to develop methods for early detection. Therefore, we introduce a publicly available standardized post-trauma sepsis onset dataset extracted, relabeled using standardized post-trauma clinical facts, and validated from MIMIC-III. Furthermore, we frame early detection of post-trauma sepsis onset according to clinical workflow in ICUs in a daily basis resulting in a new rare event detection problem. We then establish a general benchmark through comprehensive experiments, which shows the necessity of further advancements using this new dataset.

Moreover, quantity-centric scaling exhibits an early bottleneck that underutilizes trajectory data. We propose TDScaling, a Trajectory Diversity Scaling-based data synthesis framework for code agents that scales performance through diversity rather than raw volume. Under a fixed training budget, increasing trajectory diversity yields larger gains than adding more trajectories, improving the performance-cost trade-off for agent training. TDScaling integrates four innovations: (1) a Business Cluster mechanism that captures real-service logical dependencies; (2) a blueprint-driven multi-agent paradigm that enforces trajectory coherence; (3) an adaptive evolution mechanism that steers synthesis toward long-tail scenarios using Domain Entropy, Reasoning Mode Entropy, and Cumulative Action Complexity to prevent mode collapse; and (4) a sandboxed code tool that mitigates catastrophic forgetting of intrinsic coding capabilities. Experiments on general tool-use benchmarks (BFCL, tau^2-Bench) and code agent tasks (RebenchT, CodeCI, BIRD) demonstrate a win-win outcome: TDScaling improves both tool-use generalization and inherent coding proficiency.

However, these ML predictors are often vulnerable to out-of-distribution (OOD) samples at test time, leading to significant decision performance degradation due to large prediction errors. To address the generalization challenges under OOD conditions, we present the framework of Distributionally Robust Decision-Focused Learning (DR-DFL), which trains ML models to optimize decision performance under the worst-case distribution. Instead of relying on classical Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) techniques, we propose Diffusion-Augmented Distributionally Robust Decision-Focused Learning (3D-Learning), which searches for the worst-case distribution within the parameterized space of a diffusion model. By leveraging the powerful distribution modeling capabilities of diffusion models, 3D-Learning identifies worst-case distributions that remain consistent with real data, achieving a favorable balance between average and worst-case scenarios.

However, even during benign task evolution, agent safety alignment remains vulnerable-a phenomenon known as Agent Memory Misevolution. To evaluate this phenomenon, we construct the Trust-Memevo benchmark to assess multi-dimensional trustworthiness during benign task evolution, revealing an overall decline in trustworthiness across various task domains and evaluation settings. To address this issue, we propose TAME, a dual-memory evolutionary framework that separately evolves executor memory to improve task performance by distilling generalizable methodologies, and evaluator memory to refine assessments of both safety and task utility based on historical feedback. Through a closed loop of memory filtering, draft generation, trustworthy refinement, execution, and dual-track memory updating, TAME preserves trustworthiness without sacrificing utility. Experiments demonstrate that TAME mitigates misevolution, achieving a joint improvement in both trustworthiness and task performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "TAME\ub294 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uacfc \uc791\uc5c5 \uc720\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ud544\ud130\ub9c1 \ubc0f \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba70 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \uc774\uc911 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc9c4\ud654 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AGI \ub2ec\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uac15\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\uc758 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc9c4\ud654\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc791\uc5c5 \uc9c4\ud654 \uc911 \uc548\uc804 \uc815\ub82c\uc774 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "TAME\ub294 \uc2e4\ud589\uae30 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\uc640 \ud3c9\uac00\uc790 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\ub97c \ubcc4\ub3c4\ub85c \uc9c4\ud654\uc2dc\ucf1c, \uc548\uc804\uc131\uacfc \uc791\uc5c5 \uc720\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \uc774\uc911 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc9c4\ud654 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "result": "TAME\ub294 misevolution\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\uba70 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uacfc \uc791\uc5c5 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ubaa8\ub450 \uac1c\uc120\ub418\ub294 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "TAME\ub294 \uc720\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \ud76c\uc0dd\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0\ub3c4 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\uc758 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc9c4\ud654\ub294 \uacbd\ud5d8 \ucd95\uc801\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud558\ub294 AGI \ub2ec\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc628\uac74\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5 \uc9c4\ud654 \uc911\uc5d0\ub3c4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc548\uc804 \uc815\ub82c\uc740 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ubbf8\uc5d0\ubcfc\ub8e8\uc158\uc774\ub77c\uace0 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc628\uac74\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5 \uc9c4\ud654 \ub3d9\uc548 \ub2e4\ucc28\uc6d0 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 Trust-Memevo \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5 \uc601\uc5ed \ubc0f \ud3c9\uac00 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc804\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc774 \uac10\uc18c\ud568\uc744 \ubc1d\ud600\ub0c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 TAME\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

We propose MA2B-DDQN, a human-centric multi-agent action-branching double Deep Q-Network (DQN) framework that explicitly optimizes traveler-level equity. Our key contribution is an action-branching discrete control formulation that decomposes corridor control into (i) local, per-intersection actions that allocate green time between the next two phases and (ii) a single global action that selects the total duration of those phases. This decomposition enables scalable coordination under discrete control while reducing the effective complexity of joint decision-making. We also design a human-centric reward that penalizes the number of delayed individuals in the corridor, accounting for pedestrians, vehicle occupants, and transit passengers. Extensive evaluations across seven realistic traffic scenarios in Melbourne, Australia, demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the number of impacted travelers, outperforming existing DRL and baseline methods. Experiments confirm the robustness of our model, showing minimal variance across diverse settings. This framework not only advocates for a fairer traffic signal system but also provides a scalable solution adaptable to varied urban traffic conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "MA2B-DDQN\uc740 \uc5ec\ud589\uc790 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uacf5\ud3c9\uc131\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc778\uac04 \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2ec\uce35 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uc218\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2ec\uce35 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \ucc28\ub7c9 \uc911\uc2ec\uc801\uc774\uba70 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \uc774\uc0b0 \ud589\ub3d9 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c.", "method": "MA2B-DDQN\uc740 \ud589\ub3d9 \ubd84\uae30 \uc774\uc0b0 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uacf5\uc2dd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uad00\uc81c \uc81c\uc5b4\ub97c \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9\uacfc \uc804\uc5ed \ud589\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub9e5\ub77d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 7\uac1c\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \uad50\ud1b5 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5ec\ud589\uc790 \uc218\ub97c \uc904\uc774\ub294 \ub370 \uc720\uc758\ubbf8\ud55c \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubcf8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uacf5\uc815\ud55c \uc2e0\ud638 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc9c0\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub3c4\uc2dc \uad50\ud1b5 \uc870\uac74\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ud1b5\ub85c\ub97c \ub530\ub77c \uad50\ud1b5 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ub9ce\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2ec\uce35 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(DRL) \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \ucc28\ub7c9 \uc911\uc2ec\uc801\uc774\uba70 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \uc774\uc0b0 \ud589\ub3d9 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5ec\ud589\uc790 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uacf5\ud3c9\uc131\uc744 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc778\uac04 \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud589\ub3d9 \ubd84\uae30 \uc774\uc911 \uc2ec\uce35 Q-\ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c(DQN) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 MA2B-DDQN\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec \uae30\uc5ec\ub294 \ud1b5\ub85c \uc81c\uc5b4\ub97c (i) \ub2e4\uc74c \ub450 \ub2e8\uacc4 \uac04\uc758 \ub179\uc0c9 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \ud560\ub2f9\ud558\ub294 \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc801\uc778 \uad50\ucc28\ub85c \ud589\ub3d9\uacfc (ii) \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub2e8\uacc4\uc758 \ucd1d \uc9c0\uc18d \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\ub294 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc804\uc5ed \ud589\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\ub294 \ud589\ub3d9 \ubd84\uae30 \uc774\uc0b0 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uacf5\uc2dd\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubd84\ud574\ub294 \uc774\uc0b0 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uba70 \uacf5\ub3d9 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \uc904\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \ubcf4\ud589\uc790, \ucc28\ub7c9 \ud0d1\uc2b9\uc790 \ubc0f \ub300\uc911 \uad50\ud1b5 \uc2b9\uac1d\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud558\uc5ec \ud1b5\ub85c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c0\uc5f0\ub41c \uac1c\uc778\uc758 \uc218\ub97c \ubc8c\uce59\ud558\ub294 \uc778\uac04 \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud638\uc8fc \uba5c\ubc84\ub978\uc758 7\uac1c \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \uad50\ud1b5 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3ed\ub113\uc740 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubc1b\uc740 \uc5ec\ud589\uc790 \uc218\ub97c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \uc904\uc774\uace0 \uae30\uc874\uc758 DRL \ubc0f \uae30\uc900 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc18c\ud55c\uc758 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uacf5\uc815\ud55c \uad50\ud1b5 \uc2e0\ud638 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc9c0\uc9c0\ud560 \ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub3c4\uc2dc \uad50\ud1b5 \uc870\uac74\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Yu", "Sen Su"], "title": "The Necessity of a Unified Framework for LLM-Based Agent Evaluation", "comment": null, "summary": "With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), general-purpose agents have seen fundamental advancements. However, evaluating these agents presents unique challenges that distinguish them from static QA benchmarks. We observe that current agent benchmarks are heavily confounded by extraneous factors, including system prompts, toolset configurations, and environmental dynamics. Existing evaluations often rely on fragmented, researcher-specific frameworks where the prompt engineering for reasoning and tool usage varies significantly, making it difficult to attribute performance gains to the model itself. Additionally, the lack of standardized environmental data leads to untraceable errors and non-reproducible results.

Ambiguous instructions may trigger harmful actions, and adversarial users can manipulate tool execution to achieve malicious goals. Existing benchmarks mostly focus on short-horizon or GUI-based tasks, evaluating on execution-time errors but overlooking the ability to anticipate planning-time risks. To fill this gap, we present LPS-Bench, a benchmark that evaluates the planning-time safety awareness of MCP-based CUAs under long-horizon tasks, covering both benign and adversarial interactions across 65 scenarios of 7 task domains and 9 risk types. We introduce a multi-agent automated pipeline for scalable data generation and adopt an LLM-as-a-judge evaluation protocol to assess safety awareness through the planning trajectory. Experiments reveal substantial deficiencies in existing CUAs' ability to maintain safe behavior.

Existing leading approaches, such as Lagrangian methods, typically rely on global penalties or centralized critics that react to violations after they occur, often suppressing exploration and leading to over-conservatism. We propose Co2PO, a novel MARL communication-augmented framework that enables coordination-driven safety through selective, risk-aware communication. Co2PO introduces a shared blackboard architecture for broadcasting positional intent and yield signals, governed by a learned hazard predictor that proactively forecasts potential violations over an extended temporal horizon. By integrating these forecasts into a constrained optimization objective, Co2PO allows agents to anticipate and navigate collective hazards without the performance trade-offs inherent in traditional reactive constraints. We evaluate Co2PO across a suite of complex multi-agent safety benchmarks, where it achieves higher returns compared to leading constrained baselines while converging to cost-compliant policies at deployment.

Current synthesis paradigms often face a recurring trade-off: maintaining structural validity typically restricts problem complexity, while relaxing constraints to increase difficulty frequently leads to inconsistent or unsolvable instances. To address this, we propose Agentic Proposing, a framework that models problem synthesis as a goal-driven sequential decision process where a specialized agent dynamically selects and composes modular reasoning skills. Through an iterative workflow of internal reflection and tool-use, we develop the Agentic-Proposer-4B using Multi-Granularity Policy Optimization (MGPO) to generate high-precision, verifiable training trajectories across mathematics, coding, and science. Empirical results demonstrate that downstream solvers trained on agent-synthesized data significantly outperform leading baselines and exhibit robust cross-domain generalization. Notably, a 30B solver trained on only 11,000 synthesized trajectories achieves a state-of-the-art 91.6% accuracy on AIME25, rivaling frontier-scale proprietary models such as GPT-5 and proving that a small volume of high-quality synthetic signals can effectively substitute for massive human-curated datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 Agentic

However, existing Lean datasets consist almost exclusively of correct proofs, offering little supervision for understanding and repairing failures. We study Lean proof repair as a supervised learning problem: given an erroneous proof and compiler feedback, predict both a corrected proof and a natural-language diagnosis grounded in the same feedback. We introduce APRIL (Automated Proof Repair in Lean), a dataset of 260,000 supervised tuples pairing systematically generated proof failures with compiler diagnostics and aligned repair and explanation targets. Training language models on APRIL substantially improves repair accuracy and feedback-conditioned reasoning; in our single-shot repair evaluation setting, a finetuned 4B-parameter model outperforms the strongest open-source baseline. We view diagnostic-conditioned supervision as a complementary training signal for feedback-using provers.

Existing meeting benchmarks mainly focus on simplified question answering and fail to reflect real world enterprise workflows, where queries arise organically from multi stakeholder collaboration, span long temporal contexts, and require tool augmented reasoning.\n  We address this gap through a grounded dataset and a learned agent framework. First, we introduce MeetAll, a bilingual and multimodal corpus derived from 231 enterprise meetings totaling 140 hours. Questions are injected using an enterprise informed protocol validated by domain expert review and human discriminability studies. Unlike purely synthetic benchmarks, this protocol is grounded in four enterprise critical dimensions: cognitive load, temporal context span, domain expertise, and actionable task execution, calibrated through interviews with stakeholders across finance, healthcare, and technology sectors.\n  Second, we propose MeetBench XL, a multi dimensional evaluation protocol aligned with human judgment that measures factual fidelity, intent alignment, response efficiency, structural clarity, and completeness. Third, we present MeetMaster XL, a learned dual policy agent that jointly optimizes query routing between fast and slow reasoning paths and tool invocation, including retrieval, cross meeting aggregation, and web search. A lightweight classifier enables accurate routing with minimal overhead, achieving a superior quality latency tradeoff over single model baselines. Experiments against commercial systems show consistent gains, supported by ablations, robustness tests, and a real world deployment case study.Resources: https://github.com/huyuelin/MeetBench.", "AI":

In practice, however, geometric descriptions can be under-specified or internally inconsistent: critical dimensions may be missing and constraints may conflict. Existing fine-tuned models tend to reactively follow user instructions and hallucinate dimensions when the text is ambiguous. To address this, we propose a proactive agentic framework for text-to-CadQuery generation, named ProCAD, that resolves specification issues before code synthesis. Our framework pairs a proactive clarifying agent, which audits the prompt and asks targeted clarification questions only when necessary to produce a self-consistent specification, with a CAD coding agent that translates the specification into an executable CadQuery program. We fine-tune the coding agent on a curated high-quality text-to-CadQuery dataset and train the clarifying agent via agentic SFT on clarification trajectories. Experiments show that proactive clarification significantly improves robustness to ambiguous prompts while keeping interaction overhead low. ProCAD outperforms frontier closed-source models, including Claude Sonnet 4.5, reducing the mean Chamfer distance by 79.9 percent and lowering the invalidity ratio from 4.8 percent to 0.9 percent.

On difficult problems, an LLM may fail to produce a correct final answer, yet still provide reliable pairwise comparison signals indicating which of two candidate solutions is better. We leverage this observation to design a statistically efficient evaluation framework that combines standard labeled outcomes with pairwise comparison signals obtained by having models judge auxiliary reasoning chains. Treating these comparison signals as control variates, we develop a semiparametric estimator based on the efficient influence function (EIF) for the setting where auxiliary reasoning chains are observed. This yields a one-step estimator that achieves the semiparametric efficiency bound, guarantees strict variance reduction over naive sample averaging, and admits asymptotic normality for principled uncertainty quantification. Across simulations, our one-step estimator substantially improves ranking accuracy, with gains increasing as model output noise grows.

Abstraction is essential for scaling agent memory, yet it often comes at the cost of specificity, obscuring the fine-grained details required for effective reasoning. We introduce Memora, a harmonic memory representation that structurally balances abstraction and specificity. Memora organizes information via its primary abstractions that index concrete memory values and consolidate related updates into unified memory entries, while cue anchors expand retrieval access across diverse aspects of the memory and connect related memories. Building on this structure, we employ a retrieval policy that actively exploits these memory connections to retrieve relevant information beyond direct semantic similarity. Theoretically, we show that standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Knowledge Graph (KG)-based memory systems emerge as special cases of our framework.

We introduce TextME, the first text-only modality expansion framework, to the best of our knowledge, projecting diverse modalities into LLM embedding space as a unified anchor. Our approach exploits the geometric structure of pretrained contrastive encoders to enable zero-shot cross-modal transfer using only text descriptions, without paired supervision. We empirically validate that such consistent modality gaps exist across image, video, audio, 3D, X-ray, and molecular domains, demonstrating that text-only training can preserve substantial performance of pretrained encoders. We further show that our framework enables emergent cross-modal retrieval between modality pairs not explicitly aligned during training (e.g., audio-to-image, 3D-to-image). These results establish text-only training as a practical alternative to paired supervision for modality expansion.", "AI": {"tldr": "TextME\ub294 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc124\uba85\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\ub97c LLM \uc784\ubca0\ub529 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7 \ud06c\ub85c\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uc804\uc774\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc804\uc6a9 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0 \ud655\uc7a5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc8fc\uc11d\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc30d \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ube44\ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc774\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\ub85c\uc758 \ud655\uc7a5\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "TextME\ub294 pretrained \ub300\ube44 \uc778\ucf54\ub354\uc758 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc124\uba85\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7 \ud06c\ub85c\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uc804\uc774\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0, \ube44\ub514\uc624, \uc624\ub514\uc624, 3D, X-ray \ubc0f \ubd84\uc790 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0 \uac04\uadf9\uc774 \uc874\uc7ac\ud568\uc744 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc804\uc6a9 \ud6c8\ub828\uc774 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0 \ud655\uc7a5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc30d \uac10\ub3c5\uc758 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \ub300\uc548\uc774 \ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ud655\ub9bd\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc30d \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b(\uc608: \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8-\uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0, \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8-\uc624\ub514\uc624, \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8-3D, \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8-\ubd84\uc790)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\ub85c\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ud45c\ud604 \ud655\uc7a5\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub418\ub294\ub370, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc740 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4e4\uace0 \uc758\ub8cc \uc774\ubbf8\uc9d5 \ubc0f \ubd84\uc790 \ubd84\uc11d\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc8fc\uc11d\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc885\uc885 \uc2e4\ud589 \ubd88\uac00\ub2a5\ud558\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\ub97c LLM \uc784\ubca0\ub529 \uacf5\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \ud22c\uc601\ud558\ub294 \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc804\uc6a9 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0 \ud655\uc7a5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 TextME\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ub300\ube44 \uc778\ucf54\ub354\uc758 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc30d \uac10\ub3c5 \uc5c6\uc774 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc124\uba85\ub9cc\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7 \ud06c\ub85c\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uc804\uc774\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0, \ube44\ub514\uc624, \uc624\ub514\uc624, 3D, X-ray \ubc0f \ubd84\uc790 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0 \uac04\uadf9\uc774 \uc874\uc7ac\ud568\uc744 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc804\uc6a9 \ud6c8\ub828\uc774 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc778\ucf54\ub354\uc758 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub610\ud55c \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc911 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\ub82c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0 \uc30d(\uc608: \uc624\ub514\uc624-\uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0, 3D-\uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0) \uac04\uc758 \uae34\uae09\ud55c \ud06c\ub85c\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uac80\uc0c9\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc804\uc6a9 \ud6c8\ub828\uc774 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0 \ud655\uc7a5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc30d \uac10\ub3c5\uc758 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \ub300\uc548\uc73c\ub85c \uc790\ub9ac \uc7a1\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ud655\ub9bd\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

However, existing preference-based conflict models rely exclusively on three qualitative relations, namely, preference, converse, and indifference, to describe agents' attitudes towards issue pairs, which significantly limits their capacity in capturing the essence of conflict. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the concept of an intuitionistic fuzzy preference-based conflict situation that captures agents' attitudes towards issue pairs with finer granularity than that afforded by classical preference-based models. Afterwards, we develop intuitionistic fuzzy preference-based conflict measures within this framework, and construct three-way conflict analysis models for trisecting the set of agent pairs, the agent set, and the issue set. Additionally, relative loss functions built on the proposed conflict functions are employed to calculate thresholds for three-way conflict analysis. Finally, we present adjustment mechanism-based feasible strategies that simultaneously account for both adjustment magnitudes and conflict degrees, together with an algorithm for constructing such feasible strategies, and provide an illustrative example to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc120\ud638 \uae30\ubc18 \uac08\ub4f1 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc9c1\uad00\uc801 \ud37c\uc9c0 \uc120\ud638 \uae30\ubc18 \uac08\ub4f1 \uc0c1\ud669\uc758 \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc120\ud638 \uae30\ubc18 \uac08\ub4f1 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uac08\ub4f1\uc758 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \ub370\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc9c1\uad00\uc801 \ud37c\uc9c0 \uc120\ud638 \uae30\ubc18 \uac08\ub4f1 \uce21\uc815\uce58\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uace0, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc30d, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc9d1\ud569, \uc774\uc288 \uc9d1\ud569\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0bc\uc6d0 \uac08\ub4f1 \ubd84\uc11d \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uac08\ub4f1 \ud568\uc218\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uc0c1\ub300 \uc190\uc2e4 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc0bc\uc6d0 \uac08\ub4f1 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc784\uacc4\uac12\uc744 \uacc4\uc0b0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc870\uc815 \ud06c\uae30\uc640 \uac08\ub4f1 \uc815\ub3c4\ub97c \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uace0\ub824\ud558\ub294 \uc870\uc815 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc0bc\uc6d0 \uac08\ub4f1 \ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0\uc11c \uc120\ud638 \uae30\ubc18 \uac08\ub4f1 \uc0c1\ud669\uc740 \uc774\uc288 \uc30d\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud0dc\ub3c4\ub97c \uc815\ud615\ud654\ub41c \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uc5ec \ud2b9\uc131\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc120\ud638 \uae30\ubc18 \uac08\ub4f1 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc774\uc288 \uc30d\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud0dc\ub3c4\ub97c \uc124\uba85\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc120\ud638, \uc5ed\uad00\uacc4 \ubc0f \ubb34\uad00\uc2ec\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc9c8\uc801 \uad00\uacc4\uc5d0\ub9cc \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \uac08\ub4f1\uc758 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \uc81c\ud55c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc120\ud638 \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354\uc6b1 \uc138\ubc00\ud558\uac8c \uc774\uc288 \uc30d\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud0dc\ub3c4\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \uc9c1\uad00\uc801 \ud37c\uc9c0 \uc120\ud638 \uae30\ubc18 \uac08\ub4f1 \uc0c1\ud669\uc758 \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ud6c4, \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c1\uad00\uc801 \ud37c\uc9c0 \uc120\ud638 \uae30\ubc18 \uac08\ub4f1 \uce21\uc815\uce58\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uace0, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc30d \uc9d1\ud569, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc9d1\ud569 \ubc0f \uc774\uc288 \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \uc0bc\ubd84\ud558\ub294 \uc0bc\uc6d0 \uac08\ub4f1 \ubd84\uc11d \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uac08\ub4f1 \ud568\uc218\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uc5ec \uad6c\ucd95\ub41c \uc0c1\ub300 \uc190\uc2e4 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc0bc\uc6d0 \uac08\ub4f1 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc784\uacc4\uac12\uc744 \uacc4\uc0b0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c, \uc870\uc815 \ud06c\uae30\uc640 \uac08\ub4f1 \uc815\ub3c4\ub97c \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uace0\ub824\ud558\ub294 \uc870\uc815 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc720\ud6a8\uc131\uacfc \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\ub294 \uc608\uc2dc\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

A central challenge in BDL lies in the design of informative prior distributions that scale effectively to high-dimensional data. Recent functional variational inference (VI) approaches address this issue by imposing priors directly in function space; however, most existing methods rely on Gaussian process (GP) priors, whose expressiveness and generalisation capabilities become limited in high-dimensional regimes. In this work, we propose VLM-FS-EB, a novel function-space empirical Bayes regularisation framework, leveraging large vision-language models (VLMs) to generates semantically meaningful context points. These synthetic samples are then used VLMs for embeddings to construct expressive functional priors. Furthermore, the proposed method is evaluated against various baselines, and experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently improves predictive performance and yields more reliable uncertainty estimates, particularly in out-of-distribution (OOD) detection tasks and data-scarce regimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc801\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uc815\ubcf4\uc801 \uc0ac\uc804 \ubd84\ud3ec \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \ub525 \ub7ec\ub2dd\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud568\uc218 \uacf5\uac04 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \ubca0\uc774\uc988 \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 VLM-FS-EB\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \ub525 \ub7ec\ub2dd(BDL)\uc740 \uae4a\uc740 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uacfc \ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub9de\ub294 \uc815\ubcf4\uc801 \uc0ac\uc804 \ubd84\ud3ec \uc124\uacc4\uac00 BDL\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \uacfc\uc81c \uc911 \ud558\ub098\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud070 \ube44\uc804-\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(VLM)\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc758\ubbf8 \uc788\ub294 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud568\uc218 \uacf5\uac04 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \ubca0\uc774\uc988 \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 VLM-FS-EB\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud569\uc131 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc740 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc744 \uc704\ud574 VLM\uc5d0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uc5b4 \ud45c\ud604\ub825\uc774 \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \ud568\uc218\uc801 \uc0ac\uc804\uc774 \uad6c\uc131\ub41c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud3c9\uac00\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc \uc6b0\ub9ac \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc608\uce21 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 OOD \uac10\uc9c0 \uc791\uc5c5 \ubc0f \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud55c \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c \ub354 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ucd94\uc815\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ud2b9\ud788 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \uc601\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc778 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uac00\uc6b0\uc2dc\uc548 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \ub525 \ub7ec\ub2dd (BDL)\uc740 \uae4a\uc740 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uacfc \ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.

Within The World Avatar (TWA), ontological specifications are compiled into executable tool interfaces that LLM-based agents must use to create and modify knowledge graph instances, enforcing semantic constraints during generation rather than through post-hoc validation. Extending TWA's semantic agent composition framework, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and associated agents are integral components of the knowledge graph ecosystem, enabling structured interaction between generative models, symbolic constraints, and external resources. An agent-based workflow translates ontologies into ontology-aware tools and iteratively applies them to extract, validate, and repair structured knowledge from unstructured scientific text. Using metal-organic polyhedra synthesis literature as an illustrative case, we show how executable ontological semantics can guide LLM behaviour and reduce manual schema and prompt engineering, establishing a general paradigm for embedding formal knowledge into generative systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uacfc \uacf5\uc2dd \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc6d0\ub9ac \uc99d\uba85 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc73c\ub85c\uc11c \uc628\ud1a8\ub85c\uc9c0-\ud234 \ucef4\ud30c\uc77c\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM\uacfc \uacf5\uc2dd \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc758 \uacb0\ud569 \ud544\uc694\uc131.", "method": "\uc628\ud1a8\ub85c\uc9c0 \uc0ac\uc591\uc744 \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud234 \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\ub85c \ucef4\ud30c\uc77c\ud558\uc5ec LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uc218\uc815\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud568.", "result": "\uc628\ud1a8\ub85c\uc9c0 \uc778\uc2dd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \ud234 \uc751\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \ube44\uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uacfc\ud559 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ucd94\ucd9c, \uac80\uc99d \ubc0f \uc218\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub97c \uad6c\ud604\ud568.", "conclusion": "\uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc628\ud1a8\ub85c\uc9c0 \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc774 LLM \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\uace0 \uc218\ub3d9 \uc2a4\ud0a4\ub9c8 \ubc0f \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\ub9c1\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uba70, \uc0dd\uc131 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \uacf5\uc2dd \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \ud655\ub9bd\ud568.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uacfc \uacf5\uc2dd \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uc6d0\ub9ac \uc99d\uba85 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc73c\ub85c\uc11c \uc628\ud1a8\ub85c\uc9c0-\ud234 \ucef4\ud30c\uc77c\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

In order to solve the problem, we propose a novel deep learning-based ensemble framework that leverages historical arrival patterns and real-time parcel status updates to forecast upcoming workloads at logistic hubs. This approach not only facilitates the generation of short-term forecasts, but also improves the accuracy of future hub workload predictions for more strategic planning and resource management. Empirical tests of the algorithm, conducted through a case study of a major city's parcel logistics, demonstrate the ensemble method's superiority over both traditional forecasting techniques and standalone deep learning models. Our findings highlight the significant potential of this method to improve operational efficiency in logistics hubs and advocate for its broader adoption.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd \uae30\ubc18 \uc559\uc0c1\ube14 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ubb3c\ub958 \ud5c8\ube0c\uc758 \uc5c5\ubb34\ub7c9 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0 \uc6b4\uc601 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc778\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uc1fc\ud551\uc758 \uae09\uc18d\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc801\uc2dc \ubc30\uc1a1\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc218\uc694\uac00 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ubb3c\ub958 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uc81c\uacf5\uc790\ub294 \ud5c8\ube0c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131, \ubbfc\ucca9\uc131 \ubc0f \uc608\uce21 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf1c\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801 \ub3c4\ucc29 \ud328\ud134\uacfc \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \uc18c\ud3ec \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd \uae30\ubc18 \uc559\uc0c1\ube14 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc8fc\uc694 \ub3c4\uc2dc\uc758 \uc18c\ud3ec \ubb3c\ub958 \uc0ac\ub840 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \uc2e4\uc99d \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc559\uc0c1\ube14 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc608\uce21 \uae30\uc220 \ubc0f \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud568\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ubb3c\ub958 \ud5c8\ube0c\uc758 \uc6b4\uc601 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uace0, \ub354 \ub113\uc740 \ucc44\ud0dd\uc744 \uad8c\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uc1fc\ud551\uc758 \uae09\uc18d\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5\uc740 \uc801\uc2dc \uc18c\ud3ec \ubc30\uc1a1\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc218\uc694\ub97c \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ucf30\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ubb3c\ub958 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uc81c\uacf5\uc790\uc5d0\uac8c \ud5c8\ube0c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131, \ubbfc\ucca9\uc131 \ubc0f \uc608\uce21 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uac83\uc744 \uac15\uc694\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801 \ub3c4\ucc29 \ud328\ud134\uacfc \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \uc18c\ud3ec \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubb3c\ub958 \ud5c8\ube0c\uc758 \ud5a5\ud6c4 \uc791\uc5c5\ub7c9\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd \uae30\ubc18 \uc559\uc0c1\ube14 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ub2e8\uae30 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \ubfd0 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \ub354 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801\uc778 \uacc4\ud68d \ubc0f \uc790\uc6d0 \uad00\ub9ac\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ubbf8\ub798 \ud5c8\ube0c \uc791\uc5c5\ub7c9 \uc608\uce21\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4. \uc8fc\uc694 \ub3c4\uc2dc\uc758 \uc18c\ud3ec \ubb3c\ub958\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0ac\ub840 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc218\ud589\ub41c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \uc2e4\uc99d \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub294 \uc559\uc0c1\ube14 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc608\uce21 \uae30\uc220 \ubc0f \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc6b0\uc218\ud568\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ubb3c\ub958 \ud5c8\ube0c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b4\uc601 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uace0, \uadf8 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \ucc44\ud0dd\uc744 \uc639\ud638\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

Thus, Continual Reinforcement Learning (CRL) is a promising pathway for deploying VLA models in lifelong robotic scenarios, yet balancing stability (retaining old skills) and plasticity (learning new ones) remains a formidable challenge for existing methods. We introduce CRL-VLA, a framework for continual post-training of VLA models with rigorous theoretical bounds. We derive a unified performance bound linking the stability-plasticity trade-off to goal-conditioned advantage magnitude, scaled by policy divergence. CRL-VLA resolves this dilemma via asymmetric regulation: constraining advantage magnitudes on prior tasks while enabling controlled growth on new tasks. This is realized through a simple but effective dual-critic architecture with novel Goal-Conditioned Value Formulation (GCVF), where a frozen critic anchors semantic consistency and a trainable estimator drives adaptation. Experiments on the LIBERO benchmark demonstrate that CRL-VLA effectively harmonizes these conflicting objectives, outperforming baselines in both anti-forgetting and forward adaptation.", "AI": {"tldr": "CRL-VLA\ub294 VLA \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801 \ud6c4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc548\uc815\uc131\uacfc \uc720\uc5f0\uc131\uc744 \uc870\ud654\ub86d\uac8c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba70 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uc774\ub8e9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \uac1c\ubc29\ud615 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uccb4\ud654\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0\uac8c \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\uba70, VLA \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud658\uacbd\uacfc \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2a5\uc219\ud55c \uc870\uc791\uc744 \ubc30\uc6b0\ub3c4\ub85d \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "CRL-VLA\ub294 VLA \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801 \ud6c4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uacbd\uacc4\uac00 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc548\uc815\uc131\uacfc \uc720\uc5f0\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ub4dc\uc624\ud504\ub97c \ubaa9\ud45c \uae30\ubc18 \uc774\uc810 \ud06c\uae30\uc5d0 \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569 \uc131\ub2a5 \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "CRL-VLA\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \uc774\uc810 \ud06c\uae30\ub97c \uc81c\uc57d\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud1b5\uc81c\ub41c \uc131\uc7a5\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \uc548\uc815\uc131\uacfc \uc720\uc5f0\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \ub51c\ub808\ub9c8\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "LIBERO \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 CRL-VLA\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc0c1\ucda9\ub418\ub294 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\ud654\uc2dc\ucf1c, \uc78a\uc5b4\ubc84\ub9bc \ubc29\uc9c0\uc640 \uc804\ubc29 \uc801\uc751 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\ub294 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \uac70\ub450\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc0dd\uc560 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \uac1c\ubc29\ud615 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uccb4\ud654\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0\uac8c \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\uba70, \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc740 VLA \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud658\uacbd\uacfc\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2a5\uc219\ud55c \uc870\uc791\uc744 \uc775\ud788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc73c\ub85c \ubd80\uc0c1\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(CRL)\uc740 \uc0dd\uc560 \ub85c\ubd07 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c VLA \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ubc30\ud3ec\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uacbd\ub85c\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc548\uc815\uc131(\uc624\ub798\ub41c \uae30\uc220 \uc720\uc9c0)\uacfc \uac00\ubcc0\uc131(\uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uae30\uc220 \ud559\uc2b5) \uac04\uc758 \uade0\ud615 \uc720\uc9c0\uac00 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub85c \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 VLA \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801 \ud6c4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c CRL-VLA\ub77c\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc548\uc815\uc131-\uac00\ubcc0\uc131 \ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ub4dc\uc624\ud504\ub97c \uc815\ucc45 \ubc1c\uc0b0\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc870\uc815\ub41c \ubaa9\ud45c \uc870\uac74 \uc774\uc810 \ud06c\uae30\uc640 \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569 \uc131\ub2a5 \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud55c\ub2e4.

Leveraging this, we introduce SATORIS-N, a framework for imputing partially observed traffic-density by informed subspace priors from neighboring days. Our contribution is a subspace-aware semidefinite programming (SDP)} formulation of nuclear norm that explicitly informs the reconstruction with prior singular-subspace information. This convex formulation jointly enforces low rank and subspace alignment, providing a single global optimum and substantially improving accuracy under medium and high occlusion. We also study a lightweight implicit subspace-alignment} strategy in which matrices from consecutive days are concatenated to encourage alignment of spatial or temporal singular directions. Although this heuristic offers modest gains when missing rates are low, the explicit SDP approach is markedly more robust when large fractions of entries are missing. Across two real-world datasets (Beijing and Shanghai), SATORIS-N consistently outperforms standard matrix-completion methods such as SoftImpute, IterativeSVD, statistical, and even deep learning baselines at high occlusion levels. The framework generalizes to other spatiotemporal settings in which singular subspaces evolve slowly over time. In the context of intelligent vehicles and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) systems, accurate traffic-density\n  reconstruction enables critical applications including cooperative perception, predictive routing, and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication optimization.

However, unlike real-time conversational assistants, DR is computationally expensive and time-consuming, creating an autonomy-interaction dilemma: high autonomy on ambiguous user queries often leads to prolonged execution with unsatisfactory outcomes. To address this, we propose IntentRL, a framework that trains proactive agents to clarify latent user intents before starting long-horizon research. To overcome the scarcity of open-ended research data, we introduce a scalable pipeline that expands a few seed samples into high-quality dialogue turns via a shallow-to-deep intent refinement graph. We further adopt a two-stage reinforcement learning (RL) strategy: Stage I applies RL on offline dialogues to efficiently learn general user-interaction behavior, while Stage II uses the trained agent and a user simulator for online rollouts to strengthen adaptation to diverse user feedback. Extensive experiments show that IntentRL significantly improves both intent hit rate and downstream task performance, outperforming the built-in clarify modules of closed-source DR agents and

In each round, an agent chooses among $K$ candidate links/servers (arms) whose performance is a stochastic $d$-dimensional vector (e.g., throughput, latency, energy, reliability). The key interaction is \\emph{probe-then-commit (PtC)}: the agent may probe up to $q>1$ candidates via control-plane measurements to observe their vector outcomes, but must execute exactly one candidate in the data plane. This limited multi-arm feedback regime strictly interpolates between classical bandits ($q=1$) and full-information experts ($q=K$), yet existing multi-objective learning theory largely focuses on these extremes. We develop \\textsc{PtC-P-UCB}, an optimistic probe-then-commit algorithm whose technical core is frontier-aware probing under uncertainty in a Pareto mode, e.g., it selects the $q$ probes by approximately maximizing a hypervolume-inspired frontier-coverage potential and commits by marginal hypervolume gain to directly expand the attained Pareto region. We prove a dominated-hypervolume frontier error of $\\tilde{O} (K_P d/\\sqrt{qT})$, where $K_P$ is the Pareto-frontier size and $T$ is the horizon, and scalarized regret $\\tilde{O} (L_\u03c6d\\sqrt{(K/q)T})$, where $\u03c6$ is the scalarizer.

This reduction in variance has already led to problems in model performance, including model collapse and hallucination. In this paper, we examine the long-term consequences of AI use for human cultural evolution and the conditions under which widespread AI use may lead to \"cultural collapse\", a process in which reliance on AI-generated content reduces human variation and innovation and slows cumulative cultural evolution. Using an agent-based model and evolutionary game theory, we compare two types of AI use: complement and substitute. AI-complement users seek suggestions and guidance while remaining the main producers of the final output, whereas AI-substitute users provide minimal input, and rely on AI to produce most of the output. We then study how these use strategies compete and spread under evolutionary dynamics. We find that AI-substitute users prevail under individual-level selection despite the stronger reduction in cultural variance. By contrast, AI-complement users can benefit their groups by maintaining the variance needed for exploration, and can therefore be favored under cultural group selection when group boundaries are strong. Overall, our findings shed light on the long-term, population-level effects of AI adoption and inform policy and organizational strategies to mitigate these risks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc0dd\uc131\uc801 AI\uc758 \uc758\uc874\ub3c4\uac00 \ubb38\ud654\uc801 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uacfc \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \uc904\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc131\ub2a5 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.

We introduce a hierarchical self-supervised learning (SSL) framework that jointly learns node-, edge-, and graph-level embeddings, inspired by multimodal neuroimaging. We construct a controllable synthetic benchmark mimicking the topological properties of connectomes. Our four-stage evaluation protocol reveals a critical failure: the invariance-based SSL model is fundamentally misaligned with the benchmark's topological properties and is catastrophically outperformed by classical, topology-aware heuristics. Ablations confirm an objective mismatch: SSL objectives designed to be invariant to topological perturbations learn to ignore the very community structure that classical methods exploit. Our results expose a fundamental pitfall in applying generic graph SSL to connectome-like data. We present this framework as a cautionary case study, highlighting the need for new, topology-aware SSL objectives for neuro-AI research that explicitly reward the preservation of structure (e.g., modularity or motifs).", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc9c0\uc5ed \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc774 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc804\uc5ed\uc801\uc778 \ub1cc \uc870\uc9c1\uc744 \ud615\uc131\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc774\ud574\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0bc \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc2e0\uacbd \uae30\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc9c0\uc5ed \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc774 \uc804\uc5ed \ub1cc \uc870\uc9c1\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc790\uae30 \uc9c0\ub3c4 \ud559\uc2b5(SSL) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \ub178\ub4dc, \uc5e3\uc9c0 \ubc0f \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc744 \uacf5\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud3c9\uac00 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 SSL \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uae30\uc900\uc758 \uc704\uc0c1\uc801 \ud2b9\uc131\uacfc \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubbf8\uc2a4 \uc54c\ub77c\uc778 \ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uace0\uc804\uc801\uc778 \uc704\uc0c1 \uc778\uc2dd \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uadf9\ub2e8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc800\ud558\ub41c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4, \uc704\uc0c1 \uc778\uc2dd SSL \ubaa9\ud45c\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud568\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70, \uc2e0\uacbd AI \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c \uad6c\uc870 \ubcf4\uc874\uc744 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\uc0c1\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc9c0\uc5ed \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc774 \uc804\uc5ed \ub1cc \uc870\uc9c1\uc744 \ud615\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0bc \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \uc2e0\uacbd \uc601\uc0c1\uc5d0\uc11c \uc601\uac10\uc744 \uc5bb\uc5b4 \ub178\ub4dc, \uc5e3\uc9c0 \ubc0f \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc744 \uacf5\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc790\uae30 \uc9c0\ub3c4 \ud559\uc2b5(SSL) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ucee4\ub125\ud1b0\uc758 \uc704\uc0c1\uc801 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \ubaa8\ubc29\ud55c \uc81c\uc5b4 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud569\uc131 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uad6c\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub124 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc740 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc2e4\ud328\ub97c \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4: \ubd88\ubcc0\uc131 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 SSL \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uae30\uc900\uc758 \uc704\uc0c1\uc801 \ud2b9\uc131\uacfc \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ud558\uba70, \uace0\uc804\uc801\uc778 \uc704\uc0c1 \uc778\uc2dd \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc7ac\uc559\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc800\ud558\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc808\ub2e8 \uc2dc\ud5d8\uc740 \ubaa9\uc801\uc758 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub97c \ud655\uc778\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uc704\uc0c1\uc801 \uad50\ub780\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ubd88\ubcc0\uc73c\ub85c \uc124\uacc4\ub41c SSL \ubaa9\uc801\uc740 \uace0\uc804\uc801 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ud2f0 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ubb34\uc2dc\ud558\ub294 \ubc95\uc744 \ubc30\uc6c1\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 SSL\uc744 \ucee4\ub125\ud1b0\uacfc \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\uc5b4 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ub2e8\uc810\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc8fc\uc758 \uc0ac\ub840 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub85c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uc5ec, \uad6c\uc870 \ubcf4\uc874(\uc608: \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc131 \ub610\ub294 \ubaa8\ud2f0\ud504)\uc744 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\uc0c1\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc704\uc0c1 \uc778\uc2dd SSL \ubaa9\ud45c\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Recent work in Generative Agent-Based Modeling has shown that large language models can simulate human-like synthetic personas with high fidelity, accurately reproducing the beliefs and behaviors of specific individuals. However, most approaches require detailed data about target populations and often prioritize density matching (replicating what is most probable) rather than support coverage (spanning what is possible), leaving long-tail behaviors underexplored. We introduce Persona Generators, functions that can produce diverse synthetic populations tailored to arbitrary contexts. We apply an iterative improvement loop based on AlphaEvolve, using large language models as mutation operators to refine our Persona Generator code over hundreds of iterations. The optimization process produces lightweight Persona Generators that can automatically expand small descriptions into populations of diverse synthetic personas that maximize coverage of opinions and preferences along relevant diversity axes.

To address this, we propose a novel detection framework based on Toxicity Association Graphs (TAGs), which systematically model semantic associations between innocuous entities and latent toxic implications. Leveraging TAGs, we introduce the first quantifiable metric for hidden toxicity, the Multimodal Toxicity Covertness (MTC), which measures the degree of concealment in toxic multimodal expressions. By integrating our detection framework with the MTC metric, our approach enables precise identification of covert toxicity while preserving full interpretability of the decision-making process, significantly enhancing transparency in multimodal toxicity detection. To validate our method, we construct the Covert Toxic Dataset, the first benchmark specifically designed to capture high-covertness toxic multimodal instances. This dataset encodes nuanced cross-modal associations and serves as a rigorous testbed for evaluating both the proposed metric and detection framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods across both low- and high-covertness toxicity regimes, while delivering clear, interpretable, and auditable detection outcomes. Together, our contributions advance the state of the art in explainable multimodal toxicity detection and lay the foundation for future context-aware and interpretable approaches.

Exploring the Limits of Complex Reasoning with GTOC 12", "comment": "Extended version of the paper presented at AIAA SciTech 2026 Forum. Includes futher experiments, corrections and new appendix", "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in code generation and general reasoning, yet their capacity for autonomous multi-stage planning in high-dimensional, physically constrained environments remains an open research question. This study investigates the limits of current AI agents by evaluating them against the 12th Global Trajectory Optimization Competition (GTOC 12), a complex astrodynamics challenge requiring the design of a large-scale asteroid mining campaign. We adapt the MLE-Bench framework to the domain of orbital mechanics and deploy an AIDE-based agent architecture to autonomously generate and refine mission solutions. To assess performance beyond binary validity, we employ an \"LLM-as-a-Judge\" methodology, utilizing a rubric developed by domain experts to evaluate strategic viability across five structural categories. A comparative analysis of models, ranging from GPT-4-Turbo to reasoning-enhanced architectures like Gemini 2.5 Pro, and o3, reveals a significant trend: the average strategic viability score has nearly doubled in the last two years (rising from 9.3 to 17.2 out of 26). However, we identify a critical capability gap between strategy and execution. While advanced models demonstrate sophisticated conceptual understanding, correctly framing objective functions and mission architectures, they consistently fail at implementation due to physical unit inconsistencies, boundary condition errors, and inefficient debugging loops.

However, training these agents via reinforcement learning is hindered by the multi-scale credit assignment problem: existing methods typically rely on sparse, trajectory-level rewards that fail to distinguish between high-quality reasoning and fortuitous guesses, leading to redundant or misleading search behaviors. To address this, we propose Search-R2, a novel Actor-Refiner collaboration framework that enhances reasoning through targeted intervention, with both components jointly optimized during training. Our approach decomposes the generation process into an Actor, which produces initial reasoning trajectories, and a Meta-Refiner, which selectively diagnoses and repairs flawed steps via a 'cut-and-regenerate' mechanism. To provide fine-grained supervision, we introduce a hybrid reward design that couples outcome correctness with a dense process reward quantifying the information density of retrieved evidence. Theoretically, we formalize the Actor-Refiner interaction as a smoothed mixture policy, proving that selective correction yields strict performance gains over strong baselines. Extensive experiments across various general and multi-hop QA datasets demonstrate that Search-R2 consistently outperforms strong RAG and RL-based baselines across model scales, achieving superior reasoning accuracy with minimal overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "Search-R2\ub294 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574

However, clinical RL is fundamentally bottlenecked by reward engineering: the challenge of defining signals that safely and effectively guide policy learning in complex, sparse offline environments. Existing approaches often rely on manual heuristics that fail to generalize across diverse pathologies. To address this, we propose an automated pipeline leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for offline reward design and verification. We formulate the reward function using potential functions consisted of three core components: survival, confidence, and competence. We further introduce quantitative metrics to rigorously evaluate and select the optimal reward structure prior to deployment. By integrating LLM-driven domain knowledge, our framework automates the design of reward functions for specific diseases while significantly enhancing the performance of the resulting policies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub3d9\uc801 \uce58\ub8cc \uccb4\uacc4 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc124\uacc4 \ubc0f \uac80\uc99d \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc784\uc0c1 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ucc45 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc548\ub0b4\ud558\ub294 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \uc2e0\ud638 \uc815\uc758\uc758 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc778 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uacf5\ud559\uc758 \uc57d\uc810\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc0dd\uc874, \uc2e0\ub8b0 \ubc0f \ub2a5\ub825\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud575\uc2ec \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub85c \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc9c4 \uc7a0\uc7ac \ud568\uc218\ub85c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uace0, \ubc30\ud3ec \uc804\uc5d0 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc815\ub7c9\uc801 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "LLM \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368, \ud2b9\uc815 \uc9c8\ubcd1\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218 \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uacb0\uacfc \uc815\ucc45\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubcd1\ub9ac\ud559\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub418\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc218\ub3d9 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc124\uacc4\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uace0, \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218\uc758 \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc740 \ub3d9\uc801 \uce58\ub8cc \uccb4\uacc4(DTR)\ub97c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc784\uc0c1 RL\uc740 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uacf5\ud559\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac78\ub9bc\ub3cc\uc774 \ub41c\ub2e4. \uc989, \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud558\uace0 \ud76c\ubc15\ud55c \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ucc45 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc548\uc804\ud558\uace0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc548\ub0b4\ud558\ub294 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc815\uc758\ud558\ub294 \ub3c4\uc804\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubcd1\ub9ac\ud559\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub418\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \uc218\ub3d9 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc124\uacc4 \ubc0f \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc0dd\uc874, \uc2e0\ub8b0 \ubc0f \ub2a5\ub825\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud575\uc2ec \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub85c \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc9c4 \uc7a0\uc7ac \ud568\uc218\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uace0, \ubc30\ud3ec \uc804\uc5d0 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc815\ub7c9\uc801 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4.

Through attention analysis, we identify conversational inertia, a phenomenon where models exhibit strong diagonal attention to previous responses, which is associated with imitation bias that constrains exploration. This reveals a tension when transforming few-shot LLMs into agents: longer context enriches environmental feedback for exploitation, yet also amplifies conversational inertia that undermines exploration. Our key insight is that for identical states, actions generated with longer contexts exhibit stronger inertia than those with shorter contexts, enabling construction of preference pairs without environment rewards. Based on this, we propose Context Preference Learning to calibrate model preferences to favor low-inertia responses over highinertia ones. We further provide context management strategies at inference time to balance exploration and exploitation.

Byzantine failures. To solve this issue, robust distributed learning algorithms have been developed, which typically replace parameter averaging by robust aggregations. While generic conditions on these aggregations exist to guarantee the convergence of (Stochastic) Gradient Descent (SGD), the analyses remain rather ad-hoc. This hinders the development of more complex robust algorithms, such as accelerated ones. In this work, we show that Byzantine-robust distributed optimization can, under standard generic assumptions, be cast as a general optimization with inexact gradient oracles (with both additive and multiplicative error terms), an active field of research.\n  This allows for instance to directly show that GD on top of standard robust aggregation procedures obtains optimal asymptotic error in the Byzantine setting. Going further, we propose two optimization schemes to speed up the convergence. The first one is a Nesterov-type accelerated scheme whose proof directly derives from accelerated inexact gradient results applied to our formulation. The second one hinges on Optimization under Similarity, in which the server leverages an auxiliary loss function that approximates the global loss. Both approaches allow to drastically reduce the communication complexity compared to previous methods, as we show theoretically and empirically.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud45c\uc900 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc774 \ube44\uc794\ud2f4 \ub178\ub4dc\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud568\uc744 \uc9c0\uc801\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uac15\uac74\ud55c \ubd84\uc0b0 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \ud3c9\uade0\ud654\ub97c \uac15\uac74\ud55c \uc9d1\uacc4\ub85c \ub300\uccb4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ube44\uc794\ud2f4 \uac15\uac74 \ubd84\uc0b0 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uac00 \uc77c\ubc18 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uc218\ub834 \uc18d\ub3c4\ub97c \ub192\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc2a4\ud0b4\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc774 \ube44\uc794\ud2f4 \uc2e4\ud328\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\ube44\uc794\ud2f4 \uac15\uac74 \ubd84\uc0b0 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc77c\ubc18 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\uace0, \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc2a4\ud0b4\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uac15\uac74\ud55c \uc9d1\uacc4 \uc808\ucc28\ub97c \uc801\uc6a9\ud55c \uacbd\ub7c9 \uacbd\ub7c9\ud654\uac00 \ube44\uc794\ud2f4 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uc810\uadfc\uc801 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \uc5bb\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubc0f \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc774\uc804 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uc904\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud45c\uc900 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \uc801\ub300\uc801\uc778 \ub178\ub4dc, \uc989 \ube44\uc794\ud2f4 \uc2e4\ud328\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uac15\uac74\ud55c \ubd84\uc0b0 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc774 \uac1c\ubc1c\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \ud3c9\uade0\ud654\ub97c \uac15\uac74\ud55c \uc9d1\uacc4\ub85c \ub300\uccb4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc9d1\uacc4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uc870\uac74\uc774 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\uc5ec (\ud655\ub960\uc801) \uacbd\ub7c9 \uacbd\ub7c9\ud654(SGD)\uc758 \uc218\ub834\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubd84\uc11d\uc740 \ub2e4\uc18c \uc784\uc758\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ub41c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ub354\uc6b1 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uac15\uac74\ud55c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc774 \uc800\ud574\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ube44\uc794\ud2f4 \uac15\uac74 \ubd84\uc0b0 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uac00 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uac00\uc815 \ud558\uc5d0 \ubd88\uc644\uc804\ud55c \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \uc624\ub77c\ud074\uc744 \uac16\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \ud45c\ud604\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc608\ub97c \ub4e4\uc5b4 \ud45c\uc900 \uac15\uac74 \uc9d1\uacc4 \uc808\ucc28 \uc704\uc5d0 GD\ub97c \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ube44\uc794\ud2f4 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uc810\uadfc\uc801 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \uc5bb\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc9c1\uc811 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub354 \ub098\uc544\uac00, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc218\ub834 \uc18d\ub3c4\ub97c \ub192\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc2a4\ud0b4\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8\ub294 \uc6b0\ub9ac \ud45c\ud604\uc2dd\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ub41c \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ub41c \ubd88\uc644\uc804 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \uacb0\uacfc\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ub41c \ub124\uc2a4\ud14c\ub85c\ud504 \uc720\ud615\uc758 \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ub41c \uc2a4\ud0b4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub450 \ubc88\uc9f8\ub294 \uc11c\ubc84\uac00 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uc190\uc2e4\uc744 \uadfc\uc0ac\ud558\ub294 \ubcf4\uc870 \uc190\uc2e4 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131 \ud558\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub450 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd \ubaa8\ub450 \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubc0f \uc2e4\uc99d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcfc \ub54c \uc774\uc804 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uc904\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

This insight enables a direct test for potential causal relationships by checking the variance of their corresponding effect-cause conditional distributions across multiple downsampled subsets of the data. These subsets are selected to reflect different prior cause distributions, while preserving the effect-cause conditional relationships. Using this invariance test and exploiting an (empirical) sparsity of most causal graphs, we develop an algorithm that efficiently uncovers causal relationships with quadratic complexity in the number of observational variables, reducing the processing time by up to 25x compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Realizing this promise for increasingly complex, long-horizon tasks has driven the rise of a sub-agent-as-tools paradigm for multi-turn task solving. However, existing designs still lack a dynamic abstraction view of sub-agents, thereby hurting adaptability. We address this challenge with a unified, framework-agnostic agent abstraction that models any agent as a tuple Instruction, Context, Tools, Model. This tuple acts as a compositional recipe for capabilities, enabling the system to spawn specialized executors for each task on demand. Building on this abstraction, we introduce an agentic system AOrchestra, where the central orchestrator concretizes the tuple at each step: it curates task-relevant context, selects tools and models, and delegates execution via on-the-fly automatic agent creation. Such designs enable reducing human engineering efforts, and remain framework-agnostic with plug-and-play support for diverse agents as task executors. It also enables a controllable performance-cost trade-off, allowing the system to approach Pareto-efficient. Across three challenging benchmarks (GAIA, SWE-Bench, Terminal-Bench), AOrchestra achieves 16.28% relative improvement against the strongest baseline when paired with Gemini-3-Flash.

However, the phenomenon of benign relearning, in which forgotten information reemerges even from benign fine-tuning data, reveals that existing unlearning methods remain fundamentally fragile. A common explanation attributes this effect to topical relevance, but we find this account insufficient. Through systematic analysis, we demonstrate that syntactic similarity, rather than topicality, is the primary driver: across benchmarks, syntactically similar data consistently trigger recovery even without topical overlap, due to their alignment in representations and gradients with the forgotten content. Motivated by this insight, we introduce syntactic diversification, which paraphrases the original forget queries into heterogeneous structures prior to unlearning. This approach effectively suppresses benign relearning, accelerates forgetting, and substantially alleviates the trade-off between unlearning efficacy and model utility.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud2b9\uc815 \ub0b4\uc6a9\uc744 \uc81c\uac70\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc804\uccb4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uae30\uacc4 \ube44\ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \ube44\ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc9c0\uc801\ud558\uba70, \ube44\ud559\uc2b5 \ud604\uc0c1\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uae4a\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uc774\ud574\ub97c \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6d0\ub798\uc758 \uc78a\uae30 \uc9c8\uc758\ub97c \ube44\ub3d9\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uad6c\uc870\ub85c \ud328\ub7ec\ud504\ub808\uc774\uc988\ud558\uc5ec \ube44\ud559\uc2b5 \uc804\uc5d0 \ubb38\ubc95\uc801 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ubb38\ubc95\uc801 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ube44\ud559\uc2b5 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5b5\uc81c\ud558\uace0 \uc78a\uae30\ub97c \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud558\uba70, \ube44\ud559\uc2b5 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \ubaa8\ub378 \uc720\uc6a9\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ub4dc\uc624\ud504\ub97c \ud06c\uac8c \uc644\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ube44\ud559\uc2b5 \ud604\uc0c1\uc758 \uadfc\ubcf8 \uc6d0\uc778\uc744 \ubb38\ubc95\uc801 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \ubc1d\ud788\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uae30\uacc4 \ube44\ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \ud2b9\uc815 \ucf58\ud150\uce20\ub97c \uc81c\uac70\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc804\uccb4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc78a\ud600\uc9c4 \uc815\ubcf4\uac00 \uc120\uc758\uc758 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \ub2e4\uc2dc \ub098\ud0c0\ub098\ub294 \uc120\uc758\uc758 \uc7ac\ud559\uc2b5 \ud604\uc0c1\uc740 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ube44\ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucde8\uc57d\ud568\uc744 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uc124\uba85\uc740 \uc774 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc8fc\uc81c\uc801 \uad00\ub828\uc131\uc5d0 \uae30\uc778\ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \uc124\uba85\uc774 \ubd88\ucda9\ubd84\ud558\ub2e4\uace0 \ubd05\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc8fc\uc81c\ubcf4\ub2e4\ub294 \uad6c\ubb38\uc801 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131\uc774 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc6d0\uc778\uc784\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0, \uad6c\ubb38\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub294 \uc8fc\uc81c\uc801 \uacb9\uce68 \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ud68c\ubcf5\uc744 \uc720\ubc1c\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc78a\ud600\uc9c4 \ucf58\ud150\uce20\uc640\uc758 \ud45c\ud604 \ubc0f \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \uc815\ub82c \ub54c\ubb38\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc6d0\ub798\uc758 \uc78a\uae30 \uc9c8\uc758\ub97c \ube44\ub3d9\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uad6c\uc870\ub85c \ud328\ub7ec\ud504\ub808\uc774\uc988\ud558\ub294 \uad6c\ubb38\uc801 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uc120\uc758\uc758 \uc7ac\ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5b5\uc81c\ud558\uace0 \uc78a\uae30\ub97c \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud558\uba70, \ube44\ud559\uc2b5 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \ubaa8\ub378 \uc720\uc6a9\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ub4dc\uc624\ud504\ub97c \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc644\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

This raises a fundamental question: what limits scaling, and why does diversity help? We present an information-theoretic framework showing that MAS performance is bounded by the intrinsic task uncertainty, not by agent count. We derive architecture-agnostic bounds demonstrating that improvements depend on how many effective channels the system accesses. Homogeneous agents saturate early because their outputs are strongly correlated, whereas heterogeneous agents contribute complementary evidence. We further introduce $K^*$, an effective channel count that quantifies the number of effective channels without ground-truth labels. Empirically, we show that heterogeneous configurations consistently outperform homogeneous scaling: 2 diverse agents can match or exceed the performance of 16 homogeneous agents. Our results provide principled guidelines for building efficient and robust MAS through diversity-aware design.

Under review", "summary": "Asynchronous pipeline parallelism maximizes hardware utilization by eliminating the pipeline bubbles inherent in synchronous execution, offering a path toward efficient large-scale distributed training. However, this efficiency gain can be compromised by gradient staleness, where the immediate model updates with delayed gradients introduce noise into the optimization process. Crucially, we identify a critical, yet often overlooked, pathology: this delay scales linearly with pipeline depth, fundamentally undermining the very scalability that the method originally intends to provide. In this work, we investigate this inconsistency and bridge the gap by rectifying delayed gradients through basis rotation, restoring scalable asynchronous training while maintaining performance. Specifically, we observe that the deleterious effects of delayed gradients are exacerbated when the Hessian eigenbasis is misaligned with the standard coordinate basis. We demonstrate that this misalignment prevents coordinate-wise adaptive schemes, such as Adam, from effectively leveraging curvature-aware adaptivity. This failure leads to significant oscillations in the optimization trajectory and, consequently, slower convergence. We substantiate these findings through both rigorous theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation. To address this challenge, we propose the use of basis rotation, demonstrating that it effectively mitigates the alignment issue and significantly accelerates convergence in asynchronous settings. For example, our training of a 1B-parameter LLM with basis rotation achieves the same training loss in 76.8% fewer iterations compared to the best-performing asynchronous pipeline parallel training

We present FigureBench, the first large-scale benchmark for generating scientific illustrations from long-form scientific texts. It contains 3,300 high-quality scientific text-figure pairs, covering diverse text-to-illustration tasks from scientific papers, surveys, blogs, and textbooks. Moreover, we propose AutoFigure, the first agentic framework that automatically generates high-quality scientific illustrations based on long-form scientific text. Specifically, before rendering the final result, AutoFigure engages in extensive thinking, recombination, and validation to produce a layout that is both structurally sound and aesthetically refined, outputting a scientific illustration that achieves both structural completeness and aesthetic appeal.

Existing symmetric frameworks often suffer from information allocation ambiguity, where the absence of structural inductive bias leads to semantic-specific leakage across modalities. We propose Asymmetric Hierarchical Anchoring (AHA), which enforces directional information allocation by designating a structured semantic anchor within a shared hierarchy. In our instantiation, we exploit the hierarchical discrete representations induced by audio Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) to guide video feature distillation into a shared semantic space. To ensure representational purity, we replace fragile mutual information estimators with a GRL-based adversarial decoupler that explicitly suppresses semantic leakage in modality-specific branches, and introduce Local Sliding Alignment (LSA) to encourage fine-grained temporal alignment across modalities. Extensive experiments on AVE and AVVP benchmarks demonstrate that AHA consistently outperforms symmetric baselines in cross-modal transfer. Additional analyses on talking-face disentanglement experiment further validate that the learned representations exhibit improved semantic consistency and disentanglement, indicating the broader applicability of the proposed framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ube44\ub300\uce6d \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc575\ucee4\ub9c1(AHA)\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ube44\ub514\uc624-\uc624\ub514\uc624 \uc804\ud658 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud560\ub2f9\ud558\uace0, \uacf5\ud1b5 \uc758\ubbf8 \uacf5\uac04\uc758 \uc815\ud654\uc640 \uc138\ubc00\ud55c \uc2dc\uac04 \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub300\uce6d \uae30\ubc18 \ub77c\uc778\ub4e4\uc744 \ucd08\uc6d4\ud55c \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc624\ub514\uc624-\ube44\uc8fc\uc5bc \uacf5\ub3d9 \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uc778\uc2dd\ud558\uace0, \ub808\uc774\ube14\uc774 \uc5c6\ub294 \ud0c0\uac9f \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\ub85c \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\uc774\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "\ube44\ub300\uce6d \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc575\ucee4\ub9c1(AHA) \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uacf5\uc720 \uacc4\uce35 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc758\ubbf8 \uc575\ucee4\ub97c \uc9c0\uc815\ud558\uace0, \ube44\ub514\uc624 \uae30\ub2a5 \uc99d\ub958\ub97c \ub9ac\ub4dc\ud558\ub294 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc774\uc0b0 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "AHA\uac00 AVE \ubc0f AVVP \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub300\uce6d \uae30\ubc95\ub4e4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc6b0\uc218\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uace0, \uc138\ubd80 \ud56d\ubaa9\uc5d0\uc11c \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uacfc \ubd84\ub9ac\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ub354 \ub113\uc740 \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uad50\ucc28 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uc77c\ubc18\ud654(CMG)\ud558\uc758 \uc624\ub514\uc624-\ube44\uc8fc\uc5bc \uacf5\ub3d9 \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \ub808\uc774\ube14\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uc6d0\ucc9c \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\uc5d0\uc11c \ub808\uc774\ube14\uc774 \uc5c6\ub294 \ud0c0\uac9f \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\ub85c \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc804\uc774\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud558\uba70, \ud1b5\ud569\ub41c \uc774\uc0b0 \ud45c\ud604 \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc9c4\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub300\uce6d \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc815\ubcf4 \ud560\ub2f9\uc758 \ubaa8\ud638\uc131\uc5d0 \uc2dc\ub2ec\ub9ac\uba70, \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc720\ub3c4 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc774 \uc5c6\uc73c\uba74 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0 \uac04\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \ub204\uc218\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ube44\ub300\uce6d \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc575\ucee4\ub9c1(AHA)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uacf5\uc720 \uacc4\uce35 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc758\ubbf8 \uc575\ucee4\ub97c \uc9c0\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \ubc29\ud5a5\uc131 \uc815\ubcf4 \ud560\ub2f9\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uad6c\ud604\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc624\ub514\uc624 \uc794\uc5ec \ubca1\ud130 \uc591\uc790\ud654(RVQ)\ub85c \uc720\ub3c4\ub41c \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc774\uc0b0 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ube44\ub514\uc624 \uae30\ub2a5 \uc99d\ub958\ub97c \uacf5\uc720 \uc758\ubbf8 \uacf5\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \uc548\ub0b4\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud45c\ud604\uc758 \uc21c\ub3c4\ub97c \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \ucde8\uc57d\ud55c \uc0c1\ud638 \uc815\ubcf4 \ucd94\uc815\uae30\ub97c GRL \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ub514\ucee4\ud50c\ub7ec\ub85c \ub300\uccb4\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0 \ud2b9\uc815 \uac00\uc9c0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \ub204\uc218\ub97c \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5b5\uc81c\ud558\uace0, \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0 \uac04\uc758 \uc138\ubc00\ud55c \uc2dc\uac04 \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\ub294 \ub85c\uceec \uc2ac\ub77c\uc774\ub529 \uc815\ub82c(LSA)\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4.

Despite this, most existing pretraining recipes are not anytime: they rely on horizon-dependent learning rate schedules and extensive tuning under a fixed compute budget. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating the existence of anytime learning schedules for overparameterized linear regression, and we highlight the central role of weight averaging - also known as model merging - in achieving the minimax convergence rates of stochastic gradient descent. We show that these anytime schedules polynomially decay with time, with the decay rate determined by the source and capacity conditions of the problem. Empirically, we evaluate 150M and 300M parameter language models trained at 1-32x Chinchilla scale, comparing constant learning rates with weight averaging and $1/\\sqrt{t}$ schedules with weight averaging against a well-tuned cosine schedule. Across the full training range, the anytime schedules achieve comparable final loss to cosine decay. Taken together, our results suggest that weight averaging combined with simple, horizon-free step sizes offers a practical and effective anytime alternative to cosine learning rate schedules for large

Boltzmann generators are generative models that enable independent sampling from the Boltzmann distribution of physical systems at a given temperature. However, their practical success depends on data-efficient training, as both simulation data and target energy evaluations are costly. To this end, we propose off-policy log-dispersion regularization (LDR), a novel regularization framework that builds on a generalization of the log-variance objective. We apply LDR in the off-policy setting in combination with standard data-based training objectives, without requiring additional on-policy samples. LDR acts as a shape regularizer of the energy landscape by leveraging additional information in the form of target energy labels. The proposed regularization framework is broadly applicable, supporting unbiased or biased simulation datasets as well as purely variational training without access to target samples. Across all benchmarks, LDR improves both final performance and data efficiency, with sample efficiency gains of up to one order of magnitude.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc624\ud504\ud3f4\ub9ac\uc2dc \ub85c\uadf8 \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc815\uaddc\ud654(LDR) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ubcfc\uce20\ub9cc \ubd84\ud3ec\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ube44\uc815\uaddc\ud654 \ud655\ub960 \ubc00\ub3c4\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uacfc\ud559\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc2ec\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc774\ub2e4. \ubcfc\uce20\ub9cc \uc0dd\uc131\uae30\ub294 \uc8fc\uc5b4\uc9c4 \uc628\ub3c4\uc5d0\uc11c \ubb3c\ub9ac \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ubcfc\uce20\ub9cc \ubd84\ud3ec\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc131\uacf5\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud6c8\ub828\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub85c\uadf8 \ubd84\uc0b0 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 \uc624\ud504\ud3f4\ub9ac\uc2dc \ub85c\uadf8 \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc815\uaddc\ud654(LDR)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

To appear in ICLR 2026", "summary": "Modern AI agents such as large language models are trained on diverse tasks -- translation, code generation, mathematical reasoning, and text prediction -- simultaneously. A key question is to quantify how each individual training task influences performance on a target task, a problem we refer to as task attribution. The direct approach, leave-one-out retraining, measures the effect of removing each task, but is computationally infeasible at scale. An alternative approach that builds surrogate models to predict a target task's performance for any subset of training tasks has emerged in recent literature. Prior work focuses on linear surrogate models, which capture first-order relationships, but miss nonlinear interactions such as synergy, antagonism, or XOR-type effects. In this paper, we first consider a unified task weighting framework for analyzing task attribution methods, and show a new connection between linear surrogate models and influence functions through a second-order analysis. Then, we introduce kernel surrogate models, which more effectively represent second-order task interactions. To efficiently learn the kernel surrogate, we develop a gradient-based estimation procedure that leverages a first-order approximation of pretrained models; empirically, this yields accurate estimates with less than $2\\%$ relative error without repeated retraining. Experiments across multiple domains -- including math reasoning in transformers, in-context learning, and multi-objective reinforcement learning -- demonstrate the effectiveness of kernel surrogate models. They achieve a $25\\%$ higher correlation with the leave-one-out ground truth than linear surrogates and influence-function baselines. When used for downstream task selection, kernel surrogate models yield a $40\\%$ improvement in demonstration selection for in-context learning and multi-objective reinforcement learning benchmarks.",

To solve this problem, we propose a Curriculum-Guided Feature Learning and Three-Stage Attention Network (CL3AN-GNN), a learning network that uses a three-step attention system (Engage, Enact, Embed) similar to how humans learn. The model begins by engaging with structurally simpler features, defined as (1) local neighbourhood patterns (1-hop), (2) low-degree node attributes, and (3) class-separable node pairs identified via initial graph convolutional networks and graph attention networks (GCN and GAT) embeddings. This foundation enables stable early learning despite label skew. The Enact stage then addresses complicated aspects: (1) connections that require multiple steps, (2) edges that connect different types of nodes, and (3) nodes at the edges of minority classes by using adjustable attention weights. Finally, Embed consolidates these features via iterative message passing and curriculum-aligned loss weighting. We evaluate CL3AN-GNN on eight Open Graph Benchmark datasets spanning social, biological, and citation networks. Experiments show consistent improvements across all datasets in accuracy, F1-score, and AUC over recent state-of-the-art methods. The model's step-by-step method works well with different types of graph datasets, showing quicker results than training everything at once, better performance on new, imbalanced graphs, and clear explanations of each step using gradient stability and attention correlation learning curves. This work provides both a theoretically grounded framework for curriculum learning in GNNs and practical evidence of its effectiveness against imbalances, validated through metrics, convergence speeds, and generalisation tests.", "AI": {"tldr": "CL3AN-GNN \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubd88\uade0\ud615 \ub178\ub4dc \ubd84\ub958 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ucee4\ub9ac\ud058\ub7fc \uac00\uc774\ub4dc \ud53c\ucc98 \ud559\uc2b5\uacfc 3\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc8fc\uc758 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\ubd80 \ub808\uc774\ube14\uc774 \uc9c0\ub098\uce58\uac8c \ud754\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ubd88\uacf5\uc815\ud558\uac8c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uace0 \ub35c \ud754\ud55c \ud074\ub798\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc800\ud558\ub418\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "3\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc8fc\uc758 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(Engage, Enact, Embed)\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \uba3c\uc800 \ubc30\uc6b0\uace0 \uc810\ucc28 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ubaa8\ub378\uc740 8\uac1c\uc758 Open Graph Benchmark \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uadfc\uc758 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4, F1-score, AUC \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uac1c\uc120 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 GNN\uc758 \ucee4\ub9ac\ud058\ub7fc \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \ubd88\uade0\ud615\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \uc2e4\uc99d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc99d\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(GNN)\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubd88\uade0\ud615 \ub178\ub4dc \ubd84\ub958\ub294 \uc77c\ubd80 \ub808\uc774\ube14\uc774 \ub2e4\ub978 \ub808\uc774\ube14\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud6e8\uc52c \ub354 \ud754\ud560 \ub54c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ubd88\uacf5\uc815\ud558\uac8c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uace0 \ub35c \ud754\ud55c \ud074\ub798\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc800\ud558\ub418\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\uc2dd\uacfc \uc720\uc0ac\ud558\uac8c 3\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc8fc\uc758 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(Engage, Enact, Embed)\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 Curriculum-Guided Feature Learning\uacfc Three-Stage Attention Network (CL3AN-GNN)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uba3c\uc800 \uad6c\uc870\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub354 \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \ud2b9\uc9d5(1) \ub85c\uceec \uc774\uc6c3 \ud328\ud134(1-hop), (2) \uc800\ucc28\uc6d0 \ub178\ub4dc \uc18d\uc131 \ubc0f (3) \ucd08\uae30 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ud569\uc131\uacf1 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc640 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc8fc\uc758 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c(GCN \ubc0f GAT) \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ub41c \ud074\ub798\uc2a4 \ubd84\ub9ac \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub178\ub4dc \uc30d)\uc5d0 \ucc38\uc5ec\ud558\uc5ec \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc2dc\uc791\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uae30\ucd08\ub294 \ub808\uc774\ube14 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \ucd08\uae30 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, in bandwidth-constrained distributed RL, scalability is often bottlenecked by the synchronization of policy weights from trainers to inference workers, particularly over commodity networks or in decentralized settings. While recent studies suggest that RL updates modify only a small fraction of model parameters, these observations are typically based on coarse checkpoint differences. We present a systematic empirical study of weight-update sparsity at both step-level and multi-step granularities, examining its evolution across training dynamics, off-policy delay, and model scale. We find that update sparsity is consistently high, frequently exceeding 99% across practically relevant settings. Leveraging this structure, we propose PULSE (Patch Updates via Lossless Sparse Encoding), a simple yet highly efficient lossless weight synchronization method that transmits only the indices and values of modified parameters. PULSE is robust to transmission errors and avoids floating-point drift inherent in additive delta schemes. In bandwidth-constrained decentralized environments, our approach achieves over 100x (14 GB to ~108 MB) communication reduction while maintaining bit-identical training dynamics and performance compared to full weight synchronization. By exploiting this structure, PULSE enables decentralized RL training to approach centralized throughput, reducing the bandwidth required for weight synchronization from 20 Gbit/s to 0.2 Gbit/s to maintain high GPU utilization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ubd84\uc0b0 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uac00\uc911\uce58 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8 \ud76c\uc18c\uc131\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uac00\uc911\uce58 \ub3d9\uae30\ud654\ub97c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 PULSE\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubd84\uc0b0 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ucc45 \uac00\uc911\uce58 \ub3d9\uae30\ud654\uac00 \uc131\ub2a5\uc758 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "\uac00\uc911\uce58 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8 \ud76c\uc18c\uc131\uc744 \ub2e8\uacc4 \uc218\uc900 \ubc0f \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc138\ubd84\ud654\ub85c \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uace0, PULSE\ub77c\ub294 \uc190\uc2e4 \uc5c6\ub294 \ud76c\uc18c \uc778\ucf54\ub529 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uac00\uc911\uce58 \ub3d9\uae30\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8 \ud76c\uc18c\uc131\uc774 99%\ub97c \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\uace0, PULSE\ub294 100\ubc30 \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uac10\uc18c\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "PULSE\ub294 \ubd84\uc0b0 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uc911\uc2dd \ucc98\ub9ac\ub7c9\uc5d0 \uac00\uae5d\uac8c \uc811\uadfc\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec, \uac00\uc911\uce58 \ub3d9\uae30\ud654\uc5d0 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ub300\uc5ed\ud3ed\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uc904\uc778\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc740 \uc0ac\ud6c4 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc694\uc18c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ub300\uc5ed\ud3ed\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ubd84\uc0b0 RL\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc815\ucc45 \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub97c \ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ub108\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd94\ub860 \uc791\uc5c5\uc790\ub85c \uc804\uc1a1\ud558\ub294 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc774 \uc885\uc885 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud558\uba70, \ud2b9\ud788 \uc77c\ubc18 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub098 \ubd84\uc0b0 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uadf8\ub807\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 RL \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\uac00 \ubaa8\ub378 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \uc911 \uadf9\ud788 \uc77c\ubd80\ub9cc \uc218\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uad00\ucc30\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac70\uce5c \uccb4\ud06c\ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8 \ucc28\uc774\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559, \uc624\ud504 \uc815\ucc45 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \ubc0f \ubaa8\ub378 \uaddc\ubaa8 \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc774\uc758 \uc9c4\ud654\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\ub294 \ub2e8\uacc4 \uc218\uc900 \ubc0f \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc138\ubd84\ud654\ub85c\uc11c \uac00\uc911\uce58 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8 \ud76c\uc18c\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8 \ud76c\uc18c\uc131\uc774 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub192\uac8c \uc720\uc9c0\ub418\uba70 \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad00\ub828 \uc788\ub294 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c 99%\ub97c \ub118\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \uc7a6\uc74c\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc218\uc815\ub41c \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\uc758 \uc778\ub371\uc2a4\uc640 \uac12\uc744 \uc804\uc1a1\ud558\ub294 \uac04\ub2e8\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc190\uc2e4 \uc5c6\ub294 \uac00\uc911\uce58 \ub3d9\uae30\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 PULSE(\uc190\uc2e4 \uc5c6\ub294 \ud76c\uc18c \uc778\ucf54\ub529\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \ud328\uce58 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.
