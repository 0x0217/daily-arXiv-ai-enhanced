This\nstudy systematically evaluates current-generation large language models (LLMs)\nin converting these prose abstracts into geographically accurate\nlatitude/longitude coordinates within a focused evaluation context. A digitized\ncorpus of 5,471 Virginia patent abstracts (1695-1732) is released, with 43\nrigorously verified test cases serving as an initial, geographically focused\nbenchmark. Six OpenAI models across three architectures (o-series, GPT-4-class,\nand GPT-3.5) were tested under two paradigms: direct-to-coordinate and\ntool-augmented chain-of-thought invoking external geocoding APIs. Results were\ncompared with a GIS-analyst baseline, the Stanford NER geoparser, Mordecai-3,\nand a county-centroid heuristic.\n  The top single-call model, o3-2025-04-16, achieved a mean error of 23 km\n(median 14 km), outperforming the median LLM (37.4 km) by 37.5%, the weakest\nLLM (50.3 km) by 53.5%, and external baselines by 67% (GIS analyst) and 70%\n(Stanford NER). A five-call ensemble further reduced errors to 19 km (median 12\nkm) at minimal additional cost (approx. USD 0.20 per grant), outperforming the\nmedian LLM by 48.6%. A patentee-name-redaction ablation increased error by\nabout 9%, indicating reliance on textual landmark and adjacency descriptions\nrather than memorization. The cost-efficient gpt-4o-2024-08-06 model maintained\na 28 km mean error at USD 1.09 per 1,000 grants, establishing a strong\ncost-accuracy benchmark; external geocoding tools offered no measurable benefit\nin this evaluation.\n  These findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs for scalable, accurate, and\ncost-effective historical georeferencing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294

To overcome\nthe communication bottlenecks associated with centralized parameter servers,\ndecentralized federated learning (DFL), which leverages peer-to-peer (P2P)\ncommunication, has been extensively explored in the research community.\nAlthough researchers design a variety of DFL approach to ensure model\nconvergence, its iterative learning process inevitably incurs considerable cost\nalong with the growth of model complexity and the number of participants. These\ncosts are largely influenced by the dynamic changes of topology in each\ntraining round, particularly its sparsity and connectivity conditions.\nFurthermore, the inherent resources heterogeneity in the edge environments\naffects energy efficiency of learning process, while data heterogeneity\ndegrades model performance. These factors pose significant challenges to the\ndesign of an effective DFL framework for EC systems. To this end, we propose\nHat-DFed, a heterogeneity-aware and coset-effective decentralized federated\nlearning (DFL) framework. In Hat-DFed, the topology construction is formulated\nas a dual optimization problem, which is then proven to be NP-hard, with the\ngoal of maximizing model performance while minimizing cumulative energy\nconsumption in complex edge environments. To solve this problem, we design a\ntwo-phase algorithm that dynamically constructs optimal communication\ntopologies while unbiasedly estimating their impact on both model performance\nand energy cost.

These\nchallenges are further amplified in multi-site scenarios that require\nsimultaneous modeling of temporal and spatial dynamics. To tackle this, we\nintroduce XFMNet, a stepwise multimodal fusion network that integrates remote\nsensing precipitation imagery to provide spatial and environmental context in\nriver networks. XFMNet first aligns temporal resolutions between water quality\nseries and remote sensing inputs via adaptive downsampling, followed by locally\nadaptive decomposition to disentangle trend and cycle components.

Semi-supervised\ndomain adaptation (SSDA) is a major approach for addressing this issue,\nassuming that a fully labeled training set (source domain) is available, but\nthe test set (target domain) provides labels only for a small subset. In this\nstudy, we propose a novel two-step momentum encoder-utilized SSDA framework,\nMoSSDA, for multivariate time-series classification. Time series data are\nhighly sensitive to noise, and sequential dependencies cause domain shifts\nresulting in critical performance degradation. To obtain a robust,\ndomain-invariant and class-discriminative representation, MoSSDA employs a\ndomain-invariant encoder to learn features from both source and target domains.\nSubsequently, the learned features are fed to a mixup-enhanced positive\ncontrastive module consisting of an online momentum encoder. The final\nclassifier is trained with learned features that exhibit consistency and\ndiscriminability with limited labeled target domain data, without data\naugmentation. We applied a two-stage process by separating the gradient flow\nbetween the encoders and the classifier to obtain rich and complex\nrepresentations. Through extensive experiments on six diverse datasets, MoSSDA\nachieved state-of-the-art performance for three different backbones and various\nunlabeled ratios in the target domain data. The Ablation study confirms that\neach module, including two-stage learning, is effective in improving the\nperformance.

The main goal of this paper is to show that these properties are\ncentral to many applications in causal inference. For example, subobject\nclassifiers allow a categorical formulation of causal intervention, which\ncreates sub-models. Limits and colimits allow causal diagrams of arbitrary\ncomplexity to be ``solved\", using a novel interpretation of causal\napproximation. Exponential objects enable reasoning about equivalence classes\nof operations on causal models, such as covered edge reversal and causal\nhomotopy. Analogous to structural causal models (SCMs), TCMs are defined by a\ncollection of functions, each defining a ``local autonomous\" causal mechanism\nthat assemble to induce a unique global function from exogenous to endogenous\nvariables. Since the category of TCMs is (co)complete, which we prove in this\npaper, every causal diagram has a ``solution\" in the form of a (co)limit: this\nimplies that any arbitrary causal model can be ``approximated\" by some global\nfunction with respect to the morphisms going into or out of the diagram.\nNatural transformations are crucial in measuring the quality of approximation.\nIn addition, we show that causal interventions are modeled by subobject\nclassifiers: any sub-model is defined by a monic arrow into its parent model.\nExponential objects permit reasoning about entire classes of causal\nequivalences and interventions.

Existing studies have been focused on exhaustively explore the\nspatial-temporal correlations. However, they often overlook the underlying\ncharacteristics of cellular traffic, which are shaped by the sporadic and\nbursty nature of telecom services. Additionally, concept drift creates\nsubstantial obstacles to maintaining satisfactory accuracy in continuous\ncellular forecasting tasks. To resolve these problems, we put forward an online\ncellular traffic prediction method grounded in Multi-Grained Spatial-Temporal\nfeature Complementarity (MGSTC). The proposed method is devised to achieve\nhigh-precision predictions in practical continuous forecasting scenarios.\nConcretely, MGSTC segments historical data into chunks and employs the\ncoarse-grained temporal attention to offer a trend reference for the prediction\nhorizon. Subsequently, fine-grained spatial attention is utilized to capture\ndetailed correlations among network elements, which enables localized\nrefinement of the established trend. The complementarity of these multi-grained\nspatial-temporal features facilitates the efficient transmission of valuable\ninformation. To accommodate continuous forecasting needs, we implement an\nonline learning strategy that can detect concept drift in real-time and\npromptly switch to the appropriate parameter update stage.

Obtaining good\napproximation sets for highly constrained many-objective problems is often a\ndifficult task even for modern multiobjective algorithms. In some cases,\nmultiple instances of the problem scenario present similarities in their\nfitness landscapes. That is, there are recurring features in the fitness\nlandscapes when searching for solutions to different problem instances. We\npropose a methodology to exploit this characteristic by solving one instance of\na given problem scenario using computationally expensive multiobjective\nalgorithms to obtain a good approximation set and then using Goal Programming\nwith efficient single-objective algorithms to solve other instances of the same\nproblem scenario. We use three goal-based objective functions and show that on\nbenchmark instances of the multiobjective vehicle routing problem with time\nwindows, the methodology is able to produce good results in short computation\ntime.

Therefore, we construct MERP\n(Multi-class Error in Robotic Prostatectomy), a comprehensive dataset for error\ndetection in robotic prostatectomy with frame-level annotations featuring six\nclinically aligned error categories. In addition, we propose CARES\n(Collaborative Agentic Reasoning for Error Detection in Surgery), a novel\nzero-shot clinically-informed and risk-stratified agentic reasoning\narchitecture for multi-class surgical error detection. CARES implements\nadaptive generation of medically informed, error-specific Chain-of-Thought\n(CoT) prompts across multiple expertise levels. The framework employs\nrisk-aware routing to assign error task to expertise-matched reasoning pathways\nbased on complexity and clinical impact. Subsequently, each pathway decomposes\nsurgical error analysis into three specialized agents with temporal, spatial,\nand procedural analysis. Each agent analyzes using dynamically selected prompts\ntailored to the assigned expertise level and error type, generating detailed\nand transparent reasoning traces. By incorporating clinically informed\nreasoning from established surgical assessment guidelines, CARES enables\nzero-shot surgical error detection without prior training. Evaluation\ndemonstrates superior performance with 54.3 mF1 on RARP and 52.0 mF1 on MERP\ndatasets, outperforming existing zero-shot approaches by up to 14% while\nremaining competitive with trained models.

We present a novel theoretical framework that\nreinterprets the core computation of attention as Pavlovian conditioning. Our\nmodel finds a direct mathematical analogue in linear attention, which\nsimplifies the analysis of the underlying associative process. We demonstrate\nthat attention's queries, keys, and values can be mapped to the three elements\nof classical conditioning: test stimuli that probe associations, conditional\nstimuli (CS) that serve as retrieval cues, and unconditional stimuli (US) that\ncontain response information. Through this lens, we suggest that each attention\noperation constructs a transient associative memory via a Hebbian rule, where\nCS-US pairs form dynamic associations that test stimuli can later retrieve. Our\nframework yields several theoretical insights grounded in this linearized\nmodel: (1) a capacity theorem showing that attention heads can store\nO($\\sqrt{d_k}$) associations before interference degrades retrieval; (2) an\nerror propagation analysis revealing fundamental architectural trade-offs of\nbalancing model depth, width, and head redundancy to maintain reliability; and\n(3) an understanding of how biologically plausible learning rules could enhance\ntransformer architectures.

However, in real-world\ndeployments, failures of computational components are inevitable, presenting a\ncritical challenge: ensuring that multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)\npolicies remain effective even when some agents malfunction. We propose the\nMulti-Agent Robust Training Algorithm (MARTA), a plug-and-play framework for\ntraining MARL agents to be resilient to potentially severe faults. MARTA\noperates in cooperative multi-agent settings where agents may lose the ability\nto execute their intended actions. It learns to identify failure scenarios that\nare especially detrimental to system performance and equips agents with\nstrategies to mitigate their impact. At the heart of MARTA is a novel\nadversarial Markov game in which an adversary -- modelled via \\emph{Markov\nswitching controls} -- learns to disable agents in high-risk state regions,\nwhile the remaining agents are trained to \\emph{jointly} best-respond to such\ntargeted malfunctions. To ensure practicality, MARTA enforces a malfunction\nbudget, constraining the adversary to a fixed number of failures and learning\nrobust policies accordingly. We provide theoretical guarantees that MARTA\nconverges to a Markov perfect equilibrium, ensuring agents optimally counteract\nworst-case faults.

However, it exposes a new class of timing\nside-channel attacks, enabling adversaries to infer sensitive user inputs via\nshared cache entries. Existing defenses, such as per-user isolation, eliminate\nleakage but degrade performance by up to 38.9% in time-to-first-token (TTFT),\nmaking them impractical for high-throughput deployment. To address this gap, we\nintroduce SafeKV (Secure and Flexible KV Cache Sharing), a privacy-aware\nKV-cache management framework that selectively shares non-sensitive entries\nwhile confining sensitive content to private caches. SafeKV comprises three\ncomponents: (i) a hybrid, multi-tier detection pipeline that integrates\nrule-based pattern matching, a general-purpose privacy detector, and\ncontext-aware validation; (ii) a unified radix-tree index that manages public\nand private entries across heterogeneous memory tiers (HBM, DRAM, SSD); and\n(iii) entropy-based access monitoring to detect and mitigate residual\ninformation leakage. Our evaluation shows that SafeKV mitigates 94% - 97% of\ntiming-based side-channel attacks. Compared to per-user isolation method,\nSafeKV improves TTFT by up to 40.58% and throughput by up to 2.66X across\ndiverse LLMs and workloads.

However, many\ndeep learning frameworks deliver a single material class prediction and operate\non a per-pixel basis; such approaches are limited in their interpretability and\nrestricted to predicting materials that are accessible in available training\nlibraries. In this work, we present an inverse modeling approach in the form of\na physics-conditioned generative model.A probabilistic latent-variable model\nlearns the underlying distribution of HSI radiance measurements and produces\nthe conditional distribution of the emissivity spectrum. Moreover, estimates of\nthe HSI scene's atmosphere and background are used as a physically relevant\nconditioning mechanism to contextualize a given radiance measurement during the\nencoding and decoding processes. Furthermore, we employ an in-the-loop\naugmentation scheme and physics-based loss criteria to avoid bias towards a\npredefined training material set and to encourage the model to learn physically\nconsistent inverse mappings. Monte-Carlo sampling of the model's conditioned\nposterior delivers a sought emissivity distribution and allows for\ninterpretable uncertainty quantification. Moreover, a distribution-based\nmaterial matching scheme is presented to return a set of likely material\nmatches for an inferred emissivity distribution. Hence, we present a strategy\nto incorporate contextual information about a given HSI scene, capture the\npossible variation of underlying material spectra, and provide interpretable\nprobability measures of a candidate material accounting for given\nremotely-sensed radiance measurement.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc815\ub41c \uc0dd\uc131

We propose a new interaction paradigm, First Ask Then Answer\n(FATA), in which, through prompt words, LLMs are guided to proactively generate\nmultidimensional supplementary questions for users prior to response\ngeneration. Subsequently, by integrating user-provided supplementary\ninformation with the original query through sophisticated prompting techniques,\nwe achieve substantially improved response quality and relevance. In contrast\nto existing clarification approaches -- such as the CLAM framework oriented to\nambiguity and the self-interrogation Self-Ask method -- FATA emphasizes\ncompleteness (beyond mere disambiguation) and user participation (inviting\nhuman input instead of relying solely on model-internal reasoning). It also\nadopts a single-turn strategy: all clarifying questions are produced at once,\nthereby reducing dialogue length and improving efficiency. Conceptually, FATA\nuses the reasoning power of LLMs to scaffold user expression, enabling\nnon-expert users to formulate more comprehensive and contextually relevant\nqueries. To evaluate FATA, we constructed a multi-domain benchmark and compared\nit with two controls: a baseline prompt (B-Prompt) and a context-enhanced\nexpert prompt (C-Prompt).

While IC\ncamouflage techniques have emerged to mitigate these risks, existing approaches\nlargely focus on localized gate modifications, neglecting comprehensive\ndeception strategies. To address this gap, we present a machine learning\n(ML)-driven methodology that integrates cryptic and mimetic cyber deception\nprinciples to enhance IC security against RE. Our approach leverages a novel\nAnd-Inverter Graph Variational Autoencoder (AIG-VAE) to encode circuit\nrepresentations, enabling dual-layered camouflage through functional\npreservation and appearance mimicry. By introducing new variants of covert\ngates -- Fake Inverters, Fake Buffers, and Universal Transmitters -- our\nmethodology achieves robust protection by obscuring circuit functionality while\npresenting misleading appearances. Experimental results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our strategy in maintaining circuit functionality while\nachieving high camouflage and similarity scores with minimal structural\noverhead. Additionally, we validate the robustness of our method against\nadvanced artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced RE attacks, highlighting its\npractical applicability in securing IC designs.

The elements that AI should fulfill within information systems\nare classified under the ISA. The EIA includes elements that affect\nstakeholders as a result of AI being attacked or misused. For each element,\ncorresponding negative impacts are identified. By referring to the AI security\nmap, one can understand the potential negative impacts, along with their causes\nand countermeasures.

However, the lack of common benchmarks, including\ndatasets, code and comparison metrics, makes their evaluation and comparison\nhard. In that context, we propose an open-source benchmark that comprises\nsimulated datasets of various {\\gamma}-spectrometry settings, codes of\ndifferent analysis approaches and evaluation metrics. This allows us to compare\nthe state-of-the-art end-to-end machine learning with a statistical unmixing\napproach using the full spectrum. Three scenarios have been investigated: (1)\nspectral signatures are assumed to be known; (2) spectral signatures are\ndeformed due to physical phenomena such as Compton scattering and attenuation;\nand (3) spectral signatures are shifted (e.g., due to temperature variation). A\nlarge dataset of 200000 simulated spectra containing nine radionuclides with an\nexperimental natural background is used for each scenario with multiple\nradionuclides present in the spectrum. Regarding identification performance,\nthe statistical approach consistently outperforms the machine learning\napproaches across all three scenarios for all comparison metrics. However, the\nperformance of the statistical approach can be significantly impacted when\nspectral signatures are not modeled correctly.

To mitigate these challenges, the\nimplementation of robust defense strategies is critically important. A thorough\nprocess of anomaly identification and detection in information and\ncommunication technology (ICT) frameworks is crucial to ensure secure and\nreliable communication and coordination between interconnected devices within\ndigital substations. Hence, this paper addresses the critical cybersecurity\nchallenges confronting IEC61850-based digital substations within modern smart\ngrids, where the integration of advanced communication protocols, e.g., generic\nobject-oriented substation event (GOOSE), has enhanced energy management and\nintroduced significant vulnerabilities to cyberattacks. Focusing on the\nlimitations of traditional anomaly detection systems (ADSs) in detecting\nthreats, this research proposes a transformative approach by leveraging\ngenerative AI (GenAI) to develop robust ADSs. The primary contributions include\nthe suggested advanced adversarial traffic mutation (AATM) technique to\ngenerate synthesized and balanced datasets for GOOSE messages, ensuring\nprotocol compliance and enabling realistic zero-day attack pattern creation to\naddress data scarcity. Then, the implementation of GenAI-based ADSs\nincorporating the task-oriented dialogue (ToD) processes has been explored for\nimproved detection of attack patterns. Finally, a comparison of the GenAI-based\nADS with machine learning (ML)-based ADSs has been implemented to showcase the\noutperformance of the GenAI-based frameworks considering the

One weakness of MCTS is\nthat it spends a significant time deciding which node to expand next. While\nselecting a node from an OPEN list with $N$ nodes has $O(1)$ runtime complexity\nwith traditional array-based priority-queues for dense integer keys, the\ntree-based OPEN list used by MCTS requires $O(\\log N)$, which roughly\ncorresponds to the search depth $d$. In classical planning, $d$ is arbitrarily\nlarge (e.g., $2^k-1$ in $k$-disk Tower-of-Hanoi) and the runtime for node\nselection is significant, unlike in game tree search, where the cost is\nnegligible compared to the node evaluation (rollouts) because $d$ is inherently\nlimited by the game (e.g., $d\\leq 361$ in Go). To improve this bottleneck, we\npropose a bilevel modification to MCTS that runs a best-first search from each\nselected leaf node with an expansion budget proportional to $d$, which achieves\namortized $O(1)$ runtime for node selection, equivalent to the traditional\nqueue-based OPEN list.

However, GNN suffers from the over-smoothing problem,\nwhere node-level features collapse in deep GNN layers. While existing feature\nprojection methods with cross-attention have been introduced to mitigate this\nissue, they still perform poorly in deep features. This motivated our\nexploration of using Mamba as an alternative projector for its ability to\nhandle complex sequences. However, we observe that while Mamba excels at\npreserving global topological information from deep layers, it neglects\nfine-grained details in shallow layers. The capabilities of Mamba and\ncross-attention exhibit a global-local trade-off. To resolve this critical\nglobal-local trade-off, we propose Hierarchical and Structure-Aware Network\n(HSA-Net), a novel framework with two modules that enables a hierarchical\nfeature projection and fusion. Firstly, a Hierarchical Adaptive Projector (HAP)\nmodule is introduced to process features from different graph layers. It learns\nto dynamically switch between a cross-attention projector for shallow layers\nand a structure-aware Graph-Mamba projector for deep layers, producing\nhigh-quality, multi-level features. Secondly, to adaptively merge these\nmulti-level features, we design a Source-Aware Fusion (SAF) module, which\nflexibly selects fusion experts based on the characteristics of the aggregation\nfeatures, ensuring a precise and effective final representation fusion.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our HSA-Net framework quantitatively and\nqualitatively outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "HSA-Net\uc740 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc758 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c-\ub85c\uceec \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uace0\uc548\ub41c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ud2b9\uc131 \ud504\ub85c\uc81d\uc158\uacfc \uc735\ud569\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "GNN\uc758 \uc624\ubc84 \uc2a4\ubb34\ub529 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0, \uae4a\uc740 \ud2b9\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 Mamba\ub97c \ub300\uc548 \ud504\ub85c\uc81d\ud130\ub85c \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\uba70, \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c-\ub85c\uceec \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ucc3e\uc74c.", "method": "\uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ud504\ub85c\uc81d\ud130(HAP) \ubaa8\ub4c8\uacfc \uc18c\uc2a4 \uc778\uc9c0 \uc735\ud569(SAF) \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c HSA-Net \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud568.", "result": "HSA-Net\uc740 \uc815\ub7c9\uc801 \ubc0f \uc815\uc131\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud604\uc7ac \ucd5c\uc2e0 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc744 \ub2a5\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90c.", "conclusion": "HSA-Net\uc740 GNN\uc758 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c-\ub85c\uceec \ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ub4dc\uc624\ud504\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \ud2b9\uc131 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud568.", "translated_summary": "\ubd84\uc790 \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \ubd84\uc790 \ucea1\uc154\ub2dd \ubc0f \ubd84\uc790 \uc18d\uc131 \uc608\uce21\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ub2e4\uc6b4\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9bc \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \ucd08\uc11d\uc73c\ub85c, \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(GNN)\uc5d0 \ud06c\uac8c \uc758\uc874\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 GNN\uc740 \uae4a\uc740 GNN \uce35\uc5d0\uc11c \ub178\ub4dc \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc774 \ubd95\uad34\ub418\ub294 \uc624\ubc84 \uc2a4\ubb34\ub529 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uacaa\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc644\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uad50\ucc28 \uc8fc\uc758\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud2b9\uc9d5 \ud504\ub85c\uc81d\uc158 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ub3c4\uc785\ub418\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae4a\uc740 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc88b\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\ub97c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc73c\ub85c Mamba\ub97c \ub300\uc548 \ud504\ub85c\uc81d\ud130\ub85c \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc774\ub04c\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 Mamba\uac00 \uae4a\uc740 \uce35\uc5d0\uc11c \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uc704\uc0c1 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc798 \ubcf4\uc874\ud558\ub294 \ubc18\uba74, \uc595\uc740 \uce35\uc758 \uc138\ubd80 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc18c\ud640\ud788 \ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uad00\ucc30\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Standard approaches generate all combinations of induction\nvariables and use partial evaluation to discard those that simplify to identity\nelements of associative-commutative operators (e.g. true for conjunction, 0 for\nsummation). This can be inefficient for problems where most combinations are\nultimately irrelevant. We present a method that avoids full enumeration by\nusing a solver to compute only the combinations required to generate the final\nset of constraints.

Attackers create adversarial examples by adding small\nchanges (i.e., perturbations) to the attack features to evade or fool the deep\nlearning model. This paper introduces the concept of low-level behavioral\nadversarial examples and its threat model of evasive ransomware. We formulate\nthe method and the threat model to generate the optimal source code of evasive\nmalware.

However, existing FL\nframeworks often overlook the computational heterogeneity of edge clients and\nthe growing training burden on resource-limited devices. However, FL suffers\nfrom high communication costs and complex model aggregation, especially with\nlarge models. Previous works combine split learning (SL) and hierarchical FL\n(HierFL) to reduce device-side computation and improve scalability, but this\nintroduces training complexity due to coordination across tiers. To address\nthese issues, we propose SHeRL-FL, which integrates SL and hierarchical model\naggregation and incorporates representation learning at intermediate layers. By\nallowing clients and edge servers to compute training objectives independently\nof the cloud, SHeRL-FL significantly reduces both coordination complexity and\ncommunication overhead. To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of\nSHeRL-FL, we performed experiments on image classification tasks using\nCIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and HAM10000 with AlexNet, ResNet-18, and ResNet-50 in\nboth IID and non-IID settings. In addition, we evaluate performance on image\nsegmentation tasks using the ISIC-2018 dataset with a ResNet-50-based U-Net.\nExperimental results demonstrate that SHeRL-FL reduces data transmission by\nover 90\\% compared to centralized FL and HierFL, and by 50\\% compared to\nSplitFed, which is a hybrid of FL and SL, and further improves hierarchical\nsplit learning methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "SHeRL-FL\uc740 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uace0 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud655\uc7a5\uc131 \ubc0f \ub300\uae30 \uc2dc\uac04 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc790\ub294 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "SL\uacfc \uacc4\uce35 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc9d1\uacc4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uace0 \uc911\uac04 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 SHeRL-FL\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "SHeRL-FL\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc804\uc1a1\uc744 90% \uc774\uc0c1 \uc904\uc774\uace0, SplitFed\uc640 \ube44\uad50\ud574\ub3c4 50% \uc904\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "SHeRL-FL\uc740 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uacfc \uacc4\uce35 \ubd84\ud560 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uc5ec \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5(FL)\uc740 \uc6d0\uc2dc \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uacf5\uc720\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0\ub3c4 \ud611\ub825\uc801\uc778 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud655\uc7a5\uc131 \ubc0f \uc9c0\uc5f0 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874\uc758 FL \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc5e3\uc9c0 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\uc758 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131\uacfc \ub9ac\uc18c\uc2a4 \uc81c\ud55c \uc7a5\uce58\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubd80\ub2f4\uc744 \uc885\uc885 \uac04\uacfc\ud55c\ub2e4.

LLM inference comprises\nprefill (compute-bound) and decode (memory-bound) stages, with decode\ndominating latency particularly for long sequences. Current decoder-only models\nhandle both stages uniformly, despite their distinct computational profiles. We\npropose OverFill, which decouples these stages to optimize accuracy-efficiency\ntradeoffs. OverFill begins with a full model for prefill, processing system and\nuser inputs in parallel. It then switches to a dense pruned model, while\ngenerating tokens sequentially. Leveraging more compute during prefill,\nOverFill improves generation quality with minimal latency overhead.

In this approach, each clause - a\nlogical pattern composed of binary literals mapped to input data - is\ndisqualified from voting if even a single literal fails. Due to this strict\nrequirement, standard TMs must employ thousands of clauses to achieve\ncompetitive accuracy. This paper introduces the Fuzzy-Pattern Tsetlin Machine\n(FPTM), a novel variant where clause evaluation is fuzzy rather than strict. If\nsome literals in a clause fail, the remaining ones can still contribute to the\noverall vote with a proportionally reduced score. As a result, each clause\neffectively consists of sub-patterns that adapt individually to the input,\nenabling more flexible, efficient, and robust pattern matching. The proposed\nfuzzy mechanism significantly reduces the required number of clauses, memory\nfootprint, and training time, while simultaneously improving accuracy. On the\nIMDb dataset, FPTM achieves 90.15% accuracy with only one clause per class, a\n50x reduction in clauses and memory over the Coalesced Tsetlin Machine. FPTM\ntrains up to 316x faster (45 seconds vs. 4 hours) and fits within 50 KB,\nenabling online learning on microcontrollers.

These challenges highlight the urgent need for robust AI governance. We\npropose a comprehensive framework integrating technical and societal\ndimensions, structured around three interconnected pillars: Intrinsic Security\n(system reliability), Derivative Security (real-world harm mitigation), and\nSocial Ethics (value alignment and accountability). Uniquely, our approach\nunifies technical methods, emerging evaluation benchmarks, and policy insights\nto promote transparency, accountability, and trust in AI systems. Through a\nsystematic review of over 300 studies, we identify three core challenges: (1)\nthe generalization gap, where defenses fail against evolving threats; (2)\ninadequate evaluation protocols that overlook real-world risks; and (3)\nfragmented regulations leading to inconsistent oversight. These shortcomings\nstem from treating governance as an afterthought, rather than a foundational\ndesign principle, resulting in reactive, siloed efforts that fail to address\nthe interdependence of technical integrity and societal trust. To overcome\nthis, we present an integrated research agenda that bridges technical rigor\nwith social responsibility. Our framework offers actionable guidance for\nresearchers, engineers, and policymakers to develop AI systems that are not\nonly robust and secure but also ethically aligned and publicly trustworthy.

This work provides a first-principles justification for SDPA. We\nfirst show that the attention forward pass is the exact solution to a\ndegenerate, one-sided Entropic Optimal Transport (EOT) problem, which seeks a\ndistribution that maximizes similarity while being maximally entropic. This\noptimization perspective has a direct consequence for the backward pass. We\nprove that the standard gradient computed via backpropagation is mathematically\nidentical to an advantage-based policy gradient, a variance-reduced update rule\nfrom reinforcement learning. Crucially, we demonstrate that the EOT formulation\nof the forward pass induces a specific information geometry on the space of\nattention distributions. It is this geometry, characterized by the Fisher\nInformation Matrix, that dictates the precise form of the learning gradient,\nrevealing the advantage-based update as a natural consequence of the\noptimization problem being solved.

Recent work has focused on improving label quality or\nmitigating particular biases, but we identify a more fundamental limitation:\nthese methods collect the wrong kind of data. We prove an impossibility result:\nno algorithm relying solely on ordinal comparisons can systematically recover\nthe most preferred model. Intuitively, ordinal data lacks the information\nneeded to resolve tradeoffs -- e.g., fixing a factual error on one prompt\nversus improving style on another. We show that selecting the optimal model\nrequires recovering preferences over \\emph{models} (rather than just\nresponses), which can only be identified given cardinal feedback about response\nquality. To address this, we collect and publicly release a dataset of 25,000\ncardinal judgments using willingness-to-pay elicitations, a well-established\ntool from experimental economics.

Consequently,\nthis problem has been studied intensively in recent literature. Our algorithm,\nOffline-Online Phased Elimination (OOPE), effectively incorporates the offline\ndata to substantially reduce the online regret compared to prior work. To\nleverage offline information prudently, OOPE uses an extended D-optimal design\nwithin each exploration phase. OOPE achieves an online regret is\n$\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{\\deff T \\log \\left(|\\mathcal{A}|T\\right)}+d^2)$. $\\deff \\leq\nd)$ is the effective problem dimension which measures the number of poorly\nexplored directions in offline data and depends on the eigen-spectrum\n$(\\lambda_k)_{k \\in [d]}$ of the Gram matrix of the offline data. The\neigen-spectrum $(\\lambda_k)_{k \\in [d]}$ is a quantitative measure of the\n\\emph{quality} of offline data. If the offline data is poorly explored ($\\deff\n\\approx d$), we recover the established regret bounds for purely online setting\nwhile, when offline data is abundant ($\\Toff >> T$) and well-explored ($\\deff =\no(1) $), the online regret reduces substantially. Additionally, we provide the\nfirst known minimax regret lower bounds in this setting that depend explicitly\non the quality of the offline data. These lower bounds establish the optimality\nof our algorithm in regimes where offline data is either well-explored or\npoorly explored. Finally, by using a Frank-Wolfe approximation to the extended\noptimal design we further improve the $O(d^{2})$ term to\n$O\\left(\\frac{d^{2}}{\\deff} \\min \\{ \\deff,1\\} \\right)$, which can be\nsubstantial in high dimensions with moderate quality of offline data $\\deff =\n\\Omega(1)$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uc120\ud615 \ubc34\ub514\ud2b8\uc758 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ud6c4\ud68c \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8f9\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ucd94\ucc9c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c, \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uad11\uace0 \ub4f1 \ud3ed\ub113\uc740 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc774 \uc788\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \ucd5c\uadfc \ubb38\ud5cc\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9d1\uc911\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5f0\uad6c\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc778 OOPE(\uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778-\uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ub2e8\uacc4 \uc0ad\uc81c)\ub294 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\uc874 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ud6c4\ud68c\ub97c \ud06c\uac8c \uc904\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "OOPE\ub294 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ud6c4\ud68c\uac00 $\tilde{O}(\text{sqrt}(\text{deff} T \text{log} \big(|\text{A}|T\big)) +d^2)$\uc784\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801\uc131\uc740 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \uc798 \ud0d0\uc0c9\ub418\uac70\ub098 \uc798 \ud0d0\uc0c9\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \uc601\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c \uc99d\uba85\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uae30\uc800 \ubc34\ub514\ud2b8 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c\ubd80\ud130\uc758 \uc774\uc804 \uad00\uce21(\uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130)\uc5d0 \uc811\uadfc\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc120\ud615 \ubc34\ub514\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ud6c4\ud68c \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uace0\ub824\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd94\ucc9c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c, \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uad11\uace0 \ub4f1\uacfc \uac19\uc774 \ud3ed\ub113\uc740 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \ucd5c\uadfc \ubb38\ud5cc\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9d1\uc911\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5f0\uad6c\ub418\uc5b4 \uc654\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc778 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778-\uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ub2e8\uacc4 \uc0ad\uc81c(OOPE)\ub294 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\uc804 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ud6c4\ud68c\ub97c \ud06c\uac8c \uc904\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Recently,\nembedding fingerprints into LLMs has emerged as a prevalent method for\nestablishing model ownership. However, existing back-door-based methods suffer\nfrom limited stealth and efficiency. To simultaneously address these issues, we\npropose EditMF, a training-free fingerprinting paradigm that achieves highly\nimperceptible fingerprint embedding with minimal computational overhead.\nOwnership bits are mapped to compact, semantically coherent triples drawn from\nan encrypted artificial knowledge base (e.g., virtual author-novel-protagonist\nfacts). Causal tracing localizes the minimal set of layers influencing each\ntriple, and a zero-space update injects the fingerprint without perturbing\nunrelated knowledge. Verification requires only a single black-box query and\nsucceeds when the model returns the exact pre-embedded protagonist. Empirical\nresults on LLaMA and Qwen families show that EditMF combines high\nimperceptibility with negligible model's performance loss, while delivering\nrobustness far beyond LoRA-based fingerprinting and approaching that of SFT\nembeddings.

Such\n2D-state RNNs, known as Fast Weight Programmers (FWPs), can be interpreted as a\nneural network whose synaptic weights (called fast weights) dynamically change\nover time as a function of input observations, and serve as short-term memory\nstorage; corresponding synaptic weight modifications are controlled or\nprogrammed by another network (the programmer) whose parameters are trained\n(e.g., by gradient descent). In this Primer, we review the technical\nfoundations of FWPs, their computational characteristics, and their connections\nto transformers and state space models.

In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using Large Language\nModels (LLM) as an alternative to the domain expert.

Most causal discovery algorithms rely on two key\nassumptions: (i) all variables are observed, and (ii) the underlying causal\ngraph is acyclic. While these assumptions simplify theoretical analysis, they\nare often violated in real-world systems, such as biological networks. Existing\nmethods that account for confounders either assume linearity or struggle with\nscalability. To address these limitations, we propose DCCD-CONF, a novel\nframework for differentiable learning of nonlinear cyclic causal graphs in the\npresence of unmeasured confounders using interventional data. Our approach\nalternates between optimizing the graph structure and estimating the confounder\ndistribution by maximizing the log-likelihood of the data. Through experiments\non synthetic data and real-world gene perturbation datasets, we show that\nDCCD-CONF outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both causal graph recovery\nand confounder identification.

Built on the\nGeneral Video Game AI framework, it features a diverse collection of\narcade-style games designed to test a model's ability to handle tasks that\ndiffer from most existing LLM benchmarks. The benchmark leverages a game\ndescription language that enables rapid creation of new games and levels,\nhelping to prevent overfitting over time. Each game scene is represented by a\ncompact set of ASCII characters, allowing for efficient processing by language\nmodels. GVGAI-LLM defines interpretable metrics, including the meaningful step\nratio, step efficiency, and overall score, to assess model behavior. Through\nzero-shot evaluations across a broad set of games and levels with diverse\nchallenges and skill depth, we reveal persistent limitations of LLMs in spatial\nreasoning and basic planning. Current models consistently exhibit spatial and\nlogical errors, motivating structured prompting and spatial grounding\ntechniques.

In particular, the\nso-called Load Altering Attacks (LAAs) can trigger rapid frequency fluctuations\nand potentially destabilize the power grid. This paper aims to bridge the gap\nbetween academic research and practical application by using open-source\ndatasets released by grid operators. It investigates various LAA scenarios on a\nreal-world transmission network, namely the Great Britain (GB)-36 Zone model\nreleased by the UK's National Electricity System Operator (NESO). It evaluates\nthe threshold of LAA severity that the grid can tolerate before triggering\ncascading effects. Additionally, it explores how Battery Energy Storage Systems\n(BESS) based fast frequency response services can mitigate or prevent such\nimpacts. Simulations are conducted using DIgSILENT PowerFactory to ensure\nrealistic system representation. The analysis provides several useful insights\nto grid operators on the LAA impact, such as the influence of the relative\nlocations of BESS and LAA, as well as how delays in attack execution

This paper introduces a novel\napproach for automated liver tumor segmentation in computed tomography (CT)\nimages by integrating a 3D U-Net architecture with the Bat Algorithm for\nhyperparameter optimization. The method enhances segmentation accuracy and\nrobustness by intelligently optimizing key parameters like the learning rate\nand batch size.

Synthetic data offers a promising alternative; however, generating\nrealistic, clinically valid, and privacy-conscious records remains a major\nchallenge. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new\nopportunities for structured data generation; however, existing approaches\nfrequently lack systematic prompting strategies and comprehensive,\nmulti-dimensional evaluation frameworks.\n  In this paper, we present SynLLM, a modular framework for generating\nhigh-quality synthetic medical tabular data using 20 state-of-the-art\nopen-source LLMs, including LLaMA, Mistral, and GPT variants, guided by\nstructured prompts. We propose four distinct prompt types, ranging from\nexample-driven to rule-based constraints, that encode schema, metadata, and\ndomain knowledge to control generation without model fine-tuning. Our framework\nfeatures a comprehensive evaluation pipeline that rigorously assesses generated\ndata across statistical fidelity, clinical consistency, and privacy\npreservation.\n  We evaluate SynLLM across three public medical datasets, including Diabetes,\nCirrhosis, and Stroke, using 20 open-source LLMs. Our results show that prompt\nengineering significantly impacts data quality and privacy risk, with\nrule-based prompts achieving the best privacy-quality balance. SynLLM\nestablishes that, when guided by well-designed prompts and evaluated with\nrobust, multi-metric criteria, LLMs can generate synthetic medical data that is\nboth clinically plausible and privacy-aware, paving the way for safer and more\neffective data sharing in healthcare research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc288\ud37c\ubc14\uc774\uc800\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c

Mesh movement techniques address\nthis challenge by dynamically relocating mesh nodes to rapidly-varying regions,\nenhancing both simulation accuracy and computational efficiency. However,\ntraditional approaches suffer from high computational complexity and geometric\ninflexibility, limiting their applicability, and existing supervised\nlearning-based approaches face challenges in zero-shot generalization across\ndiverse PDEs and mesh topologies.In this paper, we present an Unsupervised and\nGeneralizable Mesh Movement Network (UGM2N).

It lifts the stringent assumption\nof the conventional Optimal Transport (OT) that input measures are of equal\nmasses, which is often not guaranteed in real-world datasets, and thus offers\ngreater flexibility by permitting transport between unbalanced input measures.\nNevertheless, existing major solvers for POT commonly rely on entropic\nregularization for acceleration and thus return dense transport plans,\nhindering the adoption of POT in various applications that favor sparsity. In\nthis paper, as an alternative approach to the entropic POT formulation in the\nliterature, we propose a novel formulation of POT with quadratic\nregularization, hence termed quadratic regularized POT (QPOT), which induces\nsparsity to the transport plan and consequently facilitates the adoption of POT\nin many applications with sparsity requirements. Extensive experiments on\nsynthetic and CIFAR-10 datasets, as well as real-world applications such as\ncolor transfer and domain adaptations, consistently demonstrate the improved\nsparsity and favorable performance of our proposed QPOT formulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ucd5c\uc801 \uc6b4\uc1a1 \uc774\ub860\uc758 \uac00\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc97\uc5b4\ub09c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c\uc11c, \uc774\ucc28 \uc815\uaddc\ud654\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \ubd80\ubd84 \ucd5c\uc801 \uc6b4\uc1a1(POT) \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 QPOT\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "POT\ub294 \uc785\ub825 \uce21\uc815\uc774 \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \uc9c8\ub7c9\uc744 \uac00\uc9c8 \uac83\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uac15\ud55c \uac00\uc815\uc744 \uc6b0\ud68c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc5b4 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uba38\uc2e0\ub7ec\ub2dd \uc751\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\uc6a9\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ubc00\uc9d1\ud55c \uc6b4\uc1a1 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \ud76c\uc18c\uc131\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \uc751\uc6a9\uc5d0 \uc801\ud569\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774\ucc28 \uc815\uaddc\ud654\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc6b4\uc1a1 \uacc4\ud68d\uc758 \ud76c\uc18c\uc131\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\ub294 QPOT\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 POT \uacf5\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubc0f CIFAR-10 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc138\ud2b8, \uc0c9\uc0c1 \uc804\uc1a1 \ubc0f \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc801\uc751\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc751\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c QPOT\uc758 \ud76c\uc18c\uc131 \ud5a5\uc0c1 \ubc0f \ud37c\ud3ec\uba3c\uc2a4\ub97c \uc785\uc99d\ud558\ub294 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "QPOT\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud76c\uc18c\uc131 \uc694\uad6c\uc0ac\ud56d\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0\uc11c POT\uc758 \ucc44\ud0dd\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc744 \uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubd80\ubd84 \ucd5c\uc801 \uc6b4\uc1a1(POT)\uc740 \ucd5c\uadfc \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uba38\uc2e0\ub7ec\ub2dd(ML) \uc751\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc2ec \ub3c4\uad6c\ub85c \ubd80\uc0c1\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.

However, while federated LLM frameworks effectively enable\ncollaborative training without raw data sharing, they critically lack built-in\nmechanisms for regulatory compliance like GDPR's right to be forgotten.\nIntegrating private data heightens concerns over data quality and long-term\ngovernance, yet existing distributed training frameworks offer no principled\nway to selectively remove specific client contributions post-training. Due to\ndistributed data silos, stringent privacy constraints, and the intricacies of\ninterdependent model aggregation, federated LLM unlearning is significantly\nmore complex than centralized LLM unlearning. To address this gap, we introduce\nOblivionis, a lightweight learning and unlearning framework that enables\nclients to selectively remove specific private data during federated LLM\ntraining, enhancing trustworthiness and regulatory compliance. By unifying FL\nand unlearning as a dual optimization objective, we incorporate 6 FL and 5\nunlearning algorithms for comprehensive evaluation and comparative analysis,\nestablishing a robust pipeline for federated LLM unlearning. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that Oblivionis outperforms local training, achieving a\nrobust balance between forgetting efficacy and model utility, with\ncross-algorithm comparisons providing clear directions for future LLM\ndevelopment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac1c\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc548\uc804\ud558\uac8c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uace0, \ud2b9\uc815 \uac1c\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc120\ud0dd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ad\uc81c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 Oblivionis \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc800\uc790\ub4e4\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uac1c\uc778\uc131 \uc720\uc9c0\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc0ad\uc81c\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uaddc\uc81c\ub97c \uc900\uc218\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ubd80\uc7ac\ub97c \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc0bc\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "Oblivionis\ub294 \uc5f0\ud569 LLM \ud6c8\ub828 \uc911 \ud2b9\uc815 \uac1c\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc120\ud0dd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ad\uc81c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ub7c9 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc0f \ube44\ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "Oblivionis\ub294 \ub85c\uceec \ud6c8\ub828\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \ub9dd\uac01 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc640 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc720\uc6a9\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ucda9\uc871\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 Oblivionis\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5f0\ud569 LLM \ube44\ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uba70, \ud5a5\ud6c4 LLM \uac1c\ubc1c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uba85\ud655\ud55c \ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc\ub97c \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uac1c\uc778\uc758 \uc791\uc5c5\ubcc4 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc5f0\ud569 LLM \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc6d0\uc2dc \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uacf5\uc720 \uc5c6\uc774 \ud611\ub825\uc801\uc778 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, GDPR\uc758 \uc78a\ud600\uc9c8 \uad8c\ub9ac\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uaddc\uc81c \uc900\uc218\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ub0b4\uc7a5 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774 \uacb0\uc5ec\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac1c\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uba74 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud488\uc9c8 \ubc0f \uc7a5\uae30\uc801\uc778 \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc6b0\ub824\uac00 \ucee4\uc9c0\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubd84\uc0b0 \ud6c8\ub828 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828 \ud6c4 \ud2b9\uc815 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uae30\uc5ec\ub97c \uc120\ud0dd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uac70\ud558\ub294 \uc6d0\uce59\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubd84\uc0b0\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc0ac\uc77c\ub85c, \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc \uc81c\uc57d \ubc0f \uc0c1\ud638 \uc758\uc874\uc801\uc778 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc9d1\ud569\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc5f0\ud569 LLM \ube44\ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uc911\uc2dd LLM \ube44\ud559\uc2b5\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud6e8\uc52c \ub354 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uc18c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\uac00 \uc5f0\ud569 LLM \ud6c8\ub828 \uc911 \ud2b9\uc815 \uac1c\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc120\ud0dd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uac70\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ub7c9 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc0f \ube44\ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Oblivionis\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Many methods employ ad-hoc heuristics to improve grounding\nperformance, motivating the need for a more formal and generalizable strategy.\nWe introduce the notion of diminution, defined as a selected subset of the\nHerbrand universe used to generate a reduced ground program before solving. We\ngive a formal definition of diminution, analyze its key properties, and study\nthe complexity of identifying it.

In recent years, researchers have made\nsignificant progress by developing advanced deep learning models for\nspatiotemporal prediction. However, most existing models are deterministic,\ni.e., predicting only the expected mean values without quantifying uncertainty,\nleading to potentially unreliable and inaccurate outcomes. While recent studies\nhave introduced probabilistic models to quantify uncertainty, they typically\nfocus on a single phenomenon (e.g., taxi, bike, crime, or traffic crashes),\nthereby neglecting the inherent correlations among heterogeneous urban\nphenomena. To address the research gap, we propose a novel Graph Neural Network\nwith Uncertainty Quantification, termed UQGNN for multivariate spatiotemporal\nprediction. UQGNN introduces two key innovations: (i) an Interaction-aware\nSpatiotemporal Embedding Module that integrates a multivariate diffusion graph\nconvolutional network and an interaction-aware temporal convolutional network\nto effectively capture complex spatial and temporal interaction patterns, and\n(ii) a multivariate probabilistic prediction module designed to estimate both\nexpected mean values and associated uncertainties. Extensive experiments on\nfour real-world multivariate spatiotemporal datasets from Shenzhen, New York\nCity, and Chicago demonstrate that UQGNN consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines in both prediction accuracy and uncertainty\nquantification.

Most existing system heterogeneous FL schemes utilize\nglobal pruning or ensemble distillation, yet they often overlook typical\nconstraints required for communication efficiency. Meanwhile, deep ensembles\ncan aggregate predictions from individually trained models to improve\nperformance, but current ensemble-based FL methods fall short in fully\ncapturing the diversity of model predictions. In this work, we propose SHEFL, a\nglobal ensemble-based federated learning framework suited for clients with\ndiverse computational capacities. We allocate different numbers of global\nmodels to clients based on their available resources. We further introduce a\nnovel aggregation scheme that accounts for bias between clients with different\ncomputational capabilities. To reduce the computational burden of training deep\nensembles and mitigate data bias, we dynamically adjust the resource ratio\nacross clients - aggressively reducing the influence of underpowered clients in\nconstrained scenarios, while increasing their weight in the opposite case.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively addresses\ncomputational heterogeneity,

The iterative hybrid mechanism\nintegrates the proposed Node-Destroyer Model, a machine learning hybrid model\nthat utilized Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) such identifies and selects customer\nnodes to guide the Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) operator within the\nmetaheuristic optimization frameworks. This model leverages the structural\nproperties of the problem and solution that can be represented as a graph, to\nguide strategic selections concerning node removal. The proposed approach\nreduces operational complexity and scales down the search space involved in the\noptimization process. The hybrid approach is applied specifically to the CVRP\nand does not require retraining across problem instances of different sizes.\nThe proposed hybrid mechanism is able to improve the performance of baseline\nmetaheuristic algorithms. Our approach not only enhances the solution quality\nfor standard CVRP benchmarks but also proves scalability on very large-scale\ninstances with up to 30,000 customer nodes.

This\npaper proposes a class of distributed optimization algorithms based on the\naugmented Lagrangian technique, designed to accommodate diverse communication\ntopologies in both centralized and decentralized FL settings. Furthermore, we\ndevelop multiple termination criteria and parameter update mechanisms to\nenhance computational efficiency, accompanied by rigorous theoretical\nguarantees of convergence.

However, enforcing a fixed low-rank structure caps the rank of\nthe weight matrices and can hinder the model's ability to learn complex\npatterns. Furthermore, the effective rank of the model's weights tends to\ndecline during training, and this drop is accelerated when the model is\nreparameterized into a low-rank structure. In this study, we argue that\nstrategically interleaving full-rank training epochs within low-rank training\nepochs can effectively restore the rank of the model's weights.

To address this, we introduce STELAR-Vision, a training framework\nfor topology-aware reasoning. At its core is TopoAug, a synthetic data pipeline\nthat enriches training with diverse topological structures. Using supervised\nfine-tuning and reinforcement learning, we post-train Qwen2VL models with both\naccuracy and efficiency in mind.

However, semantic classification\napplications in industry, like customer intent detection or semantic role\nlabeling, tend to be highly specialized. They require annotation by domain\nexperts in contrast to general-purpose corpora for pretraining. Further, they\ntypically require high inference throughputs which limits the model size from\nlatency and cost perspectives. Thus, for a range of specialized classification\ntasks, the preferred solution is to develop customized classifiers by\nfinetuning smaller language models (e.g., mini-encoders, small language\nmodels).\n  In this work, we develop a token-driven sparse finetuning strategy to adapt\nsmall language models to specialized classification tasks. We identify and\nfinetune a small sensitive subset of model parameters by leveraging\ntask-specific token constructs in the finetuning dataset, while leaving most of\nthe pretrained weights unchanged. Unlike adapter approaches such as low rank\nadaptation (LoRA), we do not introduce additional parameters to the model. Our\napproach identifies highly relevant semantic tokens (case study in the\nAppendix) and outperforms end-to-end finetuning, LoRA, layer selection, and\nprefix tuning on five diverse semantic classification tasks.

However, most existing agents' implementations are\nscenario-tailored, without a unified framework to guide the design. This lack\nof a general social agent limits their ability to generalize across different\nsocial contexts and to produce consistent, realistic behaviors. To address this\nchallenge, we propose a theory-informed framework that provides a systematic\ndesign process for LLM-based social agents. Our framework is grounded in\nprinciples from Social Cognition Theory and introduces three key modules:\nmotivation, action planning, and learning. These modules jointly enable agents\nto reason about their goals, plan coherent actions, and adapt their behavior\nover time, leading to more flexible and contextually appropriate responses.\nComprehensive experiments demonstrate that our theory-driven agents reproduce\nrealistic human behavior patterns under complex conditions, achieving up to 75%\nlower deviation from real-world behavioral data across multiple fidelity\nmetrics compared to classical generative baselines. Ablation studies further\nshow that removing motivation, planning, or learning modules increases errors\nby 1.5 to 3.2 times, confirming their distinct and essential contributions to\ngenerating realistic and coherent social behaviors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc774 \uc0ac\ud68c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758

Prior work\ntypically leverages in-context learning to iteratively guide the model towards\nbetter solutions. Such methods, however, often struggle to balance exploration\nof new solution spaces with exploitation of high-reward ones. Recently,\ntest-time training (TTT) with synthetic data has shown promise in improving\nsolution quality. However, the need for hand-crafted training data tailored to\neach task limits feasibility and scalability across domains. To address this\nproblem, we introduce MiGrATe-a method for online TTT that uses GRPO as a\nsearch algorithm to adapt LLMs at inference without requiring external training\ndata. MiGrATe operates via a mixed-policy group construction procedure that\ncombines on-policy sampling with two off-policy data selection techniques:\ngreedy sampling, which selects top-performing past completions, and\nneighborhood sampling (NS), which generates completions structurally similar to\nhigh-reward ones. Together, these components bias the policy gradient towards\nexploitation of promising regions in solution space, while preserving\nexploration through on-policy sampling. We evaluate MiGrATe on three\nchallenging domains-word search, molecule optimization, and hypothesis+program\ninduction on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC)-and find that it\nconsistently outperforms both inference-only and TTT baselines, demonstrating\nthe potential of online TTT as a solution for complex search tasks without\nexternal supervision.", "AI": {"tldr": "MiGrATe\ub294 \uc678\ubd80 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc5c6\uc774 LLM\uc744 \uc801\uc751\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 TTT \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM\uc744 \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud560 \ub54c \ud0d0\uc0c9\uacfc \ud65c\uc6a9\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "MiGrATe\ub294 GRPO\ub97c \uac80\uc0c9 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 TTT \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c, \ud63c\ud569 \uc815\ucc45 \uadf8\ub8f9 \uad6c\uc131 \uc808\ucc28\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 on-policy \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uacfc \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 off-policy \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc120\ud0dd \uae30\ubc95(\ud0d1 \uc131\uacfc \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \ubc0f NS)\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "MiGrATe\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b0\uc218\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc628\ub77c\uc778 TTT\ub294 \uc678\ubd80 \uac10\ub3c5 \uc5c6\uc774 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uac80\uc0c9 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8 \ud569\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd84\uc790 \uc124\uacc4\uc5d0 \uc774\ub974\uae30\uae4c\uc9c0 \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc774 \uc801\uc6a9\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\uc804 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc73c\ub85c \uc548\ub0b4\ud55c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158 \uacf5\uac04 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uacfc \ub192\uc740 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc758 \uae30\uc874 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158 \ud65c\uc6a9 \uac04\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\ub294\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc\uc5d0\ub294 \ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uac04 \ud6c8\ub828(TTT)\uc774 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uac01 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucd98 \uc218\uc81c \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc740 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uacfc \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 GRPO\ub97c \uac80\uc0c9 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 TTT \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 MiGrATe\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uba70, \uc678\ubd80 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc5c6\uc774 \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0\uc11c LLM\uc744 \uc801\uc751\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.

This integration has led to the\ndevelopment of AR agents to support intelligent, goal-directed interactions in\nreal-world environments. While current AR agents effectively support immediate\ntasks, they struggle with complex multi-step scenarios that require\nunderstanding and leveraging user's long-term experiences and preferences. This\nlimitation stems from their inability to capture, retain, and reason over\nhistorical user interactions in spatiotemporal contexts. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a conceptual framework for memory-augmented AR agents\nthat can provide personalized task assistance by learning from and adapting to\nuser-specific experiences over time. Our framework consists of four\ninterconnected modules: (1) Perception Module for multimodal sensor processing,\n(2) Memory Module for persistent spatiotemporal experience storage, (3)\nSpatiotemporal Reasoning Module for synthesizing past and present contexts, and\n(4) Actuator Module for effective AR communication. We further present an\nimplementation roadmap, a future evaluation strategy, a potential target\napplication and use cases to demonstrate the practical applicability of our\nframework across diverse domains.

However, these methods often overlook\ndecades of accumulated semantic and contextual knowledge. Recent advancements\nin large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable reasoning abilities and\nprior knowledge across scientific domains, leading us to hypothesize that LLMs\ncan generate rich molecular representations when guided to reason in multiple\nperspectives. To address these gaps, we propose $\\text{M}^{2}$LLM, a multi-view\nframework that integrates three perspectives: the molecular structure view, the\nmolecular task view, and the molecular rules view. These views are fused\ndynamically to adapt to task requirements, and experiments demonstrate that\n$\\text{M}^{2}$LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks\nacross classification and regression tasks.

Since retraining is\ncomputationally expensive, knowledge editing offers an efficient alternative --\nmodifying internal knowledge without full retraining. These methods aim to\nupdate facts precisely while preserving the model's overall capabilities. While\nexisting surveys focus on the mechanism of editing (e.g., parameter changes vs.\nexternal memory), they often overlook the function of the knowledge being\nedited. This survey introduces a novel, complementary function-based taxonomy\nto provide a more holistic view. We examine how different mechanisms apply to\nvarious knowledge types -- factual, temporal, conceptual, commonsense, and\nsocial -- highlighting how editing effectiveness depends on the nature of the\ntarget knowledge. By organizing our review along these two axes, we map the\ncurrent landscape, outline the strengths and limitations of existing methods,\ndefine the problem formally, survey evaluation tasks and datasets, and conclude\nwith open challenges and future directions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc9c0\uc2dd \ud3b8\uc9d1 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uae30\ub2a5 \uae30\ubc18 \ubd84\ub958\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc720\ud615\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud3b8\uc9d1 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uace0, \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \uac15\uc810\uacfc \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uc815\ub9ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ubc29\ub300\ud55c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ucf54\ud37c\uc2a4\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc2b5\ub4dd\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774 \uc815\ubcf4\uac00 \uad6c\uc2dd\uc774\uac70\ub098 \ubd80\uc815\ud655\ud574\uc9c8 \uc218 \uc788\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0, \uc804\uccb4 \uc7ac\ud6c8\ub828 \uc5c6\uc774 \ub0b4\ubd80 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc218\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 \uc9c0\uc2dd \ud3b8\uc9d1\uc774 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ub300\uc548\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uc2dc\ub41c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uae30\ub2a5 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubd84\ub958 \uccb4\uacc4\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc720\ud615(\uc0ac\uc2e4\uc801, \uc2dc\uac04\uc801, \uac1c\ub150\uc801, \uc0c1\uc2dd, \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801)\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ub2e4\ub978 \ud3b8\uc9d1 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774 \uc801\uc6a9\ub418\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud3b8\uc9d1\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc740 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc758 \uc131\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ub2ec\ub77c\uc9c4\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70, \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \uac15\uc810\uacfc \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uc815\ub9ac\ud558\uace0, \ud604\ud669\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ud3c9\uac00 \uc791\uc5c5\uacfc \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uace0, \uc5f4\ub9b0 \ub3c4\uc804\uacfc\uc81c\uc640 \ubbf8\ub798 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub17c\uc758\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \ubc29\ub300\ud55c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ucf54\ud37c\uc2a4\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ub300\ub7c9\uc758 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc2b5\ub4dd\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc774 \uc815\ubcf4\ub294 \uc624\ub798\ub418\uac70\ub098 \ubd80\uc815\ud655\ud574\uc9c8 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc7ac\ud6c8\ub828\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4e4\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0, \uc9c0\uc2dd \ud3b8\uc9d1\uc740 \uc804\uccb4 \uc7ac\ud6c8\ub828 \uc5c6\uc774 \ub0b4\ubd80 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc218\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ub300\uc548\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uc2dc\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc804\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uc5ed\ub7c9\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \uc0ac\uc2e4\uc744 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub9ac\ubdf0\ub4e4\uc740 \ud3b8\uc9d1\uc758 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998(\uc608: \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \ubcc0\ud654 \ub300 \uc678\ubd80 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac)\uc5d0 \uc911\uc810\uc744 \ub450\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud3b8\uc9d1\ub418\ub294 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc758 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \uac04\uacfc\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub9ac\ubdf0\ub294 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \uad00\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uae30\ub2a5 \uae30\ubc18 \ubd84\ub958 \uccb4\uacc4\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c Mechanisms\uc774 \uc0ac\uc2e4\uc801, \uc2dc\uac04\uc801, \uac1c\ub150\uc801, \uc0c1\uc2dd, \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc720\ud615\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc801\uc6a9\ub418\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uba70, \ud3b8\uc9d1 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc774 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc758 \uc131\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ub2ec\ub77c\uc9c4\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub450 \ucd95\uc744 \ub530\ub77c \ub9ac\ubdf0\ub97c \uc870\uc9c1\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368, \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uc9c0\ud615\ub3c4\ub97c \ub9e4\ud551\ud558\uace0, \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \uac15\uc810\uacfc \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uac1coutline\ud558\uace0, \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uacf5\uc2dd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\uc758\ud558\uba70, \ud3c9\uac00 \uc791\uc5c5\uacfc \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uace0, \uc5f4\ub9b0 \ub3c4\uc804\uacfc\uc81c\uc640 \ubbf8\ub798 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uacb0\ub860\uc744 \ub0b4\ub9bd\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, OCIL faces two key challenges: maintaining model stability\nunder strict memory constraints and ensuring adaptability to new tasks. Under\nstricter memory constraints, current replay-based methods are less effective.\nWhile ensemble methods improve adaptability (plasticity), they often struggle\nwith stability. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel approach that\nenhances ensemble learning through a Global Workspace Model (GWM)-a shared,\nimplicit memory that guides the learning of multiple student models. The GWM is\nformed by fusing the parameters of all students within each training batch,\ncapturing the historical learning trajectory and serving as a dynamic anchor\nfor knowledge consolidation. This fused model is then redistributed\nperiodically to the students to stabilize learning and promote cross-task\nconsistency. In addition, we introduce a multi-level collaborative distillation\nmechanism. This approach enforces peer-to-peer consistency among students and\npreserves historical knowledge by aligning each student with the GWM. As a\nresult, student models remain adaptable to new tasks while maintaining\npreviously learned knowledge, striking a better balance between stability and\nplasticity.

To bridge this gap, we propose\nE-Agent, an agent framework featuring two key innovations: a mRAG planner\ntrained to dynamically orchestrate multimodal tools based on contextual\nreasoning, and a task executor employing tool-aware execution sequencing to\nimplement optimized mRAG workflows. E-Agent adopts a one-time mRAG planning\nstrategy that enables efficient information retrieval while minimizing\nredundant tool invocations. To rigorously assess the planning capabilities of\nmRAG systems, we introduce the Real-World mRAG Planning (RemPlan) benchmark.\nThis novel benchmark contains both retrieval-dependent and\nretrieval-independent question types, systematically annotated with essential\nretrieval tools required for each instance. The benchmark's explicit mRAG\nplanning annotations and diverse question design enhance its practical\nrelevance by simulating real-world scenarios requiring dynamic mRAG decisions.\nExperiments across RemPlan and three established benchmarks demonstrate\nE-Agent's superiority: 13% accuracy gain over state-of-the-art mRAG methods\nwhile reducing redundant searches by 37%.", "AI": {"tldr": "E-Agent\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 mRAG \uacc4\ud68d\uc790\uc640 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub41c mRAG \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub97c \uad6c\ud604\ud558\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc2e4\ud589\uae30\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\uc131\uc744 \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uace0 \uc2e4\uc0dd\ud65c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 mRAG \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc99d\ub300\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(MLLM)\uc774 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\ub294\ub370 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "E-Agent\ub294 \uc0c1\ud669\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 mRAG \uacc4\ud68d\uc790\uc640 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc778\uc9c0\uc801\uc778 \uc2e4\ud589 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2f1\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub41c mRAG \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub97c \uad6c\ud604\ud558\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc2e4\ud589\uae30\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "E-Agent\ub294 \ucd5c\uc2e0 mRAG \ubc29\ubc95 \ub300\ube44 13% \uc815\ud655\ub3c4 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uacfc 37% \ubd88\ud544\uc694\ud55c \uac80\uc0c9\uc758 \uac10\uc18c\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "E-Agent\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc9c8\ubb38 \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub97c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c mRAG \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uacc4\ud68d \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc5c4\ubc00\ud558\uac8c \ud3c9\uac00\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub2e4\uc911\ubaa8\ub2ec \uac80\uc0c9 \uc99d\uac15 \uc0dd\uc131(mRAG)\uc740 \ub274\uc2a4 \ubd84\uc11d \ubc0f \ud2b8\ub80c\ub4dc \uc8fc\uc81c\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc911\ubaa8\ub2ec \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(MLLM)\uc758 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc73c\ub85c \ub5a0\uc624\ub974\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uacbd\uc9c1\ub41c \uac80\uc0c9 \uc804\ub7b5\uacfc \uc2dc\uac01 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc0c1\ud669\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc911\ubaa8\ub2ec \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 mRAG \uacc4\ud68d\uc790\uc640 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub41c mRAG \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub97c \uad6c\ud604\ud558\ub294 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc778\uc9c0\uc801\uc778 \uc2e4\ud589 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2f1\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc2e4\ud589\uae30\ub97c \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 E-Agent\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly common, AI's\nability to recognize and respond to human emotions is crucial for effective\nhuman-AI interactions. In particular, whether such systems can match or surpass\nhuman experts remains to be seen. However, the emotional intelligence of AI,\nparticularly multimodal large language models (MLLMs), remains largely\nunexplored. This study evaluates the emotion recognition abilities of MLLMs\nusing the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) and its multiracial\ncounterpart (MRMET), and compares their performance against human participants.\nResults show that, on average, MLLMs outperform humans in accurately\nidentifying emotions across both tests. This trend persists even when comparing\nperformance across low, medium, and expert-level performing groups. Yet when we\naggregate independent human decisions to simulate collective intelligence,\nhuman groups significantly surpass the performance of aggregated MLLM\npredictions, highlighting the wisdom of the crowd. Moreover, a collaborative\napproach (augmented intelligence) that combines human and MLLM predictions\nachieves greater accuracy than either humans or MLLMs alone.

Existing works either focus on flow-based models with\nstochastic samplers or establish complexity results that exhibit exponential\ndependence on problem parameters. In this work, under the realistic bounded\nsupport assumption, we prove the first polynomial discretization complexity for\nmulti-step and one-step RF-based models with a deterministic sampler\nsimultaneously. For the multi-step setting, inspired by the predictor-corrector\nframework of diffusion models, we introduce a Langevin process as a corrector\nand show that RF-based models can achieve better polynomial discretization\ncomplexity than diffusion models. To achieve this result, we conduct a detailed\nanalysis of the RF-based model and explain why it is better than previous\npopular models, such as variance preserving (VP) and variance exploding\n(VE)-based models. Based on the observation of multi-step RF-based models, we\nfurther provide the first polynomial discretization complexity result for\none-step RF-based models, improving upon prior results for one-step\ndiffusion-based models. These findings mark the first step toward theoretically\nunderstanding the impressive empirical performance of RF-based models in both\nmulti-step and one-step generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8

While\nthis design eases coordination, we hypothesize that it imposes cognitive load\ninterference, as the agent must interleave long-horizon reasoning with precise\nprogram synthesis. We validate this hypothesis through a controlled comparison\nbetween a reasoning-only agent and a reasoning-plus-code agent, finding that\nthe latter produces significantly fewer correct reasoning paths despite having\ntool-calling capabilities. To address this, we propose a dual-agent hybrid\nframework: a Reasoning Agent performs stepwise problem decomposition, and a\nCode Agent handles code generation and execution. Training combines imitation\nlearning and reinforcement learning: the Code Agent receives strong rewards for\nmatching intermediate ground-truth programs and weaker rewards for valid\nexecution, while the Reasoning Agent is optimized chiefly via final-answer\naccuracy using advantage estimation to credit intermediate steps.

Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) leverages reward\nmodels (RMs) as proxies for human preferences to align LLM behaviors with human\nvalues, making the accuracy, reliability, and interpretability of RMs critical\nfor effective alignment. However, traditional RMs lack interpretability, offer\nlimited insight into the reasoning behind reward assignments, and are\ninflexible toward user preference shifts. While recent multidimensional RMs aim\nfor improved interpretability, they often fail to provide feature-level\nattribution and require costly annotations. To overcome these limitations, we\nintroduce the Sparse Autoencoder-enhanced Reward Model (\\textbf{SARM}), a novel\narchitecture that integrates a pretrained Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) into a\nreward model. SARM maps the hidden activations of LLM-based RM into an\ninterpretable, sparse, and monosemantic feature space, from which a scalar head\naggregates feature activations to produce transparent and conceptually\nmeaningful reward scores.

However,\nobtaining such factors is challenging in practice: additional and valid\ninformation sources are inherently scarce, and even when such sources are\navailable, their independence from the original source cannot be guaranteed. To\naddress this challenge, In this paper we propose a Differentiated Factor\nConsistency Semi-supervised Framework (DiFac), which derives differentiated\nfactors from a single information source and enforces their consistency. During\npre-training, the model learns to extract these factors; in training, it\niteratively removes samples with conflicting factors and ranks pseudo-labels\nbased on the shortest stave principle, selecting the top candidate samples to\nreduce overconfidence commonly observed in confidence-based or ensemble-based\nmethods.

To address these\nresearch gaps, we design a three-stage experiment based on economic\nquestionnaires. We propose a more general and precise evaluation framework to\nmodel LLMs' decision-making behaviour under PT, introducing uncertainty through\nthe empirical probability values associated with commonly used epistemic\nmarkers in comparable contexts. We then incorporate epistemic markers into the\nevaluation framework based on their corresponding probability values to examine\ntheir influence on LLM decision-making behaviours. Our findings suggest that\nmodelling LLMs' decision-making with PT is not consistently reliable,\nparticularly when uncertainty is expressed in diverse linguistic forms.

IEEE 21st India Council International Conference\n  (INDICON), 2024", "summary": "In a telecommunications network, fault alarms generated by network nodes are\nmonitored in a Network Operations Centre (NOC) to ensure network availability\nand continuous network operations. The monitoring process comprises of tasks\nsuch as active alarms analysis, root alarm identification, and resolution of\nthe underlying problem. Each network node potentially can generate alarms of\ndifferent types, while nodes can be from multiple vendors, a network can have\nhundreds of nodes thus resulting in an enormous volume of alarms at any time.\nSince network nodes are inter-connected, a single fault in the network would\ntrigger multiple sequences of alarms across a variety of nodes and from a\nmonitoring point of view, it is a challenging task for a NOC engineer to be\naware of relations between the various alarms, when trying to identify, for\nexample, a root alarm on which an action needs to be taken. To effectively\nidentify root alarms, it is essential to learn relation among the alarms for\naccurate and faster resolution. In this work we propose a novel unsupervised\nalarm relation learning technique Temporal Optimization (TempOpt) that is\npractical and overcomes the limitations of an existing class of alarm\nrelational learning method-temporal dependency methods.

However, conventional Transformer models\nare often hindered by their large number of parameters and their limited\nability to capture non-stationary features in data through smoothing.\nSimilarly, MLP models struggle to manage multi-channel dependencies\neffectively. To address these limitations, we propose a novel, lightweight time\nseries prediction model, WaveTS-B. This model combines wavelet transforms with\nMLP to capture both periodic and non-stationary characteristics of data in the\nwavelet domain.

Traditional methods for mitigating bias often rely on data\nfiltering or post-hoc output moderation, which treat the model as an opaque\nblack box. In this work, we introduce a complete, end-to-end system that uses\ntechniques from mechanistic interpretability to both identify and actively\nmitigate bias directly within a model's internal workings. Our method involves\ntwo primary stages. First, we train linear \"probes\" on the internal activations\nof a model to detect the latent representations of various biases (e.g.,\ngender, race, age). Our experiments on \\texttt{gpt2-large} demonstrate that\nthese probes can identify biased content with near-perfect accuracy, revealing\nthat bias representations become most salient in the model's later layers.\nSecond, we leverage these findings to compute \"steering vectors\" by contrasting\nthe model's activation patterns for biased and neutral statements. By adding\nthese vectors during inference, we can actively steer the model's generative\nprocess away from producing harmful, stereotypical, or biased content in\nreal-time. We demonstrate the efficacy of this activation steering technique,\nshowing that it successfully alters biased completions toward more neutral\nalternatives.

However, its application is often constrained\nby the need for large datasets of existing designs and the lack of\ninterpretability about what features drive optimality. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce a systematic framework for constructing training\ndatasets tailored to generative models and demonstrate how these models can be\nleveraged for interpretable design. The novelty of this work is twofold: (i) we\npresent a systematic framework for generating archetypes with internally\nhomogeneous but mutually heterogeneous inputs that can be used to generate a\ntraining dataset, and (ii) we show how integrating generative models with\nBayesian optimization can enhance the interpretability of the latent space of\nadmissible designs. These findings are validated by using the framework to\ndesign a flow battery manifold, demonstrating that it effectively captures the\nspace of feasible designs, including novel configurations while enabling\nefficient exploration.

While most existing\nresearch focuses on post-request waiting time prediction with knowing the\nmatched driver information, pre-request waiting time prediction (i.e., before\nsubmitting a ride request and without matching a driver) is also important, as\nit enables passengers to plan their trips more effectively and enhance the\nexperience of both passengers and drivers. However, it has not been fully\nstudied by existing works. In this paper, we take the first step toward\nunderstanding the predictability and explainability of pre-request passenger\nwaiting time in ridesharing systems. Particularly, we conduct an in-depth\ndata-driven study to investigate the impact of demand&supply dynamics on\npassenger waiting time. Based on this analysis and feature engineering, we\npropose FiXGBoost, a novel feature interaction-based XGBoost model designed to\npredict waiting time without knowing the assigned driver information. We\nfurther perform an importance analysis to quantify the contribution of each\nfactor.

Continuous Variable Current Modulation\n(CVCM) is one such technology. Like any field-deployed, safety-critical asset,\nit can fail, triggering cascading disruptions. Many failures originate as\nsubtle anomalies that evolve over time, often not visually apparent in\nmonitored signals. Conventional approaches, which rely on clear signal changes,\nstruggle to detect them early. Early identification of failure types is\nessential to improve maintenance planning, minimising downtime and revenue\nloss. Leveraging deep neural networks, we propose a predictive maintenance\nframework that classifies anomalies well before they escalate into failures.\nValidated on 10 CVCM failure cases across different installations, the method\nis ISO-17359 compliant and outperforms conventional techniques, achieving\n99.31% overall accuracy with detection within 1% of anomaly onset. Through\nconformal prediction, we provide uncertainty estimates, reaching 99% confidence\nwith consistent coverage across classes.

This work explores the usage of genetic algorithms\nfor identifying these strong lottery ticket subnetworks.

However, retrieval and multimodal fusion obscure content provenance,\nrendering existing membership inference methods unable to reliably attribute\ngenerated outputs to pre-training, external retrieval, or user input, thus\nundermining privacy leakage accountability\n  To address these challenges, we propose the first Source-aware Membership\nAudit (SMA) that enables fine-grained source attribution of generated content\nin a semi-black-box setting with retrieval control capabilities.To address the\nenvironmental constraints of semi-black-box auditing, we further design an\nattribution estimation mechanism based on zero-order optimization, which\nrobustly approximates the true influence of input tokens on the output through\nlarge-scale perturbation sampling and ridge regression modeling. In addition,\nSMA introduces a cross-modal attribution technique that projects image inputs\ninto textual descriptions via MLLMs, enabling token-level attribution in the\ntext modality, which for the first time facilitates membership inference on\nimage retrieval traces in MRAG systems.

We address this task through optimization techniques that explore\nhow trainable activations can accommodate higher-complexity priors and match\nintricate target function distributions. We investigate flexible activation\nmodels, including Pade functions and piecewise linear functions, and discuss\nthe learning challenges related to identifiability, loss construction, and\nsymmetries.

As\ntheir commercial potential grows, critical details of the most capable CUA\nsystems remain closed. As these agents will increasingly mediate digital\ninteractions and execute consequential decisions on our behalf, the research\ncommunity needs access to open CUA frameworks to study their capabilities,\nlimitations, and risks. To bridge this gap, we propose OpenCUA, a comprehensive\nopen-source framework for scaling CUA data and foundation models. Our framework\nconsists of: (1) an annotation infrastructure that seamlessly captures human\ncomputer-use demonstrations; (2) AgentNet, the first large-scale computer-use\ntask dataset spanning 3 operating systems and 200+ applications and websites;\n(3) a scalable pipeline that transforms demonstrations into state-action pairs\nwith reflective long Chain-of-Thought reasoning that sustain robust performance\ngains as data scales. Our end-to-end agent models demonstrate strong\nperformance across CUA benchmarks.

However, these methods remain underutilized by the broader\nmachine learning community, in part because current empirical evaluations do\nnot permit assessment of their reliability and robustness, undermining their\npractical utility. Specifically, one of the principal criticisms made by the\ncommunity is the extensive use of synthetic experiments. We argue, on the\ncontrary, that synthetic experiments are essential and necessary to precisely\nassess and understand the capabilities of causal machine learning methods. To\nsubstantiate our position, we critically review the current evaluation\npractices, spotlight their shortcomings, and propose a set of principles for\nconducting rigorous empirical analyses with synthetic data.

Recently, converting time series data into the frequency domain\nfor forecasting has become popular for accurately exploring periodic patterns.\nHowever, existing methods often cannot effectively explore stationary\ninformation from complex intertwined frequency components. In this paper, we\npropose a simple yet effective Amplitude-Phase Reconstruct Network (APRNet)\nthat models the inter-relationships of amplitude and phase, which prevents the\namplitude and phase from being constrained by different physical quantities,\nthereby decoupling the distinct characteristics of signals for capturing\nstationary information. Specifically, we represent the multivariate time series\ninput across sequence and channel dimensions, highlighting the correlation\nbetween amplitude and phase at multiple interaction frequencies. We propose a\nnovel Kolmogorov-Arnold-Network-based Local Correlation (KLC) module to\nadaptively fit local functions using univariate functions, enabling more\nflexible characterization of stationary features across different amplitudes\nand phases. This significantly enhances the model's capability to capture\ntime-varying patterns.

However, the vulnerability of the models\nagainst adversarial attacks during this process has not been investigated\nsufficiently. In this paper, we present the first exploration of vulnerability\nto stage-transferred attacks, i.e., an adversarial example generated using the\nmodel in an earlier stage is used to attack the model in a later stage.

However, a key limitation of deep learning models is their\nsusceptibility to adversarial attacks, which has not been studied enough in the\ncontext of time series prediction. In contrast to areas such as computer\nvision, where adversarial robustness has been extensively studied, frequency\ndomain features of time series data play an important role in the prediction\ntask but have not been sufficiently explored in terms of adversarial attacks.\nThis paper proposes a time series prediction attack algorithm based on\nfrequency domain loss.

HI aims to reduce\nlatency, improve accuracy, and lower bandwidth usage by first using the\nLocal-ML model for inference and offloading to the Remote-ML only when the\nlocal inference is likely incorrect. A critical challenge in HI is estimating\nthe likelihood of the local inference being incorrect, especially when data\ndistributions and offloading costs change over time -- a problem we term\nHierarchical Inference Learning (HIL). We introduce a novel approach to HIL by\nmodeling the probability of correct inference by the Local-ML as an increasing\nfunction of the model's confidence measure, a structure motivated by empirical\nobservations but previously unexploited. We propose two policies, HI-LCB and\nHI-LCB-lite, based on the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) framework.

The state-of-the-art for predicting missing links in the\nhard case of a network without node attributes uses model stacking or neural\nnetwork techniques. It remains unknown which approach is best, and whether or\nhow the best choice of algorithm depends on the input network's\ncharacteristics. We answer these questions systematically using a large,\nstructurally diverse benchmark of 550 real-world networks under two standard\naccuracy measures (AUC and Top-k), comparing four stacking algorithms with 42\ntopological link predictors, two of which we introduce here, and two graph\nneural network algorithms. We show that no algorithm is best across all input\nnetworks, all algorithms perform well on most social networks, and few perform\nwell on economic and biological networks. Overall, model stacking with a random\nforest is both highly scalable and surpasses on AUC or is competitive with\ngraph neural networks on Top-k accuracy. But, algorithm performance depends\nstrongly on network characteristics like the degree distribution, triangle\ndensity, and degree assortativity. We introduce a meta-learning algorithm that\nexploits this variability to optimize link predictions for individual networks\nby selecting the best algorithm to apply, which we show outperforms all\nstate-of-the-art algorithms and scales to large networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 550\uac1c\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c

However, its significant computational costs have previously\nundermined its use for large models. We show how it can be successfully scaled\nup to the evaluation of large language models (LLMs). In particular we show\nthat the surrogate model used to guide data acquisition can be constructed\ncheaply using in-context learning, does not require updating within an\nactive-testing loop, and can be smaller than the target model. We even find we\ncan make good data-acquisition decisions without computing predictions with the\ntarget model and further introduce a single-run error estimator to asses how\nwell active testing is working on the fly.

Chi-Geometry generates\nsynthetic graph samples with (i) user-specified geometric and topological\ntraits to isolate certain types of samples and (ii) randomized node positions\nand species to minimize extraneous correlations. Each generated graph contains\nexactly one chiral center labeled either R or S, while all other nodes are\nlabeled N/A (non-chiral). The generated samples are then combined into a\ncohesive dataset that can be used to assess a GNN's ability to predict\nchirality as a node classification task. Chi-Geometry allows more interpretable\nand less confounding benchmarking of GNNs for prediction of chirality in the\ngraph samples which can guide the design of new GNN architectures with improved\npredictive performance. We illustrate Chi-Geometry's efficacy by using it to\ngenerate synthetic datasets for benchmarking various state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nGNN architectures. The conclusions of these benchmarking results guided our\ndesign of two new GNN architectures. The first GNN architecture established\nall-to-all connections in the graph to accurately predict chirality across all\nchallenging configurations where previously tested SOTA models failed, but at a\ncomputational cost (both for training and inference) that grows quadratically\nwith the number of graph nodes.

A recent line of work mitigates this by using\nsymbolic solvers: the model directly generates a formal program that a geometry\nsolver can execute. However, this direct program generation lacks intermediate\nreasoning, making the decision process opaque and prone to errors. In this\nwork, we explore a new approach that integrates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) with\nformal language. The model interleaves natural language reasoning with\nincremental emission of solver-executable code, producing a hybrid reasoning\ntrace in which critical derivations are expressed in formal language. To teach\nthis behavior at scale, we combine (1) supervised fine-tuning on an 11K newly\ndeveloped synthetic dataset with interleaved natural language reasoning and\nautomatic formalization, and (2) solver-in-the-loop reinforcement learning that\njointly optimizes both the CoT narrative and the resulting program through\noutcome-based rewards. Built on Qwen2.5-VL-7B, our new model, named\nGF-Reasoner, achieves up to 15% accuracy improvements on standard GPS\nbenchmarks, surpassing both 7B-scale peers and the much larger model\nQwen2.5-VL-72B. By exploiting high-order geometric knowledge and offloading\nsymbolic computation to the solver, the generated reasoning traces are\nnoticeably shorter and cleaner.

Despite this success, they often suffer from poor calibration,\nespecially in safety-critical scenarios such as autonomous driving and\nhealthcare, where unreliable confidence estimates can lead to serious\nconsequences. Recent studies have focused on improving calibration by modifying\nthe classifier, yet such efforts remain limited. Moreover, most existing\napproaches overlook calibration errors caused by underconfidence, which can be\nequally detrimental. To address these challenges, we propose MaC-Cal, a novel\nmask-based classifier calibration method that leverages stochastic sparsity to\nenhance the alignment between confidence and accuracy. MaC-Cal adopts a\ntwo-stage training scheme with adaptive sparsity, dynamically adjusting mask\nretention rates based on the deviation between confidence and accuracy.\nExtensive experiments show that MaC-Cal achieves superior calibration\nperformance and robustness under data corruption, offering a practical and\neffective solution for reliable confidence estimation in DNNs.", "AI": {"tldr": "DNN\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub3c4 \uc608\uce21 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubcf4\uc815 \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 MaC-Cal\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "DNN\uc774 \uc790\uc728 \uc8fc\ud589 \ubc0f \uc758\ub8cc\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc548\uc804-critical \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub3c4\uac00 \ub0ae\uc740 \ucd94\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub9c8\uc2a4\ud06c \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubd84\ub958\uae30 \ubcf4\uc815 \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 MaC-Cal\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ubb34\uc791\uc704 \ud76c\uc18c\uc131\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub3c4\uc640 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4 \uac04\uc758 \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.
