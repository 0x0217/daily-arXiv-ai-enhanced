To improve robustness and solution quality, recent approaches deploy multiple agent teams running in parallel to explore diverse reasoning trajectories. However, parallel execution comes at a significant computational cost: when different teams independently reason about similar sub-problems or execute analogous steps, they repeatedly perform substantial overlapping computation. To address these limitations, in this paper, we propose Learning to Share (LTS), a learned shared-memory mechanism for parallel agentic frameworks that enables selective cross-team information reuse while controlling context growth. LTS introduces a global memory bank accessible to all teams and a lightweight controller that decides whether intermediate agent steps should be added to memory or not. The controller is trained using stepwise reinforcement learning with usage-aware credit assignment, allowing it to identify information that is globally useful across parallel executions. Experiments on the AssistantBench and GAIA benchmarks show that LTS significantly reduces overall runtime while matching or improving task performance compared to memory-free parallel baselines, demonstrating that learned memory admission is an effective strategy for improving the efficiency of parallel agentic systems.

Despite strong results in open-domain settings, existing agentic search frameworks commonly treat long documents as flat collections of chunks, underutilizing document-native priors such as hierarchical organization and sequential discourse structure. We introduce DeepRead, a structure-aware, multi-turn document reasoning agent that explicitly operationalizes these priors for long-document question answering. DeepRead leverages LLM-based OCR model to convert PDFs into structured Markdown that preserves headings and paragraph boundaries. It then indexes documents at the paragraph level and assigns each paragraph a coordinate-style metadata key encoding its section identity and in-section order. Building on this representation, DeepRead equips the LLM with two complementary tools: a Retrieve tool that localizes relevant paragraphs while exposing their structural coordinates (with lightweight scanning context), and a ReadSection tool that enables contiguous, order-preserving reading within a specified section and paragraph range. Our experiments demonstrate that DeepRead achieves significant improvements over Search-o1-style agentic search in document question answering. The synergistic effect between retrieval and reading tools is also validated.

While large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced dialogue capabilities, most current systems still rely on cascaded architectures that connect independent modules. These pipelines are often plagued by accumulated errors, high latency, and poor real-time performance. Lacking access to the underlying conversational context, these pipelines inherently prioritize rigid lip-sync over emotional depth. To address these challenges, we propose A$^2$-LLM, an end-to-end conversational audio avatar large language model that jointly reasons about language, audio prosody, and 3D facial motion within a unified framework. To facilitate training, we introduce FLAME-QA, a high-quality multimodal dataset designed to align semantic intent with expressive facial dynamics within a QA format. By leveraging deep semantic understanding, A$^2$-LLM generates emotionally rich facial movements beyond simple lip-synchronization. Experimental results demonstrate that our system achieves superior emotional expressiveness while maintaining real-time efficiency (500 ms latency, 0.7 RTF).", "AI": {"tldr": "A$^2$-LLM\uc740 \ub300\ud654\uc758 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud558\uc5ec \uc5b8\uc5b4, \uc624\ub514\uc624, 3D \uc5bc\uad74 \uc6c0\uc9c1\uc784\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \uc74c\uc131 \uc544\ubc14\ud0c0 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c, \uac10\uc815 \ud45c\ud604\ub825\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uc74c \uc138\ub300 \uc778\uac04-\ucef4\ud4e8\ud130 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc758 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ubd80\ubd84\uc740 \ud45c\ud604\ub825 \uc788\uace0 \ubc18\uc751\uc774 \ube60\ub978 \ub300\ud654\ud615 \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uc778\uac04\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "A$^2$-LLM\uc740 \uc5b8\uc5b4, \uc624\ub514\uc624 \ud504\ub85c\uc18c\ub514, 3D \uc5bc\uad74 \uc6b4\ub3d9\uc744 \uacf5\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \uc885\ub2e8 \uac04 \ub300\ud654 \uc74c\uc131 \uc544\ubc14\ud0c0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

Current defenses rely on monitoring protocols that jointly evaluate an agent's Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and tool-use actions to ensure alignment with user intent. We demonstrate that these monitoring-based defenses can be bypassed via a novel Agent-as-a-Proxy attack, where prompt injection attacks treat the agent as a delivery mechanism, bypassing both agent and monitor simultaneously. While prior work on scalable oversight has focused on whether small monitors can supervise large agents, we show that even frontier-scale monitors are vulnerable. Large-scale monitoring models like Qwen2.5-72B can be bypassed by agents with similar capabilities, such as GPT-4o mini and Llama-3.1-70B.

However, transferring capabilities learned with PI to policies that must act without it at inference time remains a fundamental challenge. We study this problem in the context of distilling frontier models for multi-turn agentic environments, where closed-source systems typically hide their internal reasoning and expose only action trajectories. This breaks standard distillation pipelines, since successful behavior is observable but the reasoning process is not. For this, we introduce \u03c0-Distill, a joint teacher-student objective that trains a PI-conditioned teacher and an unconditioned student simultaneously using the same model. Additionally, we also introduce On-Policy Self-Distillation (OPSD), an alternative approach that trains using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a reverse KL-penalty between the student and the PI-conditioned teacher. We show that both of these algorithms effectively distill frontier agents using action-only PI. Specifically we find that \u03c0-Distill and in some cases OPSD, outperform industry standard practices (Supervised finetuning followed by RL) that assume access to full Chain-of-Thought supervision across multiple agentic benchmarks, models, and forms of PI.

This study presents a reinforcement learning (RL) based framework to enhance adaptive collision avoidance in ADR missions, specifically for multi-debris removal using small satellites. Small satellites are increasingly adopted due to their flexibility, cost effectiveness, and maneuverability, making them well suited for dynamic missions such as ADR.\n  Building on existing work in multi-debris rendezvous, the framework integrates refueling strategies, efficient mission planning, and adaptive collision avoidance to optimize spacecraft rendezvous operations. The proposed approach employs a masked Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, enabling the RL agent to dynamically adjust maneuvers in response to real-time orbital conditions. Key considerations include fuel efficiency, avoidance of active collision zones, and optimization of dynamic orbital parameters.\n  The RL agent learns to determine efficient sequences for rendezvousing with multiple debris targets, optimizing fuel usage and mission time while incorporating necessary refueling stops. Simulated ADR scenarios derived from the Iridium 33 debris dataset are used for evaluation, covering diverse orbital configurations and debris distributions to demonstrate robustness and adaptability.

Most existing agent defense mechanisms adopt a mandatory checking paradigm, in which security validation is forcibly triggered at predefined stages of the agent lifecycle. In this work, we argue that effective agent security should be intrinsic and selective rather than architecturally decoupled and mandatory. We propose Spider-Sense framework, an event-driven defense framework based on Intrinsic Risk Sensing (IRS), which allows agents to maintain latent vigilance and trigger defenses only upon risk perception. Once triggered, the Spider-Sense invokes a hierarchical defence mechanism that trades off efficiency and precision: it resolves known patterns via lightweight similarity matching while escalating ambiguous cases to deep internal reasoning, thereby eliminating reliance on external models. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce S$^2$Bench, a lifecycle-aware benchmark featuring realistic tool execution and multi-stage attacks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Spider-Sense achieves competitive or superior defense performance, attaining the lowest Attack Success Rate (ASR) and False Positive Rate (FPR), with only a marginal latency overhead of 8.3\\%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc774 \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \uc9c4\ud654\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubcf4\uc548 \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, Spider-Sense\ub77c\ub294 \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\uc5b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc704\ud5d8 \uc778\uc2dd \uc2dc\uc5d0\ub9cc \ubc29\uc5b4\ub97c \ud2b8\ub9ac\uac70\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud655\uc0b0\uacfc \ud568\uaed8 \ub098\ud0c0\ub098\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubcf4\uc548 \ub3c4\uc804\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud568.", "method": "Intrinsic Risk Sensing(IRS)\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8 \uc911\uc2ec \ubc29\uc5b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Spider-Sense\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud568.", "result": "Spider-Sense\ub294 \ub0ae\uc740 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc131\uacf5\ub960(ASR)\uacfc \uac70\uc9d3 \uae0d\uc815\ub960(FPR)\uc744 \uae30\ub85d\ud558\uba70 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc790\ub791\ud568.", "conclusion": "Spider-Sense\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc815\ubc00\ub3c4\ub97c \uc870\uc808\ud558\ub294 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc678\ubd80 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uac70\ud568.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc774 \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \uc9c4\ud654\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc774\ub4e4\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \ud06c\uac8c \ud655\ub300\ub418\uc5c8\uace0, \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubcf4\uc548 \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc758 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc0dd\uc560 \uc8fc\uae30\uc758 \ubbf8\ub9ac \uc815\uc758\ub41c \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\uc81c\ub85c \ubcf4\uc548 \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \ud2b8\ub9ac\uac70\ud558\ub294 \uc758\ubb34\uc801 \uac80\uc0ac \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \ucc44\ud0dd\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubcf4\uc548\uc774 \uad6c\uc870\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ub9ac\ub418\uace0 \uc758\ubb34\uc801\uc774\uc5b4\uc11c\ub294 \uc548 \ub418\uba70, \ub0b4\uc7ac\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc120\ud0dd\uc801\uc774\uc5b4\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub0b4\ubd80 \uc704\ud5d8 \uac10\uc9c0(Intrinsic Risk Sensing, IRS)\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8 \uc911\uc2ec \ubc29\uc5b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Spider-Sense\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801\uc778 \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \uc704\ud5d8 \uc778\uc2dd \uc2dc\uc5d0\ub9cc \ubc29\uc5b4\ub97c \ud2b8\ub9ac\uac70\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4. \ubc29\uc5b4\uac00 \ud2b8\ub9ac\uac70\ub418\uba74 Spider-Sense\ub294 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc815\ubc00\ub3c4\ub97c \uac70\ub798\ud558\ub294 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud638\ucd9c\ud558\uba70, \uacbd\ub7c9 \uc720\uc0ac\ub3c4 \ub9e4\uce6d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc54c\ub824\uc9c4 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0 \uc560\ub9e4\ud55c \uacbd\uc6b0\ub294 \uae4a\uc740 \ub0b4\ubd80 \ucd94\ub860\uc73c\ub85c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uba70 \uc678\ubd80 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uac70\ud55c\ub2e4. \ucca0\uc800\ud55c \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \ub3d5\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc2e4\ud589 \ubc0f \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \uc0dd\uc560 \uc8fc\uae30 \uc778\uc2dd \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc778 S$^2$Bench\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 Spider-Sense\ub294 \ub0ae\uc740 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc131\uacf5\ub960(ASR) \ubc0f \uac70\uc9d3 \uae0d\uc815\ub960(FPR)\uc744 \uae30\ub85d\ud558\uba70, 8.3\\%\uc758 \uacbd\ubbf8\ud55c \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub85c \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \ub610\ub294 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \ubc29\uc5b4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud568\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4."}}

Despite the promise related to availability and scale, the single most pressing question in AI for mental health is whether these tools are safe. The Validation of Ethical and Responsible AI in Mental Health (VERA-MH) evaluation was recently proposed to meet the urgent need for an evidence-based automated safety benchmark. This study aimed to examine the clinical validity and reliability of the VERA-MH evaluation for AI safety in suicide risk detection and response. We first simulated a large set of conversations between large language model (LLM)-based users (user-agents) and general-purpose AI chatbots. Licensed mental health clinicians used a rubric (scoring guide) to independently rate the simulated conversations for safe and unsafe chatbot behaviors, as well as user-agent realism. An LLM-based judge used the same scoring rubric to evaluate the same set of simulated conversations. We then compared rating alignment across (a) individual clinicians and (b) clinician consensus and the LLM judge, and (c) examined clinicians' ratings of user-agent realism. Individual clinicians were generally consistent with one another in their safety ratings (chance-corrected inter-rater reliability [IRR]: 0.77), thus establishing a gold-standard clinical reference. The LLM judge was strongly aligned with this clinical consensus (IRR: 0.81) overall and within key conditions. Clinician raters generally perceived the user-agents to be realistic. For the potential mental health benefits of AI chatbots to be realized, attention to safety is paramount. Findings from this human evaluation study support the clinical validity and reliability of VERA-MH: an open-source, fully automated AI safety evaluation for mental health. Further research will address VERA-MH generalizability and robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI \ucc57\ubd07\uc758 \uc2ec\ub9ac\uc801 \uc9c0\uc6d0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\ub85c, VERA-MH \ud3c9\uac00\uac00 \uc784\uc0c1\uc801 \uc720\ud6a8\uc131\uacfc \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AI \ucc57\ubd07\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc740 \uc815\uc2e0 \uac74\uac15 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uac00\uc7a5 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\uc774\uba70, \uc774\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc99d\uac70 \uae30\ubc18 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uc548\uc804 \uae30\uc900\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc640 \uc77c\ubc18 \ubaa9\uc801 AI \ucc57\ubd07 \uac04\uc758 \ub300\ud654\ub97c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud558\uc5ec \uc0c1\ub2f4\uc790\ub4e4\uc774 \uc548\uc804 \ubc0f \ube44\uc548\uc804 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\uac1c\ubcc4 \uc0c1\ub2f4\uc790\ub4e4 \uac04\uc758 \uc548\uc804 \ud3c9\uac00 \uc77c\uce58\ub294 0.77\ub85c \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uc5c8\uace0, LLM \ud310\uc0ac\ub294 \uc0c1\ub2f4\uc790\ub4e4\uc758 \ud569\uc758\uc640 \uac15\ud558\uac8c \uc77c\uce58\ud558\uc600\ub2e4(0.81).", "conclusion": "AI \ucc57\ubd07\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \uc815\uc2e0 \uac74\uac15 \uc774\uc775\uc744 \uc2e4\ud604\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc8fc\uc758\uac00 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud604\uc7ac \uc218\ubc31\ub9cc \uba85\uc774 \uc2ec\ub9ac\uc801 \uc9c0\uc6d0\uc744 \uc704\ud574 AI \ucc57\ubd07\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc811\uadfc\uc131\uacfc \uaddc\ubaa8\uc640 \uad00\ub828\ub41c \uc57d\uc18d\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \uc815\uc2e0 \uac74\uac15\uc744 \uc704\ud55c AI\uc5d0\uc11c \uac00\uc7a5 \uc2dc\uae09\ud55c \uc9c8\ubb38\uc740 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c\ub4e4\uc774 \uc548\uc804\ud55c\uc9c0 \uc5ec\ubd80\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc VERA-MH \ud3c9\uac00\ub294 \uc99d\uac70 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uc548\uc804 \uae30\uc900\uc758 \uae34\uae09\ud55c \ud544\uc694\ub97c \ucda9\uc871\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc81c\uc548\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc790\uc0b4 \uc704\ud5d8 \uac10\uc9c0 \ubc0f \ub300\uc751\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c AI \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 VERA-MH \ud3c9\uac00\uc758 \uc784\uc0c1\uc801 \uc720\ud6a8\uc131\uacfc \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \uac80\ud1a0\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uba3c\uc800 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uae30\ubc18 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790(\uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8)\uc640 \uc77c\ubc18 \ubaa9\uc801 AI \ucc57\ubd07 \uac04\uc758 \ub300\ud654 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc790\uaca9\uc744 \uac16\ucd98 \uc815\uc2e0 \uac74\uac15 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\ub4e4\uc740 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ub41c \ub300\ud654\ub97c \uc548\uc804 \ubc0f \ube44\uc548\uc804 \ucc57\ubd07 \ud589\ub3d9\uacfc \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud604\uc2e4\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud3c9\uac00 \ub8e8\ube0c\ub9ad(\uc810\uc218 \uc548\ub0b4\uc11c)\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Christensen"], "title": "GAMMS: Graph based Adversarial Multiagent Modeling Simulator", "comment": null, "summary": "As intelligent systems and multi-agent coordination become increasingly central to real-world applications, there is a growing need for simulation tools that are both scalable and accessible. Existing high-fidelity simulators, while powerful, are often computationally expensive and ill-suited for rapid prototyping or large-scale agent deployments. We present GAMMS (Graph based Adversarial Multiagent Modeling Simulator), a lightweight yet extensible simulation framework designed to support fast development and evaluation of agent behavior in environments that can be represented as graphs. GAMMS emphasizes five core objectives: scalability, ease of use, integration-first architecture, fast visualization feedback, and real-world grounding. It enables efficient simulation of complex domains such as urban road networks and communication systems, supports integration with external tools (e.g., machine learning libraries, planning solvers), and provides built-in visualization with minimal configuration. GAMMS is agnostic to policy type, supporting heuristic, optimization-based, and learning-based agents, including those using large language models. By lowering the barrier to entry for researchers and enabling high-performance simulations on standard hardware, GAMMS facilitates experimentation and innovation in multi-agent systems, autonomous planning, and adversarial modeling.

We evaluate StagePilot through LLM-based simulations, measuring stage completion, dialogue efficiency, and emotional engagement. Results show that StagePilot generates realistic and coherent conversations aligned with grooming dynamics.

However, existing benchmarks often assume idealized communication between agents, limiting our ability to diagnose whether LLMs can maintain and repair interactions in more realistic, imperfect settings. To close this gap, we present \\textsc{SocialVeil}, a social learning environment that can simulate social interaction under cognitive-difference-induced communication barriers. Grounded in a systematic literature review of communication challenges in human interaction, \\textsc{SocialVeil} introduces three representative types of such disruption, \\emph{semantic vagueness}, \\emph{sociocultural mismatch}, and \\emph{emotional interference}. We also introduce two barrier-aware evaluation metrics, \\emph{unresolved confusion} and \\emph{mutual understanding}, to evaluate interaction quality under impaired communication. Experiments across 720 scenarios and four frontier LLMs show that barriers consistently impair performance, with mutual understanding reduced by over 45\\% on average, and confusion elevated by nearly 50\\%. Human evaluations validate the fidelity of these simulated barriers (ICC$\\approx$0.78, Pearson r$\\approx$0.80).

Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have recently shown to be useful for data-centric interpretability. In this work, we analyze large-scale reinforcement learning training runs from the sophisticated environment of Full-Press Diplomacy by applying pretrained SAEs, alongside LLM-summarizer methods. We introduce Meta-Autointerp, a method for grouping SAE features into interpretable hypotheses about training dynamics. We discover fine-grained behaviors including role-playing patterns, degenerate outputs, language switching, alongside high-level strategic behaviors and environment-specific bugs. Through automated evaluation, we validate that 90% of discovered SAE Meta-Features are significant, and find a surprising reward hacking behavior. However, through two user studies, we find that even subjectively interesting and seemingly helpful SAE features may be worse than useless to humans, along with most LLM generated hypotheses. However, a subset of SAE-derived hypotheses are predictively useful for downstream tasks. We further provide validation by augmenting an untrained agent's system prompt, improving the score by +14.2%. Overall, we show that SAEs and LLM-summarizer provide complementary views into agent behavior, and together our framework forms a practical starting point for future data-centric interpretability work on ensuring trustworthy LLM behavior throughout training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \ud574\uc11d\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ud76c\uc18c

However, existing benchmarks suffer from severe data contamination and a lack of scene specificity, inadequate for assessing agent capabilities in unseen settings. To address this, we propose a dynamic in-situ task generation method for unseen environments inspired by human cognition. We define tasks through a structured graph representation and construct a two-stage interaction-evolution task generation system for embodied agents (TEA). In the interaction stage, the agent actively interacts with the environment, creating a loop between task execution and generation that allows for continuous task generation. In the evolution stage, task graph modeling allows us to recombine and reuse existing tasks to generate new ones without external data. Experiments across 10 unseen scenes demonstrate that TEA automatically generated 87,876 tasks in two cycles, which human verification confirmed to be physically reasonable and encompassing essential daily cognitive capabilities. Benchmarking SOTA models against humans on our in-situ tasks reveals that models, despite excelling on public benchmarks, perform surprisingly poorly on basic perception tasks, severely lack 3D interaction awareness and show high sensitivity to task types in reasoning. These sobering findings highlight the necessity of in-situ evaluation before deploying agents into real-world human environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0

To address this, we propose ProAct, a framework that enables agents to internalize accurate lookahead reasoning through a two-stage training paradigm. First, we introduce Grounded LookAhead Distillation (GLAD), where the agent undergoes supervised fine-tuning on trajectories derived from environment-based search. By compressing complex search trees into concise, causal reasoning chains, the agent learns the logic of foresight without the computational overhead of inference-time search. Second, to further refine decision accuracy, we propose the Monte-Carlo Critic (MC-Critic), a plug-and-play auxiliary value estimator designed to enhance policy-gradient algorithms like PPO and GRPO. By leveraging lightweight environment rollouts to calibrate value estimates, MC-Critic provides a low-variance signal that facilitates stable policy optimization without relying on expensive model-based value approximation. Experiments on both stochastic (e.g., 2048) and deterministic (e.g., Sokoban) environments demonstrate that ProAct significantly improves planning accuracy. Notably, a 4B parameter model trained with ProAct outperforms all open-source baselines and rivals state-of-the-art closed-source models, while demonstrating robust generalization to unseen environments.

While some frameworks offer explicit architectures for collaboration, many deployed agentic systems operate as black boxes to users. We address this by introducing Agentic Workflow Reconstruction (AWR), a new task aiming to synthesize an explicit, interpretable stand-in workflow that approximates a black-box system using only input--output access. We propose AgentXRay, a search-based framework that formulates AWR as a combinatorial optimization problem over discrete agent roles and tool invocations in a chain-structured workflow space. Unlike model distillation, AgentXRay produces editable white-box workflows that match target outputs under an observable, output-based proxy metric, without accessing model parameters. To navigate the vast search space, AgentXRay employs Monte Carlo Tree Search enhanced by a scoring-based Red-Black Pruning mechanism, which dynamically integrates proxy quality with search depth. Experiments across diverse domains demonstrate that AgentXRay achieves higher proxy similarity and reduces token consumption compared to unpruned search, enabling deeper workflow exploration under fixed iteration budgets.", "AI": {"tldr": "Agentic Workflow Reconstruction (AWR)\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ube14\ub799 \ubc15\uc2a4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744

Existing pruning methods fail to simultaneously satisfy differentiability, efficiency, and the strict static budgets required for hardware overhead. To address this, we propose Shiva-DiT, which effectively reconciles these conflicting requirements via Residual-Based Differentiable Top-$k$ Selection. By leveraging a residual-aware straight-through estimator, our method enforces deterministic token counts for static compilation while preserving end-to-end learnability through residual gradient estimation. Furthermore, we introduce a Context-Aware Router and Adaptive Ratio Policy to autonomously learn an adaptive pruning schedule. Experiments on mainstream models, including SD3.5, demonstrate that Shiva-DiT establishes a new Pareto frontier, achieving a 1.54$\\times$ wall-clock speedup with superior fidelity compared to existing baselines, effectively eliminating ragged tensor overheads.", "AI": {"tldr": "Shiva-DiT\ub294 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud1a0\ud070 \uc120\ud0dd\uacfc \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc801\uc778 \uac00\uc9c0\uce58\uae30\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 Diffusion Transformers\uc758 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "Diffusion Transformers\uc758 \uc790\uac00 \uc8fc\uc758 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \ub192\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "Residual-Based Differentiable Top-$k$ Selection \uae30\ubc95\uacfc Context-Aware Router \ubc0f Adaptive Ratio Policy\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub3d9\uc801 \uac00\uc9c0\uce58\uae30 \uc77c\uc815\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5.", "result": "SD3.5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \uae30\uc900 \ub300\ube44 1.54\ubc30\uc758 \uc18d\ub3c4 \uc99d\uac00\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0, \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ud655\ubcf4.", "conclusion": "Shiva-DiT\ub294 Diffusion Transformers\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba74\uc11c \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uc904\uc5ec \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 Pareto \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \ud655\ub9bd\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "Diffusion Transformers(DiTs)\ub294 \uc790\uae30 \uc8fc\uc758 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uc81c\uacf1 \uaddc\ubaa8\uc758 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc9c0\ub300\ud55c \ubd80\ub2f4\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uac00\uc9c0\uce58\uae30 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\uc5d0 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ucc28\ubcc4\uc131, \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \ubc0f \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \uc815\uc801 \uc608\uc0b0\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ucda9\uc871\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Residual-Based Differentiable Top-$k$ Selection\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc0c1\ucda9\ub418\ub294 \uc694\uad6c\uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\ud654\ud558\ub294 Shiva-DiT\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc794\ucc28 \uc778\uc2dd \uc9c1\ud1b5 \ucd94\uc815\uae30\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc815\uc801 \ucef4\ud30c\uc77c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uacb0\uc815\uc801\uc778 \ud1a0\ud070 \uc218\ub97c \uac15\uc81c\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc794\ucc28 \uacbd\ub7c9\ud654 \ucd94\uc815\uae30\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc885\ub2e8 \uac04 \ud559\uc2b5 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uac00\uc9c0\uce58\uae30 \uc77c\uc815\uc744 \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 Context-Aware Router\uc640 Adaptive Ratio Policy\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Across both closed and open models, agents typically navigate to relevant pages but retrieve decisive hidden evidence in only a small fraction of cases. When tasks require overturning misleading surface-level signals, performance drops sharply to near chance accuracy. Agents frequently hallucinate investigative reasoning by claiming to rely on evidence they never accessed. Even when correct context is discovered, agents often fail to integrate it into their final decision. Providing more explicit instructions improves context discovery but often reduces overall accuracy, revealing a tradeoff between procedural compliance and effective judgement.

Supplementary material is included at the end of the main paper (16 pages, 15 figures, 2 tables)", "summary": "Graphical User Interface (GUI) agent is pivotal to advancing intelligent human-computer interaction paradigms. Constructing powerful GUI agents necessitates the large-scale annotation of high-quality user-behavior trajectory data (i.e., intent-trajectory pairs) for training. However, manual annotation methods and current GUI agent data mining approaches typically face three critical challenges: high construction cost, poor data quality, and low data richness. To address these issues, we propose M$^2$-Miner, the first low-cost and automated mobile GUI agent data-mining framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). For better data mining efficiency and quality, we present a collaborative multi-agent framework, comprising InferAgent, OrchestraAgent, and JudgeAgent for guidance, acceleration, and evaluation. To further enhance the efficiency of mining and enrich intent diversity, we design an intent recycling strategy to extract extra valuable interaction trajectories. Additionally, a progressive model-in-the-loop training strategy is introduced to improve the success rate of data mining. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that the GUI agent fine-tuned using our mined data achieves state-of-the-art performance on several commonly used mobile GUI benchmarks. Our work will be released to facilitate the community research.", "AI": {"tldr": "M$^2$-Miner\ub294 \ube44\uc6a9 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c GUI

Such constraints arise naturally in safety-critical applications and in rare-event simulation, where soft or reward-based guidance methods offer no guarantee of constraint satisfaction. Building on a probabilistic interpretation of diffusion models, we develop a principled conditional diffusion guidance framework based on Doob's h-transform, martingale representation and quadratic variation process. Specifically, the resulting guided dynamics augment a pretrained diffusion with an explicit drift correction involving the logarithmic gradient of a conditioning function, without modifying the pretrained score network. Leveraging martingale and quadratic-variation identities, we propose two novel off-policy learning algorithms based on a martingale loss and a martingale-covariation loss to estimate h and its gradient using only trajectories from the pretrained model. We provide non-asymptotic guarantees for the resulting conditional sampler in both total variation and Wasserstein distances, explicitly characterizing the impact of score approximation and guidance estimation errors.

At each time step, an agent is allowed to query pairs of items and observe bandit binary feedback. If the pair of items belongs to the same (resp.\\ different) cluster, the observed feedback is $1$ with probability $p>1/2$ (resp.\\ $q<1/2$). Leveraging the ubiquitous change-of-measure technique, we establish a fundamental lower bound on the expected number of queries needed to achieve a desired confidence in the clustering accuracy, formulated as a sup-inf optimization problem. Building on this theoretical foundation, we design an asymptotically optimal algorithm in which the stopping criterion involves an empirical version of the inner infimum -- the Generalized Likelihood Ratio (GLR) statistic -- being compared to a threshold. We develop a computationally feasible variant of the GLR statistic and show that its performance gap to the lower bound can be accurately empirically estimated and remains within a constant multiple of the lower bound.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubd84\uc11d \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \ub178\uc774\uc988\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \uc218\uc9d1\ub41c \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud574 $M$ \ud56d\ubaa9\uc744 $K$ \uac1c\uc758 \uadf8\ub8f9\uc73c\ub85c \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130\ub9c1\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub178\uc774\uc988\uc640 \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\uc9d1\ub41c \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130\ub9c1\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc30d \ud56d\ubaa9\uc744 \ucffc\ub9ac\ud558\uace0 \uc774\uc9c4 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \uad00\ucc30\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \uc608\uc0c1 \ucffc\ub9ac \uc218\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud558\ud55c\uc744 \uc218\ub9bd\ud558\uace0 GLR \ud1b5\uacc4\ub7c9\uacfc \uc784\uacc4\uac12\uc744 \ube44\uad50\ud558\ub294 \ube44\ub300\uce6d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub41c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130\ub9c1 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c desired confidence\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ucffc\ub9ac \uc218\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ud558\ud55c\uc744 \uc218\ub9bd\ud558\uba70, GLR \ud1b5\uacc4\ub7c9\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ub0ae\uc740 \uacbd\uacc4 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \ucd94\uc815\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130\ub9c1 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub178\uc774\uc988\ub97c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uae30\ubc18\uc774 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub178\uc774\uc988\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\uc9d1\ub41c \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec $M$ \ud56d\ubaa9\uc744 \uc54c \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc218\uc758 $K$ \uac1c\uc758 \uad6c\ubcc4\ub41c \uadf8\ub8f9\uc73c\ub85c \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130\ub9c1\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubd84\uc11d \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac01 \uc2dc\uac04 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ud56d\ubaa9 \uc30d\uc744 \ucffc\ub9ac\ud558\uace0 \ubc34\ub527 \uc774\uc9c4 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \uad00\ucc30\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud56d\ubaa9 \uc30d\uc774 \uac19\uc740 \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130\uc5d0 \uc18d\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0(\uc751\ub2f5 1\uc758 \ud655\ub960 $p>1/2$) \ub610\ub294 \ub2e4\ub978 \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130\uc5d0 \uc18d\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0(\uc751\ub2f5 0\uc758 \ud655\ub960 $q<1/2$)\uc758 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \uce21\ub3c4 \ubcc0\uacbd \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130\ub9c1 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub3c4 \ub2ec\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc608\uc0c1 \ucffc\ub9ac \uc218\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ud558\ud55c\uc744 \uc124\uc815\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c sup-inf \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uae30\ubc18\uc744 \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub0b4\ubd80 \ucd5c\uc19f\uac12\uc758 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \ubc84\uc804\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \uc815\uc9c0 \uae30\uc900\uc774 \uc784\uacc4\uac12\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ub418\ub294 \ube44\ub300\uce6d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub41c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 GLR \ud1b5\uacc4\ub7c9\uc758 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubcc0\ud615\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uace0, \uc774 \uc131\ub2a5 \uaca9\ucc28\uac00 \ub0ae\uc740 \uacbd\uacc4 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\uc815\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

While large language models (LLMs) have been shown to reproduce well-known biases, a more critical question is whether LLMs can predict biases at the individual level and emulate the dynamics of biased human behavior when contextual factors, such as cognitive load, interact with these biases. We adapted three well-established decision scenarios into a conversational setting and conducted a human experiment (N=1100). Participants engaged with a chatbot that facilitates decision-making through simple or complex dialogues. Results revealed robust biases. To evaluate how LLMs emulate human decision-making under similar interactive conditions, we used participant demographics and dialogue transcripts to simulate these conditions with LLMs based on GPT-4 and GPT-5.

Cross-lingual knowledge transfer has emerged as a promising approach to address this challenge by leveraging resources from high-resource languages. In this paper, we investigate methods for transferring linguistic knowledge from high-resource languages to low-resource languages, where the number of labeled training instances is in hundreds. We focus on sentence-level and word-level tasks. We introduce a novel method, GETR (Graph-Enhanced Token Representation) for cross-lingual knowledge transfer along with two adopted baselines (a) augmentation in hidden layers and (b) token embedding transfer through token translation. Experimental results demonstrate that our GNN-based approach significantly outperforms existing multilingual and cross-lingual baseline methods, achieving 13 percentage point improvements on truly low-resource languages (Mizo, Khasi) for POS tagging, and 20 and 27 percentage point improvements in macro-F1 on simulated low-resource languages (Marathi, Bangla, Malayalam) across sentiment classification and NER tasks respectively. We also present a detailed analysis of the transfer mechanisms and identify key factors that contribute to successful knowledge transfer in this linguistic context.", "AI": {"tldr":

This challenge is particularly acute for autonomous agents in dynamic environments that require frequent, real-time belief updates. Existing methods are often inefficient for ongoing reasoning, as they re-evaluate the entire model upon any change, failing to exploit that real-world information streams have heterogeneous update rates. To address this, we approach the problem from a reactive, asynchronous, probabilistic reasoning perspective. We first introduce Resin (Reactive Signal Inference), a probabilistic programming language that merges probabilistic logic with reactive programming. Furthermore, to provide efficient and exact semantics for Resin, we propose Reactive Circuits (RCs). Formulated as a meta-structure over Algebraic Circuits and asynchronous data streams, RCs are time-dynamic Directed Acyclic Graphs that autonomously adapt themselves based on the volatility of input signals. In high-fidelity drone swarm simulations, our approach achieves several orders of magnitude of speedup over frequency-agnostic inference. We demonstrate that RCs' structural adaptations successfully capture environmental dynamics, significantly reducing latency and facilitating reactive real-time reasoning. By partitioning computations based on the estimated Frequency of Change in the asynchronous inputs, large inference tasks can be decomposed into individually memoized sub-problems. This ensures that only the specific components of a model affected by new information are re-evaluated, drastically reducing redundant computation in streaming contexts.", "AI": {"tldr":

Code available at https://github.com/bennycheung/GameGrammarCLI", "summary": "Traditional ontologies excel at describing domain structure but cannot generate novel artifacts. Large language models generate fluently but produce outputs that lack structural validity, hallucinating mechanisms without components, goals without end conditions. We introduce Generative Ontology, a framework that synthesizes these complementary strengths: ontology provides the grammar; the LLM provides the creativity.\n  Generative Ontology encodes domain knowledge as executable Pydantic schemas that constrain LLM generation via DSPy signatures. A multi-agent pipeline assigns specialized roles to different ontology domains: a Mechanics Architect designs game systems, a Theme Weaver integrates narrative, a Balance Critic identifies exploits. Each agent carrying a professional \"anxiety\" that prevents shallow, agreeable outputs. Retrieval-augmented generation grounds novel designs in precedents from existing exemplars, while iterative validation ensures coherence between mechanisms and components.\n  We demonstrate the framework through GameGrammar, a system for generating complete tabletop game designs. Given a thematic prompt (\"bioluminescent fungi competing in a cave ecosystem\"), the pipeline produces structurally complete, playable game specifications with mechanisms, components, victory conditions, and setup instructions. These outputs satisfy ontological constraints while remaining genuinely creative.\n  The pattern generalizes beyond games.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant potential in TKGQA, current prompting strategies constrain their efficacy in two primary ways. First, they are prone to reasoning hallucinations under complex temporal constraints. Second, static prompting limits model autonomy and generalization, as it lack optimization through dynamic interaction with temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) environments. To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{TKG-Thinker}, a novel agent equipped with autonomous planning and adaptive retrieval capabilities for reasoning over TKGs. Specifically, TKG-Thinker performs in-depth temporal reasoning through dynamic multi-turn interactions with TKGs via a dual-training strategy. We first apply Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with chain-of thought data to instill core planning capabilities, followed by a Reinforcement Learning (RL) stage that leverages multi-dimensional rewards to refine reasoning policies under intricate temporal constraints.

As these intelligent assistants coordinate with external services via protocols such as Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A), they establish attack surfaces where manipulations can propagate through natural language payloads, potentially causing severe consequences ranging from driver distraction to unauthorized vehicle control. Existing AI security frameworks, while foundational, lack the rigorous \"separation of concerns\" standard in safety-critical systems engineering by co-mingling the concepts of what is being protected (assets) with how it is attacked (attack paths). This paper addresses this methodological gap by proposing a threat modeling framework called AgentHeLLM (Agent Hazard Exploration for LLM Assistants) that formally separates asset identification from attack path analysis. We introduce a human-centric asset taxonomy derived from harm-oriented \"victim modeling\" and inspired by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and a formal graph-based model that distinguishes poison paths (malicious data propagation) from trigger paths (activation actions). We demonstrate the framework's practical applicability through an open-source attack path suggestion tool AgentHeLLM Attack Path Generator that automates multi-stage threat discovery using a bi-level search strategy.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ub300\ud654\ud615 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ucc28\ub7c9\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud560 \ub54c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubcf4\uc548 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8e8\ub294 \uc5f0\uad6c.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 AI \ubcf4\uc548 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc790\uc0b0 \ubcf4\ud638\uc640 \uacf5\uaca9 \uacbd\ub85c \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \ud63c\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc548\uc804-critical \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\ub9c1\uc5d0\uc11c \uc694\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c '\uad00\uc2ec\uc0ac \ubd84\ub9ac' \uae30\uc900\uc744 \ucda9\uc871\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "AgentHeLLM\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc704\ud611 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc790\uc0b0 \uc2dd\ubcc4\uacfc \uacf5\uaca9 \uacbd\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uacf5\uc2dd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ub9ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc778\uac04 \uc911\uc2ec \uc790\uc0b0 \ubd84\ub958\ubc95\uacfc \uc815\ud615 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0, \uc545\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc804\ud30c\uc640 \ud65c\uc131\ud654 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uad6c\ubcc4\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf4\uc548 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud0d0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "AgentHeLLM Attack Path Generator\ub77c\ub294 \uc624\ud508 \uc18c\uc2a4 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc704\ud611 \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc2e4\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ub300\ud654\ud615 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ucc28\ub7c9\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 AI, \uc790\ub3d9\ucc28 \uc548\uc804 \ubc0f \uc0c1\ud638 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc758 \uad50\ucc28\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubcf4\uc548 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc9c0\ub2a5\ud615 \ubcf4\uc870\uc778\uc774 Google\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04(A2A)\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc678\ubd80 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc640 \ud611\ub825\ud558\uba74 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \ud398\uc774\ub85c\ub4dc\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc870\uc791\uc774 \uc804\ud30c\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uacf5\uaca9 \ud45c\uba74\uc774 \ud615\uc131\ub418\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc6b4\uc804\uc790\uc758 \uc8fc\uc758 \uc0b0\ub9cc\uc5d0\uc11c\ubd80\ud130 \ubb34\ub2e8 \ucc28\ub7c9 \uc81c\uc5b4\uc5d0 \uc774\ub974\uae30\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 AI \ubcf4\uc548 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc548\uc804-critical \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\ub9c1\uc5d0\uc11c \uc694\uad6c\ub418\ub294 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c '\uad00\uc2ec\uc0ac \ubd84\ub9ac' \uae30\uc900\uc774 \uacb0\uc5ec\ub418\uc5b4 \uc790\uc0b0\uc774 \ubcf4\ud638\ub418\ub294 \uac83(\uc790\uc0b0)\uacfc \uc774\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacf5\uaca9 \ubc29\ubc95(\uacf5\uaca9 \uacbd\ub85c)\uc744 \ud63c\ud569\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc790\uc0b0 \uc2dd\ubcc4\uc744 \uacf5\uaca9 \uacbd\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\uacfc \uacf5\uc2dd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 AgentHeLLM(LLM \ubcf4\uc870 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc704\ud5d8 \ud0d0\uc0c9)\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc704\ud611 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc801 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud53c\ud574 \uc9c0\ud5a5\uc758 '\ud53c\ud574\uc790 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1'\uc5d0\uc11c \ud30c\uc0dd\ub41c \uc778\uac04 \uc911\uc2ec \uc790\uc0b0 \ubd84\ub958\ubc95\uacfc \uc545\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc804\ud30c(\ub3c5\uadf9\ubb3c \uacbd\ub85c)\uc640 \ud65c\uc131\ud654 \ud589\ub3d9(\ud2b8\ub9ac\uac70 \uacbd\ub85c)\uc744 \uad6c\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \uc815\ud615 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc704\ud611 \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 AgentHeLLM Attack Path Generator\ub77c\ub294 \uc624\ud508 \uc18c\uc2a4 \uacf5\uaca9 \uacbd\ub85c \uc81c\uc548 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

An Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) agent is implemented in classical, full quantum, and hybrid variants, integrating transformer architectures to capture the relationships between vehicles, clients, and the depot through self- and cross-attention mechanisms. The experiments focus on multi-vehicle scenarios with capacity constraints, considering 20 clients and 4 vehicles, and are conducted over ten independent runs. Performance is assessed using routing distance, route compactness, and route overlap. The results show that all three approaches are capable of learning effective routing policies. However, quantum-enhanced models outperform the classical baseline and produce more robust route organization, with the hybrid architecture achieving the best overall performance across distance, compactness, and route overlap.

Recent studies have leveraged pre-trained models to extract features for downstream tasks such as SER. This work explores the capabilities of Whisper, a pre-trained ASR system, in speech emotion recognition by proposing two attention-based pooling methods, Multi-head Attentive Average Pooling and QKV Pooling, designed to efficiently reduce the dimensionality of Whisper representations while preserving emotional features. We experiment on English and Persian, using the IEMOCAP and ShEMO datasets respectively, with Whisper Tiny and Small. Our multi-head QKV architecture achieves state-of-the-art results on the ShEMO dataset, with a 2.47% improvement in unweighted accuracy. We further compare the performance of different Whisper encoder layers and find that intermediate layers often perform better for SER on the Persian dataset, providing a lightweight and efficient alternative to much larger models such as HuBERT X-Large. Our findings highlight the potential of Whisper as a representation extractor for SER and demonstrate the effectiveness of attention-based pooling for dimension reduction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 Whisper\ub77c\ub294 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c ASR \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc74c\uc131 \uac10\uc815 \uc778\uc2dd \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\uba70, \uac10\uc815\uc801 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc874\ud558\uba74\uc11c Whisper \ud45c\ud604\uc758 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc744 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc904\uc774\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc758 \uae30\ubc18 \ud480\ub9c1 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc74c\uc131 \uac10\uc815 \uc778\uc2dd(SER) \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud45c\uc900\ud654\ub41c \ud070 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b \ubd80\uc871\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uacaa\uc5b4\uc654\ub2e4.", "method": "Multi-head Attentive Average Pooling\uacfc QKV Pooling\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc758 \uae30\ubc18 \ud480\ub9c1 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec Whisper\uc758 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc744 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc904\uc778\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud5e4\ub4dc QKV \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub294 ShEMO \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uae30\uc220 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc5bb\uc5c8\uace0, \ube44\uac00\uc911 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uac00 2.47% \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Whisper\ub294 SER\uc758 \ud45c\ud604 \ucd94\ucd9c\uae30\ub85c\uc11c\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70, \ucc28\uc6d0 \ucd95\uc18c\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc8fc\uc758 \uae30\ubc18 \ud480\ub9c1\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc74c\uc131 \uac10\uc815 \uc778\uc2dd(SER) \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud45c\uc900\ud654\ub41c \ud06c\uace0 \ucda9\ubd84\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc758 \ubd80\uc871\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c\uacc4\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec SER\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ub2e4\uc6b4\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9bc \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uac10\uc815\uc801 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc874\ud558\uba74\uc11c Whisper \ud45c\ud604\uc758 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc744 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc904\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c Multi-head Attentive Average Pooling\uacfc QKV Pooling\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc758 \uae30\ubc18 \ud480\ub9c1 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec, \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c ASR \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc778 Whisper\uc758 \uc74c\uc131 \uac10\uc815 \uc778\uc2dd \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac01\uac01 IEMOCAP\uacfc ShEMO \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc601\uc5b4\uc640 \ud398\ub974\uc2dc\uc544\uc5b4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 Whisper Tiny\uc640 Small\uc744 \uc2e4\ud5d8\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud5e4\ub4dc QKV \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub294 ShEMO \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uae30\uc220\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uae30\ub85d\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \ube44\uac00\uc911 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uac00 2.47% \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub610\ud55c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c Whisper \uc778\ucf54\ub354 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc600\uace0, \ud398\ub974\uc2dc\uc544\uc5b4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uac04 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\uac00 \uc885\uc885 SER \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, HuBERT X-Large\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ud6e8\uc52c \ub354 \ud070 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacbd\ub7c9\uc774\uace0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ub300\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud568\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc1c\uacac\uc740 SER\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud45c\ud604 \ucd94\ucd9c\uae30\ub85c\uc11c Whisper\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uace0, \ucc28\uc6d0 \ucd95\uc18c\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc8fc\uc758 \uae30\ubc18 \ud480\ub9c1\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4."}}

Simulators remain a security blind spot, however, enabling adversarial developers to alter the dynamics of their released simulators for malicious purposes. Therefore, in this work we highlight a novel threat, demonstrating how simulator dynamics can be exploited to stealthily implant action-level backdoors into RL agents. The backdoor then allows an adversary to reliably activate targeted actions in an agent upon observing a predefined ``trigger'', leading to potentially dangerous consequences. Traditional backdoor attacks are limited in their strong threat models, assuming the adversary has near full control over an agent's training pipeline, enabling them to both alter and observe agent's rewards. As these assumptions are infeasible to implement within a simulator, we propose a new attack ``Daze'' which is able to reliably and stealthily implant backdoors into RL agents trained for real world tasks without altering or even observing their rewards. We provide formal proof of Daze's effectiveness in guaranteeing attack success across general RL tasks along with extensive empirical evaluations on both discrete and continuous action space domains. We additionally provide the first example of RL backdoor attacks transferring to real, robotic hardware. These developments motivate further research into securing all components of the RL training pipeline to prevent malicious attacks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uac15\ud654

To connect intelligence to physical efficiency, we propose two complementary bits-per-joule metrics under explicit accounting conventions: (1) Thermodynamic Epiplexity per Joule -- bits of structural information about a theoretical environment-instance variable newly encoded in an agent's internal state per unit measured energy within a stated boundary -- and (2) Empowerment per Joule -- the embodied sensorimotor channel capacity (control information) per expected energetic cost over a fixed horizon. These provide two axes of physical intelligence: recognition (model-building) vs.control (action influence). Drawing on stochastic thermodynamics, we show how a Landauer-scale closed-cycle benchmark for epiplexity acquisition follows as a corollary of a standard thermodynamic-learning inequality under explicit subsystem assumptions, and we clarify how Landauer-scaled costs act as closed-cycle benchmarks under explicit reset/reuse and boundary-closure assumptions; conversely, we give a simple decoupling construction showing that without such assumptions -- and without charging for externally prepared low-entropy resources (e.g.fresh memory) crossing the boundary -- information gain and in-boundary dissipation need not be tightly linked. For empirical settings where the latent structure variable is unavailable, we align the operational notion of epiplexity with compute-bounded MDL epiplexity and recommend reporting MDL-epiplexity / compression-gain surrogates as companions. Finally, we propose a unified efficiency framework that reports both metrics together with a minimal checklist of boundary/energy accounting, coarse-graining/noise, horizon/reset, and cost conventions to reduce ambiguity and support consistent bits-per-joule comparisons, and we sketch connections to energy-adjusted scaling analyses.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ud604\ub300 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740

Although these systems have gained considerable attention for their potential to address the challenges associated with typical inventory management methods, key uncertainties regarding their effectiveness persist. Specifically, it is unclear whether LLM-based MASs can consistently derive optimal ordering policies and adapt to diverse supply chain scenarios. To address these questions, we examine an LLM-based MAS with a fixed-ordering strategy prompt that encodes the stepwise processes of the problem setting and a safe-stock strategy commonly used in inventory management. Our empirical results demonstrate that, even without detailed prompt adjustments, an LLM-based MAS can determine optimal ordering decisions in a restricted scenario. To enhance adaptability, we propose a novel agent called AIM-RM, which leverages similar historical experiences through similarity matching. Our results show that AIM-RM outperforms benchmark methods across various supply chain scenarios, highlighting its robustness and adaptability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uc7ac\uace0 \uad00\ub9ac\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uc7ac\uace0 \uad00\ub9ac\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc774 \ud06c\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc774 \uc874\uc7ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uace0\uc815 \uc8fc\ubb38 \uc804\ub7b5 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 LLM \uae30\ubc18 MAS\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0, AIM-RM\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc720\uc0ac\uc131 \ub9e4\uce6d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "AIM-RM\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uacf5\uae09\ub9dd \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\ub294 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18 MAS\uac00 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uc8fc\ubb38 \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ub0b4\ub9b4 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uacf5\uae09\ub9dd \uad00\ub9ac\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec \uc694\uc18c\uc778 \uc7ac\uace0 \uad00\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c\uc11c \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uae30\ubc18 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(MAS)\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc7ac\uace0 \uad00\ub9ac \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ub41c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uad00\uc2ec\uc744 \ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uadf8 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc8fc\uc694 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc774 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc874\uc7ac\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788, LLM \uae30\ubc18 MAS\uac00 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uc8fc\ubb38 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uace0 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uacf5\uae09\ub9dd \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud558\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c \uc124\uc815\uc758 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc801 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ud558\ub294 \uace0\uc815 \uc8fc\ubb38 \uc804\ub7b5 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\uc640 \uc7ac\uace0 \uad00\ub9ac\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \uc548\uc804 \uc7ac\uace0 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 LLM \uae30\ubc18 MAS\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc2e4\uc99d \uacb0\uacfc\ub294, \uc0c1\uc138\ud55c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc870\uc815 \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 LLM \uae30\ubc18 MAS\uac00 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uc8fc\ubb38 \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ub0b4\ub9b4 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \uc801\uc751\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131 \ub9e4\uce6d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 AIM-RM\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 AIM-RM\uc774 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uacf5\uae09\ub9dd \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uadf8 \uac15\uac74\uc131\uacfc \uc801\uc751\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

Existing methods heavily depend on human red-teamers and hand-crafted prompts, limiting their scalability and adaptability. We propose AutoInject, a reinforcement learning framework that generates universal, transferable adversarial suffixes while jointly optimizing for attack success and utility preservation on benign tasks. Our black-box method supports both query-based optimization and transfer attacks to unseen models and tasks.
