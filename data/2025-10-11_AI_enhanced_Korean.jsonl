This work\npresents a comparative evaluation of FHE and GC for secure neural network\ninference.

Existing research often depends on conspicuous\nUI overlays, elevated permissions, or impractical threat models, limiting\nstealth and real-world applicability. In this paper, we present a practical and\nstealthy one-shot jailbreak attack that leverages in-app prompt injections:\nmalicious applications embed short prompts in UI text that remain inert during\nhuman interaction but are revealed when an agent drives the UI via ADB (Android\nDebug Bridge). Our framework comprises three crucial components: (1)\nlow-privilege perception-chain targeting, which injects payloads into malicious\napps as the agent's visual inputs; (2) stealthy user-invisible activation, a\ntouch-based trigger that discriminates agent from human touches using physical\ntouch attributes and exposes the payload only during agent operation; and (3)\none-shot prompt efficacy, a heuristic-guided, character-level\niterative-deepening search algorithm (HG-IDA*) that performs one-shot,\nkeyword-level detoxification to evade on-device safety filters. We evaluate\nacross multiple LVLM backends, including closed-source services and\nrepresentative open-source models within three Android applications, and we\nobserve high planning and execution hijack rates in single-shot scenarios\n(e.g., GPT-4o: 82.5% planning / 75.0% execution).

Our contributions are fourfold:\n(i) a constraint-based semantics that renders oracle filtering as a\nprogram-logic judgment, (ii) a proof that greedy selection enjoys local\nlikelihood dominance under sound and complete guards (Theorem 2.7), (iii) an\nentropy-style invariant that quantifies factual risk via knowledge-aware safe\nmass, and (iv) a multi-agent operational calculus with verified Lean artefacts\nto certify implementation behaviour.

This paper introduces\nL2M-AID, a novel framework for Autonomous Industrial Defense using\nLLM-empowered, Multi-agent reinforcement learning. L2M-AID orchestrates a team\nof collaborative agents, each driven by a Large Language Model (LLM), to\nachieve adaptive and resilient security. The core innovation lies in the deep\nfusion of two AI paradigms: we leverage an LLM as a semantic bridge to\ntranslate vast, unstructured telemetry into a rich, contextual state\nrepresentation, enabling agents to reason about adversary intent rather than\nmerely matching patterns. This semantically-aware state empowers a Multi-Agent\nReinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm, MAPPO, to learn complex cooperative\nstrategies. The MARL reward function is uniquely engineered to balance security\nobjectives (threat neutralization) with operational imperatives, explicitly\npenalizing actions that disrupt physical process stability. To validate our\napproach, we conduct extensive experiments on the benchmark SWaT dataset and a\nnovel synthetic dataset generated based on the MITRE ATT&CK for ICS framework.\nResults demonstrate that L2M-AID significantly outperforms traditional IDS,\ndeep learning anomaly detectors, and single-agent RL baselines across key\nmetrics, achieving a 97.2% detection rate while reducing false positives by\nover 80% and improving response times by a factor of four. Crucially, it\ndemonstrates superior performance in maintaining physical process stability,\npresenting a robust new paradigm for securing critical national infrastructure.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 L2M-AID\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc0b0\uc5c5 IoT \ubcf4\uc548\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8ec\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc0b0\uc5c5 IoT\uc758 \ud1b5\ud569\uc774 \ub192\uc544\uc9d0\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uba40\ud2f0 \uc2a4\ud14c\uc774\uc9c0 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \ubc29\uc5b4\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6cc\uc84c\ub2e4.", "method": "L2M-AID\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud611\ub825\uc801\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud300\uc744 \uc870\uc9c1\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "L2M-AID\ub294 97.2%\uc758 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uc728\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \uae0d\uc815\ub960\uc744 80% \uc774\uc0c1 \uc904\uc774\uace0 \uc751\ub2f5 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \ub124 \ubc30 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "L2M-AID\ub294 \uad6d\uac00 \uc778\ud504\ub77c\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc0b0\uc5c5 IoT(IIoT)\uc758 \ud1b5\ud569\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ub9e5\ub77d \uc778\uc2dd\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud574\uc9c0\uae30 \ub9c8\ub828\uc774\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 LLM(\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378)\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc790\uc728 \uc0b0\uc5c5 \ubc29\uc5b4\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 L2M-AID\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

While\nMulti-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) enables these agents to learn\nintelligent strategies, it faces challenges of non-stationarity and partial\nobservability. Communications among agents offer a solution, but questions\nremain about its optimal structure and evaluation. This paper explores two\nunderexamined aspects: communication topology and information efficiency. We\ndemonstrate that directed and sequential topologies improve performance while\nreducing communication overhead across both homogeneous and heterogeneous\ntasks.

In this work, we present the first principled framework that joins\nsycophancy and self-bias to mitigate and quantify identity bias in MAD. First,\nwe formalize the debate dynamics as an identity-weighted Bayesian update\nprocess. Second, we propose response anonymization: by removing identity\nmarkers from prompts, agents cannot distinguish \"self\" from \"peer\", which\nforces equal weights on agent identity, thereby reducing bias. Third, we define\nthe Identity Bias Coefficient (IBC), a principled metric that measures how\noften an agent follows a peer versus itself. Empirical studies across multiple\nmodels, datasets and debate rounds confirm that identity bias is widespread,\nwith sycophancy far more common than self-bias. Our findings highlight the need\nto \"mask\" identity to ensure that MAD systems reason based on content rather\nthan source identity.

In this work we propose TS-Agent, a time series reasoning\nagent that leverages LLMs strictly for what they excel at, i.e., gathering\nevidence and synthesizing it into conclusions through step-by-step reasoning,\nwhile delegating the extraction of statistical and structural information to\ntime series analytical tools. Instead of mapping time series into text tokens,\nimages, or embeddings, our agent interacts with raw numeric sequences through\natomic operators, records outputs in an explicit evidence log, and iteratively\nrefines its reasoning under the guidance of a self-critic and a final quality\ngate. This design avoids multi-modal alignment training, preserves the native\nform of time series, ensures interpretability and verifiability, and mitigates\nknowledge leakage or hallucination. Empirically, we evaluate the agent on\nestablished benchmarks. Our experiments show that TS-Agent achieves performance\ncomparable to state-of-the-art LLMs on understanding benchmarks, and delivers\nsignificant improvements on reasoning tasks, where existing

Despite advances\nin large language and vision-language models that enable agents to act\nautonomously and pursue goals in rich settings, their ability to reason about\nsafety, coherence, and trust across modalities remains limited. We introduce a\nreproducible simulation framework for evaluating agents along three dimensions:\n(1) safety improvement over time, including iterative plan revisions in\ntext-visual scenarios; (2) detection of unsafe activities across multiple\ncategories of social situations; and (3) social dynamics, measured as\ninteraction counts and acceptance ratios of social exchanges. Agents are\nequipped with layered memory, dynamic planning, multimodal perception, and are\ninstrumented with SocialMetrics, a suite of behavioral and structural metrics\nthat quantifies plan revisions, unsafe-to-safe conversions, and information\ndiffusion across networks. Experiments show that while agents can detect direct\nmultimodal contradictions, they often fail to align local revisions with global\nsafety, reaching only a 55 percent success rate in correcting unsafe plans.\nAcross eight simulation runs with three models - Claude, GPT-4o mini, and\nQwen-VL - five agents achieved average unsafe-to-safe conversion rates of 75,\n55, and 58 percent, respectively. Overall performance ranged from 20 percent in\nmulti-risk scenarios with GPT-4o mini to 98 percent in localized contexts such\nas fire/heat with Claude. Notably, 45 percent of unsafe actions were accepted\nwhen paired with misleading visuals, showing a strong tendency to overtrust\nimages. These findings expose critical limitations in current architectures and\nprovide a reproducible platform for studying multimodal safety, coherence, and\nsocial dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc7ac\uc0dd\uc0b0 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0dd\uc131 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131, \uc77c\uad00\uc131 \ubc0f \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc0dd\uc131 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131, \uc77c\uad00\uc131 \ubc0f \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc810\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574", "method": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc548\uc804\uc131 \ud5a5\uc0c1, \uc704\ud5d8\ud55c \ud65c\ub3d9 \ud0d0\uc9c0, \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uc5ed\ud559 \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc73c\ub85c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc740 \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \ubaa8\uc21c\uc744 \uac10\uc9c0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\ub098, \uc548\uc804 \uacc4\ud68d \ubcf4\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc774 55%\uc5d0 \ubd88\uacfc\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ud604\uc7ac \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ub178\ucd9c\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \uc548\uc804\uc131\uacfc \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc7ac\uc0dd\uc0b0 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc0dd\uc131 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc744\uae4c?

We\npresent a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that integrates a\nhigh-fidelity, highly efficient climate surrogate directly in the environment\nloop, enabling regional agents to learn climate policies under multi-gas\ndynamics. As a proof of concept, we introduce a recurrent neural network\narchitecture pretrained on ($20{,}000$) multi-gas emission pathways to\nsurrogate the climate model CICERO-SCM. The surrogate model attains\nnear-simulator accuracy with global-mean temperature RMSE $\\approx 0.0004\n\\mathrm{K}$ and approximately $1000\\times$ faster one-step inference. When\nsubstituted for the original simulator in a climate-policy MARL setting, it\naccelerates end-to-end training by $>\\!100\\times$. We show that the surrogate\nand simulator converge to the same optimal policies and propose a methodology\nto assess this property in cases where using the simulator is intractable.

While\ntraditional algorithms and machine learning approaches have achieved success in\nthis domain, they typically require model training, parameter tuning, and\nretraining when accommodating data updates. As Large Language Models (LLMs)\ndemonstrate increasing capabilities in spatial and graph-based reasoning, there\nis growing interest in exploring how these models can be applied to geo-spatial\nproblems.\n  We introduce CompassLLM, a novel multi-agent framework that intelligently\nleverages the reasoning capabilities of LLMs into the geo-spatial domain to\nsolve the popular path query. CompassLLM employs its agents in a two-stage\npipeline: the SEARCH stage that identifies popular paths, and a GENERATE stage\nthat synthesizes novel paths in the absence of an existing one in the\nhistorical trajectory data. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets show\nthat CompassLLM demonstrates superior accuracy in SEARCH and competitive\nperformance in GENERATE while being cost-effective.", "AI": {"tldr": "CompassLLM\uc740 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801 \uada4\uc801 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uae30 \uc788\ub294 \uacbd\ub85c \ucffc\ub9ac\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub3c4\uc2dc \uacc4\ud68d, \ub0b4\ube44\uac8c\uc774\uc158 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubc0f \uc5ec\ud589 \ucd94\ucc9c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc751\uc6a9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801 \uada4\uc801 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uac00\uc7a5 \uc790\uc8fc \uc774\ub3d9\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "CompassLLM\uc740 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc778\uae30 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0, \uae30\uc874 \uacbd\ub85c\uac00 \uc5c6\uc744 \uacbd\uc6b0 \uc0c8 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\uc81c \ubc0f \ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c CompassLLM\uc740 SEARCH\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uace0, GENERATE\uc5d0\uc11c \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ube44\uc6a9 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "CompassLLM\uc740 \uc9c0\ub9ac\uc801 \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud65c\uc6a9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc778\uae30 \uacbd\ub85c \ucffc\ub9ac - \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801 \uada4\uc801 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uc704\uce58 \uac04\uc758 \uac00\uc7a5 \uc790\uc8fc \uc774\ub3d9\ud55c \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ub3c4\uc2dc \uacc4\ud68d, \ub0b4\ube44\uac8c\uc774\uc158 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubc0f \uc5ec\ud589 \ucd94\ucc9c\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc744 \uac16\ub294\ub2e4. \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uacfc \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \uc774 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\uacf5\uc744 \uac70\ub450\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378 \ud559\uc2b5, \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \uc870\uc815 \ubc0f \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8 \uc218\uc6a9 \uc2dc \uc7ac\ud559\uc2b5\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc774 \uacf5\uac04 \ubc0f \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uae30\ubc18 \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0\uc11c \uc810\ucc28 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90c\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc9c0\ub9ac \uacf5\uac04 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \uad00\uc2ec\uc774 \ucee4\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 CompassLLM\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.

However, it remains\nunclear how should learners optimally incorporate certain forms of expert data,\nwhich may differ in structure from the learner's own action-outcome\nexperiences. We study this problem in the context of Bayesian multi-armed\nbandits, considering: (i) offline settings, where the learner receives a\ndataset of outcomes from the expert's optimal policy before interaction, and\n(ii) simultaneous settings, where the learner must choose at each step whether\nto update its beliefs based on its own experience, or based on the outcome\nsimultaneously achieved by an expert. We formalize how expert data influences\nthe learner's posterior, and prove that pretraining on expert outcomes tightens\ninformation-theoretic regret bounds by the mutual information between the\nexpert data and the optimal action. For the simultaneous setting, we propose an\ninformation-directed rule where the learner processes the data source that\nmaximizes their one-step information gain about the optimal action. Finally, we\npropose strategies for how the learner can infer when to trust the expert and\nwhen not to, safeguarding the learner for the cases where the expert is\nineffective or compromised.

As these deployments scale, multi-agent\ninteractions become inevitable, making it essential to understand strategic\nbehavior in such systems. A central open question is whether LLM agents, like\nreinforcement learning agents, can shape the learning dynamics and influence\nthe behavior of others through interaction alone. In this paper, we present the\nfirst investigation of opponent shaping (OS) with LLM-based agents. Existing OS\nalgorithms cannot be directly applied to LLMs, as they require higher-order\nderivatives, face scalability constraints, or depend on architectural\ncomponents that are absent in transformers. To address this gap, we introduce\nShapeLLM, an adaptation of model-free OS methods tailored for transformer-based\nagents. Using ShapeLLM, we examine whether LLM agents can influence co-players'\nlearning dynamics across diverse game-theoretic environments. We demonstrate\nthat LLM agents can successfully guide opponents toward exploitable equilibria\nin competitive games (Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, Matching Pennies, and\nChicken) and promote coordination and improve collective welfare in cooperative\ngames (Iterated Stag Hunt and a cooperative version of the Prisoner's Dilemma).\nOur findings show that LLM agents can both shape and be shaped through\ninteraction, establishing opponent shaping as a key dimension of multi-agent\nLLM research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\ub4e4\uc774 \uc790\uc728

However,\nthey frequently underperform single-agent baselines due to edge-level error\ncascades: minor inaccuracies at one message handoff propagate across the entire\nchain. We propose AgentAsk, a lightweight and plug-and-play clarification\nmodule that treats every inter-agent message as a potential failure point and\ninserts minimally necessary questions to arrest error propagation. AgentAsk\nfollows a three-stage pipeline: (i) distilling edge-level judgments from\ncurated failure traces into a compact policy, (ii) supervising the policy to\ndetermine when/what/whom/how to ask, and (iii) optimizing online with E-GRPO, a\nreinforcement learning objective that balances accuracy, latency, and cost. The\nmodule is architecture-agnostic and easy to integrate into existing\norchestration. Across math, reasoning, and coding benchmarks, AgentAsk\nconsistently improves accuracy and robustness over public multi-agent\nimplementations while keeping overhead minimal, with latency and extra cost all\nless than 5%, approaching the performance of a strong evaluator. Beyond\nempirical improvements, we contribute a principled taxonomy of edge-level\nerrors and a practical recipe for link-local intervention, offering a scalable\npathway toward more reliable LLM-based multi-agent systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "AgentAsk\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc624\ub958 \uc804\ud30c\ub97c \ubc29\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uacbd\ub7c9 \ubaa8\ub4c8\ub85c, \ud3b8\ub9ac\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ud611\uc5c5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\uc900\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc800\ud558\ub418\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "AgentAsk\ub294 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0\ub97c \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801\uc778 \uc2e4\ud328 \uc9c0\uc810\uc73c\ub85c \uac04\uc8fc\ud558\uace0, \uc624\ub958 \uc804\ud30c\ub97c \uc5b5\uc81c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud55c\uc758 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \uc0bd\uc785\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ub7c9 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc740 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4: (i) \uc2e4\ud328 \ucd94\uc801\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130\uc758 \ud310\ub2e8\uc744 \uc815\ucc45\uc73c\ub85c \uc555\ucd95\ud558\uace0, (ii) \uc5b8\uc81c, \ubb34\uc5c7\uc744, \ub204\uad6c\uc5d0\uac8c, \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ubb3c\uc5b4\ubcfc\uc9c0\ub97c \uacb0\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc815\ucc45 \uac10\ub3c5, (iii) \uc815\ud655\uc131, \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc2dc\uac04 \ubc0f \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa9\ud45c E-GRPO\ub85c \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654.", "result": "AgentAsk\ub294 \uc218\ud559, \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \ucf54\ub529 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uacf5\uacf5 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uad6c\ud604\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\ud655\uc131\uacfc \uac15\uc778\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba74\uc11c \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c \ucd5c\uc18c\ud55c\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ub118\uc5b4, \uc5d0\uc9c0 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc624\ub958\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801 \ubd84\ub958\uc640 \ub9c1\ud06c \ub85c\uceec \uac1c\uc785\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \ub808\uc2dc\ud53c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc5ec \ub354\uc6b1 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\uc544\uac08 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ud611\uc5c5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0 \ub2a5\ub825 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uc57d\uc18d\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0 \uc804\ud658 \uc9c0\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc791\uc740 \ubd80\uc815\ud655\uc131\uc774 \uc804\uccb4 \uccb4\uc778\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc804\ud30c\ub418\uba70 \uc885\uc885 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\uc900\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ub0ae\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac01 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0\ub97c \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \uc2e4\ud328 \uc9c0\uc810\uc73c\ub85c \uac04\uc8fc\ud558\uace0 \uc624\ub958 \uc804\ud30c\ub97c \uc5b5\uc81c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud55c\uc758 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \uc0bd\uc785\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ub7c9\uc774\uace0 \ud50c\ub7ec\uadf8 \uc564 \ud50c\ub808\uc774 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \uba85\ud655\ud654 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc778 AgentAsk\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Existing\napproaches typically extract content from a large collection of related papers\nand prompt LLMs to summarize them directly. However, such methods often\noverlook the structural relationships among papers, resulting in generated\nsurveys that lack a coherent taxonomy and a deeper contextual understanding of\nresearch progress. To address these shortcomings, we propose \\textbf{SurveyG},\nan LLM-based agent framework that integrates \\textit{hierarchical citation\ngraph}, where nodes denote research papers and edges capture both citation\ndependencies and semantic relatedness between their contents, thereby embedding\nstructural and contextual knowledge into the survey generation process.

To\naddress this, we introduce the \"Haibu Mathematical-Medical Intelligent Agent\"\n(MMIA), an LLM-driven architecture that ensures reliability through a formally\nverifiable reasoning process. MMIA recursively breaks down complex medical\ntasks into atomic, evidence-based steps. This entire reasoning chain is then\nautomatically audited for logical coherence and evidence traceability, similar\nto theorem proving. A key innovation is MMIA's \"bootstrapping\" mode, which\nstores validated reasoning chains as \"theorems.\" Subsequent tasks can then be\nefficiently solved using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), shifting from\ncostly first-principles reasoning to a low-cost verification model. We\nvalidated MMIA across four healthcare administration domains, including DRG/DIP\naudits and medical insurance adjudication, using expert-validated benchmarks.\nResults showed MMIA achieved an error detection rate exceeding 98% with a false\npositive rate below 1%, significantly outperforming baseline LLMs. Furthermore,\nthe RAG matching mode is projected to reduce average processing costs by\napproximately 85% as the knowledge base matures. In conclusion, MMIA's\nverifiable reasoning framework is a significant step toward creating\ntrustworthy, transparent, and cost-effective AI systems, making LLM technology\nviable for critical applications in medicine.", "AI": {"tldr": "MMIA\ub294 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574 LLM\uc774 \ub4dc\ub77c\uc774\ube0c\ud558\ub294 \uc218\ud559\uc801-\uc758\ub8cc \uc9c0\ub2a5 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c, \uc758\ud559 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \uc904\uc774\ub294 \ud601\uc2e0\uc801\uc778 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc758\ud559 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc0ac\uc2e4\uc801 \ubc0f \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uace0\uc548\ub428.", "method": "MMIA\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc758\ub8cc \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uadfc\uac70 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\uace0, \uc774 \uacfc\uc815\uc758 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ucd94\ub860 \uccb4\uc778\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uac10\uc0ac\ud558\uc5ec \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uacfc \uc99d\uac70 \ucd94\uc801\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "MMIA\ub294 98% \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uc624\ub958 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uc728\uacfc 1% \ubbf8\ub9cc\uc758 \uac00\uc9dc \uae0d\uc815\ub960\uc744 \uae30\ub85d\ud558\uba70, \uae30\uc874 LLM\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "MMIA\uc758 \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uccb4\uacc4\uac00 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uace0 \ud22c\uba85\ud558\uba70 \ube44\uc6a9 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uac1c\ubc1c\uc758 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc9c4\uc804\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \uc758\ud559 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\ub9dd\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc0ac\uc2e4\uc801 \ubc0f \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc624\ub958\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 \uace0\uc704\ud5d8 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc6a9\ub0a9\ub420 \uc218 \uc5c6\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uacf5\uc2dd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc778 \"\ud558\uc774\ubd80 \uc218\ud559-\uc758\ub8cc \uc9c0\ub2a5 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\"(MMIA)\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

To investigate this tension, we\nformulate a PursuitEvasion-Exposure-Concealment Game (PEEC) in which a pursuer\nagent must decide when to communicate in order to obtain the evader's position.\nEach communication reveals the pursuer's location, increasing the risk of being\ntargeted. Both agents learn their movement policies via reinforcement learning,\nwhile the pursuer additionally learns a communication policy that balances\nobservability and risk. We propose SHADOW (Strategic-communication Hybrid\nAction Decision-making under partial Observation for Warfare), a multi-headed\nsequential reinforcement learning framework that integrates continuous\nnavigation control, discrete communication actions, and opponent modeling for\nbehavior prediction.

At the\nheart of this shift is multi-vehicle dynamic navigation, which requires\nsimultaneously routing large fleets under evolving traffic conditions. Existing\npath search algorithms and reinforcement learning methods struggle to scale to\ncity-wide networks, often failing to capture the nonlinear, stochastic, and\ncoupled dynamics of urban traffic. To address these challenges, we propose\nCityNav, a hierarchical, LLM-powered framework for large-scale multi-vehicle\nnavigation. CityNav integrates a global traffic allocation agent, which\ncoordinates strategic traffic flow distribution across regions, with local\nnavigation agents that generate locally adaptive routes aligned with global\ndirectives. To enable effective cooperation, we introduce a cooperative\nreasoning optimization mechanism, in which agents are jointly trained with a\ndual-reward structure: individual rewards promote per-vehicle efficiency, while\nshared rewards encourage network-wide coordination and congestion reduction.\nExtensive experiments on four real-world road networks of varying scales (up to\n1.6 million roads and 430,000 intersections) and traffic datasets demonstrate\nthat CityNav consistently outperforms nine classical path search and RL-based\nbaselines in city-scale travel efficiency and congestion mitigation. Our\nresults highlight the potential of LLMs to enable scalable, adaptive, and\ncooperative city-wide traffic navigation, providing a foundation for\nintelligent, large-scale vehicle routing in complex urban environments.

Inspired by the way human analysts visually inspect time\nseries to uncover hidden patterns, we ask: can incorporating visual\nrepresentations enhance automated time-series analysis? Recent advances in\nmultimodal large language models have demonstrated impressive generalization\nand visual understanding capability, yet their application to time series\nremains constrained by the modality gap between continuous numerical data and\ndiscrete natural language. To bridge this gap, we introduce MLLM4TS, a novel\nframework that leverages multimodal large language models for general\ntime-series analysis by integrating a dedicated vision branch. Each time-series\nchannel is rendered as a horizontally stacked color-coded line plot in one\ncomposite image to capture spatial dependencies across channels, and a\ntemporal-aware visual patch alignment strategy then aligns visual patches with\ntheir corresponding time segments. MLLM4TS fuses fine-grained temporal details\nfrom the numerical data with global contextual information derived from the\nvisual representation, providing a unified foundation for multimodal\ntime-series analysis.

A lightweight student agent then\nrefines the graph and fine tune on high confidence causal associations that are\nencoded as rich textual prompts to perform forecasting.

Conventional approaches for sleep scoring rely\non manual annotation or features extracted from EEG signals in the time or\nfrequency domain. This study proposes a novel framework for automated sleep\nstage scoring using time-frequency analysis based on the wavelet transform. The\nSleep-EDF Expanded Database (sleep-cassette recordings) was used for\nevaluation. The continuous wavelet transform (CWT) generated time-frequency\nmaps that capture both transient and oscillatory patterns across frequency\nbands relevant to sleep staging. Experimental results demonstrate that the\nproposed wavelet-based representation, combined with ensemble learning,\nachieves an overall accuracy of 88.37 percent and a macro-averaged F1 score of\n73.15, outperforming conventional machine learning methods and exhibiting\ncomparable or superior performance to recent deep learning approaches.

However, evaluating these systems remains critically challenging\ndue to open-ended research scenarios and existing benchmarks that focus on\nisolated capabilities rather than holistic performance. Unlike traditional LLM\ntasks, DeepResearch systems must synthesize diverse sources, generate insights,\nand present coherent findings, which are capabilities that resist simple\nverification. To address this gap, we introduce DeepResearch-ReportEval, a\ncomprehensive framework designed to assess DeepResearch systems through their\nmost representative outputs: research reports. Our approach systematically\nmeasures three dimensions: quality, redundancy, and factuality, using an\ninnovative LLM-as-a-Judge methodology achieving strong expert concordance. We\ncontribute a standardized benchmark of 100 curated queries spanning 12\nreal-world categories, enabling systematic capability comparison. Our\nevaluation of four leading commercial systems reveals distinct design\nphilosophies and performance trade-offs, establishing foundational insights as\nDeepResearch evolves from information assistants toward intelligent research\npartners.

However,\ncurrent approaches still struggle with complex, long-horizon sequential\ndecision making. In this work, we introduce DEtached value learning with Action\nSequence (DEAS), a simple yet effective offline RL framework that leverages\naction sequences for value learning. These temporally extended actions provide\nricher information than single-step actions and can be interpreted through the\noptions framework via semi-Markov decision process Q-learning, enabling\nreduction of the effective planning horizon by considering longer sequences at\nonce. However, directly adopting such sequences in actor-critic algorithms\nintroduces excessive value overestimation, which we address through detached\nvalue learning that steers value estimates toward in-distribution actions that\nachieve high return in the offline dataset.

In practice,\ngathering large sets of data is inefficient, and training on them is\nprohibitively expensive; worse, there is no guarantee that the resulting model\nwill handle complex scenarios or generalize better. Moreover, existing\ntechniques rarely assess whether a training sample provides novel information\nor is redundant with the knowledge already acquired by the model, resulting in\nunnecessary costs. In this work, we explore a new test-time self-improvement\nmethod to create more effective and generalizable agentic LMs on-the-fly. The\nproposed algorithm can be summarized in three steps: (i) first it identifies\nthe samples that model struggles with (self-awareness), (ii) then generates\nsimilar examples from detected uncertain samples (self-data augmentation), and\n(iii) uses these newly generated samples at test-time fine-tuning\n(self-improvement). We study two variants of this approach: Test-Time\nSelf-Improvement (TT-SI), where the same model generates additional training\nexamples from its own uncertain cases and then learns from them, and contrast\nthis approach with Test-Time Distillation (TT-D), where a stronger model\ngenerates similar examples for uncertain cases, enabling student to adapt using\ndistilled supervision. Empirical evaluations across different agent benchmarks\ndemonstrate that TT-SI improves the performance with +5.48% absolute accuracy\ngain on average across all benchmarks and surpasses other standard learning\nmethods, yet using 68x less training samples. Our findings highlight the\npromise of TT-SI, demonstrating the potential of self-improvement algorithms at\ntest-time as a new paradigm for building more capable agents toward\nself-evolution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc790\uac00 \uac1c\uc120(TT-SI) \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \ub192\uc740 \ube44\uc6a9 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6cc\ud558\ub294 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub4e4\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uc608\uc81c\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \ud574\ub2f9 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud574 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "TT-SI\uac00 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uade0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c +5.48%\uc758 \uc808\ub300 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uac00\uc838\uc624\uba70, \ub2e4\ub978 \ud45c\uc900 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 68\ubc30 \uc801\uc740 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "TT-SI\ub294 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc790\uac00 \uac1c\uc120 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \uc720\ub9dd\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70, \uc790\uac00 \uc9c4\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LM) \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc758 \ud55c \uac00\uc9c0 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc740 \ub300\ub7c9\uc758 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec, \ub192\uc740 \uc591\uacfc \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uc774 \uc0ac\ud6c4 \ud6c8\ub828 \ud6c4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac00\uc815 \ud558\uc5d0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc2e4\uc81c\ub85c \ub300\ub7c9\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc218\uc9d1\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ub192\ub2e4. \uac8c\ub2e4\uac00, \uacb0\uacfc \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub97c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ub354 \uc798 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ud560 \uac83\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc740 \uc5c6\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uae30\uc874 \uae30\uc220\uc740 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc774\ubbf8 \uc2b5\ub4dd\ud55c \uc9c0\uc2dd\uacfc \uc911\ubcf5\ub418\ub294\uc9c0 \ub610\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc544 \ubd88\ud544\uc694\ud55c \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc989\uc11d\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 LM\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc790\uac00 \uac1c\uc120 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \uc138 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub85c \uc694\uc57d\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4: (i) \uba3c\uc800 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\ub294 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0(\uc790\uae30 \uc778\uc2dd), (ii) \uadf8\ub7f0 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud55c \uc0d8\ud50c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uc608\uc81c\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uba70(\uc790\uae30 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc99d\uac15), (iii) \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uac04 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774 \uc0c8\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294(\uc790\uac00 \uac1c\uc120) \ubc29\ubc95\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc758 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubcc0\ud615\uc778 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc790\uac00 \uac1c\uc120(TT-SI)\uacfc \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc99d\ub958(TT-D)\ub97c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4.

However, exist mobile GUI agents\npredominantly privilege autonomous operation and neglect the necessity of\nactive user engagement during task execution. This omission undermines their\nadaptability to information dilemmas including ambiguous, dynamically evolving,\nand conflicting task scenarios, leading to execution outcomes that deviate from\ngenuine user requirements and preferences. To address these shortcomings, we\npropose ReInAgent, a context-aware multi-agent framework that leverages dynamic\ninformation management to enable human-in-the-loop mobile task navigation.\nReInAgent integrates three specialized agents around a shared memory module: an\ninformation-managing agent for slot-based information management and proactive\ninteraction with the user, a decision-making agent for conflict-aware planning,\nand a reflecting agent for task reflection and information consistency\nvalidation. Through continuous contextual information analysis and sustained\nuser-agent collaboration, ReInAgent overcomes the limitation of existing\napproaches that rely on clear and static task assumptions.

Among numerous PEFT strategies, Low-Rank\nAdaptation (LoRA) has emerged as one of the most widely adopted approaches due\nto its robust empirical performance and low implementation complexity. In\npractical deployment, LoRA is typically applied to the $W^Q$ and $W^V$\nprojection matrices of self-attention modules, enabling an effective trade-off\nbetween model performance and parameter efficiency. While LoRA has achieved\nconsiderable empirical success, it still encounters challenges such as\nsuboptimal performance and slow convergence. To address these limitations, we\nintroduce \\textbf{AILoRA}, a novel parameter-efficient method that incorporates\nfunction-aware asymmetric low-rank priors. Our empirical analysis reveals that\nthe projection matrices $W^Q$ and $W^V$ in the self-attention mechanism exhibit\ndistinct parameter characteristics, stemming from their functional differences.\nSpecifically, $W^Q$ captures task-specific semantic space knowledge essential\nfor attention distributions computation, making its parameters highly sensitive\nto downstream task variations.

While distributed UMDA methods address\nprivacy constraints by avoiding raw data sharing, existing approaches typically\nassume a small number of sources and fail to scale effectively. Increasing the\nnumber of heterogeneous domains often makes existing methods impractical,\nleading to high computational overhead or unstable performance. We propose\nGALA, a scalable and robust federated UMDA framework that introduces two key\ncomponents: (1) a novel inter-group discrepancy minimization objective that\nefficiently approximates full pairwise domain alignment without quadratic\ncomputation; and (2) a temperature-controlled, centroid-based weighting\nstrategy that dynamically prioritizes source domains based on alignment with\nthe target. Together, these components enable stable and parallelizable\ntraining across large numbers of heterogeneous sources.

However, quality is a domain-dependent and dynamic concept,\nmaking its assessment a formidable challenge. Traditional methods relying on\nhand-crafted features are unscalable across domains and fail to adapt to\nevolving content patterns, while modern deep learning approaches often produce\nblack-box models that lack interpretability and may prioritize semantics over\nquality. To address these challenges, we propose AutoQual, an LLM-based agent\nframework that automates the discovery of interpretable features. While\ndemonstrated on review quality assessment, AutoQual is designed as a general\nframework for transforming tacit knowledge embedded in data into explicit,\ncomputable features. It mimics a human research process, iteratively generating\nfeature hypotheses through reflection, operationalizing them via autonomous\ntool implementation, and accumulating experience in a persistent memory. We\ndeploy our method on a large-scale online platform with a billion-level user\nbase. Large-scale A/B testing confirms its effectiveness, increasing average\nreviews viewed per user by 0.79% and the conversion rate of review readers by\n0.27%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8

Recent research has\ndemonstrated the feasibility of leveraging Wi-Fi signals for passive person\nidentification using a person's unique gait pattern. Although most existing\nwork focuses on sub-6 GHz frequencies, the emergence of mmWave offers new\nopportunities through its finer spatial resolution, though its comparative\nadvantages for person identification remain unexplored. This work presents the\nfirst comparative study between sub-6 GHz and mmWave Wi-Fi signals for person\nidentification with commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) Wi-Fi, using a novel\ndataset of synchronized measurements from the two frequency bands in an indoor\nenvironment. To ensure a fair comparison, we apply identical training pipelines\nand model configurations across both frequency bands.

Non-Autoregressive (NAR) models offer holistic,\nbidirectional representations but face challenges with generative coherence and\nscalability. To transcend this, we propose a hybrid framework enhancing AR\ngeneration by dynamically integrating rich contextual information from\nnon-autoregressive mechanisms. Our approach couples a shared input encoder with\ntwo decoders: a non-autoregressive one learning latent bidirectional biological\nfeatures, and an AR decoder synthesizing the biological sequence by leveraging\nthese bidirectional features. A novel cross-decoder attention module enables\nthe AR decoder to iteratively query and integrate these bidirectional features,\nenriching its predictions. This synergy is cultivated via a tailored training\nstrategy with importance annealing for balanced objectives and cross-decoder\ngradient blocking for stable, focused learning. Evaluations on a demanding\nnine-species benchmark of de novo peptide sequencing show that our model\nsubstantially surpasses AR and NAR baselines. It uniquely harmonizes AR\nstability with NAR contextual awareness, delivering robust, superior\nperformance on diverse downstream data. This research advances biological\nsequence modeling techniques and contributes a novel architectural paradigm for\naugmenting AR models with enhanced bidirectional understanding for complex\nsequence generation.

Contemporary approaches offer two inadequate\nsolutions: lightweight instruct models achieve sub-second latency but lack\nreasoning depth, while tool-augmented ReAct agents enhance factuality through\nexternal knowledge at the cost of synchronous execution that blocks interaction\nduring retrieval processes. PMFR is thus proposed, with a temporal decoupling\nframework that fundamentally resolves the contradiction through asynchronous\nknowledge orchestration. PMFR employs three coordinated components: (1) a\nKnowledge Adequacy Evaluator for real-time sufficiency assessment, (2) a\nLightweight Response Generator for immediate user interaction, and (3) an\nAsynchronous Knowledge Refinement Agent for background knowledge enhancement.\nThis architecture maintains continuous conversational flow while progressively\nenriching knowledge coverage through intelligent triggering mechanisms.\nEvaluation results on TopiOCQA demonstrate PMFR outperforms brute-force\nscaling: PMFR achieves 95.3% latency reduction (23.38s -> 1.09s) while\npreserving response quality comparable to heavyweight synchronous baselines\n(GEval-C: 0.613 vs. 0.620).", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 PMFR\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub300\ud654 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \ube44\ub3d9\uae30 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc870\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc9c0\uc5f0-\ud488\uc9c8 \uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\ucda9 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0, \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud654\ud615 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c0\uc5f0-\ud488\uc9c8 \uac04\uc758 \uad50\ud658\uc740 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\uba70, \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ubaa8\ub450 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "PMFR\uc740 \ube44\ub3d9\uae30 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc870\uc815 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc9c0\uc2dd \ud3c9\uac00, \uc989\uac01\uc801\uc778 \uc751\ub2f5 \uc0dd\uc131, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \ubc31\uadf8\ub77c\uc6b4\ub4dc \uc9c0\uc2dd \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud3c9\uac00 \uacb0\uacfc\uc5d0 \ub530\ub974\uba74 PMFR\uc740 \ube0c\ub8e8\ud2b8 \ud3ec\uc2a4 \ud655\uc7a5\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud558\uba70, 95.3%\uc758 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uac10\uc18c\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc751\ub2f5 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "PMFR\uc740 \uc9c0\uc2dd \ubc94\uc704\ub97c \uc810\uc9c4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uace0, \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ub300\ud654 \ud750\ub984\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ub300\ud654 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc9c0\uc5f0-\ud488\uc9c8 \ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ub4dc\uc624\ud504\ub294 \uc624\ud508 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ub300\ud654 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uc81c\uc57d \uc0ac\ud56d\uc73c\ub85c, \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc811\uadfc\uc740 \uae08\uc9c0\uc801\uc778 \uc751\ub2f5 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc744 \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud55c\ub2e4. \ud604\ub300\uc801 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubd88\uc644\uc804\ud55c \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4: \uacbd\ub7c9 \uc9c0\uce68 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 1\ucd08 \ubbf8\ub9cc\uc758 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ucd94\ub860 \uae4a\uc774\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uace0, \ub3c4\uad6c \ubcf4\uac15 ReAct \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uac80\uc0c9 \uacfc\uc815 \uc911 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ucc28\ub2e8\ud558\ub294 \ub3d9\uae30\uc2dd \uc2e4\ud589\uc758 \ub300\uac00\ub85c \uc678\ubd80 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc0ac\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c PMFR\uc774 \uc81c\uc548\ub418\uba70, \ube44\ub3d9\uae30 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc870\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\uc21c\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \uc2dc\uac04 \ubd84\ub9ac \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.

This paper presents a novel\nperspective: instead of primarily developing new complex techniques from\nscratch, we explore synergistically leveraging well-established, individually\n'weak' auxiliary models - specialized for tackling either class imbalance or\nlabel noise but not both. This view is motivated by the insight that class\nimbalance (a distributional-level concern) and label noise (a sample-level\nconcern) operate at different granularities, suggesting that robustness\nmechanisms for each can in principle offer complementary strengths without\nconflict. We propose Dual-granularity Sinkhorn Distillation (D-SINK), a novel\nframework that enhances dual robustness by distilling and integrating\ncomplementary insights from such 'weak', single-purpose auxiliary models.\nSpecifically, D-SINK uses an optimal transport-optimized surrogate label\nallocation to align the target model's sample-level predictions with a\nnoise-robust auxiliary and its class distributions with an imbalance-robust\none. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that D-SINK\nsignificantly improves robustness and achieves strong empirical performance in\nlearning from long-tailed noisy data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4 \ubd88\uade0\ud615\uacfc \ub808\uc774\ube14 \ub178\uc74c\uc774 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa8\ub378 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud074\ub798\uc2a4 \ubd88\uade0\ud615\uacfc \ub808\uc774\ube14 \ub178\uc74c\uc740 \uac01\uac01 \ub2e4\ub978 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c, \uc11c\ub85c \ubcf4\uc644\uc801\uc778 \uac15\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "D-SINK\ub294 '\uc57d\ud55c' \ubcf4\uc870 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc0c1\ud638 \ubcf4\uc644\uc801\uc778 \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \uc99d\ub958\ud558\uace0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\uc911 \uac15\uc778\uc131\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "result": "D-SINK\ub294 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\uc778\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0, \uae34 \uaf2c\ub9ac\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \ub178\uc774\uc988 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4 \ubd88\uade0\ud615\uacfc \ub808\uc774\ube14 \ub178\uc74c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uad00\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub525 \ub7ec\ub2dd\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4 \ubd88\uade0\ud615\uacfc \ub808\uc774\ube14 \ub178\uc74c\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc800\ud558\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac01 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub4e4\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uacb0\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ube44 trivial \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc65c\ub0d0\ud558\uba74 \uc9c4\uc815\ud55c \uaf2c\ub9ac \uc0d8\ud50c\uacfc \ub178\uc774\uc988 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uad6c\ubd84\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc5b4\ub835\uace0, \uc885\uc885 \uc0c1\ucda9\ud558\ub294 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc804\ub7b5\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc9c0\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uae30\uc220\uc744 \ucc98\uc74c\ubd80\ud130 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\ub294 \ub300\uc2e0, \ud074\ub798\uc2a4 \ubd88\uade0\ud615\uc774\ub098 \ub808\uc774\ube14 \ub178\uc74c \uc911 \ud558\ub098\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc804\ubb38\ud654\ub41c '\uc57d\ud55c' \ubcf4\uc870 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc2dc\ub108\uc9c0 \uc788\uac8c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud074\ub798\uc2a4 \ubd88\uade0\ud615(\ubc30\uae09 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c)\uacfc \ub808\uc774\ube14 \ub178\uc74c(\uc0d8\ud50c \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c)\uc740 \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \uc138\ubd84\ud654 \uc218\uc900\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\ub294 \uc778\uc0ac\uc774\ud2b8\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ub3d9\uae30\uac00 \ubd80\uc5ec\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c '\uc57d\ud55c' \ub2e8\uc77c \uc6a9\ub3c4\uc758 \ubcf4\uc870 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc0c1\ud638 \ubcf4\uc644\uc801\uc778 \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\uace0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\uc911 \uac15\uc778\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 D-SINK(\uc774\uc911 \uc138\ubd84\ud654 \uc2f1\ud06c\ud63c \uc99d\ub958)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c D-SINK\ub294 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uc6b4\uc1a1 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub41c \ub300\uccb4 \ub808\uc774\ube14 \ubd84\ubc30\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa9\ud45c \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc0d8\ud50c \ub808\ubca8 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \ub178\uc774\uc988\uc5d0 \uac15\ud55c \ubcf4\uc870 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uc815\ub82c\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0, \ud074\ub798\uc2a4 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \ubd88\uade0\ud615\uc5d0 \uac15\ud55c \ubcf4\uc870 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uc77c\uce58\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc740 D-SINK\uac00 \uac15\uc778\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uae34 \uaf2c\ub9ac\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \ub178\uc774\uc988 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, RL has yet to be fully leveraged in robotics,\nprincipally due to its lack of scalability. Offline RL offers a promising\navenue by training agents on large, diverse datasets, avoiding the costly\nreal-world interactions of online RL. Scaling offline RL to increasingly\ncomplex datasets requires expressive generative models such as diffusion and\nflow matching. However, existing methods typically depend on either\nbackpropagation through time (BPTT), which is computationally prohibitive, or\npolicy distillation, which introduces compounding errors and limits scalability\nto larger base policies. In this paper, we consider the question of how to\ndevelop a scalable offline RL approach without relying on distillation or\nbackpropagation through time. We introduce Expressive Value Learning for\nOffline Reinforcement Learning (EVOR): a scalable offline RL approach that\nintegrates both expressive policies and expressive value functions. EVOR learns\nan optimal, regularized Q-function via flow matching during training. At\ninference-time, EVOR performs inference-time policy extraction via rejection\nsampling against the expressive value function, enabling efficient\noptimization, regularization, and compute-scalable search without retraining.\nEmpirically, we show that EVOR outperforms baselines on a diverse set of\noffline RL tasks, demonstrating the benefit of integrating expressive value\nlearning into offline

In this\nwork, we reveal the security and robustness vulnerabilities of these agents\nthrough backdoor attacks. Distinct from traditional backdoors limited to\nsingle-step control, we propose the Chain-of-Trigger Backdoor (CoTri), a\nmulti-step backdoor attack designed for long-horizon agentic control. CoTri\nrelies on an ordered sequence. It starts with an initial trigger, and\nsubsequent ones are drawn from the environment, allowing multi-step\nmanipulation that diverts the agent from its intended task. Experimental\nresults show that CoTri achieves a near-perfect attack success rate (ASR) while\nmaintaining a near-zero false trigger rate (FTR). Due to training data modeling\nthe stochastic nature of the environment, the implantation of CoTri\nparadoxically enhances the agent's performance on benign tasks and even\nimproves its robustness against environmental distractions. We further validate\nCoTri on vision-language models (VLMs), confirming its scalability to\nmultimodal agents. Our work highlights that CoTri achieves stable, multi-step\ncontrol within agents, improving their inherent robustness and task\ncapabilities, which ultimately makes the attack more stealthy and raises\npotential safty risks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b4\uace0, \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ubc31\ub3c4\uc5b4 \uacf5\uaca9\uc778 CoTri\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf4\uc548 \ubc0f \uac15\uac74\uc131 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2e4\uc81c \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ube60\ub978 \ubc30\uce58\ub294 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \uc6b0\ub824\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "CoTri\ub294 \ucd08\uae30 \ud2b8\ub9ac\uac70\ub85c \uc2dc\uc791\ud558\uc5ec \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd94\ucd9c\ub41c \ud6c4\uc18d \ud2b8\ub9ac\uac70\ub85c \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc870\uc791\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ubc31\ub3c4\uc5b4 \uacf5\uaca9\uc774\ub2e4.", "result": "CoTri\ub294 \uac70\uc758 \uc644\ubcbd\ud55c \uacf5\uaca9 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uacfc \uac70\uc758 0\uc758 \ud5c8\uc704 \ud2b8\ub9ac\uac70 \ube44\uc728\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "CoTri\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uac15\uac74\uc131\uacfc \uc791\uc5c5 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uba70, \uacf5\uaca9\uc758 \uc740\ubc00\uc131\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ucf1c \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801\uc778 \uc548\uc804 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ube60\ub978 \ubc30\uce58\ub294 \uadf8 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \uc6b0\ub824\ub97c \uc57c\uae30\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548 \ubc0f \uac15\uac74\uc131 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \ubc31\ub3c4\uc5b4 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ubc31\ub3c4\uc5b4\uac00 \ub2e8\uc77c \ub2e8\uacc4 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub85c \uc81c\ud55c\ub418\ub294 \uac83\uacfc\ub294 \ub2ec\ub9ac, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc7a5\uae30\uc801\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ubc31\ub3c4\uc5b4 \uacf5\uaca9\uc778 Chain-of-Trigger Backdoor (CoTri)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Yu"], "title": "Reinforcement Learning from Probabilistic Forecasts for Safe Decision-Making via Conditional Value-at-Risk Planning", "comment": null, "summary": "Sequential decisions in volatile, high-stakes settings require more than\nmaximizing expected return; they require principled uncertainty management.\nThis paper presents the Uncertainty-Aware Markov Decision Process (UAMDP), a\nunified framework that couples Bayesian forecasting, posterior-sampling\nreinforcement learning, and planning under a conditional value-at-risk (CVaR)\nconstraint. In a closed loop, the agent updates its beliefs over latent\ndynamics, samples plausible futures via Thompson sampling, and optimizes\npolicies subject to preset risk tolerances. We establish regret bounds that\nconverge to the Bayes-optimal benchmark under standard regularity conditions.\nWe evaluate UAMDP in two domains-high-frequency equity trading and retail\ninventory control-both marked by structural uncertainty and economic\nvolatility. Relative to strong deep learning baselines, UAMDP improves\nlong-horizon forecasting accuracy (RMSE decreases by up to 25\\% and sMAPE by\n32\\%), and these gains translate into economic performance: the trading Sharpe\nratio rises from 1.54 to 1.74 while maximum drawdown is roughly halved. These\nresults show that integrating calibrated probabilistic modeling, exploration\naligned with posterior uncertainty, and risk-aware control yields a robust,\ngeneralizable approach to safer and more profitable sequential decision-making.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uad00\ub9ac\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uace0\uc704\ud5d8 \uacb0\uc815 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud55c \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uacb0\uc815 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4(UAMDP)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

We have designed and\nproposed a layered solution composed of three core protocols: the Human-Agent\nInteraction Protocol (HAI), the Unified Agent Protocol (UAP), and the\nMemory-Extraction-Knowledge Protocol (MEK). HAI focuses on the interaction\nlayer, standardizing the flow of information between users, interfaces, and\nagents by defining a standardized, event-driven communication paradigm. This\nensures the real-time performance, reliability, and synergy of interactions. As\nthe core of the infrastructure layer, UAP is designed to break down\ncommunication barriers among heterogeneous agents through unified service\ndiscovery and protocol conversion mechanisms, thereby enabling seamless\ninterconnection and interoperability of the underlying network. MEK, in turn,\noperates at the cognitive layer. By establishing a standardized ''Memory (M) -\nExtraction (E) - Knowledge (K)'' cognitive chain, it empowers agents with the\nability to learn from individual experiences and form shareable knowledge,\nthereby laying the foundation for the realization of true collective\nintelligence. We believe this protocol framework will provide a solid\nengineering foundation and theoretical guidance for building the next\ngeneration of efficient, scalable, and intelligent multi-agent applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc6b4\uc6a9\uc131, \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ubc0f \ud611\uc5c5, \uc9c0\uc2dd \uacf5\uc720\uc758 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud575\uc2ec \ucc28\uc6d0\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c Co-TAP(Triple, Agent, Protocol)\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc0bc\uce35 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "HAI, UAP \ubc0f MEK\ub77c\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud575\uc2ec \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uace0 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.

However, (1) traditional RAG struggles with complex query\nunderstanding, and (2) even search agents trained with reinforcement learning\n(RL), despite their promise, still face generalization and deployment\nchallenges. To address these limitations, we propose QAgent, a unified agentic\nRAG framework that employs a search agent for adaptive retrieval. This agent\noptimizes its understanding of the query through interactive reasoning and\nretrieval. To facilitate real-world application, we focus on modular search\nagent for query understanding that are plug-and-play in complex systems.\nSecifically, the agent follows a multi-step decision process trained with RL to\nmaximize retrieval quality and support accurate downstream answers. We further\nanalyze the strengths and weaknesses of end-to-end RL and propose a strategy\nthat focuses on effective retrieval, thereby enhancing generalization in LLM\napplications.

Trained offline\non over 11,000 ICU patients from the MIMIC-IV database, DeepEN generates\n4-hourly recommendations for caloric, protein, and fluid intake tailored to\neach patient's evolving physiology.

However, in Machine Learning Engineering (MLE) scenarios\nsuch as AutoML and Kaggle competitions, achieving high performance depends\nheavily on expert intervention and repeated adjustments rather than simply\ngenerating correct code. When applied directly to these tasks, LLMs often lack\nfine-grained domain priors, and existing MLE approaches that use linear or\ntree-structured searches limit knowledge transfer to adjacent hierarchical\nlinks. As a result, they cannot leverage past full trajectories or share\ninformation across branches, limiting self-evolving ability and search space\ndiversity. To address these limitations, we introduce AutoMLGen, an LLM-based\ncoding agent that integrates a domain knowledge base for high-quality prior\nguidance and Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS) for efficient exploration. MCGS\nretains the tree-guided exploration of MCTS while embedding a graph structure\ninto the expansion stage to enable dynamic path reorganization, historical\ntrajectory reuse, and multi-solution fusion to support both self-evolution and\ncollaborative learning. Combined with fine-grained operator sets, this design\nimproves stability and accelerates convergence. Evaluation on the MLE-Bench\nshows that AutoMLGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in numerous\ndimensions, such as the average medal rate and the valid submission rate, under\na 12-hour budget (half the standard runtime).

Visualizing the smallest sub-microscopic porosity\nvessels therefore requires the highest achievable resolution from confocal\nfluorescence microscopy, the current gold standard. This considerably limits\nthe extent of the field of view to very small sample regions. To overcome this\nlimitation, we tested different deep learning (DL) super-resolution (SR) models\nto allow faster experimental acquisitions of lower resolution images and\nrestore optimal image quality by post-processing. Three supervised 2D SR models\n(RCAN, pix2pix, FSRCNN) and one unsupervised (CycleGAN) were applied to a\nunique set of experimentally paired high- and low-resolution confocal images\nacquired with different sampling schemes, resulting in a pixel size increase of\nx2, x4, x8. Model performance was quantified using a broad set of similarity\nand distribution-based image quality assessment (IQA) metrics, which yielded\ninconsistent results that mostly contradicted our visual perception. This\nraises the question of the relevance of such generic metrics to efficiently\ntarget the specific structure of dental porosity. To resolve this conflicting\ninformation, the generated SR images were segmented taking into account the\nspecific scales and morphology of the porosity network and analysed by\ncomparing connected components. Additionally, the capacity of the SR models to\npreserve 3D porosity connectivity throughout the confocal image stacks was\nevaluated using graph analysis.

Strategic information gathering requires models to know not only how to\neffectively acquire information, but also when to stop gathering information\nand make a decision, in order to avoid overthinking or getting derailed when\nacting. In this paper, we formalize this problem and introduce Counterfactuals\nand Reasoning for Termination (CaRT), an approach for teaching LLMs when to\nstop seeking information. To appropriately learn when to terminate, CaRT\nfine-tunes LLMs using counterfactual pairs of trajectories, one where\ntermination is appropriate and a minimally modified version of the same\ntrajectory where it is not. It trains the LLM to explain the rationale for the\ntermination decision in either case via verbal reasoning, and imbues this\ncapability into the base LLM via fine-tuning. We instantiate CaRT in two\ndomains: interactive medical diagnosis and math problem solving. In both\ndomains, we find that CaRT improves the efficiency of information gathering and\ntask success rate compared to other fine-tuning methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 LLM\uc774 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc218\uc9d1\ud560 \uc2dc\uc810\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 CaRT\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc218\uc9d1\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc791\uc5c5 \uc218\ud589 \uc804 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubc88\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uad00\ub828 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc804\ub7b5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\uc9d1\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ub9ce\ub2e4.", "method": "CaRT\ub294 \uc801\uc808\ud55c \uc885\ub8cc \uc2dc\uc810\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 LLM\uc744 \ubc18\uc0ac\uc2e4\uc801 \uacbd\ub85c \uc30d\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc138\ubd80 \uc870\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c CaRT\ub294 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc218\uc9d1\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc791\uc5c5 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf30\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "CaRT\ub294 LLM\uc774 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc218\uc9d1\ud560 \uc2dc\uc810\uc744 \ud310\ub2e8\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf1c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub9ce\uc740 \uc791\uc5c5\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uae30 \uc804\uc5d0 \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ucc28\ub840\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uad00\ub828 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc804\ub7b5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\uc9d1\ud574\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc218\uc9d1\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc218\uc9d1\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uacfc\ub3c4\ud55c \uc0dd\uac01\uc744 \ud558\uac70\ub098 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc911 \ud0c8\uc120\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc218\uc9d1\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc911\ub2e8\ud558\uace0 \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ub0b4\ub824\uc57c \ud560 \uc2dc\uc810\uc744 \uc544\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uace0 LLM\uc5d0\uac8c \uc815\ubcf4 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \uc911\ub2e8\ud574\uc57c \ud560 \uc2dc\uc810\uc744 \uac00\ub974\uce58\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 \ubc18\uc0ac\uc2e4\uc801 \uc885\ub8cc \ubc0f \ucd94\ub860(CaRT)\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc885\ub8cc \uc2dc\uc810\uc744 \uc801\uc808\ud788 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 CaRT\ub294 \uc885\ub8cc\uac00 \uc801\uc808\ud55c \ubc18\uc0ac\uc2e4\uc801 \uacbd\ub85c\uc640 \uadf8\ub807\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ub3d9\uc77c \uacbd\ub85c\uc758 \ucd5c\uc18c \uc218\uc815 \ubc84\uc804\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec LLM\uc744 \uc138\ubd80 \uc870\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacbd\uc6b0 \ubaa8\ub450 \uc885\ub8cc \uacb0\uc815\uc758 \ud310\ub2e8 \uc774\uc720\ub97c \uc5b8\uc5b4\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc124\uba85\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d LLM\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba70, \uc774 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc138\ubd80 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uae30\ubcf8 LLM\uc5d0 \uc8fc\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 CaRT\ub97c \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778, \uc989 \ub300\ud654\ud615 \uc758\ub8cc \uc9c4\ub2e8 \ubc0f \uc218\ud559 \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0\uc5d0 \uad6c\ud604\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub450 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c CaRT\ub294 \ub2e4\ub978 \uc138\ubd80 \uc870\uc815 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc218\uc9d1\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc791\uc5c5 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b4\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Statutory and policy clauses are retrieved from\nlegal and underwriting corpora, embedded into the agent's observations, and\nused both to constrain feasible actions and to generate clause-grounded natural\nlanguage justifications.\n  Evaluated in a multi-agent treaty simulator calibrated to industry data,\nClauseLens reduces solvency violations by 51%, improves tail-risk performance\nby 27.9% (CVaR_0.10), and achieves 88.2% accuracy in clause-grounded\nexplanations with retrieval precision of 87.4% and recall of 91.1%.\n  These findings demonstrate that embedding legal context into both decision\nand explanation pathways yields interpretable, auditable, and\nregulation-aligned quoting behavior consistent with Solvency II, NAIC RBC, and\nthe EU AI Act.", "AI": {"tldr": "ClauseLens\ub294 \uc7ac\ubcf4\ud5d8 \uc870\uc57d \uac00\uaca9 \ucc45\uc815\uc744 \ud22c\uba85\ud558\uace0 \uaddc\uc81c \uc900\uc218 \ubc0f \uc704\ud5d8 \uc778\uc2dd\uc744 \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \ub3c4\uc640\uc8fc\ub294 \uac15\uc778\ud55c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc7ac\ubcf4\ud5d8 \uc870\uc57d \uac00\uaca9 \ucc45\uc815\uc740 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \uaddc\uc81c \uae30\uc900\uc744 \ucda9\uc871\ud574\uc57c \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uacac\uc801 \uad00\ud589\uc740 \ubd88\ud22c\uba85\ud558\uace0 \uac10\uc0ac\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub835\ub2e4.", "method": "ClauseLens\ub294 \uac00\uaca9 \ucc45\uc815 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc704\ud5d8 \uc778\uc2dd \uc81c\uc57d \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uacb0\uc815 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4(RA-CMDP)\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uba70, \ubc95\uc801 \ubc0f \uc778\uc218 \uc2ec\uc0ac \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uc870\ud56d\uc744 \uac80\uc0c9\ud558\uc5ec \ud589\uc704\ub97c \uc81c\uc57d\ud558\uace0 \uc790\uc5f0 \uc5b8\uc5b4\ub85c \ub41c \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc870\uc57d \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00\ub41c \uacb0\uacfc, ClauseLens\ub294 \uc9c0\uae09 \ub2a5\ub825 \uc704\ubc18\uc744 51% \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0, tail-risk \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 27.9% \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uba70, \uc870\ud56d \uae30\ubc18 \uc124\uba85\uc5d0\uc11c 88.2%\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc640 87.4%\uc758 \uac80\uc0c9 \uc815\ubc00\ub3c4, 91.1%\uc758 \uac80\uc0c9 \uc7ac\ud604\uc728\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubc95\uc801 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc744 \uacb0\uc815 \ubc0f \uc124\uba85 \uacbd\ub85c\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 Solvency II, NAIC RBC \ubc0f EU AI \ubc95\uacfc \uc77c\uce58\ud558\ub294 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uac10\uc0ac \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uaddc\uc81c \uc900\uc218 \uac00\uaca9 \ucc45\uc815 \ud589\uc704\ub97c \uc77c\uc73c\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc7ac\ubcf4\ud5d8 \uc870\uc57d \uac00\uaca9 \ucc45\uc815\uc740 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \uaddc\uc81c \uae30\uc900\uc744 \ucda9\uc871\ud574\uc57c \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uacac\uc801 \uad00\ud589\uc740 \ubd88\ud22c\uba85\ud558\uace0 \uac10\uc0ac\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub835\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc870\uc57d \uacac\uc801\uc744 \ud22c\uba85\ud558\uace0, \uaddc\uc81c \uc900\uc218 \ubc0f \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc778\uc2dd\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc870\ud56d \uae30\ubc18 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 ClauseLens\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.

However, an\noverlooked yet potentially powerful question is: can one leverage auxiliary\nunpaired multimodal data to directly enhance representation learning in a\ntarget modality? We introduce UML: Unpaired Multimodal Learner, a\nmodality-agnostic training paradigm in which a single model alternately\nprocesses inputs from different modalities while sharing parameters across\nthem. This design exploits the assumption that different modalities are\nprojections of a shared underlying reality, allowing the model to benefit from\ncross-modal structure without requiring explicit pairs. Theoretically, under\nlinear data-generating assumptions, we show that unpaired auxiliary data can\nyield representations strictly more informative about the data-generating\nprocess than unimodal training. Empirically, we show that using unpaired data\nfrom auxiliary modalities -- such as text, audio, or images -- consistently\nimproves downstream performance across diverse unimodal targets such as image\nand audio.

As a result, most current agents rely on supervised fine-tuning on\nexpert data, which is challenging to scale and generalizes poorly. This\nlimitation stems from the nature of expert demonstrations: they capture only a\nnarrow range of scenarios and expose the agent to limited environment\ndiversity. We address this limitation with a middle-ground paradigm we call\nearly experience: interaction data generated by the agent's own actions, where\nthe resulting future states serve as supervision without reward signals. Within\nthis paradigm we study two strategies of using such data: (1) Implicit world\nmodeling, which uses collected states to ground the policy in environment\ndynamics; and (2) Self-reflection, where the agent learns from its suboptimal\nactions to improve reasoning and decision-making. We evaluate across eight\ndiverse environments and multiple model families. Our approaches consistently\nimprove effectiveness and out-of-domain generalization, highlighting the value\nof early experience.

Thus, even when successful, it is difficult to characterize\nwhich policies will be learned and what they will do. In this work, we present\na theoretical framework for policy optimization that guarantees convergence to\na particular optimal policy, via vanishing entropy regularization and a\ntemperature decoupling gambit. Our approach realizes an interpretable,\ndiversity-preserving optimal policy as the regularization temperature vanishes\nand ensures the convergence of policy derived objects--value functions and\nreturn distributions.
