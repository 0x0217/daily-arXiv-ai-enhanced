In typical\nwarehouse environments, agents are often sparsely distributed along aisles.\nHowever, increasing the agent density can improve space efficiency. When the\nagent density is high, we must optimize the paths not only for goal-assigned\nagents but also for those obstructing them. This study proposes a novel MAPF\nframework for high-density environments (MAPF-HD). Several studies have\nexplored MAPF in similar settings using integer linear programming (ILP).\nHowever, ILP-based methods require substantial computation time to optimize all\nagent paths simultaneously. Even in small grid-based environments with fewer\nthan $100$ cells, these computations can incur tens to hundreds of seconds.\nThese high computational costs render these methods impractical for large-scale\napplications such as automated warehouses and valet parking. To address these\nlimitations, we introduce the phased null-agent swapping (PHANS) method. PHANS\nemploys a heuristic approach to incrementally swap positions between agents and\nempty vertices. This method solves the MAPF-HD problem within seconds to tens\nof seconds, even in large environments containing more than $700$ cells. The\nproposed method can potentially improve efficiency in various real-world\napplications such as warehouse logistics, traffic management, or crowd control.\nCode is available at https://github.com/ToyotaCRDL/MAPF-in-High-Density-Envs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uace0\ubc00\ub3c4 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uacbd\ub85c \ucc3e\uae30(MAPF-HD)\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04 \uc704\uce58 \uc2a4\uc640\ud551\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \ube60\ub974\uac8c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ucc3d\uace0 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubc00\ub3c4\ub97c \ub192\uc784\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uacf5\uac04 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uacbd\ub85c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud568\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "PHANS \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \ube48 \uc815\uc810 \uac04\uc758 \uc704\uce58 \uc2a4\uc640\ud551\uc744 \uc810\uc9c4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ud589\ud558\uba70, \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uacbd\ub85c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "PHANS \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 $700$\uac1c \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uc140\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uba87 \ucd08 \ub0b4\uc5d0 \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ucc3d\uace0 \ubc0f \ubc1c\ub81b \uc8fc\ucc28\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uacbd\ub85c \ucc3e\uae30(MAPF)\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uc774\ub3d9\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ucda9\ub3cc\uc744 \ud53c\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uacc4\ud68d\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ucc3d\uace0 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ubcf4\ud1b5 \ud1b5\ub85c\ub97c \ub530\ub77c \ub4dc\ubb38\ub4dc\ubb38 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubc00\ub3c4\ub97c \ub192\uc774\uba74 \uacf5\uac04 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc774 \uac1c\uc120\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubc00\ub3c4\uac00 \ub192\uc744 \ub54c\ub294 \ubaa9\ud45c\uac00 \uc9c0\uc815\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uadf8\ub4e4\uc744 \ubc29\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574\uc11c\ub3c4 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud574\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uace0\ubc00\ub3c4 \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 MAPF \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c(MAPF-HD)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\uc218 \uc120\ud615 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d(ILP)\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud574 \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c MAPF\ub97c \ud0d0\uad6c\ud574\uc654\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc ILP \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc2dc\uac04\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. $100$\uac1c \ubbf8\ub9cc\uc758 \uc140\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \uc791\uc740 \uadf8\ub9ac\ub4dc \uae30\ubc18 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacc4\uc0b0\uc740 \uc218\uc2ed \ucd08\uc5d0\uc11c \uc218\ubc31 \ucd08\uac00 \uac78\ub9b4 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub192\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ucc3d\uace0 \ubc0f \ubc1c\ub81b \uc8fc\ucc28\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc801 \ub110 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2a4\uc640\ud551(PHANS) \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

We\nconsider the case in which the cancer is \"diffuse\", dispersed such that there\nare multiple distinct cancer sites. We investigate the problem of a swarm of\nnanobots locating these sites and treating them by dropping drug payloads at\nthe sites. To improve the success of the treatment, the drug payloads must be\nallocated between sites according to their \"demands\"; this requires extra\nnanobot coordination. We present a mathematical model of the behavior of the\nnanobot agents and of their colloidal environment. This includes a movement\nmodel for agents based upon experimental findings from actual nanoparticles in\nwhich bots noisily ascend and descend chemical gradients. We present three\nalgorithms: The first algorithm, called KM, is the most representative of\nreality, with agents simply following naturally existing chemical signals that\nsurround each cancer site. The second algorithm, KMA, includes an additional\nchemical payload which amplifies the existing natural signals. The third\nalgorithm, KMAR, includes another additional chemical payload which counteracts\nthe other signals, instead inducing negative chemotaxis in agents such that\nthey are repelled from sites that are already sufficiently treated. We present\nsimulation results for all algorithms across different types of cancer\narrangements. For KM, we show that the treatment is generally successful unless\nthe natural chemical signals are weak, in which case the treatment progresses\ntoo slowly.

However, training\nBNNs remains challenging due to the lack of target data. To address this, we\npropose leveraging Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications to define\ntraining objectives for BNNs. We build on the quantitative semantics of STL,\nenabling gradient-based optimization of the BNN weights, and introduce a\nlearning algorithm that enables BNNs to perform regression and control tasks in\nbiological systems. Specifically, we investigate two regression problems in\nwhich we train BNNs to act as reporters of dysregulated states, and a feedback\ncontrol problem in which we train the BNN in closed-loop with a chronic disease\nmodel, learning to reduce inflammation while avoiding adverse responses to\nexternal infections. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that STL-based\nlearning can solve the investigated regression and control tasks efficiently.", "AI": {"tldr": "BNNs\uc740 \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud569\uc131 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \uc778\uacf5\uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc73c\ub85c, \ud6c8\ub828\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4\uc11c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd80\uc871 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc2e0\ud638 \uc2dc\uac04 \ub17c\ub9ac(STL)\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uc815\uc758\ud558\uace0, \ud68c\uadc0 \ubc0f \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "BNNs\uc758 \ud6c8\ub828\uc740 \ubaa9\ud45c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ubd80\uc871\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc2e0\ud638 \uc2dc\uac04 \ub17c\ub9ac(STL)\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec BNNs\uc758 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uc815\uc758\ud558\uace0, BNN \uac00\uc911\uce58\uc758 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \uae30\ubc18 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "STL \uae30\ubc18 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 BNNs\uac00 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \ubcf4\ub3c4\ud558\ub294 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uace0, \ub9cc\uc131 \uc9c8\ud658 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc\uc758 \ud3d0\uc1c4 \ub8e8\ud504\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\uc5ec \uc5fc\uc99d\uc744 \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uc678\ubd80 \uac10\uc5fc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubd80\uc815\uc801\uc778 \ubc18\uc751\uc744 \ud53c\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "STL \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5\uc774 \uc870\uc0ac\ub41c \ud68c\uadc0 \ubc0f \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc0dd\uccb4 \ubd84\uc790 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(BNN)\uc740 \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud569\uc131 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \uc778\uacf5 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc73c\ub85c, \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801 \ud68c\ub85c\ub97c \ub118\uc5b4\uc11c\ub294 \ubcf4\ud3b8\uc801\uc778 \ud568\uc218 \uadfc\uc0ac\ud654 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 BNN\uc758 \ud6c8\ub828\uc740 \ubaa9\ud45c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd80\uc871\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc2e0\ud638 \uc2dc\uac04 \ub17c\ub9ac(STL) \uc0ac\uc591\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec BNN\uc758 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uc815\uc758\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 STL\uc758 \uc815\ub7c9\uc801 \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uc5ec BNN \uac00\uc911\uce58\uc758 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \uae30\ubc18 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uace0, BNN\uc774 \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud68c\uadc0 \ubc0f \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 BNN\uc774 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc758 \ubcf4\uace0\uc790 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud68c\uadc0 \ubb38\uc81c\uc640 \ub9cc\uc131 \uc9c8\ud658 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ud3d0\uc1c4 \ub8e8\ud504\uc5d0\uc11c BNN\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\uc5ec \uc5fc\uc99d\uc744 \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uc678\ubd80 \uac10\uc5fc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubd80\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud53c\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc218\uce58 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc740 STL \uae30\ubc18 \ud559\uc2b5\uc774 \uc870\uc0ac\ub41c \ud68c\uadc0 \ubc0f \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL)\naddresses this by decomposing tasks into more manageable sub-tasks, but the\nautomatic discovery of the hierarchy and the joint training of multi-level\npolicies often suffer from instability and can lack theoretical guarantees. In\nthis paper, we introduce Reinforcement Learning with Anticipation (RLA), a\nprincipled and potentially scalable framework designed to address these\nlimitations. The RLA agent learns two synergistic models: a low-level,\ngoal-conditioned policy that learns to reach specified subgoals, and a\nhigh-level anticipation model that functions as a planner, proposing\nintermediate subgoals on the optimal path to a final goal. The key feature of\nRLA is the training of the anticipation model, which is guided by a principle\nof value geometric consistency, regularized to prevent degenerate solutions. We\npresent proofs that RLA approaches the globally optimal policy under various\nconditions, establishing a principled and convergent method for hierarchical\nplanning and execution in long-horizon goal-conditioned tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc7a5\uae30 \ubaa9\ud45c \uae30\ubc18 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c RLA(\uc608\uc0c1 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc7a5\uae30 \ubaa9\ud45c \uae30\ubc18 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud574\uacb0\uc758 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uacfc HRL\uc758 \ubd88\uc548\uc815\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud568.", "method": "RLA \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc800\uc218\uc900 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc870\uac74 \uc815\ucc45\uacfc \uace0\uc218\uc900 \uc608\uc0c1 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uc5ec \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "RLA\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc870\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c \uc804\uc5ed \ucd5c\uc801 \uc815\ucc45\uc5d0 \uc811\uadfc\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "RLA\ub294 \uc7a5\uae30 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc870\uac74 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uacc4\ud68d \ubc0f \uc2e4\ud589\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc6d0\ub9ac\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc218\ub834\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud655\ub9bd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc7a5\uae30 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc870\uac74 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(HRL)\uc740 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ub354 \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\uae30 \uc26c\uc6b4 \ud558\uc704 \uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uacc4\uce35\uc758 \uc790\ub3d9 \ubc1c\uacac\uacfc \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc815\ucc45\uc758 \uacf5\ub3d9 \ud6c8\ub828\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \ubd88\uc548\uc815\uc131\uc5d0 \uc2dc\ub2ec\ub9ac\uba70 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc6d0\uce59\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 \uc608\uc0c1 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RLA)\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

This paper overcomes this barrier by\nconstructing, to our knowledge, the first sublinear-space ZKP prover. Our core\ncontribution is an equivalence that reframes proof generation as an instance of\nthe classic Tree Evaluation problem. Leveraging a recent space-efficient\ntree-evaluation algorithm, we design a streaming prover that assembles the\nproof without ever materializing the full execution trace. The approach reduces\nprover memory from linear in T to O(sqrt(T)) (up to O(log T) lower-order terms)\nwhile preserving proof size, verifier time, and the transcript/security\nguarantees of the underlying system.

While compression techniques such as\npruning and quantization are widely used, most rely on uniform heuristics that\nignore architectural and runtime heterogeneity. Profiling tools expose\nper-layer latency, memory, and compute cost, yet are rarely integrated into\nautomated pipelines. We propose ProfilingAgent, a profiling-guided, agentic\napproach that uses large language models (LLMs) to automate compression via\nstructured pruning and post-training dynamic quantization. Our modular\nmulti-agent system reasons over static metrics (MACs, parameter counts) and\ndynamic signals (latency, memory) to design architecture-specific strategies.\nUnlike heuristic baselines, ProfilingAgent tailors layer-wise decisions to\nbottlenecks. Experiments on ImageNet-1K, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 with\nResNet-101, ViT-B/16, Swin-B, and DeiT-B/16 show pruning maintains competitive\nor improved accuracy (about 1% drop on ImageNet-1K, +2% gains for ViT-B/16 on\nsmaller datasets), while quantization achieves up to 74% memory savings with\n<0.5% accuracy loss.

We uploaded it into ArXiv as pre-print", "summary": "Scams exploiting real-time social engineering -- such as phishing,\nimpersonation, and phone fraud -- remain a persistent and evolving threat\nacross digital platforms. Existing defenses are largely reactive, offering\nlimited protection during active interactions. We propose a privacy-preserving,\nAI-in-the-loop framework that proactively detects and disrupts scam\nconversations in real time. The system combines instruction-tuned artificial\nintelligence with a safety-aware utility function that balances engagement with\nharm minimization, and employs federated learning to enable continual model\nupdates without raw data sharing. Experimental evaluations show that the system\nproduces fluent and engaging responses (perplexity as low as 22.3, engagement\n$\\approx$0.80), while human studies confirm significant gains in realism,\nsafety, and effectiveness over strong baselines. In federated settings, models\ntrained with FedAvg sustain up to 30 rounds while preserving high engagement\n($\\approx$0.80), strong relevance ($\\approx$0.74), and low PII leakage\n($\\leq$0.0085). Even with differential privacy, novelty and safety remain\nstable, indicating that robust privacy can be achieved without sacrificing\nperformance. The evaluation of guard models (LlamaGuard, LlamaGuard2/3,\nMD-Judge) shows a straightforward pattern: stricter moderation settings reduce\nthe chance of exposing personal information, but they also limit how much the\nmodel engages in conversation. In contrast, more relaxed settings allow longer\nand richer interactions, which improve scam detection, but at the cost of\nhigher privacy risk. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to unify\nreal-time scam-baiting, federated privacy preservation, and calibrated safety\nmoderation into a proactive defense paradigm.", "AI": {"tldr":

The most prevalent strategies are to actively collect\ntrajectories by interacting with the environment during online training or\ntraining on offline datasets. At first glance, the nature of learning\ntask-agnostic environment dynamics makes world models a good candidate for\neffective offline training. However, the effects of online vs. offline data on\nworld models and thus on the resulting task performance have not been\nthoroughly studied in the literature. In this work, we investigate both\nparadigms in model-based settings, conducting experiments on 31 different\nenvironments. First, we showcase that online agents outperform their offline\ncounterparts. We identify a key challenge behind performance degradation of\noffline agents: encountering Out-Of-Distribution states at test time. This\nissue arises because, without the self-correction mechanism in online agents,\noffline datasets with limited state space coverage induce a mismatch between\nthe agent's imagination and real rollouts, compromising policy training. We\ndemonstrate that this issue can be mitigated by allowing for additional online\ninteractions in a fixed or adaptive schedule, restoring the performance of\nonline training with limited interaction data. We also showcase that\nincorporating exploration data helps mitigate the performance degradation of\noffline agents. Based on our insights, we recommend adding exploration data\nwhen collecting large datasets, as current efforts predominantly focus on\nexpert data alone.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294

With this complexity comes a greater\nrisk of security threats that can affect not just machines but real people's\nlives. To address this challenge, we present ThreatGPT, an agentic Artificial\nIntelligence (AI) assistant built to help people whether they are engineers,\nsafety officers, or policy makers to understand and analyze threats in public\nsafety systems. Instead of requiring deep cybersecurity expertise, it allows\nusers to simply describe the components of a system they are concerned about,\nsuch as login systems, data storage, or communication networks. Then, with the\nclick of a button, users can choose how they want the system to be analyzed by\nusing popular frameworks such as STRIDE, MITRE ATT&CK, CVE reports, NIST, or\nCISA. ThreatGPT is unique because it does not just provide threat information,\nbut rather it acts like a knowledgeable partner. Using few-shot learning, the\nAI learns from examples and generates relevant smart threat models. It can\nhighlight what might go wrong, how attackers could take advantage, and what can\nbe done to prevent harm.

We present NoteAid-Chatbot, a conversational AI that promotes\npatient understanding via a novel 'learning as conversation' framework, built\non a multi-agent large language model (LLM) and reinforcement learning (RL)\nsetup without human-labeled data. NoteAid-Chatbot was built on a lightweight\nLLaMA 3.2 3B model trained in two stages: initial supervised fine-tuning on\nconversational data synthetically generated using medical conversation\nstrategies, followed by RL with rewards derived from patient understanding\nassessments in simulated hospital discharge scenarios. Our evaluation, which\nincludes comprehensive human-aligned assessments and case studies, demonstrates\nthat NoteAid-Chatbot exhibits key emergent behaviors critical for patient\neducation, such as clarity, relevance, and structured dialogue, even though it\nreceived no explicit supervision for these attributes. Our results show that\neven simple Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based reward modeling can\nsuccessfully train lightweight, domain-specific chatbots to handle multi-turn\ninteractions, incorporate diverse educational strategies, and meet nuanced\ncommunication objectives. Our Turing test demonstrates that NoteAid-Chatbot\nsurpasses non-expert human.

To make this modeling approach more scalable and\naccessible, we propose a data-driven framework for queueing network modeling\nand simulation based on autoregressive sequence models trained on event-stream\ndata. Instead of explicitly specifying arrival processes, service mechanisms,\nor routing logic, our approach learns the conditional distributions of event\ntypes and event times, recasting the modeling task as a problem of sequence\ndistribution learning. We show that Transformer-style architectures can\neffectively parameterize these distributions, enabling automated construction\nof high-fidelity simulators. As a proof of concept, we validate our framework\non event tables generated from diverse queueing networks, showcasing its\nutility in simulation, uncertainty quantification, and counterfactual\nevaluation. Leveraging advances in artificial intelligence and the growing\navailability of data, our framework takes a step toward more automated,\ndata-driven modeling pipelines to support broader adoption of queueing network\nmodels across service domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ud050\uc789 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0

However, most\nexisting frameworks are tailored to domains such as mathematics, coding, or web\nautomation, and fall short on geospatial tasks that require spatial reasoning,\nmulti-hop planning, and real-time map interaction. To address these challenges,\nwe introduce MapAgent, a hierarchical multi-agent plug-and-play framework with\ncustomized toolsets and agentic scaffolds for map-integrated geospatial\nreasoning. Unlike existing flat agent-based approaches that treat tools\nuniformly-often overwhelming the LLM when handling similar but subtly different\ngeospatial APIs-MapAgent decouples planning from execution. A high-level\nplanner decomposes complex queries into subgoals, which are routed to\nspecialized modules. For tool-heavy modules-such as map-based services-we then\ndesign a dedicated map-tool agent that efficiently orchestrates related APIs\nadaptively in parallel to effectively fetch geospatial data relevant for the\nquery, while simpler modules (e.g., solution generation or answer extraction)\noperate without additional agent overhead. This hierarchical design reduces\ncognitive load, improves tool selection accuracy, and enables precise\ncoordination across similar APIs. We evaluate MapAgent on four diverse\ngeospatial benchmarks-MapEval-Textual, MapEval-API, MapEval-Visual, and\nMapQA-and demonstrate substantial gains over state-of-the-art tool-augmented\nand agentic baselines.

Recently, researchers\nhave successfully leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate\nprogrammatic policies for single-agent tasks, transforming neural network-based\npolicies into interpretable rule-based code with high execution efficiency.\nInspired by this, we propose PolicyEvolve, a general framework for generating\nprogrammatic policies in multi-player games. PolicyEvolve significantly reduces\nreliance on manually crafted policy code, achieving high-performance policies\nwith minimal environmental interactions. The framework comprises four modules:\nGlobal Pool, Local Pool, Policy Planner, and Trajectory Critic. The Global Pool\npreserves elite policies accumulated during iterative training. The Local Pool\nstores temporary policies for the current iteration; only sufficiently\nhigh-performing policies from this pool are promoted to the Global Pool. The\nPolicy Planner serves as the core policy generation module. It samples the top\nthree policies from the Global Pool, generates an initial policy for the\ncurrent iteration based on environmental information, and refines this policy\nusing feedback from the Trajectory Critic. Refined policies are then deposited\ninto the Local Pool. This iterative process continues until the policy achieves\na sufficiently high average win rate against the Global Pool, at which point it\nis integrated into the Global Pool. The Trajectory Critic analyzes interaction\ndata from the current policy, identifies vulnerabilities, and proposes\ndirectional improvements to guide the Policy Planner", "AI": {"tldr": "PolicyEvolve\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\uc5b4 \uac8c\uc784\uc5d0\uc11c \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc801 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc218\uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\uc131\ub41c \uc815\ucc45 \ucf54\ub4dc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uc904\uc774\uace0 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud55c\uc758 \ud658\uacbd \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \ub192\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc758 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "MARL\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \ub9ce\uc740 \uacbd\ud5d8 \uc0d8\ud50c\uacfc \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc790\uc6d0\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\uac83\ub4e4\uc740 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\uc81c \ubc30\uce58\uc5d0 \uc7a5\uc560\uac00 \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "PolicyEvolve\ub294 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ud480, \ub85c\uceec \ud480, \uc815\ucc45 \uae30\ud68d\uc790 \ubc0f \uada4\uc801 \ube44\ud3c9\uac00\uc758 \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubaa8\ub4c8\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc815\ucc45\uc774 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ud480\uc5d0\uc11c \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \ub192\uc740 \ud3c9\uade0 \uc2b9\ub960\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud560 \ub54c\uae4c\uc9c0 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "PolicyEvolve\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uace0\uc131\ub2a5\uc758 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(MARL)\uc740 \uc790\uae30 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub2e4\uc778\uc6a9 \uac8c\uc784 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\ub294 \ub370\ub294 \uc218\ubc31\ub9cc \uac1c\uc758 \uacbd\ud5d8 \uc0d8\ud50c\uacfc \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc790\uc6d0\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc815\ucc45\uc740 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\uc81c \ubc30\uce58\uc5d0 \uc7a5\uc560\uac00 \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc \uc5f0\uad6c\uc790\ub4e4\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud574 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc131\uacf5\ud588\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uace0\ud6a8\uc728 \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uaddc\uce59 \uae30\ubc18 \ucf54\ub4dc\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uc5d0 \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc544, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\uc5b4 \uac8c\uc784\uc5d0\uc11c \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc801 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 PolicyEvolve\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

For digital imagery, a\nmultitude of editing applications further complicates the forensic analysis,\nincluding semantic edits that alter content, photometric adjustments that\nrecalibrate colour characteristics, and geometric projections that reshape\nviewpoints. Collectively, these transformations manipulate and control\nperceptual interpretation of digital imagery. This susceptibility calls for\nforensic enquiry into reconstructing the chain of events, thereby revealing\ndeeper evidential insight into the presence or absence of criminal intent. This\nstudy seeks to address an inverse problem of tracing the underlying generation\nchain that gives rise to the observed synthetic media. A tell-tale watermarking\nsystem is developed for explanatory reasoning over the nature and extent of\ntransformations across the lifecycle of synthetic media. Tell-tale watermarks\nare tailored to different classes of transformations, responding in a manner\nthat is neither strictly robust nor fragile but instead interpretable. These\nwatermarks function as reference clues that evolve under the same\ntransformation dynamics as the carrier media, leaving interpretable traces when\nsubjected to transformations. Explanatory reasoning is then performed to infer\nthe most plausible account across the combinatorial parameter space of\ncomposite transformations. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the validity of\ntell-tale watermarking with respect to fidelity, synchronicity and\ntraceability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ud569\uc131 \ubbf8\ub514\uc5b4\uc758

To overcome this fundamental limitation, we previously proposed\nPREFACE, a model-agnostic framework based on reinforcement learning (RL) that\niteratively repairs the prompts provided to frozen LLMs, systematically\nsteering them toward generating formally verifiable Dafny code without costly\nfine-tuning. This work presents Proof2Silicon, a novel end-to-end synthesis\nframework that embeds the previously proposed PREFACE flow to enable the\ngeneration of correctness-by-construction hardware directly from natural\nlanguage specifications. Proof2Silicon operates by: (1) leveraging PREFACE's\nverifier-driven RL agent to optimize prompt generation iteratively, ensuring\nDafny code correctness; (2) automatically translating verified Dafny programs\ninto synthesizable high-level C using Dafny's Python backend and PyLog; and (3)\nemploying Vivado HLS to produce RTL implementations. Evaluated rigorously on a\nchallenging 100-task benchmark, PREFACE's RL-guided prompt optimization\nconsistently improved Dafny verification success rates across diverse LLMs by\nup to 21%.

This\npaper proposes the application of W3C-endorsed Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)\nto establish secure and trustful communication channels among network functions\nin 5G and subsequent generations. A new communication agent is introduced that\nintegrates seamlessly with 5G-standardized network functions and utilizes a\nDID-based application layer transport protocol to ensure confidentiality,\nintegrity, and authenticity for cross-domain interactions. A comparative\nanalysis of the two different versions of the DID-based communication protocol\nfor inter network function communication reveals compatibility advantages of\nthe latest protocol iteration. Furthermore, a comprehensive evaluation of the\ncommunication overhead caused by both protocol iterations compared to\ntraditional TCP/TLS shows the benefits of using DIDs to improve communication\nsecurity, albeit with performance loses compared to TCP/TLS.

We propose REMI, a Causal Schema Memory architecture for a multimodal\nlifestyle agent that integrates a personal causal knowledge graph, a causal\nreasoning engine, and a schema based planning module. The idea is to deliver\nexplainable, personalized recommendations in domains like fashion, personal\nwellness, and lifestyle planning. Our architecture uses a personal causal graph\nof the user's life events and habits, performs goal directed causal traversals\nenriched with external knowledge and hypothetical reasoning, and retrieves\nadaptable plan schemas to generate tailored action plans. A Large Language\nModel orchestrates these components, producing answers with transparent causal\nexplanations. We outline the CSM system design and introduce new evaluation\nmetrics for personalization and explainability, including Personalization\nSalience Score and Causal Reasoning Accuracy, to rigorously assess its\nperformance. Results indicate that CSM based agents can provide more context\naware, user aligned recommendations compared to baseline LLM agents.

Due to the high cost of\nlabeling and maintenance, recent research has turned to online HD map\nconstruction using onboard sensor data, offering wider coverage and more timely\nupdates for autonomous vehicles. However, the robustness of online map\nconstruction under adversarial conditions remains underexplored. In this paper,\nwe present a systematic vulnerability analysis of online map construction\nmodels, which reveals that these models exhibit an inherent bias toward\npredicting symmetric road structures. In asymmetric scenes like forks or\nmerges, this bias often causes the model to mistakenly predict a straight\nboundary that mirrors the opposite side. We demonstrate that this vulnerability\npersists in the real-world and can be reliably triggered by obstruction or\ntargeted interference. Leveraging this vulnerability, we propose a novel\ntwo-stage attack framework capable of manipulating online constructed maps.\nFirst, our method identifies vulnerable asymmetric scenes along the victim AV's\npotential route. Then, we optimize the location and pattern of camera-blinding\nattacks and adversarial patch attacks. Evaluations on a public AD dataset\ndemonstrate that our attacks can degrade mapping accuracy by up to 9.9%, render\nup to 44% of targeted routes unreachable, and increase unsafe planned\ntrajectory rates, colliding with real-world road boundaries, by up to 27%.\nThese attacks are also validated on a real-world testbed vehicle. We further\nanalyze root causes of the symmetry bias, attributing them to training data\nimbalance, model architecture, and map element representation.

Submitted to WSDM 2026", "summary": "Table reasoning is crucial for leveraging structured data in domains such as\nfinance, healthcare, and scientific research. While large language models\n(LLMs) show promise in multi-step reasoning, purely text-based methods often\nstruggle with the complex numerical computations and fine-grained operations\ninherently required in this task. Tool-integrated reasoning improves\ncomputational accuracy via explicit code execution, yet existing systems\nfrequently rely on rigid patterns, supervised imitation, and lack true\nautonomous adaptability. In this paper, we present TableMind, an LLM-driven\ntable reasoning agent that (i) autonomously performs multi-turn tool\ninvocation, (ii) writes and executes data-analyzing code in a secure sandbox\nenvironment for data analysis and precise numerical reasoning, and (iii)\nexhibits high-level capabilities such as planning and self-reflection to adapt\nstrategies. To realize these capabilities, we adopt a two-stage fine-tuning\nparadigm built on top of a powerful pre-trained language model: supervised\nfine-tuning on high-quality reasoning trajectories to establish effective tool\nusage patterns, followed by reinforcement fine-tuning to optimize\nmulti-objective strategies. In particular, we propose Rank-Aware Policy\nOptimization (RAPO), which increases the update weight of high-quality\ntrajectories when their output probabilities are lower than those of\nlow-quality ones, thereby guiding the model more consistently toward better and\nmore accurate answers. Extensive experiments on several mainstream benchmarks\ndemonstrate that TableMind achieves superior performance compared to\ncompetitive baselines, yielding substantial gains in both reasoning

One\nsuch application is Deep Research (DR), which requires extensive search and\nreasoning over many sources. Our work in this paper focuses on the development\nof native Autonomous Single-Agent models for DR featuring minimal web crawling\nand Python tool integration. Unlike multi-agent systems, where agents take up\npre-defined roles and are told what to do at each step in a static workflow, an\nautonomous single-agent determines its next action dynamically based on\ncontext, without manual directive. While prior work has proposed training\nrecipes for base or instruction-tuned LLMs, we focus on continual reinforcement\nlearning (RL) of reasoning-optimized models to further enhance agentic skills\nwhile preserving reasoning ability. Towards this end, we propose a simple RL\nrecipe with entirely synthetic data, which we apply to various open-source\nLLMs. Our best variant SFR-DR-20B achieves up to 28.7% on Humanity's Last Exam\nbenchmark.

While standard benchmarks evaluate LLM reasoning on complex problem\nsets using aggregated metrics, they often obscure foundational weaknesses. In\nthis work, we probe LLM mathematical numeracy by evaluating performance on\nproblems of escalating complexity, from constituent operations to combinatorial\npuzzles. We test several state-of-the-art LLM-based agents on a 100-problem\nchallenge comprising four categories: (1) basic arithmetic, (2) advanced\noperations, (3) primality checking, and (4) the Game of 24 number puzzle. Our\nresults show that while the agents achieved high accuracy on the first three\ncategories, which require deterministic algorithmic execution, they\nconsistently failed at the number puzzle, underlining its demand for a\nheuristic search over a large combinatorial space to be a significant\nbottleneck. These findings reveal that the agents' proficiency is largely\nconfined to recalling and executing known algorithms, rather than performing\ngenerative problem-solving. This suggests their apparent numerical reasoning is\nmore akin to sophisticated pattern-matching than flexible, analytical thought,\nlimiting their potential for tasks that require novel or creative numerical\ninsights.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \ub180\ub77c\uc6b4 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc73c\ub098 \uc218\uce58 \ucd94\ub860\uc758 \uac15\uc778\uc131\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc758\ubb38\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc5ec LLM\uc758 \uc218\ud559\uc801 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uace0, \uace0\uae09 \uc218\ud559\uc801 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc6b0\uc218\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc9c0\ub9cc \ud2b9\uc815 \uc870\ud569 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc2e4\ud328\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc218\uce58 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc758 \uac15\uc778\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud558\uc5ec.", "method": "100\uac1c\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \ucc4c\ub9b0\uc9c0\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5ec\ub7ec LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \uae30\ubcf8 \uc0b0\uc220, \uace0\uae09 \uc791\uc5c5, \uc18c\uc218 \ud310\ubcc4, \uc22b\uc790 \ud37c\uc990 \ub4f1 \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \uce74\ud14c\uace0\ub9ac\ub85c \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc838 \uc788\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uae30\ubcf8 \uc0b0\uc220, \uace0\uae09 \uc791\uc5c5, \uc18c\uc218 \ud310\ubcc4\uc5d0\uc11c \ub192\uc740 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uae30\ub85d\ud588\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc22b\uc790 \ud37c\uc990\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uc2e4\ud328\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825\uc740 \uc8fc\ub85c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \uae30\uc5b5 \ubc0f \uc2e4\ud589\uc5d0 \uc81c\ud55c\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ucc3d\uc758\uc801\uc778 \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0\uc740 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \ub180\ub77c\uc6b4 \ucd9c\ud604 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub4e4\uc758 \uc218\uce58 \ucd94\ub860\uc758 \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ud574\uacb0\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc774\ub2e4. \ud45c\uc900 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub294 \uc9d1\uacc4\ub41c \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c \uc9d1\ud569\uc5d0\uc11c LLM\uc758 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub4e4\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uae30\ucd08\uc801\uc778 \uc57d\uc810\uc744 \uac00\ub9b0\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uad6c\uc131 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc870\ud569 \ud37c\uc990\uc5d0 \uc774\ub974\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc5ec LLM\uc758 \uc218\ud559\uc801 \uc218\uce58 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uae30\ubcf8 \uc0b0\uc220, \uace0\uae09 \uc791\uc5c5, \uc18c\uc218 \ud310\ubcc4, 24 \uc22b\uc790 \ud37c\uc990\uc758 \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \uce74\ud14c\uace0\ub9ac\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c 100\ubb38\uc81c \ucc4c\ub9b0\uc9c0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5ec\ub7ec \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uacb0\uc815\ub860\uc801 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \uc2e4\ud589\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \uccab \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uce74\ud14c\uace0\ub9ac\uc5d0\uc11c \ub192\uc740 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc73c\ub098, \uc22b\uc790 \ud37c\uc990\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uc2e4\ud328\ud588\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ud070 \uc870\ud569 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc8fc\uc694 \ubcd1\ubaa9\uc784\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc1c\uacac\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \uc8fc\ub85c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uae30\uc5b5\ud558\uace0 \uc2e4\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uad6d\ud55c\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc0dd\uc131\uc801 \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ub370\ub294 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uadf8\ub4e4\uc758 \uc218\uce58 \ucd94\ub860\uc774 \uc720\uc5f0\ud558\uace0 \ubd84\uc11d\uc801\uc778 \uc0ac\uace0\ubcf4\ub2e4\ub294 \uc815\uad50\ud55c \ud328\ud134 \ub9e4\uce6d\uc5d0 \ub354\uc6b1 \uac00\uae4c\uc6cc \ud601\uc2e0\uc801\uc774\uac70\ub098 \ucc3d\uc758\uc801\uc778 \uc218\uce58 \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

Consequently,\nensuring the security and resilience of IoT systems has become a critical\nrequirement. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and efficient intrusion\ndetection system (IDS) for IoT environments, leveraging a hybrid model of CNN\nand ConvNeXt-Tiny. The proposed method is designed to detect and classify\ndifferent types of network attacks, particularly botnet and malicious traffic,\nwhile the lightweight ConvNeXt-Tiny architecture enables effective deployment\nin resource-constrained devices and networks. A real-world dataset comprising\nboth benign and malicious network packets collected from practical IoT\nscenarios was employed in the experiments. The results demonstrate that the\nproposed method achieves high accuracy while significantly reducing training\nand inference time compared to more complex models. Specifically, the system\nattained 99.63% accuracy in the testing phase, 99.67% accuracy in the training\nphase, and an error rate of 0.0107 across eight classes, while maintaining\nshort response times and low resource consumption. These findings highlight the\neffectiveness of the proposed method in detecting and classifying attacks in\nreal-world IoT environments, indicating that the lightweight architecture can\nserve as a practical alternative to complex and resource-intensive approaches\nin IoT network security.", "AI": {"tldr": "IoT \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uacbd\ub7c9\ud654\ub41c

Existing sequence or structure\nmethods rely on single-view features and fail to identify antibody-specific\nbinding sites on the antigens. In this paper, we propose \\textbf{CAME-AB}, a\nnovel Cross-modality Attention framework with a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)\nbackbone for robust antibody binding site prediction. CAME-AB integrates five\nbiologically grounded modalities, including raw amino acid encodings, BLOSUM\nsubstitution profiles, pretrained language model embeddings, structure-aware\nfeatures, and GCN-refined biochemical graphs, into a unified multimodal\nrepresentation. To enhance adaptive cross-modal reasoning, we propose an\n\\emph{adaptive modality fusion} module that learns to dynamically weight each\nmodality based on its global relevance and input-specific contribution. A\nTransformer encoder combined with an MoE module further promotes feature\nspecialization and capacity expansion. We additionally incorporate a supervised\ncontrastive learning objective to explicitly shape the latent space geometry,\nencouraging intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. To improve\noptimization stability and generalization, we apply stochastic weight averaging\nduring training. Extensive experiments on benchmark antibody-antigen datasets\ndemonstrate that CAME-AB consistently outperforms strong baselines on multiple\nmetrics, including Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC, and MCC.

However, there is no systematic understanding of this\nemerging approach. These hybrid systems address critical cybersecurity\nchallenges by combining neural pattern recognition with symbolic reasoning,\nenabling enhanced threat understanding while introducing concerning autonomous\noffensive capabilities that reshape threat landscapes. In this survey, we\nsystematically characterize this field by analyzing 127 publications spanning\n2019-July 2025. We introduce a Grounding-Instructibility-Alignment (G-I-A)\nframework to evaluate these systems, focusing on both cyber defense and cyber\noffense across network security, malware analysis, and cyber operations. Our\nanalysis shows advantages of multi-agent NeSy architectures and identifies\ncritical implementation challenges including standardization gaps,\ncomputational complexity, and human-AI collaboration requirements that\nconstrain deployment. We show that causal reasoning integration is the most\ntransformative advancement, enabling proactive defense beyond correlation-based\napproaches. Our findings highlight dual-use implications where autonomous\nsystems demonstrate substantial capabilities in zero-day exploitation while\nachieving significant cost reductions, altering threat dynamics. We provide\ninsights and future research directions, emphasizing the urgent need for\ncommunity-driven standardization frameworks and responsible development\npractices that ensure advancement serves

Large Language Models (LLMs) can act as seller\nagents, negotiating with buyers on behalf of sellers under given business\nconstraints. A critical ability for such agents is to track and accurately\ninterpret cumulative buyer intents across long negotiations, which directly\nimpacts bargaining effectiveness. We introduce a multi-turn evaluation\nframework for measuring the bargaining ability of seller agents in e-commerce\ndialogues. The framework tests whether an agent can extract and track buyer\nintents. Our contributions are: (1) a large-scale e-commerce bargaining\nbenchmark spanning 622 categories, 9,892 products, and 3,014 tasks; (2) a\nturn-level evaluation framework grounded in Theory of Mind (ToM) with annotated\nbuyer intents, moving beyond outcome-only metrics; and (3) an automated\npipeline that extracts reliable intent from massive dialogue data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uc911\uace0 \uc2dc\uc7a5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc911 \ud134 \ud611\uc0c1\uc740 \ud310\ub9e4\uc790\uc640 \uad6c\ub9e4\uc790 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc758 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ubd80\ubd84\uc774\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud310\ub9e4 \ub300\ub9ac\uc778\uc774 \ud310\ub9e4\uc790\ub97c \ub300\uc2e0\ud574 \ud611\uc0c1\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ub300\ud654\uc5d0\uc11c \uad6c\ub9e4\uc790\uc758 \uc758\ub3c4\ub97c \ucd94\uc801\ud558\uace0 \ud574\uc11d\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uc911\uace0 \uc2dc\uc7a5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud310\ub9e4\uc790\uc640 \uad6c\ub9e4\uc790 \uac04\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud134 \ud611\uc0c1\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud310\ub9e4 \ub300\ub9ac\uc778\uc758 \ud611\uc0c1 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uce21\uc815\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \ud134 \ud3c9\uac00 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0, \uad6c\ub9e4\uc790\uc758 \uc758\ub3c4\ub97c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\uace0 \ucd94\uc801\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "622\uac1c \uce74\ud14c\uace0\ub9ac, 9,892\uac1c \uc81c\ud488, 3,014\uac1c \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc804\uc790\uc0c1\uac70\ub798 \ud611\uc0c1 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc640 \uc778\uc9c0 \uc774\ub860\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \ud134 \uc218\uc900 \ud3c9\uac00 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub300\ud654 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc758\ub3c4\ub97c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uc911\uace0 \uc2dc\uc7a5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc911 \ud134 \ud611\uc0c1\uc740 \ud310\ub9e4\uc790\uc640 \uad6c\ub9e4\uc790 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc758 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ubd80\ubd84\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \ud2b9\uc815 \ube44\uc988\ub2c8\uc2a4 \uc81c\uc57d \ud558\uc5d0 \ud310\ub9e4\uc790\ub97c \ub300\uc2e0\ud574 \uad6c\ub9e4\uc790\uc640 \ud611\uc0c1\ud558\ub294 \ud310\ub9e4 \ub300\ub9ac\uc778 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub300\ub9ac\uc778\uc5d0\uac8c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub2a5\ub825\uc740 \uae34 \ud611\uc0c1 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ub204\uc801\ub41c \uad6c\ub9e4\uc790\uc758 \uc758\ub3c4\ub97c \ucd94\uc801\ud558\uace0 \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \ud574\uc11d\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c, \uc774\ub294 \ud611\uc0c1 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc778 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce69\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc804\uc790\uc0c1\uac70\ub798 \ub300\ud654\uc5d0\uc11c \ud310\ub9e4 \ub300\ub9ac\uc778\uc758 \ud611\uc0c1 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uce21\uc815\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \ud134 \ud3c9\uac00 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ub300\ub9ac\uc778\uc774 \uad6c\ub9e4\uc790\uc758 \uc758\ub3c4\ub97c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\uace0 \ucd94\uc801\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uae30\uc5ec\ub294 \ub2e4\uc74c\uacfc \uac19\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4: (1) 622\uac1c \uce74\ud14c\uace0\ub9ac, 9,892\uac1c \uc81c\ud488, 3,014\uac1c \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc804\uc790\uc0c1\uac70\ub798 \ud611\uc0c1 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c; (2) \uacb0\uacfc \uae30\ubc18 \uce21\uc815\uc744 \ub118\uc5b4, \uc8fc\uc11d \ucc98\ub9ac\ub41c \uad6c\ub9e4\uc790 \uc758\ub3c4\ub97c \uac16\ucd98 \ub9c8\uc74c\uc758 \uc774\ub860(Theory of Mind) \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ud134 \uc218\uc900 \ud3c9\uac00 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c; (3) \ubc29\ub300\ud55c \ub300\ud654 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc758\ub3c4\ub97c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778."}}

However, the high incidence\nof poor, incomplete, and inconsistent signal quality, can lead to false alarms\nor diagnostic inaccuracies. The methods explored so far suffer from limited\ngeneralizability, reliance on extensive labeled data, and poor cross-task\ntransferability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce QualityFM, a novel\nmultimodal foundation model for these physiological signals, designed to\nacquire a general-purpose understanding of signal quality. Our model is\npre-trained on an large-scale dataset comprising over 21 million 30-second\nwaveforms and 179,757 hours of data. Our approach involves a dual-track\narchitecture that processes paired physiological signals of differing quality,\nleveraging a self-distillation strategy where an encoder for high-quality\nsignals is used to guide the training of an encoder for low-quality signals. To\nefficiently handle long sequential signals and capture essential local\nquasi-periodic patterns, we integrate a windowed sparse attention mechanism\nwithin our Transformer-based model. Furthermore, a composite loss function,\nwhich combines direct distillation loss on encoder outputs with indirect\nreconstruction loss based on power and phase spectra, ensures the preservation\nof frequency-domain characteristics of the signals. We pre-train three models\nwith varying parameter counts (9.6 M to 319 M) and demonstrate their efficacy\nand practical value through transfer learning on three distinct clinical tasks:\nfalse alarm of ventricular tachycardia detection, the identification of atrial\nfibrillation and the estimation of arterial blood pressure (ABP) from PPG and\nECG signals.", "AI": {"tldr":

To address these limitations, we propose Tree of Agents (TOA), a\nmulti-agent reasoning framework that segments the input into chunks processed\nby independent agents. Each agent generates its local cognition, then agents\ndynamically exchange information for collaborative reasoning along\ntree-structured paths. TOA enables agents to probe different reasoning orders\nfor multi-perspective understanding, effectively mitigating position bias and\nreducing hallucinations. To improve processing efficiency, we incorporate\nprefix-hash caching and adaptive pruning strategies, achieving significant\nperformance improvements with comparable API overhead. Experiments show that\nTOA, powered by compact LLaMA3.1-8B, significantly outperforms multiple\nbaselines and demonstrates comparable performance to the latest and much larger\ncommercial models, such as Gemini1.5-pro, on various long-context tasks.

A central element of this process is the patient summary,\ntypically compiled by a medical oncologist, radiation oncologist, or surgeon,\nor their trained medical assistant, who distills heterogeneous medical records\ninto a concise narrative to facilitate discussion. This manual approach is\noften labor-intensive, subjective, and prone to omissions of critical\ninformation. To address these limitations, we introduce the Healthcare Agent\nOrchestrator (HAO), a Large Language Model (LLM)-driven AI agent that\ncoordinates a multi-agent clinical workflow to generate accurate and\ncomprehensive patient summaries for MTBs. Evaluating predicted patient\nsummaries against ground truth presents additional challenges due to stylistic\nvariation, ordering, synonym usage, and phrasing differences, which complicate\nthe measurement of both succinctness and completeness. To overcome these\nevaluation hurdles, we propose TBFact, a ``model-as-a-judge'' framework\ndesigned to assess the comprehensiveness and succinctness of generated\nsummaries. Using a benchmark dataset derived from de-identified tumor board\ndiscussions, we applied TBFact to evaluate our Patient History agent. Results\nshow that the agent captured 94% of high-importance information (including\npartial entailments) and achieved a TBFact recall of 0.84 under strict\nentailment criteria. We further demonstrate that TBFact enables a data-free\nevaluation framework that institutions can deploy locally without sharing\nsensitive clinical data.

Clinicians face difficulties\nretrieving rare disease cases due to privacy constraints and the limitations of\ntraditional cloud-based RAG systems in handling diverse formats and edge\ndevices. To address this, we introduce HyFedRAG, a unified and efficient\nFederated RAG framework tailored for Hybrid data modalities. By leveraging an\nedge-cloud collaborative mechanism, HyFedRAG enables RAG to operate across\ndiverse data sources while preserving data privacy. Our key contributions are:\n(1) We design an edge-cloud collaborative RAG framework built on Flower, which\nsupports querying structured SQL data, semi-structured knowledge graphs, and\nunstructured documents. The edge-side LLMs convert diverse data into\nstandardized privacy-preserving representations, and the server-side LLMs\nintegrates them for global reasoning and generation. (2) We integrate\nlightweight local retrievers with privacy-aware LLMs and provide three\nanonymization tools that enable each client to produce semantically rich,\nde-identified summaries for global inference across devices.

The Markov decision\nprocess (MDP) provides a structured framework for dynamic travel behavior\nmodeling at the individual level. However, solving an MDP in this context is\nhighly data-intensive and faces challenges of data quantity, spatial-temporal\ncoverage, and situational diversity. To address these, we propose a\ngroup-effect-enhanced generative adversarial imitation learning (gcGAIL) model\nthat improves the individual behavior modeling efficiency by leveraging shared\nbehavioral patterns among passenger groups. We validate the gcGAIL model using\na public transport fare-discount case study and compare against\nstate-of-the-art benchmarks, including adversarial inverse reinforcement\nlearning (AIRL), baseline GAIL, and conditional GAIL. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that gcGAIL outperforms these methods in learning individual travel\nbehavior responses to incentives over time in terms of accuracy,\ngeneralization, and pattern demonstration efficiency. Notably, gcGAIL is robust\nto spatial variation, data sparsity, and behavioral diversity, maintaining\nstrong performance even with partial expert demonstrations and underrepresented\npassenger groups. The gcGAIL model predicts the individual behavior response at\nany time, providing the basis for personalized incentives to induce sustainable\nbehavior changes (better timing of incentive injections).", "AI": {"tldr": "gcGAIL \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uadf8\ub8f9 \uac04 \uacf5\uc720 \ud589\ub3d9 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac1c\uc778 \uc5ec\ud589 \ud589\ub3d9 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uac1c\ubcc4 \uc5ec\ud589 \ud589\ub3d9 \ubc18\uc751\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ub3c4\uc2dc \uc774\ub3d9\uc131 \uaddc\uc81c \ubc0f \uc815\ucc45 \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uadf8\ub8f9 \ud6a8\uacfc \ud5a5\uc0c1 \uc0dd\uc131\uc801 \uc801\ub300 \ubaa8\ubc29 \ud559\uc2b5(gcGAIL) \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "gcGAIL \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uae30\ubc95\ub4e4\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec \uac1c\uc778 \uc5ec\ud589 \ud589\ub3d9 \ubc18\uc751\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "gcGAIL \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c \uc778\uc13c\ud2f0\ube0c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc5ec \uc9c0\uc18d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9 \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \uc720\ub3c4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac1c\ubcc4 \uc5ec\ud589 \ud589\ub3d9 \ubc18\uc751\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ub3c4\uc2dc \uc774\ub3d9\uc131 \uaddc\uc81c \ubc0f \uc815\ucc45 \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815(MDP)\uc740 \uac1c\ubcc4 \uc218\uc900\uc5d0\uc11c \ub3d9\uc801 \uc5ec\ud589 \ud589\ub3d9 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0\uc11c MDP\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc18c\ubaa8\uac00 \ud06c\uace0 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc591, \uc2dc\uacf5\uac04 \ubc94\uc704 \ubc0f \uc0c1\ud669\uc801 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uc758 \ub3c4\uc804\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc2b9\uac1d \uadf8\ub8f9 \uac04\uc758 \uacf5\uc720 \ud589\ub3d9 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac1c\uc778 \ud589\ub3d9 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \uadf8\ub8f9 \ud6a8\uacfc \ud5a5\uc0c1 \uc0dd\uc131\uc801 \uc801\ub300 \ubaa8\ubc29 \ud559\uc2b5(gcGAIL) \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 public transport fare-discount \uc0ac\ub840 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec gcGAIL \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uace0 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc5ed\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(AIRL), \uae30\uc900 GAIL \ubc0f \uc870\uac74\ubd80 GAIL\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uae30\uc900\ub4e4\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 gcGAIL\uc774 \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \uc778\uc13c\ud2f0\ube0c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac1c\uc778 \uc5ec\ud589 \ud589\ub3d9 \ubc18\uc751\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc815\ud655\uc131, \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ubc0f \ud328\ud134 \uc2dc\uc5f0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788, gcGAIL\uc740 \uacf5\uac04\uc801 \ubcc0\ud615, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud76c\uc18c\uc131 \ubc0f \ud589\ub3d9 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba70, \ubd80\ubd84 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc2dc\uc5f0 \ubc0f \uacfc\uc18c\ud45c\ud604\ub41c \uc2b9\uac1d \uadf8\ub8f9\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc88b\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. gcGAIL \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc5b8\uc81c\ub4e0\uc9c0 \uac1c\uc778 \ud589\ub3d9 \ubc18\uc751\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\uc5ec \uc9c0\uc18d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9 \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c \uc778\uc13c\ud2f0\ube0c(\uc778\uc13c\ud2f0\ube0c \uc8fc\uc785\uc758 \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc2dc\uae30)\uc758 \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Beyond merely using\npredefined shortcuts, MAS-Bench assesses an agent's capability to autonomously\ngenerate shortcuts by discovering and creating reusable, low-cost workflows. It\nfeatures 139 complex tasks across 11 real-world applications, a knowledge base\nof 88 predefined shortcuts (APIs, deep-links, RPA scripts), and 7 evaluation\nmetrics. The tasks are designed to be solvable via GUI-only operations, but can\nbe significantly accelerated by intelligently embedding shortcuts. Experiments\nshow that hybrid agents achieve significantly higher success rates and\nefficiency than their GUI-only counterparts. This result also demonstrates the\neffectiveness of our method for evaluating an agent's shortcut generation\ncapabilities. MAS-Bench fills a critical evaluation gap, providing a\nfoundational platform for future advancements in creating more efficient and\nrobust intelligent agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd98 GUI-\ub2e8\ucd95\ud0a4 \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc778 MAS-Bench\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8\ud3f0\uacfc \ucef4\ud4e8\ud130\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc5d0\uc11c GUI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "MAS-Bench\ub294 11\uac1c\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 139\uac1c\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e8\ucd95\ud0a4\ub97c \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 GUI \uc804\uc6a9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud6e8\uc52c \ub192\uc740 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uacfc \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "MAS-Bench\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ub2e8\ucd95\ud0a4 \uc0dd\uc131 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \ub354 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc9c0\ub2a5\ud615 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ub9cc\ub4dc\ub294 \ubbf8\ub798 \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uae30\ucd08 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "GUI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8\ud3f0 \ubc0f \ucef4\ud4e8\ud130\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc5d0\uc11c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc720\uc5f0\ud55c GUI \uc6b4\uc601\uacfc \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ub2e8\ucd95\ud0a4(API, \ub525 \ub9c1\ud06c \ub4f1)\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc774 \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \ubc29\ud5a5\uc73c\ub85c \ub5a0\uc624\ub974\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud0b9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc544\uc9c1 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \ud0d0\uc0c9\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uac04\uaca9\uc744 \ud574\uc18c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd98 GUI-\ub2e8\ucd95\ud0a4 \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc778 MAS-Bench\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Agents are represented as outcome distributions with\nepistemic utility given by log score, and compositions are defined through\nweighted logarithmic pooling that strictly improves every member's welfare. We\nprove that strict unanimity is impossible under linear pooling or in binary\noutcome spaces, but possible with three or more outcomes. Our framework admits\nrecursive structure via cloning invariance, continuity, and openness, while\ntilt-based analysis rules out trivial duplication. Finally, we formalize an\nagentic alignment phenomenon in LLMs using our theory: eliciting a benevolent\npersona (\"Luigi'\") induces an antagonistic counterpart (\"Waluigi\"), while a\nmanifest-then-suppress Waluigi strategy yields strictly larger first-order\nmisalignment reduction than pure Luigi reinforcement alone.

Traditional multi-objective optimization methods,\nsuch as linear programming and evolutionary algorithms, struggle to adapt in\nreal-time to the dynamic nature of supply chains. In this paper, we propose an\napproach that combines Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Multi-Objective\nEvolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) to address these challenges for dynamic\nmulti-objective optimization under uncertainty. Our method leverages MOEAs to\nsearch the parameter space of policy neural networks, generating a Pareto front\nof policies. This provides decision-makers with a diverse population of\npolicies that can be dynamically switched based on the current system\nobjectives, ensuring flexibility and adaptability in real-time decision-making.\nWe also introduce Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) to incorporate\nrisk-sensitive decision-making, enhancing resilience in uncertain environments.\nWe demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through case studies,\nshowcasing its ability to respond to supply chain dynamics and outperforming\nstate-of-the-art methods in an inventory management case study.

While large-scale pretraining has driven substantial progress,\nfine-tuning these models for aligning with human values or engaging in specific\ntasks or behaviors remains a critical challenge. Deep Reinforcement Learning\n(DRL) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) offer promising frameworks for\nthis aligning process. While DRL enables models to optimize actions using\nreward signals instead of relying solely on supervised preference data, DPO\ndirectly aligns the policy with preferences, eliminating the need for an\nexplicit reward model. This overview explores paradigms for fine-tuning LVLMs,\nhighlighting how DRL and DPO techniques can be used to align models with human\npreferences and values, improve task performance, and enable adaptive\nmultimodal interaction. We categorize key approaches, examine sources of\npreference data, reward signals, and discuss open challenges such as\nscalability, sample efficiency, continual learning, generalization, and safety.\nThe goal is to provide a clear understanding of how DRL and DPO contribute to\nthe evolution of robust and human-aligned LVLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "LVLM\uc758 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uc704\ud55c DRL \ubc0f DPO \uae30\ubc95\uc758 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uac00\uce58 \ubc0f \uc120\ud638\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucdb0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LVLM\uc774 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uac00\uce58 \ubc0f \ud2b9\uc815 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucdb0 \uc870\uc815\ub418\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "DRL\uacfc DPO \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec LVLM\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\uba70, \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc2e0\ud638\uc640 \uc120\ud638 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc120\ud638 \ubc0f \uac00\uce58\uc640 \uc77c\uce58\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc870\uc815\ud558\uace0 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uba70 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud568.", "conclusion": "DRL\uacfc DPO\uac00 \uac15\ub825\ud558\uace0 \uc778\uac04 \uce5c\ud654\uc801\uc778 LVLM\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uae30\uc5ec\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uba85\ud655\ud788 \uc774\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ube44\uc804-\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LVLM) \ub610\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5\uc758 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\uba70, \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \ubc0f \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c \ucf58\ud150\uce20\ub97c \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0 \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\uc774 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc9c4\uc804\uc744 \uc774\ub04c\uc5b4\ub0b8 \ubc18\uba74, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uac00\uce58\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucd94\uac70\ub098 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc791\uc5c5 \ub610\ub294 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ucc38\uc5ec\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2ec\uce35 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(DRL)\uacfc \uc9c1\uc811 \uc120\ud638 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654(DPO)\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc870\uc815 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

This paper introduces \\texttt{BFS-Prover-V2}, a system\ndesigned to address this dual scaling problem. We present two primary\ninnovations. The first is a novel multi-turn off-policy RL framework for\ncontinually improving the performance of LLM step-prover at training time. This\nframework, inspired by the principles of AlphaZero, utilizes a multi-stage\nexpert iteration pipeline featuring adaptive tactic-level data filtering and\nperiodic retraining to surmount the performance plateaus that typically curtail\nlong-term RL in LLM-based agents. The second innovation is a planner-enhanced\nmulti-agent search architecture that scales reasoning capabilities at inference\ntime. This architecture employs a general reasoning model as a high-level\nplanner to iteratively decompose complex theorems into a sequence of simpler\nsubgoals. This hierarchical approach substantially reduces the search space,\nenabling a team of parallel prover agents to collaborate efficiently by\nleveraging a shared proof cache. We demonstrate that this dual approach to\nscaling yields state-of-the-art results on established formal mathematics\nbenchmarks. \\texttt{BFS-Prover-V2} achieves 95.08\\% and 41.4\\% on the MiniF2F\nand ProofNet test sets respectively. While demonstrated in the domain of formal\nmathematics, the RL and inference techniques presented in this work are of\nbroader interest and may be applied to other domains requiring long-horizon\nmulti-turn reasoning and complex search.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc790\ub3d9 \uc815\ub9ac \uc99d\uba85\uc744 \uc704\ud55c LLM\uc758 \ud655\uc7a5 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c

Existing paradigms divide into\n``Make AI Safe'', which applies post-hoc alignment and guardrails but remains\nbrittle and reactive, and ``Make Safe AI'', which emphasizes intrinsic safety\nbut struggles to address unforeseen risks in open-ended environments. We\ntherefore propose \\textit{safe-by-coevolution} as a new formulation of the\n``Make Safe AI'' paradigm, inspired by biological immunity, in which safety\nbecomes a dynamic, adversarial, and ongoing learning process. To operationalize\nthis vision, we introduce \\texttt{R$^2$AI} -- \\textit{Resistant and Resilient\nAI} -- as a practical framework that unites resistance against known threats\nwith resilience to unforeseen risks. \\texttt{R$^2$AI} integrates \\textit{fast\nand slow safe models}, adversarial simulation and verification through a\n\\textit{safety wind tunnel}, and continual feedback loops that guide safety and\ncapability to coevolve. We argue that this framework offers a scalable and\nproactive path to maintain continual safety in dynamic environments, addressing\nboth near-term vulnerabilities and long-term existential risks as AI advances\ntoward AGI and ASI.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131 \ubc1c\uc804\uc774 \uc9c0\uccb4\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c, \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 AI \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ub3d9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5 \uacfc\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \uc811\uadfc\ud558\uc5ec \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc548\uc804\uc131 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AI\uc758 \ube60\ub978 \ubc1c\uc804\uacfc \uc548\uc804\uc131 \uc9c4\uc804 \uac04\uc758 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uc18c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "'co-evolution\uc5d0 \uc758\ud55c \uc548\uc804\uc131'\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, 'R$^2$AI'\ub77c\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc54c\ub824\uc9c4 \uc704\ud611\uc5d0 \uc800\ud56d\ud558\uace0 \uc608\uae30\uce58 \ubabb\ud55c \uc704\ud5d8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud68c\ubcf5\ub825\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "R$^2$AI\ub294 \ube60\ub974\uace0 \ub290\ub9b0 \uc548\uc804 \ubaa8\ub378, \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ubc0f \uac80\uc99d, \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \ub8e8\ud504\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uc5ec \uc548\uc804\uc131\uacfc \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uacf5\ub3d9 \uc9c4\ud654\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc548\ub0b4\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, AI\uac00 AGI \ubc0f ASI\ub85c \ub098\uc544\uac00\uba74\uc11c \ub2e8\uae30 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uacfc \uc7a5\uae30 \uc874\uc7ac \uc704\ud5d8 \ubaa8\ub450\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8ec\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \ud3ec\uc9c0\uc158 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ube60\ub974\uac8c \uc131\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 AI \ub2a5\ub825\uacfc \uc774\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ub4a4\ucc98\uc9c4 \uc548\uc804\uc131 \ubc1c\uc804 \uac04\uc758 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8f9\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc740 'AI\ub97c \uc548\uc804\ud558\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4e4\uae30'\uc640 '\uc548\uc804\ud55c AI \ub9cc\ub4e4\uae30'\ub85c \ub098\ub258\uba70, \uc804\uc790\ub294 \uc0ac\ud6c4 \uc815\ub82c \ubc0f \uac00\ub4dc\ub808\uc77c\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\uace0 \ubc18\uc751\uc801\uc774\uba70, \ud6c4\uc790\ub294 \ub0b4\uc7ac\uc801 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uac1c\ubc29\ud615 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc608\uc0c1\uce58 \ubabb\ud55c \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801 \uba74\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc544 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc774 \ub3d9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc801\ub300\uc801\uc774\uba70 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5 \uacfc\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud558\ub294 '\ucf54-\uc9c4\ud654\uc5d0 \uc758\ud55c \uc548\uc804\uc131'\uc744 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ube44\uc804\uc744 \uc2e4\ud604\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc54c\ub824\uc9c4 \uc704\ud611\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc800\ud56d\uacfc \uc608\uae30\uce58 \uc54a\uc740 \uc704\ud5d8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud68c\ubcf5\ub825\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 R$^2$AI(\uc800\ud56d\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud68c\ubcf5\ub825 \uc788\ub294 AI)\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

In practice, training entire stacks end-to-end remains\nimpractical, so most work trains a single planner connected to core tools such\nas search, browsing, and code. While SFT imparts protocol fidelity, it suffers\nfrom imitation and exposure biases and underuses environment feedback.\nPreference alignment methods such as DPO are schema and proxy-dependent,\noff-policy, and weak for long-horizon credit assignment and multi-objective\ntrade-offs. A further limitation of SFT and DPO is their reliance on human\ndefined decision points and subskills through schema design and labeled\ncomparisons. Reinforcement learning aligns with closed-loop, tool-interaction\nresearch by optimizing trajectory-level policies, enabling exploration,\nrecovery behaviors, and principled credit assignment, and it reduces dependence\non such human priors and rater biases.\n  This survey is, to our knowledge, the first dedicated to the RL foundations\nof deep research systems. It systematizes work after DeepSeek-R1 along three\naxes: (i) data synthesis and curation; (ii) RL methods for agentic research\ncovering stability, sample efficiency, long context handling, reward and credit\ndesign, multi-objective optimization, and multimodal integration; and (iii)\nagentic RL training systems and frameworks. We also cover agent architecture\nand coordination, as well as evaluation and benchmarks, including recent QA,\nVQA, long-form synthesis, and domain-grounded, tool-interaction tasks.

Traditional oversampling\ntechniques, which are commonly used to alleviate class imbalance, have several\ndrawbacks: they treat features independently, lack similarity-based controls,\nlimit sample diversity, and fail to manage synthetic variety effectively. To\novercome these issues, we introduce AxelSMOTE, an innovative agent-based\napproach that views data instances as autonomous agents engaging in complex\ninteractions. Based on Axelrod's cultural dissemination model, AxelSMOTE\nimplements four key innovations: (1) trait-based feature grouping to preserve\ncorrelations; (2) a similarity-based probabilistic exchange mechanism for\nmeaningful interactions; (3) Beta distribution blending for realistic\ninterpolation; and (4) controlled diversity injection to avoid overfitting.\nExperiments on eight imbalanced datasets demonstrate that AxelSMOTE outperforms\nstate-of-the-art sampling methods while maintaining computational efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "AxelSMOTE\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd88\uade0\ud615 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud601\uc2e0\uc801\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc624\ubc84\uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \uae30\uc220\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub2e8\uc810\uc744 \uadf9\ubcf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud074\ub798\uc2a4 \ubd88\uade0\ud615\uc740 \uc18c\uc218 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc800\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "AxelSMOTE\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4\ub97c \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \ubcf4\uace0 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ud601\uc2e0\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c, \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \ud601\uc2e0\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc5ec\ub35f \uac1c\uc758 \ubd88\uade0\ud615 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, AxelSMOTE\ub294 \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "AxelSMOTE\ub294 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4 \ubd88\uade0\ud615 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud074\ub798\uc2a4 \ubd88\uade0\ud615\uc740 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub85c, \ud3b8\ud5a5\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc740 \uc18c\uc218 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc800\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc624\ubc84\uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \uae30\ubc95\uc740 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4 \ubd88\uade0\ud615\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub2e8\uc810\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4: \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uba70, \uc720\uc0ac\uc131 \uae30\ubc18 \uc81c\uc5b4\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uace0, \uc0d8\ud50c\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud558\uba70, \ud569\uc131 \ubcc0\ud615\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 AxelSMOTE\ub77c\ub294 \ud601\uc2e0\uc801\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4\ub97c \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \ubcf4\uace0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc0c1\ud638 \uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Traditional Function Calling (FC) approaches\noperate statelessly, requiring multiple exploratory calls to build\nenvironmental awareness before execution, leading to inefficiency and limited\nerror recovery. We introduce VehicleWorld, the first comprehensive environment\nfor the automotive domain, featuring 30 modules, 250 APIs, and 680 properties\nwith fully executable implementations that provide real-time state information\nduring agent execution. This environment enables precise evaluation of vehicle\nagent behaviors across diverse, challenging scenarios. Through systematic\nanalysis, we discovered that direct state prediction outperforms function\ncalling for environmental control. Building on this insight, we propose\nState-based Function Call (SFC), a novel approach that maintains explicit\nsystem state awareness and implements direct state transitions to achieve\ntarget conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that SFC significantly\noutperforms traditional FC approaches, achieving superior execution accuracy\nand reduced latency.

To explain the mechanism by which this is achieved, we reframe\nthe problem as that of learning a particular $3$-tensor, which we show is\ntypically of low rank. A key insight is that low-rank implementations of this\ntensor can be obtained by decomposing it along triplets of basic self-conjugate\nrepresentations of the group and leveraging the fusion structure to rule out\nmany components. Focusing on a phenomenologically similar but more tractable\nsurrogate model, we show that the network is able to find such low-rank\nimplementations (or approximations thereof), thereby using limited width to\napproximate the word-tensor in a generalizable way. In the case of the simple\nmultiplication word, we further elucidate the form of these low-rank\nimplementations, showing that the network effectively implements efficient\nmatrix multiplication in the sense of Strassen.

Evaluation capabilities that\ncurrently exist today (e.g., single pass LLM-as-a-judge) are limited in that\nthey often focus on individual metrics or capabilities, end-to-end outcomes,\nand are narrowly grounded on the preferences of humans. We argue that to match\nthe agentic capabilities, evaluation frameworks must also be able to reason,\nprobe, iterate, and understand the complex logic passing through these systems\nover long horizons. In this paper, we present RAFFLES - an evaluation\narchitecture that incorporates reasoning and iterative refinement.\nSpecifically, RAFFLES operates as an iterative, multi-component pipeline, using\na central Judge to systematically investigate faults and a set of specialized\nEvaluators to assess not only the system's components but also the quality of\nthe reasoning by the Judge itself, thereby building a history of hypotheses. We\ntested RAFFLES against several baselines on the Who&When dataset, a benchmark\ndesigned to diagnose the \"who\" (agent) and \"when\" (step) of a system's failure.\nRAFFLES outperforms these baselines, achieving an agent-step fault pair\naccuracy of over 43% on the Algorithmically-Generated dataset (a substantial\nincrease from the previously published best of 16.6%) and over 20% on the\nHand-Crafted dataset (surpassing the previously published best of 8.8%). These\nresults demonstrate a key step towards introducing automated fault detection\nfor autonomous systems over labor-intensive manual human review.", "AI": {"tldr": "RAFFLES\ub294 \uc7a5\uae30\uc801\uc778 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub85c, \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uacfc \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uc5ec \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uacb0\ud568\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc5d0\uc11c \uacb0\ud568\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0 \uadf8 \uc6d0\uc778\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud070 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc774 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00 \ub2a5\ub825\uc740 \ub2e8\uc77c \uce21\uc815 \uc9c0\ud45c\uc5d0 \uad6d\ud55c\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "RAFFLES\ub294 \uc911\uc559\uc5d0\uc11c \uacb0\ud568\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\ub294 \uc2ec\uc0ac\uad00\uacfc \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c \ubc0f \uc2ec\uc0ac\uad00\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uc804\ubb38 \ud3c9\uac00\uc790\ub4e4\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ub2e4\uc911 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b4\uc601\ub41c\ub2e4.", "result": "RAFFLES\ub294 Who&When \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc5ec\ub7ec \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ud588\uc73c\uba70, \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8-\ub2e8\uacc4 \uacb0\ud568 \uc30d \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uac00 43% \uc774\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\uc804\uc758 16.6%\uc5d0\uc11c \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\uc5c8\uace0, \uc218\uc791\uc5c5 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 20% \uc774\uc0c1\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "RAFFLES\ub294 \uc218\ub3d9\uc801 \uc778\uac04 \ub9ac\ubdf0 \ub300\uc2e0 \uc790\uc728 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uacb0\ud568 \uac10\uc9c0\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub2e8\uacc4\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc7a5\uae30\uc801\uc778 \ub2e4\uc911 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uac1c\ubc1c\uacfc \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc7a5\uc560\ubb3c\uc5d0 \ub3c4\ub2ec\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uc5b4\ub514\uc11c \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uace0\uc7a5\ub098\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uae30\uac00 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc5b4\ub835\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud604\uc7ac \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\ub294 \ud3c9\uac00 \ub2a5\ub825(\uc608: \ub2e8\uc77c \ud1b5\uacfc LLM-\uc2ec\uc0ac\uad00)\uc740 \uac1c\ubcc4 \uc9c0\ud45c\ub098 \ub2a5\ub825, \uc885\ud569\uc801\uc778 \uacb0\uacfc\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc120\ud638\ub3c4\uc5d0 \uc881\uac8c \uae30\ucd08\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \ud55c\uacc4\uac00 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825\uc5d0 \ubd80\ud569\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \ud3c9\uac00 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c \ub610\ud55c \uc624\ub79c \uae30\uac04 \ub3d9\uc548 \uc774 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ud1b5\uacfc\ud558\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub17c\ub9ac\ub97c \ucd94\ub860\ud558\uace0 \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\uba70 \ubc18\ubcf5\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ud574\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc5b4\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ucd94\ub860\uacfc \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \ud3c9\uac00 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc778 RAFFLES\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, RAFFLES\ub294 \uacb0\ud568\uc744 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\ub294 \uc911\uc559 \uc2ec\uc0ac\uad00\uacfc \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uc2ec\uc0ac\uad00 \uc790\uccb4\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uc804\ubb38 \ud3c9\uac00\uc790\ub4e4\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801 \ub2e4\uc911 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b4\uc601\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Paper2Agent transforms research output from passive\nartifacts into active systems that can accelerate downstream use, adoption, and\ndiscovery. Conventional research papers require readers to invest substantial\neffort to understand and adapt a paper's code, data, and methods to their own\nwork, creating barriers to dissemination and reuse. Paper2Agent addresses this\nchallenge by automatically converting a paper into an AI agent that acts as a\nknowledgeable research assistant. It systematically analyzes the paper and the\nassociated codebase using multiple agents to construct a Model Context Protocol\n(MCP) server, then iteratively generates and runs tests to refine and robustify\nthe resulting MCP. These paper MCPs can then be flexibly connected to a chat\nagent (e.g. Claude Code) to carry out complex scientific queries through\nnatural language while invoking tools and workflows from the original paper. We\ndemonstrate Paper2Agent's effectiveness in creating reliable and capable paper\nagents through in-depth case studies. Paper2Agent created an agent that\nleverages AlphaGenome to interpret genomic variants and agents based on ScanPy\nand TISSUE to carry out single-cell and spatial transcriptomics analyses. We\nvalidate that these paper agents can reproduce the original paper's results and\ncan correctly carry out novel user queries. By turning static papers into\ndynamic, interactive AI agents, Paper2Agent introduces a new paradigm for\nknowledge dissemination and a foundation for the collaborative ecosystem of AI\nco-scientists.", "AI": {"tldr": "Paper2Agent\ub294 \uc5f0\uad6c \ub17c\ubb38\uc744 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc5f0\uad6c \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub3c5\uc790\uac00 \ucf54\ub4dc\ub97c \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0 \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ub370 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ub178\ub825\uc744 \ub4e4\uc5ec\uc57c \ud558\ubbc0\ub85c \ud655\uc0b0\uacfc \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9\uc5d0 \uc7a5\ubcbd\uc744 \ub9cc\ub4e0\ub2e4.", "method": "Paper2Agent\ub294 \uc5f0\uad6c \ub17c\ubb38\uacfc \uad00\ub828 \ucf54\ub4dc\ubca0\uc774\uc2a4\ub97c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc5ec Model Context Protocol (MCP) \uc11c\ubc84\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uace0, \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uc2e4\ud589\ud558\uc5ec MCP\uc758 \uc815\ubc00\uc131\uacfc \uacac\uace0\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "Paper2Agent\ub294 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub17c\ubb38 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 AlphaGenome\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc720\uc804\uc790 \ubcc0\uc774\ub97c \ud574\uc11d\ud558\uace0, ScanPy \ubc0f TISSUE\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc138\ud3ec \ubc0f \uacf5\uac04 \uc804\uc0ac\uccb4 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Paper2Agent\ub294 \uc815\uc801 \ub17c\ubb38\uc744 \ub3d9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\uc5ec \uc9c0\uc2dd \ud655\uc0b0\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0 AI \uacf5\ub3d9 \uacfc\ud559\uc790 \uc0dd\ud0dc\uacc4\uc758 \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5f0\uad6c \ub17c\ubb38\uc744 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Paper2Agent\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However,\nthey exhibit two primary challenges: (1) they rely on multistep denoising with\ngradient computation for reward scoring, which is computationally expensive,\nthus restricting optimization to only a few diffusion steps; (2) they often\nneed continuous offline adaptation of reward models in order to achieve desired\naesthetic quality, such as photorealism or precise lighting effects. To address\nthe limitation of multistep denoising, we propose Direct-Align, a method that\npredefines a noise prior to effectively recover original images from any time\nsteps via interpolation, leveraging the equation that diffusion states are\ninterpolations between noise and target images, which effectively avoids\nover-optimization in late timesteps. Furthermore, we introduce Semantic\nRelative Preference Optimization (SRPO), in which rewards are formulated as\ntext-conditioned signals. This approach enables online adjustment of rewards in\nresponse to positive and negative prompt augmentation, thereby reducing the\nreliance on offline reward fine-tuning. By fine-tuning the FLUX model with\noptimized denoising and online reward adjustment, we improve its\nhuman-evaluated realism and aesthetic quality by over 3x.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc778\uccb4 \uc120\ud638\ub3c4\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub9de\ucdb0\uc9c4 \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ub514\ub178\uc774\uc9d5 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub192\uace0 \ubbf8\uc801 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc815\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "Direct-Align\ub77c\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec, \ub178\uc774\uc988\ub97c \uc0ac\uc804 \uc815\uc758\ud558\uc5ec \uc6d0\ubcf8 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf5\uc6d0\ud558\uace0, SRPO\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc870\uac74 \uc2e0\ud638\ub85c \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \ud45c\ud604\ud558\uc5ec \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "FLUX \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub41c \ub514\ub178\uc774\uc9d5\uacfc \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc870\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \uc778\uccb4 \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0\uc11c \ub9ac\uc5bc\ub9ac\uc998\uacfc \ubbf8\uc801 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 3\ubc30 \uc774\uc0c1 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf30\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \ubbf8\uc801 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uae30\uc5ec\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc \uc5f0\uad6c\ub4e4\uc740 \ucc28\ubcc4 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc120\ud638\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub9de\ucd94\ub294 \uac83\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\uc810\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4: (1) \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \ub9e4\uae30\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ub514\ub178\uc774\uc9d5\uacfc \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4e4\uc5b4 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uba87 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc758 \ud655\uc0b0\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\ud55c\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.
