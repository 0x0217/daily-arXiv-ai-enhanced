Applying DP requires making several\nimplementation decisions, each with significant impacts on data privacy and/or\nutility. Hence, to promote shared learning and accountability around DP\ndeployments, Dwork, Kohli, and Mulligan (2019) proposed a public-facing\nrepository (\"registry\") of DP deployments. The DP community has recently\nstarted to work toward realizing this vision. We contribute to this effort by\n(1) developing a holistic, hierarchical schema to describe any given DP\ndeployment and (2) designing and implementing an interactive interface to act\nas a registry where practitioners can access information about past DP\ndeployments. We (3) populate our interface with 21 real-world DP deployments\nand (4) conduct an exploratory user study with DP practitioners ($n=16$) to\nunderstand how they would use the registry, as well as what challenges and\nopportunities they foresee around its adoption. We find that participants were\nenthusiastic about the registry as a valuable resource for evaluating prior\ndeployments and making future deployments. They also identified several\nopportunities for the registry, including that it can become a \"hub\" for the\ncommunity and support broader communication around DP (e.g., to legal teams).\nAt the same time, they identified challenges around the registry gaining\nadoption, including the effort and risk involved with making implementation\nchoices public and moderating the quality of entries.

We found that conventional\napproaches that specify agent behaviors through implicit natural language\ndescriptions cannot yield consistent behaviors across models, and the produced\nagent behaviors do not capture the nuances of the descriptions. In contrast,\nCoBRA presents a new approach to program agents' cognitive biases explicitly,\nby grounding agents' expected behaviors using classic social science\nexperiments. CoBRA has two components: (1) Cognitive Bias Index that measures\nthe cognitive bias of a social agent, by quantifying the agent's reactions in a\nset of validated classical social science experiments; (2) Behavioral\nRegulation Engine that aligns the agent's behavior to demonstrate controlled\ncognitive bias. We evaluated CoBRA as an HCI toolkit through demonstration and\ntechnical benchmarks. Our results suggest that CoBRA can precisely program the\ncognitive bias demonstrated in a social agent in a model-agnostic manner."}

To overcome these limitations, we propose THOR\n(Tool-Integrated Hierarchical Optimization via RL).
