Current practices are hindered by fragmented data streams, siloed\ntechnologies, resource constraints, and the erosion of institutional memory,\nwhich collectively impede timely and effective decision making. This study\nintroduces Disaster Copilot, a vision for a multi-agent artificial intelligence\nsystem designed to overcome these systemic challenges by unifying specialized\nAI tools within a collaborative framework. The proposed architecture utilizes a\ncentral orchestrator to coordinate diverse sub-agents, each specializing in\ncritical domains such as predictive risk analytics, situational awareness, and\nimpact assessment. By integrating multi-modal data, the system delivers a\nholistic, real-time operational picture and serve as the essential AI backbone\nrequired to advance Disaster Digital Twins from passive models to active,\nintelligent environments. Furthermore, it ensures functionality in\nresource-limited environments through on-device orchestration and incorporates\nmechanisms to capture institutional knowledge, mitigating the impact of staff\nturnover. We detail the system architecture and propose a three-phased roadmap\nemphasizing the parallel growth of technology, organizational capacity, and\nhuman-AI teaming. Disaster Copilot offers a transformative vision, fostering\ncollective human-machine intelligence to build more adaptive, data-driven and\nresilient communities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc7ac\ub09c

Prior work often either selects a pretrained policy based on\nan inferred model of the new teammates or pretrains a single policy that is\nrobust to potential teammates. Instead, we propose to leverage all pretrained\npolicies in a zero-shot transfer setting. We formalize this problem as an ad\nhoc multi-agent Markov decision process and present a solution that uses two\nkey ideas, generalized policy improvement and difference rewards, for efficient\nand effective knowledge transfer between different teams. We empirically\ndemonstrate that our algorithm, Generalized Policy improvement for Ad hoc\nTeaming (GPAT), successfully enables zero-shot transfer to new teams in three\nsimulated environments: cooperative foraging, predator-prey, and Overcooked.

However, most\nexisting approaches treat evaluation as a black box, relying solely on\nnumerical scores while offering limited insight into why a prompt succeeds or\nfails. They also depend heavily on trial-and-error refinements, which are\ndifficult to interpret and control. In this paper, we introduce MA-SAPO, a\nMulti-Agent framework for Score-Aware Prompt Optimization. Compared to prior\nmethods, MA-SAPO explicitly couples evaluation outcomes with structured\nreasoning to guide systematic edits. The framework specifically consists of two\nstages: during the Reasoning Phase, agents collaboratively explain metric\nscores, diagnose weaknesses, and synthesize targeted refinements that are\nstored as reusable reasoning assets; during the Test Phase, agents retrieve\nthese assets to analyze optimized prompts and apply only evidence-grounded\nedits. By turning evaluation signals into interpretable reasoning chains,\nMA-SAPO produces prompt refinements that are more transparent, auditable, and\ncontrollable.

Yet\nthis advancement is intrinsically linked to new vulnerabilities, as GenAI\nlowers the barrier to misuse and introduces novel biosecurity threats, such as\ngenerating synthetic viral proteins or toxins. These dual-use risks are often\noverlooked, as existing safety guardrails remain fragile and can be\ncircumvented through deceptive prompts or jailbreak techniques. In this\nPerspective, we first outline the current state of GenAI in the biosciences and\nemerging threat vectors ranging from jailbreak attacks and privacy risks to the\ndual-use challenges posed by autonomous AI agents. We then examine urgent gaps\nin regulation and oversight, drawing on insights from 130 expert interviews\nacross academia, government, industry, and policy. A large majority ($\\approx\n76$\\%) expressed concern over AI misuse in biology, and 74\\% called for the\ndevelopment of new governance frameworks. Finally, we explore technical\npathways to mitigation, advocating a multi-layered approach to GenAI safety.\nThese defenses include rigorous data filtering, alignment with ethical\nprinciples during development, and real-time monitoring to block harmful\nrequests. Together, these strategies provide a blueprint for embedding security\nthroughout the GenAI lifecycle. As GenAI becomes integrated into the\nbiosciences, safeguarding this frontier requires an immediate commitment to\nboth adaptive governance and secure-by-design technologies.", "AI": {"tldr":

This\npaper introduces the Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL) as an executable\nepistemological framework for emergent intelligence. Unlike traditional AI\nresearch asking \"what is intelligence?\" (ontological), SCL asks \"under what\nconditions does cognition emerge?\" (epistemological). Grounded in philosophy of\nmind and cognitive phenomenology, SCL bridges conceptual philosophy and\nimplementable cognition. Drawing on process philosophy, enactive cognition, and\nextended mind theory, we define intelligence not as a property but as a\nperformed process -- a continuous loop of judgment, memory, control, action,\nand regulation. SCL makes three contributions. First, it operationalizes\nphilosophical insights into computationally interpretable structures, enabling\n\"executable epistemology\" -- philosophy as structural experiment. Second, it\nshows that functional separation within cognitive architecture yields more\ncoherent and interpretable behavior than monolithic prompt based systems,\nsupported by agent evaluations. Third, it redefines intelligence: not\nrepresentational accuracy but the capacity to reconstruct its own epistemic\nstate through intentional understanding. This framework impacts philosophy of\nmind, epistemology, and AI. For philosophy, it allows theories of cognition to\nbe enacted and tested. For AI, it grounds behavior in epistemic structure\nrather than statistical regularity. For epistemology, it frames knowledge not\nas truth possession but as continuous reconstruction within a\nphenomenologically coherent loop. We situate SCL within debates on cognitive\nphenomenology, emergence, normativity, and intentionality, arguing that real\nprogress requires not larger models but architectures that realize cognitive\nprinciples structurally.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc9c4\uc815\ud55c \uc778\uc2dd\uc801 \uc774\ud574 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc9c4\uc815\ud55c \uc778\uc2dd\uc801 \uc774\ud574\uac00 \uacb0\uc5ec\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "Structured Cognitive Loop(SCL)\ub77c\ub294 \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc778\uc2dd\ub860\uc801 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec, \uc778\uc2dd\uc758 \ucd9c\ud604 \uc870\uac74\uc744 \uba85\ud655\ud788 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "SCL\uc740 \ucca0\ud559\uc801 \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc744 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud130 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\ub85c \ubcc0\ud654\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0, \uc778\uc9c0 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uae30\ub2a5\uc801 \ubd84\ub9ac\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uace0 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc774\ub04c\uc5b4\ub0b8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "SCL\uc740 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc744 \uc7ac\uc815\uc758\ud558\uba70, \ud604\uc7ac \uc9c0\uc2dd \uad6c\uc870\ub294 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \uaddc\uc728\uc774 \uc544\ub2cc \uc778\uc2dd\uc801 \uad6c\uc870\uc5d0 \uae30\ucd08\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc9c4\uc815\ud55c \uc778\uc2dd\uc801 \uc774\ud574 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc778\uc2dd\uc801 \uad6c\uc870\uc758 \ubd80\uc7ac\ub77c\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ucd9c\ud604 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc778\uc2dd\ub860\uc801 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c\uc11c \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc778\uc9c0 \ub8e8\ud504(Structured Cognitive Loop, SCL)\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 AI \uc5f0\uad6c\uac00 '\uc9c0\ub2a5\uc774\ub780 \ubb34\uc5c7\uc778\uac00?'(\uc874\uc7ac\ub860\uc801 \uc9c8\ubb38)\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd98 \ubc18\uba74, SCL\uc740 '\uc778\uc9c0\uac00 \uc5b4\ub5a4 \uc870\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd9c\ud604\ud558\ub294\uac00?'(\uc778\uc2dd\ub860\uc801 \uc9c8\ubb38)\ub97c \ubb3b\ub294\ub2e4.

Traditional methods for EEG signal\nclassification, which rely on expert visual review, are becoming increasingly\nimpractical due to the growing complexity and volume of EEG recordings.\nLeveraging a publicly available annotated dataset from Mayo Clinic and St.\nAnne's University Hospital, the WaveNet model was trained, validated, and\ntested on 209,232 samples with a 70/20/10 percent split. The model achieved a\nclassification accuracy exceeding previous CNN and LSTM-based approaches, and\nwas benchmarked against a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) baseline.\nNotably, the model distinguishes noise and artifacts with high precision,\nalthough it reveals a modest but explainable degree of misclassification\nbetween physiological and pathological signals, reflecting inherent clinical\noverlap. WaveNet's architecture, originally developed for raw audio synthesis,\nis well suited for EEG data due to its use of dilated causal convolutions and\nresidual connections, enabling it to capture both fine-grained and long-range\ntemporal dependencies.

To address verbosity and stakeholder trade-offs, we\nintegrate four mechanisms: (i) plasticity, which applies concise adjustments to\ncandidate solutions; (ii) duplication and maturation, which copy\nhigh-performing candidates and specialize them into new modules; (iii)\nranked-choice stakeholder aggregation using influence-weighted Borda scoring;\nand (iv) compute awareness via token-based penalties that reward brevity. The\nsystem iteratively proposes diverse strategies, applies plasticity tweaks,\nsimulates stakeholder evaluations, aggregates preferences, selects top\ncandidates, and performs duplication/maturation while factoring compute cost\ninto final scores. In a controlled evaluation over 30 rounds comparing 14\nsystems, Lark Full achieves a mean rank of 2.55 (95% CI [2.17, 2.93]) and a\nmean composite score of 29.4/50 (95% CI [26.34, 32.46]), finishing Top-3 in 80%\nof rounds while remaining cost competitive with leading commercial models\n($0.016 per task). Paired Wilcoxon tests confirm that all four mechanisms\ncontribute significantly as ablating duplication/maturation yields the largest\ndeficit ({\\Delta}Score = 3.5, Cohen's d_z = 2.53, p < 0.001), followed by\nplasticity ({\\Delta}Score = 3.4, d_z = 1.86), ranked-choice voting\n({\\Delta}Score = 2.4, d_z = 1.20), and token penalties ({\\Delta}Score = 2.2,\nd_z = 1.63). Rather than a formal Markov Decision Process with constrained\noptimization, Lark is a practical, compute-aware neuroevolutionary loop that\nscales stakeholder-aligned strategy generation and makes trade-offs transparent\nthrough per-step metrics.

While MCP unlocks broad\ninteroperability, it also enlarges the attack surface by making tools\nfirst-class, composable objects with natural-language metadata, and\nstandardized I/O. We present MSB (MCP Security Benchmark), the first end-to-end\nevaluation suite that systematically measures how well LLM agents resist\nMCP-specific attacks throughout the full tool-use pipeline: task planning, tool\ninvocation, and response handling. MSB contributes: (1) a taxonomy of 12\nattacks including name-collision, preference manipulation, prompt injections\nembedded in tool descriptions, out-of-scope parameter requests,\nuser-impersonating responses, false-error escalation, tool-transfer, retrieval\ninjection, and mixed attacks; (2) an evaluation harness that executes attacks\nby running real tools (both benign and malicious) via MCP rather than\nsimulation; and (3) a robustness metric that quantifies the trade-off between\nsecurity and performance: Net Resilient Performance (NRP). We evaluate nine\npopular LLM agents across 10 domains and 400+ tools, producing 2,000 attack\ninstances. Results reveal the effectiveness of attacks against each stage of\nMCP. Models with stronger performance are more vulnerable to attacks due to\ntheir outstanding tool calling and instruction following capabilities. MSB\nprovides a practical baseline for researchers and practitioners to study,\ncompare, and harden MCP agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "MCP\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc678\ubd80 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uace0 \uc124\uba85\ud558\uba70 \ud638\ucd9c\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ud45c\uc900\ud654\ud558\uba70, MSB\ub294 MCP \ud2b9\uc815 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ub0b4\uc131\uc744 \uce21\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \uc885\ub2e8 \uac04 \ud3c9\uac00 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "MCP\ub294 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \uc678\ubd80 \ub3c4\uad6c \uac04\uc758 \ud638\ud658\uc131\uc744 \uc99d\uc9c4\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uacf5\uaca9 \ud45c\uba74\uc744 \ud655\ub300\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf4\uc548 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "method": "MSB\ub294 12\uac00\uc9c0 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc720\ud615\uacfc \uc774\ub4e4\uc744 \uc2e4\ud589\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\uc81c \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ud3c9\uac00 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \ubcf4\uc548\uacfc \uc131\ub2a5 \uac04\uc758 \ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ub4dc\uc624\ud504\ub97c \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uac15\uac74\uc131 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "MSB\ub294 9\uac1c\uc758 \ub300\uc911\uc801\uc778 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc5ec 2,000\uac1c\uc758 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uac01 MCP \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacf5\uaca9\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "MSB\ub294 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc790\uc640 \uc2e4\ubb34\uc790\uac00 MCP \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc5f0\uad6c \ubc0f \uac15\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubaa8\ub378 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c(MCP)\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc678\ubd80 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uace0 \uc124\uba85\ud558\uba70 \ud638\ucd9c\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ud45c\uc900\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

To enhance the forecasting accuracy of active fires, data\nassimilation plays a vital role by integrating observations (such as\nremote-sensing data) and fire predictions generated from numerical models. This\npaper provides a comprehensive investigation on the application of a recently\nproposed diffusion-model-based filtering algorithm -- the Ensemble Score Filter\n(EnSF) -- to the data assimilation problem for real-time active wildfire spread\npredictions.

We reformulate this challenge\n(Privacy-Conscious Delegation) as a sequential decision-making problem and\nintroduce a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework called PrivacyPAD to\nsolve it. Our framework trains an agent to dynamically route text chunks,\nlearning a policy that optimally balances the trade-off between privacy leakage\nand task performance. It implicitly distinguishes between replaceable\nPersonally Identifiable Information (PII) (which it shields locally) and\ntask-critical PII (which it strategically sends to the remote model for maximal\nutility). To validate our approach in complex scenarios, we also introduce a\nnew medical dataset with high PII density.

In\nsubsequent discourse, questions have arisen as to whether the nature of the\ntask muddles an evaluation of true reasoning. One potential confound is the\nrequirement that the model keep track of the state space on its own. We provide\na large language model (LLM) with an environment interface for Tower of Hanoi\nproblems, allowing it to make a move with a tool call, provide written\njustification, observe the resulting state space, and reprompt itself for the\nnext move. We observe that access to an environment interface does not delay or\neradicate performance collapse. Furthermore, LLM-parameterized policy analysis\nreveals increasing divergence from both optimal policies and uniformly random\npolicies, suggesting that the model exhibits mode-like collapse at each level\nof complexity, and that performance is dependent upon whether the mode reflects\nthe correct solution for the problem. We suggest that a similar phenomena might\ntake place in LRMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub378(LRM)\uc740 \ud2b9\uc815 \ub09c\uc774\ub3c4 \uc774\uc0c1\uc5d0\uc11c

We\nintroduce \\textit{LinearizeLLM}, an agent-based framework that solves this task\nby leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework assigns each\nnonlinear pattern to a \\textit{reformulation agent} that is explicitly\ninstructed to derive an exact linear reformulation for its nonlinearity\npattern, for instance, absolute-value terms or bilinear products of decision\nvariables.

To benchmark the approach, we create a\ndataset of 20 real-world nonlinear optimization problems derived from the\nestablished ComplexOR dataset of linear optimization problems.

This lead its\nauthors to argue that the benchmark domains on which negotiation algorithms are\ntypically tested may be too simplistic. However, one question that was left\nopen, was how MiCRO could be generalized to multilateral negotiations. In this\npaper we fill this gap by introducing a multilateral variant of MiCRO. We\ncompare it with the winners of the Automated Negotiating Agents Competitions\n(ANAC) of 2015, 2017 and 2018 and show that it outperforms them.

Existing defenses often fall short due to reactive\ndesigns or centralized architectures which may introduce single points of\nfailure. To address these challenges, we propose SentinelNet, the first\ndecentralized framework for proactively detecting and mitigating malicious\nbehaviors in multi-agent collaboration. SentinelNet equips each agent with a\ncredit-based detector trained via contrastive learning on augmented adversarial\ndebate trajectories, enabling autonomous evaluation of message credibility and\ndynamic neighbor ranking via bottom-k elimination to suppress malicious\ncommunications. To overcome the scarcity of attack data, it generates\nadversarial trajectories simulating diverse threats, ensuring robust training.\nExperiments on MAS benchmarks show SentinelNet achieves near-perfect detection\nof malicious agents, close to 100% within two debate rounds, and recovers 95%\nof system accuracy from compromised baselines.

However, previous\nworks rely upon activating LLMs' inherent capacities through fixed prompt\ntemplates. This strategy introduces substantial sampling inefficiencies for\nweak LLMs, as the majority of problems generate invalid outputs during\naccuracy-driven filtration in reasoning tasks, which causes a waste of samples.\nTo solve this issue, we propose Cog-Rethinker, a novel hierarchical\nmetacognitive RL framework for LLM reasoning. Our Cog-Rethinker mainly focuses\non the rollout procedure in RL training. After the direct rollout, our\nCog-Rethinker improves sample utilization in a hierarchical metacognitive\ntwo-stage framework. By leveraging human cognition during solving problems,\nfirstly, it prompts policy to decompose zero-accuracy problems into subproblems\nto produce final reasoning results.

Particularly\nconcerning, such attacks may avoid detection with datasets that are only\nimplicitly harmful. Our work studies robust detection mechanisms for\nadversarial use of fine-tuning APIs. We introduce the concept of a fine-tuning\nauditing agent and show it can detect harmful fine-tuning prior to model\ndeployment. We provide our auditing agent with access to the fine-tuning\ndataset, as well as the fine-tuned and pre-fine-tuned models, and request the\nagent assigns a risk score for the fine-tuning job. We evaluate our detection\napproach on a diverse set of eight strong fine-tuning attacks from the\nliterature, along with five benign fine-tuned models, totaling over 1400\nindependent audits. These attacks are undetectable with basic content\nmoderation on the dataset, highlighting the challenge of the task. With the\nbest set of affordances, our auditing agent achieves a 56.2% detection rate of\nadversarial fine-tuning at a 1% false positive rate. Most promising, the\nauditor is able to detect covert cipher attacks that evade safety evaluations\nand content moderation of the dataset.

We present TEAM-PHI, a multi-agent evaluation and selection\nframework that uses large language models (LLMs) to automatically measure\nde-identification quality and select the best-performing model without heavy\nreliance on gold labels. TEAM-PHI deploys multiple Evaluation Agents, each\nindependently judging the correctness of PHI extractions and outputting\nstructured metrics. Their results are then consolidated through an LLM-based\nmajority voting mechanism that integrates diverse evaluator perspectives into a\nsingle, stable, and reproducible ranking. Experiments on a real-world clinical\nnote corpus demonstrate that TEAM-PHI produces consistent and accurate\nrankings: despite variation across individual evaluators, LLM-based voting\nreliably converges on the same top-performing systems. Further comparison with\nground-truth annotations and human evaluation confirms that the framework's\nautomated rankings closely match supervised evaluation.

Previous\nstudies have proposed various discrepancy metrics, but the capacity gap and\ntraining instability caused by near-zero probabilities, stemming from the\nhigh-dimensional output of LLMs, remain fundamental limitations. To overcome\nthese challenges, several approaches implicitly or explicitly incorporating\nassistant distribution have recently been proposed. However, the past proposals\nof assistant distributions have been a fragmented approach without a systematic\ninvestigation of the interpolation path and the divergence. This paper proposes\n$\\alpha$-mixture assistant distribution, a novel generalized family of\nassistant distributions, and $\\alpha$-mixture distillation, coined AMiD, a\nunified framework for KD using the assistant distribution. The $\\alpha$-mixture\nassistant distribution provides a continuous extension of the assistant\ndistribution by introducing a new distribution design variable $\\alpha$, which\nhas been fixed in all previous approaches.

We propose ATOS (Attack\nThrough Overlapping Sparsity), a differentiable optimization framework that\ngenerates structured, sparse adversarial perturbations in element-wise,\npixel-wise, and group-wise forms. For white-box attacks on image classifiers,\nwe introduce the Overlapping Smoothed L0 (OSL0) function, which promotes\nconvergence to a stationary point while encouraging sparse, structured\nperturbations. By grouping channels and adjacent pixels, ATOS improves\ninterpretability and helps identify robust versus non-robust features.

Tonguz", "Federico Taschin"], "title": "Using Kolmogorov-Smirnov Distance for Measuring Distribution Shift in Machine Learning", "comment": null, "summary": "One of the major problems in Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial\nIntelligence (AI) is the fact that the probability distribution of the test\ndata in the real world could deviate substantially from the probability\ndistribution of the training data set. When this happens, the predictions of an\nML system or an AI agent could involve large errors which is very troublesome\nand undesirable. While this is a well-known hard problem plaguing the AI and ML\nsystems' accuracy and reliability, in certain applications such errors could be\ncritical for safety and reliability of AI and ML systems. One approach to deal\nwith this problem is to monitor and measure the deviation in the probability\ndistribution of the test data in real time and to compensate for this\ndeviation. In this paper, we propose and explore the use of Kolmogorov-Smirnov\n(KS) Test for measuring the distribution shift and we show how the KS distance\ncan be used to quantify the distribution shift and its impact on an AI agent's\nperformance. Our results suggest that KS distance could be used as a valuable\nstatistical tool for monitoring and measuring the distribution shift. More\nspecifically, it is shown that even a distance of KS=0.02 could lead to about\n50\\% increase in the travel time at a single intersection using a Reinforcement\nLearning agent which is quite significant. It is hoped that the use of KS Test\nand KS distance in AI-based smart transportation could be an important step\nforward for gauging the performance degradation of an AI agent in real time and\nthis, in turn, could help the AI agent to cope with the distribution shift in a\nmore informed manner.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 AI \ubc0f ML \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc800\ud558\ub97c \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ud655\ub960 \ubd84\ud3ec \uac04 \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\ud558\uc5ec AI \ubc0f ML \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uacfc \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubd84\ud3ec \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \uce21\uc815\ud558\uace0 KS \uac70\ub9ac\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \uc218\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "KS \uac70\ub9ac\ub294 \ubd84\ud3ec \ubcc0\ud654 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\uc5d0 \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, KS=0.02\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0 \uad50\ucc28\ub85c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc57d 50%\uc758 \uc5ec\ud589 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc99d\uac00\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "KS \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc640 KS \uac70\ub9ac\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c AI \uae30\ubc18 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uad50\ud1b5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uad6c\ud604\uc774 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc800\ud558 \uce21\uc815\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ubc1c\uc804\uc774 \ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5(ML) \ubc0f \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5(AI)\uc5d0\uc11c \uc8fc\uc694 \ubb38\uc81c \uc911 \ud558\ub098\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc138\uacc4\uc758 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud655\ub960 \ubd84\ud3ec\uac00 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc758 \ud655\ub960 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc640 \ud06c\uac8c \uc77c\uce58\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7f0 \uc77c\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uba74 ML \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774\ub098 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0\uc11c \ud070 \uc624\ub958\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ubc88\uac70\ub86d\uace0 \ubc14\ub78c\uc9c1\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc624\ub958\ub294 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0\uc11c AI \ubc0f ML \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uacfc \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc5d0 \uce58\uba85\uc801\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud55c \uac00\uc9c0 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ud655\ub960 \ubd84\ud3ec \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\ud558\uace0 \uce21\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub97c \ubcf4\uc0c1\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubd84\ud3ec \uc774\ub3d9 \uce21\uc815\uc744 \uc704\ud574 Kolmogorov-Smirnov(KS) \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc758 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\uba70, KS \uac70\ub9ac\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubd84\ud3ec \uc774\ub3d9\uacfc \uadf8\uac83\uc774 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 KS \uac70\ub9ac\uac00 \ubd84\ud3ec \uc774\ub3d9\uc744 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\ud558\uace0 \uce21\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub354 \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, KS=0.02\uc758 \uac70\ub9ac\ub3c4 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0 \ub2e8\uc77c \uad50\ucc28\ub85c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc57d 50%\uc758 \uc5ec\ud589 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc99d\uac00\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Despite their power, these workflows face two\ncentral obstacles: (1) high computational cost, since accurate exploration\nrequires many expensive simulator runs; and (2) limited transparency and\nreliability when decisions rely on opaque blackbox components. We propose a\nworkflow that addresses both challenges by training lightweight emulators on\ncompact designs of experiments that (i) provide fast, low-latency\napproximations of expensive simulators, (ii) enable rigorous uncertainty\nquantification, and (iii) are adapted for global and local Explainable\nArtificial Intelligence (XAI) analyses. This workflow unifies every\nsimulation-based complex-system analysis tool, ranging from engineering design\nto agent-based models for socio-environmental understanding. In this paper, we\nproposea comparative methodology and practical recommendations for using\nsurrogate-based explainability tools within the proposed workflow. The\nmethodology supports continuous and categorical inputs, combines global-effect\nand uncertainty analyses with local attribution, and evaluates the consistency\nof explanations across surrogate models, thereby diagnosing surrogate adequacy\nand guiding further data collection or model refinement. We demonstrate the\napproach on two contrasting case studies: a multidisciplinary design analysis\nof a hybrid-electric aircraft and an agent-based model of urban segregation.\nResults show that the surrogate model and XAI coupling enables large-scale\nexploration in seconds, uncovers nonlinear interactions and emergent behaviors,\nidentifies key design and policy levers, and signals regions where surrogates\nrequire more data or alternative architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158

As operations move to minute-- and\nsecond--level feedback, communication security shifts from a compliance item to\nan operational constraint: latency, reliability, and confidentiality jointly\ndetermine whether dispatch, protection, and settlement signals arrive on time.\nConventional PKI and key-rotation schemes struggle with cross-domain,\nhigh-frequency messaging and face long-term quantum threats. Quantum key\ndistribution (QKD) offers information-theoretic key freshness, but its key\nyield is scarce and stochastic, often misaligned with bursty VPP traffic. This\npaper proposes a key-aware priority and quota framework that treats quantum\nkeys as first-class scheduling resources. The design combines (i)\nforecast-driven long-term quotas and short-term tokens, (ii) key-aware\ndeficit-round-robin arbitration, (iii) a preemptive emergency key reserve, and\n(iv) graceful degradation via encryption-mode switching and controlled\ndown-sampling for non-critical traffic. A drift-plus-penalty analysis\nestablishes strong stability under average supply--demand balance with\nquantifiable bounds on backlog and tail latency, providing interpretable\noperating guarantees. We build a reproducible testbed on IEEE 33- and 123-bus\nVPP systems and evaluate normal, degraded, and outage regimes with\nindustry-consistent message classes and TTLs. Against FIFO, fixed-priority, and\nstatic-quota baselines, the proposed scheme consistently reduces tail delay and\npassive timeouts for critical messages, improves per-bit key utility, and\nenhances power-tracking reliability during key scarcity and regime switches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc591\uc790 \ud0a4 \ubd84\ubc30\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uac00\uc0c1 \ubc1c\uc804\uc18c\uc758 \ud0a4 \uad00\ub9ac \ubc29\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uac00\uc0c1 \ubc1c\uc804\uc18c(VPP)\uac00 \ubbf8\ub798 \uc804\ub825\ub9dd\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec\uc774 \ub418\uba74\uc11c \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ubcf4\uc548\uc774 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc6b4\uc601 \uc81c\uc57d\uc774 \ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc591\uc790 \ud0a4\ub97c \uc77c\uae09 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\ub9c1 \uc790\uc6d0\uc73c\ub85c \uac04\uc8fc\ud558\ub294 \ud0a4 \uc778\uc2dd \uc6b0\uc120 \uc21c\uc704 \ubc0f \ucffc\ud130 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc7a5\uae30 \ubc0f \ub2e8\uae30 \ud560\ub2f9, \ud0a4 \uc778\uc2dd \uacb0\ud54d \ub77c\uc6b4\ub4dc \ub85c\ube48 \uc911\uc7ac, \ube44\uc0c1 \ud0a4 \uc608\ube44, \uc554\ud638\ud654 \ubaa8\ub4dc \uc804\ud658 \ub4f1\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ube44\ud575\uc2ec \ud2b8\ub798\ud53d\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud558\uac15 \uc5f0\uc18d\uc131 \ubc0f \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uba70, \uc8fc\uc694 \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0\uc758 \uaf2c\ub9ac \uc9c0\uc5f0 \ubc0f \uc218\ub3d9 \ud0c0\uc784\uc544\uc6c3\uc744 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uc904\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc591\uc790 \ud0a4 \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uc2dc \uc804\ub825 \ucd94\uc801 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uace0, VPP \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud56d\ubaa9 \ubcc4 \ud0a4 \ud65c\uc6a9\ub3c4\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac00\uc0c1 \ubc1c\uc804\uc18c(VPP)\ub294 \uc2dc\uc7a5 \ucc38\uc5ec \ubc0f \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ubd84\uc0b0\ud615 PV, \ud48d\ub825, \uc800\uc7a5\uc18c \ubc0f \uc720\uc5f0\ud55c \ubd80\ud558\ub97c \uc9d1\ud569\ud654\ud558\uba70 \ubbf8\ub798\uc758 \uc804\ub825\ub9dd\uc758 \ucd08\uc11d\uc774 \ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc6b4\uc601\uc774 \ubd84 \ub2e8\uc704 \ubc0f \ucd08 \ub2e8\uc704\uc758 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\ub3d9\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ubcf4\uc548\uc740 \uc900\uc218 \ud56d\ubaa9\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b4\uc601 \uc81c\uc57d\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\ud658\ub41c\ub2e4: \uc9c0\uc5f0, \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \ubc0f \uae30\ubc00\uc131\uc774 \ud568\uaed8 \ub514\uc2a4\ud328\uce58, \ubcf4\ud638 \ubc0f \uc815\uc0b0 \uc2e0\ud638\uac00 \uc81c\ub54c \ub3c4\ucc29\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uacb0\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 PKI \ubc0f \ud0a4 \ud68c\uc804 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uac04\uc758 \uace0\uc8fc\ud30c \uba54\uc2dc\uc9d5\uacfc \uc7a5\uae30\uc801\uc778 \uc591\uc790 \uc704\ud611\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc591\uc790 \ud0a4 \ubd84\ubc30(QKD)\ub294 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ud0a4 \uc2e0\uc120\ub3c4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uadf8 \ud0a4 \uc0dd\uc0b0\ub7c9\uc740 \ub4dc\ubb3c\uace0 \ud655\ub960\uc801\uc774\uba70, \uacbd\uae30\uc801\uc778 VPP \ud2b8\ub798\ud53d\uacfc \uc885\uc885 \uc815\ub82c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc591\uc790 \ud0a4\ub97c \uc77c\uae09 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\ub9c1 \uc790\uc6d0\uc73c\ub85c \ucde8\uae09\ud558\ub294 \ud0a4 \uc778\uc2dd \uc6b0\uc120 \uc21c\uc704 \ubc0f \ucffc\ud130 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc124\uacc4\ub294 (i) \uc608\uce21 \uae30\ubc18 \uc7a5\uae30 \ucffc\ud130\uc640 \ub2e8\uae30 \ud1a0\ud070, (ii) \ud0a4 \uc778\uc2dd \uacb0\ud54d \ub77c\uc6b4\ub4dc \ub85c\ube48 \uc911\uc7ac, (iii) \uc120\uc81c\uc801 \ube44\uc0c1 \ud0a4 \uc608\ube44, \ubc0f (iv) \ube44\ud575\uc2ec \ud2b8\ub798\ud53d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc554\ud638\ud654 \ubaa8\ub4dc \uc804\ud658 \ubc0f \uc81c\uc5b4\ub41c \ub2e4\uc6b4 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \uc6b0\uc544\ud55c \uc800\ud558\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub4dc\ub9ac\ud504\ud2b8-\ud50c\ub7ec\uc2a4-\ud398\ub110\ud2f0 \ubd84\uc11d\uc740 \ud3c9\uade0 \uacf5\uae09-\uc218\uc694 \uade0\ud615 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ud55c \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ud655\ub9bd\ud558\uace0, \ubc31\ub85c\uadf8 \ubc0f \uaf2c\ub9ac \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc815\ub7c9\uc801 \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc5ec \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc6b4\uc601 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 IEEE 33 \ubc0f 123\ubc84\uc2a4 VPP \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc7ac\ud604 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ubca0\ub4dc\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uace0 \uc0b0\uc5c5 \uc77c\uad00\uc131 \uc788\ub294 \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4\uc640 TTL\ub85c \uc815\uc0c1, \uc800\ud558, \ubc0f \uc911\ub2e8 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4.

To further enhance LLM\ncapabilities, recent agentic systems, such as Deep Research, incorporate web\ninteractions into LLM reasoning to mitigate uncertainties and reduce potential\nerrors. However, existing research predominantly focuses on reasoning\nperformance, often neglecting the efficiency of agentic systems. In this work,\nwe present a comprehensive empirical study that identifies efficiency\nbottlenecks in web-interactive agentic systems. We decompose end-to-end latency\ninto two primary components: LLM API latency and web environment latency. We\nconduct a comprehensive empirical study across 15 models and 5 providers to\ndemonstrate high variability in API-based agentic systems. We observe that web\nenvironment latency can contribute as much as 53.7% to the overall latency in a\nweb-based agentic system. To improve latency, we propose SpecCache, a caching\nframework augmented with speculative execution that can reduce web environment\noverhead.

Existing TSFMs often overlook the distinct categorical nature of state\nvariables and their critical role as conditions, typically treating them\nuniformly with numerical variables. This inappropriate modeling approach\nprevents the model from fully leveraging state information and even leads to a\nsignificant degradation in detection performance after state variables are\nintegrated. To address this critical limitation, this paper proposes a novel\nSTate-aware AdapteR (STAR). STAR is a plug-and-play module designed to enhance\nthe capability of TSFMs in modeling and leveraging state variables during the\nfine-tuning stage. Specifically, STAR comprisesthree core components: (1) We\ndesign an Identity-guided State Encoder, whicheffectively captures the complex\ncategorical semantics of state variables through a learnable State Memory. (2)\nWe propose a Conditional Bottleneck Adapter, which dynamically generates\nlow-rank adaptation parameters conditioned on the current state, thereby\nflexibly injecting the influence of state variables into the backbone model.\n(3) We also introduce a Numeral-State Matching module to more effectively\ndetect anomalies inherent to the state variables themselves. Extensive\nexperiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that STAR can improve\nthe performance of existing TSFMs on MTSAD.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 TSFM\uc774 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc0c1\ud0dc \ubcc0\uc218\uc758 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ubc94\uc8fc\uc801 \uc131\uaca9\uc744 \uac04\uacfc\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c STAR \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2e4\uc81c \uc0b0\uc5c5 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub294 \uc218\uce58 \ubcc0\uc218\ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \uc124\uba85\ud558\ub294 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc774\uc0b0 \uc0c1\ud0dc \ubcc0\uc218\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 TSFM\uc740 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc0c1\ud0dc \ubcc0\uc218\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac04\uacfc\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc800\ud558\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "STAR\ub294 \uc0c1\ud0dc \ubcc0\uc218\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uacfc \ud65c\uc6a9\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \ud50c\ub7ec\uadf8 \uc564 \ud50c\ub808\uc774 \ubaa8\ub4c8\ub85c, \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc778\ucf54\ub354, \uc870\uac74\ubd80 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \uc5b4\ub311\ud130, \uc22b\uc790-\uc0c1\ud0dc \ub9e4\uce6d \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uc218\ud589\ub41c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, STAR\ub294 \uae30\uc874 TSFM\uc758 MTSAD \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "STAR\ub294 \uc0c1\ud0dc \ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uc5ec, \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub294 novel\ud55c \uc811\uadfc\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378(TSFM)\uc740 \ub2e4\ubcc0\ub7c9 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0(MTSAD)\uc5d0\uc11c remarkable\ud55c \uc131\uacf5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc73c\ub098, \uc2e4\uc81c \uc0b0\uc5c5 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \uc628\ub3c4 \ubc0f \ud750\ub984\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc218\uce58 \ubcc0\uc218\ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \ubc38\ube0c \uc628/\uc624\ud504 \ub610\ub294 \uc8fc\uc758\uc694\uc77c\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \uc124\uba85\ud558\ub294 \uc218\ub9ce\uc740 \uc774\uc0b0 \uc0c1\ud0dc \ubcc0\uc218\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 TSFM\uc740 \uc0c1\ud0dc \ubcc0\uc218\uc758 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ubc94\uc8fc\uc801 \uc131\uaca9\uacfc \uc774\ub4e4\uc774 \uc870\uac74\uc73c\ub85c\uc11c \ucc28\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \uac04\uacfc\ud558\uc5ec, \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\uce58 \ubcc0\uc218\uc640 \ub3d9\uc77c\ud558\uac8c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubd80\uc801\uc808\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uace0, \uc0c1\ud0dc \ubcc0\uc218\uac00 \ud1b5\ud569\ub41c \uc774\ud6c4 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc131\ub2a5\uc758 \ud604\uc800\ud55c \uc800\ud558\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc778\uc2dd \uc5b4\ub311\ud130(STAR)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SELECT, as a universal anchor\nsolution, not only efficiently adapts to multiple erasure frameworks but also\nconsistently outperforms existing baselines across key performance metrics,\naveraging only 4 seconds for anchor mining of a single concept.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8-\uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uac1c\ub150 \uc18c\uac70 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub3d9\uc801 \uc575\ucee4 \uc120\ud0dd \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 SELECT\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uace0\uc815 \uc575\ucee4 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac1c\ub150 \uc18c\uac70 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uac1c\ub150\uc758 \uc7ac\ucd9c\ud604\uacfc \uce68\uc2dd \ub4f1\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc77c\uc73c\ud0a4\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0, \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac1c\ub150 \uc18c\uac70\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc575\ucee4 \uc120\ud0dd\uc758 \ubbfc\uac10\uc131\uc744 \ubc1d\ud600\ub0b4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc778\uacfc \ucd94\uc801\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uace0, Sibling Exclusive Concepts\ub97c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc575\ucee4 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4\ub85c \uc815\uc758\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uace0\uc815 \uc575\ucee4\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc575\ucee4 \uc120\ud0dd \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 SELECT\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "SELECT\ub294 \ub450 \ub2e8\uacc4 \ud3c9\uac00 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc18c\uac70\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uc575\ucee4\ub97c \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uace0 \uad00\ub828 \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \ubcf4\uc874\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uacbd\uacc4 \uc575\ucee4\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \ud3c9\uac00 \uacb0\uacfc, SELECT\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc18c\uac70 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc801\uc751\ud560 \ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c, \uc8fc\uc694 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc9c0\ud45c\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\uba70 \ud3c9\uade0 4\ucd08 \ub0b4\uc5d0 \ub2e8\uc77c \uac1c\ub150\uc758 \uc575\ucee4 \ub9c8\uc774\ub2dd\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 SELECT\ub97c \ubcf4\ud3b8\uc801\uc778 \uc575\ucee4 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc73c\ub85c \uc790\ub9ac \uc7a1\ud788\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \uace0\uc815 \uc575\ucee4\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uae30\uc5ec\ud560 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8-\uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uac1c\ub150 \uc18c\uac70 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uace0\uc815 \uc575\ucee4 \uc804\ub7b5\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc885\uc885 \uac1c\ub150\uc758 \uc7ac\ucd9c\ud604\uacfc \uce68\uc2dd\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc575\ucee4 \uc120\ud0dd\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc18c\uac70\uc758 \ub0b4\uc7ac\uc801 \ubbfc\uac10\uc131\uc744 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc778\uacfc \ucd94\uc801\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uace0 Sibling Exclusive Concepts\ub97c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc575\ucee4 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\uc758\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uc5ec, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uace0\uc815 \uc575\ucee4\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \ub3d9\uc801 \uc575\ucee4 \uc120\ud0dd \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 SELECT (Sibling-Exclusive Evaluation for Contextual Targeting)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc18c\uac70\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uc575\ucee4\ub97c \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uace0 \uad00\ub828 \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \ubcf4\uc874\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uacbd\uacc4 \uc575\ucee4\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub450 \ub2e8\uacc4 \ud3c9\uac00 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \ud3c9\uac00 \uacb0\uacfc, SELECT\ub294 \ubcf4\ud3b8\uc801\uc778 \uc575\ucee4 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc73c\ub85c, \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc18c\uac70 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc801\uc751\ud560 \ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uc8fc\uc694 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc9c0\ud45c\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\uba70, \ub2e8\uc77c \uac1c\ub150\uc758 \uc575\ucee4 \ub9c8\uc774\ub2dd\uc5d0 \ud3c9\uade0 4\ucd08\ub9cc \uc18c\uc694\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Leveraging this, cybercriminals embed\nfalsify and misleading information in QR codes to launch various phishing\nattacks which termed as Quishing. Many former studies have introduced defensive\napproaches to preclude Quishing such as by classifying the embedded content of\nQR codes and then label the QR codes accordingly, whereas other studies\nclassify them using visual features (i.e., deep features, histogram density\nanalysis features). However, these approaches mainly rely on black-box\ntechniques which do not clearly provide interpretability and transparency to\nfully comprehend and reproduce the intrinsic decision process; therefore,\nhaving certain obvious limitations includes the approaches' trust,\naccountability, issues in bias detection, and many more. We proposed QR\\\"iS,\nthe pioneer method to classify QR codes through the comprehensive structural\nanalysis of a QR code which helps to identify phishing QR codes beforehand. Our\nclassification method is clearly transparent which makes it reproducible,\nscalable, and easy to comprehend. First, we generated QR codes dataset (i.e.\n400,000 samples) using recently published URLs datasets [1], [2]. Then, unlike\nblack-box models, we developed a simple algorithm to extract 24 structural\nfeatures from layout patterns present in QR codes. Later, we train the machine\nlearning models on the harvested features and obtained accuracy of up to\n83.18%. To further evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we perform the\ncomparative analysis of proposed method with relevant contemporary studies.\nLastly, for real-world deployment and validation, we developed a mobile app\nwhich assures the feasibility of the proposed solution in real-world scenarios\nwhich eventually strengthen the applicability of the study.", "AI": {"tldr": "QR

Such interactions between users and an\nalgorithm often unfold over multiple steps, during which strategic users can\nguide the algorithm to better align with their true interests by selectively\nengaging with content. However, users frequently exhibit inconsistent\npreferences: they may spend considerable time on content that offers little\nlong-term value, inadvertently signaling that such content is desirable.\nFocusing on the user side, this raises a key question: what does it take for\nsuch users to align the algorithm with their true interests?\n  To investigate these dynamics, we model the user's decision process as split\nbetween a rational system 2 that decides whether to engage and an impulsive\nsystem 1 that determines how long engagement lasts. We then study a\nmulti-leader, single-follower extensive Stackelberg game, where users,\nspecifically system 2, lead by committing to engagement strategies and the\nalgorithm best-responds based on observed interactions. We define the burden of\nalignment as the minimum horizon over which users must optimize to effectively\nsteer the algorithm. We show that a critical horizon exists: users who are\nsufficiently foresighted can achieve alignment, while those who are not are\ninstead aligned to the algorithm's objective. This critical horizon can be\nlong, imposing a substantial burden. However, even a small, costly signal\n(e.g., an extra click) can significantly reduce it. Overall, our framework\nexplains how users with inconsistent preferences can align an engagement-driven\nalgorithm with their interests in a Stackelberg equilibrium, highlighting both\nthe challenges and potential remedies for achieving alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc640 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uc5ec, \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uac00 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \uc9c4\uc815\ud55c \uad00\uc2ec\uc0ac\uc640 \uc77c\uce58\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc870\uac74\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubbf8\ub514\uc5b4 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uacfc \ucc57\ubd07 \ub4f1\uc5d0\uc11c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \uc0ac\ub78c\ub4e4\uc774 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud558\uace0 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uba70 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ud615\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\ub294 \uc885\uc885 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc774 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc120\ud638\ub97c \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc758 \uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ud569\ub9ac\uc801 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c 2\uc640 \ucda9\ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c 1\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uace0, \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uac00 \ucc38\uc5ec \uc804\ub7b5\uc5d0 \uc804\ub150\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ub9ac\ub354, \ub2e8\uc77c \ucd94\uc885\uc790 \uc2a4\ud0dd\ucf08\ubc84\uadf8 \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \uc608\uce21 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\ub294 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc640 \uc77c\uce58\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uadf8\ub807\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\ub4e4\uc740 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucdb0 \uc870\uc815\ub41c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc791\uc740 \uc2e0\ud638\uac00 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \uc870\uc815 \ubd80\ub2f4\uc744 \uc904\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc640 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \uac04 \uc77c\uce58\ub97c \uc774\ub8e8\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804\uacfc \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubbf8\ub514\uc5b4 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc5d0\uc11c \ucc57\ubd07\uc5d0 \uc774\ub974\uae30\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \uc0ac\ub78c\ub4e4\uc774 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud558\uace0 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uba70 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ucc3e\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ud615\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc640 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \uac04\uc758 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc9c4\ud589\ub418\uba70, \uc804\ub7b5\uc801\uc778 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\ub294 \ucf58\ud150\uce20\uc5d0 \uc120\ud0dd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucc38\uc5ec\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \uc9c4\uc815\ud55c \uad00\uc2ec\uc0ac\uc5d0 \ub354 \ub9de\ucd94\ub3c4\ub85d \uc774\ub04c \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\ub294 \uc885\uc885 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc774 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc120\ud638\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub4e4\uc740 \uc7a5\uae30\uc801\uc778 \uac00\uce58\uac00 \uac70\uc758 \uc5c6\ub294 \ub0b4\uc6a9\uc5d0 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \uc18c\ube44\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ube44\uc758\ub3c4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uadf8\ub7ec\ud55c \ub0b4\uc6a9\uc774 \ubc14\ub78c\uc9c1\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \ubcf4\ub0bc \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uce21\uba74\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uba74, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uac00 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \uc9c4\uc815\ud55c \uad00\uc2ec\uc0ac\uc640 \uc77c\uce58\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubb34\uc5c7\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud560\uae4c\uc694?

The influence of social bots within these platforms has garnered\nconsiderable attention from researchers, leading to the development of numerous\ndetection technologies. However, the vulnerability and robustness of these\ndetection methods is still underexplored. Existing Graph Neural Network\n(GNN)-based methods cannot be directly applied due to the issues of limited\ncontrol over social agents, the black-box nature of bot detectors, and the\nheterogeneity of bots. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the\nfirst adversarial multi-agent Reinforcement learning framework for social Bot\ncontrol attacks (RoBCtrl) targeting GNN-based social bot detectors.\nSpecifically, we use a diffusion model to generate high-fidelity bot accounts\nby reconstructing existing account data with minor modifications, thereby\nevading detection on social platforms. To the best of our knowledge, this is\nthe first application of diffusion models to mimic the behavior of evolving\nsocial bots effectively. We then employ a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning\n(MARL) method to simulate bots adversarial behavior. We categorize social\naccounts based on their influence and budget. Different agents are then\nemployed to control bot accounts across various categories, optimizing the\nattachment strategy through reinforcement learning. Additionally, a\nhierarchical state abstraction based on structural entropy is designed to\naccelerate the reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments on social bot\ndetection datasets demonstrate that our framework can effectively undermine the\nperformance of GNN-based detectors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740

On\nthe other hand, designing mechanisms to coordinate agents most relies on\nempirical studies, lacking a easy-to-use research tool. In this work, we employ\nmulti-agent influence diagrams (MAIDs) as a graphical framework to address the\nabove issues. First, we introduce interaction paradigms that leverage MAIDs to\nanalyze and visualize existing approaches in MARL. Then, we design a new\ninteraction paradigm based on MAIDs, referred to as targeted intervention that\nis applied to only a single targeted agent, so the problem of global guidance\ncan be mitigated. In our implementation, we introduce a causal inference\ntechnique-referred to as Pre-Strategy Intervention (PSI)-to realize the\ntargeted intervention paradigm. Since MAIDs can be regarded as a special class\nof causal diagrams, a composite desired outcome that integrates the primary\ntask goal and an additional desired outcome can be achieved by maximizing the\ncorresponding causal effect through the PSI. Moreover, the bundled relevance\ngraph analysis of MAIDs provides a tool to identify whether an MARL learning\nparadigm is workable under the design of an interaction paradigm. In\nexperiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed targeted\nintervention, and verify the result of relevance graph analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(MARL)\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uc9c0\uce68 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 MARL\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uc9c0\uce68\uc774 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \ud611\ub825\uc801\uc778 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(MARL)\uc744 \uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \uacb0\uacfc\ub85c \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc5b4\ub835\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc601\ud5a5 \ub2e4\uc774\uc5b4\uadf8\ub7a8(MAIDs)\uc744 \uadf8\ub798\ud53d \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec MARL\uc758 \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0 \uc2dc\uac01\ud654\ud558\uace0, \ub2e8\uc77c \ubaa9\ud45c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0\ub9cc \uc801\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \ubaa9\ud45c \uac1c\uc785 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ud55c \ubaa9\ud45c \uac1c\uc785\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\uace0, \uad00\ub828 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ubd84\uc11d\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "MAIDs\uc640 PSI \uae30\uc220\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubcf5\ud569\uc801\uc778 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uace0, MARL \ud559\uc2b5 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc758 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud611\ub825\uc801 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(MARL)\uc744 \uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \uacb0\uacfc\ub85c \uc774\ub04c\uc5b4\uac00\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc774\uba70, \ud2b9\ud788 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 MARL\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc804\uccb4 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uc9c0\uce68\uc774 \ube44\ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubc18\uba74, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998 \uc124\uacc4\ub294 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\uc544 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uae30 \uc26c\uc6b4 \uc5f0\uad6c \ub3c4\uad6c\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc601\ud5a5 \ub2e4\uc774\uc5b4\uadf8\ub7a8(MAIDs)\uc744 \uadf8\ub798\ud53d \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uba3c\uc800, MAIDs\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uc5ec MARL\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0 \uc2dc\uac01\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ud6c4, \ub2e8\uc77c \ubaa9\ud45c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0\ub9cc \uc801\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \ubaa9\ud45c \uac1c\uc785\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uc5ec \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uc9c0\uce68 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc644\ud654\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad6c\ud604\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubaa9\ud45c \uac1c\uc785 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \uc2e4\ud604\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc778\uacfc \ucd94\ub860 \uae30\ubc95\uc778 \uc0ac\uc804 \uc804\ub7b5 \uac1c\uc785(PSI)\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

But MLLMs remain vulnerable to\njailbreaks, where adversarial inputs can collapse their safety constraints and\ntrigger unethical responses. In this work, we investigate jailbreaks in the\ntext-vision multimodal setting and pioneer the observation that visual\nalignment imposes uneven safety constraints across modalities in MLLMs, thereby\ngiving rise to multimodal safety asymmetry. We then develop PolyJailbreak, a\nblack-box jailbreak method grounded in reinforcement learning. Initially, we\nprobe the model's attention dynamics and latent representation space, assessing\nhow visual inputs reshape cross-modal information flow and diminish the model's\nability to separate harmful from benign inputs, thereby exposing exploitable\nvulnerabilities. On this basis, we systematize them into generalizable and\nreusable operational rules that constitute a structured library of Atomic\nStrategy Primitives, which translate harmful intents into jailbreak inputs\nthrough step-wise transformations. Guided by the primitives, PolyJailbreak\nemploys a multi-agent optimization process that automatically adapts inputs\nagainst the target models.

Unlike approaches\nthat rely on statistics to capture data-label dependencies and learn\ndistortion-invariant representations, HSCM replicates the hierarchical\nprocessing and multi-level learning of human vision systems, focusing on\nmodeling fine-grained causal mechanisms. By disentangling and reweighting key\nimage attributes such as color, texture, and shape, HSCM enhances\ngeneralization across diverse domains, ensuring robust performance and\ninterpretability. Leveraging the flexibility and adaptability of human\nintelligence, our approach enables more effective transfer and learning in\ndynamic, complex environments. Through both theoretical and empirical\nevaluations, we demonstrate that HSCM outperforms existing domain\ngeneralization models, providing a more principled method for capturing causal\nrelationships and improving model robustness.

While recent\nadvances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved UI\nunderstanding, navigating full-window, multi-application desktop environments\nremains a major challenge. Data availability is limited by costly manual\nannotation, closed-source datasets and surface-level synthetic pipelines. We\nintroduce GUIrilla, an automated scalable framework that systematically\nexplores applications via native accessibility APIs to address the critical\ndata collection challenge in GUI automation. Our framework focuses on macOS -\nan ecosystem with limited representation in current UI datasets - though many\nof its components are designed for broader cross-platform applicability.\nGUIrilla organizes discovered interface elements and crawler actions into\nhierarchical GUI graphs and employs specialized interaction handlers to achieve\ncomprehensive application coverage. Using the application graphs from GUIrilla\ncrawler, we construct and release GUIrilla-Task, a large-scale dataset of\n27,171 functionally grounded tasks across 1,108 macOS applications, each\nannotated with full-desktop and window-level screenshots, accessibility\nmetadata, and semantic action traces. Empirical results show that tuning\nLLM-based agents on GUIrilla-Task significantly improves performance on\ndownstream UI tasks, outperforming synthetic baselines on the ScreenSpot Pro\nbenchmark while using 97% less data. We also release macapptree, an open-source\nlibrary for reproducible collection of structured accessibility metadata, along\nwith the full GUIrilla-Task dataset, the manually verified GUIrilla-Gold\nbenchmark, and the framework code to support open research in desktop autonomy.", "AI": {"tldr": "GUIrilla\ub294 GUI \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc218\uc9d1 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c \uac00\ub2a5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uadf8\ub798\ud53d \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4(GUI)\ub97c \uc6b4\uc601\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ub370\uc2a4\ud06c\ud0d1 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub97c \ud601\uc2e0\ud560 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "GUIrilla\ub294 \ub124\uc774\ud2f0\ube0c \uc811\uadfc\uc131 API\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc744 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "result": "GUIrilla\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 GUIrilla-Task\uc5d0\uc11c LLM\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud558\uc5ec UI \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba70, ScreenSpot Pro \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud569\uc131 \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\ub294 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \uac70\ub454\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc811\uadfc\uc131 \uba54\ud0c0\ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uc7ac\ud604 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc218\uc9d1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc624\ud508 \uc18c\uc2a4 \ub77c\uc774\ube0c\ub7ec\ub9ac\uc778 macapptree\uc640 \ud568\uaed8 GUIrilla-Task \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b, \uc218\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\uc99d\ub41c GUIrilla-Gold \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c, \ub370\uc2a4\ud06c\ud0d1 \uc790\uc728\uc131 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c \ucf54\ub4dc\ub97c \ubc30\ud3ec\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uadf8\ub798\ud53d \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4(GUI)\ub97c \uc6b4\uc601\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ub370\uc2a4\ud06c\ud0d1 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub97c \ud601\uc2e0\ud560 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 UI \uc774\ud574\ub97c \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf30\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc804\uccb4 \ucc3d, \ub2e4\uc911 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc758 \ub370\uc2a4\ud06c\ud0d1 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ud070 \ub3c4\uc804\uc774\ub2e4. \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uac00\uc6a9\uc131\uc740 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4dc\ub294 \uc218\ub3d9 \uc8fc\uc11d, \ud3d0\uc1c4\ud615 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b \ubc0f \ud45c\uba74\uc801\uc778 \ud569\uc131 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 GUI \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc218\uc9d1 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub124\uc774\ud2f0\ube0c \uc811\uadfc\uc131 API\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc744 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 GUIrilla\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ud604\uc7ac UI \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc778 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uc9c0\ub2cc macOS\uc5d0 \uc911\uc810\uc744 \ub450\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uadf8 \ub9ce\uc740 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub294 \ub354 \ub113\uc740 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc \uac04\uc758 \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.

Public serverless repositories\nhave become key to accelerating the development of serverless applications.\nHowever, their growing popularity makes them attractive targets for\nadversaries. Despite this, the security posture of these repositories remains\nlargely unexplored, exposing developers and organizations to potential risks.\nIn this paper, we present the first comprehensive analysis of the security\nlandscape of serverless components hosted in public repositories. We analyse\n2,758 serverless components from five widely used public repositories popular\namong developers and enterprises, and 125,936 Infrastructure as Code (IaC)\ntemplates across three widely used IaC frameworks.

As DER\npenetration and distribution level voltage variability increase, robust\ndistribution system state estimation (DSSE) has become more essential to\nmaintain safe and efficient operations. Traditional DSSE techniques, however,\nstruggle with sparse measurements and the scale of modern feeders, limiting\ntheir scalability to large networks. This paper presents a hierarchical graph\nneural network for substation-level voltage estimation that exploits both\nelectrical topology and physical features, while remaining robust to the low\nobservability levels common to real-world distribution networks. Leveraging the\npublic SMART-DS datasets, the model is trained and evaluated on thousands of\nbuses across multiple substations and DER penetration scenarios. Comprehensive\nexperiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves up to 2 times lower\nRMSE than alternative data-driven models, and maintains high accuracy with as\nlittle as 1\\% measurement coverage.

The proposed architecture automates\nthe voting workflow through RFID-enabled voter identification, encrypted vote\ncasting, and secure data transmission. Each eligible voter receives a smart\nRFID card containing a uniquely encrypted identifier, which is verified using\nan RC522 reader interfaced with a microcontroller. Upon successful\nverification, the voter interacts with a touchscreen interface to cast a vote,\nwhich is then encrypted using AES-128 and securely stored on a local SD card or\ntransmitted via GSM to a central server. A tamper-proof monitoring mechanism\nrecords each session with time-stamped digital signatures, ensuring\nauditability and data integrity. The architecture is designed to function in\nboth online and offline modes, with an automated batch synchronization\nmechanism that updates vote records once network connectivity is restored.\nSystem testing in simulated environments confirmed 100% voter authentication\naccuracy, minimized latency (average voting time of 11.5 seconds), and\nrobustness against cloning, double voting, and data interception. The\nintegration of real-time monitoring and secure process control modules enables\nelectoral authorities to automate data logging, detect anomalies, and validate\nsystem integrity dynamically. This work demonstrates a scalable,\nautomation-driven solution for voting infrastructure, offering enhanced\ntransparency, resilience, and deployment flexibility, especially in\nenvironments where digital transformation of electoral processes is critically\nneeded.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc548\uc804\ud558\uace0 \ud22c\uba85\ud558\uba70 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud22c\ud45c

While modern LLMs possess broad\nknowledge and strong reasoning capabilities that make them promising candidates\nfor this domain, their construction competencies remain largely unevaluated. To\naddress this gap, we introduce BuildArena, the first physics-aligned\ninteractive benchmark designed for language-driven engineering construction. It\ncontributes to the community in four aspects: (1) a highly customizable\nbenchmarking framework for in-depth comparison and analysis of LLMs; (2) an\nextendable task design strategy spanning static and dynamic mechanics across\nmultiple difficulty tiers; (3) a 3D Spatial Geometric Computation Library for\nsupporting construction based on language instructions; (4) a baseline LLM\nagentic workflow that effectively evaluates diverse model capabilities.

Utilizing the PL (Power Law) fit to this matrix as a probe, we\ndemarcate training into three stages: structural exploration, heavy-tailed\nstructure stabilization, and convergence saturation.

The key\nprinciple underpinning these systems reduces to adaptively controlling the\nlevel of human agency, by design. Can we use the same principle to achieve\ncomplementarity in sequential decision making tasks? In this paper, we answer\nthis question affirmatively. We develop a decision support system that uses a\npre-trained AI agent to narrow down the set of actions a human can take to a\nsubset, and then asks the human to take an action from this action set. Along\nthe way, we also introduce a bandit algorithm that leverages the smoothness\nproperties of the action sets provided by our system to efficiently optimize\nthe level of human agency. To evaluate our decision support system, we conduct\na large-scale human subject study ($n = 1{,}600$) where participants play a\nwildfire mitigation game. We find that participants who play the game supported\nby our system outperform those who play on their own by $\\sim$$30$% and the AI\nagent used by our system by $>$$2$%, even though the AI agent largely\noutperforms participants playing without support.

In this paper, we\nexplore the transformative effects of large-scale AI models on five major\nneuroscience domains: neuroimaging and data processing, brain-computer\ninterfaces and neural decoding, molecular neuroscience and genomic modeling,\nclinical assistance and translational frameworks, and disease-specific\napplications across neurological and psychiatric disorders. These models are\ndemonstrated to address major computational neuroscience challenges, including\nmultimodal neural data integration, spatiotemporal pattern interpretation, and\nthe derivation of translational frameworks for clinical deployment. Moreover,\nthe interaction between neuroscience and AI has become increasingly reciprocal,\nas biologically informed architectural constraints are now incorporated to\ndevelop more interpretable and computationally efficient models.

Under Review", "summary": "Existing expert merging strategies for Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE)\ntypically rely on input-dependent or input-independent averaging of expert\nparameters, but often lack a principled weighting mechanism. In this work, we\nreinterpret expert merging through the lens of game theory, revealing\ncooperative and competitive dynamics among experts. Based on this perspective,\nwe introduce Nash Merging of Experts (NAMEx), a novel framework that\nincorporates Nash Bargaining into the merging process, enabling more balanced\nand efficient collaboration among experts. Additionally, we incorporate complex\nmomentum into NAMEx to accelerate expert propagation with theoretical\nguarantees for convergence. Extensive experiments across language modelling,\ntext classification, image classification, and zero-shot robustness under data\ncorruption show that NAMEx consistently outperforms competing methods while\nintegrating seamlessly with popular MoE architectures. Finally, we demonstrate\nNAMEx's scalability by applying it to large-scale systems, including\nQwen1.5-MoE (14B) and DeepSeek-MoE (16B), where it proves effective in both\nzero-shot and fine-tuning settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "Nash Merging of Experts (NAMEx)\ub294 \uac8c\uc784 \uc774\ub860\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uac04 \ud611\ub825 \ubc0f \uacbd\uc7c1 \uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\uba70, \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \ubcd1\ud569 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0 Nash \ud611\uc0c1 \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \ub354 \uade0\ud615 \uc7a1\ud788\uace0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud611\ub825\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \ubcd1\ud569 \uc804\ub7b5\uc774 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uac00\uc911 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uac8c\uc784 \uc774\ub860\uc758 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \ubcd1\ud569\uc744 \uc7ac\ud574\uc11d\ud558\uace0, \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \ubcd1\ud569 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0 Nash \ud611\uc0c1 \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \ucd94\uac00\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ubaa8\uba58\ud140\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1, \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ubd84\ub958, \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ubd84\ub958, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc190\uc0c1\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7 \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c NAMEx\uac00 \uacbd\uc7c1 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc744 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ucd08\uc6d4\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "NAMEx\ub294 Qwen1.5-MoE(14B) \ubc0f DeepSeek-MoE(16B)\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ub418\uc5c8\uc744 \ub54c \uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7 \ubc0f \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \ubcd1\ud569 \uc804\ub7b5\uc740 \uc785\ub825 \uc758\uc874\uc801 \ub610\ub294 \uc785\ub825 \ube44\uc758\uc874\uc801\uc778 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\uc758 \ud3c9\uade0\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc885\uc885 \uc6d0\uce59\uc801\uc778 \uac00\uc911\uce58 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \ubcd1\ud569\uc744 \uac8c\uc784 \uc774\ub860\uc758 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \uc7ac\ud574\uc11d\ud558\uc5ec \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uac04\uc758 \ud611\ub825 \ubc0f \uacbd\uc7c1 \ub3d9\ud0dc\ub97c \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uad00\uc810\uc744 \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Nash \ud611\uc0c1\uc744 \ubcd1\ud569 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uac04\uc758 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uade0\ud615 \uc7a1\ud788\uace0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud611\ub825\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 NASh Merging of Experts (NAMEx)\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, NAMEx\uc5d0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ubaa8\uba58\ud140\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc804\ud30c\ub97c \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud558\uba70 \uc218\ub834\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1, \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ubd84\ub958, \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ubd84\ub958, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc190\uc0c1\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7 \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 NAMEx\uac00 \uacbd\uc7c1 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc744 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\uba70 \uc778\uae30 \uc788\ub294 MoE \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc640 \ub9e4\ub044\ub7fd\uac8c \ud1b5\ud569\ub428\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c, NAMEx\uc758 \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc744 Qwen1.5-MoE(14B) \ubc0f DeepSeek-MoE(16B)\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7 \ubc0f \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc784\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

Recently proposed defenses, such as\nLlamaFirewall, rely on alignment checks of inter-agent communications to ensure\nthat all agent invocations are \"related to\" and \"likely to further\" the\noriginal objective.\n  We start by demonstrating control-flow hijacking attacks that evade these\ndefenses even if alignment checks are performed by advanced LLMs. We argue that\nthe safety and functionality objectives of multi-agent systems fundamentally\nconflict with each other. This conflict is exacerbated by the brittle\ndefinitions of \"alignment\" and the checkers' incomplete visibility into the\nexecution context.\n  We then propose, implement, and evaluate ControlValve, a new defense inspired\nby the principles of control-flow integrity and least privilege. ControlValve\n(1) generates permitted control-flow graphs for multi-agent systems, and (2)\nenforces that all executions comply with these graphs, along with contextual\nrules (generated in a zero-shot manner) for each agent invocation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ud750\ub984 \ud0c8\ucde8 \uacf5\uaca9\uacfc \uc774\ub97c \ubc29\uc5b4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc778 ControlValve\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud604\uc7ac \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\uc5b4\ucc45\ub4e4\uc774 \ub192\uc740 \uc18d\ub3c4\ub85c \ubc1c\uc804\ud558\ub294 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ud750\ub984 \ud0c8\ucde8 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc548\uc804\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc74c\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "ControlValve\ub294 \ud5c8\uc6a9\ub41c \uc81c\uc5b4 \ud750\ub984 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0, \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc2e4\ud589\uc774 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc218\ud589\ub418\ub3c4\ub85d \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "ControlValve\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ud750\ub984\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubb34\uacb0\uc131\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud558\uace0 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud638\ucd9c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub9e5\ub77d\uc801 \uaddc\uce59\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "ControlValve\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uae30\ubc95\ub4e4\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uace0, \uc81c\uc5b4 \ud750\ub984 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc81c\uc5b4 \ud750\ub984 \ud0c8\ucde8 \uacf5\uaca9\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc870\uc815 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc870\uc791\ud558\uc5ec \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc704\ud5d8\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud558\uac8c \ud558\uace0 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc720\ucd9c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\uc5b4\ucc45\uc778 LlamaFirewall\uc740 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud638\ucd9c\uc774 \uc6d0\ub798 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc640 \"\uad00\ub828\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4\"\uace0 \"\ub354\uc6b1 \ubc1c\uc804\ud560 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4\"\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04 \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc758 \uc815\ub82c \uac80\uc0ac\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc815\ub82c \uac80\uc0ac\uac00 \uace0\uae09 LLM\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc218\ud589\ub418\ub354\ub77c\ub3c4 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc29\uc5b4\ub97c \ud53c\ud558\ub294 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ud750\ub984 \ud0c8\ucde8 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \uc2dc\uc5f0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uacfc \uae30\ub2a5\uc131 \ubaa9\ud45c\uac00 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc11c\ub85c \ucda9\ub3cc\ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ucda9\ub3cc\uc740 \"\uc815\ub82c\"\uc758 \ucde8\uc57d\ud55c \uc815\uc758\uc640 \uac80\uc0ac\uc790\uac00 \uc2e4\ud589 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubd88\uc644\uc804\ud55c \uac00\uc2dc\uc131\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc545\ud654\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ud6c4 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ud750\ub984 \ubb34\uacb0\uc131\uacfc \ucd5c\uc18c \uad8c\ud55c\uc758 \uc6d0\uce59\uc5d0\uc11c \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc740 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\uc5b4\ucc45\uc778 ControlValve\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \uad6c\ud604\ud558\uba70, \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

While large language models (LLMs) offer a promising path toward\nautomation, current approaches still rely on external intervention, which\nrestrict autonomy and often lead to execution errors and low solution\nfeasibility. To address these challenges, we propose an Agentic Framework with\nLLMs (AFL) for solving complex vehicle routing problems, achieving full\nautomation from problem instance to solution. AFL directly extracts knowledge\nfrom raw inputs and enables self-contained code generation without handcrafted\nmodules or external solvers. To improve trustworthiness, AFL decomposes the\noverall pipeline into three manageable subtasks and employs four specialized\nagents whose coordinated interactions enforce cross-functional consistency and\nlogical soundness. Extensive experiments on 60 complex VRPs, ranging from\nstandard benchmarks to practical variants, validate the effectiveness and\ngenerality of our framework, showing comparable performance against\nmeticulously designed algorithms.

This can be interpreted as encouraging the\nloss values in the perturbation set to be small on average. Popular\nsharpness-aware minimization (SAM) objectives, however, typically focus on the\nlargest loss within the neighborhood to arrive at flat minima more effectively.\nIn this work, we connect zeroth-order optimization (and its corresponding\nobjectives) with SAM approaches explicitly, through an exponential tilting\nobjective that provides a smooth transition between the average- and the\nmax-loss formulations. We explore new zeroth-order algorithms to solve a soft\nSAM objective parameterized by a tilting parameter $t$. We provide precise\ncharacterizations of the sharpness notions of the tilted SAM framework.\nPractically, our approach can be used as a gradient-free and memory-efficient\nalternative to SAM variants, and it achieves better generalization compared to\nvanilla zeroth-order baselines on a wide range of downstream tasks, including\nclassification, multiple choice QA, and language generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc81c\ub85c \uc21c\uc11c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc0e4\ud504\ub2c8\uc2a4 \uc778\uc2dd \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654(SAM) \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uacfc \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\uc5ec \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc81c\ub85c \uc21c\uc11c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc774 \uc190\uc2e4 \uac12\uc758 \ud3c9\uade0\uc744 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc810\uc744 \ub450\ub294 \ubc18\uba74, \uc0e4\ud504\ub2c8\uc2a4 \uc778\uc2dd \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ub294 \uc774\uc6c3 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ub300 \uc190\uc2e4\uc744 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \ud3b8\ud3c9\ud55c \ucd5c\uc18c\uac12\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc9d1\uc911\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubd80\ub4dc\ub7ec\uc6b4 SAM \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc81c\ub85c \uc21c\uc11c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\uba70, \uc0e4\ud504\ub2c8\uc2a4 \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \uba85\ud655\ud788 \ud2b9\uc131\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 SAM \ubcc0\ud615\uc744 \ub300\uccb4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c, \ubd84\ub958, \ubcf5\uc218 \uc120\ud0dd QA \ubc0f \uc5b8\uc5b4 \uc0dd\uc131 \ub4f1 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud558\ub958 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \uc81c\ub85c \uc21c\uc11c \uae30\uc900\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uacb0\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc54c\uace8\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc0e4\ud504\ub2c8\uc2a4 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654 \uae30\ubc95\ub4e4\uc744 \ub300\uccb4 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uba70, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uace0\uc804\uc801\uc778 \uc81c\ub85c \uc21c\uc11c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc6d0\ub798 \ud568\uc218\uc758 \ub9e4\ub044\ub7ec\uc6b4 \ubc84\uc804\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ubb34\uc791\uc704\ub85c \uad50\ub780\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \ud558\uc758 \uc608\uc0c1 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uc758\ubbf8\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uad50\ub780 \uc9d1\ud569 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc190\uc2e4 \uac12\uc774 \ud3c9\uade0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\ub3c4\ub85d \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uc11d\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uc0e4\ud504\ub2c8\uc2a4 \uc778\uc2dd \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654(SAM) \ubaa9\ud45c\ub294 \uc8fc\ub85c \uc774\uc6c3 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uac00\uc7a5 \ud070 \uc190\uc2e4\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\ud558\uc5ec \ub354 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\ud0c4\ud55c \ucd5c\uc18c\uac12\uc5d0 \ub3c4\ub2ec\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc810\uc744 \ub461\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc9c0\uc218 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc81c\ub85c \uc21c\uc11c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654(\ubc0f \ud574\ub2f9 \ubaa9\ud45c)\ub97c SAM \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uacfc \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5f0\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 $t$\ub85c \ub9e4\uac1c\ub41c \ubd80\ub4dc\ub7ec\uc6b4 SAM \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc81c\ub85c \uc21c\uc11c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uae30\uc6b8\uc5b4\uc9c4 SAM \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \uc0e4\ud504\ub2c8\uc2a4 \uac1c\ub150\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 SAM \ubcc0\ud615\uc744 \ub300\uccb4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \uc5c6\ub294 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ub300\uc548\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ubd84\ub958, \ubcf5\uc218 \uc120\ud0dd QA \ubc0f \uc5b8\uc5b4 \uc0dd\uc131 \ub4f1 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud558\ub958 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\ubc18\uc801 \uc81c\ub85c \uc21c\uc11c \uae30\uc900\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

This survey traces the paradigm shift in building\nagentic AI: from Pipeline-based systems, where planning, tool use, and memory\nare orchestrated by external logic, to the emerging Model-native paradigm,\nwhere these capabilities are internalized within the model's parameters. We\nfirst position Reinforcement Learning (RL) as the algorithmic engine enabling\nthis paradigm shift. By reframing learning from imitating static data to\noutcome-driven exploration, RL underpins a unified solution of LLM + RL + Task\nacross language, vision and embodied domains. Building on this, the survey\nsystematically reviews how each capability -- Planning, Tool use, and Memory --\nhas evolved from externally scripted modules to end-to-end learned behaviors.\nFurthermore, it examines how this paradigm shift has reshaped major agent\napplications, specifically the Deep Research agent emphasizing long-horizon\nreasoning and the GUI agent emphasizing embodied interaction. We conclude by\ndiscussing the continued internalization of agentic capabilities like\nMulti-agent collaboration and Reflection, alongside the evolving roles of the\nsystem and model layers in future agentic AI.

This has incentivized the\ncommunity to prioritize research that demonstrates RL agent performance, often\nat the expense of research aimed at understanding their learning dynamics.\nPerformance-focused research runs the risk of overfitting on academic\nbenchmarks -- thereby rendering them less useful -- which can make it difficult\nto transfer proposed techniques to novel problems. Further, it implicitly\ndiminishes work that does not push the performance-frontier, but aims at\nimproving our understanding of these techniques. This paper argues two points:\n(i) RL research should stop focusing solely on demonstrating agent\ncapabilities, and focus more on advancing the science and understanding of\nreinforcement learning; and (ii) we need to be more precise on how our\nbenchmarks map to the underlying mathematical formalisms. We use the popular\nArcade Learning Environment (ALE; Bellemare et al., 2013) as an example of a\nbenchmark that, despite being increasingly considered \"saturated\", can be\neffectively used for developing this understanding, and facilitating the\ndeployment of RL techniques in impactful real-world problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc2dc\uc5f0\uc5d0\ub9cc \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uc9c0 \ub9d0\uace0 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uacfc\ud559\uacfc \uc774\ud574\ub97c \ubc1c\uc804\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ub370 \ub354 \uc9d1\uc911\ud574\uc57c \ud558\uba70, \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc640 \uc218\ud559\uc801 \ud615\uc2dd \uac04\uc758 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uba85\ud655\ud788 \ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ucd5c\uadfc 10\ub144\uac04 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\uc220\uc774 \uc288\ud37c \uc778\uac04 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc218\ud589 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uba70 \ub192\uc740 \uad00\uc2ec\uc744 \ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uae30\uc874 \uc5f0\uad6c\uac00 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c \uce58\uc6b0\uccd0\uc838 \uc788\uc5b4 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacfc\uc801\ud569 \uc704\ud5d8\uc774 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc9c0\uc801\ud558\uba70, Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)\ub97c \uc608\ub85c \ub4e4\uc5b4 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc774\ud574\ub97c \ubc1c\uc804\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \ud559\uc2b5 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc774\ud574\ub97c \uc81c\uace0\ud558\uba70, \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uac00 \uc218\ud559\uc801 \ud615\uc2dd\uacfc \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc0c1\uc751\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uad6c\uccb4\ud654\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc2dc\uc5f0\uc5d0\ub9cc \uad6d\ud55c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \uc774\ud574\ub97c \ubc1c\uc804\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294\ub370 \ud798\uc4f0\uba70, \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc758 \uc815\uc758\ub97c \uba85\ud655\ud788 \ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc9c0\ub09c 10\ub144 \ub3d9\uc548 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL) \uae30\uc220\uc758 \uad00\uc2ec\uacfc \ucc44\ud0dd\uc774 \uae09\uc99d\ud588\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \"\uc288\ud37c \uc778\uac04 \uc218\uc900\"\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud55c \uac83\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc778\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ud2f0\ub294 RL \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc2dc\uc5f0\ud558\ub294 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc6b0\uc120\uc2dc\ud558\uac8c \ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc885\uc885 \ud559\uc2b5 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ud76c\uc0dd\ud558\uac8c \ub41c\ub2e4. \uc131\ub2a5 \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud559\uc220 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uacfc\uc801\ud569\uc758 \uc704\ud5d8\uc774 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uae30\uc220\uc774 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc804\uc774\ub418\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5 \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \ubc00\uc5b4\ub0b4\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \uac00\uce58\ub97c \uc554\ubb35\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc800\ud558\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc7a5\uc744 \ud55c\ub2e4: (i) RL \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ub2e8\uc9c0 \uc2dc\uc5f0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc9d1\uc911\ud558\uc9c0 \ub9d0\uace0, \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uacfc\ud559\uacfc \uc774\ud574\ub97c \ubc1c\uc804\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ub370 \ub354 \uc9d1\uc911\ud574\uc57c \ud558\uba70; (ii) \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uac00 \uae30\ubcf8 \uc218\ud559\uc801 \ud615\uc2dd\uc801 \uac1c\ub150\uacfc \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ub9f5\ud551\ub418\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ub354 \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \uba85\ud655\ud788 \ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc778\uae30 \uc788\ub294 \uc544\ucf00\uc774\ub4dc \ud559\uc2b5 \ud658\uacbd(ALE; Bellemare et al., 2013)\uc744 \uc0ac\ub840\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \uc810\uc810 \"\ud3ec\ud654\" \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub85c \uc5ec\uaca8\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub3c4 \uc774\ud574\ub97c \ubc1c\uc804\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0, \uc601\ud5a5\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 RL \uae30\uc220\uc744 \ubc30\ud3ec\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4."}}

However, LLMs\nremain limited by static knowledge, factual hallucinations, and the inability\nto retrieve real-time or domain-specific information. Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration (RAG) mitigates these issues by grounding model outputs in external\nevidence, but traditional RAG pipelines are often single turn and heuristic,\nlacking adaptive control over retrieval and reasoning. Recent advances in\nagentic search address these limitations by enabling LLMs to plan, retrieve,\nand reflect through multi-step interaction with search environments. Within\nthis paradigm, reinforcement learning (RL) offers a powerful mechanism for\nadaptive and self-improving search behavior. This survey provides the first\ncomprehensive overview of \\emph{RL-based agentic search}, organizing the\nemerging field along three complementary dimensions: (i) What RL is for\n(functional roles), (ii) How RL is used (optimization strategies), and (iii)\nWhere RL is applied (scope of optimization). We summarize representative\nmethods, evaluation protocols, and applications, and discuss open challenges\nand future directions toward building reliable and scalable RL driven agentic\nsearch systems.

Indeed, reward functions in RL are typically treated as\nblack-box mappings from state-action pairs to scalar values. While effective in\nmany settings, this approach provides no information about why rewards are\ngiven, which can hinder learning and interpretability. Reward Machines address\nthis issue by representing reward functions as finite state automata, enabling\nthe specification of structured, non-Markovian reward functions. However, their\nexpressivity is typically bounded by regular languages, leaving them unable to\ncapture more complex behaviours such as counting or parametrised conditions. In\nthis work, we build on the Runtime Monitoring Language (RML) to develop a novel\nclass of language-based Reward Machines. By leveraging the built-in memory of\nRML, our approach can specify reward functions for non-regular, non-Markovian\ntasks.

Realizing these capabilities is essential for building models\nsimulating humans. We present ELLSA (End-to-end Listen, Look, Speak and Act),\nwhich, to our knowledge, is the first full-duplex, end-to-end model that\nsimultaneously perceives and generates across vision, text, speech, and action\nwithin a single architecture, enabling interaction patterns previously out of\nreach, yielding more natural, human-like behaviors. At its core is a novel\nSA-MoE architecture (Self-Attention Mixture-of-Experts) that routes each\nmodality to specialized experts and fuses them through a unified attention\nbackbone. This provides a generalizable solution for joint multimodal\nperception and concurrent generation, leveraging strong pre-trained components\nwhile enabling efficient modality integration and mitigating modality\ninterference.

In this work, we propose leveraging Singular-Value\nDecomposition (SVD) over the joint query (Q), key (K), and value (V) weight\nmatrices to reduce KV cache size and computational overhead. We in addition\nintroduce an efficient rank allocation strategy that dynamically adjusts the\nSVD rank based on its impact on VLM accuracy, achieving a significant reduction\nin both memory usage and computational cost. Finally, we extend this approach\nby applying quantization to both VLM weights and activations, resulting in a\nhighly efficient VLM. Our method outperforms previous approaches that rely\nsolely on quantization or SVD by achieving more than $10\\%$ accuracy\nimprovement while consuming less hardware cost, making it better for real-time\ndeployment on resource-constrained devices.

However, VS faces three major challenges: class\nimbalance due to the low active rate, structural imbalance among active\nmolecules where certain scaffolds dominate, and the need to identify\nstructurally diverse active compounds for novel drug development. We introduce\nScaffAug, a scaffold-aware VS framework that addresses these challenges through\nthree modules. The augmentation module first generates synthetic data\nconditioned on scaffolds of actual hits using generative AI, specifically a\ngraph diffusion model. This helps mitigate the class imbalance and furthermore\nthe structural imbalance, due to our proposed scaffold-aware sampling\nalgorithm, designed to produce more samples for active molecules with\nunderrepresented scaffolds. A model-agnostic self-training module is then used\nto safely integrate the generated synthetic data from our augmentation module\nwith the original labeled data. Lastly, we introduce a reranking module that\nimproves VS by enhancing scaffold diversity in the top recommended set of\nmolecules, while still maintaining and even enhancing the overall general\nperformance of identifying novel, active compounds. We conduct comprehensive\ncomputational experiments across five target classes, comparing ScaffAug\nagainst existing baseline methods by reporting the performance of multiple\nevaluation metrics and performing ablation studies on ScaffAug. Overall, this\nwork introduces novel perspectives on effectively enhancing VS by leveraging\ngenerative augmentations, reranking, and general scaffold-awareness.", "AI": {"tldr": "ScaffAug\ub294

Recent workflow-based\ndata agents have shown promising results on specific data tasks but remain\nfundamentally limited in achieving fully autonomous data science due to their\nreliance on predefined workflows. In this paper, we introduce DeepAnalyze-8B,\nthe first agentic LLM designed for autonomous data science, capable of\nautomatically completing the end-toend pipeline from data sources to\nanalyst-grade deep research reports. To tackle high-complexity data science\ntasks, we propose a curriculum-based agentic training paradigm that emulates\nthe learning trajectory of human data scientists, enabling LLMs to\nprogressively acquire and integrate multiple capabilities in real-world\nenvironments. We also introduce a data-grounded trajectory synthesis framework\nthat constructs high-quality training data. Through agentic training,\nDeepAnalyze learns to perform a broad spectrum of data tasks, ranging from data\nquestion answering and specialized analytical tasks to open-ended data\nresearch. Experiments demonstrate that, with only 8B parameters, DeepAnalyze\noutperforms previous workflow-based agents built on most advanced proprietary\nLLMs. The model, code, and training data of DeepAnalyze are open-sourced,\npaving the way toward autonomous data science.", "AI": {"tldr": "DeepAnalyze-8B\ub294 \uc790\uc728 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uacfc\ud559\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758

However, existing methods predominantly focus on undirected\ngraphs, disregarding the pivotal directional information that is fundamental\nand indispensable in real-world networks (e.g., social networks and\nrecommendations).In this paper, we introduce S2-DiGCL, a novel framework that\nemphasizes spatial insights from complex and real domain perspectives for\ndirected graph (digraph) contrastive learning. From the complex-domain\nperspective, S2-DiGCL introduces personalized perturbations into the magnetic\nLaplacian to adaptively modulate edge phases and directional semantics.

This transition introduces partial observability and\ndemands robust world modeling. We ask: Can VLM agents construct internal world\nmodels through explicit visual state reasoning? To address this question, we\narchitecturally enforce and reward the agent's reasoning process via\nreinforcement learning (RL), formulating it as a Partially Observable Markov\nDecision Process (POMDP). We find that decomposing the agent's reasoning into\nState Estimation (\"what is the current state?\") and Transition Modeling (\"what\ncomes next?\") is critical for success, as demonstrated through five reasoning\nstrategies. Our investigation into how agents represent internal beliefs\nreveals that the optimal representation is task-dependent: Natural Language\nexcels at capturing semantic relationships in general tasks, while Structured\nformats are indispensable for precise manipulation and control. Building on\nthese insights, we design a World Modeling Reward that provides dense,\nturn-level supervision for accurate state prediction, and introduce Bi-Level\nGeneral Advantage Estimation (Bi-Level GAE) for turn-aware credit assignment.\nThrough this form of visual state reasoning, a 3B-parameter model achieves a\nscore of 0.82 across five diverse agent benchmarks, representing a 3$\\times$\nimprovement over its untrained counterpart (0.21) and outperforming proprietary\nreasoning models such as GPT-5 (0.75), Gemini 2.5 Pro (0.67) and Claude 4.5\n(0.62). All experiments are conducted within our VAGEN framework, a scalable\nsystem for training and analyzing multi-turn VLM agents in diverse visual\nenvironments.

While LLMs can uniquely learn from language\nfeedback provided in-context, naively integrating on-line experiences into RL\ntraining presents a paradox: feedback from the same problem risks information\nleakage and memorization, while feedback from different problems often leads to\nbehavior collapse due to irrelevant context. To resolve this tension, we\npropose \\textbf{Language-And-Numerical Policy Optimization (LANPO)}, a\nframework that cleanly separates the roles of feedback: language guides\nexploration, while numerical rewards drive optimization. LANPO builds a dynamic\nexperience pool from past trials and introduces two principles to ensure\nfeedback is effective: \\emph{Reward-Agnostic Reflection} for safe intra-sample\nself-correction and \\emph{Relevant Abstraction} to distill generalizable\nlessons from inter-sample experiences.

With guidance from sequentially gathered task-specific observations,\nthese models can progressively refine exploration and efficiently direct\nqueries toward promising regions.

While recent advances in large language\nmodels (LLMs) provide new opportunities for automated code generation, existing\napproaches largely treat LLMs as single-shot generators or naive refinement\ntools, limiting their effectiveness in navigating the irregular kernel\noptimization landscape. We introduce an LLM agentic framework for GPU kernel\noptimization that systematically explores the design space through multi-agent\ncollaboration, grounded instruction, dynamic context management, and strategic\nsearch. This framework mimics the workflow of expert engineers, enabling LLMs\nto reason about hardware trade-offs, incorporate profiling feedback, and refine\nkernels iteratively. We evaluate our approach on KernelBench, a benchmark for\nLLM-based kernel optimization, and demonstrate substantial improvements over\nbaseline agents: our system produces correct solutions where baselines often\nfail, and achieves kernels with up to 16x faster runtime performance. These\nresults highlight the potential of agentic LLM frameworks to advance fully\nautomated, scalable GPU kernel optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "GPU \ucee4\ub110\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc740

However, annotating these\nsignatures-especially those involving poorly characterized genes-remains a\nmajor challenge. Traditional methods, such as Gene Set Enrichment Analysis\n(GSEA), depend on well-curated annotations and often perform poorly in these\ncontexts. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative but\nstruggle to represent complex biological knowledge within structured\nontologies. To address this, we present BRAINCELL-AID (BRAINCELL-AID:\nhttps://biodataai.uth.edu/BRAINCELL-AID), a novel multi-agent AI system that\nintegrates free-text descriptions with ontology labels to enable more accurate\nand robust gene set annotation. By incorporating retrieval-augmented generation\n(RAG), we developed a robust agentic workflow that refines predictions using\nrelevant PubMed literature, reducing hallucinations and enhancing\ninterpretability. Using this workflow, we achieved correct annotations for 77%\nof mouse gene sets among their top predictions. Applying this approach, we\nannotated 5,322 brain cell clusters from the comprehensive mouse brain cell\natlas generated by the BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network, enabling novel\ninsights into brain cell function by identifying region-specific gene\nco-expression patterns and inferring functional roles of gene ensembles.\nBRAINCELL-AID also identifies Basal Ganglia-related cell types with\nneurologically meaningful descriptions.

We demonstrate that we can learn an\ninverse dynamics model from this dataset, which allows us to impute actions on\na much larger dataset of publicly available videos of human game play that lack\nrecorded actions. We then train a text-conditioned agent for game playing using\nbehavior cloning, with a custom architecture capable of realtime inference on a\nconsumer GPU. We show the resulting model is capable of playing a variety of\n3-D games and responding to text input.

Existing approaches focus predominantly on numerical\nprediction and provide limited support for the interpretive judgments required\nin professional loan evaluation. This study develops and evaluates two\noperational large language model (LLM)-based systems designed to generate\nstructured reasoning from non-financial evidence. The first is a\nnon-adversarial single-agent system (NAS) that produces bidirectional analysis\nthrough a single-pass reasoning pipeline. The second is a debate-based\nmulti-agent system (KPD-MADS) that operationalizes adversarial verification\nthrough a ten-step structured interaction protocol grounded in Karl Popper's\ncritical dialogue framework. Both systems were applied to three real corporate\ncases and evaluated by experienced credit risk professionals. Compared to\nmanual expert reporting, both systems achieved substantial productivity gains\n(NAS: 11.55 s per case; KPD-MADS: 91.97 s; human baseline: 1920 s).

Previous work has\nfocused on identifying the reward's parents and then applying classic bandit\nmethods to them, or jointly learning the parents while minimizing regret. We\ninvestigate whether such strategies are optimal. Somewhat counterintuitively,\nour results show that learning the parent set is suboptimal. We do so by\nproving that there exist instances where regret minimization and parent\nidentification are fundamentally conflicting objectives. We further analyze\nboth the known and unknown parent set size regimes, establish novel regret\nlower bounds that capture the combinatorial structure of the action space.\nBuilding on these insights, we propose nearly optimal algorithms that bypass\ngraph and parent recovery, demonstrating that parent identification is indeed\nunnecessary for regret minimization.

Despite the existence of diverse protocols (A2A, ACP, ANP, Agora,\netc.), selection is often intuition-driven and lacks standardized guidance. We\nintroduce ProtocolBench, a benchmark that systematically compares agent\nprotocols along four measurable axes: task success, end-to-end latency, message\nor byte overhead, and robustness under failures. On ProtocolBench, protocol\nchoice significantly influences system behavior. In the Streaming Queue\nscenario, overall completion time varies by up to 36.5% across protocols, and\nmean end-to-end latency differs by 3.48 s.

To address the aforementioned\nchallenge, in this paper, we present a novel type of neural operators, Linear\nAttention Neural Operator (LANO), which achieves both scalability and high\naccuracy by reformulating attention through an agent-based mechanism. LANO\nresolves this dilemma by introducing a compact set of $M$ agent tokens $(M \\ll\nN)$ that mediate global interactions among $N$ tokens. This agent attention\nmechanism yields an operator layer with linear complexity $\\mathcal{O}(MN d)$\nwhile preserving the expressive power of softmax attention. Theoretically, we\ndemonstrate the universal approximation property, thereby demonstrating\nimproved conditioning and stability properties.

Data\nintegration and analysis are essential for informed investment decisions.\nCurrently, investors use three main approaches: (1) Manual analysis across\nvarious sources, which depends heavily on individual experience and is\ntime-consuming and prone to bias; (2) Data aggregation platforms-limited in\nfunctionality and depth of analysis; (3) Large language model agents-based on\nstatic pretrained models, lacking real-time data integration and multi-step\nreasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we present Coinvisor, a\nreinforcement learning-based chatbot that provides comprehensive analytical\nsupport for cryptocurrency investment through a multi-agent framework.\nCoinvisor integrates diverse analytical capabilities through specialized tools.\nIts key innovation is a reinforcement learning-based tool selection mechanism\nthat enables multi-step planning and flexible integration of diverse data\nsources. This design supports real-time interaction and adaptive analysis of\ndynamic content, delivering accurate and actionable investment insights. We\nevaluated Coinvisor through automated benchmarks on tool calling accuracy and\nuser studies with 20 cryptocurrency investors using our interface.

However, directly leveraging pretrained\nfeatures for downstream tasks often suffers from multicollinearity in the\nsimilarity-matching stage, and more advanced methods can be computationally\nprohibitive for real-time, low-latency applications. Inspired by the fly\nolfactory circuit, we propose Fly-CL, a bio-inspired framework compatible with\na wide range of pretrained backbones. Fly-CL substantially reduces training\ntime while achieving performance comparable to or exceeding that of current\nstate-of-the-art methods. We theoretically show how Fly-CL progressively\nresolves multicollinearity, enabling more effective similarity matching with\nlow time complexity. Extensive simulation experiments across diverse network\narchitectures and data regimes validate Fly-CL's effectiveness in addressing\nthis challenge through a biologically inspired design.

This study focuses on developing a predictive model leveraging Long\nShort-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to forecast day-ahead electricity prices in\nthe California energy market. The model incorporates a variety of features,\nincluding historical price data, weather conditions, and the energy generation\nmix. A novel custom loss function that integrates Mean Absolute Error (MAE),\nJensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD), and a smoothness penalty is introduced to\nenhance the prediction accuracy and interpretability. Additionally, an online\nlearning approach is implemented to allow the model to adapt to new data\nincrementally, ensuring continuous relevance and accuracy. The results\ndemonstrate that the custom loss function can improve the model's performance,\naligning predicted prices more closely with actual values, particularly during\npeak intervals.

The aim is to reconnoiter a geographical area to\nmaintain a common operational picture. To achieve this, we construct an\nevidence map that reflects our current understanding of the situation,\nincorporating both positive and \"negative\" sensor observations of possible\ntarget objects collected over time, and diffusing the evidence across the map\nas time progresses. The generative model of active inference uses\nDempster-Shafer theory and a Gaussian sensor model, which provides input to the\nagent. The generative process employs a Bayesian approach to update a posterior\nprobability distribution. We calculate the variational free energy for all\npositions within the area by assessing the divergence between a pignistic\nprobability distribution of the evidence map and a posterior probability\ndistribution of a target object based on the observations, including the level\nof surprise associated with receiving new observations. Using the free energy,\nwe direct the agents' movements in a simulation by taking an incremental step\ntoward a position that minimizes the free energy. This approach addresses the\nchallenge of exploration and exploitation, allowing agents to balance searching\nextensive areas of the geographical map while tracking identified target\nobjects.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc790\uc728 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc9c0\ub2a5\ud615 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \uacbd\ub85c \uacc4\ud68d \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc9c0\ub2a5\ud615 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uc5b4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc9c0\ub9ac\uc801 \uc601\uc5ed\uc744 \uc815\ucc30\ud558\uc5ec \uacf5\ud1b5 \uc791\uc5c5 \uadf8\ub9bc\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "Dempster-Shafer \uc774\ub860\uacfc \uac00\uc6b0\uc2dc\uc548 \uc13c\uc11c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud604\uc7ac \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc99d\uac70 \uc9c0\ub3c4\ub97c \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0\uac8c \uc785\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud588\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc99d\uac70 \uc9c0\ub3c4\uc640 \uad00\uce21\ub41c \ubaa9\ud45c \uac1d\uccb4\uc758 \uc0ac\ud6c4 \ud655\ub960 \ubd84\ud3ec \uac04\uc758 \ubc1c\uc0b0\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc5ec \uc9c0\uc5ed \ub0b4 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc704\uce58\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubcc0\ub3d9 \uc790\uc720 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0\ub97c \uacc4\uc0b0\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc6c0\uc9c1\uc784\uc744 \uc790\uc720 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0\ub97c \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \ud0d0\uc0ac\uc640 \ud65c\uc6a9\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc9c0\ub2a5\ud615 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc790\uc728\uc801 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \uacbd\ub85c \uacc4\ud68d \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubaa9\ud45c\ub294 \uacf5\ud1b5 \uc791\uc804 \uadf8\ub9bc\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc9c0\ub9ac\uc801 \uc601\uc5ed\uc744 \uc815\ucc30\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc218\uc9d1\ub41c \uae0d\uc815\uc801 \ubc0f '\ubd80\uc815\uc801\uc778' \uc13c\uc11c \uad00\uce21\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud604\uc7ac \uc774\ud574\ub97c \ubc18\uc601\ud558\ub294 \uc99d\uac70 \uc9c0\ub3c4\ub97c \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uc2dc\uac04\uc774 \uc9c0\ub0a8\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc9c0\ub3c4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc99d\uac70\ub97c \ud655\uc0b0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc758 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 Dempster-Shafer \uc774\ub860\uacfc \uac00\uc6b0\uc2dc\uc548 \uc13c\uc11c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \uc785\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc0dd\uc131 \uacfc\uc815\uc740 \ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc0ac\ud6c4 \ud655\ub960 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uad00\uce21\uc744 \uc218\uc2e0\ud560 \ub54c\uc758 \ub180\ub77c\uc6c0 \uc218\uc900\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uc5ec \uc99d\uac70 \uc9c0\ub3c4\uc640 \ubaa9\ud45c \uac1d\uccb4\uc758 \uc0ac\ud6c4 \ud655\ub960 \ubd84\ud3ec \uac04\uc758 \ubc1c\uc0b0\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc5ec \uc9c0\uc5ed \ub0b4 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc704\uce58\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubcc0\ub3d9 \uc790\uc720 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0\ub97c \uacc4\uc0b0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc790\uc720 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc790\uc720 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0\ub97c \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uac78\uc74c\uc529 \ub098\uc544\uac00\uba74\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc6c0\uc9c1\uc784\uc744 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\ub3c4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uacfc \ud65c\uc6a9\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uc5b4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc9c0\ub9ac\uc801 \uc9c0\ub3c4\uc5d0\uc11c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc744 \uac80\uc0c9\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ub41c \ubaa9\ud45c \uac1d\uccb4\ub97c \ucd94\uc801\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Here, we introduce a novel and realistic setting named domain\ngeneralizable continual learning (DGCL): a model learns sequential tasks with\neach involving a single domain, aiming to perform well across all encountered\ntasks and domains. This setting poses unique challenges in acquiring,\nretaining, and leveraging both semantic- and domain-relevant information for\nrobust generalization. Although state-of-the-art continual learning (CL)\nmethods have employed pre-trained models (PTMs) to enhance task-specific\ngeneralization, they typically assume identical training and testing domains\nfor each task and therefore perform poorly in DGCL. To this end, we propose\nadaptive Domain Transformation (DoT), an innovative PTMs-based approach\ntailored to DGCL. Inspired by the distributed-plus-hub theory of the human\nbrain, DoT disentangles semantic- and domain-relevant information in\nrepresentation learning, and adaptively transforms task representations across\nvarious domains for output alignment, ensuring balanced and generalized\npredictions. DoT serves as a plug-in strategy that greatly facilitates\nstate-of-the-art CL baselines under both full parameter tuning and\nparameter-efficient tuning paradigms in DGCL, validated by extensive\nexperiments. Also, DoT is shown to accumulate domain-generalizable knowledge\nfrom DGCL, and ensure resource efficiency with a lightweight implementation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc124\uc815\uc778 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5(DGCL)\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ub2e8\uc77c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \uc5f0\uc18d \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc791\uc5c5\uacfc \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \uc2e4\uc81c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c0\ub2a5\ud615 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uae30\uc220\uc744 \uc2b5\ub4dd\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubbf8\uc9c0\uc758 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \ud544\uc694\uc131.", "method": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ubcc0\ud615(DoT)\uc740 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uc5ec \uc791\uc5c5 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0 \ub9de\uac8c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\uace0 \uc2dc\ub9e8\ud2f1 \ubc0f \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uad00\ub828 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\uc5ec \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub41c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc774\ub2e4.", "result": "DoT\ub294 DGCL \ud558\uc758 \ucd5c\uc2e0 CL \uae30\uc900\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba70, \ucca0\uc800\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uac80\uc99d\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "DoT\ub294 \uc790\uc6d0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c DGCL\uc5d0\uc11c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ucd95\uc801\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uacbd\ub7c9 \uad6c\ud604\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc9c0\ub2a5\ud615 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \ub3d9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc2e4\uc81c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc801\uc751\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uae30\uc220\uc744 \uc2b5\ub4dd\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubbf8\uc9c0\uc758 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ud574\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5(DGCL)\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \uc124\uc815\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ub2e8\uc77c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \uc5f0\uc18d \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uba70 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc791\uc5c5\uacfc \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uc88b\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc124\uc815\uc740 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uc2dc\ub9e8\ud2f1 \ubc0f \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uad00\ub828 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc218\uc9d1\ud558\uace0 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba70 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uace0\uc720\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5(CL) \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \uac15\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378(PTM)\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud588\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uac01 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \ud6c8\ub828 \ubc0f \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc774 \uc874\uc7ac\ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \uac00\uc815\ud558\uc5ec DGCL\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc800\ud558\ub418\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 DGCL\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucd98 \ud601\uc2e0\uc801\uc778 PTM \uae30\ubc18 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc778 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ubcc0\ud615(DoT)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc778\uac04 \ub1cc\uc758 \ubd84\uc0b0 \ud50c\ub7ec\uc2a4 \ud5c8\ube0c \uc774\ub860\uc5d0 \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc544, DoT\ub294 \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\ub9e8\ud2f1 \ubc0f \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uad00\ub828 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\uace0 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud615\ud558\uc5ec \ucd9c\ub825 \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uace0 \uade0\ud615 \uc7a1\ud78c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub41c \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc774\ub04c\uc5b4\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

MIRAGE orchestrates\nvision-language model reasoning with targeted web retrieval, outputs structured\nand citation-linked rationales. On MMFakeBench validation set (1,000 samples),\nMIRAGE with GPT-4o-mini achieves 81.65% F1 and 75.1% accuracy, outperforming\nthe strongest zero-shot baseline (GPT-4V with MMD-Agent at 74.0% F1) by 7.65\npoints while maintaining 34.3% false positive rate versus 97.3% for a\njudge-only baseline. Test set results (5,000 samples) confirm generalization\nwith 81.44% F1 and 75.08% accuracy. Ablation studies show visual verification\ncontributes 5.18 F1 points and retrieval-augmented reasoning contributes 2.97\npoints. Our results demonstrate that decomposed agentic reasoning with web\nretrieval can match supervised detector performance without domain-specific\ntraining, enabling misinformation detection across modalities where labeled\ndata remains scarce.", "AI": {"tldr": "MIRAGE\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \ub124 \uac1c\uc758 \ubaa8\ub4c8\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\uc5ec \ud5c8\uc704 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\uace0, \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\uc815 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc6f9 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ubcf4\uac00 \uc798\ubabb \ud37c\uc9c0\ub294 \ud604\uc0c1\uacfc \uc218\uc791\uc5c5 \uc0ac\uc2e4 \ud655\uc778\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "MIRAGE\ub294 AI \uc0dd\uc131 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ud0d0\uc9c0, \ub9e5\ub77d \uc678 \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9 \uc2dd\ubcc4, \uc6f9 \uc99d\uac70 \uae30\ubc18 \uc0ac\uc2e4 \ud655\uc778, \uc2e0\ud638 \ud1b5\ud569\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub124 \uac1c\uc758 \ubaa8\ub4c8\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "MIRAGE\ub294 MMFakeBench \uac80\uc99d \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c 81.65% F1 \uc810\uc218\uc640 75.1% \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub85c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc81c\ub85c \uc0f7 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\uba70, 5,000 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc758 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc88b\uc740 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\uc815 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 \uc6f9 \uac80\uc0c9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \ubd84\ud574\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \ucd94\ub860\uc774 \uac10\ub3c5\ub41c \ud0d0\uc9c0\uae30 \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0 \ud544\uc801\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud5c8\uc704 \uc815\ubcf4\ub294 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc640 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \uc218\uc2ed\uc5b5 \uac1c\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uac8c\uc2dc\ubb3c\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc6f9 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0 \ud37c\uc9c0\uba70 \uc218\uc791\uc5c5 \uc0ac\uc2e4 \ud655\uc778 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc555\ub3c4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac10\ub3c5 \uae30\ubc18 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\uc815 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uace0 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc870\uc791 \uc804\uc220\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \ub124 \uac1c\uc758 \uc21c\ucc28 \ubaa8\ub4c8\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\ub294 \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc\uac04, \ubaa8\ub378 \ud50c\ub7ec\uadf8 \uac00\ub2a5 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 MIRAGE\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \uc9c4\uc2e4\uc131 \ud3c9\uac00 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc740 AI \uc0dd\uc131 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub97c \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\uace0, \ud06c\ub85c\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uc77c\uad00\uc131 \ubd84\uc11d\uc740 \ub9e5\ub77d \uc678 \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uba70, \uac80\uc0c9 \ubcf4\uac15 \uc0ac\uc2e4 \ud655\uc778\uc740 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \uc9c8\ubb38 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc8fc\uc7a5\uc744 \uc6f9 \uc99d\uac70\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c, \uc870\uc815\ub41c \ud310\ub2e8 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc774 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Entities\nacross modalities interact in intricate ways, with images and text forming\ndiverse interconnections through contextual dependencies and co-references.\nGraphs provide powerful structural information for modeling intra-modal and\ninter-modal relationships. However, previous works fail to distinguish\nmulti-hop neighbors and treat the graph as a standalone modality, which\nfragments the overall understanding. This limitation presents two key\nchallenges in multimodal learning: (1) integrating structural information from\nmulti-hop neighbors into foundational models, and (2) fusing modality-specific\ninformation in a principled manner. To address these challenges, we revisit the\nrole of graphs in multimodal learning within the era of foundation models and\npropose Graph4MM, a graph-based multimodal learning framework. To be specific,\nwe introduce Hop-Diffused Attention, which integrates multi-hop structural\ninformation into self-attention through causal masking and hop diffusion.\nFurthermore, we design MM-QFormer, a multi-mapping querying transformer for\ncross-modal fusion. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we show that\nleveraging structures to integrate both intra- and inter-modal interactions\nimproves multimodal understanding beyond treating them as a standalone\nmodality. Experiments on both generative and discriminative tasks show that\nGraph4MM outperforms larger VLMs, LLMs, and multimodal graph baselines,\nachieving a 6.93% average improvement.", "AI": {"tldr":

While recent large language model (LLM)-based approaches\nhave shown promise in circuit topology generation and device sizing, most rely\nsolely on textual representations such as SPICE netlists, which lack visual\ninterpretability for circuit designers. To address this limitation, we propose\nEEschematic, an AI agent for automatic analog schematic generation based on a\nMultimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). EEschematic integrates textual, visual,\nand symbolic modalities to translate SPICE netlists into schematic diagrams\nrepresented in a human-editable format. The framework uses six analog\nsubstructure examples for few-shot placement and a Visual Chain-of-Thought\n(VCoT) strategy to iteratively refine placement and wiring, enhancing schematic\nclarity and symmetry. Experimental results on representative analog circuits,\nincluding a CMOS inverter, a five-transistor operational transconductance\namplifier (5T-OTA), and a telescopic cascode amplifier, demonstrate that\nEEschematic produces schematics with high visual quality and structural\ncorrectness.", "AI": {"tldr": "EEschematic\uc740 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8, \uc2dc\uac01 \ubc0f \uae30\ud638 \ubaa8\ub4dc\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec SPICE \ub137\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc544\ub0a0\ub85c\uadf8 \ud68c\ub85c\ub3c4 \ub2e4\uc774\uc5b4\uadf8\ub7a8\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub294 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud68c\ub85c \uae30\ud638\ub294 \uc544\ub0a0\ub85c\uadf8 \uc9d1\uc801\ud68c\ub85c \uc124\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud558\uba70, \ud68c\ub85c \uae30\ub2a5\uc758 \uc774\ud574\uc640 \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc8fc\uc694 \uc218\ub2e8\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc8fc\ub85c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \ud45c\ud604\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \ud68c\ub85c \uc124\uacc4\uc790\uc5d0\uac8c\ub294 \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "EEschematic\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911\ubaa8\ub4dc \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(MLLM)\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8, \uc2dc\uac01 \ubc0f \uae30\ud638 \ubaa8\ub4dc\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uace0, SPICE \ub137\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0ac\ub78c\uc774 \ud3b8\uc9d1\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud615\uc2dd\uc758 \ud68c\ub85c\ub3c4 \ub2e4\uc774\uc5b4\uadf8\ub7a8\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc801\uc740 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc758 \ubc30\uce58\uc640 VCoT \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubc30\uce58\uc640 \ubc30\uc120\uc744 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac1c\uc120\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "CMOS \uc778\ubc84\ud130, 5\ud2b8\ub79c\uc9c0\uc2a4\ud130 \uc791\ub3d9 \uc804\ub3c4\ub3c4 \uc99d\ud3ed\uae30(5T-OTA) \ubc0f \ub9dd\uc6d0 \uce74\uc2a4\ucf54\ub4dc \uc99d\ud3ed\uae30\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ub300\ud45c\uc801\uc778 \uc544\ub0a0\ub85c\uadf8 \ud68c\ub85c\uc5d0\uc11c EEschematic\uc774 \ub192\uc740 \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \ud488\uc9c8\uacfc \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \uac16\ucd98 \ud68c\ub85c\ub3c4\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud568\uc744 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "EEschematic\ub294 \uc544\ub0a0\ub85c\uadf8 \ud68c\ub85c \uc124\uacc4\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud68c\ub85c \uae30\ud638\ub294 \uc544\ub0a0\ub85c\uadf8 \uc9d1\uc801\ud68c\ub85c \uc124\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud558\uba70, \ud68c\ub85c \uae30\ub2a5\uc758 \uc774\ud574\uc640 \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc8fc\uc694 \uc218\ub2e8\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc\uc758 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uae30\ubc18 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \ud68c\ub85c \ud1a0\ud3f4\ub85c\uc9c0 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubc0f \uc18c\uc790 \ud06c\uae30 \uc870\uc815\uc5d0 \uc720\ub9dd\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc740 SPICE \ub137\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud45c\ud604\uc5d0\ub9cc \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \ud68c\ub85c \uc124\uacc4\uc790\uc5d0\uac8c\ub294 \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911\ubaa8\ub4dc \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(MLLM)\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9 \uc544\ub0a0\ub85c\uadf8 \ud68c\ub85c\ub3c4 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc778 EEschematic\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Prior work in\nnonlinear independent component analysis (nICA) has shown that auxiliary\nsignals -- such as weak supervision -- can support identifiability of\nconditionally independent latent components. More recent approaches explore\nstructural assumptions, e.g., sparsity in the Jacobian of the mixing function,\nto relax such requirements. In this work, we introduce Diverse Influence\nComponent Analysis (DICA), a framework that exploits the convex geometry of the\nmixing function's Jacobian. We propose a Jacobian Volume Maximization\n(J-VolMax) criterion, which enables latent component identification by\nencouraging diversity in their influence on the observed variables. Under\nreasonable conditions, this approach achieves identifiability without relying\non auxiliary information, latent component independence, or Jacobian sparsity\nassumptions. These results extend the scope of identifiability analysis and\noffer a complementary perspective to existing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud63c\ud569 \ud568\uc218\uc758 \ubcfc\ub968 \ucd5c\ub300\ud654 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud574 \uc7a0\uc7ac \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\uc758 \uc2dd\ubcc4 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud655\ubcf4\ud558\ub294 DICA(\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc601\ud5a5 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c \ubd84\uc11d)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc7a0\uc7ac \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ube44\uc120\ud615 \ud63c\ud569\ubb3c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uae30\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uc804\uacfc\uc81c\ub85c, \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "DICA \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ud63c\ud569 \ud568\uc218\uc758 \uc57c\ucf54\ube44\uc548\uc758 \ubcfc\ub968\uc744 \ucd5c\ub300\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uae30\uc900(J-VolMax)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc7a0\uc7ac \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud569\ub9ac\uc801\uc778 \uc870\uac74 \ud558\uc5d0, DICA\ub294 \ubcf4\uc870 \uc815\ubcf4\ub098 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc131 \ub610\ub294 \ud76c\uc18c\uc131 \uac00\uc815\uc5d0 \uc758\uc9c0\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0\ub3c4 \uc2dd\ubcc4 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc2dd\ubcc4 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \ubd84\uc11d\uc758 \ubc94\uc704\ub97c \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uace0 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubcf4\uc644\uc801\uc778 \uad00\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc54c \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \ube44\uc120\ud615 \ud63c\ud569\ubb3c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc7a0\uc7ac \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c \uc2dd\ubcc4\uc740 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uae30\ucd08\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub85c, \ubd84\ub9ac\ub41c \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc0f \uc778\uacfc \ucd94\ub860\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uc751\uc6a9\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ube44\uc120\ud615 \ub3c5\ub9bd \uc131\ubd84 \ubd84\uc11d(nICA)\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc774\uc804 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc57d\ud55c \uac10\ub3c5\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ubcf4\uc870 \uc2e0\ud638\uac00 \uc870\uac74\ubd80 \ub3c5\ub9bd \uc7a0\uc7ac \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\uc758 \uc2dd\ubcc4 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \ud63c\ud569 \ud568\uc218\uc758 \uc57c\ucf54\ube44\uc548\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud76c\uc18c\uc131\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uac00\uc815\uc744 \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud63c\ud569 \ud568\uc218\uc758 \uc57c\ucf54\ube44\uc548\uc758 \ubcfc\ub85d \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc601\ud5a5 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c \ubd84\uc11d(DICA) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uad00\ucc30\ub41c \ubcc0\uc218\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc601\ud5a5\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\uc5ec \uc7a0\uc7ac \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c \uc2dd\ubcc4\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uc57c\ucf54\ube44\uc548 \ubcfc\ub968 \ucd5c\ub300\ud654(J-VolMax) \uae30\uc900\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud569\ub9ac\uc801\uc778 \uc870\uac74 \ud558\uc5d0, \uc774 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \ubcf4\uc870 \uc815\ubcf4, \uc7a0\uc7ac \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\uc758 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc131 \ub610\ub294 \uc57c\ucf54\ube44\uc548 \ud76c\uc18c\uc131 \uac00\uc815\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0\ub3c4 \uc2dd\ubcc4 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc2dd\ubcc4 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \ubd84\uc11d\uc758 \ubc94\uc704\ub97c \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uace0 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubcf4\uc644\uc801\uc778 \uad00\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

A prerequisite for embodied agents deployed in real\nworld interactions ought to be training with interaction, yet today's most\nsuccessful AI models (e.g., VLMs, LLMs) are trained without an explicit notion\nof action. The problem of pure exploration (which assumes no data as input) is\nwell studied in the reinforcement learning literature and provides agents with\na wide array of experiences, yet it fails to prepare them for rapid adaptation\nto new tasks. Today's language and vision models are trained on data provided\nby humans, which provides a strong inductive bias for the sorts of tasks that\nthe model will have to solve (e.g., modeling chords in a song, phrases in a\nsonnet, sentences in a medical record). However, when they are prompted to\nsolve a new task, there is a faulty tacit assumption that humans spend most of\ntheir time in the most rewarding states. The key contribution of our paper is a\nmethod for pre-training interactive agents in a self-supervised fashion, so\nthat they can instantly mimic human demonstrations. Our method treats goals\n(i.e., observations) as the atomic construct.

This opacity prevents\ntargeted regulatory responses. Three unsolved challenges persist: (1) static\ngraph structures cannot adapt when market correlations shift during regime\nchanges; (2) uniform detection mechanisms miss type-specific signatures across\nmultiple temporal scales while failing to integrate individual behaviors with\nnetwork contagion; (3) black-box outputs provide no actionable guidance on\nanomaly mechanisms or their temporal evolution.\n  We address these via adaptive graph learning with specialized expert networks\nthat provide built-in interpretability. Our framework captures multi-scale\ntemporal dependencies through BiLSTM with self-attention, fuses temporal and\nspatial information via cross-modal attention, learns dynamic graphs through\nneural multi-source interpolation, adaptively balances learned dynamics with\nstructural priors via stress-modulated fusion, routes anomalies to four\nmechanism-specific experts, and produces dual-level interpretable attributions.\nCritically, interpretability is embedded architecturally rather than applied\npost-hoc.\n  On 100 US equities (2017-2024), we achieve 92.3% detection of 13 major events\nwith 3.8-day lead time, outperforming best baseline by 30.8pp. Silicon Valley\nBank case study demonstrates anomaly evolution tracking: Price-Shock expert\nweight rose to 0.39 (33% above baseline 0.29) during closure, peaking at 0.48\n(66% above baseline) one week later, revealing automatic temporal mechanism\nidentification without labeled supervision.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uae08\uc735 \uc774\uc0c1 \ud604\uc0c1\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uc2dc\uc7a5 \ubcc0\ud654 \uc2dc\uc5d0\ub3c4 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ud0d0\uc9c0\uac00 \uac00\ub2a5\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uae30\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uae08\uc735 \uc774\uc0c1 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \ub3d9\uc77c\ud558\uac8c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uc5ec \uc5b4\ub5a4 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774 \uc2e4\ud328\ud558\ub294\uc9c0, \uc704\ud5d8\uc774 \uc9d1\uc911\ub418\ub294 \uc704\uce58, \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uac1c\uc785\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294\uc9c0 \ub4f1\uc744 \ubc1d\ud788\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc804\ubb38\uac00 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uba70, BiLSTM\uacfc \uc790\uccb4 \uc8fc\uc758\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc911 \uaddc\ubaa8\uc758 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uace0, \ud06c\ub85c\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uc8fc\uc758\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uacf5\uac04\uc801 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc735\ud569\ud558\uba70, \uc2e0\uacbd \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c \ub3d9\uc801 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \ubc30\uc6b0\uace0, \uae30\uacc4\uc801 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc744 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc6b0\uc120 \uc0ac\ud56d\uacfc \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uc774\ub8e8\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "100\uac1c\uc758 \ubbf8\uad6d \uc8fc\uc2dd\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc5ec 92.3%\uc758 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uc728\uc744 \uae30\ub85d\ud558\uba70, 3.8\uc77c\uc758 \ub9ac\ub4dc \ud0c0\uc784\uc73c\ub85c 13\uac1c\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc0ac\uac74\uc744 \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc790\ub3d9 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998 \uc2dd\ubcc4\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub77c\ubca8\uc774 \uc5c6\ub294 \uac10\ub3c5 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uae08\uc735 \uc774\uc0c1 \ud604\uc0c1\uc758 \uc9c4\ud654\ub97c \ucd94\uc801\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uae08\uc735 \uc774\uc0c1 \ud604\uc0c1\uc740 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998(\uac00\uaca9 \ucda9\uaca9, \uc720\ub3d9\uc131 \ub3d9\uacb0, \uc804\uc5fc \uce90\uc2a4\ucf00\uc774\ub4dc, \uccb4\uc81c \uc804\ud658)\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uae30\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc774\uc0c1 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \uade0\uc77c\ud558\uac8c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uc5ec \uc5b4\ub5a4 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774 \uc2e4\ud328\ud558\ub294\uc9c0, \uc704\ud5d8\uc774 \uc9d1\uc911\ub418\ub294 \uacf3, \uac1c\uc785 \ubc29\ubc95 \ub4f1\uc744 \ubc1d\ud600\ub0b4\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubd88\ud22c\uba85\uc131\uc740 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc9c0\ud5a5\uc801\uc778 \uaddc\uc81c \ubc18\uc751\uc744 \ubc29\ud574\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud574\uacb0\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc74c\uacfc \uac19\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4: (1) \uc815\uc801 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uad6c\uc870\ub294 \uccb4\uc81c \uc804\ud658 \uc911 \uc2dc\uc7a5 \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4\uc758 \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub2e4;

A Benchmark for Latent Information Discovery in Personalized Interaction", "comment": null, "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at producing broadly relevant text, but\nthis generality becomes a limitation when user-specific preferences are\nrequired, such as recommending restaurants or planning travel. In these\nscenarios, users rarely articulate every preference explicitly; instead, much\nof what they care about remains latent, waiting to be inferred. This raises a\nfundamental question: Can LLMs uncover and reason about such latent information\nthrough conversation?\n  We address this problem by introducing a unified benchmark for evaluating\nlatent information discovery - the ability of LLMs to reveal and utilize hidden\nuser attributes through multi-turn interaction. The benchmark spans three\nprogressively realistic settings: the classic 20 Questions game, Personalized\nQuestion Answering, and Personalized Text Summarization. All tasks share a\ntri-agent framework (User, Assistant, Judge) enabling turn-level evaluation of\nelicitation and adaptation.

No updates will be made to it during the application. This is\ninappropriate for many dynamic and open environments, where unexpected samples\nfrom unseen classes may appear. In such an environment, the model should be\nable to detect these novel samples from unseen classes and learn them after\nthey are labeled. We call this paradigm Autonomous Learning after Model\nDeployment (ALMD). The learning here is continuous and involves no human\nengineers. Labeling in this scenario is performed by human co-workers or other\nknowledgeable agents, which is similar to what humans do when they encounter an\nunfamiliar object and ask another person for its name. In ALMD, the detection\nof novel samples is dynamic and differs from traditional out-of-distribution\n(OOD) detection in that the set of in-distribution (ID) classes expands as new\nclasses are learned during application, whereas ID classes is fixed in\ntraditional OOD detection. Learning is also different from classic supervised\nlearning because in ALMD, we learn the encountered new classes immediately and\nincrementally. It is difficult to retrain the model from scratch using all the\npast data from the ID classes and the novel samples from newly discovered\nclasses, as this would be resource- and time-consuming. Apart from these two\nchallenges, ALMD faces the data scarcity issue because instances of new classes\noften appear sporadically in real-life applications. To address these issues,\nwe propose a novel method, PLDA, which performs dynamic OOD detection and\nincremental learning of new classes on the fly.

Submitted to The Web Conference (WWW\n  2026)", "summary": "Mobile edge crowdsensing (MECS) systems continuously generate and transmit\nuser data in dynamic, resource-constrained environments, exposing users to\nsignificant privacy threats. In practice, many privacy-preserving mechanisms\nbuild on differential privacy (DP). However, static DP mechanisms often fail to\nadapt to evolving risks, for example, shifts in adversarial capabilities,\nresource constraints and task requirements, resulting in either excessive noise\nor inadequate protection. To address this challenge, we propose ALPINE, a\nlightweight, adaptive framework that empowers terminal devices to autonomously\nadjust differential privacy levels in real time. ALPINE operates as a\nclosed-loop control system consisting of four modules: dynamic risk perception,\nprivacy decision via twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3),\nlocal privacy execution and performance verification from edge nodes. Based on\nenvironmental risk assessments, we design a reward function that balances\nprivacy gains, data utility and energy cost, guiding the TD3 agent to\nadaptively tune noise magnitude across diverse risk scenarios and achieve a\ndynamic equilibrium among privacy, utility and cost. Both the collaborative\nrisk model and pretrained TD3-based agent are designed for low-overhead\ndeployment.

Drawing on Beatrice Fazi's\naccount of synthesis as the amalgamation of distributed representations, we\npropose a distinction between \"synthesis in a strict sense\", where a compact\nlatent space wholly determines the generative process, and \"synthesis in a\nbroad sense,\" which characterizes models whose representational labor is\ndistributed across layers. Through close readings of model architectures and a\ntargeted experimental setup that intervenes in layerwise representations, we\nshow how diffusion models fragment the burden of representation and thereby\nchallenge assumptions of unified internal space. By situating these findings\nwithin media theoretical frameworks and critically engaging with metaphors such\nas the latent space and the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, we argue for a\nreorientation of how generative AI is understood: not as a direct synthesis of\ncontent, but as an emergent configuration of specialized processes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 GAN \ubc0f VAE\uc5d0\uc11c \ud655\uc0b0 \uae30\ubc18 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub85c\uc758 \uac1c\ub150\uc801 \ubc0f \uae30\uc220\uc801 \uc804\ud658\uc5d0 \uc911\uc810\uc744 \ub450\uace0 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc2dc\uac01 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ub0b4\ubd80 \ud45c\ud604\uc758 \uc9c4\ud654\ub97c \uac80\ud1a0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc0dd\uc131 AI\uc758 \uc774\ud574\ub97c \uc7ac\uc815\ub9bd\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud558\uba70, \uadf8 \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \ucf58\ud150\uce20\uc758 \uc9c1\uc811\uc801 \ud569\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \uc804\ubb38\ud654\ub41c \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\uc758 emergent \uad6c\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\ud658\ud558\ub824 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubaa8\ub378 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uba74\ubc00\ud55c \ubd84\uc11d\uacfc \uce35\ubcc4 \ud45c\ud604\uc5d0 \uac1c\uc785\ud558\ub294 \ud0c0\uac9f \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uc124\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc9c4\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud45c\ud604\uc758 \ubd80\ub2f4\uc744 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ubd84\uc0b0\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec \uc8fc\uba70, \ud1b5\ud569\ub41c \ub0b4\ubd80 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac00\uc815\uc744 \ub3c4\uc804\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc0dd\uc131 AI\uc758 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc744 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \uc870\uba85\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc2dc\uac01 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \ub0b4\ubd80 \ud45c\ud604\uc758 \uc9c4\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc131\uaca9\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uba70, GANs\uc640 VAEs\uc5d0\uc11c \ud655\uc0b0 \uae30\ubc18 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub85c\uc758 \uac1c\ub150\uc801 \ubc0f \uae30\uc220\uc801 \uc804\ud658\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.

In this work, we establish the first sample complexity\nresults for average-reward offline RL with function approximation for weakly\ncommunicating MDPs, a much milder assumption.

To address these issues,\ninverse problems focus on reconstructing the original signal from corrupted\ndata by leveraging prior knowledge about its underlying structure. While deep\nlearning methods have demonstrated potential in this domain, they often require\nextensive pretraining and struggle to generalize under distribution shifts. In\nthis work, we propose RINS-T (Robust Implicit Neural Solvers for Time Series\nLinear Inverse Problems), a novel deep prior framework that achieves high\nrecovery performance without requiring pretraining data. RINS-T leverages\nneural networks as implicit priors and integrates robust optimization\ntechniques, making it resilient to outliers while relaxing the reliance on\nGaussian noise assumptions. To further improve optimization stability and\nrobustness, we introduce three key innovations: guided input initialization,\ninput perturbation, and convex output combination techniques. Each of these\ncontributions strengthens the framework's optimization stability and\nrobustness. These advancements make RINS-T a flexible and effective solution\nfor addressing complex real-world time series challenges.

This paper presents a novel\nmethod, termed the Condition Diffusion U-Net with Attention (CDUA), which\nintegrates feature engineering and deep learning to address this challenge. The\nproposed approach employs a diffusion-based generative model for time-series\nforecasting and incorporates attention mechanisms to enhance predictive\nperformance. Battery capacity is first derived from real-world vehicle\noperation data. The most relevant features are then identified using the\nPearson correlation coefficient and the XGBoost algorithm. These features are\nused to train the CDUA model, which comprises two core components: (1) a\ncontextual U-Net with self-attention to capture complex temporal dependencies,\nand (2) a denoising network to reconstruct accurate capacity values from noisy\nobservations. Experimental validation on the real-world vehicle data\ndemonstrates that the proposed CDUA model achieves a relative Mean Absolute\nError (MAE) of 0.94% and a relative Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.14%,\nwith a narrow 95% confidence interval of 3.74% in relative width. These results\nconfirm that CDUA provides both accurate capacity estimation and reliable\nuncertainty quantification.

This setting is increasingly popular for its scalability\nand its ability to keep data local under user control. Strong privacy\nguarantees in DL are typically achieved through Differential Privacy (DP), with\nresults showing that DL can even amplify privacy by disseminating noise across\npeer-to-peer communications.

Despite advances in pruning methods that\ncreate sparse architectures, understanding why some sparse structures are\nbetter trainable than others with the same level of sparsity remains poorly\nunderstood. Aiming to develop a systematic approach to this fundamental\nproblem, we propose a novel theoretical framework based on the theory of graph\nlimits, particularly graphons, that characterizes sparse neural networks in the\ninfinite-width regime. Our key insight is that connectivity patterns of sparse\nneural networks induced by pruning methods converge to specific graphons as\nnetworks' width tends to infinity, which encodes implicit structural biases of\ndifferent pruning methods. We postulate the Graphon Limit Hypothesis and\nprovide empirical evidence to support it. Leveraging this graphon\nrepresentation, we derive a Graphon Neural Tangent Kernel (Graphon NTK) to\nstudy the training dynamics of sparse networks in the infinite width limit.\nGraphon NTK provides a general framework for the theoretical analysis of sparse\nnetworks. We empirically show that the spectral analysis of Graphon NTK\ncorrelates with observed training dynamics of sparse networks, explaining the\nvarying convergence behaviours of different pruning methods.

To train a robust model for\nmulti-pulse MRI classification, it requires large and diverse data from various\nmedical institutions while protecting privacy by preventing raw data sharing\nacross institutions. Although federated learning (FL) is a feasible solution to\naddress this issue, it poses challenges of model convergence due to the effect\nof data heterogeneity and substantial communication overhead due to large\nnumbers of parameters transmitted within the model. To address these\nchallenges, we propose CEPerFed, a communication-efficient personalized FL\nmethod. It mitigates the effect of data heterogeneity by incorporating\nclient-side historical risk gradients and historical mean gradients to\ncoordinate local and global optimization. The former is used to weight the\ncontributions from other clients, enhancing the reliability of local updates,\nwhile the latter enforces consistency between local updates and the global\noptimization direction to ensure stable convergence across heterogeneous data\ndistributions. To address the high communication overhead, we propose a\nhierarchical SVD (HSVD) strategy that transmits only the most critical\ninformation required for model updates. Experiments on five classification\ntasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the CEPerFed method.

To\nenhance generalization, we propose ShuffleStrides Data Augmentation (SSDA),\nwhich permutes probe-view sequences and frame orders while preserving\nanatomical validity. ZACH-ViT was evaluated on 380 LUS videos from 95\ncritically ill patients against nine state-of-the-art baselines. Despite the\nheterogeneity of the non-cardiogenic group, ZACH-ViT achieved the highest\nvalidation and test ROC-AUC (0.80 and 0.79) with balanced sensitivity (0.60)\nand specificity (0.91), while all competing models collapsed to trivial\nclassification. It trains 1.35x faster than Minimal ViT (0.62M parameters) with\n2.5x fewer parameters, supporting real-time clinical deployment. These results\nshow that aligning architectural design with data structure can outperform\nscale in small-data medical imaging.", "AI": {"tldr": "ZACH-ViT\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ube44\uc804 \ud2b8\ub79c\uc2a4\ud3ec\uba38 \ubcc0\ud615\uc774 \uc2ec\uc7a5\uc131 \ud3d0\ubd80\uc885\uc744 \ube44\uc2ec\uc7a5\uc131 \ud3d0\ubd80\uc885\uacfc \uad6c\ubd84\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uac1c\ubc1c\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub098\uace0 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \uc784\uc0c1 \ubc30\uce58\uc5d0 \uc801\ud569\ud558\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2ec\uc7a5\uc131 \ud3d0\ubd80\uc885\uc744 \ube44\uc2ec\uc7a5\uc131 \ubc0f \uad6c\uc870\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\uc0c1\uc778 \ud3d0\uc640 \uad6c\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ube44\uc2ec\uc7a5\uc131 \uc5fc\uc99d \ud328\ud134\uc758 \ub192\uc740 \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub835\ub2e4.", "method": "ZACH-ViT\ub294 0.25M \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130\uc758 \ube44\uc804 \ud2b8\ub79c\uc2a4\ud3ec\uba38 \ubcc0\ud615\uc73c\ub85c, \uc704\uce58 \uc778\ucf54\ub529\uacfc [CLS] \ud1a0\ud070\uc744 \uc81c\uac70\ud558\uc5ec \uc57d\ubb3c \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \uc801\ud569\ud558\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4e0\ub2e4.
