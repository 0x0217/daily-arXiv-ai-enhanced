Without requiring additional nodes or extensive\nradio frequency chains, the FAS effectively enables adaptive antenna port\nselection by exploiting channel spatial correlation to enhance the key\ngeneration rate (KGR) at legitimate nodes. To comprehensively evaluate the\nefficiency of the FAS in PLKG, we propose an FAS-assisted PLKG model that\nintegrates transmit beamforming and sparse port selection under independent and\nidentically distributed and spatially correlated channel models, respectively.\nSpecifically, the PLKG utilizes reciprocal channel probing to derive a\nclosed-form KGR expression based on the mutual information between legitimate\nchannel estimates. Nonconvex optimization problems for these scenarios are\nformulated to maximize the KGR subject to transmit power constraints and sparse\nport activation. We propose an iterative algorithm by capitalizing on\nsuccessive convex approximation and Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to obtain a\nlocally optimal solution. A reweighted $\\ell_1$-norm-based algorithm is applied\nto advocate for the sparse port activation of FAS-assisted PLKG. Furthermore, a\nlow-complexity sliding window-based port selection is proposed to substitute\nreweighted $\\ell_1$-norm method based on Rayleigh-quotient analysis. Simulation\nresults demonstrate that the FAS-PLKG scheme significantly outperforms the\nFA-PLKG scheme in both independent and spatially correlated environments. The\nsliding window-based port selection method introduced in this paper has been\nshown to yield superior KGR, compared to the reweighted $\\ell_1$-norm method.\nIt is shown that the FAS achieves higher KGR with fewer RF chains through\ndynamic sparse port selection."}

Because a scheming AI would deliberately try to hide its\nmisaligned goals and actions, measuring and mitigating scheming requires\ndifferent strategies than are typically used in ML. We propose that assessing\nanti-scheming interventions requires at least (1) testing propensity to scheme\non far out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks, (2) evaluating whether lack of scheming\nis driven by situational awareness, and (3) checking for robustness to\npre-existing misaligned goals. We use a broad category of \"covert actions\" --\nsuch as secretly breaking rules or intentionally underperforming in tests -- as\na proxy for scheming, and design evaluations for covert actions. We then\nstress-test deliberative alignment as a case study for anti-scheming. Across 26\nOOD evaluations (180+ environments), deliberative alignment reduces covert\naction rates (OpenAI o3: 13%->0.4%) but does not fully eliminate them. Our\nmitigation is also able to largely stop agents from pursuing a hidden goal\npreviously trained into the model, but we still find misbehavior after\nadditional red-teaming. We find that models' chain-of-thought (CoT) often\ndemonstrates awareness of being evaluated for alignment, and show causal\nevidence that this awareness decreases covert behavior, while unawareness\nincreases it. Therefore, we cannot exclude that the observed reductions in\ncovert action rates are at least partially driven by situational awareness.\nWhile we rely on human-legible CoT for training, studying situational\nawareness, and demonstrating clear evidence of misalignment, our ability to\nrely on this degrades as models continue to depart from reasoning in standard\nEnglish.
