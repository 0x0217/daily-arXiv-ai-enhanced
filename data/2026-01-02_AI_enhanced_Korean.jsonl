Existing approaches, such as Lagrangian and projection-based methods, often either fail to ensure near-zero safety violations or sacrifice reward performance in the face of hard constraints. We propose Safety-Biased Trust Region Policy Optimisation (SB-TRPO), a new trust-region algorithm for hard-constrained RL. SB-TRPO adaptively biases policy updates towards constraint satisfaction while still seeking reward improvement. Concretely, it performs trust-region updates using a convex combination of the natural policy gradients of cost and reward, ensuring a fixed fraction of optimal cost reduction at each step. We provide a theoretical guarantee of local progress towards safety, with reward improvement when gradients are suitably aligned. Experiments on standard and challenging Safety Gymnasium tasks show that SB-TRPO consistently achieves the best balance of safety and meaningful task completion compared to state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc548\uc804-critical \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc548\uc804 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud788 \uc900\uc218\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud574\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

RL has been widely applied in various quantitative tasks. However, most methods focus on the spot and could not be directly applied to the futures market with high leverage because of 2 challenges. First, high leverage amplifies reward fluctuations, making training stochastic and difficult to converge. Second, prior works lacked self-awareness of capability boundaries, exposing them to the risk of significant loss when encountering new market state (e.g.,a black swan event like COVID-19). To tackle these challenges, we propose the Efficient and Risk-Aware Ensemble Reinforcement Learning for Futures Trading (FineFT), a novel three-stage ensemble RL framework with stable training and proper risk management. In stage I, ensemble Q learners are selectively updated by ensemble TD errors to improve convergence. In stage II, we filter the Q-learners based on their profitabilities and train VAEs on market states to identify the capability boundaries of the learners. In stage III, we choose from the filtered ensemble and a conservative policy, guided by trained VAEs, to maintain profitability and mitigate risk with new market states. Through extensive experiments on crypto futures in a high-frequency trading environment with high fidelity and 5x leverage, we demonstrate that FineFT outperforms 12 SOTA baselines in 6 financial metrics, reducing risk by more than 40% while achieving superior profitability compared to the runner-up. Visualization of the selective update mechanism shows that different agents specialize in distinct market dynamics, and ablation studies certify routing with VAEs reduces maximum drawdown effectively, and selective update improves convergence and performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uace0\ub808\ubc84\ub9ac\uc9c0 \ubc0f \uc720\ub3d9\uc131\uc774 \ub192\uc740

While Federated Learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaborative intrusion detection, existing frameworks remain vulnerable to Byzantine poisoning attacks and lack robust agent authentication. We propose Zero-Trust Agentic Federated Learning (ZTA-FL), a defense in depth framework combining: (1) TPM-based cryptographic attestation achieving less than 0.0000001 false acceptance rate, (2) a novel SHAP-weighted aggregation algorithm providing explainable Byzantine detection under non-IID conditions with theoretical guarantees, and (3) privacy-preserving on-device adversarial training. Comprehensive experiments across three IDS benchmarks (Edge-IIoTset, CIC-IDS2017, UNSW-NB15) demonstrate that ZTA-FL achieves 97.8 percent detection accuracy, 93.2 percent accuracy under 30 percent Byzantine attacks (outperforming FLAME by 3.1 percent, p less than 0.01), and 89.3 percent adversarial robustness while reducing communication overhead by 34 percent.

Previous methods have introduced generative models such as diffusion probabilistic models and Schrodinger bridge models to conditionally generate the missing values from Gaussian noise or directly from linear interpolation results. However, as their prior is not informative to the ground-truth target, their generation process inevitably suffer increased burden and limited imputation accuracy. In this work, we present Bridge-TS, building a data-to-data generation process for generative time series imputation and exploiting the design of prior with two novel designs. Firstly, we propose expert prior, leveraging a pretrained transformer-based module as an expert to fill the missing values with a deterministic estimation, and then taking the results as the prior of ground truth target. Secondly, we explore compositional priors, utilizing several pretrained models to provide different estimation results, and then combining them in the data-to-data generation process to achieve a compositional priors-to-target imputation process. Experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets such as ETT, Exchange, and Weather show that Bridge-TS reaches a new record of imputation accuracy in terms of mean square error and mean absolute error, demonstrating the superiority of improving prior for generative time series imputation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 Bridge-TS\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4 \uacb0\uce21\uac12 \ubcf4\uc644\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uac04 \uc0dd\uc131 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uace0, \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4 \ubcf4\uc644\uc740 \uc804\ub825, \uae08\uc735 \ubc0f \ub0a0\uc528 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \ub4f1 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc751\uc6a9 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uac00 \ub0ae\uace0 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ubd80\ub2f4\uc774 \ud06c\ub2e4\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc548\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "Bridge-TS\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc0ac\uc804 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ubcc0\ud658\uae30 \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc744 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 prior\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uace0, \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc870\ud569 prior\ub97c \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc5ec\ub7ec \uae30\uc900 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c Bridge-TS\ub294 \ud3c9\uade0 \uc81c\uacf1 \uc624\ucc28\uc640 \ud3c9\uade0 \uc808\ub300 \uc624\ucc28 \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uae30\ub85d\uc758 \ubcf4\uc644 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc0ac\uc804 \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc0dd\uc131\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4 \ubcf4\uc644\uc758 \uc6b0\uc218\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4 \ubcf4\uc644, \uc989 \uc2dc\uac04 \uae30\ub85d\uc758 \uacb0\uce21\uac12\uc744 \ucc44\uc6b0\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5\uc740 \uc804\uae30, \uae08\uc735 \ubc0f \ub0a0\uc528 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \ub4f1 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc751\uc6a9 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub41c\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 Gaussian \ub178\uc774\uc988 \ub610\ub294 \uc120\ud615 \ubcf4\uac04 \uacb0\uacfc\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uacb0\uce21\uac12\uc744 \uc870\uac74\ubd80\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud655\uc0b0 \ud655\ub960 \ubaa8\ub378 \ubc0f \uc288\ub8b0\ub529\uac70 \ube0c\ub9bf\uc9c0 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uadf8\ub4e4\uc758 \uc0ac\uc804 \uc815\ubcf4\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \ubaa9\ud45c\uc640 \uad00\ub828\uc774 \uc5c6\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc0dd\uc131 \uacfc\uc815\uc740 \ud544\uc5f0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd80\ub2f4\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \ubcf4\uc644 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uac00 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 Bridge-TS\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc0dd\uc131\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4 \ubcf4\uc644\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uac04 \uc0dd\uc131 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uace0 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc0ac\uc804 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4. \uccab\uc9f8\ub85c, \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ubcc0\ud658\uae30 \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc744 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uacb0\uce21\uac12\uc744 \uacb0\uc815\uc801 \ucd94\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \ucc44\uc6b0\uace0 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc2e4\uc81c \ubaa9\ud45c\uc758 \uc0ac\uc804 \uc815\ubcf4\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc0ac\uc804\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub458\uc9f8\ub85c, \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ucd94\uc815 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uac04 \uc0dd\uc131 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc870\ud569 \uc0ac\uc804-\ub300\uc0c1 \ubcf4\uc644 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc870\ud569 prior\ub97c \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud55c\ub2e4.

While recent work has demonstrated performance gains through tool learning, verifiable rewards, and continual training, deployed self-improving agents raise unresolved security and governance challenges: optimization pressure can incentivize reward hacking, behavioral drift is difficult to audit or reproduce, and improvements are often entangled in opaque parameter updates rather than reusable, verifiable artifacts.\n  This paper proposes Audited Skill-Graph Self-Improvement (ASG-SI), a framework that treats self-improvement as iterative compilation of an agent into a growing, auditable skill graph. Each candidate improvement is extracted from successful trajectories, normalized into a skill with an explicit interface, and promoted only after passing verifier-backed replay and contract checks. Rewards are decomposed into reconstructible components derived from replayable evidence, enabling independent audit of promotion decisions and learning signals. ASG-SI further integrates experience synthesis for scalable stress testing and continual memory control to preserve long-horizon performance under bounded context.\n  We present a complete system architecture, threat model, and security analysis, and provide a fully runnable reference implementation that demonstrates verifier-backed reward construction, skill compilation, audit logging, and measurable improvement under continual task streams. ASG-SI reframes agentic self-improvement as accumulation of verifiable, reusable capabilities, offering a practical path toward reproducible evaluation and operational governance of self-improving AI

We introduce CASCADE, a self-evolving agentic framework representing an early instantiation of the transition from \"LLM + tool use\" to \"LLM + skill acquisition\". CASCADE enables agents to master complex external tools and codify knowledge through two meta-skills: continuous learning via web search and code extraction, and self-reflection via introspection and knowledge graph exploration, among others. We evaluate CASCADE on SciSkillBench, a benchmark of 116 materials science and chemistry research tasks. CASCADE achieves a 93.3% success rate using GPT-5, compared to 35.4% without evolution mechanisms. We further demonstrate real-world applications in computational analysis, autonomous laboratory experiments, and selective reproduction of published papers.

In practice, the energy-based policies in SAC are often approximated using simple policy classes for efficiency, sacrificing the expressiveness and robustness. In this paper, we propose a variant of the SAC algorithm that parameterizes the policy with flow-based models, leveraging their rich expressiveness. In the algorithm, we evaluate the flow-based policy utilizing the instantaneous change-of-variable technique and update the policy with an online variant of flow matching developed in this paper. This online variant, termed importance sampling flow matching (ISFM), enables policy update with only samples from a user-specified sampling distribution rather than the unknown target distribution. We develop a theoretical analysis of ISFM, characterizing how different choices of sampling distributions affect the learning efficiency. Finally, we conduct a case study of our algorithm on the max-entropy linear quadratic regulator problems, demonstrating that the proposed algorithm learns the optimal action distribution.", "AI": {"tldr": "Soft Actor-Critic(SAC) \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \ubcc0\ud615\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \ud750\ub984 \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "SAC \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uae30\ubc18 \uc815\ucc45\uc740 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc885\uc885 \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \uc815\ucc45 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4\ub85c \uadfc\uc0ac\ud654\ub418\uba70 \uc774\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ud45c\ud604\ub825\uacfc \uac15\uc778\uc131\uc774 \ud76c\uc0dd\ub41c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud750\ub984 \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ud654\ud558\uace0, \uc989\uac01\uc801\uc778 \ubcc0\ud658 \ubcc0\ud654 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud750\ub984 \uae30\ubc18 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uba70, \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ud750\ub984 \ub9e4\uce6d \ubcc0\ud615\uc778 \uc911\uc694 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \ud750\ub984 \ub9e4\uce6d(ISFM)\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc774 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\ub294 \uc0ac\ub840 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc2e4\uc2dc\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "ISFM\uc758 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc5ec \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc120\ud0dd\uc774 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud588\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc18c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc561\ud130-\ud06c\ub9ac\ud2f1(SAC)\uc740 \ucd5c\ub300 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc778\uae30 \uc788\ub294 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc774\ub2e4. \uc2e4\uc81c\ub85c SAC\uc758 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uae30\ubc18 \uc815\ucc45\uc740 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \uc815\ucc45 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uadfc\uc0ac\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\uc544 \ud45c\ud604\ub825\uacfc \uac15\uc778\uc131\uc744 \ud76c\uc0dd\ud558\uac8c \ub41c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud750\ub984 \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ud654\ud558\ub294 SAC \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \ubcc0\ud615\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub4e4\uc758 \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \ud45c\ud604\ub825\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc989\uac01\uc801\uc778 \ubcc0\uc218 \ubcc0\ud654 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud750\ub984 \uae30\ubc18 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0, \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c \uac1c\ubc1c\ub41c \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ud750\ub984 \ub9e4\uce6d\uc758 \ubcc0\ud615\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ubcc0\ud615\uc778 \uc911\uc694 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \ud750\ub984 \ub9e4\uce6d(ISFM)\uc740 \uc54c\ub824\uc9c0\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ubaa9\ud45c \ubd84\ud3ec\uac00 \uc544\ub2cc \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uac00 \uc9c0\uc815\ud55c \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\ucc45 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 ISFM\uc758 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc5ec \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc758 \uc120\ud0dd\uc774 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ud2b9\uc131\ud654\ud588\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c, \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc774 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\ub294 \ucd5c\ub300 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \uc120\ud615 \uc774\ucc28 \uc870\uc808 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0ac\ub840 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud588\ub2e4."}}

The paper introduces Meta Learning Malware Detection (MeLeMaD), a novel framework leveraging the adaptability and generalization capabilities of Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) for malware detection. MeLeMaD incorporates a novel feature selection technique, Chunk-wise Feature Selection based on Gradient Boosting (CFSGB), tailored for handling large-scale, high-dimensional malware datasets, significantly enhancing the detection efficiency. Two benchmark malware datasets (CIC-AndMal2020 and BODMAS) and a custom dataset (EMBOD) were used for rigorously validating the MeLeMaD, achieving a remarkable performance in terms of key evaluation measures, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, MCC, and AUC. With accuracies of 98.04\\% on CIC-AndMal2020 and 99.97\\% on BODMAS, MeLeMaD outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches. The custom dataset, EMBOD, also achieves a commendable accuracy of 97.85\\%.

SCP is built on two foundational pillars: (1) Unified Resource Integration: At its core, SCP provides a universal specification for describing and invoking scientific resources, spanning software tools, models, datasets, and physical instruments. This protocol-level standardization enables AI agents and applications to discover, call, and compose capabilities seamlessly across disparate platforms and institutional boundaries. (2) Orchestrated Experiment Lifecycle Management: SCP complements the protocol with a secure service architecture, which comprises a centralized SCP Hub and federated SCP Servers. This architecture manages the complete experiment lifecycle (registration, planning, execution, monitoring, and archival), enforces fine-grained authentication and authorization, and orchestrates traceable, end-to-end workflows that bridge computational and physical laboratories. Based on SCP, we have constructed a scientific discovery platform that offers researchers and agents a large-scale ecosystem of more than 1,600 tool resources. Across diverse use cases, SCP facilitates secure, large-scale collaboration between heterogeneous AI systems and human researchers while significantly reducing integration overhead and enhancing reproducibility.

Accepted to WEB&GRAPH 2026 (co-located with WSDM 2026), Boise, Idaho, USA, Feb 26, 2026. Final version will appear in WSDM 2026 Companion Proceedings. Conf: https://wsdm-conference.org/2026/ Workshop: https://aiimlab.org/events/WSDM_2026_WEB_and_GRAPH_2026_Workshop_on_Web_and_Graphs_Responsible_Intelligence_and_Social_Media.html", "summary": "Personalized search demands the ability to model users' evolving, multi-dimensional information needs; a challenge for systems constrained by static profiles or monolithic retrieval pipelines. We present SPARK (Search Personalization via Agent-Driven Retrieval and Knowledge-sharing), a framework in which coordinated persona-based large language model (LLM) agents deliver task-specific retrieval and emergent personalization. SPARK formalizes a persona space defined by role, expertise, task context, and domain, and introduces a Persona Coordinator that dynamically interprets incoming queries to activate the most relevant specialized agents. Each agent executes an independent retrieval-augmented generation process, supported by dedicated long- and short-term memory stores and context-aware reasoning modules. Inter-agent collaboration is facilitated through structured communication protocols, including shared memory repositories, iterative debate, and relay-style knowledge transfer. Drawing on principles from cognitive architectures, multi-agent coordination theory, and information retrieval, SPARK models how emergent personalization properties arise from distributed agent behaviors governed by minimal coordination rules. The framework yields testable predictions regarding coordination efficiency, personalization quality, and cognitive load distribution, while incorporating adaptive learning mechanisms for continuous persona refinement. By integrating fine-grained agent specialization with cooperative retrieval, SPARK provides insights for next-generation search systems capable of capturing the complexity, fluidity, and context sensitivity of human information-seeking behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "SPARK\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud2b9\uc815 \uac80\uc0c9\uacfc \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ub300\ud654\ud615 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \uac80\uc0c9 \uac1c\uc778\ud654 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc758 \ub2e4\ucc28\uc6d0\uc801 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \uc694\uad6c\ub418\uba70, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc815\uc801 \ud504\ub85c\ud544\uc774\ub098 \ub2e8\uc77c \uac80\uc0c9 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub835\ub2e4.", "method": "SPARK\ub294 \uc5ed\ud560, \uc804\ubb38\uc131, \uc791\uc5c5 \ub9e5\ub77d, \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc815\uc758\ub41c \ud398\ub974\uc18c\ub098 \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \ud615\uc131\ud558\uace0, \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucffc\ub9ac\ub97c \ud574\uc11d\ud558\uc5ec \uac00\uc7a5 \uad00\ub828\uc131 \ub192\uc740 \uc804\ubb38 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud65c\uc131\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ud398\ub974\uc18c\ub098 \ucf54\ub514\ub124\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uac01 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \uac80\uc0c9 \ubcf4\uac15 \uc0dd\uc131 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \uc2e4\ud589\ud558\uba70, \uc774 \uacfc\uc815\uc740 \uc804\uc6a9\uc758 \uc7a5\uae30 \ubc0f \ub2e8\uae30 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc800\uc7a5\uc18c\uc640 \ub9e5\ub77d \uc778\uc2dd \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ub41c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "SPARK\ub294 \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0\uc11c emergent personalization\uc774 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud55c\uc758 \uc870\uc815 \uaddc\uce59\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc9c0\ubc30\ub41c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c \uac80\uc0c9\uc740 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\ucc28\uc6d0 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc815\uc801 \ud504\ub85c\ud544\uc774\ub098 \ub2e8\uc77c \uac80\uc0c9 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ub3c4\uc804\uc774 \ub41c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 SPARK(\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \uac80\uc0c9 \ubc0f \uc9c0\uc2dd \uacf5\uc720\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \uac80\uc0c9 \uac1c\uc778\ud654)\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.

This study presents a comprehensive benchmark of ten deep learning architectures for short-term (1-hour ahead) GHI time series forecasting in Ho Chi Minh City, leveraging high-resolution NSRDB satellite data (2011-2020) to compare established baselines (e.g. LSTM, TCN) against emerging state-of-the-art architectures, including Transformer, Informer, iTransformer, TSMixer, and Mamba. Experimental results identify the Transformer as the superior architecture, achieving the highest predictive accuracy with an R^2 of 0.9696. The study further utilizes SHAP analysis to contrast the temporal reasoning of these architectures, revealing that Transformers exhibit a strong \"recency bias\" focused on immediate atmospheric conditions, whereas Mamba explicitly leverages 24-hour periodic dependencies to inform predictions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Knowledge Distillation can compress the high-performance Transformer by 23.5% while surprisingly reducing error (MAE: 23.78 W/m^2), offering a proven pathway for deploying sophisticated, low-latency forecasting on resource-constrained edge devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc2ec\uce35\ud559\uc2b5 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uc218\ud3c9 \ubcf5\uc0ac( GHI) \ub2e8\uae30 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0\uc11c Transformer\uac00 \ucd5c\uc0c1\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c4.", "motivation": "GHI \uc608\uce21\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc740 \uc804\ub825\ub9dd\uc5d0\uc11c \ud0dc\uc591\uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0\uc758 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc744 \uc904\uc774\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 2011-2020\ub144\uc758 \uace0\ud574\uc0c1\ub3c4 NSRDB \uc704\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec 10\uac1c\uc758 \uc2ec\uce35 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "Transformer \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uac00 \ucd5c\uace0\uc758 \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4(R\u00b2: 0.9696)\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Knowledge Distillation \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 Transformer\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc790\uc6d0 \uc81c\uc57d\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uc5e3\uc9c0 \ub514\ubc14\uc774\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc800\uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uc218\ud3c9 \ubcf5\uc0ac(GHI)\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc608\uce21\uc740 \uc804\ub825\ub9dd\uc5d0\uc11c \ud0dc\uc591 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0\uc758 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud638\uce58\ubbfc\uc2dc\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ub2e8\uae30(GHI \uc608\uce21 1\uc2dc\uac04 \uc804) \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud574 2011-2020\ub144\uc758 \uace0\ud574\uc0c1\ub3c4 NSRDB \uc704\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\uc874 \uae30\uc900(\uc608: LSTM, TCN)\uacfc Transformer, Informer, iTransformer, TSMixer, Mamba\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \ube44\uad50\ud558\ub294 \uc885\ud569\uc801\uc778 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, Transformer\uac00 R\u00b2 \uac12 0.9696\uc73c\ub85c \ucd5c\uace0\uc758 \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub85c \ud655\uc778\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 SHAP \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc758 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc600\uace0, Transformer\ub294 \uc989\uac01\uc801\uc778 \ub300\uae30 \uc870\uac74\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\ub41c \uac15\ud55c '\ucd5c\uadfc\uc131 \ud3b8\ud5a5'\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\ub294 \ubc18\uba74 Mamba\ub294 24\uc2dc\uac04 \uc8fc\uae30\uc801 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc608\uce21\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc1d\ud614\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, Knowledge Distillation\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uace0\uc131\ub2a5 Transformer\ub97c 23.5% \uc555\ucd95\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \ub180\ub78d\uac8c\ub3c4 \uc624\ucc28(MAE: 23.78 W/m\u00b2)\ub97c \uc904\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uba70, \uc790\uc6d0 \uc81c\uc57d\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uc5e3\uc9c0 \ub514\ubc14\uc774\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\uad50\ud558\uace0 \uc800\uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \ubc30\ud3ec\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac80\uc99d\ub41c \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Despite being used in several recent studies, none has thoroughly analyzed its reliability against evasion attacks aimed at inflating the score of malicious packages, thereby masquerading them as trustworthy. To fill this gap, we first propose a threat model that identifies potential evasion approaches for each metric, including the URL confusion technique, which can affect 5 out of the 18 metrics by leveraging a URL pointing to a legitimate repository potentially unrelated to the malicious package.\n  Furthermore, we study the reliability of SourceRank in the PyPI ecosystem by analyzing the SourceRank distributions of benign and malicious packages in the state-of-the-art MalwareBench dataset, as well as in a real-world dataset of 122,398 packages. Our analysis reveals that, while historical data suggests a clear distinction between benign and malicious packages, the real-world distributions overlap significantly, mainly due to SourceRank's failure to timely reflect package removals. As a result, SourceRank cannot be reliably used to discriminate between benign and malicious packages in real-world scenarios, nor to select benign packages among those available on PyPI.\n  Finally, our analysis reveals that URL confusion represents an emerging attack vector, with its prevalence increasing from 4.2% in MalwareBench to 7.0% in our real-world dataset. Moreover, this technique is often used alongside other evasion techniques and can significantly inflate the SourceRank metrics of malicious packages.", "AI": {"tldr": "SourceRank\uc758

In real-world software engineering, however, such curated datasets are rarely available during the initial cold start of agent development, where engineers instead face messy production logs and evolving failure modes. We present ROAD (Reflective Optimization via Automated Debugging), a novel framework that bypasses the need for refined datasets by treating optimization as a dynamic debugging investigation rather than a stochastic search. Unlike traditional mutation strategies, ROAD utilizes a specialized multi-agent architecture, comprising an Analyzer for root-cause analysis, an Optimizer for pattern aggregation, and a Coach for strategy integration, to convert unstructured failure logs into robust, structured Decision Tree Protocols. We evaluated ROAD across both a standardized academic benchmark and a live production Knowledge Management engine. Experimental results demonstrate that ROAD is highly sample-efficient, achieving a 5.6 percent increase in success rate (73.6 percent to 79.2 percent) and a 3.8 percent increase in search accuracy within just three automated iterations. Furthermore, on complex reasoning tasks in the retail domain, ROAD improved agent performance by approximately 19 percent relative to the baseline. These findings suggest that mimicking the human engineering loop of failure analysis and patching offers a viable, data-efficient alternative to resource-intensive RL training for deploying reliable LLM agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc790\ub3d9 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654(APO)\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uae30\uc220\ub85c \ubd80\uc0c1\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c4\ud654 \ub610\ub294 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL) \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc801\ud569\uc131 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \uacc4\uc0b0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud070 \ub808\uc774\ube14\uc774 \ubd99\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc2e4\uc81c \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\ub9c1\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ucd08\uae30 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc758 \ucc28\uac00\uc6b4 \uc2dc\uc791 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uadf8\ub7ec\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \ucc3e\uc544\ubcf4\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ub4dc\ubb3c\uace0, \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\ub4e4\uc740 \ub300\uc2e0 \ud63c\ub780\uc2a4\ub7ec\uc6b4 \uc0dd\uc0b0 \ub85c\uadf8\uc640 \uc9c4\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc2e4\ud328 \ubaa8\ub4dc\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud55c\ub2e4.

This shift creates an autonomy paradox: as GenAI systems are granted greater operational autonomy, they should, by design, embody more formal structure, more explicit constraints, and stronger tail-risk discipline. We argue stochastic generative models can be fragile in operational domains unless paired with mechanisms that provide verifiable feasibility, robustness to distribution shift, and stress testing under high-consequence scenarios. To address this challenge, we develop a conceptual framework for assured autonomy grounded in operations research (OR), built on two complementary approaches. First, flow-based generative models frame generation as deterministic transport characterized by an ordinary differential equation, enabling auditability, constraint-aware generation, and connections to optimal transport, robust optimization, and sequential decision control. Second, operational safety is formulated through an adversarial robustness lens: decision rules are evaluated against worst-case perturbations within uncertainty or ambiguity sets, making unmodeled risks part of the design. This framework clarifies how increasing autonomy shifts OR's role from solver to guardrail to system architect, with responsibility for control logic, incentive protocols, monitoring regimes, and safety boundaries. These elements define a research agenda for assured autonomy in safety-critical, reliability-sensitive operational domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc0dd\uc131\uc801

Existing methods often struggle with premature convergence and inefficient exploration in high-dimensional code spaces. To address these challenges, we introduce LoongFlow, a self-evolving agent framework that achieves state-of-the-art solution quality with significantly reduced computational costs. Unlike \"blind\" mutation operators, LoongFlow integrates LLMs into a cognitive \"Plan-Execute-Summarize\" (PES) paradigm, effectively mapping the evolutionary search to a reasoning-heavy process. To sustain long-term architectural coherence, we incorporate a hybrid evolutionary memory system. By synergizing Multi-Island models with MAP-Elites and adaptive Boltzmann selection, this system theoretically balances the exploration-exploitation trade-off, maintaining diverse behavioral niches to prevent optimization stagnation. We instantiate LoongFlow with a General Agent for algorithmic discovery and an ML Agent for pipeline optimization. Extensive evaluations on the AlphaEvolve benchmark and Kaggle competitions demonstrate that LoongFlow outperforms leading baselines (e.g., OpenEvolve, ShinkaEvolve) by up to 60% in evolutionary efficiency while discovering superior solutions. LoongFlow marks a substantial step forward in autonomous scientific discovery, enabling the generation of expert-level solutions with reduced computational overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "LoongFlow\ub294 \uc790\uac00 \uc9c4\ud654 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc758 \ubd80\uc871\uacfc \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \uc870\uae30 \uc218\ub834 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uc5ec \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \ud574\uacb0 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uc808\uac10\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc815\uc801 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uac00 \uac1c\uc120 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c\uc758 \uc804\ud658\uc774 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc9c4\ud654\uc801 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc5d0\uc11c \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ubd80\uc871\uc73c\ub85c \ubc29\ud574\ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "LoongFlow\ub294 LLM\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc778\uc9c0\uc801 '\uacc4\ud68d-\uc2e4\ud589-\uc694\uc57d'(PES) \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uace0, \ud63c\ud569 \uc9c4\ud654 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud0d0\uc0c9-\uac1c\ubc1c \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "LoongFlow\ub294 AlphaEvolve \uae30\uc900 \ubc0f Kaggle \ub300\ud68c\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ucd5c\ub300 60% \ub354 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc9c4\ud654 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "LoongFlow\ub294 \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \ubc1c\uacac\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc9c4\uc804\uc744 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4 \ub0b4\uba70, \uac10\uc18c\ub41c \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc815\uc801 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uac00 \uac1c\uc120 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c\uc758 \uc804\ud658\uc740 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc9c4\ud654\uc801 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc5d0\uc11c \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc758 \ubd80\uc871\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ubc29\ud574\ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc870\uae30 \uc218\ub834\uacfc \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \ucf54\ub4dc \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 LoongFlow\ub77c\ub294 \uc790\uac00 \uc9c4\ud654 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.

However, existing GRL methods often rely on surrogate contrastive objectives or mutual information maximization, which typically demand complex architectures, negative sampling strategies, and sensitive hyperparameter tuning. These design choices may induce over-smoothing, over-squashing, and training instability. In this work, we propose HyperGRL, a unified framework for hyperspherical graph representation learning via adaptive neighbor-mean alignment and sampling-free uniformity. HyperGRL embeds nodes on a unit hypersphere through two adversarially coupled objectives: neighbor-mean alignment and sampling-free uniformity. The alignment objective uses the mean representation of each node's local neighborhood to construct semantically grounded, stable targets that capture shared structural and feature patterns. The uniformity objective formulates dispersion via an L2-based hyperspherical regularization, encouraging globally uniform embedding distributions while preserving discriminative information. To further stabilize training, we introduce an entropy-guided adaptive balancing mechanism that dynamically regulates the interplay between alignment and uniformity without requiring manual tuning. Extensive experiments on node classification, node clustering, and link prediction demonstrate that HyperGRL delivers superior representation quality and generalization across diverse graph structures, achieving average improvements of 1.49%, 0.86%, and 0.74% over the strongest existing methods, respectively. These findings highlight the effectiveness of geometrically grounded, sampling-free contrastive objectives for graph representation learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "HyperGRL\uc740 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\uad6c \ub0b4\ubd80\uc5d0\uc11c \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc774\uc6c3 \ud3c9\uade0 \uc815\ub82c\uacfc \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \uc5c6\ub294 \uade0\uc77c\uc131\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc784\ubca0\ub529 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc640 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubd88\uc548\uc815\uc131 \ubc0f \uacfc\ub3c4\ud55c \uc2a4\ubb34\ub529\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "HyperGRL\uc740 \uc774\uc6c3 \ud3c9\uade0 \uc815\ub82c \ubc0f \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \uc5c6\ub294 \uade0\uc77c\uc131\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\uad6c \ud45c\uba74\uc5d0 \ub178\ub4dc\ub97c \uc784\ubca0\ub529\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "HyperGRL\uc740 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ucd5c\uac15 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud3c9\uade0 1.49%, 0.86%, 0.74%\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \u0433\u0435\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0440\ud558\uac8c \uae30\ubc18\ud55c, \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \uc5c6\ub294 \ub300\uc870 \ubaa9\ud45c\uac00 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc784\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5(GRL)\uc740 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uad6c\uc870 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ubc0f \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \uc800\ucc28\uc6d0 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874\uc758 GRL \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98, \ubd80\uc815 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \uc804\ub7b5 \ubc0f \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \ub300\ub9ac \ub300\uc870 \ubaa9\ud45c \ub610\ub294 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc815\ubcf4 \ucd5c\ub300\ud654\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc124\uacc4 \uc120\ud0dd\uc740 \uacfc\ub3c4\ud55c \uc2a4\ubb34\ub529, \uacfc\ub3c4\ud55c \uc555\ucd95, \ud6c8\ub828 \ubd88\uc548\uc815\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc774\uc6c3 \ud3c9\uade0 \uc815\ub82c \ubc0f \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \uc5c6\ub294 \uade0\uc77c\uc131\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\uad6c \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 HyperGRL\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Recent generative steganography methods, particularly those based on diffusion models, can embed high-capacity payloads without fine-tuning or auxiliary decoders, creating significant challenges for detection and remediation. Coverless diffusion-based techniques are difficult to counter because they generate image carriers directly from secret data, enabling attackers to deliver stegomalware for command-and-control, payload staging, and data exfiltration while bypassing detectors that rely on cover-stego discrepancies. This work introduces Adversarial Diffusion Sanitization (ADS), a training-free defense for security gateways that neutralizes hidden payloads rather than detecting them. ADS employs an off-the-shelf pretrained denoiser as a differentiable proxy for diffusion-based decoders and incorporates a color-aware, quaternion-coupled update rule to reduce artifacts under strict distortion limits.

However, they are constrained by several critical challenges, including their inherent \"Black-Box\" characteristics, susceptibility to knowledge hallucination, and limited online learning capacity. These factors compromise their trustworthiness and adaptability. Conversely, cognitive architectures such as Soar offer structured and interpretable reasoning processes, yet their knowledge acquisition is notoriously laborious. To address these complementary challenges, we propose a novel cognitive recommender agent called CogRec which synergizes the strengths of LLMs with the Soar cognitive architecture. CogRec leverages Soar as its core symbolic reasoning engine and leverages an LLM for knowledge initialization to populate its working memory with production rules. The agent operates on a Perception-Cognition-Action(PCA) cycle. Upon encountering an impasse, it dynamically queries the LLM to obtain a reasoned solution. This solution is subsequently transformed into a new symbolic production rule via Soar's chunking mechanism, thereby enabling robust online learning.

As a critical hyperparameter for DFL, the mixing matrix controls both the convergence rate and the needs of agent-to-agent communications, and has thus been studied extensively. However, existing designs mostly focused on minimizing the communication time, leaving open the minimization of per-node energy consumption that is critical for energy-constrained devices. This work addresses this gap through a theoretically-justified solution for mixing matrix design that aims at minimizing the maximum per-node energy consumption until convergence, while taking into account the broadcast nature of wireless communications. Based on a novel convergence theorem that allows arbitrarily time-varying mixing matrices, we propose a multi-phase design framework that activates time-varying communication topologies under optimized budgets to trade off the per-iteration energy consumption and the convergence rate while balancing the energy consumption across nodes. Our evaluations based on real data have validated the efficacy of the proposed solution in combining the low energy consumption of sparse mixing matrices and the fast convergence of dense mixing matrices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubb34\uc120 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud63c\ud569 \ud589\ub82c \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uba70, \ucd5c\ub300 \uac1c\ubcc4 \ub178\ub4dc \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc18c\ube44\ub97c \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd98\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubd84\uc0b0 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud63c\ud569 \ud589\ub82c\uc740 \uc218\ub834 \uc18d\ub3c4\uc640 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc694\uad6c\ub97c \ubaa8\ub450 \uc81c\uc5b4\ud558\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130\ub85c, \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc81c\uc57d \uc7a5\uce58\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uac1c\ubcc4 \ub178\ub4dc \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc18c\ube44\ub97c \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud574\uc57c \ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc2dc\uac04 \ubcc0\ud654\uac00 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud63c\ud569 \ud589\ub82c\uc744 \ud5c8\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc218\ub834 \uc815\ub9ac\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uc5ec, \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub41c \uc608\uc0b0 \ud558\uc5d0 \uac1c\ubcc4 \ubc18\ubcf5 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc18c\ube44\uc640 \uc218\ub834 \uc18d\ub3c4\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ub2e8\uacc4 \uc124\uacc4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc740 \ud76c\uc18c \ud63c\ud569 \ud589\ub82c\uc758 \ub0ae\uc740 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc18c\ube44\uc640 \ubc00\uc9d1 \ud63c\ud569 \ud589\ub82c\uc758 \ube60\ub978 \uc218\ub834\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc784\uc744 \uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uc5ec \uac80\uc99d\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ud63c\ud569 \ud589\ub82c \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\ub2f9\ud654\ub41c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368, \ubb34\uc120 \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc758 \ubc29\uc1a1 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud558\uc5ec \ucd5c\ub300 \uac1c\ubcc4 \ub178\ub4dc \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc18c\ube44\ub97c \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uae30\ud68c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubb34\uc120 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5(DFL)\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud63c\ud569 \ud589\ub82c \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \uace0\ub824\ud558\uba70, \ucd5c\ub300 \uac1c\ubcc4 \ub178\ub4dc \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc18c\ube44\ub97c \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc8fc\ubaa9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

In scenarios where each participant is responsible for its dataset, e.g., digital forensics, MP-PSI with threshold should disclose both intersection elements and corresponding holders such that elements are traceable and the reliability of intersection is guaranteed. We refer to MP-PSI with threshold supporting traceability as Traceable Over-Threshold MP-PSI (T-OT-MP-PSI). However, research on such protocols remains limited, and existing work tolerates at most $t-2$ semi-honest participants at considerable computational cost. We propose two novel Traceable OT-MP-PSI protocols. The first, Efficient Traceable OT-MP-PSI (ET-OT-MP-PSI), combines Shamir's secret sharing with an oblivious programmable pseudorandom function, achieving significantly improved efficiency with resistance to at most $t-2$ semi-honest participants.

ARC-AGI-3 comprises game-like tasks where agents must infer task mechanics through limited interactions, and adapt to increasing complexity as levels progress. Success requires forming hypotheses, testing them, and tracking discovered mechanics. The benchmark has revealed that state-of-the-art LLMs are currently incapable of reliably solving these tasks. Our method combines vision-based frame processing with systematic state-space exploration using graph-structured representations. It segments visual frames into meaningful components, prioritizes actions based on visual salience, and maintains a directed graph of explored states and transitions. By tracking visited states and tested actions, the agent prioritizes actions that provide the shortest path to untested state-action pairs. On the ARC-AGI-3 Preview Challenge, this structured exploration strategy solves a median of 30 out of 52 levels across six games and ranks 3rd on the private leaderboard, substantially outperforming frontier LLM-based agents. These results demonstrate that explicit graph-structured exploration, even without learning, can serve as a strong baseline for interactive reasoning and underscore the importance of systematic state tracking and action prioritization in sparse-feedback environments where current LLMs fail to capture task dynamics.

Despite the findings of earlier research that has cast doubt on the effectiveness of LLMs leveraging self critique methods, we show significant performance gains on planning datasets in the Blocksworld domain through intrinsic self-critique, without external source such as a verifier. We also demonstrate similar improvements on Logistics and Mini-grid datasets, exceeding strong baseline accuracies. We employ a few-shot learning technique and progressively extend it to a many-shot approach as our base method and demonstrate that it is possible to gain substantial improvement on top of this already competitive approach by employing an iterative process for correction and refinement.

This dynamic frequently gives rise to previously unknown attacks that can circumvent current detection and prevention. This necessitates the continual updating of security mechanisms. Constructing generative AI with provable security and theoretically controllable risk is therefore necessary. Consensus Sampling (CS) is a promising algorithm toward provably secure AI. It controls risk by leveraging overlap in model output probabilities. However, we find that CS relies on frequent abstention to avoid unsafe outputs, which reduces utility. Moreover, CS becomes highly vulnerable when unsafe models are maliciously manipulated. To address these issues, we propose a new primitive called Reliable Consensus Sampling (RCS), that traces acceptance probability to tolerate extreme adversarial behaviors, improving robustness. RCS also eliminates the need for abstention entirely. We further develop a feedback algorithm to continuously and dynamically enhance the safety of RCS. We provide theoretical guarantees that RCS maintains a controllable risk threshold. Extensive experiments show that RCS significantly improves robustness and utility while maintaining latency comparable to CS.

Project: https://tinnerhrhe.github.io/gardo_project", "summary": "Fine-tuning diffusion models via online reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great potential for enhancing text-to-image alignment. However, since precisely specifying a ground-truth objective for visual tasks remains challenging, the models are often optimized using a proxy reward that only partially captures the true goal. This mismatch often leads to reward hacking, where proxy scores increase while real image quality deteriorates and generation diversity collapses. While common solutions add regularization against the reference policy to prevent reward hacking, they compromise sample efficiency and impede the exploration of novel, high-reward regions, as the reference policy is usually sub-optimal. To address the competing demands of sample efficiency, effective exploration, and mitigation of reward hacking, we propose Gated and Adaptive Regularization with Diversity-aware Optimization (GARDO), a versatile framework compatible with various RL algorithms. Our key insight is that regularization need not be applied universally; instead, it is highly effective to selectively penalize a subset of samples that exhibit high uncertainty. To address the exploration challenge, GARDO introduces an adaptive regularization mechanism wherein the reference model is periodically updated to match the capabilities of the online policy, ensuring a relevant regularization target. To address the mode collapse issue in RL, GARDO amplifies the rewards for high-quality samples that also exhibit high diversity, encouraging mode coverage without destabilizing the optimization process. Extensive experiments across diverse proxy rewards and hold-out unseen metrics consistently show that GARDO mitigates reward hacking and enhances generation diversity without sacrificing sample efficiency or exploration, highlighting its effectiveness and robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "GARDO\ub294 \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \ud0d0\uc0c9, \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud574\ud0b9 \uc644\ud654\ub97c

Most existing safety alignment methods, such as Safe RLHF and SACPO, typically operate under a risk-neutral paradigm that is insufficient to address the risks arising from deviations from the reference policy and offers limited robustness against rare but potentially catastrophic harmful behaviors. To address this limitation, we propose Risk-aware Stepwise Alignment (RSA), a novel alignment method that explicitly incorporates risk awareness into the policy optimization process by leveraging a class of nested risk measures. Specifically, RSA formulates safety alignment as a token-level risk-aware constrained policy optimization problem and solves it through a stepwise alignment procedure that yields token-level policy updates derived from the nested risk measures. This design offers two key benefits: (1) it mitigates risks induced by excessive model shift away from a reference policy, and (2) it explicitly suppresses low-probability yet high-impact harmful behaviors.

Although exact distribution-free conditional coverage is impossible with finite samples, recent work has focused on improving the conditional coverage of standard conformal procedures. Distinct from approaches that target relaxed notions of conditional coverage, we directly minimize the mean squared error of conditional coverage by refining the quantile regression components that underpin many conformal methods. Leveraging a Taylor expansion, we derive a sharp surrogate objective for quantile regression: a density-weighted pinball loss, where the weights are given by the conditional density of the conformity score evaluated at the true quantile. We propose a three-headed quantile network that estimates these weights via finite differences using auxiliary quantile levels at \\(1-\u03b1\\pm \u03b4\\), subsequently fine-tuning the central quantile by optimizing the weighted loss. We provide a theoretical analysis with exact non-asymptotic guarantees characterizing the resulting excess risk.

Our agent maintains an external structured belief over the environment state, iteratively updates it via action-conditioned observations, and selects actions by maximizing predicted information gain over the belief space. We estimate information gain using a lightweight LLM-based surrogate and assess world alignment through a novel reward that quantifies the consistency between posterior belief and ground-truth environment configuration. Experiments show that our method outperforms inference-time scaling baselines such as prompt-augmented or retrieval-enhanced LLMs, in aligning with latent world states with significantly lower integration overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubd80\ubd84 \uad00\uce21 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\ub294 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub098 \ucd94\uac00 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \ud6c4\ud589 \uc9c0\uce68 \uae30\ubc18 \uc2e0\ub150 \uc815\uc81c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc801\uc751 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \ubaa9\uc801\uc740 \ubd80\ubd84\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad00\uce21 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc81c\uc548\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ud658\uacbd \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc678\ubd80 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc2e0\ub150\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uace0, \ud589\ub3d9 \uc870\uac74 \uad00\ucc30\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\ub97c \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ud558\uba70, \uc2e0\ub150 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ub300 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc774\uc775\uc744 \ucd94\uad6c\ud558\uc5ec \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc120\ud0dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc815\ubcf4 \uc774\uc775\uc740 \uacbd\ub7c9 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ub300\ub9ac \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ucd94\uc815\ud558\uba70, \ud6c4\ud589 \uc2e0\ub150\uacfc \uc2e4\uc81c \ud658\uacbd \uad6c\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc138\uacc4 \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc81c\uc548\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc99d\uac15 \ub610\ub294 \uac80\uc0c9 \uac15\ud654 LLM\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1 \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc744 \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\uc5ec \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801\uc778 \uc138\uacc4 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc640\uc758 \uc815\ub82c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud1b5\ud569 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\uac00 \ud604\uc800\ud788 \ub0ae\uc558\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc2e0\ub150 \uc815\uc81c \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc801\uc751 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \uc800\ube44\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \ub192\uc740 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubd80\ubd84 \uad00\uce21 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\ub294 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub098 \ucd94\uac00 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \ud6c4\ud589 \uc9c0\uce68 \uae30\ubc18 \uc2e0\ub150 \uc815\uc81c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc801\uc751 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ud658\uacbd \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc678\ubd80 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc2e0\ub150\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uace0, \ud589\ub3d9 \uc870\uac74 \uad00\ucc30\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\ub97c \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ud558\uba70, \uc2e0\ub150 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ub300\ud55c\uc758 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc774\uc775\uc744 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc120\ud0dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uacbd\ub7c9 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ub300\ub9ac \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\ubcf4 \uc774\uc775\uc744 \ucd94\uc815\ud558\uace0, \ud6c4\ud589 \uc2e0\ub150\uacfc \uc2e4\uc81c \ud658\uacbd \uad6c\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc138\uacc4 \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc99d\uac15 \ub610\ub294 \uac80\uc0c9 \uac15\ud654 LLM\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1 \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc744 \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\uc5ec \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801\uc778 \uc138\uacc4 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc640\uc758 \uc815\ub82c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \ub0ae\uc740 \ud1b5\ud569 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

The timely prediction of sepsis progression is crucial for reducing adverse outcomes through early intervention. Despite the development of numerous models for Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients, there remains a notable gap in approaches for the early detection of sepsis in non-ward settings. This research introduces and evaluates four novel machine learning algorithms designed for predicting the onset of sepsis on wearable devices by analyzing heart rate data. The architecture of these models was refined through a genetic algorithm, optimizing for performance, computational complexity, and memory requirements. Performance metrics were subsequently extracted for each model to evaluate their feasibility for implementation on wearable devices capable of accurate heart rate monitoring. The models were initially tailored for a prediction window of one hour, later extended to four hours through transfer learning. The encouraging outcomes of this study suggest the potential for wearable technology to facilitate early sepsis detection outside ICU and ward environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc6e8\uc5b4\ub7ec\ube14 \uc7a5\uce58\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \ud328\ud608\uc99d \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uace0 \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud328\ud608\uc99d\uc740 \uac10\uc5fc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc870\uc808\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uba74\uc5ed \ubc18\uc751\uc73c\ub85c, \uc0ac\ub9dd\ub960, \uc9c8\ubcd1 \ubd80\ub2f4, \uc758\ub8cc\ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub192\ub2e4. \uc870\uae30 \uac1c\uc785\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub098\uc05c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc904\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud328\ud608\uc99d \uc9c4\ud589\uc758 \uc2e0\uc18d\ud55c \uc608\uce21\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc2ec\ubc15\uc218 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc5ec \uc6e8\uc5b4\ub7ec\ube14 \uc7a5\uce58\uc5d0\uc11c \ud328\ud608\uc99d\uc758 \ubc1c\ubcd1\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0 \ud3c9\uac00\ud588\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5, \uacc4\uc0b0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131 \ubc0f \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc720\uc804\uc790 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc815\uad50\ud654\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uac01 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 metric\uc744 \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc2ec\ubc15\uc218 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc6e8\uc5b4\ub7ec\ube14 \uc7a5\uce58\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uad6c\ud604 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud588\ub2e4. \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ucc98\uc74c\uc5d0 1\uc2dc\uac04\uc758 \uc608\uce21 \uae30\uac04\uc744 \uc124\uc815\ud55c \ud6c4, \uc804\uc774 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 4\uc2dc\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \uace0\ubb34\uc801\uc778 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc6e8\uc5b4\ub7ec\ube14 \uae30\uc220\uc774 ICU \ubc0f \ubcd1\uc2e4 \ud658\uacbd \uc678\ubd80\uc5d0\uc11c \uc870\uae30 \ud328\ud608\uc99d \uac10\uc9c0\ub97c \ucd09\uc9c4\ud560 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud328\ud608\uc99d\uc740 \uac10\uc5fc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uba74\uc5ed \ubc18\uc751\uc758 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \uc870\uc808\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uba70, \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc0ac\ub9dd\ub960, \uc774\ud658\uc728 \ubc0f \uc758\ub8cc \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc870\uae30 \uac1c\uc785\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubd88\ub9ac\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc904\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud328\ud608\uc99d \uc9c4\ud589\uc744 \uc2e0\uc18d\ud558\uac8c \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc911\ud658\uc790\uc2e4(ICU) \ud658\uc790\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc218\ub9ce\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uac1c\ubc1c\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\ub098, \ubcd1\uc2e4 \ud658\uacbd \uc678\ubd80\uc5d0\uc11c \ud328\ud608\uc99d\uc744 \uc870\uae30\uc5d0 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\ub294 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc5d0 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ucc28\uc774\uac00 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc2ec\ubc15\uc218 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc5ec \uc6e8\uc5b4\ub7ec\ube14 \uc7a5\uce58\uc5d0\uc11c \ud328\ud608\uc99d \ubc1c\ubcd1\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uace0 \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5, \uacc4\uc0b0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131 \ubc0f \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc720\uc804\uc790 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e4\ub4ec\uc5b4\uc84c\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ud6c4 \uac01 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc9c0\ud45c\ub97c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc2ec\ubc15\uc218 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc6e8\uc5b4\ub7ec\ube14 \uc7a5\uce58\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uad6c\ud604 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ucc98\uc74c\uc5d0 1\uc2dc\uac04\uc758 \uc608\uce21 \ucc3d\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc870\uc815\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ud6c4 \uc804\uc774 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 4\uc2dc\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \uace0\ubb34\uc801\uc778 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc6e8\uc5b4\ub7ec\ube14 \uae30\uc220\uc774 ICU \ubc0f \ubcd1\uc2e4 \ud658\uacbd \uc678\ubd80\uc5d0\uc11c \uc870\uae30 \ud328\ud608\uc99d \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub97c \ucd09\uc9c4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

A popular recent approach involves training a world model from state-action trajectories and subsequently use it with a planning algorithm to solve new tasks. Planning is commonly performed in the input space, but a recent family of methods has introduced planning algorithms that optimize in the learned representation space of the world model, with the promise that abstracting irrelevant details yields more efficient planning. In this work, we characterize models from this family as JEPA-WMs and investigate the technical choices that make algorithms from this class work. We propose a comprehensive study of several key components with the objective of finding the optimal approach within the family. We conducted experiments using both simulated environments and real-world robotic data, and studied how the model architecture, the training objective, and the planning algorithm affect planning success. We combine our findings to propose a model that outperforms two established baselines, DINO-WM and V-JEPA-2-AC, in both navigation and manipulation tasks.

Recent work has explored leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) as sources of prior causal knowledge, but existing approaches rely on heuristic integration that lacks theoretical grounding. We introduce HOLOGRAPH, a framework that formalizes LLM-guided causal discovery through sheaf theory--representing local causal beliefs as sections of a presheaf over variable subsets. Our key insight is that coherent global causal structure corresponds to the existence of a global section, while topological obstructions manifest as non-vanishing sheaf cohomology. We propose the Algebraic Latent Projection to handle hidden confounders and Natural Gradient Descent on the belief manifold for principled optimization. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that HOLOGRAPH provides rigorous mathematical foundations while achieving competitive performance on causal discovery tasks with 50-100 variables. Our sheaf-theoretic analysis reveals that while Identity, Transitivity, and Gluing axioms are satisfied to numerical precision (<10^{-6}), the Locality axiom fails for larger graphs, suggesting fundamental non-local coupling in latent variable projections.

Understanding how foundation model (FM) agents understand and act in such environments is therefore critical for enabling reliable map-based reasoning and applications. However, most existing evaluations of spatial ability in FMs rely on static map inputs or text-based queries, overlooking the interactive and experience-driven nature of spatial understanding.In this paper, we propose an interactive evaluation framework to analyze how FM agents explore, remember, and reason in symbolic map environments. Agents incrementally explore partially observable grid-based maps consisting of roads, intersections, and points of interest (POIs), receiving only local observations at each step. Spatial understanding is then evaluated using six kinds of spatial tasks. By systematically varying exploration strategies, memory representations, and reasoning schemes across multiple foundation models, we reveal distinct functional roles of these components. Exploration primarily affects experience acquisition but has a limited impact on final reasoning accuracy. In contrast, memory representation plays a central role in consolidating spatial experience, with structured memories particularly sequential and graph-based representations, substantially improving performance on structure-intensive tasks such as path planning. Reasoning schemes further shape how stored spatial knowledge is used, with advanced prompts supporting more effective multi-step inference. We further observe that spatial reasoning performance saturates across model versions and scales beyond a certain capability threshold, indicating that improvements in map-based spatial understanding require mechanisms tailored to spatial representation and reasoning rather than scaling alone.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378(FM) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00

Existing defenses face a critical dilemma: Adversarial Training (AT) provides robustness but incurs a prohibitive computational burden, while certified methods like Randomized Smoothing (RS) introduce significant inference latency, rendering them impractical for real-time clinical monitoring. We posit that this vulnerability stems from the models' reliance on non-robust spurious correlations rather than invariant pathological features. To address this, we propose Causal Physiological Representation Learning (CPR). Unlike standard denoising approaches that operate without semantic constraints, CPR incorporates a Physiological Structural Prior within a causal disentanglement framework. By modeling ECG generation via a Structural Causal Model (SCM), CPR enforces a structural intervention that strictly separates invariant pathological morphology (P-QRS-T complex) from non-causal artifacts. Empirical results on PTB-XL demonstrate that CPR significantly outperforms standard clinical preprocessing methods. Specifically, under SAP attacks, CPR achieves an F1 score of 0.632, surpassing Median Smoothing (0.541 F1) by 9.1%.

Current MCP evaluation sets suffer from issues such as reliance on external MCP services and a lack of difficulty awareness. To address these limitations, we propose MCPAgentBench, a benchmark based on real-world MCP definitions designed to evaluate the tool-use capabilities of agents. We construct a dataset containing authentic tasks and simulated MCP tools. The evaluation employs a dynamic sandbox environment that presents agents with candidate tool lists containing distractors, thereby testing their tool selection and discrimination abilities. Furthermore, we introduce comprehensive metrics to measure both task completion rates and execution efficiency.

While existing literature has explored user acceptance of autonomous taxis through stated preference experiments and hypothetical scenarios, few studies have investigated actual user behavior based on operational AV services. This study addresses that gap by leveraging survey data from Wuhan, China, where Baidu's Apollo Robotaxi service operates at scale. We design a realistic survey incorporating actual service attributes and collect 336 valid responses from actual users. Using Structural Equation Modeling, we identify six latent psychological constructs, namely Trust \\& Policy Support, Cost Sensitivity, Performance, Behavioral Intention, Lifestyle, and Education. Their influences on adoption behavior, measured by the selection frequency of autonomous taxis in ten scenarios, are examined and interpreted. Results show that Cost Sensitivity and Behavioral Intention are the strongest positive predictors of adoption, while other latent constructs play more nuanced roles. The model demonstrates strong goodness-of-fit across multiple indices. Our findings offer empirical evidence to support policymaking, fare design, and public outreach strategies for scaling autonomous taxis deployments in real-world urban settings.", "AI": {"tldr":

We present a reinforcement learning-augmented LLM agent framework that formulates cooperation as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP) and adopts centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE). We introduce Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to jointly optimize agent policies with access to global signals during training, together with a simplified joint reward that balances task quality, speed, and coordination cost. On collaborative writing and coding benchmarks, our framework delivers a 3x increase in task processing speed over single-agent baselines, 98.7% structural/style consistency in writing, and a 74.6% test pass rate in coding. The approach consistently outperforms strong multi-agent LLM baselines and provides a practical path toward reliable collaboration in complex workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud611\uc5c5 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM\uc774 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc \ud611\uc5c5 \uc778\uc2dd \ubd80\uc871\uacfc \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\ub294\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud611\ub825\uc744 \ubd84\uc0b0\ub41c \ubd80\ubd84 \uad00\uce21 \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815(Dec-POMDP)\uc73c\ub85c \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uace0, \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uc911 \ud6c8\ub828\uacfc \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc2e4\ud589(CTDE)\uc744 \ucc44\ud0dd\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uad50\uc721 \uc911 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uc2e0\ud638\uc5d0 \uc811\uadfc\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uacf5\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uadf8\ub8f9 \uc0c1\ub300 \uc815\ucc45 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654(GRPO)\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud611\uc5c5 \uc791\ubb38 \ubc0f \ucf54\ub529 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\uc900\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc791\uc5c5 \ucc98\ub9ac \uc18d\ub3c4\uac00 3\ubc30 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0, \uc791\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c 98.7%\uc758 \uad6c\uc870/\uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, \ucf54\ub529\uc5d0\uc11c 74.6%\uc758 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud569\uaca9\ub960\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 LLM \uae30\uc900\uc744 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\uba70 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud611\uc5c5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc88b\uc740 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc \ud611\uc5c5 \uc778\uc2dd\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uace0 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uc131\ub2a5 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud611\uc5c5\uc744 \ubd84\uc0b0\ub41c \ubd80\ubd84 \uad00\uce21 \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815(Dec-POMDP)\uc73c\ub85c \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uc911 \ud6c8\ub828\uacfc \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc2e4\ud589(CTDE)\uc744 \ucc44\ud0dd\ud55c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc99d\uac15 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uad50\uc721 \uc911 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uc2e0\ud638\uc5d0 \uc811\uadfc\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uacf5\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uadf8\ub8f9 \uc0c1\ub300 \uc815\ucc45 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654(GRPO)\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uba70, \uc791\uc5c5 \ud488\uc9c8, \uc18d\ub3c4 \ubc0f \uc870\uc815 \ube44\uc6a9\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ub9de\ucd98 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud654\ub41c \uacf5\ub3d9 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud611\uc5c5 \uc791\ubb38 \ubc0f \ucf54\ub529 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\uc900\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc791\uc5c5 \ucc98\ub9ac \uc18d\ub3c4\uac00 3\ubc30 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0, \uc791\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c 98.7%\uc758 \uad6c\uc870/\uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, \ucf54\ub529\uc5d0\uc11c 74.6%\uc758 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud569\uaca9\ub960\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 LLM \uae30\uc900\uc744 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\uba70 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud611\uc5c5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Steleac", "Mohan Sridharan", "David Abel"], "title": "Discovering Coordinated Joint Options via Inter-Agent Relative Dynamics", "comment": null, "summary": "Temporally extended actions improve the ability to explore and plan in single-agent settings. In multi-agent settings, the exponential growth of the joint state space with the number of agents makes coordinated behaviours even more valuable. Yet, this same exponential growth renders the design of multi-agent options particularly challenging. Existing multi-agent option discovery methods often sacrifice coordination by producing loosely coupled or fully independent behaviours. Toward addressing these limitations, we describe a novel approach for multi-agent option discovery. Specifically, we propose a joint-state abstraction that compresses the state space while preserving the information necessary to discover strongly coordinated behaviours. Our approach builds on the inductive bias that synchronisation over agent states provides a natural foundation for coordination in the absence of explicit objectives. We first approximate a fictitious state of maximal alignment with the team, the \\textit{Fermat} state, and use it to define a measure of \\textit{spreadness}, capturing team-level misalignment on each individual state dimension. Building on this representation, we then employ a neural graph Laplacian estimator to derive options that capture state synchronisation patterns between agents. We evaluate the resulting options across multiple scenarios in two multi-agent domains, showing that they yield stronger downstream coordination capabilities compared to alternative option discovery

The model adopts a three-level role division architecture consisting of generation, verification, and integration. An opinion generation agent produces diverse reasoning perspectives, an evidence verification agent retrieves external knowledge and quantifies factual support, and a consistency arbitration agent integrates logically coherent conclusions. A self-game mechanism is introduced to expand multi-path reasoning trajectories, while a retrieval enhancement module dynamically supplements external knowledge. A composite reward function combining factual consistency and logical coherence is designed, and an improved proximal policy optimization strategy is applied for collaborative training. Experimental results show that the proposed model improves multi-hop reasoning accuracy by 16.8 percent on HotpotQA, 14.3 percent on 2WikiMultihopQA, and 19.2 percent on MeetingBank, while improving consistency by 21.5 percent. The model achieves higher reasoning efficiency than mainstream multi-agent approaches, providing an effective and stable solution for complex reasoning tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e8\uc77c \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uadf8\ub8f9 \uc2ec\uc758 \uc9c0\ud5a5\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ub300\ud654 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e8\uc77c \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc0dd\uc131, \uac80\uc99d \ubc0f \ud1b5\ud569\uc758 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc5ed\ud560 \ubd84\ub2f4 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \ucc44\ud0dd\ud558\uc5ec \uad81\uadf9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uad00\uc810\uc744 \uc0dd\uc0b0\ud558\uace0, \uc678\ubd80 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uac80\uc0c9\ud558\uace0 \uc0ac\uc2e4\uc801 \uc9c0\uc6d0\uc744 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\uba70, \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uacb0\ub860\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uad6c\uc131\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 HotpotQA\uc5d0\uc11c 16.8%, 2WikiMultihopQA\uc5d0\uc11c 14.3%, MeetingBank\uc5d0\uc11c 19.2%\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \uacbd\ub85c \ucd94\ub860 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0, \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 21.5% \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf30\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc8fc\ub958 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \ucd94\ub860 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e8\uc77c \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uadf8\ub8f9 \uc2ec\uc758 \uc9c0\ud5a5\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ub300\ud654 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc0dd\uc131, \uac80\uc99d \ubc0f \ud1b5\ud569\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc5ed\ud560 \ubd84\ub2f4 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \ucc44\ud0dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc758\uacac \uc0dd\uc131 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uad00\uc810\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uc99d\uac70 \uac80\uc99d \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc678\ubd80 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uac80\uc0c9\ud558\uc5ec \uc0ac\uc2e4\uc801 \uc9c0\uc6d0\uc744 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\uba70, \uc77c\uad00\uc131 \uc911\uc7ac \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uacb0\ub860\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc911 \uacbd\ub85c \ucd94\ub860 \uada4\uc801\uc744 \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc790\uae30 \uac8c\uc784 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774 \ub3c4\uc785\ub418\uace0, \uac80\uc0c9 \uac15\ud654 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc774 \uc678\ubd80 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\uc644\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc0ac\uc2e4\uc801 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uacfc \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \ubcf5\ud569 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218\uac00 \uc124\uacc4\ub418\uba70, \ud611\ub825 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uac1c\uc120\ub41c \uadfc\uc811 \uc815\ucc45 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc804\ub7b5\uc774 \uc801\uc6a9\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 HotpotQA\uc5d0\uc11c 16.8%, 2WikiMultihopQA\uc5d0\uc11c 14.3%, MeetingBank\uc5d0\uc11c 19.2%\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud649 \ucd94\ub860 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 21.5% \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf30\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc8fc\ub958 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \ucd94\ub860 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

By leveraging the learned spatiotemporal probability distribution of the AOD field as a generative prior, this framework can be flexibly adapted to various reconstruction tasks without requiring task-specific retraining. We first introduce a corruption-aware training strategy to learns a spatiotemporal AOD prior solely from naturally incomplete data. Subsequently, we employ a decoupled annealing posterior sampling strategy that enables the more effective and integration of heterogeneous observations as constraints to guide the generation process. We validate the proposed framework through extensive experiments on Reanalysis data. Results across downscaling and inpainting tasks confirm the efficacy and robustness of AODDiff, specifically demonstrating its advantage in maintaining high spatial spectral fidelity.

Building a high-quality agent often requires extensive manual effort in tool integration and prompt engineering, while deployed agents struggle to adapt to dynamic environments without expensive fine-tuning. To address these issues, we propose \\textbf{Youtu-Agent}, a modular framework designed for the automated generation and continuous evolution of LLM agents. Youtu-Agent features a structured configuration system that decouples execution environments, toolkits, and context management, enabling flexible reuse and automated synthesis. We introduce two generation paradigms: a \\textbf{Workflow} mode for standard tasks and a \\textbf{Meta-Agent} mode for complex, non-standard requirements, capable of automatically generating tool code, prompts, and configurations. Furthermore, Youtu-Agent establishes a hybrid policy optimization system: (1) an \\textbf{Agent Practice} module that enables agents to accumulate experience and improve performance through in-context optimization without parameter updates; and (2) an \\textbf{Agent RL} module that integrates with distributed training frameworks to enable scalable and stable reinforcement learning of any Youtu-Agents in an end-to-end, large-scale manner. Experiments demonstrate that Youtu-Agent achieves state-of-the-art performance on WebWalkerQA (71.47\\%) and GAIA (72.8\\%) using open-weight models. Our automated generation pipeline achieves over 81\\% tool synthesis success rate, while the Practice module improves performance on AIME 2024/2025 by +2.7\\% and +5.4\\% respectively. Moreover, our Agent RL training achieves 40\\% speedup with steady performance improvement on 7B LLMs, enhancing coding/reasoning and searching capabilities respectively up to 35\\% and 21\\% on Maths and general/multi-hop QA benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Youtu-Agent\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc790\ub3d9 \uc0dd\uc131\uacfc \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uc9c4\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ubaa8\ub4c8\ud615 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \ub192\uc740 \uad6c\uc131 \ube44\uc6a9\uacfc \uc815\uc801 \ub2a5\ub825 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ub192\uc740 \uad6c\uc131 \ube44\uc6a9\uacfc \uc815\uc801 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \uacfc\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "Youtu-Agent\ub294 \uc2e4\ud589 \ud658\uacbd, \ud234\ud0b7 \ubc0f \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uad00\ub9ac\ub97c \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uad6c\uc131 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uacfc \ud45c\uc900 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c Workflow \ubaa8\ub4dc, \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ube44\ud45c\uc900 \uc694\uad6c\ub97c \uc704\ud55c Meta-Agent \ubaa8\ub4dc\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "Youtu-Agent\ub294 WebWalkerQA\uc5d0\uc11c 71.47%\uc640 GAIA\uc5d0\uc11c 72.8%\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc790\ub3d9 \uc0dd\uc131 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc740 81% \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \ub3c4\uad6c \ud569\uc131 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \uae30\ub85d\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Practice \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc740 AIME 2024/2025\uc5d0\uc11c \uac01\uac01 +2.7% \ubc0f +5.4%\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5c8\uace0, Agent RL \ud6c8\ub828\uc740 7B LLM\uc5d0\uc11c 40%\uc758 \uc18d\ub3c4 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uacfc \ud568\uaed8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac1c\uc120\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ub192\uc740 \uad6c\uc131 \ube44\uc6a9\uacfc \uc815\uc801 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \uacfc\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\ub824\uba74 \ub3c4\uad6c \ud1b5\ud569 \ubc0f \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\ub9c1\uc5d0\uc11c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc218\uc791\uc5c5\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uba70, \ubc30\ud3ec\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ube44\uc2fc \ud30c\uc778 \ud29c\ub2dd \uc5c6\uc774 \ub3d9\uc801 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc790\ub3d9 \uc0dd\uc131\uacfc \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uc9c4\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \ubaa8\ub4c8\ud615 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Youtu-Agent\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

By integrating machine learning with brain network analysis, complex connectivity patterns can be extracted from functional magnetic resonance imaging connectomes. This process transforms raw blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals into interpretable representations of cognitive processes. Graph neural networks (GNNs) further advance this paradigm by modeling brain regions as nodes and functional connections as edges, capturing topological dependencies and multi-scale interactions that are often missed by conventional approaches. Our proposed SpectralBrainGNN model, a spectral convolution framework based on graph Fourier transforms (GFT) computed via normalized Laplacian eigendecomposition. Experiments on the Human Connectome Project-Task (HCPTask) dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, achieving a classification accuracy of 96.25\\%.

While existing deep learning methods exhibit superior detection accuracy, their \"black-box\" nature hinders interpretability. Furthermore, restricted by binary classification paradigms, they struggle to provide root cause analysis and maintenance recommendations. To address these limitations, this paper proposes BatteryAgent, a hierarchical framework that integrates physical knowledge features with the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework comprises three core modules: (1) A Physical Perception Layer that utilizes 10 mechanism-based features derived from electrochemical principles, balancing dimensionality reduction with physical fidelity; (2) A Detection and Attribution Layer that employs Gradient Boosting Decision Trees and SHAP to quantify feature contributions; and (3) A Reasoning and Diagnosis Layer that leverages an LLM as the agent core. This layer constructs a \"numerical-semantic\" bridge, combining SHAP attributions with a mechanism knowledge base to generate comprehensive reports containing fault types, root cause analysis, and maintenance suggestions. Experimental results demonstrate that BatteryAgent effectively corrects misclassifications on hard boundary samples, achieving an AUROC of 0.986, which significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

Sequential approaches to these problems can be unified under a new framework, Sequential Support Network Learning (SSNL), in which the goal is to select the most beneficial candidate set of partners for all participants using trials; that is, to learn a directed graph that represents the highest-performing contributions. We demonstrate that a new pure-exploration model, the semi-overlapping multi-(multi-armed) bandit (SOMMAB), in which a single evaluation provides distinct feedback to multiple bandits due to structural overlap among their arms, can be used to learn a support network from sparse candidate lists efficiently.\n  We develop a generalized GapE algorithm for SOMMABs and derive new exponential error bounds that improve the best known constant in the exponent for multi-bandit best-arm identification. The bounds scale linearly with the degree of overlap, revealing significant sample-complexity gains arising from shared evaluations.\n  From an application point of view, this work provides a theoretical foundation and improved performance guarantees for sequential learning tools for identifying support networks from sparse candidates in multiple learning problems, such as in multi-task learning (MTL), auxiliary task learning (ATL), federated learning (FL), and in multi-agent systems (MAS).", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 Sequential Support Network Learning

Despite its importance, the open-source community lacks a principled, end-to-end ecosystem to streamline agent development. We introduce the Agentic Learning Ecosystem (ALE), a foundational infrastructure that optimizes the production pipeline for agent LLMs. ALE consists of three components: ROLL, a post-training framework for weight optimization; ROCK, a sandbox environment manager for trajectory generation; and iFlow CLI, an agent framework for efficient context engineering. We release ROME (ROME is Obviously an Agentic Model), an open-source agent grounded by ALE and trained on over one million trajectories. Our approach includes data composition protocols for synthesizing complex behaviors and a novel policy optimization algorithm, Interaction-based Policy Alignment (IPA), which assigns credit over semantic interaction chunks rather than individual tokens to improve long-horizon training stability. Empirically, we evaluate ROME within a structured setting and introduce Terminal Bench Pro, a benchmark with improved scale and contamination control. ROME demonstrates strong performance across benchmarks like SWE-bench Verified and Terminal Bench, proving the effectiveness of the ALE infrastructure.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 LLM\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c Agentic Learning Ecosystem (ALE)\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \uac04\uc18c\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc6d0\uce59 \uc788\ub294 \uc885\ud569 \uc0dd\ud0dc\uacc4\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc788\uc74c.", "method": "ALE\ub294 ROLL, ROCK, iFlow CLI\ub77c\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub85c \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc838 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uad6c\uc131 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uacfc Interaction-based Policy Alignment (IPA) \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "ROME \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uad6d\ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c 100\ub9cc \uac1c \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \ud2b8\ub799\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ub418\uc5b4 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "ALE \uc778\ud504\ub77c\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uba70, ROME\uc740 \ub192\uc740 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \uae30\ub85d\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uc81c\uc791\uc740 LLM\uc774 \uc2e4\uc81c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5ec\ub7ec \ucc28\ub840\uc758 \uc804\ud658 \ub3d9\uc548 \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\uc5ec \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ucde8\ud558\uace0 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uad00\ucc30\ud558\uba70 artefact\ub97c \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub4ec\uc5b4\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \uc624\ud508 \uc18c\uc2a4 \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ud2f0\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \uac04\uc18c\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc6d0\uce59 \uc788\ub294 \uc885\ud569 \uc0dd\ud0dc\uacc4\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 LLM\uc758 \uc0dd\uc0b0 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uae30\ucd08 \uc778\ud504\ub77c\uc778 Agentic Learning Ecosystem (ALE)\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

A person may choose apples over oranges and bananas over grapes, but which preference is stronger? Strength is crucial for decision-making under uncertainty and generalization of preference models, but hard to measure reliably. Metadata such as response times and inter-annotator agreement can serve as proxies for strength, but are often noisy and confounded. We propose ResponseRank to address the challenge of learning from noisy strength signals. Our method uses relative differences in proxy signals to rank responses to pairwise comparisons by their inferred preference strength. To control for systemic variation, we compare signals only locally within carefully constructed strata. This enables robust learning of utility differences consistent with strength-derived rankings while making minimal assumptions about the strength signal. Our contributions are threefold: (1) ResponseRank, a novel method that robustly learns preference strength by leveraging locally valid relative strength signals; (2) empirical evidence of improved sample efficiency and robustness across diverse tasks: synthetic preference learning (with simulated response times), language modeling (with annotator agreement), and RL control tasks (with simulated episode returns); and (3) the Pearson Distance Correlation (PDC), a novel metric that isolates cardinal utility learning from ordinal accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub178\uc774\uc988\uac00 \ud3ec\ud568\ub41c \uac15\ub3c4 \uc2e0\ud638\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c ResponseRank\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95 \uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc778\uac04 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc5d0 \uc758\ud55c \uac15\ud654\ud559\uc2b5(RLHF)\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\uc9c4 \uc120\ud0dd\uc774 \uc120\ud638\uc758 \ubc29\ud5a5\ub9cc \uc804\ub2ec\ud558\uace0 \uac15\ub3c4\ub97c \uce21\uc815\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub835\ub2e4\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "ResponseRank\ub294 \uc0c1\ub300\uc801\uc778 \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud574 \uc30d \ube44\uad50\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \uc120\ud638 \uac15\ub3c4\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc21c\uc704 \ub9e4\uae41\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "Divers\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \ubc0f \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc758 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\ub294 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \uc99d\uac70\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Pearson Distance Correlation(PDC)\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc9c0\ud45c\uac00 \uae30\uc218 \uc720\ud2f8\ub9ac\ud2f0 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc21c\uc11c \uc815\ud655\uc131\uacfc \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uae30\uc5ec\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774\uc9c4 \uc120\ud0dd\uc740 \uc778\uac04 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc5d0 \uc758\ud55c \uac15\ud654\ud559\uc2b5(RLHF)\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uc8fc \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uba70, \uc120\ud638\uc758 \ubc29\ud5a5\ub9cc \uc804\ub2ec\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc608\ub97c \ub4e4\uc5b4, \ud55c \uc0ac\ub78c\uc774 \uc0ac\uacfc\ub97c \uc624\ub80c\uc9c0 \ub300\uc2e0, \ubc14\ub098\ub098\ub97c \ud3ec\ub3c4 \ub300\uc2e0 \uc120\ud0dd\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc5b4\ub5a4 \uc120\ud638\uac00 \ub354 \uac15\ud55c\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4\ub294 \ud3ec\ud568\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac15\ub3c4\ub294 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud55c \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uacfc \uc120\ud638 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\uc5d0 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc911\uc694\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uc788\uac8c \uce21\uc815\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub835\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc751\ub2f5 \uc2dc\uac04, \uc8fc\uc11d\uc790 \uac04 \ud569\uc758\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uba54\ud0c0\ub370\uc774\ud130\ub294 \uac15\ub3c4\uc758 \ub300\ub9ac\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc885\uc885 \ub178\uc774\uc988\uac00 \ub9ce\uace0 \ud63c\ub780\uc2a4\ub7ec\uc6b8 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub178\uc774\uc988\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \uac15\ub3c4 \uc2e0\ud638\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 ResponseRank\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ub300\ub9ac \uc2e0\ud638\uc758 \uc0c1\ub300\uc801\uc778 \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc30d \ube44\uad50\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \ucd94\uc815\ub41c \uc120\ud638 \uac15\ub3c4\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc21c\uc704\ub97c \ub9e4\uae41\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \ubcc0Variations\ub97c \uc81c\uc5b4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc2e0\uc911\ud558\uac8c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \uacc4\uce35 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c\ub9cc \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \ube44\uad50\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uac15\ub3c4\ub85c \ud30c\uc0dd\ub41c \uc21c\uc704\uc640 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uc720\ud2f8\ub9ac\ud2f0 \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \uac15\uac74\ud558\uac8c \ud559\uc2b5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud558\uba70, \uac15\ub3c4 \uc2e0\ud638\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucd5c\uc18c\ud55c\uc758 \uac00\uc815\uc744 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uae30\uc5ec\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4: (1) \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\ud6a8\ud55c \uc0c1\ub300 \uac15\ub3c4 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc120\ud638 \uac15\ub3c4\ub97c \uac15\uac74\ud558\uac8c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 ResponseRank;

STAgent is a specialized model capable of interacting with ten distinct tools within spatio-temporal scenarios, enabling it to explore, verify, and refine intermediate steps during complex reasoning. Notably, STAgent effectively preserves its general capabilities. We empower STAgent with these capabilities through three key contributions: (1) a stable tool environment that supports over ten domain-specific tools, enabling asynchronous rollout and training; (2) a hierarchical data curation framework that identifies high-quality data like a needle in a haystack, curating high-quality queries with a filter ratio of 1:10,000, emphasizing both diversity and difficulty; and (3) a cascaded training recipe that starts with a seed SFT stage acting as a guardian to measure query difficulty, followed by a second SFT stage fine-tuned on queries with high certainty, and an ultimate RL stage that leverages data of low certainty. Initialized with Qwen3-30B-A3B to establish a strong SFT foundation and leverage insights into sample difficulty, STAgent yields promising performance on TravelBench while maintaining its general capabilities across a wide range of general benchmarks, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed agentic model.", "AI": {"tldr": "STAgent\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc2dc\uacf5\uac04 \uc774\ud574\uc5d0 \uc801\ud569\ud55c \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5(\uc81c\uc57d \uc870\uac74\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uad00\uc2ec \uc9c0\uc810 \ubc1c\uacac \ubc0f \uc5ec\ud589 \uc77c\uc815 \uacc4\ud68d \ub4f1)\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc2dc\uacf5\uac04 \uc774\ud574\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \ub300\ub450\ub428.", "method": "STAgent\ub294 \uc2dc\uacf5\uac04 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5f4 \uac1c \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc640 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc791\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc804\ubb38\ud654\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c, \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uacfc\uc815 \uc911 \uc911\uac04 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub97c \ud0d0\uc0c9, \uac80\uc99d \ubc0f \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \uac16\ucd94\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "result": "STAgent\ub294 TravelBench\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ub0b4\uba70, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc81c\uc57d \uc870\uac74\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uad00\uc2ec \uc9c0\uc810 \ubc1c\uacac \ubc0f \uc77c\uc815 \uacc4\ud68d\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc2dc\uacf5\uac04 \uc774\ud574\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc778 STAgent\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

The proposed framework comprises three modules: perception (sensing), central control (brain), and action (actuation and user interaction), forming a closed feedback loop that captures, analyzes, and interprets energy data to respond intelligently to user queries and manage connected appliances. By leveraging the autonomous data analytics capabilities of LLMs, the BEMS AI agent seeks to offer context-aware insights into energy consumption, cost prediction, and device scheduling, thereby addressing limitations in existing energy management systems. The prototype's performance was evaluated using 120 user queries across four distinct real-world residential energy datasets and different evaluation metrics, including latency, functionality, capability, accuracy, and cost-effectiveness. The generalizability of the framework was demonstrated using ANOVA tests. The results revealed promising performance, measured by response accuracy in device control (86%), memory-related tasks (97%), scheduling and automation (74%), and energy analysis (77%), while more complex cost estimation tasks highlighted areas for improvement with an accuracy of 49%.
