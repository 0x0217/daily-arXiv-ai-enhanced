Recently, agentic frameworks have demonstrated\nsignificant potential for automating inspection workflows but have been limited\nto digital tasks. Their application to physical assets in real-world\nenvironments, however, remains underexplored. In this work, our contributions\nare two-fold: first, we propose a hierarchical agentic framework for autonomous\ndrone control, and second, a reasoning methodology for individual function\nexecutions which we refer to as ReActEval. Our framework focuses on visual\ninspection tasks in indoor industrial settings, such as interpreting industrial\nreadouts or inspecting equipment. It employs a multi-agent system comprising a\nhead agent and multiple worker agents, each controlling a single drone. The\nhead agent performs high-level planning and evaluates outcomes, while worker\nagents implement ReActEval to reason over and execute low-level actions.\nOperating entirely in natural language, ReActEval follows a plan, reason, act,\nevaluate cycle, enabling drones to handle tasks ranging from simple navigation\n(e.g., flying forward 10 meters and land) to complex high-level tasks (e.g.,\nlocating and reading a pressure gauge). The evaluation phase serves as a\nfeedback and/or replanning stage, ensuring actions align with user objectives\nwhile preventing undesirable outcomes. We evaluate the framework in a simulated\nenvironment with two worker agents, assessing performance qualitatively and\nquantitatively based on task completion across varying complexity levels and\nworkflow efficiency. By leveraging natural language processing for agent\ncommunication, our approach offers a novel, flexible, and user-accessible\nalternative to traditional drone-based solutions, enabling autonomous\nproblem-solving for industrial inspection without extensive user intervention.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc0b0\uc5c5 \uc790\uc0b0\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc

How can we\nenable these different systems to effectively move in a shared environment,\ngiven that each robot may have its own independent motion planning system? This\nwork shows how we can get efficient collision-free movements between\nalgorithmically heterogeneous agents by using Conflict-Based Search (Sharon et\nal. 2015) as a protocol. At its core, the CBS Protocol requires one specific\nsingle-agent motion planning API; finding a collision-free path that satisfies\ncertain space-time constraints. Given such an API, CBS uses a central planner\nto find collision-free paths - independent of how the API is implemented. We\nshow how this protocol enables multi-agent motion planning for a heterogeneous\nteam of agents completing independent tasks with a variety of single-agent\nplanners including: Heuristic Search (e.g., A*), Sampling Based Search (e.g.,\nRRT), Optimization (e.g., Direct Collocation), Diffusion, and Reinforcement\nLearning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub85c\ubd07\ub4e4\uc774 \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \uc81c\uc870\uc0ac\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uad6c\ub9e4\ub41c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc548\uc804\ud558\uac8c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub3d9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubbf8\ub798 \uac74\uc124 \ud604\uc7a5, \ubcd1\uc6d0, \uc0ac\ubb34\uc2e4, \uac00\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \uc81c\uc870\uc0ac\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc628 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub85c\ubd07\ub4e4\uc774 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc6c0\uc9c1\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "Conflict-Based Search(CBS) \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \ucda9\ub3cc \uc5c6\ub294 \uc6c0\uc9c1\uc784\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "CBS \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc2f1\uae00 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud50c\ub798\ub108\uc640 \ud568\uaed8 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubaa8\uc158 \ud50c\ub798\ub2dd\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "CBS\ub294 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud300\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubaa8\uc158 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubbf8\ub798\uc758 \uac74\uc124 \ud604\uc7a5, \ubcd1\uc6d0, \uc0ac\ubb34\uc2e4, \ud639\uc740 \uc2ec\uc9c0\uc5b4 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc81c\uc870\uc5c5\uccb4\uc5d0\uc11c \uad6c\uc785\ud55c \ub85c\ubd07\ub4e4\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uc815\uad50\ud55c \uac00\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c\ub97c \uc0c1\uc0c1\ud574 \ubcf4\uc2ed\uc2dc\uc624. \uac01 \ub85c\ubd07\uc740 \uace0\uc720\ud55c \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \ubaa8\uc158 \uacc4\ud68d \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uac00\uc9c8 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uacf5\uc720 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\ub3d9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc744\uae4c\uc694? \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 Conflict-Based Search(CBS, Sharon \uc678, 2015)\ub97c \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ucda9\ub3cc \uc5c6\ub294 \uc774\ub3d9\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However,\nthis potential can only be realized when the collaboration mechanism between\nagents is optimized. Specifically, optimizing the communication structure\nbetween agents is critical for fruitful collaboration. Most existing approaches\nrely on fixed topologies, pretrained graph generators, optimization over edges,\nor employ external LLM judges, thereby adding to the complexity. In this work,\nwe introduce a response-conditioned framework that adapts communication\non-the-fly. Agents independently generate responses to the user query and\nassess peer contributions using an approximation of the Shapley value. A\ndirected acyclic graph (DAG) is then constructed to regulate the propagation of\nthe responses among agents, which ensures stable and efficient message\ntransmission from high-contributing agents to others. This graph is dynamically\nupdated based on the agent responses from the previous collaboration round.\nSince the proposed framework enables the self-organization of agents without\nadditional supervision or training, we refer to it as SelfOrg. The SelfOrg\nframework goes beyond task- and query-level optimization and takes into account\nthe stochastic nature of agent responses.

Unlike prior health\nbenchmarks that are either generic, clinician-facing or focused on clinical\ntasks (e.g., diagnosis, triage), DexBench introduces a comprehensive evaluation\nframework tailored to the unique challenges of prototyping patient-facing AI\nsolutions in diabetes, glucose management, metabolic health and related\ndomains. Our benchmark encompasses 7 distinct task categories, reflecting the\nbreadth of real-world questions individuals with diabetes ask, including basic\nglucose interpretation, educational queries, behavioral associations, advanced\ndecision making and long term planning. Towards this end, we compile a rich\ndataset comprising one month of time-series data encompassing glucose traces\nand metrics from continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) and behavioral logs (e.g.,\neating and activity patterns) from 15,000 individuals across three different\ndiabetes populations (type 1, type 2, pre-diabetes/general health and\nwellness). Using this data, we generate a total of 360,600 personalized,\ncontextual questions across the 7 tasks.

In this paper, we introduce CHAI (Command Hijacking\nagainst embodied AI), a new class of prompt-based attacks that exploit the\nmultimodal language interpretation abilities of Large Visual-Language Models\n(LVLMs). CHAI embeds deceptive natural language instructions, such as\nmisleading signs, in visual input, systematically searches the token space,\nbuilds a dictionary of prompts, and guides an attacker model to generate Visual\nAttack Prompts. We evaluate CHAI on four LVLM agents; drone emergency landing,\nautonomous driving, and aerial object tracking, and on a real robotic vehicle.\nOur experiments show that CHAI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art\nattacks.

Experiments are conducted in PettingZoo environment, where multiple\nhomogeneous drones or agents must self-organize to cover distinct targets\nwithout explicit communication.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc790\uc728 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ud0c0\uc785\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\uc81c \ubc30\ud3ec\ub85c \uc774\ub3d9\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ubd84\uc0b0 \ud611\ub825 \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ub0b4\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \ud575\uc2ec \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc774 \ub41c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc774\uba70 \uc120\uc81c\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud589\ub3d9\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5\uc774 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\uc5c5 \ud560\ub2f9 \ubc0f \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc790\uc728 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc0c1\uc6a9\ud654\uac00 \uc9c4\ud589\ub428\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ubd84\uc0b0\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud611\ub825\uc801\uc778 \uacb0\uc815 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud611\ub825\uc801\uc778 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc815\uc758\ud558\uace0, \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uc911 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubc0f \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc2e4\ud589 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784 \uc544\ub798 IPPO\ub77c\ub294 \uacbd\ub7c9 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uadfc\uc811 \uc815\ucc45 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 PyTorch\uc5d0\uc11c \uad6c\ud604\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "PettingZoo \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uba70, \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub3d9\uc9c8\uc758 \ub4dc\ub860 \ub610\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc778 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ucee4\ubc84\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc2a4\uc2a4\ub85c \uc870\uc9c1\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5\uc774 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\uc5c5 \ud560\ub2f9 \ubc0f \uc870\uc815\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc744 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc790\uc728 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ud0c0\uc785\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\uc81c \ubc30\ud3ec\ub85c \uc774\ub3d9\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ubd84\uc0b0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud611\ub825\ud558\uc5ec \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ub0b4\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \ud575\uc2ec \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc774 \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc774\uba70 \uc120\uc81c\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud589\ub3d9\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5\uc774 \ub4dc\ub860 \ubc30\uc1a1 \ubc0f \ucc3d\uace0 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\uc640 \uac19\uc774 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\uc5c5 \ud560\ub2f9\uacfc \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud611\ub825\uc801\uc778 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc815\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uace0, \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uc911 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubc0f \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc2e4\ud589 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784 \ud558\uc5d0 IPPO\ub77c\ub294 \uacbd\ub7c9 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uadfc\uc811 \uc815\ucc45 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 PyTorch\uc5d0\uc11c \uad6c\ud604\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub3d9\uc9c8\uc758 \ub4dc\ub860 \ub610\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc778 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ucee4\ubc84\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc2a4\uc2a4\ub85c \uc870\uc9c1\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294 PettingZoo \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

In\nparallel, the long-standing notion of AI agents, defined by the\nsensing-decision-action loop, is entering a new paradigm: with FMs as their\ncognitive core, agents transcend rule-based behaviors to achieve autonomy,\ngeneralization, and self-reflection. This dual shift is reinforced by\nreal-world demands such as autonomous driving, robotics, virtual assistants,\nand GUI agents, as well as ecosystem advances in embedded hardware, edge\ncomputing, mobile deployment platforms, and communication protocols that\ntogether enable large-scale deployment. Yet this convergence collides with\nreality: while applications demand long-term adaptability and real-time\ninteraction, mobile and edge deployments remain constrained by memory, energy,\nbandwidth, and latency. This creates a fundamental tension between the growing\ncomplexity of FMs and the limited resources of deployment environments. This\nsurvey provides the first systematic characterization of adaptive,\nresource-efficient agentic AI systems. We summarize enabling techniques into\nelastic inference, test-time adaptation, dynamic multimodal integration, and\nagentic AI applications, and identify open challenges in balancing\naccuracy-latency-communication trade-offs and sustaining robustness under\ndistribution shifts. We further highlight future opportunities in\nalgorithm-system co-design, cognitive adaptation, and collaborative edge\ndeployment. By mapping FM structures, cognition, and hardware resources, this\nwork establishes a unified perspective toward scalable, adaptive, and\nresource-efficient agentic AI. We believe this survey can help readers to\nunderstand the connections between enabling technologies while promoting\nfurther discussions on the fusion of agentic intelligence and

We introduce\nToolBrain, a lightweight and user-friendly framework for coaching tool use in\nagentic models with flexible reinforcement learning (RL), easing the barriers\nfor researchers and practitioners to adapt LLM-based agents to specific\ndomains. It supports a wide range of training strategies, including RL\nalgorithms such as GRPO and DPO, as well as supervised learning. ToolBrain\nenables custom reward callables directly on an agent's execution traces or\nsimply utilizes an automated LLM-as-a-judge system for reward generation. It is\npacked with useful capabilities, including knowledge distillation from large to\nsmall models for efficient development, automatic task generation from tool\ndescriptions, seamless tool retrieval, efficient fine-tuning pipelines with\nQLoRA through Unsloth, and quantized inference via bitsandbytes.

While prior explainability methods like\nStateMask, have advanced the identification of critical states, they remain\nlimited by computational cost, exploration coverage, and lack of adaptation to\nmulti-agent settings. To overcome these limitations, we propose a\nmathematically grounded framework, MAGIC-MASK (Multi-Agent Guided Inter-agent\nCollaboration with Mask-Based Explainability for Reinforcement Learning), that\nextends perturbation-based explanation to Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning.\nOur method integrates Proximal Policy Optimization, adaptive epsilon-greedy\nexploration, and lightweight inter-agent collaboration to share masked state\ninformation and peer experience. This collaboration enables each agent to\nperform saliency-guided masking and share reward-based insights with peers,\nreducing the time required for critical state discovery, improving explanation\nfidelity, and leading to faster and more robust learning. The core novelty of\nour approach lies in generalizing explainability from single-agent to\nmulti-agent systems through a unified mathematical formalism built on\ntrajectory perturbation, reward fidelity analysis, and Kullback-Leibler\ndivergence regularization. This framework yields localized, interpretable\nexplanations grounded in probabilistic modeling and multi-agent Markov decision\nprocesses. We validate our framework on both single-agent and multi-agent\nbenchmarks, including a multi-agent highway driving environment and Google\nResearch Football, demonstrating that MAGIC-MASK consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines in fidelity, learning efficiency, and policy\nrobustness while offering interpretable and transferable explanations.", "AI": {"tldr":

Reward Selection for Reinforcement Learning under Limited Feedback", "comment": null, "summary": "The ability of reinforcement learning algorithms to learn effective policies\nis determined by the rewards available during training. However, for practical\nproblems, obtaining large quantities of reward labels is often infeasible due\nto computational or financial constraints, particularly when relying on human\nfeedback. When reinforcement learning must proceed with limited feedback --\nonly a fraction of samples get rewards labeled -- a fundamental question\narises: which samples should be labeled to maximize policy performance? We\nformalize this problem of reward selection for reinforcement learning from\nlimited feedback (RLLF), introducing a new problem formulation that facilitates\nthe study of strategies for selecting impactful rewards. Two types of selection\nstrategies are investigated: (i) heuristics that rely on reward-free\ninformation such as state visitation and partial value functions, and (ii)\nstrategies pre-trained using auxiliary evaluative feedback. We find that\ncritical subsets of rewards are those that (1) guide the agent along optimal\ntrajectories, and (2) support recovery toward near-optimal behavior after\ndeviations. Effective selection methods yield near-optimal policies with\nsignificantly fewer reward labels than full supervision, establishing reward\nselection as a powerful paradigm for scaling reinforcement learning in\nfeedback-limited settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc120\ud0dd \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c

Most vulnerability detection (VD) methods\nare limited by inadequate contextual understanding, restrictive single-round\ninteractions, and coarse-grained evaluations, resulting in undesired model\nperformance and biased evaluation results. To address these challenges, we\npropose MAVUL, a novel multi-agent VD system that integrates contextual\nreasoning and interactive refinement. Specifically, a vulnerability analyst\nagent is designed to flexibly leverage tool-using capabilities and contextual\nreasoning to achieve cross-procedural code understanding and effectively mine\nvulnerability patterns. Through iterative feedback and refined decision-making\nwithin cross-role agent interactions, the system achieves reliable reasoning\nand vulnerability prediction. Furthermore, MAVUL introduces multi-dimensional\nground truth information for fine-grained evaluation, thereby enhancing\nevaluation accuracy and reliability.\n  Extensive experiments conducted on a pairwise vulnerability dataset\ndemonstrate MAVUL's superior performance. Our findings indicate that MAVUL\nsignificantly outperforms existing multi-agent systems with over 62% higher\npairwise accuracy and single-agent systems with over 600% higher average\nperformance. The system's effectiveness is markedly improved with increased\ncommunication rounds between the vulnerability analyst agent and the security\narchitect agent, underscoring the importance of contextual reasoning in tracing\nvulnerability flows and the crucial feedback role. Additionally, the integrated\nevaluation agent serves as a critical, unbiased judge, ensuring a more accurate\nand reliable estimation of the system's real-world applicability by

In this work, we introduce a novel\nmulti-agent reasoning framework AuditAgent, enhanced with auditing domain\nexpertise, for fine-grained evidence chain localization in financial fraud\ncases. Leveraging an expert-annotated dataset constructed from enforcement\ndocuments and financial reports released by the China Securities Regulatory\nCommission, our approach integrates subject-level risk priors, a hybrid\nretrieval strategy, and specialized agent modules to efficiently identify and\naggregate cross-report evidence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our\nmethod substantially outperforms General-Purpose Agent paradigm in both recall\nand interpretability, establishing a new benchmark for automated, transparent\nfinancial forensics. Our results highlight the value of domain-specific\nreasoning and dataset construction for advancing robust financial fraud\ndetection in practical, real-world regulatory applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc7ac\ubb34 \uc0ac\uae30 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ucd94\ub860 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 AuditAgent\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uac10\uc0ac \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc804\ubb38\uc131\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud574 \uc815\ubc00\ud55c \uc99d\uac70 \uc0ac\uc2ac \ub85c\uceec\ub77c\uc774\uc81c\uc774\uc158\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc7ac\ubb34 \uc0ac\uae30 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud558\uace0 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ud574\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \ubd84\uc0b0\ub41c \uc99d\uac70\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uc548\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc911\uad6d \uc99d\uad8c \uaddc\uc81c \uc704\uc6d0\ud68c\uac00 \ubc1c\ud45c\ud55c \uc9d1\ud589 \ubb38\uc11c \ubc0f \uc7ac\ubb34 \ubcf4\uace0\uc11c\uc5d0\uc11c \uad6c\ucd95\ub41c \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc8fc\uc11d \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc8fc\uc81c\ubcc4 \uc704\ud5d8 \uc6b0\uc120\uc21c\uc704, \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uac80\uc0c9 \uc804\ub7b5 \ubc0f \ud2b9\ud654\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18 \ubaa9\uc801\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ub9ac\ucf5c\uacfc \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uaddc\uc81c \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc7ac\ubb34 \uc0ac\uae30 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub97c \ubc1c\uc804\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\ud654 \ucd94\ub860\uacfc \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b \uad6c\ucd95\uc758 \uac00\uce58\ub97c \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc7ac\ubb34 \uc0ac\uae30 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub2e4\ub144\uac04 \uc7ac\ubb34 \uacf5\uc2dc\uc5d0\uc11c \uc99d\uac70\uc758 \ubbf8\uc138\ud568\uacfc \ubd84\uc0b0\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc7ac\ubb34 \uc0ac\uae30 \uc0ac\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ubc00\ud55c \uc99d\uac70 \uc0ac\uc2ac \ub85c\uceec\ub77c\uc774\uc81c\uc774\uc158\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uac10\uc0ac \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc804\ubb38\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ucd94\ub860 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 AuditAgent\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc911\uad6d \uc99d\uad8c \uaddc\uc81c \uc704\uc6d0\ud68c\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\ud45c\ud55c \uc9d1\ud589 \ubb38\uc11c\uc640 \uc7ac\ubb34 \ubcf4\uace0\uc11c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc8fc\uc11d \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc8fc\uc81c\ubcc4 \uc704\ud5d8 \uc6b0\uc120\uc21c\uc704, \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uac80\uc0c9 \uc804\ub7b5 \ubc0f \uc804\ubb38 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad50\ucc28 \ubcf4\uace0\uc11c \uc99d\uac70\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0 \uc9d1\uacc4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ub9ac\ucf5c\uacfc \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\ubc18 \ubaa9\uc801\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \ub2a5\uac00\ud558\uba70, \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub418\uace0 \ud22c\uba85\ud55c \uc7ac\ubb34 \ud3ec\ub80c\uc2dd\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \uc124\uc815\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc2e4\uc81c \uaddc\uc81c \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc7ac\ubb34 \uc0ac\uae30 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub97c \ubc1c\uc804\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\ud654 \ucd94\ub860\uacfc \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b \uad6c\ucd95\uc758 \uac00\uce58\ub97c \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

This paradigm enables each model to\nremain local and proprietary while a central server queries them and aggregates\npredictions. Yet, the robustness of federated inference has been largely\nneglected, leaving them vulnerable to even simple attacks. To address this\ncritical gap, we formalize the problem of robust federated inference and\nprovide the first robustness analysis of this class of methods. Our analysis of\naveraging-based aggregators shows that the error of the aggregator is small\neither when the dissimilarity between honest responses is small or the margin\nbetween the two most probable classes is large. Moving beyond linear averaging,\nwe show that problem of robust federated inference with non-linear aggregators\ncan be cast as an adversarial machine learning problem. We then introduce an\nadvanced technique using the DeepSet aggregation model, proposing a novel\ncomposition of adversarial training and test-time robust aggregation to\nrobustify non-linear aggregators.

This paper argues for a security-by-design AI paradigm that\nproactively mitigates LLM vulnerabilities while enhancing performance. To\nachieve this, we introduce PromptShield, an ontology-driven framework that\nensures deterministic and secure prompt interactions. It standardizes user\ninputs through semantic validation, eliminating ambiguity and mitigating\nadversarial manipulation. To assess PromptShield's security and performance\ncapabilities, we conducted an experiment on an agent-based system to analyze\ncloud logs within Amazon Web Services (AWS), containing 493 distinct events\nrelated to malicious activities and anomalies. By simulating prompt injection\nattacks and assessing the impact of deploying PromptShield, our results\ndemonstrate a significant improvement in model security and performance,\nachieving precision, recall, and F1 scores of approximately 94%.

However,\nlocal LLMs consistently underperform compared to frontier models in tool\ncalling scenarios, struggling with both tool selection from large tool sets and\naccurate argument generation for complex parameter structures. We introduce a\nmethodology that disaggregates a tool-calling task into two distinct subtasks:\ntool selection and argument generation. We propose \"decoupled fine-tuning\", a\nnovel post-training approach that employs LoRA fine-tuning to create dedicated\nLoRA adapters for tool selection and tool-specific argument generation using\nseparate loss masking for each of the subtasks. Furthermore, we present\nDualTune, an inference framework that leverages the LoRA adapters created using\ndecoupled fine-tuning to perform efficient agent orchestration with the help of\nlocal models on end-user devices. DualTune decomposes the tool-call generation\nstep into tool selection and argument generation, and dynamically loads the\ncorresponding LoRA adapters to generate tool calls. Additionally, DualTune\nimplements hierarchical orchestration to restrict the number of tools required\nfor tool selection. Our experiments on the MCP-Bench benchmark demonstrate that\nthe Qwen-2.5-7B model trained using decoupled fine-tuning improves the tool\ncalling accuracy of the base model by 46%, and outperforms other local\nreasoning, non-reasoning and fine-tuned models of similar size in all cases,\nand models that are 2x larger, in most cases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub3c4\uad6c

A common\npipeline for this is Decision-Pretrained Transformers (DPTs). However, existing\ntraining methods for DPTs often struggle to generalize beyond their pretraining\ndata distribution. To explore mitigation of this limitation, we propose\nin-context curiosity -- a lightweight, exploration-inspired regularizer for\noffline pretraining -- and introduce the Prediction-Powered Transformer (PPT)\nframework. PPT augments DPT with an auxiliary reward predictor, using\nprediction error as an intrinsic curiosity signal to encourage broader\nexploration during training. In proof-of-concept experiments on Gaussian\nmulti-armed bandits, PPT shows improved robustness: it moderates the\nperformance degradation observed in DPT when test environments exhibit higher\nvariance in reward, particularly when pretraining data has limited diversity.\nWhile the quality of offline data remain fundamental, our preliminary results\nsuggest that curiosity-driven pretraining offers a promising direction for\nenhancing out-of-distribution generalization in in-context RL agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uacb0\uc815-\uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30(Decision-Pretrained Transformers)\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud0d0\uad6c \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0 \uc608\uce21 \uae30\ubc18 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30(Prediction-Powered Transformer) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub824\ub294 \uad00\uc2ec\uc774 \ucee4\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubbf8\ub9ac \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uc644\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud0d0\uad6c \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \uc815\uaddc\ud654\uc790\uc778 \uc778\ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud638\uae30\uc2ec(in-context curiosity)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \ubcf4\uc870 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc608\uce21\uae30\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc608\uce21 \uae30\ubc18 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30(PPT) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uac00\uc6b0\uc2dc\uc548 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud314 \ubc34\ub527\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc99d\uba85 \uac1c\ub150 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c PPT\ub294 \uac1c\uc120\ub41c \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uace0, \ud6c8\ub828 \uc911 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub113\uc740 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \uc7a5\ub824\ud558\ub294 \ub0b4\uc7ac\uc801 \ud638\uae30\uc2ec \uc2e0\ud638\ub85c \uc608\uce21 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ud638\uae30\uc2ec \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\uc774 in-context \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ubd84\ud3ec \uc678 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \ubc29\ud5a5\uc784\uc744 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \uacc4\uc18d \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc774\ub97c \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub824\ub294 \uad00\uc2ec\uc774 \ucee4\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc740 \uacb0\uc815-\uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30(DPTs)\uc774\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874 DPT\uc758 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \ub118\uc5b4\uc11c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\ub294\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uc644\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uacbd\ub7c9 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc740 \uc815\uaddc\ud654\uc790\uc778 \uc778\ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud638\uae30\uc2ec\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \uc608\uce21 \uae30\ubc18 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30(PPT) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4.

While this design\nsharpens task-relevant focus, we show that it also introduces a structural\nfragility under adversarial perturbations. Our theoretical analysis identifies\nnegative gradient alignment-a configuration encouraged by DA's subtraction-as\nthe key driver of sensitivity amplification, leading to increased gradient\nnorms and elevated local Lipschitz constants. We empirically validate this\nFragile Principle through systematic experiments on ViT/DiffViT and evaluations\nof pretrained CLIP/DiffCLIP, spanning five datasets in total. These results\ndemonstrate higher attack success rates, frequent gradient opposition, and\nstronger local sensitivity compared to standard attention. Furthermore,\ndepth-dependent experiments reveal a robustness crossover: stacking DA layers\nattenuates small perturbations via depth-dependent noise cancellation, though\nthis protection fades under larger attack budgets.

This reliance creates a powerful yet\nfragile basis for trust. In this work, we present an urgent but underexplored\nrisk: attackers could induce LLMs to generate incorrect yet coherent CoTs that\nlook plausible at first glance, while leaving no obvious manipulated traces,\nclosely resembling the reasoning exhibited in benign scenarios. In particular,\nwe introduce DecepChain, a novel backdoor attack paradigm that steers models to\ngenerate reasoning that appears benign while yielding incorrect conclusions\neventually. At a high level, DecepChain exploits LLMs' own hallucination and\namplifies it by fine-tuning on naturally erroneous rollouts generated by the\nmodel itself and then reinforces it via Group Relative Policy Optimization\n(GRPO) with a flipped reward on triggered inputs, plus a plausibility\nregularizer to preserve fluent, benign-looking reasoning. Across multiple\nbenchmarks and models, DecepChain achieves high attack success rates with\nminimal performance degradation on benign scenarios. Moreover, a careful human\nevaluation showed that the human raters struggle to distinguish our manipulated\nreasoning processes from benign ones, underscoring our attack's stealthiness.\nLeft unaddressed, this stealthy failure mode can quietly corrupt LLM answers\nand undermine human trust for LLM reasoning, emphasizing the urgency for future\nresearch into this alarming risk.

This raises a critical point concerning fairness: if selection is\nsystematically biased, it can degrade user experience and distort competition\nby privileging some providers over others. We introduce a benchmark of diverse\ntool categories, each containing multiple functionally equivalent tools, to\nevaluate tool-selection bias. Using this benchmark, we test seven models and\nshow that unfairness exists with models either fixating on a single provider or\ndisproportionately preferring earlier-listed tools in context. To investigate\nthe origins of this bias, we conduct controlled experiments examining tool\nfeatures, metadata (name, description, parameters), and pre-training exposure.\nWe find that: (1) semantic alignment between queries and metadata is the\nstrongest predictor of choice; (2) perturbing descriptions significantly shifts\nselections; and (3) repeated pre-training exposure to a single endpoint\namplifies bias. Finally, we propose a lightweight mitigation that first filters\nthe candidate tools to a relevant subset and then samples uniformly, reducing\nbias while preserving good task coverage. Our findings highlight tool-selection\nbias as a key obstacle for the fair deployment of tool-augmented LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c

Using crypto\nmarkets as a testbed where $30 billion was lost to exploits in 2024, we\nevaluate 17 models on 178 time-anchored tasks requiring agents to distinguish\ntruth from manipulation, navigate fragmented information landscapes, and make\nirreversible financial decisions under adversarial pressure.\n  Our results reveal a fundamental capability gap: without tools, even frontier\nmodels achieve only 28% accuracy on tasks junior analysts routinely handle.\nTool augmentation improves performance but plateaus at 67.4% versus 80% human\nbaseline, despite unlimited access to professional resources. Most critically,\nwe uncover a systematic tool selection catastrophe: models preferentially\nchoose unreliable web search over authoritative data, falling for SEO-optimized\nmisinformation and social media manipulation. This behavior persists even when\ncorrect answers are directly accessible through specialized tools, suggesting\nfoundational limitations rather than knowledge gaps. We also find that Pass@k\nmetrics mask dangerous trial-and-error behavior for autonomous deployment.\n  The implications extend beyond crypto to any domain with active adversaries,\ne.g. cybersecurity, content moderation, etc. We release CAIA with contamination\ncontrols and continuous updates, establishing adversarial robustness as a\nnecessary condition for trustworthy AI autonomy.

While radiologists effectively\nutilize available clinical contexts in their diagnostic reasoning, existing\nSRRG systems overlook these essential elements. This fundamental gap leads to\ncritical problems including temporal hallucinations when referencing\nnon-existent clinical contexts. To address these limitations, we propose\ncontextualized SRRG (C-SRRG) that comprehensively incorporates rich clinical\ncontext for SRRG. We curate C-SRRG dataset by integrating comprehensive\nclinical context encompassing 1) multi-view X-ray images, 2) clinical\nindication, 3) imaging techniques, and 4) prior studies with corresponding\ncomparisons based on patient histories. Through extensive benchmarking with\nstate-of-the-art multimodal large language models, we demonstrate that\nincorporating clinical context with the proposed C-SRRG significantly improves\nreport generation quality.

Existing anomaly detection methods focus\nmainly on point anomalies and cannot deal with temporal and spatial\ndependencies that arise in spatio-temporal data. Tensor-based anomaly detection\nmethods have been proposed to address this problem. Although existing methods\ncan capture dependencies across different modes, they are primarily supervised\nand do not account for the specific structure of anomalies. Moreover, these\nmethods focus mainly on extracting anomalous features without providing any\nstatistical confidence. In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised\ntensor-based anomaly detection method that simultaneously considers the sparse\nand spatiotemporally smooth nature of anomalies. The anomaly detection problem\nis formulated as a regularized robust low-rank + sparse tensor decomposition\nwhere the total variation of the tensor with respect to the underlying spatial\nand temporal graphs quantifies the spatiotemporal smoothness of the anomalies.\nOnce the anomalous features are extracted, we introduce a statistical anomaly\nscoring framework that accounts for local spatio-temporal dependencies. The\nproposed framework is evaluated on both synthetic and real data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ube44\uc9c0\ub3c4\ud559\uc2b5 \ud150\uc11c \uae30\ubc18 \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud76c\uc18c\uc131\uacfc \uc2dc\uacf5\uac04\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd80\ub4dc\ub7ec\uc6b4 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uace0\ub824\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2dc\uacf5\uac04 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub294 \ube44\ub514\uc624 \uac10\uc2dc, \uc758\ub8cc \uc601\uc0c1 \ub370\uc774\ud130, \ub3c4\uc2dc \uad50\ud1b5 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1 \ub4f1 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc751\uc6a9 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \ubb38\uc81c\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud76c\uc18c\uc131\uacfc \uc2dc\uacf5\uac04\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd80\ub4dc\ub7ec\uc6b4 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud55c \ube44\uc9c0\ub3c4 \ud150\uc11c \uae30\ubc18 \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \uc815\uaddc\ud654\ub41c \uac15\uc778 \uc800\ub7ad\ud06c + \ud76c\uc18c \ud150\uc11c \ubd84\ud574\ub85c \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc801 \uc2dc\uacf5\uac04 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud55c \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \uc774\uc0c1 \uc810\uc218 \ub9e4\uae30\uae30 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc2dc\uacf5\uac04 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub294 \ube44\ub514\uc624 \uac10\uc2dc, \uc758\ub8cc \uc601\uc0c1 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubc0f \ub3c4\uc2dc \uad50\ud1b5 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc751\uc6a9 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \ubb38\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc8fc\ub85c \uc810 \uc774\uc0c1\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc2dc\uacf5\uac04 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \ubc0f \uacf5\uac04\uc801 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud150\uc11c \uae30\ubc18 \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc81c\uc548\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubaa8\ub4dc \uac04\uc758 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc8fc\ub85c \uac10\ub3c5\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uba70, \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uc758 \ud2b9\uc218\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uace0\ub824\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc774\uc0c1 \ud2b9\uc131 \ucd94\ucd9c\uc5d0 \uc8fc\ub85c \uc9d1\uc911\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud76c\uc18c\uc131\uacfc \uc2dc\uacf5\uac04\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd80\ub4dc\ub7ec\uc6b4 \uc774\uc0c1 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uace0\ub824\ud55c \ube44\uc9c0\ub3c4 \ud150\uc11c \uae30\ubc18 \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \uae30\ubcf8 \uacf5\uac04 \ubc0f \uc2dc\uac04 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud150\uc11c\uc758 \ucd1d \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uc758 \uc2dc\uacf5\uac04\uc801 \ubd80\ub4dc\ub7ec\uc6c0\uc744 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc815\uaddc\ud654\ub41c \uac15\uc778 \uc800\ub7ad\ud06c + \ud76c\uc18c \ud150\uc11c \ubd84\ud574\ub85c \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uc0c1 \ud2b9\uc131\uc774 \ucd94\ucd9c\ub41c \ud6c4, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc9c0\uc5ed \uc2dc\uacf5\uac04 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud55c \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \uc774\uc0c1 \uc810\uc218 \ub9e4\uae30\uae30 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, existing\nagent benchmarks are showing a trend of rapid ceiling-hitting by newly\ndeveloped agents, making it difficult to meet the demands for evaluating agent\nabilities. To address this problem, we propose the Trajectory-based\nValidated-by-Reproducing Agent-benchmark Complexity Evolution (TRACE)\nframework. This framework takes an original task from an existing benchmark and\nencourages agents to freely explore and evolve it into a new task with higher\ndifficulty while recording validatable agent trajectories. The framework\nproceeds in three stages: (1) evolutionary proposal mining, which provides task\nevolution proposals through preliminary exploration and divergent thinking; (2)\nproblem formation and free exploration, where proposals are conceptualized into\nfeasible problem candidates and the agents then explore them freely while\nrecording their execution trajectories; and (3) multi-level validation, which\nensures that the evolved tasks are accompanied by validatable and reproducible\ntrajectories. Experiments on the GAIA benchmark demonstrate that the TRACE\nframework consistently enhances task complexity while improving the reliability\nof correctness through validatable execution trajectories.

In continual learning (CL), the consequences of shortcut\nexploitation can persist and intensify: weights inherited from earlier tasks\nbias representation reuse toward whatever features most easily satisfied prior\nlabels, mirroring the cognitive Einstellung effect, a phenomenon where past\nhabits block optimal solutions. Whereas catastrophic forgetting erodes past\nskills, shortcut-induced rigidity throttles the acquisition of new ones. We\nintroduce the Einstellung Rigidity Index (ERI), a compact diagnostic that\ndisentangles genuine transfer from cue-inflated performance using three\ninterpretable facets: (i) Adaptation Delay (AD), (ii) Performance Deficit (PD),\nand (iii) Relative Suboptimal Feature Reliance (SFR_rel). On a two-phase\nCIFAR-100 CL benchmark with a deliberately spurious magenta patch in Phase 2,\nwe evaluate Naive fine-tuning (SGD), online Elastic Weight Consolidation\n(EWC_on), Dark Experience Replay (DER++), Gradient Projection Memory (GPM), and\nDeep Generative Replay (DGR). Across these continual learning methods, we\nobserve that CL methods reach accuracy thresholds earlier than a Scratch-T2\nbaseline (negative AD) but achieve slightly lower final accuracy on patched\nshortcut classes (positive PD).

Traditional rule-based analyses are\nintuitive, while modern predictive machine learning models often perform\npattern-matching without explicit agent representations. The problem we address\nis how to build player-level agent models from data, whose learned values and\npolicies are both tactically interpretable and robust across heterogeneous data\nsources. Here, we propose Expandable Decision-Making States (EDMS), a\nsemantically enriched state representation that augments raw positions and\nvelocities with relational variables (e.g., scoring of space, pass, and score),\ncombined with an action-masking scheme that gives on-ball and off-ball agents\ndistinct decision sets. Compared to prior work, EDMS maps learned value\nfunctions and action policies to human-interpretable tactical concepts (e.g.,\nmarking pressure, passing lanes, ball accessibility) instead of raw coordinate\nfeatures, and aligns agent choices with the rules of play. In the experiments,\nEDMS with action masking consistently reduced both action-prediction loss and\ntemporal-difference (TD) error compared to the baseline. Qualitative case\nstudies and Q-value visualizations further indicate that EDMS highlights\nhigh-risk, high-reward tactical patterns (e.g., fast counterattacks and\ndefensive breakthroughs). We also integrated our approach into an open-source\nlibrary and demonstrated compatibility with multiple commercial and open\ndatasets, enabling cross-provider evaluation and reproducible

A central challenge for agentic tasks is the growing context length,\nas agents must accumulate long histories of actions and observations. This\nexpansion raises costs and reduces efficiency in long-horizon tasks, yet prior\nwork on context compression has mostly focused on single-step tasks or narrow\napplications. We introduce Agent Context Optimization (ACON), a unified\nframework that optimally compresses both environment observations and\ninteraction histories into concise yet informative condensations. ACON\nleverages compression guideline optimization in natural language space: given\npaired trajectories where full context succeeds but compressed context fails,\ncapable LLMs analyze the causes of failure, and the compression guideline is\nupdated accordingly. Furthermore, we propose distilling the optimized LLM\ncompressor into smaller models to reduce the overhead of the additional module.\nExperiments on AppWorld, OfficeBench, and Multi-objective QA show that ACON\nreduces memory usage by 26-54% (peak tokens) while largely preserving task\nperformance, preserves over 95% of accuracy when distilled into smaller\ncompressors, and enhances smaller LMs as long-horizon agents with up to 46%\nperformance improvement.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 ACON\uc740 \ud658\uacbd \uad00\ucc30 \ubc0f \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uae30\ub85d\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc555\ucd95\ud558\uc5ec \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub7c9\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uba74\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub3d9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c LLM\uc744 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \ucee4\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uacb0\uad6d \uae34 \ubb38\ub9e5 \uae38\uc774\uc640 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc774 \uc694\uad6c\ub41c\ub2e4.", "method": "ACON\uc740 \ud658\uacbd \uad00\ucc30\uacfc \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uae30\ub85d\uc744 \uc555\ucd95\ud558\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc778 \uc804\uccb4 \ubb38\ub9e5\uacfc \uc2e4\ud328\ud558\ub294 \uc555\ucd95 \ubb38\ub9e5\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uc555\ucd95 \uac00\uc774\ub4dc\ub77c\uc778 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "AppWorld, OfficeBench, Multi-objective QA \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 ACON\uc740 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub7c9\uc744 26-54% \uc904\uc774\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uace0, \uc555\ucd95\uae30\ub85c \uc99d\ub958\ub420 \ub54c 95% \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba70, \uc18c\ud615 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \ucd5c\ub300 46%\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "ACON\uc740 LLM\uc758 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uace0 \uae34 \uc218\uba85\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c\uc11c\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ub370 \uae30\uc5ec\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \ud604\uc2e4 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc774 \ubc30\uce58\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774 \ud604\uc0c1\uc740 \uc774\uc720 \uc81c\uc2dc\uc640 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \ubaa8\ub450 \uc694\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub294 \ub298\uc5b4\ub098\ub294 \ubb38\ub9e5 \uae38\uc774\ub85c, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uae34 \ud589\ub3d9 \ubc0f \uad00\ucc30 \uae30\ub85d\uc744 \ucd95\uc801\ud574\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud655\uc7a5\uc740 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uae34 \uae30\uac04 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ud0a4\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubb38\ub9e5 \uc555\ucd95\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc774\uc804 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc8fc\ub85c \ub2e8\uc77c \ub2e8\uacc4 \uc791\uc5c5 \ub610\ub294 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\ud574 \uc654\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud658\uacbd \uad00\ucc30\uacfc \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uae30\ub85d\uc744 \uac04\uacb0\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc720\uc775\ud55c \uc751\ucd95\uccb4\ub85c \ucd5c\uc801 \uc555\ucd95\ud558\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubb38\ub9e5 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654(ACON)\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

To balance\nconservatism and accuracy, these sets must include realistic probability\ndistributions by leveraging information from the nominal distribution. Assuming\nthat nominal distributions arise from a structural causal model with a directed\nacyclic graph $\\mathcal{G}$ and structural equations, previous methods such as\nadapted and $\\mathcal{G}$-causal optimal transport have only utilized causal\ngraph information in designing ambiguity sets. In this work, we propose\nincorporating structural equations, which include causal graph information, to\nenhance ambiguity sets, resulting in more realistic distributions. We introduce\nstructural causal optimal transport and its associated ambiguity set,\ndemonstrating their advantages and connections to previous methods. A key\nbenefit of our approach is a relaxed version, where a regularization term\nreplaces the complex causal constraints, enabling an efficient algorithm via\ndifference-of-convex programming to solve structural causal optimal transport.\nWe also show that when structural information is absent and must be estimated,\nour approach remains effective and provides finite sample guarantees. Lastly,\nwe address the radius of ambiguity sets, illustrating how our method overcomes\nthe curse of dimensionality in optimal transport problems, achieving faster\nshrinkage with dimension-free order.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc778\uacfc \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \ubaa8\ud638\uc131 \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubd84\ud3ec \uac15\uac74 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \ud655\ub960 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \ubaa8\ud638\uc131 \uc9d1\ud569\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc778\uacfc \ucd5c\uc801 \uc6b4\uc1a1 \ubc0f \uad00\ub828 \ubaa8\ud638\uc131 \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0, \uc778\uacfc \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc640 \uad6c\uc870 \ubc29\uc815\uc2dd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc778\uacfc \uc81c\uc57d \ub300\uc2e0 \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \ud56d\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c \uc644\ud654\ub41c \ubc84\uc804\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ub0b4\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ucc28\uc6d0 \ubb34\uad00\ud55c \uc21c\uc11c\ub85c \ucd5c\uc801 \uc6b4\uc1a1 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba70 \uc720\ud55c \uc0d8\ud50c \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubd84\ud3ec \uac15\uac74 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub294 \ubaa8\ud638\uc131 \uc9d1\ud569\uc73c\ub85c \uc54c\ub824\uc9c4 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\ud3ec \ubc94\uc704\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ucc44\ud0dd\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uacfc\uc801\ud569 \ubc0f \ubd84\ud3ec \ubcc0\ud654\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc0d8\ud50c \uc678 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf4\uc218\uc131\uacfc \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc9d1\ud569\uc740 \uba85\ubaa9 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \ud655\ub960 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud574\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uba85\ubaa9 \ubd84\ud3ec\uac00 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc131 \ube44\uc21c\ud658 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 $\textbf{G}$\uc640 \uad6c\uc870 \ubc29\uc815\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc778\uacfc \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \uac00\uc815\ud560 \ub54c, \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ubc0f $\textbf{G}$-\uc778\uacfc \ucd5c\uc801 \uc6b4\uc1a1\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc774\uc804 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \ubaa8\ud638\uc131 \uc9d1\ud569 \uc124\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uacfc \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uac83\ubfd0\uc774\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc778\uacfc \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \uad6c\uc870 \ubc29\uc815\uc2dd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ud638\uc131 \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uadf8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub85c \ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \uc5bb\uac8c \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc778\uacfc \ucd5c\uc801 \uc6b4\uc1a1\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ub41c \ubaa8\ud638\uc131 \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub4e4\uc758 \uc7a5\uc810 \ubc0f \uc774\uc804 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uacfc\uc758 \uc5f0\uacb0\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc7a5\uc810\uc740 \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \ud56d\uc774 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc778\uacfc \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ub300\uccb4\ud558\ub294 \uc644\ud654 \ubc84\uc804\uc774 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub85c\uc368 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc778\uacfc \ucd5c\uc801 \uc6b4\uc1a1\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ucc28\ubd84 \ubcfc\ub85d \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uad6c\ud604\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uad6c\uc870 \uc815\ubcf4\uac00 \uc5c6\uace0 \ucd94\uc815\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uc5d0\ub3c4 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\uba70 \uc720\ud55c \uc0d8\ud50c \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubaa8\ud638\uc131 \uc9d1\ud569\uc758 \ubc18\uc9c0\ub984\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8e8\uace0, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ucd5c\uc801 \uc6b4\uc1a1 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \ucc28\uc6d0\uc758 \uc800\uc8fc\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \ucc28\uc6d0 \ubb34\uad00\ud55c \uc21c\uc11c\ub85c \ub354 \ube60\ub978 \ucd95\uc18c\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Additionally, existing ideation tools are not adaptive to prior\nexperimental outcomes. We developed HARPA to address these challenges by\nincorporating the ideation workflow inspired by human researchers. HARPA first\nidentifies emerging research trends through literature mining, then explores\nhypothesis design spaces, and finally converges on precise, testable hypotheses\nby pinpointing research gaps and justifying design choices. Our evaluations\nshow that HARPA-generated hypothesis-driven research proposals perform\ncomparably to a strong baseline AI-researcher across most qualitative\ndimensions (e.g., specificity, novelty, overall quality), but achieve\nsignificant gains in feasibility(+0.78, p$<0.05$, bootstrap) and groundedness\n(+0.85, p$<0.01$, bootstrap) on a 10-point Likert scale. When tested with the\nASD agent (CodeScientist), HARPA produced more successful executions (20 vs. 11\nout of 40) and fewer failures (16 vs. 21 out of 40), showing that expert\nfeasibility judgments track with actual execution success. Furthermore, to\nsimulate how researchers continuously refine their understanding of what\nhypotheses are both testable and potentially interesting from experience, HARPA\nlearns a reward model that scores new hypotheses based on prior experimental\noutcomes, achieving approx. a 28\\% absolute gain over HARPA's untrained\nbaseline scorer.

We study the stochastic\nlinear bandit problem in a multi-agent networked setting where agents must\nsatisfy stage-wise conservative constraints. A network of $N$ agents\ncollaboratively maximizes cumulative reward while ensuring that the expected\nreward at every round is no less than $(1-\\alpha)$ times that of a baseline\npolicy. Each agent observes local rewards with unknown parameters, but the\nnetwork optimizes for the global parameter (average of local parameters).\nAgents communicate only with immediate neighbors, and each communication round\nincurs additional regret. We propose MA-SCLUCB (Multi-Agent Stage-wise\nConservative Linear UCB), an episodic algorithm alternating between action\nselection and consensus-building phases. We prove that MA-SCLUCB achieves\nregret\n$\\tilde{O}\\left(\\frac{d}{\\sqrt{N}}\\sqrt{T}\\cdot\\frac{\\log(NT)}{\\sqrt{\\log(1/|\\lambda_2|)}}\\right)$\nwith high probability, where $d$ is the dimension, $T$ is the horizon, and\n$|\\lambda_2|$ is the network's second largest eigenvalue magnitude. Our\nanalysis shows: (i) collaboration yields $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}$ improvement\ndespite local communication, (ii) communication overhead grows only\nlogarithmically for well-connected networks, and (iii) stage-wise safety adds\nonly lower-order regret. Thus, distributed learning with safety guarantees\nachieves near-optimal performance in reasonably connected networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc548\uc804

Comments and suggestions are welcome", "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) inevitably encode outdated or incorrect\nknowledge. Updating, deleting, and forgetting such knowledge is important for\nalignment, safety, and other issues. To address this issue, model editing has\nemerged as a promising paradigm: by precisely editing a small subset of\nparameters such that a specific fact is updated while preserving other\nknowledge. Despite its great success reported in previous papers, we find the\napparent reliability of editing rests on a fragile foundation and the current\nliterature is largely driven by illusory success. The fundamental goal of\nsteering the model's output toward a target with minimal modification would\nencourage exploiting hidden shortcuts, rather than utilizing real semantics.\nThis problem directly challenges the feasibility of the current model editing\nliterature at its very foundation, as shortcuts are inherently at odds with\nrobust knowledge integration. Coincidentally, this issue has long been obscured\nby evaluation frameworks that lack the design of negative examples. To uncover\nit, we systematically develop a suite of new evaluation methods. Strikingly, we\nfind that state-of-the-art approaches collapse even under the simplest negation\nqueries.

In reinforcement learning (RL), this approach has been explored to\ndefine auxiliary losses for a variety of settings, including reward-based and\nunsupervised RL, behavior cloning, and world modeling. While existing methods\nare typically limited to single-task learning, one-step prediction, or\non-policy trajectory data, we show that temporal difference (TD) learning\nenables learning representations predictive of long-term latent dynamics across\nmultiple policies from offline, reward-free transitions. Building on this, we\nintroduce TD-JEPA, which leverages TD-based latent-predictive representations\ninto unsupervised RL. TD-JEPA trains explicit state and task encoders, a\npolicy-conditioned multi-step predictor, and a set of parameterized policies\ndirectly in latent space. This enables zero-shot optimization of any reward\nfunction at test time.

Diffusion models have recently\ndemonstrated strong performance in probabilistic trajectory prediction, but\ntheir large model size and slow sampling process hinder real-world deployment.\nThis paper proposes Collaborative-Distilled Diffusion Models (CDDM), a novel\nmethod for real-time and lightweight trajectory prediction. Built upon\nCollaborative Progressive Distillation (CPD), CDDM progressively transfers\nknowledge from a high-capacity teacher diffusion model to a lightweight student\nmodel, jointly reducing both the number of sampling steps and the model size\nacross distillation iterations. A dual-signal regularized distillation loss is\nfurther introduced to incorporate guidance from both the teacher and\nground-truth data, mitigating potential overfitting and ensuring robust\nperformance. Extensive experiments on the ETH-UCY pedestrian benchmark and the\nnuScenes vehicle benchmark demonstrate that CDDM achieves state-of-the-art\nprediction accuracy. The well-distilled CDDM retains 96.2% and 95.5% of the\nbaseline model's ADE and FDE performance on pedestrian trajectories, while\nrequiring only 231K parameters and 4 or 2 sampling steps, corresponding to 161x\ncompression, 31x acceleration, and 9 ms latency. Qualitative results further\nshow that CDDM generates diverse and accurate trajectories under dynamic agent\nbehaviors and complex social interactions. By bridging high-performing\ngenerative models with practical deployment constraints, CDDM enables\nresource-efficient probabilistic prediction for AVs and ITS.

This paradigm has shown promise in addressing\nprivacy and safety concerns. However, recent findings reveal that unlearning\neffects are often fragile: post-unlearning manipulations such as weight\nquantization or fine-tuning can quickly neutralize the intended forgetting.\nPrior efforts to improve robustness primarily reformulate unlearning objectives\nby explicitly assuming the role of vulnerability sources. In this work, we take\na different perspective by investigating the role of the optimizer, independent\nof unlearning objectives and formulations, in shaping unlearning robustness. We\nshow that the 'grade' of the optimizer, defined by the level of information it\nexploits, ranging from zeroth-order (gradient-free) to first-order\n(gradient-based) to second-order (Hessian-based), is tightly linked to the\nresilience of unlearning. Surprisingly, we find that downgrading the optimizer,\nsuch as using zeroth-order methods or compressed-gradient variants (e.g.,\ngradient sign-based optimizers), often leads to stronger robustness. While\nthese optimizers produce noisier and less precise updates, they encourage\nconvergence to harder-to-disturb basins in the loss landscape, thereby\nresisting post-training perturbations. By connecting zeroth-order methods with\nrandomized smoothing, we further highlight their natural advantage for robust\nunlearning. Motivated by these insights, we propose a hybrid optimizer that\ncombines first-order and zeroth-order updates, preserving unlearning efficacy\nwhile enhancing robustness.

To address this limitation,\nwe introduce a novel data augmentation pipeline designed to enhance model\nrobustness from two perspectives: symmetry and difficulty. From the symmetry\nperspective, we propose two complementary methods: EvolAST, an Abstract Syntax\nTree (AST) based approach that targets syntactic symmetry to generate\nsemantically equivalent problem variants, and EvolDomain, which leverages LLMs\nto address semantic symmetry by translating theorems across mathematical\ndomains. From the difficulty perspective, we propose EvolDifficulty, which uses\ncarefully designed evolutionary instructions to guide LLMs in generating new\ntheorems with a wider range of difficulty. We then use the evolved data to\ntrain EvolProver, a 7B-parameter non-reasoning theorem prover. EvolProver\nestablishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) on FormalMATH-Lite with a 53.8%\npass@32 rate, surpassing all models of comparable size, including\nreasoning-based models.

However, chemical information extraction remains a formidable\nchallenge due to the inherent heterogeneity of chemical data. Current\nagent-based approaches, both general-purpose and domain-specific, exhibit\nlimited performance in this domain. To address this gap, we present ChemX, a\ncomprehensive collection of 10 manually curated and domain-expert-validated\ndatasets focusing on nanomaterials and small molecules. These datasets are\ndesigned to rigorously evaluate and enhance automated extraction methodologies\nin chemistry. To demonstrate their utility, we conduct an extensive\nbenchmarking study comparing existing state-of-the-art agentic systems such as\nChatGPT Agent and chemical-specific data extraction agents. Additionally, we\nintroduce our own single-agent approach that enables precise control over\ndocument preprocessing prior to extraction. We further evaluate the performance\nof modern baselines, such as GPT-5 and GPT-5 Thinking, to compare their\ncapabilities with agentic approaches. Our empirical findings reveal persistent\nchallenges in chemical information extraction, particularly in processing\ndomain-specific terminology, complex tabular and schematic representations, and\ncontext-dependent ambiguities.

However, the optimization stability of policy gradients in this setting\nremains understudied. As a result, existing implementations often resort to\nconservative hyperparameter choices to ensure stability, which requires more\ntraining samples and increases computational costs. Hence, developing models\nfor reliably tracking the underlying optimization dynamics and leveraging them\ninto training enables more sample-efficient regimes and further unleashes\nscalable post-training. We address this gap by formalizing the stochastic\noptimization problem of policy gradients with explicit consideration of\nsecond-order geometry. We propose a tractable computational framework that\ntracks and leverages curvature information during policy updates. We further\nemploy this framework to design interventions in the optimization process\nthrough data selection. The resultant algorithm, Curvature-Aware Policy\nOptimization (CAPO), identifies samples that contribute to unstable updates and\nmasks them out. Theoretically, we establish monotonic improvement guarantees\nunder realistic assumptions. On standard math reasoning benchmarks, we\nempirically show that CAPO ensures stable updates under aggressive learning\nregimes where baselines catastrophically fail. With minimal intervention\n(rejecting fewer than 8% of tokens), CAPO achieves up to 30x improvement in\nsample efficiency over standard GRPO for LLM reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "CAPO\ub294

Inspired by the item response theory (IRT) in psychometrics,\nwe model this probability as a function of three key factors: (i) the model's\nmulti-skill ability vector, (2) the query's discrimination vector that\nseparates models of differing skills, and (3) the query's difficulty scalar. To\nlearn these parameters jointly, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) network\nthat couples model- and query-level embeddings. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our approach leads to state-of-the-art performance in both\nmodel routing and benchmark accuracy prediction. Moreover, analysis validates\nthat the learned parameters encode meaningful, interpretable information about\nmodel capabilities and query characteristics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uad00\ub9ac\uc640 \ud65c\uc6a9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c Compact representation \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\uc548 \uc81c\uc548.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ub9ac\uc18c\uc2a4\ub97c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\uace0 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ud070 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc784.", "method": "\uc544\uc774\ud15c \ubc18\uc751 \uc774\ub860(IRT)\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825 \ubca1\ud130, \ucffc\ub9ac\uc758 \uad6c\ubd84 \ubca1\ud130, \ucffc\ub9ac\uc758 \ub09c\uc774\ub3c4 \uc2a4\uce7c\ub77c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc8fc\uc5b4\uc9c4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud2b9\uc815 \ucffc\ub9ac\uc5d0 \uc62c\ubc14\ub974\uac8c \uc751\ub2f5\ud560 \ud655\ub960 \ucd94\uc815.", "result": "\ubaa8\ub378 \ub77c\uc6b0\ud305\uacfc \uae30\uc900 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc131\ub2a5 \ub2ec\uc131.", "conclusion": "\ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378 \ub2a5\ub825\uacfc \ucffc\ub9ac \ud2b9\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc758\ubbf8 \uc788\ub294 \uc815\ubcf4\ub85c \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud568\uc744 \ud655\uc778.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc \uba87 \ub144\uac04 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \uc218\uac00 \uae09\uc99d\ud588\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc29\ub300\ud55c \ub9ac\uc18c\uc2a4\ub97c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\uace0 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ud070 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378 \ub77c\uc6b0\ud305 \ubc0f \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5 \uc608\uce21\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ub2e4\uc6b4\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9bc \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 LLM \ub2a5\ub825\uc758 Compact representation\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud2b9\uc815 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud2b9\uc815 \ucffc\ub9ac\uc5d0 \uc62c\ubc14\ub974\uac8c \ub2f5\ubcc0\ud560 \ud655\ub960\uc744 \ucd94\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\uc758\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2ec\ub9ac\uce21\uc815\ud559\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc544\uc774\ud15c \ubc18\uc751 \uc774\ub860(IRT)\uc5d0 \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc544, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \ud655\ub960\uc744 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc694\uc18c\uc758 \ud568\uc218\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: (i) \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \uae30\uc220 \ub2a5\ub825 \ubca1\ud130, (2) \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \uae30\uc220\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uad6c\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \ucffc\ub9ac\uc758 \uad6c\ubd84 \ubca1\ud130, (3) \ucffc\ub9ac\uc758 \ub09c\uc774\ub3c4 \uc2a4\uce7c\ub77c. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uacf5\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ucffc\ub9ac \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \ud63c\ud569(MoE) \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \ubaa8\ub378 \ub77c\uc6b0\ud305\uacfc \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4 \uc608\uce21 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud568\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \ubd84\uc11d \uacb0\uacfc, \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\uac00 \ubaa8\ub378 \ub2a5\ub825\uacfc \ucffc\ub9ac \ud2b9\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc758\ubbf8 \uc788\ub294 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ud568\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

These populations are usually provided by synthesizing\nfake agents through deterministic population synthesis methods. However, these\ndeterministic population synthesis methods face several challenges, such as\nhandling high-dimensional data, scalability, and zero-cell issues, particularly\nwhen generating populations for target scenarios. This research looks into how\na deep generative model called Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial\nNetwork (CT-GAN) can be used to create target populations either directly from\na collection of marginal constraints or through a hybrid method that combines\nCT-GAN with Fitness-based Synthesis Combinatorial Optimization (FBS-CO). The\nresearch evaluates the proposed population synthesis models against travel\nsurvey and zonal-level aggregated population data. Results indicate that the\nstand-alone CT-GAN model performs the best when compared with FBS-CO and the\nhybrid model. CT-GAN by itself can create realistic-looking groups that match\nsingle-variable distributions, but it struggles to maintain relationships\nbetween multiple variables. However, the hybrid model demonstrates improved\nperformance compared to FBS-CO by leveraging CT-GAN ability to generate a\ndescriptive base population, which is then refined using FBS-CO to align with\ntarget-year marginals. This study demonstrates that CT-GAN represents an\neffective methodology for target populations and highlights how deep generative\nmodels can be successfully integrated with conventional synthesis techniques to\nenhance their performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 CT-GAN\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub3c4\uc2dc \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ubaa9\ud45c \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uad50\ud1b5 \ubc0f \ub3c4\uc2dc \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc0c1\uc138\ud55c \uc778\uad6c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud558\uba70, \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uacb0\uc815\ub860\uc801 \uc778\uad6c \ud569\uc131 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uac00\uc9c0 \ubb38\uc81c\uc810\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc870\uac74\ubd80 \ud45c \ud615\uc2dd \uc0dd\uc131\uc801 \uc801\ub300 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(CT-GAN)\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub9c8\uac00\uc9c4 \uc81c\uc57d\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c1\uc811 \ub610\ub294 CT-GAN\uacfc \uc801\ud569\ub3c4 \uae30\ubc18 \ud569\uc131 \uc870\ud569 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654(FBS-CO)\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa9\ud45c \uc778\uad6c\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "CT-GAN \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 FBS-CO\uc640 \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, \ub2e8\uc77c \ubcc0\uc218 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc640 \uc77c\uce58\ud558\ub294 \uc0ac\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \uad70\uc9d1\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc \ub2e4\uc911 \ubcc0\uc218 \uac04\uc758 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\ub294\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "CT-GAN\uc740 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc5d0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uae4a\uc740 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uae30\uc874 \ud569\uc131 \uae30\uc220\uacfc \ud1b5\ud569\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uad50\ud1b5 \ubc0f \ub3c4\uc2dc \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624 \uacc4\ud68d\uc5d0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uae30\ucd08 \ubc0f \ubaa9\ud45c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc0c1\uc138\ud55c \uc778\uad6c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc694\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc778\uad6c\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uacb0\uc815\ub860\uc801 \uc778\uad6c \ud569\uc131 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uac00\uc0c1\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud569\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uc81c\uacf5\ub41c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacb0\uc815\ub860\uc801 \uc778\uad6c \ud569\uc131 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc778\uad6c \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uc5ec \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ucc98\ub9ac, \ud655\uc7a5\uc131 \ubc0f \uc81c\ub85c \uc140 \ubb38\uc81c\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uac00\uc9c0 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc870\uac74\ubd80 \ud45c \ud615\uc2dd \uc0dd\uc131\uc801 \uc801\ub300 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(CT-GAN)\uc774\ub77c\uace0 \ud558\ub294 \uae4a\uc740 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub9c8\uac00\uc9c4 \uc81c\uc57d \ubaa8\uc74c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c1\uc811 \ub610\ub294 CT-GAN\uacfc \uc801\ud569\ub3c4 \uae30\ubc18 \ud569\uc131 \uc870\ud569 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654(FBS-CO)\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc778\uad6c\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc778\uad6c \ud569\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc5ec\ud589 \uc870\uc0ac \ubc0f \uad6c\uc5ed \uc218\uc900 \uc9d1\uacc4 \uc778\uad6c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \ube44\uad50 \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4. \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ub3c5\ub9bd\ud615 CT-GAN \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 FBS-CO \ubc0f \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud588\uc744 \ub54c \uac00\uc7a5 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud560 \uac83\uc784\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b8\ub2e4.

In this paper, we introduce a\nnovel method for Automated Insights and Data Exploration (AIDE), that serves as\na robust foundation for tackling these challenges through the use of Monte\nCarlo Tree Search (MCTS). We evaluate AIDE using both real-world and synthetic\ndata, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying data transformations and\nmodels that uncover interesting data patterns. Among its strengths, AIDE's\nMCTS-based framework offers significant extensibility, allowing for future\nintegration of additional pattern extraction strategies and domain knowledge.\nThis makes AIDE a valuable step towards developing a comprehensive solution for\nautomated knowledge discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uacfc \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc774\ub04c\uc5b4\ub0b4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uc9c0\uc2dd \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 AIDE\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc870\uc9c1\ub4e4\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc744 \uc5bb\uace0 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ub0b4\ub9ac\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uc9d1\uc911\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\ub098, \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub294 \uc77c\uc774 \uc5b4\ub835\uace0 \uc2dc\uac04\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \uac78\ub9bd\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubaac\ud14c \uce74\ub97c\ub85c \ud2b8\ub9ac \ud0d0\uc0c9(MCTS)\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 \uc790\ub3d9 \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825 \ubc0f \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud0d0\uc0c9(AIDE)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "AIDE\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \ubc0f \ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud3c9\uac00\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \ud765\ubbf8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubcc0\ud658 \ubc0f \ubaa8\ub378 \uc2dd\ubcc4\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc784\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "AIDE\ub294 \ud328\ud134 \ucd94\ucd9c \uc804\ub7b5 \ubc0f \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ucd94\uac00\ub85c \ud1b5\ud569\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc774 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc5ec \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uc9c0\uc2dd \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub2e8\uacc4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc870\uc9c1\ub4e4\uc740 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \ub098\uc624\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud574 \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc744 \uc5bb\uace0 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ub0b4\ub9ac\ub294\ub370 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uc9d1\uc911\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\ud658\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc5b4\ub835\uace0 \uc2dc\uac04\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \uac78\ub9ac\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc218\uc9d1\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uc591\uacfc \uc774\ub97c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ud574\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825 \uac04\uc5d0\ub294 \uc885\uc885 \uaca9\ucc28\uac00 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uc9c0\uc2dd \ubc1c\uacac\uc774 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uc9c0\uc2dd \ubc1c\uacac\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud0d0\uc0c9, \uc554\ubb35\uc801 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378 \uad6c\ucd95, \uc8fc\uad00\uc801\uc778 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc640 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud558\ub294 \ub4f1 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc5f4\ub9b0 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubaac\ud14c \uce74\ub97c\ub85c \ud2b8\ub9ac \ud0d0\uc0c9(MCTS)\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9 \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825 \ubc0f \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud0d0\uc0c9(AIDE)\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

While consistency models\nhave achieved promising results on Euclidean domains like images, their\napplications to Riemannian manifolds remain challenging due to the curved\ngeometry. In this work, we propose the Riemannian Consistency Model (RCM),\nwhich, for the first time, enables few-step consistency modeling while\nrespecting the intrinsic manifold constraint imposed by the Riemannian\ngeometry. Leveraging the covariant derivative and exponential-map-based\nparameterization, we derive the closed-form solutions for both discrete- and\ncontinuous-time training objectives for RCM. We then demonstrate theoretical\nequivalence between the two variants of RCM: Riemannian consistency\ndistillation (RCD) that relies on a teacher model to approximate the marginal\nvector field, and Riemannian consistency training (RCT) that utilizes the\nconditional vector field for training. We further propose a simplified training\nobjective that eliminates the need for the complicated differential\ncalculation. Finally, we provide a unique kinematics perspective for\ninterpreting the RCM objective, offering new theoretical angles. Through\nextensive experiments, we manifest the superior generative quality of RCM in\nfew-step generation on various non-Euclidean manifolds, including flat-tori,\nspheres, and the 3D rotation group SO(3).", "AI": {"tldr": "Riemannian \uc77c\uad00\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378(RCM)\uc740 \ube44\uc720\ud074\ub9ac\ub4dc \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc5d0\uc11c \uba87 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub85c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ube44\uc720\ud074\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc601\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uacfc Riemannian \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc758 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "RCM\uc740 \uacf5\ubcc0 \ub3c4\ud568\uc218\uc640 \uc9c0\uc218 \ub9f5 \uae30\ubc18 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec RCM\uc758 \uc774\uc0b0 \ubc0f \uc5f0\uc18d \uc2dc\uac04 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud3d0\uc1c4 \ud615\ud0dc\uc758 \ud574\ub97c \uc720\ub3c4\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "RCM\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ube44\uc720\ud074\ub9ac\ub4dc \ub2e4\uc591\uccb4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc0dd\uc131 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, Riemannian \uc77c\uad00\uc131 \uc99d\ub958(RCD)\uc640 Riemannian \uc77c\uad00\uc131 \ud6c8\ub828(RCT)\uc758 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ub3d9\ub4f1\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "RCM\uc758 \ub3c5\ud2b9\ud55c \uc6b4\ub3d9\ud559\uc801 \uad00\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uac01\ub3c4\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc77c\uad00\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ud655\uc0b0 \ubc0f \ud750\ub984 \uc77c\uce58 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uba87 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc758 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc77c\uad00\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc720\ud074\ub9ac\ub4dc \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uace1\uc120 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ub9ac\ub9cc \ub2e4\uc591\uccb4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc751\uc6a9\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \ubb38\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub9ac\ub9cc \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc774 \ubd80\uacfc\ud558\ub294 \ub0b4\ubd80 \ub2e4\uc591\uccb4 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \uc900\uc218\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ucd5c\ucd08\ub85c \uba87 \ub2e8\uacc4 \uc77c\uad00\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \ub9ac\ub9cc \uc77c\uad00\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378(RCM)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacf5\ubcc0 \ub3c4\ud568\uc218\uc640 \uc9c0\uc218 \ub9f5 \uae30\ubc18 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, RCM\uc758 \uc774\uc0b0 \ubc0f \uc5f0\uc18d \uc2dc\uac04 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud3d0\uc1c4 \ud615\ud0dc\uc758 \ud574\ub97c \uc720\ub3c4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7f0 \ub2e4\uc74c, \ub9c8\uc9c4 \ubca1\ud130 \ud544\ub4dc\ub97c \uadfc\uc0ac\ud558\ub294 \uad50\uc0ac \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294 \ub9ac\ub9cc \uc77c\uad00\uc131 \uc99d\ub958(RCD)\uc640 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc870\uac74\ubd80 \ubca1\ud130 \ud544\ub4dc\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub9ac\ub9cc \uc77c\uad00\uc131 \ud6c8\ub828(RCT)\uc758 RCM \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubcc0\ud615 \uac04\uc758 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ub3d9\ub4f1\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ubbf8\ubd84 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uc5c6\uc560\ub294 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud654\ub41c \ud6c8\ub828 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub3c4 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c, RCM \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ud574\uc11d\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub3c5\ud2b9\ud55c \uc6b4\ub3d9\ud559\uc801 \uad00\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc5ec \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uac01\ub3c4\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 RCM\uc774 \ud3c9\uba74 \ud1a0\ub7ec\uc2a4, \uad6c \ubc0f 3D \ud68c\uc804 \uad70 SO(3)\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ube44\uc720\ud074\ub9ac\ub4dc \ub2e4\uc591\uccb4\uc5d0\uc11c \uba87 \ub2e8\uacc4 \uc0dd\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc0dd\uc131 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Recent large language model\n(LLM)-based quantum circuit generation has emerged as a promising automatic\nsolution. However, the fundamental challenges remain unaddressed: (i)\nparameterized quantum gates require precise numerical values for optimal\nperformance, which also depend on multiple aspects, including the number of\nquantum gates, their parameters, and the layout/depth of the circuits. (ii)\nLLMs often generate low-quality or incorrect quantum circuits due to the lack\nof quantum domain-specific knowledge. We propose QUASAR, an agentic\nreinforcement learning (RL) framework for quantum circuits generation and\noptimization based on tool-augmented LLMs. To align the LLM with\nquantum-specific knowledge and improve the generated quantum circuits, QUASAR\ndesigns (i) a quantum circuit verification approach with external quantum\nsimulators and (ii) a sophisticated hierarchical reward mechanism in RL\ntraining. Extensive evaluation shows improvements in both syntax and semantic\nperformance of the generated quantum circuits. When augmenting a 4B LLM, QUASAR\nhas achieved the validity of 99.31% in Pass@1 and 100% in Pass@10,\noutperforming industrial LLMs of GPT-4o, GPT-5 and DeepSeek-V3 and several\nsupervised-fine-tuning (SFT)-only and RL-only baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "QUASAR\ub294 \ud000\ud140 \ud68c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131 \ubc0f \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c RL \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, LLM\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uc5ec \ud000\ud140 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud574 \ud000\ud140 \ud68c\ub85c\uc758 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud000\ud140 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305\uc758 \uc774\uc810\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud2b9\uc815 \ud000\ud140 \ud68c\ub85c\uc758 \uc124\uacc4 \ubc0f \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uac00 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "QUASAR\ub294 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc99d\uac15 LLM\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c RL \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc678\ubd80 \ud000\ud140 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c \ud68c\ub85c \uac80\uc99d \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uacfc \uc815\uad50\ud55c \uacc4\uce35 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "QUASAR\ub294 \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \ud000\ud140 \ud68c\ub85c\uc758 \uad6c\ubb38 \ubc0f \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \uc131\ub2a5 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc73c\uba70, 4B LLM\uc744 \uc99d\uac15\ud588\uc744 \ub54c Pass@1\uc5d0\uc11c 99.31%, Pass@10\uc5d0\uc11c 100%\uc758 \uc720\ud6a8\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "QUASAR\ub294 GPT-4o, GPT-5, DeepSeek-V3 \uac19\uc740 \uc0b0\uc5c5 LLM\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc791\uc5c5 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc591\uc790 \ud68c\ub85c\uc758 \uc124\uacc4 \ubc0f \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub294 \uc591\uc790 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305\uc758 \uc774\uc810\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uc591\uc790 \ud68c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\uc774 \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uc790\ub3d9 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc73c\ub85c \ub5a0\uc62c\ub790\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uba87 \uac00\uc9c0 \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ud574\uacb0\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4: (i) \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ud654\ub41c \uc591\uc790 \uac8c\uc774\ud2b8\ub294 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc218\uce58 \uac12\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc591\uc790 \uac8c\uc774\ud2b8\uc758 \uc218, \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \ubc0f \ud68c\ub85c\uc758 \ub808\uc774\uc544\uc6c3/\uae4a\uc774 \ub4f1 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uce21\uba74\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ub2ec\ub77c\uc9d1\ub2c8\ub2e4.

GEM also\nfeatures a diverse suite of environments, robust integrated tools, and\nsingle-file example scripts demonstrating using GEM with five popular RL\ntraining frameworks. Along with this, we also provide a set of baselines across\n24 environments using REINFORCE with Return Batch Normalization (ReBN), which\n-- unlike GRPO -- is compatible with the full RL setting of dense per-turn\nrewards and offers better credit assignment. We further conduct apple-to-apple\nbenchmarking of PPO, GRPO and REINFORCE in both single- and multi-turn settings\nusing GEM to shed light on the algorithmic designs.

Despite rapid progress,\nexisting frameworks and definitions are fragmented, and there is no systematic\nformulation or analysis of which design choices matter across tasks. We address\nthis gap by first breaking down the design space into three inter-related\npillars -- environment, reward, and policy -- and empirically derive a recipe\nfor training LLM agents in situated textual domains. In particular, we test\nTextWorld and ALFWorld, popular domains for testing situated embodied\nreasoning, as well as SWE-Gym for more software engineering style tasks. (i)\nFor the environment, we analyze the impacts of task complexity in terms of\nsizes of the state and action spaces as well as optimal solution length,\nfinding that even simple environments within a domain can provide signal on how\nwell an agent can generalize to more complex tasks. (ii) For the reward, we\nablate relative reward sparsity, observing that while dense turn-level rewards\naccelerate training, performance and stability is highly dependent on the\nchoice of RL algorithm.

To\naddress this gap, we introduce Toucan, the largest publicly available\ntool-agentic dataset to date, containing 1.5 million trajectories synthesized\nfrom nearly 500 real-world Model Context Protocols (MCPs). Unlike prior work,\nToucan leverages authentic MCP environments to generate diverse, realistic, and\nchallenging tasks with trajectories involving real tool execution. Our pipeline\nfirst produces a broad spectrum of tool-use queries using five distinct models,\napplies model-based quality filtering, and then generates agentic trajectories\nwith three teacher models using two agentic frameworks. Rigorous rule-based and\nmodel-based validation ensures high-quality outputs. We also introduce three\nextension mechanisms to further diversify tasks and simulate multi-turn\nconversations.

Our analysis reveals that\nupcycled MoEs, even with conventional regularization, exhibit low-confidence,\nweakly differentiated routing, hindering performance. We introduce\nDirichlet-Prior Shaping Loss (DPSL), a novel router regularization technique\nthat directly shapes routing probability distributions by matching expert\nassignments to a target Dirichlet prior. DPSL offers fine-grained control over\nexpert balance and specialization, and enables encoding of inductive biases\nsuch as encouraging experts to focus on specific modalities or tasks, without\nrequiring manual intervention; notably, DPSL is a general tool applicable to\nany module that outputs categorical probability distributions, extending its\nutility beyond MoE training. Experiments on upcycled MoE vision-language models\n(with Qwen2, Phi3, Llama3.2 LLM backbones) show DPSL consistently outperforms\nupcycling strategies and regularization techniques across standard\nvision-language benchmarks, addressing the critical issue of poor\nspecialization and fostering more adaptive, higher-performing models.", "AI": {"tldr": "DPSL \uae30\ubc95\uc774 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uade0\ud615\uacfc \uc804\ubb38\ud654\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uc5ec MoE \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub192\uc778\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubbf8\ub9ac \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \uc870\ubc00\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud76c\uc18c\ud55c \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \ud63c\ud569\uccb4(MoE)\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\uba74 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc6a9\ub7c9\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc758 \uc804\ubb38\ud654\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud574 \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce5c\ub2e4.", "method": "DPSL(Dirichlet-Prior Shaping Loss)\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub77c\uc6b0\ud130 \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \ud560\ub2f9\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c Dirichlet \uc0ac\uc804\uacfc \uc77c\uce58\uc2dc\ucf1c \ub77c\uc6b0\ud305 \ud655\ub960 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \uc9c1\uc811 \ud615\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "DPSL\uc740 MoE \ube44\uc804-\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uc0c1\ud5a5 \ubcc0\ud658 \uc804\ub7b5\uacfc \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\uba70, \uc804\ubb38\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc774\uba70 \uace0\uc131\ub2a5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "DPSL\uc740 MoE \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \ub118\uc5b4 \ubc94\uc6a9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c\uc774\uba70, \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc758 \ud2b9\uc815 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\ub098 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc9d1\uc911\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc870\ubc00\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud76c\uc18c \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \ud63c\ud569\uccb4(MoEs)\ub85c \uc5c5\uc0ac\uc774\ud074\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc6a9\ub7c9\uc744 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uac00\uc911\uce58 \ubcf5\uc81c \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc804\ubb38\ud654\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud55c \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0 \ub530\ub974\uba74, \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc815\uaddc\ud654\uac00 \uc801\uc6a9\ub41c \uc5c5\uc0ac\uc774\ud074\ub41c MoEs\uc870\ucc28\ub3c4 \ub0ae\uc740 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub3c4\uc640 \uc57d\ud558\uac8c \uad6c\ubd84\ub41c \ub77c\uc6b0\ud305\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\uc5b4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc800\ud574\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \ud560\ub2f9\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c Dirichlet \uc0ac\uc804\uacfc \uc77c\uce58\uc2dc\ud0b4\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ub77c\uc6b0\ud305 \ud655\ub960 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \uc9c1\uc811 \ud615\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub77c\uc6b0\ud130 \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \uae30\ubc95\uc778 Dirichlet-Prior Shaping Loss(DPSL)\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.
