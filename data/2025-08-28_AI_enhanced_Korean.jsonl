However, manually linking CVEs to their corresponding TTPs is a\nchallenging and time-consuming task, and the high volume of new vulnerabilities\npublished annually makes automated support desirable.\n  This paper introduces TRIAGE, a two-pronged automated approach that uses\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) to map CVEs to relevant techniques from the ATT&CK\nknowledge base. We first prompt an LLM with instructions based on MITRE's CVE\nMapping Methodology to predict an initial list of techniques. This list is then\ncombined with the results from a second LLM-based module that uses in-context\nlearning to map a CVE to relevant techniques. This hybrid approach\nstrategically combines rule-based reasoning with data-driven inference. Our\nevaluation reveals that in-context learning outperforms the individual mapping\nmethods, and the hybrid approach improves recall of exploitation techniques. We\nalso find that GPT-4o-mini performs better than Llama3.3-70B on this task.\nOverall, our results show that LLMs can be used to automatically predict the\nimpact of cybersecurity vulnerabilities and TRIAGE makes the process of mapping\nCVEs to ATT&CK more efficient.\n  Keywords: vulnerability impact, CVE, ATT&CK techniques, large language\nmodels, automated mapping.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774

Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising solution by enabling\ncollaborative risk assessment without centralizing user data. However, existing\nFL approaches struggle with Non-Independent and Identically Distributed\n(Non-IID) user features, resulting in biased, unstable, and poorly generalized\nglobal models. This paper introduces FL-RBA2, a novel Federated Learning\nframework for Risk-Based Adaptive Authentication that addresses Non-IID\nchallenges through a mathematically grounded similarity transformation. By\nconverting heterogeneous user features (including behavioral, biometric,\ncontextual, interaction-based, and knowledge-based modalities) into IID\nsimilarity vectors, FL-RBA2 supports unbiased aggregation and personalized risk\nmodeling across distributed clients. The framework mitigates cold-start\nlimitations via clustering-based risk labeling, incorporates Differential\nPrivacy (DP) to safeguard sensitive information, and employs Message\nAuthentication Codes (MACs) to ensure model integrity and authenticity.\nFederated updates are securely aggregated into a global model, achieving strong\nbalance between user privacy, scalability, and adaptive authentication\nrobustness. Rigorous game-based security proofs in the Random Oracle Model\nformally establish privacy, correctness, and adaptive security guarantees.\nExtensive experiments on keystroke, mouse, and contextual datasets validate\nFL-RBA2's effectiveness in high-risk user detection and its resilience to model\ninversion and inference attacks, even under strong DP constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774

The goal is to better understand how these specialists voluntarily\nuse this tool.\n  Background: Human-automation teams have been extensively studied, but\ntransformer-based language models have sparked a new wave of collaboration. SOC\npersonnel at a major cybersecurity provider used an LLM to support live\nsecurity operations. This study examines how these specialists incorporated the\nLLM into their work.\n  Method: Our data set is the result of 10 months of SOC operators accessing\nGPT-4 over an internally deployed HTTP-based chat application. We performed two\ntopic modelling exercises, first using the established BERTopic model\n(Grootendorst, 2022), and second, using a novel topic modeling workflow.\n  Results: Both the BERTopic analysis and novel modelling approach revealed\nthat SOC operators primarily used the LLM to facilitate their understanding of\ncomplex text strings. Variations on this use-case accounted for ~40% of SOC LLM\nusage.\n  Conclusion: SOC operators are required to rapidly interpret complex commands\nand similar information. Their natural tendency to leverage LLMs to support\nthis activity indicates that their workflow can be supported and augmented by\ndesigning collaborative LLM tools for use in the SOC.\n  Application: This work can aid in creating next-generation tools for Security\nOperations Centres. By understanding common use-cases, we can develop workflows\nsupporting SOC task flow. One example is a right-click context menu for\nexecuting a command line analysis LLM call directly in the SOC environment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc6b4\uc601

Instead of relying on one\nmodel alone, we take inspiration from gossip protocols in distributed systems,\nwhere information is exchanged with peers until they all come to an agreement.\nIn this setup, models exchange answers and gradually work toward a shared\nsolution. Each LLM acts as a node in a peer-to-peer network, sharing responses\nand thought processes to reach a collective decision.

We propose a\nsimple premise: tasks that demand deeper depth of thought for humans should\nalso be harder for models. Accordingly, we define difficulty as depth of\nthought (DoT) and operationalize it by counting the discrete steps in a teacher\nmodel's reasoning trace (e.g., Chain-of-Thought). We then train with a shallow\nto deep curriculum ordered by this DoT and outline how to derive, validate, and\nschedule it at scale. Our position yields three testable hypotheses: (i) DoT\ncorrelates with conventional difficulty on reasoning benchmarks, (ii)\nDoT-ordered curricula outperform length- or judge-scored curricula under\nmatched budgets, and (iii) the difficulty is robust across teacher models given\nlight formatting controls. We propose an evaluation framework and discuss\nthreats to validity (teacher style, length confounds) alongside practical\nmitigations.

PRISM also\nexhibits strong robustness against adaptive attacks, significantly increasing\ncomputational costs for adversaries, and generalizes effectively to\nout-of-distribution challenges, reducing attack success rates to just 8.70% on\nthe challenging multi-image MIS benchmark.

They are quickly becoming the dominant paradigm for AI\napplications. However, serving them remains inefficient with today's\nframeworks. The key problem is that they expose workflows as opaque sequences\nof model and tool calls that tightly couple agent logic with model and hardware\nchoices. Often, these workflow components are fragmented across different\nentities, preventing systems from reasoning about trade-offs across accuracy,\nlatency, energy, and cost. This leads to resource waste and degraded\nservice-level objectives (SLOs).\n  We present Murakkab, a resource-efficient serving system for agentic\nworkflows. Murakkab introduces a declarative abstraction that decouples\nworkflow specification from execution configuration. A profile-guided optimizer\nand adaptive runtime jointly manage the full stack: orchestrating workflow\ncomponents, mapping them to models and hardware, and dynamically reconfiguring\nexecution to satisfy user-defined SLOs. By exposing the internal structure of\nagentic workflows, Murakkab enables cross-layer optimization that existing\nframeworks and cloud schedulers cannot achieve.\n  Our evaluation on diverse workflows shows that \\sysname{} reduces GPU usage\nby up to 2.8$\\times$, energy consumption by 3.7$\\times$, and cost by\n4.3$\\times$ while maintaining SLOs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Murakkab\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc790\uc6d0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0 \uc0ac\uc591\uacfc \uc2e4\ud589 \uad6c\uc131\uc744 \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\uc5ec \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc81c\uc5b4 \ub17c\ub9ac\ub85c \uc870\uc815\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c\ub294 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "Murakkab\uc740 \uc120\uc5b8\uc801 \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0 \uc0ac\uc591\uacfc \uc2e4\ud589 \uad6c\uc131\uc744 \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\uace0, \ud504\ub85c\ud30c\uc77c \uac00\uc774\ub4dc\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uae30\uc640 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ub7f0\ud0c0\uc784\uc774 \uc804\uccb4 \uc2a4\ud0dd\uc744 \uad00\ub9ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "Murakkab\uc740 GPU \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub7c9\uc744 \ucd5c\ub300 2.8\ubc30 \uc904\uc774\uace0, \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc18c\ube44\ub97c 3.7\ubc30 \uc904\uc774\uba70, \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 4.3\ubc30 \uc808\uac10\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Murakkab\uc740 \uae30\uc874 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc640 \ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\ub7ec\uac00 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \ud06c\ub85c\uc2a4 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc81c\uc5b4 \ub17c\ub9ac\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub294 AI \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c0\ubc30\uc801\uc778 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc774 \ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc624\ub298\ub0a0\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c\ub294 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc8fc\uc694 \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\uac00 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ub3c4\uad6c \ud638\ucd9c\uc758 \ubd88\ud22c\uba85\ud55c \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\ub85c \ub178\ucd9c\ub418\uc5b4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ub17c\ub9ac\uc640 \ubaa8\ub378 \ubc0f \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uc120\ud0dd\uc744 \uae34\ubc00\ud558\uac8c \uacb0\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc885\uc885 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub294 \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \uc5d4\ud130\ud2f0\uc5d0 \ubd84\uc0b0\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uc815\ud655\uc131, \ub300\uae30 \uc2dc\uac04, \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \ubc0f \ube44\uc6a9 \uac04\uc758 Trade-off\ub97c \uc0ac\uace0\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc790\uc6d0 \ub0ad\ube44\uc640 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uc218\uc900 \ubaa9\ud45c(SLO)\uc758 \uc800\ud558\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc9d1\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc790\uc6d0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc778 Murakkab\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

In this study, we propose a\nmulti-modal machine learning framework that integrates Sentence Transformer\nembeddings with attention-based sequence-to-sequence architectures to predict\nthe drift of leeway objects in water. We begin by experimentally collecting\nenvironmental and physical data, including water current and wind velocities,\nobject mass, and surface area, for five distinct leeway objects. Using\nsimulated data from a Navier-Stokes-based model to train a convolutional neural\nnetwork on geometrical image representations, we estimate drag and lift\ncoefficients of the leeway objects. These coefficients are then used to derive\nthe net forces responsible for driving the objects' motion. The resulting time\nseries, comprising physical forces, environmental velocities, and\nobject-specific features, combined with textual descriptions encoded via a\nlanguage model, are inputs to attention-based sequence-to-sequence\nlong-short-term memory and Transformer models, to predict future drift\ntrajectories. We evaluate the framework across multiple time horizons ($1$,\n$3$, $5$, and $10$ seconds) and assess its generalization across different\nobjects. We compare our approach against a fitted physics-based model and\ntraditional machine learning methods, including recurrent neural networks and\ntemporal convolutional neural networks. Our results show that these multi-modal\nmodels perform comparably to traditional models while also enabling longer-term\nforecasting in place of single-step prediction. Overall, our findings\ndemonstrate the ability of a multi-modal modeling strategy to provide accurate\nand adaptable predictions of leeway object drift in dynamic maritime\nconditions.", "AI":

However, many studies showed that they are vulnerable to\nknowledge corruption attacks, where an attacker can inject adversarial texts\ninto the knowledge database of a RAG system to induce the LLM to generate\nattacker-desired outputs. Existing studies mainly focus on attacking specific\nqueries or queries with similar topics (or keywords). In this work, we propose\nUniC-RAG, a universal knowledge corruption attack against RAG systems. Unlike\nprior work, UniC-RAG jointly optimizes a small number of adversarial texts that\ncan simultaneously attack a large number of user queries with diverse topics\nand domains, enabling an attacker to achieve various malicious objectives, such\nas directing users to malicious websites, triggering harmful command execution,\nor launching denial-of-service attacks. We formulate UniC-RAG as an\noptimization problem and further design an effective solution to solve it,\nincluding a balanced similarity-based clustering method to enhance the attack's\neffectiveness. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that UniC-RAG is highly\neffective and significantly outperforms baselines. For instance, UniC-RAG could\nachieve over 90% attack success rate by injecting 100 adversarial texts into a\nknowledge database with millions of texts to simultaneously attack a large set\nof user queries (e.g., 2,000). Additionally, we evaluate existing defenses and\nshow that they are insufficient to defend against UniC-RAG, highlighting the\nneed for new defense mechanisms in RAG systems.", "AI": {"tldr":

Research has\nshown that this form of leaner-centered learning is best cultivated through\nstructured, supportive environments that promote guided practice, scaffolded\ninquiry, and collaborative dialogue. In response, educational efforts have\nincreasingly embraced artificial-intelligence (AI)-powered digital learning\nenvironments, ranging from educational apps and virtual labs to serious games.\nRecent advances in large language models (LLMs) and neuro-symbolic systems,\nmeanwhile, offer a transformative opportunity to reimagine how support is\ndelivered in digital learning environments. LLMs are enabling socially\ninteractive learning experiences and scalable, cross-domain learning support\nthat can adapt instructional strategies across varied subjects and contexts. In\nparallel, neuro-symbolic AI provides new avenues for designing these agents\nthat are not only adaptive but also scalable across domains. Based on these\nremarks, this paper presents a multi-agent, neuro-symbolic framework designed\nto resolve the aforementioned challenges. The framework assigns distinct\npedagogical roles to specialized agents: an RL-based 'tutor' agent provides\nauthoritative, non-verbal scaffolding, while a proactive, LLM-powered 'peer'\nagent facilitates the social dimensions of learning. While prior work has\nexplored such agents in isolation, our framework's novelty lies in unifying\nthem through a central educational ontology. Through case studies in both\ncollege-level and middle school settings, we demonstrate the framework's\nadaptability across domains. We conclude by outlining key insights and future\ndirections for advancing AI-driven learning environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud559\uc0dd\ub4e4\uc774 \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc8fc\ub3c4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ub3d5\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2e0\uacbd \uc0c1\uc9d5\uc801 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud559\uc0dd\ub4e4\uc774 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uc124\uc815\ud558\uace0, \uc9c4\ud589 \uc0c1\ud669\uc744 \ucd94\uc801\ud558\uba70, \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud588\uc744 \ub54c \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud0a4\uc6b0\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uad50\uc721\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c \uc911 \ud558\ub098\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 RL \uae30\ubc18\uc758 '\ud29c\ud130' \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 LLM \uae30\ubc18\uc758 '\ub610\ub798' \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud568\uaed8 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uad50\uc721\uc801 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub300\ud559 \ubc0f \uc911\ud559\uad50 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\ub840 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "AI \uae30\ubc18 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \ubc1c\uc804\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud575\uc2ec \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uacfc \ubbf8\ub798 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70 \ub17c\ubb38\uc744 \ub9c8\ubb34\ub9ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uad50\uc721\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uc804 \uc911 \ud558\ub098\ub294 \ud559\uc0dd\ub4e4\uc774 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc788\ub294 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uc124\uc815\ud558\uace0, \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \uc9c4\ud589 \uc0c1\ud669\uc744 \ucd94\uc801\ud558\uba70, \uc2e4\ud328\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud588\uc744 \ub54c \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc8fc\ub3c4\uad8c\uc744 \uc7a5\uc545\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ub3d5\ub294 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4. \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0 \ub530\ub974\uba74, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud615\ud0dc\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5\uc790 \uc911\uc2ec \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \uad6c\uc870\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc9c0\uc6d0\uc801\uc778 \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ucd5c\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud568\uc591\ub41c\ub2e4. \uad50\uc721\uc801 \ub178\ub825\uc740 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 AI \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \uc218\uc6a9\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ucd5c\uadfc\uc5d0\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uacfc \uc2e0\uacbd \uc0c1\uc9d5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc774 \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c0\uc6d0\uc774 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc81c\uacf5\ub418\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc0c1\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubcc0\ud601\uc801 \uae30\ud68c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.

Although Large Language Models (LLMs) and\nexisting preference optimization techniques perform well on standard\nbenchmarks, they often struggle to differentiate between physically valid and\ninvalid reasoning. This shortcoming becomes critical in high-stakes\napplications like metal joining, where seemingly plausible yet physically\nincorrect recommendations can lead to defects, material waste, equipment\ndamage, and serious safety risks. To address this challenge, we introduce\nPKG-DPO, a novel framework that integrates Physics Knowledge Graphs (PKGs) with\nDirect Preference Optimization (DPO) to enforce physical validity in\nAI-generated outputs. PKG-DPO comprises three key components A) hierarchical\nphysics knowledge graph that encodes cross-domain relationships, conservation\nlaws, and thermodynamic principles. B) A physics reasoning engine that\nleverages structured knowledge to improve discrimination between physically\nconsistent and inconsistent responses. C) A physics-grounded evaluation suite\ndesigned to assess compliance with domain-specific constraints. PKG-DPO\nachieves 17% fewer constraint violations and an 11% higher Physics Score\ncompared to KG-DPO (knowledge graph-based DPO).

The objective is to develop a methodology\nto forecast production parameters based on simple data as produced and injected\nvolumes and, eventually, gauges located in wells, without depending on\ninformation from geological models, fluid properties or details of well\ncompletions and flow systems. Initially, we performed relevance analyses of the\nproduction and injection variables, as well as conditioning the data to suit\nthe problem. As reservoir conditions change over time, concept drift is a\npriority concern and require special attention to those observation windows and\nthe periodicity of retraining, which are also objects of study. For the\nproduction forecasts, we study supervised learning methods, such as those based\non regressions and Neural Networks, to define the most suitable for our\napplication in terms of performance and complexity. In a first step, we\nevaluate the methodology using synthetic data generated from the UNISIM III\ncompositional simulation model. Next, we applied it to cases of real plays in\nthe Brazilian pre-salt. The expected result is the design of a reliable\npredictor for reproducing reservoir dynamics, with rapid response, capability\nof dealing with practical difficulties such as restrictions in wells and\nprocessing units, and that can be used in actions to support reservoir\nmanagement, including the anticipation of deleterious behaviors, optimization\nof production and injection parameters and the analysis of the effects of\nprobabilistic events, aiming to maximize oil recovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c

These rules are\nderived from extensive Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI), which includes attack\nsignatures and behavioral patterns obtained through automated tools and manual\nthreat analysis, such as sandboxing. The CTI is then transformed into\nactionable rules for the IDS engine, enabling real-time detection and\nprevention. However, the constant evolution of cyber threats necessitates\nfrequent rule updates, which delay deployment time and weaken overall security\nreadiness. Recent advancements in agentic systems powered by Large Language\nModels (LLMs) offer the potential for autonomous IDS rule generation with\ninternal evaluation. We introduce FALCON, an autonomous agentic framework that\ngenerates deployable IDS rules from CTI data in real-time and evaluates them\nusing built-in multi-phased validators. To demonstrate versatility, we target\nboth network (Snort) and host-based (YARA) mediums and construct a\ncomprehensive dataset of IDS rules with their corresponding CTIs. Our\nevaluations indicate FALCON excels in automatic rule generation, with an\naverage of 95% accuracy validated by qualitative evaluation with 84%\ninter-rater agreement among multiple cybersecurity analysts across all metrics.\nThese results underscore the feasibility and effectiveness of LLM-driven data\nmining for real-time cyber threat mitigation.", "AI": {"tldr": "FALCON\uc740 CTI \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \ubc30\ud3ec \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c IDS \uaddc\uce59\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uac80\uc99d\uae30\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \uc704\ud611\uc758 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uc9c4\ud654\ub85c \uc778\ud574 IDS \uaddc\uce59\uc758 \ube48\ubc88\ud55c \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub294 \ubc30\ud3ec \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc900\ube44 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \uc57d\ud654\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "method": "FALCON\uc740 CTI \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubc30\ud3ec \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c IDS \uaddc\uce59\uc744 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 \ub0b4\ubd80 \uac80\uc99d \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "result": "FALCON\uc740 \uc790\ub3d9 \uaddc\uce59 \uc0dd\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \ud3c9\uade0 95% \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uae30\ub85d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uacb0\uacfc\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ub9c8\uc774\ub2dd\uc774 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \uc704\ud611 \uc644\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uacfc \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc11c\uba85 \uae30\ubc18 \uce68\uc785 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(IDS)\uc740 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ub610\ub294 \ud638\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud65c\ub3d9\uc744 \uc0ac\uc804 \uc815\uc758\ub41c \uaddc\uce59\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec \uc545\uc758\uc801\uc778 \ud65c\ub3d9\uc744 \uac10\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uaddc\uce59\uc740 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ub3c4\uad6c\uc640 \uc0cc\ub4dc\ubc15\uc2a4\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc218\ub3d9 \uacf5\uaca9 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5bb\uc740 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc11c\uba85 \ubc0f \ud589\ub3d9 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \uc704\ud611 \uc815\ubcf4(CTI)\uc5d0\uc11c \ud30c\uc0dd\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Molu", "Angelique Taylor"], "title": "Skill-Aligned Fairness in Multi-Agent Learning for Collaboration in Healthcare", "comment": null, "summary": "Fairness in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is often framed as a\nworkload balance problem, overlooking agent expertise and the structured\ncoordination required in real-world domains. In healthcare, equitable task\nallocation requires workload balance or expertise alignment to prevent burnout\nand overuse of highly skilled agents. Workload balance refers to distributing\nan approximately equal number of subtasks or equalised effort across healthcare\nworkers, regardless of their expertise. We make two contributions to address\nthis problem. First, we propose FairSkillMARL, a framework that defines\nfairness as the dual objective of workload balance and skill-task alignment.\nSecond, we introduce MARLHospital, a customizable healthcare-inspired\nenvironment for modeling team compositions and energy-constrained scheduling\nimpacts on fairness, as no existing simulators are well-suited for this\nproblem. We conducted experiments to compare FairSkillMARL in conjunction with\nfour standard MARL methods, and against two state-of-the-art fairness metrics.\nOur results suggest that fairness based solely on equal workload might lead to\ntask-skill mismatches and highlight the need for more robust metrics that\ncapture skill-task misalignment. Our work provides tools and a foundation for\nstudying fairness in heterogeneous multi-agent systems where aligning effort\nwith expertise is critical.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \uc791\uc5c5 \ubd80\ud558 \uade0\ud615 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uace0, \uc758\ub8cc \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc804\ubb38\uc131\uacfc \uc870\uc815\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc758\ub8cc \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uacf5\uc815\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5 \ud560\ub2f9\uc740 \ubc88\uc544\uc6c3\uacfc \uace0\uc219\ub828 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uacfc\ub2e4 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \ubc29\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "FairSkillMARL \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, MARLHospital\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ub9de\ucda4\ud615 \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \ud300 \uad6c\uc131 \ubc0f \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc81c\uc57d \uc77c\uc815\uc758 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "FairSkillMARL\uc740 \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud45c\uc900 MARL \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uacf5\uc815\uc131 \uc9c0\ud45c\uc640 \ube44\uad50 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc774 \uc791\uc5c5 \ubd80\ud558\uc758 \ud3c9\ub4f1\uc5d0\ub9cc \uae30\ubc18\ud560 \uacbd\uc6b0 \uc791\uc5c5-\uae30\uc220 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc804\ubb38\uc131\uacfc \ub178\ub825\uc758 \uc870\uc815\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c\uc640 \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(MARL)\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uc791\uc5c5 \ubd80\ud558 \uade0\ud615 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \ud2c0 \uc9c0\uc5b4\uc9c0\uba70, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc804\ubb38\uc131\uacfc \ud604\uc2e4 \uc138\uacc4 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uc694\uad6c\ub418\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uac04\uacfc\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc758\ub8cc \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uacf5\uc815\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5 \ud560\ub2f9\uc740 \ubc88\uc544\uc6c3\uacfc \uace0\uc219\ub828 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uacfc\ub2e4 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \ubc29\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc791\uc5c5 \ubd80\ud558 \uade0\ud615 \ub610\ub294 \uc804\ubb38\uc131 \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc791\uc5c5 \ubd80\ud558 \uade0\ud615\uc740 \uc804\ubb38\uc131\uc5d0 \uad00\uacc4\uc5c6\uc774 \uc758\ub8cc \uc885\uc0ac\uc790 \uac04\uc5d0 \ub300\ub7b5 \ub3d9\ub4f1\ud55c \uc218\uc758 \ud558\uc704 \uc791\uc5c5\uc774\ub098 \uade0\ud615 \uc7a1\ud78c \ub178\ub825\uc744 \ubd84\ubc30\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ub9d0\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uae30\uc5ec\ub97c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uccab\uc9f8, \uc791\uc5c5 \ubd80\ud558 \uade0\ud615\uacfc \uae30\uc220-\uc791\uc5c5 \uc815\ub82c\uc758 \uc774\uc911 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \uc815\uc758\ud558\ub294 FairSkillMARL\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub458\uc9f8, \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc801\ud569\ud55c \uae30\uc874 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\ud130\uac00 \uc5c6\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \ud300 \uad6c\uc131 \ubc0f \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc81c\uc57d \uc77c\uc815\uc774 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub9de\ucda4\ud615 \uc758\ub8cc \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc740 \ud658\uacbd\uc778 MARLHospital\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 FairSkillMARL\uc744 \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud45c\uc900 MARL \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uacf5\uc815\uc131 \uc9c0\ud45c\uc640 \ud568\uaed8 \ube44\uad50\ud558\ub294 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \uc2e4\uc2dc\ud588\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5-\uae30\uc220 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud558\uba70, \uae30\uc220-\uc791\uc5c5 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc9c0\ud45c\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc791\uc5c5\uc740 \uc804\ubb38\uc131\uacfc \ub178\ub825\uc744 \uc77c\uce58\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c\uc640 \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

A total of 100 students from\nBangladesh participated in our study, and our tool collected their app usage\ndata. To identify depressed and nondepressed students, we developed a diverse\nset of ML models. We selected important features using the stable approach,\nalong with 3 main types of feature selection (FS) approaches.\n  Results: Leveraging only the app usage data retrieved in 1 second, our light\ngradient boosting machine model used the important features selected by the\nstable FS approach and correctly identified 82.4% (n=42) of depressed students\n(precision=75%, F1-score=78.5%). Moreover, after comprehensive exploration, we\npresented a parsimonious stacking model where around 5 features selected by the\nall-relevant FS approach Boruta were used in each iteration of validation and\nshowed a maximum precision of 77.4% (balanced accuracy=77.9%). A SHAP analysis\nof our best models presented behavioral markers that were related to\ndepression.\n  Conclusions: Due to our system's fast and minimalistic nature, it may make a\nworthwhile contribution to identifying depression in underdeveloped and\ndeveloping regions.

However, in mixed\nautonomy environments where CAVs coexist with human-driven vehicles (HDVs),\nachieving efficient coordination among CAVs remains challenging due to\nheterogeneous driving behaviors. To address this, this paper proposes a\nmultiagent truncated rollout approach that enhances CAV speed coordination to\nimprove highway throughput while reducing computational overhead. In this\napproach, a traffic density evolution equation is formulated that\ncomprehensively accounts for the presence or absence of CAVs, and a distributed\ncoordination control framework is established accordingly. By incorporating\nkinematic information from neighbor agents and employing an agent-by-agent\nsequential solution mechanism, our method enables explicit cooperation among\nCAVs. Furthermore, we introduce a truncated rollout scheme that adaptively\nshortens the optimization horizon based on the evaluation of control sequences.\nThis significantly reduces the time complexity, thereby improving real-time\nperformance and scalability. Theoretical analysis provides rigorous guarantees\non the stability and performance improvement of the system. Simulations\nconducted on real-world bottleneck scenarios demonstrate that, in large-scale\nmixed traffic flows, the proposed method outperforms conventional model\npredictive control methods by reducing both the average travel time in the\nbottleneck area and overall computational time, highlighting its strong\npotential for practical deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "CAV\uc640 HDV\uac00

We prompt LMs to\ngenerate Python programs that serve as generalised policies for solving PDDL\nproblems from a given domain. Notably, our approach synthesises policies that\nare provably sound relative to the PDDL domain without reliance on external\nverifiers. We conduct experiments on competition benchmarks which show that our\npolicies can solve more PDDL problems than PDDL planners and recent LM\napproaches within a fixed time and memory constraint. Our approach manifests in\nthe LMPlan planner which can solve planning problems with several hundreds of\nrelevant objects. Surprisingly, we observe that LMs used in our framework\nsometimes plan more effectively over PDDL problems written in meaningless\nsymbols in place of natural language; e.g. rewriting (at dog kitchen) as (p2 o1\no3).

In this paper, we present\nNeuroPathX, an explainable deep learning framework that uses an early fusion\nstrategy powered by cross-attention mechanisms to capture meaningful\ninteractions between structural variations in the brain derived from MRI and\nestablished biological pathways derived from genetics data. To enhance\ninterpretability and robustness, we introduce two loss functions over the\nattention matrix - a sparsity loss that focuses on the most salient\ninteractions and a pathway similarity loss that enforces consistent\nrepresentations across the cohort. We validate NeuroPathX on both autism\nspectrum disorder and Alzheimer's disease.

Prior attacks attempt to extend VLM output sequences by\noptimizing adversarial images, thereby increasing inference costs. However,\nthese extended outputs often introduce irrelevant abnormal content,\ncompromising attack stealthiness. This trade-off between effectiveness and\nstealthiness poses a major limitation for existing attacks. To address this\nchallenge, we propose \\textit{Hidden Tail}, a stealthy resource consumption\nattack that crafts prompt-agnostic adversarial images, inducing VLMs to\ngenerate maximum-length outputs by appending special tokens invisible to users.\nOur method employs a composite loss function that balances semantic\npreservation, repetitive special token induction, and suppression of the\nend-of-sequence (EOS) token, optimized via a dynamic weighting strategy.\nExtensive experiments show that \\textit{Hidden Tail} outperforms existing\nattacks, increasing output length by up to 19.2$\\times$ and reaching the\nmaximum token limit, while preserving attack stealthiness. These results\nhighlight the urgent need to improve the robustness of VLMs against\nefficiency-oriented adversarial threats.

Yet in real-world contexts, an intelligent agent's\ndecisions are shaped not only by logic but also by deeper influences such as\nbeliefs, values, and preferences. The diversity of human decision-making styles\nemerges from these differences, highlighting that \"style\" is an essential but\noften overlooked dimension of intelligence.\n  This dissertation introduces playstyle as an alternative lens for observing\nand analyzing the decision-making behavior of intelligent agents, and examines\nits foundational meaning and historical context from a philosophical\nperspective. By analyzing how beliefs and values drive intentions and actions,\nwe construct a two-tier framework for style formation: the external interaction\nloop with the environment and the internal cognitive loop of deliberation. On\nthis basis, we formalize style-related characteristics and propose measurable\nindicators such as style capacity, style popularity, and evolutionary dynamics.\n  The study focuses on three core research directions: (1) Defining and\nmeasuring playstyle, proposing a general playstyle metric based on discretized\nstate spaces, and extending it to quantify strategic diversity and competitive\nbalance; (2) Expressing and generating playstyle, exploring how reinforcement\nlearning and imitation learning can be used to train agents exhibiting specific\nstylistic tendencies, and introducing a novel approach for human-like style\nlearning and modeling; and (3) Practical applications, analyzing the potential\nof these techniques in domains such as game design and interactive\nentertainment.\n  Finally, the dissertation outlines future extensions, including the role of\nstyle as a core element in building artificial general intelligence (AGI).", "AI": {"tldr":

They have been shown to be both\ntheoretically and empirically superior to existing deep learning approaches for\nlearning value functions for search in symbolic planning. In this paper, we\nintroduce new WLF hyperparameters and study their various tradeoffs and\neffects. We utilise the efficiency of WLFs and run planning experiments on\nsingle core CPUs with a sample size of 1,000,000 to understand the effect of\nhyperparameters on training and planning. Our experimental analysis show that\nthere is a robust and best set of hyperparameters for WLFs across the tested\nplanning domains. We find that the best WLF hyperparameters for learning\nheuristic functions minimise execution time rather than maximise model\nexpressivity.

Yet, as these models grow\nin size and deployment, their robustness under input perturbations becomes an\nincreasingly urgent question. Existing robustness methods often diverge between\nsmall-parameter and large-scale models (LLMs), and they typically rely on\nlabor-intensive, sample-specific adversarial designs. In this paper, we propose\na unified, local (sample-level) robustness framework (SALMAN) that evaluates\nmodel stability without modifying internal parameters or resorting to complex\nperturbation heuristics. Central to our approach is a novel Distance Mapping\nDistortion (DMD) measure, which ranks each sample's susceptibility by comparing\ninput-to-output distance mappings in a near-linear complexity manner. By\ndemonstrating significant gains in attack efficiency and robust training, we\nposition our framework as a practical, model-agnostic tool for advancing the\nreliability of transformer-based NLP systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ubcc0\ud658\uae30 \uae30\ubc18 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uacac\uace0\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569\ub41c \ub85c\uceec \uacac\uace0\uc131 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud06c\uae30\uc640 \ubc30\ud3ec\uac00 \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc785\ub825 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uacac\uace0\uc131\uc774 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uc911\uc694\ud574\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub0b4\ubd80 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uc218\uc815\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ubcc0\ub3d9 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 SALMAN\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569\ub41c \ub85c\uceec \uacac\uace0\uc131 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uac01 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc758 \ubbfc\uac10\ub3c4\ub97c \ube44\uad50\ud558\ub294 '\uac70\ub9ac \ub9e4\ud551 \uc65c\uace1(DMD)' \ucc99\ub3c4\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uacf5\uaca9 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uacac\uace0\ud55c \ud6c8\ub828\uc5d0\uc11c \ud070 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30 \uae30\ubc18 NLP \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uad6c\uc560\ubc1b\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub85c \uc790\ub9ac\uc7a1\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ubcc0\ud658\uae30 \uae30\ubc18 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \uc218\ub9ce\uc740 NLP \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc774\ub04c\uc5b4\ub0c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud06c\uae30\uc640 \ubc30\ud3ec\uac00 \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc785\ub825 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacac\uace0\uc131\uc774 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc9c8\ubb38\uc774 \ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uacac\uace0\uc131 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uc791\uc740 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ubaa8\ub378 \uac04\uc5d0 \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub178\ub3d9 \uc9d1\uc57d\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc0d8\ud50c \ud2b9\uc815 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc124\uacc4\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub0b4\ubd80 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uc218\uc815\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ubcc0\ub3d9 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569\ub41c \uad6d\ubd80(\uc0d8\ud50c \uc218\uc900) \uacac\uace0\uc131 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c(SALMAN)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec\uc740 \uac01 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc758 \ubbfc\uac10\ub3c4\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uac70\ub9ac \ub9e4\ud551 \uc65c\uace1(DMD) \ucc99\ub3c4\ub85c, \uc785\ub825-\ucd9c\ub825 \uac70\ub9ac \ub9e4\ud551\uc744 \uadfc\uc0ac\uc120\ud615 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ub3c4\ub85c \ube44\uad50\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacf5\uaca9 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uacac\uace0\ud55c \ud6c8\ub828\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90c\uc73c\ub85c\uc368, \uc6b0\ub9ac \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30 \uae30\ubc18 NLP \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uad6c\uc560\ubc1b\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub85c \uc790\ub9ac\uc7a1\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

This paper presents MATRIX (Multi-Agent simulaTion\nfRamework for safe Interactions and conteXtual clinical conversational\nevaluation), a structured, extensible framework for safety-oriented evaluation\nof clinical dialogue agents.\n  MATRIX integrates three components: (1) a safety-aligned taxonomy of clinical\nscenarios, expected system behaviors and failure modes derived through\nstructured safety engineering methods; (2) BehvJudge, an LLM-based evaluator\nfor detecting safety-relevant dialogue failures, validated against expert\nclinician annotations; and (3) PatBot, a simulated patient agent capable of\nproducing diverse, scenario-conditioned responses, evaluated for realism and\nbehavioral fidelity with human factors expertise, and a patient-preference\nstudy.\n  Across three experiments, we show that MATRIX enables systematic, scalable\nsafety evaluation. BehvJudge with Gemini 2.5-Pro achieves expert-level hazard\ndetection (F1 0.96, sensitivity 0.999), outperforming clinicians in a blinded\nassessment of 240 dialogues. We also conducted one of the first realism\nanalyses of LLM-based patient simulation, showing that PatBot reliably\nsimulates realistic patient behavior in quantitative and qualitative\nevaluations. Using MATRIX, we demonstrate its effectiveness in benchmarking\nfive LLM agents across 2,100 simulated dialogues spanning 14 hazard scenarios\nand 10 clinical domains.\n  MATRIX is the first framework to unify structured safety engineering with\nscalable, validated conversational AI evaluation, enabling regulator-aligned\nsafety auditing.

We propose a generic, fully explainable,\ntraining-free framework that integrates global knowledge and local information\nvia Composite Potential Fields, combining three interpretable maps-Information,\nConfidence, and Connectivity-into a single kernel-filtered decision criterion.\nOur parametric, designer-driven approach requires only a handful of decay and\nweight parameters-no retraining-to smoothly adapt across both occupancy-grid\nand NavMesh-partition abstractions. We evaluate on five representative game\nmaps, two player-control policies, and five guard modes, confirming that our\nmethod outperforms classical baseline methods in both capture efficiency and\npatrol naturalness. Finally, we show how common stealth mechanics-distractions\nand environmental elements-integrate naturally into our framework as sub\nmodules, enabling rapid prototyping of rich, dynamic, and responsive guard\nbehaviors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc7a0\uc785 \uac8c\uc784\uc5d0\uc11c \uacbd\ube44 \uc21c\ucc30 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2a4\ud154\uc2a4 \uac8c\uc784\uc758 \ubab0\uc785\uac10\uacfc \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \uae4a\uc774\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uacbd\ube44 \uc21c\ucc30 \ud589\ub3d9\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uace0\uc790 \ud568.", "method": "Composite Potential Fields\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc804\uc5ed \uc9c0\uc2dd\uacfc \uc9c0\uc5ed \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uc124\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud6c8\ub828 \ud544\uc694 \uc5c6\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uae30\ucd08 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud3ec\ud68d \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc21c\ucc30 \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7ec\uc6c0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\ud568\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud568.", "conclusion": "\uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uc2a4\ud154\uc2a4 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774 \uc27d\uac8c \ud1b5\ud569\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5b4, \uc5ed\ub3d9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ubc18\uc751\uc801\uc778 \uacbd\ube44 \ud589\ub3d9\uc758 \uc2e0\uc18d\ud55c \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ud0c0\uc774\ud551\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud568.", "translated_summary": "\uacbd\ube44 \uc21c\ucc30 \ud589\ub3d9\uc740 \uc2a4\ud154\uc2a4 \uac8c\uc784\uc758 \ubab0\uc785\uac10\uacfc \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \uae4a\uc774\uc5d0 \uc911\uc2ec\uc801\uc774\uba70, \uae30\uc874 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc740 \uc218\uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \ub9cc\ub4e0 \uacbd\ub85c \ub610\ub294 \ud2b9\uc218\ud654\ub41c \ub85c\uc9c1\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \ucee4\ubc84\ub9ac\uc9c0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \ubc18\uc751\uc801\uc778 \ucd94\uc801\uc744 \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7fd\uac8c \uade0\ud615 \uc7a1\uae30 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \uc0c1\ud669\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Composite Potential Fields\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc804\uc5ed \uc9c0\uc2dd\uacfc \uc9c0\uc5ed \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc774\uace0, \uc644\uc804\ud788 \uc124\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uba70, \ud6c8\ub828\uc774 \ud544\uc694 \uc5c6\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc138 \uac1c\uc758 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub9f5\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4, \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub3c4 \ubc0f \uc5f0\uacb0\uc131\uc744 \ub2e8\uc77c \ucee4\ub110 \ud544\ud130\ub9c1 \uacb0\uc815 \uae30\uc900\uc73c\ub85c \uacb0\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ub514\uc790\uc774\ub108 \uc8fc\ub3c4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc18c\uc218\uc758 \uac10\uc1e0 \ubc0f \uac00\uc911\uce58 \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130\ub9cc \uc694\uad6c\ud558\uba70, \uc7ac\ud6c8\ub828 \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 \uc810\uc720 \uadf8\ub9ac\ub4dc \ubc0f NavMesh \ubd84\ud560 \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654\uc5d0 \ubd80\ub4dc\ub7fd\uac8c \uc801\uc751\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e4\uc12f \uac00\uc9c0 \ub300\ud45c \uac8c\uc784 \ub9f5, \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\uc5b4 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc815\ucc45 \ubc0f \ub2e4\uc12f \uac00\uc9c0 \uacbd\ube44 \ubaa8\ub4dc\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc2e4\uc2dc\ud558\uc5ec, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ud3ec\ud68d \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc21c\ucc30 \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7ec\uc6c0\uc5d0\uc11c \uace0\uc804\uc801 \uae30\ucd08 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c, \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uc2a4\ud154\uc2a4 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc778 \ubc29\ud574 \uc694\uc18c\uc640 \ud658\uacbd \uc694\uc18c\uac00 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0 \ud558\uc704 \ubaa8\ub4c8\ub85c \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7fd\uac8c \ud1b5\ud569\ub418\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5b4, \ud48d\ubd80\ud558\uace0 \uc5ed\ub3d9\uc801\uc774\uba70 \ubc18\uc751\uc801\uc778 \uacbd\ube44 \ud589\ub3d9\uc758 \uc2e0\uc18d\ud55c \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ud0c0\uc774\ud551\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

By incorporating positional information, this\napproach provides essential guidance for modeling dependencies between elements\nacross different sequence positions. We introduce CoPE (a lightweight Complex\nPositional Encoding), a novel architecture that leverages complex-valued\nencoding to encode both content and positional information. Our approach\nreplaces traditional positional encodings with complex embeddings where the\nreal part captures semantic content and the imaginary part encodes positional\ninformation. We introduce phase-aware attention in the first layer of the\ntransformer model to capture position-dependent patterns, followed by standard\nattention layers for higher-levels. We show that CoPE doesn't exhibit long term\ndecay and is compatible with linear attention.

Our analysis reveals that analysts use LLMs as on-demand aids for\nsensemaking and context-building, rather than for making high-stakes\ndeterminations, preserving analyst decision authority. The majority of queries\nare related to interpreting low-level telemetry (e.g., commands) and refining\ntechnical communication through short (1-3 turn) interactions. Notably, 93% of\nqueries align with established cybersecurity competencies (NICE Framework),\nunderscoring the relevance of LLM use for SOC-related tasks. Despite variations\nin tasks and engagement, usage trends indicate a shift from occasional\nexploration to routine integration, with growing adoption and sustained use\namong a subset of analysts.

This paper introduces a novel\nframework for generating such levels, centered on the offline, LLM-assisted\nconstruction of reusable databases for architectural components (facilities and\nroom templates) and gameplay mechanic elements. Our multi-phase pipeline\nassembles levels by: (1) selecting and arranging instances from the Room\nDatabase to form a multi-floor global structure with an inherent topological\norder; (2) optimizing the internal layout of facilities for each room based on\npredefined constraints from the Facility Database; and (3) integrating\nprogression-based gameplay mechanics by placing components from a Mechanics\nDatabase according to their topological and spatial rules. A subsequent\ntwo-phase repair system ensures navigability. This approach combines modular,\ndatabase-driven design with constraint-based optimization, allowing for\nsystematic control over level structure and the adaptable pacing of gameplay\nelements. Initial experiments validate the framework's ability in generating\ndiverse, navigable 3D environments and its capability to simulate distinct\ngameplay pacing strategies through simple parameterization.

Despite its growing adoption, a\nfundamental question remains open: what characteristics of preference data are\nmost critical for DPO performance? In this work, we provide a systematic study\nof how preference data distribution influences DPO, from both theoretical and\nempirical perspectives. We show that the quality of chosen responses plays a\ndominant role in optimizing the DPO objective, while the quality of rejected\nresponses may have relatively limited impact. Our theoretical analysis\ncharacterizes the optimal response distribution under DPO and reveals how\ncontrastiveness between responses helps primarily by improving the chosen\nsamples. We further study an online DPO setting and show it effectively reduces\nto supervised fine-tuning on the chosen responses. Extensive experiments across\ndiverse tasks confirm our findings: improving the quality of chosen responses\nconsistently boosts performance regardless of the quality of the rejected\nresponses.

Recent studies have attempted to streamline this task by\nleveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated schema extraction.\nHowever, existing methods invariably rely on predefined regular expressions,\nnecessitating human domain expertise and severely limiting productivity gains.\nTo fundamentally address this limitation, we introduce SchemaCoder, the first\nfully automated schema extraction framework applicable to a wide range of log\nfile formats without requiring human customization within the flow. At its\ncore, SchemaCoder features a novel Residual Question-Tree (Q-Tree) Boosting\nmechanism that iteratively refines schema extraction through targeted, adaptive\nqueries driven by LLMs. Particularly, our method partitions logs into semantic\nchunks via context-bounded segmentation, selects representative patterns using\nembedding-based sampling, and generates schema code through hierarchical\nQ-Tree-driven LLM queries, iteratively refined by our textual-residual\nevolutionary optimizer and residual boosting. Experimental validation\ndemonstrates SchemaCoder's superiority on the widely-used LogHub-2.0 benchmark,\nachieving an average improvement of 21.3% over state-of-the-arts.", "AI": {"tldr": "SchemaCoder\ub294 \ub300\ub7c9\uc758 \ub85c\uadf8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\u00fa\ubc29\ud5a5 \uc2a4\ud0a4\ub9c8\ub97c \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub85c\uadf8 \uc2a4\ud0a4\ub9c8 \ucd94\ucd9c\uc740 \ub85c\uadf8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uc591\uc774 \ubc29\ub300\ud558\uc5ec \uc778\uac04\uc774 \uc77d\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud15c\ud50c\ub9bf\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\ub294 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc778 \uacfc\uc815\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc \ub178\ub3d9 \uc9d1\uc57d\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "SchemaCoder\ub294 LLM\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc790\ub3d9 \uc2a4\ud0a4\ub9c8 \ucd94\ucd9c\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \ub85c\uadf8 \ud30c\uc77c \ud615\uc2dd\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc778\uac04\uc758 \ucee4\uc2a4\ud130\ub9c8\uc774\uc9d5 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc801\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "result": "SchemaCoder\ub294 LogHub-2.0 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uade0 21.3% \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc6b0\uc218\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub85c\uadf8 \uc2a4\ud0a4\ub9c8 \ucd94\ucd9c\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba70 \ub192\uc740 \uc0dd\uc0b0\uc131 \uc99d\ub300\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub85c\uadf8 \uc2a4\ud0a4\ub9c8 \ucd94\ucd9c\uc740 \ubc29\ub300\ud55c \ub85c\uadf8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uac04\uc774 \uc77d\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud15c\ud50c\ub9bf\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\ub294 \uacfc\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc \ub178\ub3d9 \uc9d1\uc57d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc54c\ub824\uc838 \uc788\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uc2a4\ud0a4\ub9c8 \ucd94\ucd9c\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub824\uace0 \uc2dc\ub3c4\ud588\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc120\ud589 \uc815\uc758\ub41c \uc815\uaddc \ud45c\ud604\uc2dd\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \uc778\uac04\uc758 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc804\ubb38 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uace0 \uc0dd\uc0b0\uc131 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uc2ec\uac01\ud558\uac8c \uc81c\ud55c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc81c\ud55c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \ucee4\uc2a4\ud130\ub9c8\uc774\uc9d5\uc774 \ud544\uc694 \uc5c6\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub85c\uadf8 \ud30c\uc77c \ud615\uc2dd\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \uc644\uc804 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uc2a4\ud0a4\ub9c8 \ucd94\ucd9c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 SchemaCoder\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.

More\nspecifically, ProtoEHR models relationships within and across three\nhierarchical levels of EHRs: medical codes, hospital visits, and patients. We\nfirst leverage large language models to extract semantic relationships among\nmedical codes and construct a medical knowledge graph as the knowledge source.\nBuilding on this, we design a hierarchical representation learning framework\nthat captures contextualized representations across three levels, while\nincorporating prototype information within each level to capture intrinsic\nsimilarities and improve generalization. To perform a comprehensive assessment,\nwe evaluate ProtoEHR in two public datasets on five clinically significant\ntasks, including prediction of mortality, prediction of readmission, prediction\nof length of stay, drug recommendation, and prediction of phenotype. The\nresults demonstrate the ability of ProtoEHR to make accurate, robust, and\ninterpretable predictions compared to baselines in the literature.

Unlike traditional cyberattacks, APTs are stealthy,\nadaptive, and long-lasting, often bypassing signature-based detection systems.\nThis paper introduces a novel framework for APT detection that unites deep\nlearning, reinforcement learning (RL), and active learning into a cohesive,\nadaptive defense system. Our system combines auto-encoders for latent\nbehavioral encoding with a multi-agent ensemble of RL-based defenders, each\ntrained to distinguish between benign and malicious process behaviors. We\nidentify a critical challenge in existing detection systems: their static\nnature and inability to adapt to evolving attack strategies. To this end, our\narchitecture includes multiple RL agents (Q-Learning, PPO, DQN, adversarial\ndefenders), each analyzing latent vectors generated by an auto-encoder. When\nany agent is uncertain about its decision, the system triggers an active\nlearning loop to simulate expert feedback, thus refining decision boundaries.\nAn ensemble voting mechanism, weighted by each agent's performance, ensures\nrobust final predictions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 APT(\uc9c0\uc18d\uc801 \uc704\ud611) \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4

Yet, advancements\nin AI-driven diagnostic support are hindered by data scarcity, particularly for\nunderrepresented populations and rare manifestations of NTDs. Existing\ndermatological datasets often lack the demographic and disease spectrum crucial\nfor developing reliable recognition models of NTDs. To address this, we\nintroduce eSkinHealth, a novel dermatological dataset collected on-site in\nC\\^ote d'Ivoire and Ghana. Specifically, eSkinHealth contains 5,623 images from\n1,639 cases and encompasses 47 skin diseases, focusing uniquely on skin NTDs\nand rare conditions among West African populations. We further propose an\nAI-expert collaboration paradigm to implement foundation language and\nsegmentation models for efficient generation of multimodal annotations, under\ndermatologists' guidance.

However, the widespread use of machine learning in V2X systems\nraises issues over the privacy of the data involved. This is particularly\nconcerning for smart-transit and driver safety applications which can\nimplicitly reveal user locations or explicitly disclose medical data such as\nEEG signals. To resolve these issues, we propose SecureV2X, a scalable,\nmulti-agent system for secure neural network inferences deployed between the\nserver and each vehicle. Under this setting, we study two multi-agent V2X\napplications: secure drowsiness detection, and secure red-light violation\ndetection. Our system achieves strong performance relative to baselines, and\nscales efficiently to support a large number of secure computation interactions\nsimultaneously.

Creative writing requires a balance between subjective writing\nquality (e.g., literariness and emotional expression) and objective constraint\nfollowing (e.g., format requirements and word limits). Existing reinforcement\nlearning methods struggle to balance these two aspects: single reward\nstrategies fail to improve both abilities simultaneously, while fixed-weight\nmixed-reward methods lack the ability to adapt to different writing scenarios.\nTo address this problem, we propose Reinforcement Learning with Mixed Rewards\n(RLMR), utilizing a dynamically mixed reward system from a writing reward model\nevaluating subjective writing quality and a constraint verification model\nassessing objective constraint following. The constraint following reward\nweight is adjusted dynamically according to the writing quality within sampled\ngroups, ensuring that samples violating constraints get negative advantage in\nGRPO and thus penalized during training, which is the key innovation of this\nproposed method. We conduct automated and manual evaluations across diverse\nmodel families from 8B to 72B parameters. Additionally, we construct a\nreal-world writing benchmark named WriteEval for comprehensive evaluation.\nResults illustrate that our method achieves consistent improvements in both\ninstruction following (IFEval from 83.36\\% to 86.65\\%) and writing quality\n(72.75\\% win rate in manual expert pairwise evaluations on WriteEval). To the\nbest of our knowledge, RLMR is the first work to combine subjective preferences\nwith objective verification in online RL training, providing an effective\nsolution for multi-dimensional creative writing optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc8fc\uad00\uc801 \uc791\ubb38 \ud488\uc9c8\uacfc \uac1d\uad00\uc801 \uc81c\uc57d \uc900\uc218\ub97c \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0

While federated learning enables\nprivacy-preserving collaboration without sharing raw data, it remains\nvulnerable to anomalous updates and privacy leakage during parameter exchange.\nThese challenges are amplified in open industrial environments, necessitating\nzero-trust mechanisms where no participant is inherently trusted. To address\nthese challenges, this work proposes ZTFed-MAS2S, a zero-trust federated\nlearning framework that integrates a multi-head attention-based\nsequence-to-sequence imputation model. ZTFed integrates verifiable differential\nprivacy with non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs and a confidentiality and\nintegrity verification mechanism to ensure verifiable privacy preservation and\nsecure model parameters transmission. A dynamic trust-aware aggregation\nmechanism is employed, where trust is propagated over similarity graphs to\nenhance robustness, and communication overhead is reduced via sparsity- and\nquantization-based compression. MAS2S captures long-term dependencies in wind\npower data for accurate imputation. Extensive experiments on real-world wind\nfarm datasets validate the superiority of ZTFed-MAS2S in both federated\nlearning performance and missing data imputation, demonstrating its\neffectiveness as a secure and efficient solution for practical applications in\nthe energy sector.", "AI": {"tldr": "ZTFed-MAS2S\ub294 \uc81c\ub85c \ud2b8\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \ud48d\ub825 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uacb0\uce21 \uac12\uc744 \uc815\ud655\ud788 \ubcf4\uc644\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud48d\ub825 \ubc1c\uc804 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub294 \uc13c\uc11c \uacb0\ud568 \ubc0f \ubd88\uc548\uc815\ud55c \uc804\uc1a1\uc73c\ub85c \uacb0\uce21 \uac12\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uae30 \uc27d\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uacf5\uc720 \uc5c6\uc774 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc\ub97c \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\ub294 \ud611\ub825\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \uad50\ud658 \uc911 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc801 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\uc640 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc \uc720\ucd9c\uc758 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc774 \uc874\uc7ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "ZTFed\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud5e4\ub4dc \uc8fc\uc758 \uae30\ubc18 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4-\ud22c-\uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4 \ubcf4\uc644 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \uc81c\ub85c \ud2b8\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ucc28\ubcc4\uc801 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc\uc640 \ube44\ub300\uba74 \uc81c\ub85c \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc99d\uba85\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc \ubcf4\ud638\ub97c \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uba70, \uc2e0\ub8b0 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc9d1\uacc4 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\uc81c \ud48d\ub825 \ubc1c\uc804\uc18c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 ZTFed-MAS2S\uac00 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \uacb0\uce21 \uac12 \ubcf4\uc644 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\ud568\uc774 \ud655\uc778\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "ZTFed-MAS2S\ub294 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \ubd84\uc57c\uc758 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801 \uc751\uc6a9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc548\uc804\ud558\uace0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc73c\ub85c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc784\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud48d\ub825 \ubc1c\uc804 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub294 \uc13c\uc11c \uacb0\ud568 \ubc0f \ubd88\uc548\uc815\ud55c \uc804\uc1a1\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uacb0\uce21 \uac12 \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \uc6d0\uc2dc \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uacf5\uc720\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0\ub3c4 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc\ub97c \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\ub294 \ud611\uc5c5\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \uad50\ud658 \uc911 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\uc640 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc \uc720\ucd9c\uc758 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \uacf5\uac1c \uc0b0\uc5c5 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ub354\uc6b1 \ubd80\uac01\ub418\uc5b4, \ucc38\uc5ec\uc790\uac00 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc81c\ub85c \ud2b8\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud5e4\ub4dc \uc8fc\uc758 \uae30\ubc18 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4-\ud22c-\uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4 \ubcf4\uc644 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \uc81c\ub85c \ud2b8\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 ZTFed-MAS2S\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

There are\nsignificant challenges to the IoT's growth and development, mainly due to the\ncentralized nature and large-scale IoT networks. The emphasis on the\ndecentralization of IoT's architecture can overcome challenges to IoT's\ncapabilities. A promising decentralized platform for IoT is blockchain. Owing\nto IoT devices' limited resources, traditional consensus algorithms such as PoW\nand PoS in the blockchain are computationally expensive. Therefore, the PoA\nconsensus algorithm is proposed in the blockchain consensus network for IoT.\nThe PoA selects the validator as Turn-based selection (TBS) that needs\noptimization and faces system reliability, energy consumption, latency, and low\nscalability. We propose an efficient, lightweight blockchain for decentralizing\nIoT architecture by using virtualization and clustering to increase\nproductivity and scalability to address these issues. We also introduce a novel\nPoA based on the Weight-Based-Selection (WBS) method for validators to validate\ntransactions and add them to the blockchain. By simulation, we evaluated the\nperformance of our proposed WBS method as opposed to TBS.

Current evaluation frameworks remain\nfragmented, prioritizing technical metrics while neglecting holistic assessment\nfor deployment. This survey introduces an anthropomorphic evaluation paradigm\nthrough the lens of human intelligence, proposing a novel three-dimensional\ntaxonomy: Intelligence Quotient (IQ)-General Intelligence for foundational\ncapacity, Emotional Quotient (EQ)-Alignment Ability for value-based\ninteractions, and Professional Quotient (PQ)-Professional Expertise for\nspecialized proficiency. For practical value, we pioneer a Value-oriented\nEvaluation (VQ) framework assessing economic viability, social impact, ethical\nalignment, and environmental sustainability. Our modular architecture\nintegrates six components with an implementation roadmap. Through analysis of\n200+ benchmarks, we identify key challenges including dynamic assessment needs\nand interpretability gaps.

During multi-turn interactions\nbetween agents and users, the dynamic, uncertain, and stochastic nature of user\ndemands poses significant challenges to the agent's tool invocation\ncapabilities. Agents are no longer expected to simply call tools to deliver a\nresult; rather, they must iteratively refine their understanding of user needs\nthrough communication while simultaneously invoking tools to resolve user\nqueries.

It can be viewed as partitioning a large Feed-Forward Network\n(FFN) at the tensor level into fine-grained sub-FFNs, or experts, and\nactivating only a sparse subset for each input. While this sparsity improves\nefficiency, MoE still faces substantial challenges due to their massive\ncomputational scale and unpredictable activation patterns.\n  To enable efficient MoE deployment, we identify dual sparsity at the tensor\nand neuron levels in pre-trained MoE modules as a key factor for both accuracy\nand efficiency. Unlike prior work that increases tensor-level sparsity through\nfiner-grained expert design during pre-training, we introduce post-training\nexpert partitioning to induce such sparsity without retraining. This preserves\nthe mathematical consistency of model transformations and enhances both\nefficiency and accuracy in subsequent fine-tuning and inference. Building upon\nthis, we propose DualSparse-MoE, an inference system that integrates dynamic\ntensor-level computation dropping with static neuron-level reconstruction to\ndeliver significant efficiency gains with minimal accuracy loss.\n  Experimental results show that enforcing an approximate 25% drop rate with\nour approach reduces average accuracy by only 0.08%-0.28% across three\nprevailing MoE models, while nearly all degrees of computation dropping\nconsistently yield proportional computational speedups.

Traditional classifiers,\nwithout additional mechanisms, struggle to maintain performance under concept\ndrift in malware domains, as their supervised learning formulation cannot\noptimize when to defer decisions to manual labeling and adaptation. Modern\nmalware detection pipelines combine classifiers with monthly active learning\n(AL) and rejection mechanisms to mitigate the impact of concept drift. In this\nwork, we develop a novel formulation of malware detection as a one-step Markov\nDecision Process and train a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent,\nsimultaneously optimizing sample classification performance and rejecting\nhigh-risk samples for manual labeling. We evaluated the joint detection and\ndrift mitigation policy learned by the DRL-based Malware Detection (DRMD) agent\nthrough time-aware evaluations on Android malware datasets subject to realistic\ndrift requiring multi-year performance stability. The policies learned under\nthese conditions achieve a higher Area Under Time (AUT) performance compared to\nstandard classification approaches used in the domain, showing improved\nresilience to concept drift. Specifically, the DRMD agent achieved a\n$5.18\\pm5.44$, $14.49\\pm12.86$, and $10.06\\pm10.81$ average AUT performance\nimprovement for the classification only, classification with rejection, and\nclassification with rejection and AL settings, respectively. Our results\ndemonstrate for the first time that DRL can facilitate effective malware\ndetection and improved resiliency to concept drift in the dynamic environment\nof the Android malware domain.",

However, most existing agents operate in a\npurely reactive manner, responding passively to user instructions, which\nsignificantly constrains their effectiveness and efficiency as general-purpose\nplatforms for information acquisition. To overcome this limitation, this paper\nproposes AppAgent-Pro, a proactive GUI agent system that actively integrates\nmulti-domain information based on user instructions. This approach enables the\nsystem to proactively anticipate users' underlying needs and conduct in-depth\nmulti-domain information mining, thereby facilitating the acquisition of more\ncomprehensive and intelligent information.

Low-rank\ntensor decompositions are specially befitting for this task due to their close\nconnection to NNs and their rich theoretical results. Different tensor\ndecompositions have strong uniqueness guarantees, which allow for a direct\ninterpretation of their factors, and polynomial time algorithms have been\nproposed to compute them. Through the connections between tensors and NNs, such\nresults supported many important advances in the theory of NNs. In this review,\nwe show how low-rank tensor methods--which have been a core tool in the signal\nprocessing and machine learning communities--play a fundamental role in\ntheoretically explaining different aspects of the performance of deep NNs,\nincluding their expressivity, algorithmic learnability and computational\nhardness, generalization, and identifiability.

This paper introduces VistaWise, a cost-effective agent\nframework that integrates cross-modal domain knowledge and finetunes a\ndedicated object detection model for visual analysis. It reduces the\nrequirement for domain-specific training data from millions of samples to a few\nhundred.

We propose integrating Variational State as\nIntrinsic Reward (VSIMR), which uses Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs) to reward\nstate novelty, with an intrinsic reward approach derived from Large Language\nModels (LLMs). The LLMs leverage their pre-trained knowledge to generate reward\nsignals based on environment and goal descriptions, guiding the agent. We\nimplemented this combined approach with an Actor-Critic (A2C) agent in the\nMiniGrid DoorKey environment, a benchmark for sparse rewards. Our empirical\nresults show that this combined strategy significantly increases agent\nperformance and sampling efficiency compared to using each strategy\nindividually or a standard A2C agent, which failed to learn. Analysis of\nlearning curves indicates that the combination effectively complements\ndifferent aspects of the environment and task: VSIMR drives exploration of new\nstates, while the LLM-derived rewards facilitate progressive exploitation\ntowards goals.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub0b4\uc7ac\uc801 \ub3d9\uae30 \uc804\ub7b5\uc758 \uacb0\ud569\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub2e4\ub8f9\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ub4dc\ubb38 \uae0d\uc815\uc801 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "\ubcc0\ubcc4\uc801 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \ub0b4\uc7ac\uc801 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 Variational State as Intrinsic Reward (VSIMR)\uc640 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc5d0\uc11c \ud30c\uc0dd\ub41c \ub0b4\uc7ac\uc801 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud568.", "result": "\uc774 \uacb0\ud569\ub41c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 MiniGrid DoorKey \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c A2C \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uad6c\ud604\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uac1c\ubcc4 \uc804\ub7b5\uc774\ub098 \ud45c\uc900 A2C \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ucf30\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uacb0\ud569 \uc804\ub7b5\uc740 \ud658\uacbd\uacfc \uacfc\uc81c\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uce21\uba74\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\uc644\ud558\uba70, VSIMR\uc740 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc0c1\ud0dc \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\uace0 LLM \ud30c\uc0dd \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc740 \ubaa9\ud45c \ud5a5\ud55c \uc810\uc9c4\uc801 \ud65c\uc6a9\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5\uc774 \ub4dc\ubb38 \uae0d\uc815\uc801 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\ub294 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub0b4\uc7ac\uc801 \ub3d9\uae30 \uc804\ub7b5\uc758 \uacb0\ud569\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6c0\uc744 \ubcf4\uc0c1\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubcc0\ubcc4\uc801 \uc624\ud1a0\uc778\ucf54\ub354(VAEs)\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 Variational State as Intrinsic Reward (VSIMR)\uc640 \ud658\uacbd \ubc0f \ubaa9\ud45c \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc5d0\uc11c \ud30c\uc0dd\ub41c \ub0b4\uc7ac\uc801 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \uacb0\ud569\ub41c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ub4dc\ubb38 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc758 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc778 MiniGrid DoorKey \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c Actor-Critic (A2C) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \uad6c\ud604\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc774 \uacb0\ud569 \uc804\ub7b5\uc774 \uac01 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uac1c\ubcc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0 \uc2e4\ud328\ud55c \ud45c\uc900 A2C \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \ub54c\uc640 \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud559\uc2b5 \uace1\uc120 \ubd84\uc11d\uc740 \uacb0\ud569\uc774 \ud658\uacbd\uacfc \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uce21\uba74\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\uc644\ud558\uba70, VSIMR\uc740 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc758 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\uace0 LLM \ud30c\uc0dd \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc740 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ud5a5\ud55c \uc810\uc9c4\uc801 \ud65c\uc6a9\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud568\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Built on top of\ngenerative AI capabilities, Agentic AI represents a major shift toward\nautonomous, goal-driven systems that can reason, retrieve, and act. However,\nthey also inherit the bias present in both internal and external information\nsources. This significantly affects the fairness and balance of retrieved\ninformation, and hence reduces user trust. To address this critical challenge,\nwe introduce a novel Bias Mitigation Agent, a multi-agent system designed to\norchestrate the workflow of bias mitigation through specialized agents that\noptimize the selection of sources to ensure that the retrieved content is both\nhighly relevant and minimally biased to promote fair and balanced knowledge\ndissemination.

However, scaling BO to\nhigh-dimensional spaces remains challenging. Existing literature proposes\nperforming standard BO in multiple local trust regions (TuRBO) for\nheterogeneous modeling of the objective function and avoiding over-exploration.\nDespite its advantages, using local Gaussian Processes (GPs) reduces sampling\nefficiency compared to a global GP. To enhance sampling efficiency while\npreserving heterogeneous modeling, we propose to construct multiple local\nquadratic models using gradients and Hessians from a global GP, and select new\nsample points by solving the bound-constrained quadratic program. Additionally,\nwe address the issue of vanishing gradients of GPs in high-dimensional spaces.\nWe provide a convergence analysis and demonstrate through experimental results\nthat our method enhances the efficacy of TuRBO and outperforms a wide range of\nhigh-dimensional BO techniques on synthetic functions and real-world\napplications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub294 \ube44\uc2fc \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 \ud568\uc218 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc5d0 \ub110\ub9ac \uc801\uc6a9\ub418\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \uacf5\uac04\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \ud655\uc7a5\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc804\uc5ed GP\ub85c\ubd80\ud130\uc758 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30\uc640 \ud5e4\uc138\uc548\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc5ec\ub7ec \uac1c\uc758 \uc9c0\uc5ed \uc774\ucc28 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uace0 \uacbd\uacc4 \uc81c\uc57d \ub2e4\ud56d\uc2dd\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uc5ec \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc0d8\ud50c \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8\ub97c \uc120\ud0dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub2f9\uc0ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 TuRBO\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \ud569\uc131 \ud568\uc218 \ubc0f \uc2e4\uc81c \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 BO \uae30\uc220\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 GP\uc758 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \uc18c\uc2e4 \ubb38\uc81c\ub3c4 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc218\ub834 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654(BO)\ub294 \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ube44\uc2fc \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub110\ub9ac \uc801\uc6a9\ub418\uc5b4 \uc654\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c BO\ub97c \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \ubb38\ud5cc\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubaa9\ud45c \ud568\uc218\uc758 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ub2e4\uc218\uc758 \uc9c0\uc5ed \uc2e0\ub8b0 \uad6c\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c \ud45c\uc900 BO\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud558\uace0 \uacfc\ub3c4\ud55c \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \ud53c\ud560 \uac83\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc7a5\uc810\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \uc9c0\uc5ed \uac00\uc6b0\uc2dc\uc548 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4(GP)\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uba74 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c GP\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc774 \uac10\uc18c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c GP\ub85c\ubd80\ud130\uc758 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30\uc640 \ud5e4\uc138\uc548\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud574 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uac1c\uc758 \uc9c0\uc5ed \uc774\ucc28 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uace0 \uacbd\uacc4 \uc81c\uc57d \uc774\ucc28 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uc5ec \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc0d8\ud50c \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8\ub97c \uc120\ud0dd\ud560 \uac83\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c GP\uc758 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \uc18c\uc2e4 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8f9\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc218\ub834 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 TuRBO\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \ud569\uc131 \ud568\uc218 \ubc0f \uc2e4\uc81c \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 BO \uae30\uc220\uc744 \ucd08\uc6d4\ud568\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

In this work, we address these challenges by\nintroducing a reinforcement learning (RL) framework tailored for Verilog code\ngeneration. We first construct Veribench-53K, a high-quality dataset curated\nfrom over 700K Verilog problems, enriched with structured prompts, complexity\nlabels, and diverse testbenches. To tackle the problem of sparse and noisy\nreward signals, we propose a Trace-back based Rescore mechanism that leverages\nreasoning paths and iterative refinement to enhance feedback reliability and\nsupport reward model training. Furthermore, to mitigate catastrophic forgetting\nand overfitting during RL fine-tuning, we introduce a sample-balanced weighting\nstrategy that adaptively balances learning dynamics based on reward-probability\ndistributions. These innovations are integrated into an iterative RL pipeline\nthat co-evolves the policy and reward models. In contrast to recent work such\nas CraftRTL, which relies on large-scale closed-source model distillation, and\nDeepSeek-style approaches that struggle with sparse feedback, our method\ndemonstrates superior performance using a smaller but high-quality dataset\ncombined with RL optimization. Experiments on Verilog generation tasks\ndemonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with substantial gains in test pass\nrate, functional correctness, and compilation robustness. Our findings\nhighlight the potential of RL-driven approaches for structured code generation\nin hardware-centric domains.

Furthermore, they are susceptible\nto overfitting, often yielding prompt updates that generalize poorly beyond the\nimmediate task context.\n  To address these limitations, we propose Reflection-Enhanced\nMeta-Optimization (REMO), a novel framework that integrates (1) a\nmemory-augmented Reflection Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module -\nstructured as a \"mistake notebook\" and (2) a Self-Adaptive Optimizer,\nimplemented via an LLM-driven meta-controller that synthesizes epoch-level\nreflective insights to iteratively improve system-level prompting strategies.\nThis architecture enables not only local, fine-grained prompt tuning akin to\nTextGrad, but also the systematic accumulation and reuse of cross-run\noptimization knowledge, thereby supporting continual improvement over time.\n  We instantiate the REMO framework using Qwen3-32B in standard inference mode\n- without explicit chain-of-thought prompting - and evaluate its efficacy on\nthe GSM8K benchmark for mathematical reasoning. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that, compared to a TextGrad baseline, REMO achieves more stable\nand robust generalization, albeit at the cost of increased computational\noverhead.

Traditional\nmethods usually struggle with limited labeled data, high false-positive rates,\nand difficulty generalizing to novel anomaly types. To overcome these\nchallenges, we propose a reinforcement learning-based framework that integrates\ndynamic reward shaping, Variational Autoencoder (VAE), and active learning,\ncalled DRTA. Our method uses an adaptive reward mechanism that balances\nexploration and exploitation by dynamically scaling the effect of VAE-based\nreconstruction error and classification rewards. This approach enables the\nagent to detect anomalies effectively in low-label systems while maintaining\nhigh precision and recall. Our experimental results on the Yahoo A1 and Yahoo\nA2 benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method consistently\noutperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised and semi-supervised approaches.

However, real-world test data often exhibit domain\nshifts. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) addresses this challenge by adapting the\nmodel to test data during inference. While most TTA studies assume that the\ntraining and test data share the same class set (closed-set TTA), real-world\nscenarios often involve open-set data (open-set TTA), which can degrade\nclosed-set accuracy. A recent study showed that identifying open-set data\nduring adaptation and maximizing its entropy is an effective solution. However,\nthe previous method relies on the source model for filtering, resulting in\nsuboptimal filtering accuracy on domain-shifted test data. In contrast, we\nfound that the adapting model, which learns domain knowledge from noisy test\nstreams, tends to be unstable and leads to error accumulation when used for\nfiltering. To address this problem, we propose Primary-Auxiliary Filtering\n(PAF), which employs an auxiliary filter to validate data filtered by the\nprimary filter. Furthermore, we propose Knowledge-Integrated Prediction (KIP),\nwhich calibrates the outputs of the adapting model, EMA model, and source model\nto integrate their complementary knowledge for OSTTA. We validate our approach\nacross diverse closed-set and open-set datasets. Our method enhances both\nclosed-set accuracy and open-set discrimination over existing methods.

However, some questions posed to LRMs are inherently\nunanswerable, such as math problems lacking sufficient conditions. We find that\nLRMs continually fail to provide appropriate abstentions when confronted with\nthese unanswerable questions. In this paper, we systematically analyze,\ninvestigate, and resolve this issue for trustworthy AI. We first conduct a\ndetailed analysis of the distinct response behaviors of LRMs when facing\nunanswerable questions. Then, we show that LRMs possess sufficient cognitive\ncapabilities to recognize the flaws in these questions.

However, the\neffectiveness of VQAs is often constrained by the so-called barren plateau\nproblem, wherein gradients diminish exponentially as system size or circuit\ndepth increases, thereby hindering training. In this work, we propose a\nreinforcement learning (RL)-based initialization strategy to alleviate the\nbarren plateau issue by reshaping the initial parameter landscape to avoid\nregions prone to vanishing gradients. In particular, we explore several RL\nalgorithms (Deterministic Policy Gradient, Soft Actor-Critic, and Proximal\nPolicy Optimization, etc.) to generate the circuit parameters (treated as\nactions) that minimize the VQAs cost function before standard gradient-based\noptimization. By pre-training with RL in this manner, subsequent optimization\nusing methods such as gradient descent or Adam proceeds from a more favorable\ninitial state. Extensive numerical experiments under various noise conditions\nand tasks consistently demonstrate that the RL-based initialization method\nsignificantly enhances both convergence speed and final solution quality.\nMoreover, comparisons among different RL algorithms highlight that multiple\napproaches can achieve comparable performance gains, underscoring the\nflexibility and robustness of our method. These findings shed light on a\npromising avenue for integrating machine learning techniques into quantum\nalgorithm design, offering insights into how RL-driven parameter initialization\ncan accelerate the scalability and practical deployment of VQAs.

Our approach selects the\noptimal tokens from the next token distributions provided by multiple models to\nperform autoregressive reasoning. Contrary to the assumption that more models\nyield better results, we introduce a distribution distance-based dynamic\nselection strategy (DDS) to optimize the multi-model collaboration process. To\naddress the critical challenge of vocabulary misalignment in multi-model\ncollaboration, we propose the concept of minimal complete semantic units\n(MCSU), which is simple yet enables multiple language models to achieve natural\nalignment within the linguistic space. Experimental results across various\nbenchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method.

This paper\nanswers this by interpreting reasoning tasks as circuit emulation, where the\ngates define the type of reasoning; e.g. Boolean gates for predicate logic,\ntropical circuits for dynamic programming, arithmetic and analytic gates for\nsymbolic mathematical representation, and hybrids thereof for deeper reasoning;\ne.g. higher-order logic.\n  We present a systematic meta-algorithm that converts essentially any circuit\ninto a feedforward neural network (NN) with ReLU activations by iteratively\nreplacing each gate with a canonical ReLU MLP emulator. We show that, on any\ndigital computer, our construction emulates the circuit exactly--no\napproximation, no rounding, modular overflow included--demonstrating that no\nreasoning task lies beyond the reach of neural networks. The number of neurons\nin the resulting network (parametric complexity) scales with the circuit's\ncomplexity, and the network's computational graph (structure) mirrors that of\nthe emulated circuit. This formalizes the folklore that NNs networks trade\nalgorithmic run-time (circuit runtime) for space complexity (number of\nneurons).\n  We derive a range of applications of our main result, from emulating\nshortest-path algorithms on graphs with cubic--size NNs, to simulating stopped\nTuring machines with roughly quadratically--large NNs, and even the emulation\nof randomized Boolean circuits. Lastly, we demonstrate that our result is\nstrictly more powerful than a classical universal approximation theorem: any\nuniversal function approximator can be encoded as a circuit and directly\nemulated by a NN.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc774 \uc218\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ucd94\ub860 \ud615\ud0dc\ub97c \ud68c\ub85c

However, for complex tasks requiring lengthy\nsequences of actions, single-agent approaches often face challenges related to\ninefficiency and limited fault tolerance. Despite these issues, research on\nmulti-agent collaboration remains scarce. In this paper, we propose CausalMACE,\na holistic causality planning framework designed to enhance multi-agent\nsystems, in which we incorporate causality to manage dependencies among\nsubtasks. Technically, our proposed framework introduces two modules: an\noverarching task graph for global task planning and a causality-based module\nfor dependency management, where inherent rules are adopted to perform causal\nintervention. Experimental results demonstrate our approach achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in multi-agent cooperative tasks of Minecraft.", "AI": {"tldr": "Minecraft\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud611\ub825\uc744 \uc704\ud55c CausalMACE \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\uc5b4 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uacb0\ud568 \ud5c8\uc6a9 \ubc94\uc704\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "CausalMACE\ub77c\ub294 \uc804\uccb4\ub860\uc801 \uc778\uacfc \uacc4\ud68d \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \ud558\uc704 \uc791\uc5c5 \uac04\uc758 \uc885\uc18d\uc131\uc744 \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc778\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \ubcf8 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 Minecraft\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud611\ub825 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "CausalMACE\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "Minecraft\ub294 \uac1c\ubc29\ud615 \uc138\uacc4\uc758 \uac00\uc0c1 \ub300\ud654\ud615 \ud658\uacbd\uc73c\ub85c, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \ubc0f \uc2e4\ud589\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc774 \ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uac8c\uc784 \ub0b4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc644\ub8cc\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc8fc\ub85c \ub2e8\uc77c \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ucc44\ud0dd\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae34 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uacb0\ud568 \ud5c8\uc6a9 \ubc94\uc704\uc640 \uad00\ub828\ub41c \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud611\ub825\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud558\uc704 \uc791\uc5c5 \uac04\uc758 \uc885\uc18d\uc131\uc744 \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc778\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc804\uccb4\ub860\uc801 \uc778\uacfc \uacc4\ud68d \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 CausalMACE\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uae30\uc220\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc804\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uc791\uc5c5 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ucd1d\uccb4\uc801 \uc791\uc5c5 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc640 \uc885\uc18d\uc131 \uad00\ub9ac\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc778\uacfc \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc758 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 Minecraft\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud611\ub825 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4."}}

While explainable artificial\nintelligence methods aim to scrutinize model predictions by identifying\ninfluential molecular substructures, many existing approaches rely on masking\nstrategies that remove either atoms or atom-level features to assess importance\nvia fidelity metrics. These methods, however, often fail to adhere to the\nunderlying molecular distribution and thus yield unintuitive explanations. In\nthis work, we propose counterfactual masking, a novel framework that replaces\nmasked substructures with chemically reasonable fragments sampled from\ngenerative models trained to complete molecular graphs. Rather than evaluating\nmasked predictions against implausible zeroed-out baselines, we assess them\nrelative to counterfactual molecules drawn from the data distribution. Our\nmethod offers two key benefits: (1) molecular realism underpinning robust and\ndistribution-consistent explanations, and (2) meaningful counterfactuals that\ndirectly indicate how structural modifications may affect predicted properties.\nWe demonstrate that counterfactual masking is well-suited for benchmarking\nmodel explainers and yields more actionable insights across multiple datasets\nand property prediction tasks.

Current large language model (LLM)-based\nagents inherit these shortcomings through their overreliance on heuristic\npattern matching, yielding recommendations prone to shallow correlation bias,\nlimited causal inference, and brittleness in sparse-data scenarios. We\nintroduce STARec, a slow-thinking augmented agent framework that endows\nrecommender systems with autonomous deliberative reasoning capabilities. Each\nuser is modeled as an agent with parallel cognitions: fast response for\nimmediate interactions and slow reasoning that performs chain-of-thought\nrationales. To cultivate intrinsic slow thinking, we develop anchored\nreinforcement training - a two-stage paradigm combining structured knowledge\ndistillation from advanced reasoning models with preference-aligned reward\nshaping. This hybrid approach scaffolds agents in acquiring foundational\ncapabilities (preference summarization, rationale generation) while enabling\ndynamic policy adaptation through simulated feedback loops.

Using the\nIRAC (Issue-Rule-Application-Conclusion) model as an analytical framework, the\nstudy focuses on the most challenging phases of legal adjudication: determining\nthe applicable Rule (R) and performing the Application (A) of that rule to the\nfacts of a case. From a judicial perspective, the analysis deconstructs legal\nreasoning into a series of core requirements, including the ability to select\nthe correct legal framework across jurisdictions, generate sound arguments\nbased on the doctrine of legal sources, distinguish ratio decidendi from obiter\ndictum in case law, resolve ambiguity arising from general clauses like\n\"reasonableness\", manage conflicting legal provisions, and correctly apply the\nburden of proof. The paper then maps various AI enhancement mechanisms, such as\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), multi-agent systems, and neuro-symbolic\nAI, to these requirements, assessing their potential to bridge the gap between\nthe probabilistic nature of LLMs and the rigorous, choice-driven demands of\nlegal interpretation. The findings indicate that while these techniques can\naddress specific challenges, significant challenges remain, particularly in\ntasks requiring discretion and transparent, justifiable reasoning.

We propose the Stochastic\nPushForward (SPF) framework, which retains one-step-ahead training while\nenabling multi-step learning. SPF builds a supplementary dataset from model\npredictions and combines it with ground truth via a stochastic acquisition\nstrategy, balancing short- and long-term performance while reducing\noverfitting. Multi-step predictions are precomputed between epochs, keeping\nmemory usage stable without storing full unrolled sequences.

In this work, we propose a novel interactive evaluation framework\nthat assesses LLMs on multi-requirement programming tasks through structured,\nfeedback-driven dialogue. Each task is modeled as a requirement dependency\ngraph, and an ``interviewer'' LLM, aware of the ground-truth solution, provides\nminimal, targeted hints to an ``interviewee'' model to help correct errors and\nfulfill target constraints. This dynamic protocol enables fine-grained\ndiagnostic insights into model behavior, uncovering strengths and systematic\nweaknesses that static benchmarks fail to measure. We build on DevAI, a\nbenchmark of 55 curated programming tasks, by adding ground-truth solutions and\nevaluating the relevance and utility of interviewer hints through expert\nannotation.

To address this problem, student profiling becomes\ncrucial for tracking progress, identifying struggling students, and alleviating\ndisparities among students. Such profiling requires measuring student behaviors\nand performance across different aspects, such as content coverage, learning\nintensity, and proficiency in different concepts within a learning topic.\n  In this study, we introduce CTGraph, a graph-level representation learning\napproach to profile learner behaviors and performance in a self-supervised\nmanner.

However, current RL systems continue\nto grapple with substantial GPU underutilization, due to two primary factors:\n(1) The rollout stage dominates the overall RL process due to test-time\nscaling; (2) Imbalances in rollout lengths (within the same batch) result in\nGPU bubbles. While prior solutions like asynchronous execution and truncation\noffer partial relief, they may compromise training accuracy for efficiency.\n  Our key insight stems from a previously overlooked observation: rollout\nresponses exhibit remarkable similarity across adjacent training epochs. Based\non the insight, we introduce RhymeRL, an LLM RL system designed to accelerate\nRL training with two key innovations. First, to enhance rollout generation, we\npresent HistoSpec, a speculative decoding inference engine that utilizes the\nsimilarity of historical rollout token sequences to obtain accurate drafts.\nSecond, to tackle rollout bubbles, we introduce HistoPipe, a two-tier\nscheduling strategy that leverages the similarity of historical rollout\ndistributions to balance workload among rollout workers.

GNNs often learn 'spurious' correlations from superficial code\nsimilarities, producing detectors that fail to generalize well to unseen\nreal-world data. In this work, we propose a unified framework for robust and\ninterpretable vulnerability detection, called VISION, to mitigate spurious\ncorrelations by systematically augmenting a counterfactual training dataset.\nCounterfactuals are samples with minimal semantic modifications but opposite\nlabels. Our framework includes: (i) generating counterfactuals by prompting a\nLarge Language Model (LLM); (ii) targeted GNN training on paired code examples\nwith opposite labels; and (iii) graph-based interpretability to identify the\ncrucial code statements relevant for vulnerability predictions while ignoring\nspurious ones. We find that VISION reduces spurious learning and enables more\nrobust, generalizable detection, improving overall accuracy (from 51.8% to\n97.8%), pairwise contrast accuracy (from 4.5% to 95.8%), and worst-group\naccuracy (from 0.7% to 85.5%) on the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)-20\nvulnerability.

Novel hierarchical neural networks based on\n  k-nearest neighbors method for addressing hallucination effects, training\n  complexity, and catastrophic forgetting in modern AI systems.

These\nlimitations significantly hinder the use of neural networks in critical areas\nsuch as medicine, industrial process management, and scientific research. This\narticle proposes an alternative approach based on the nearest neighbors method\nwith hierarchical clustering structures. Employing the k-nearest neighbors\nalgorithm significantly reduces or completely eliminates hallucination effects\nwhile simplifying model expansion and fine-tuning without the need for\nretraining the entire network. To overcome the high computational load of the\nk-nearest neighbors method, the paper proposes using tree-like data structures\nbased on Kohonen self-organizing maps, thereby greatly accelerating nearest\nneighbor searches. Tests conducted on handwritten digit recognition and simple\nsubtitle translation tasks confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed\napproach. With only a slight reduction in accuracy, the nearest neighbor search\ntime was reduced hundreds of times compared to exhaustive search methods. The\nproposed method features transparency and interpretability, closely aligns with\nhuman cognitive mechanisms, and demonstrates potential for extensive use in\ntasks requiring high reliability and

In this paper, we propose incorporating multi-scale feature\nextraction and uncertainty estimation to improve the model's generalization and\nrobustness across domains. Our approach begins with a multi-scale mixed input\narchitecture that captures features at different scales, increasing training\ndiversity and reducing feature discrepancies between the training and testing\ndomains. Based on the mixed input architecture, we further introduce an\nuncertainty awareness mechanism based on evidential learning by imposing a\nDirichlet prior on the labels to facilitate both target prediction and\nuncertainty estimation. The uncertainty awareness mechanism enhances domain\nadaptation by aligning features with the same labels across different domains,\nwhich leads to significant performance improvements in the target domain.\nAdditionally, our uncertainty-aware model demonstrates a much lower Expected\nCalibration Error (ECE), indicating better-calibrated prediction confidence.\nOur experimental results show that this combined approach of mixed input\narchitecture with the uncertainty awareness mechanism achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance across multiple benchmark datasets, underscoring its effectiveness\nin unsupervised domain adaptation for time series data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ube44\uc9c0\ub3c4 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc801\uc751\uc744

Direct transfer from data-rich to data-scarce cities is\nunreliable because only a limited subset of source patterns truly benefits the\ntarget domain, whereas indiscriminate transfer risks introducing noise and\nnegative transfer. We present STRATA-TS (Selective TRAnsfer via TArget-aware\nretrieval for Time Series), a framework that combines domain-adapted retrieval\nwith reasoning-capable large models to improve forecasting in scarce data\nregimes. STRATA-TS employs a patch-based temporal encoder to identify source\nsubsequences that are semantically and dynamically aligned with the target\nquery. These retrieved exemplars are then injected into a retrieval-guided\nreasoning stage, where an LLM performs structured inference over target inputs\nand retrieved support. To enable efficient deployment, we distill the reasoning\nprocess into a compact open model via supervised fine-tuning. Extensive\nexperiments on three parking availability datasets across Singapore,\nNottingham, and Glasgow demonstrate that STRATA-TS consistently outperforms\nstrong forecasting and transfer baselines, while providing interpretable\nknowledge transfer pathways.", "AI": {"tldr": "STRATA-TS\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd80\uc871 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uac80\uc0c9\uacfc \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub3c4\uc2dc \uc608\uce21 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd88\uade0\ud615 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \ub3c4\uc2dc\uc5d0\uc11c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud55c \ub3c4\uc2dc\ub85c\uc758 \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc778 \uc804\uc774\uac00 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub2e4.", "method": "STRATA-TS\ub294 \ud328\uce58 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc778\ucf54\ub354\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc18c\uc2a4 \ud558\uc704 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0, \uac80\uc0c9\ub41c \uc608\uc81c\ub97c \ucd94\ub860 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0 \uc8fc\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \ud45c\uc801 \uc785\ub825\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2f1\uac00\ud3ec\ub974, \ub178\ud305\ud584, \uae00\ub798\uc2a4\uace0\uc758 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\ucc28 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 STRATA-TS\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc608\uce21 \ubc0f \uc804\uc774 \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc744 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\ub294 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "STRATA-TS\ub294 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc804\ud658 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd80\uc871 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \ub354\uc6b1 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc608\uce21 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub3c4\uc2dc \uc608\uce21 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd88\uade0\ud615 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud558\uba70, \uc77c\ubd80 \ub3c4\uc2dc\ub294 \ubc00\uc9d1\ub41c \uc7a5\uae30 \uae30\ub85d\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub9ce\uc740 \ub3c4\uc2dc\ub294 \uc9e7\uac70\ub098 \ubd88\uc644\uc804\ud55c \uc5ed\uc0ac\ub9cc\uc744 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b8\ub2e4. \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \ub3c4\uc2dc\uc5d0\uc11c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud55c \ub3c4\uc2dc\ub85c\uc758 \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc778 \uc804\uc774\ub294 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294\ub370, \uc774\ub294 \uc18c\uc2a4 \ud328\ud134\uc758 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ud558\uc704 \uc9d1\ud569\ub9cc\uc774 \ubaa9\ud45c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0 \uc9c4\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \ud61c\ud0dd\uc744 \uc8fc\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc774\uba70, \ubb34\ucc28\ubcc4 \uc804\uc774\ub294 \uc7a1\uc74c\uacfc \ubd80\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc804\uc774\uc758 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 STRATA-TS(\uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ubaa9\ud45c \uc778\uc2dd \uac80\uc0c9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \uc120\ud0dd\uc801 \uc804\uc774)\ub77c\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud55c \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uac80\uc0c9\uacfc \ucd94\ub860 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4.

Across two\nstudies, we systematically evaluated multiple AI systems' ability to predict\nhuman social appropriateness judgments for 555 everyday scenarios by examining\nhow closely they predicted the average judgment compared to each human\nparticipant. In Study 1, GPT-4.5's accuracy in predicting the collective\njudgment on a continuous scale exceeded that of every human participant (100th\npercentile). Study 2 replicated this, with Gemini 2.5 Pro outperforming 98.7%\nof humans, GPT-5 97.8%, and Claude Sonnet 4 96.0%. Despite this predictive\npower, all models showed systematic, correlated errors. These findings\ndemonstrate that sophisticated models of social cognition can emerge from\nstatistical learning over linguistic data alone, challenging strong versions of\ntheories emphasizing the exclusive necessity of embodied experience for\ncultural competence. The systematic nature of AI limitations across different\narchitectures indicates potential boundaries of pattern-based social\nunderstanding, while the models' ability to outperform nearly all individual\nhumans in this predictive task suggests that language serves as a remarkably\nrich repository for cultural knowledge transmission.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uaddc\ubc94\uc744 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\ud574\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud588\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc778\uc9c0 \uacfc\ud559\uc758 \uae30\ubcf8 \uc9c8\ubb38 \uc911 \ud558\ub098\ub294 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uaddc\ubc94\uc774 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc2b5\ub4dd\ub418\uace0 \ud45c\ud604\ub418\ub294\uc9c0\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 555\uac00\uc9c0 \uc77c\uc0c1 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uc801\uc808\uc131 \ud310\ub2e8\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud588\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc5f0\uad6c 1\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 GPT-4.5\uac00 \uc9d1\ub2e8 \ud310\ub2e8\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uac00 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc778\uac04 \ucc38\uac00\uc790\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud588\ub2e4. \uc5f0\uad6c 2\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 Gemini 2.5 Pro\uac00 98.7%\uc758 \uc778\uac04\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uace0, GPT-5\ub294 97.8%, Claude Sonnet 4\ub294 96.0%\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc0ac\ud68c \uc778\uc9c0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd9c\ud604\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uace0, \ubb38\ud654\uc801 \uc5ed\ub7c9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uccb4\ud654\ub41c \uacbd\ud5d8\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\ub294 \uc774\ub860\uc5d0 \ub3c4\uc804\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc778\uc9c0 \uacfc\ud559\uc758 \uae30\ubcf8 \uc9c8\ubb38 \uc911 \ud558\ub098\ub294 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uaddc\ubc94\uc774 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc2b5\ub4dd\ub418\uace0 \ud45c\ud604\ub418\ub294\uc9c0\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uac83\uc774\ub2e4. \uc778\uac04\uc774 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uccb4\ud654\ub41c \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uaddc\ubc94\uc744 \ubc30\uc6b0\ub294 \ubc18\uba74, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\uad50\ud55c \uaddc\ubc94 \uc774\ud574\uc5d0 \ub3c4\ub2ec\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud588\ub2e4. \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 555\uac1c \uc77c\uc0c1 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uc801\uc808\uc131 \ud310\ub2e8\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc5f0\uad6c 1\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 GPT-4.5\uc758 \uc9d1\ub2e8 \ud310\ub2e8 \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uac00 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc778\uac04 \ucc38\uac00\uc790(100\ubc88\uc9f8 \ubc31\ubd84\uc704\uc218)\ub97c \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc5f0\uad6c 2\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 Gemini 2.5 Pro\uac00 98.7%\uc758 \uc778\uac04\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uace0, GPT-5\ub294 97.8%, Claude Sonnet 4\ub294 96.0%\uc5d0 \ub2ec\ud588\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc608\uce21 \ub2a5\ub825\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc0c1\uad00\ub41c \uc624\ub958\ub97c \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc815\uad50\ud55c \uc0ac\ud68c \uc778\uc9c0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c\ub3c4 \ucd9c\ud604\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \ubb38\ud654\uc801 \uc5ed\ub7c9\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uccb4\ud654\ub41c \uacbd\ud5d8\uc758 \ub3c5\uc810\uc801 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\ub294 \uc774\ub860\uc5d0 \ub3c4\uc804\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc5d0\uc11c AI \ud55c\uacc4\uc758 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \ud2b9\uc131\uc740 \ud328\ud134 \uae30\ubc18 \uc0ac\ud68c \uc774\ud574\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \uacbd\uacc4\uc640, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc608\uce21 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uac70\uc758 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uac1c\ubcc4 \uc778\uac04\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \uc5b8\uc5b4\uac00 \ubb38\ud654 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc804\ub2ec\uc744 \uc704\ud55c remarkably rich repository \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud568\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

While machine learning models hold\npromise for predicting responses to ICIs, most existing methods lack\ninterpretability and do not effectively leverage the biological structure\ninherent to multi-omics data. Here, we introduce the Biologically Disentangled\nVariational Autoencoder (BDVAE), a deep generative model that integrates\ntranscriptomic and genomic data through modality- and pathway-specific\nencoders. Unlike existing rigid, pathway-informed models, BDVAE employs a\nmodular encoder architecture combined with variational inference to learn\nbiologically meaningful latent features associated with immune, genomic, and\nmetabolic processes. Applied to a pan-cancer cohort of 366 patients across four\ncancer types treated with ICIs, BDVAE accurately predicts treatment response\n(AUC-ROC = 0.94 on unseen test data) and uncovers critical resistance\nmechanisms, including immune suppression, metabolic shifts, and neuronal\nsignaling. Importantly, BDVAE reveals that resistance spans a continuous\nbiological spectrum rather than strictly binary states, reflecting gradations\nof tumor dysfunction. Several latent features correlate with survival outcomes\nand known clinical subtypes, demonstrating BDVAE's capability to generate\ninterpretable, clinically relevant insights.

In this paper, we introduce Experience-driven Lifelong Learning\n(ELL), a framework for building self-evolving agents capable of continuous\ngrowth through real-world interaction. The framework is built on four core\nprinciples: (1) Experience Exploration: Agents learn through continuous,\nself-motivated interaction with dynamic environments, navigating interdependent\ntasks and generating rich experiential trajectories. (2) Long-term Memory:\nAgents preserve and structure historical knowledge, including personal\nexperiences, domain expertise, and commonsense reasoning, into a persistent\nmemory system. (3) Skill Learning: Agents autonomously improve by abstracting\nrecurring patterns from experience into reusable skills, which are actively\nrefined and validated for application in new tasks. (4) Knowledge\nInternalization: Agents internalize explicit and discrete experiences into\nimplicit and intuitive capabilities as \"second nature\".\n  We also introduce StuLife, a benchmark dataset for ELL that simulates a\nstudent's holistic college journey, from enrollment to academic and personal\ndevelopment, across three core phases and ten detailed sub-scenarios. StuLife\nis designed around three key paradigm shifts: From Passive to Proactive, From\nContext to Memory, and From Imitation to Learning. In this dynamic environment,\nagents must acquire and distill practical skills and maintain persistent memory\nto make decisions based on evolving state variables. StuLife provides a\ncomprehensive platform for evaluating lifelong learning capabilities, including\nmemory retention, skill transfer, and self-motivated behavior. Beyond\nevaluating SOTA LLMs on the StuLife benchmark, we also explore the role of\ncontext engineering in advancing AGI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uacbd\ud5d8 \uae30\ubc18 \ud3c9\uc0dd \ud559\uc2b5(ELL) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \uc790\uac00 \uc9c4\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc \uc774\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c StuLife \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AI\uac00 \uc77c\ubc18 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc73c\ub85c \ubc1c\uc804\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \uc815\uc801 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub41c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \uac1c\ubc29\ud615 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc73c\ub85c \ucd08\uc810\uc774 \uc774\ub3d9\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uacbd\ud5d8 \uae30\ubc18 \ud3c9\uc0dd \ud559\uc2b5(ELL) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud575\uc2ec \uc6d0\uce59\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uc5ec \uc790\uc544 \uc9c4\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ub9cc\ub4dc\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "StuLife\ub294 \ud559\uc0dd\uc758 \uc804\uc778\uc801 \ub300\ud559 \uc5ec\uc815\uc744 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud558\ub294 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc73c\ub85c, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc2e4\uc81c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uae30\uc220\uc744 \uc2b5\ub4dd\ud558\uace0 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uae30\uc5b5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud574\uc57c \ud568\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 StuLife \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc2e0 LLMs\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0 AGI \ubc1c\uc804\uc5d0\uc11c \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uacf5\ud559\uc758 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "AI\uac00 \uc77c\ubc18 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc73c\ub85c \ubc1c\uc804\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \ucd08\uc810\uc740 \uc815\uc801 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub41c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \uac1c\ubc29\ud615 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\ub3d9\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uc131\uc7a5 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac16\ucd98 \uc790\uac00 \ubc1c\uc804 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 \uacbd\ud5d8 \uae30\ubc18 \ud3c9\uc0dd \ud559\uc2b5(ELL)\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud575\uc2ec \uc6d0\uce59\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uacbd\ud5d8 \ud0d0\uc0c9, \uc7a5\uae30 \uae30\uc5b5, \uae30\uc220 \ud559\uc2b5, \uc9c0\uc2dd \ub0b4\uc7ac\ud654. \ub354\ubd88\uc5b4, StuLife\ub77c\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \ud559\uc0dd\uc758 \uc804\uc778\uc801 \ub300\ud559 \uc5ec\uc815\uc744 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud558\uc5ec ELL\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

We propose a novel multimodal framework for financial risk\nassessment that integrates textual sentiment with paralinguistic cues derived\nfrom executive vocal tract dynamics in earnings calls. Central to this\nframework is the Physics-Informed Acoustic Model (PIAM), which applies\nnonlinear acoustics to robustly extract emotional signatures from raw\nteleconference sound subject to distortions such as signal clipping. Both\nacoustic and textual emotional states are projected onto an interpretable\nthree-dimensional Affective State Label (ASL) space-Tension, Stability, and\nArousal. Using a dataset of 1,795 earnings calls (approximately 1,800 hours),\nwe construct features capturing dynamic shifts in executive affect between\nscripted presentation and spontaneous Q&A exchanges. Our key finding reveals a\npronounced divergence in predictive capacity: while multimodal features do not\nforecast directional stock returns, they explain up to 43.8% of the\nout-of-sample variance in 30-day realized volatility. Importantly, volatility\npredictions are strongly driven by emotional dynamics during executive\ntransitions from scripted to spontaneous speech, particularly reduced textual\nstability and heightened acoustic instability from CFOs, and significant\narousal variability from CEOs. An ablation study confirms that our multimodal\napproach substantially outperforms a financials-only baseline, underscoring the\ncomplementary contributions of acoustic and textual modalities. By decoding\nlatent markers of uncertainty from verifiable biometric signals, our\nmethodology provides investors and regulators a powerful tool for enhancing\nmarket interpretability and identifying hidden corporate uncertainty.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uae08\uc735 \ub9ac\uc2a4\ud06c \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub378

Building on a prior human-led thematic analysis of 24 inpatients'\nlife-story interviews, we compared three LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4o, Google Gemini 2.5\nPro, Anthropic Claude Opus 4) prompted to mimic the interpretative style of the\noriginal investigators. The models were evaluated with blinded and non-blinded\nexpert judges in phenomenology and clinical psychology. Assessments included\nsemantic congruence, Jaccard coefficients, and multidimensional validity\nratings (credibility, coherence, substantiveness, and groundness in data).\nResults showed variable overlap with the human analysis, from 0 percent in GPT\nto 42 percent in Claude and 58 percent in Gemini, and a low Jaccard coefficient\n(0.21-0.28). However, the models recovered themes omitted by humans. Gemini's\noutput most closely resembled the human analysis, with validity scores\nsignificantly higher than GPT and Claude (p < 0.0001), and was judged as human\nby blinded experts. All scores strongly correlated (R > 0.78) with the quantity\nof text and words per theme, highlighting both the variability and potential of\nAI-augmented thematic analysis to mitigate human interpretative bias.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uacbd\uacc4\uc120 \uc778\uaca9\uc7a5\uc560(BPD)\uc758 1\uc778\uce6d \uacbd\ud5d8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud604\uc0c1\ud559\uc801 \uc9c8\uc801 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud588\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc778\uac04 \uc911\uc2ec \uc8fc\uc81c \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 LLM(GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude Opus 4)\uc744 \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc778\uac04 \ubd84\uc11d\uacfc\uc758 \uacb9\uce68\uc774 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc801\uc774\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "BPD\ub97c \uc2dc\uac04\uc131\uacfc \uc790\uc544\uc758 \uc7a5\uc560\ub85c \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0, LLM\uc774 \ud604\uc0c1\ud559\uc801 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud568.", "method": "24\uba85\uc758 \uc785\uc6d0 \ud658\uc790\uc758 \uc0dd\uc560 \uc774\uc57c\uae30 \uc778\ud130\ubdf0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc778\uac04 \uc8fc\ub3c4 \uc8fc\uc81c \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 LLM\uc758 \ud574\uc11d \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c\uc744 \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\ubd84\uc11d \uacb0\uacfc GPT\ub294 0%, Claude\ub294 42%, Gemini\ub294 58%\uc758 \uc778\uac04 \ubd84\uc11d\uacfc\uc758 \uacb9\uce68\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc73c\uba70, Jaccard \uacc4\uc218\ub294 \ub0ae\uc558\ub2e4(0.21-0.28).", "conclusion": "Gemini\uc758 \ucd9c\ub825\uc740 \uc778\uac04 \ubd84\uc11d\uacfc \uac00\uc7a5 \uc720\uc0ac\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, LLM\uc774 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \ud574\uc11d \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uacbd\uacc4\uc120 \uc778\uaca9\uc7a5\uc560(BPD)\uc758 1\uc778\uce6d \uacbd\ud5d8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud604\uc0c1\ud559\uc801 \uc9c8\uc801 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2dc\uac04\uc131\uacfc \uc790\uc544\uc758 \uc7a5\uc560\ub85c \uc774\ud574\ub418\ub294 BPD\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc778\uac04 \uc8fc\ub3c4 \uc8fc\uc81c \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc6d0\ub798 \uc870\uc0ac\uc790\uc758 \ud574\uc11d \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c\uc744 \ubaa8\ubc29\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc720\ub3c4\ub41c \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 LLM(OpenAI GPT-4o, Google Gemini 2.5 Pro, Anthropic Claude Opus 4)\uc744 \ube44\uad50\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ud604\uc0c1\ud559 \ubc0f \uc784\uc0c1 \uc2ec\ub9ac\ud559 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc758 \ube14\ub77c\uc778\ub4dc \ubc0f \ube44\ube14\ub77c\uc778\ub4dc \ud3c9\uac00\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0\ub294 \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \uc77c\uce58, \uc790\uce74\ub974\ub4dc \uacc4\uc218, \ub2e4\ucc28\uc6d0 \ud0c0\ub2f9\ub3c4 \uc810\uc218(\uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131, \uc77c\uad00\uc131, \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc131 \ubc0f \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uadfc\uac70)\uac00 \ud3ec\ud568\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 GPT\uc5d0\uc11c 0%, Claude\uc5d0\uc11c 42%, Gemini\uc5d0\uc11c 58%\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc778\uac04 \ubd84\uc11d\uacfc \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \uacb9\uce68\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uace0, \ub0ae\uc740 \uc790\uce74\ub974\ub4dc \uacc4\uc218(0.21-0.28)\ub97c \ubcf4\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc778\uac04\uc774 \uc0dd\ub7b5\ud55c \uc8fc\uc81c\ub97c \ubcf5\uc6d0\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Federated Learning (FL) offers a compelling solution through\nFederated Fine-Tuning (FFT), which enables collaborative model adaptation\nwithout sharing raw data. Recent approaches incorporate Parameter-Efficient\nFine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques such as Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to reduce\ncomputational overhead. However, LoRA-based FFT faces two major limitations in\nheterogeneous FL environments: structural incompatibility across clients with\nvarying LoRA configurations and limited adaptability to non-IID data\ndistributions, which hinders convergence and generalization. To address these\nchallenges, we propose FFT MoE, a novel FFT framework that replaces LoRA with\nsparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) adapters. Each client trains a lightweight\ngating network to selectively activate a personalized subset of experts,\nenabling fine-grained adaptation to local resource budgets while preserving\naggregation compatibility.

This study introduces the Approach of\nPassive Measures among Educands (APME), a reinforcement learning-based\nMulti-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework that estimates difficulty solely from solver\nperformance data -- marks obtained and time taken -- without requiring\nlinguistic features or expert labels. By leveraging the inverse coefficient of\nvariation as a risk-adjusted metric, the model provides an explainable and\nscalable mechanism for adaptive assessment. Empirical validation was conducted\non three heterogeneous datasets. Across these diverse contexts, the model\nachieved an average R2 of 0.9213 and an average RMSE of 0.0584, confirming its\nrobustness, accuracy, and adaptability to different educational levels and\nassessment formats. Compared with baseline approaches-such as regression-based,\nNLP-driven, and IRT models-the proposed framework consistently outperformed\nalternatives, particularly in purely symbolic domains. The findings highlight\nthat (i) item heterogeneity strongly influences perceived difficulty, and (ii)\nvariance in solver outcomes is as critical as mean performance for adaptive\nallocation. Pedagogically, the model aligns with Vygotskys Zone of Proximal\nDevelopment by identifying tasks that balance challenge and attainability,\nsupporting motivation while minimizing disengagement. This domain-agnostic,\nself-supervised approach advances difficulty tagging in IATS and can be\nextended beyond algebra wherever solver interaction data is available", "AI": {"tldr":

Existing methods focus on\nthe removed records and assume the retained ones are unaffected. However,\nrecent studies on the \\emph{privacy onion effect} indicate this assumption\nmight be incorrect. Especially when the model is differentially private, no\nstudy has explored whether the retained ones still meet the differential\nprivacy (DP) criterion under existing machine unlearning methods. This paper\ntakes a holistic approach to auditing both unlearned and retained samples'\nprivacy risks after applying approximate unlearning algorithms. We propose the\nprivacy criteria for unlearned and retained samples, respectively, based on the\nperspectives of DP and membership inference attacks (MIAs). To make the\nauditing process more practical, we also develop an efficient MIA, A-LiRA,\nutilizing data augmentation to reduce the cost of shadow model training. Our\nexperimental findings indicate that existing approximate machine unlearning\nalgorithms may inadvertently compromise the privacy of retained samples for\ndifferentially private models, and we need differentially private unlearning\nalgorithms.

Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, now standard in\nstate-of-the-art systems, introduce a new sparsity dimension that current\ndense-model frontiers overlook. We investigate how MoE sparsity influences two\ndistinct capability regimes: memorization and reasoning. We train families of\nMoE Transformers that systematically vary total parameters, active parameters,\nand top-$k$ routing while holding the compute budget fixed. For every model we\nrecord pre-training loss, downstream task loss, and task accuracy, allowing us\nto separate the train-test generalization gap from the loss-accuracy gap.\nMemorization benchmarks improve monotonically with total parameters, mirroring\ntraining loss. By contrast, reasoning performance saturates and can even\nregress despite continued gains in both total parameters and training loss.\nAltering top-$k$ alone has little effect when active parameters are constant,\nand classic hyperparameters such as learning rate and initialization modulate\nthe generalization gap in the same direction as sparsity. Neither post-training\nreinforcement learning (GRPO) nor extra test-time compute rescues the reasoning\ndeficit of overly sparse models.

This framework addresses long-standing difficulties in agent\narchitectures by letting intention emerge from language-mediated interactions\namong autonomous processes. This approach enables flexible, adaptive, and\ncontext-dependent behavior through the combination of concurrently executed\nmodules that offload reasoning to an LLM, inter-module communication, and a\nsingle shared global state.We consider this approach to be a practical\nrealization of Minsky's Society of Mind theory.

While post-training methods have improved\nLLM performance, they still fall short in capturing deep procedural logic on\ncomplex tasks. To tackle the issue, in this paper, we first investigate this\nlimitation and uncover a novel finding: a Scaling Law by Difficulty, which\nreveals that model performance follows a U-shaped curve with respect to\ntraining data complexity -- excessive low-difficulty data impedes abstraction,\nwhile high-difficulty data significantly enhances reasoning ability. Motivated\nby this, we propose the Structured Solution Template (SST) framework, which\nuses solution templates and a curriculum of varied difficulty to explicitly\nteach procedural reasoning. Specifically, SST comprises (1) fine-tuning with\nstructured solution-template chains and dynamically weighted loss to prioritize\nprocedural logic, (2) prompt-time injection of solution templates as cognitive\nscaffolds to guide inference, and (3) integrated curriculum fine-tuning that\nexplicitly teaches the model to self-plan - execute - self-correct. Experiments\non GSM8K, AIME24, and new Dynamic En benchmark show that SST significantly\nimproves both accuracy and efficiency, especially on harder problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc218\ud559\uc801 \uc808\ucc28\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158 \ud15c\ud50c\ub9bf(SST) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc218\ud559\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \uc131\ub2a5 \uac1c\uc120", "method": "\uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158 \ud15c\ud50c\ub9bf(SST) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc808\ucc28\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uac00\ub974\uce58\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860 \uac1c\ubc1c", "result": "SST\ub294 GSM8K, AIME24 \ubc0f \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 Dynamic En \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc640 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \ubaa8\ub450\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90c", "conclusion": "SST\ub294 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud2b9\ud788 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uad6c\uc870\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc808\ucc28\uc801\uc778 \ucd94\ub860\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc5d0\uc11c \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\uba70, \ud2b9\ud788 \uc218\ud559\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \uc0ac\ud6c4 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 LLM \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf30\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2ec\ud654\ub41c \uc808\ucc28\uc801 \ub17c\ub9ac\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uba3c\uc800 \uc774 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uace0 \ubaa8\ud615 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ud558\uc5ec U\uc790\ud615 \uace1\uc120\uc744 \ub530\ub978\ub2e4\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc1c\uacac\uc778 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1 \ubc95\uce59\uc744 \ubc1d\ud600\ub0b8\ub2e4. \uc9c0\ub098\uce58\uac8c \uc26c\uc6b4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub294 \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654\ub97c \uc800\ud574\ud558\uace0, \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub294 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4. \uc774\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158 \ud15c\ud50c\ub9bf(SST) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

We operate this\nRBIM at its Nishimori temperature, $\\beta_N$, where the smallest eigenvalue of\nthe Bethe-Hessian matrix vanishes, maximizing class separability.\n  Our theoretical contribution establishes a correspondence between local\ntrapping sets in the code's graph and topological invariants (Betti numbers,\nbordism classes) of the feature manifold. A practical algorithm estimates\n$\\beta_N$ efficiently with a quadratic interpolant and Newton correction,\nachieving a six-fold speed-up over bisection.\n  Guided by topology, we design spherical and toroidal MET-QC-LDPC graph\nensembles, using permanent bounds to suppress harmful trapping sets. This\ncompresses 1280-dimensional features to 32 or 64 dimensions for ImageNet-10 and\n-100 subsets. Despite massive compression (40x fewer parameters), we achieve\n98.7% accuracy on ImageNet-10 and 82.7% on ImageNet-100, demonstrating that\ntopology-guided graph design yields highly efficient, physics-inspired\nembeddings with state-of-the-art performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ubd84\ub958\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \ud1b5\uacc4\ubb3c\ub9ac\ud559, \ucf54\ub529 \uc774\ub860, \ub300\uc218\uc801 \uc704\uc0c1\uc218\ud559\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ubd84\ub958\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "MobileNetV2\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \ud2b9\uc9d5 \ubca1\ud130\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud76c\uc18c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5e3\uc9c0 \ud0c0\uc785\uc758 \uc900\uc8fc\uae30 LDPC \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2a4\ud540\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uc11d\ud558\uace0, Nishimori \uc628\ub3c4\uc5d0\uc11c RBIM\uc744 \uc6b4\uc601\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub137 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c 40\ubc30 \uc555\ucd95\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \ub192\uc740 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc704\uc0c1\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc548\ub0b4\ub41c \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc124\uacc4\ub294 \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud558\ub294 \uace0\ud6a8\uc728\uc758 \ubb3c\ub9ac\ud559 \uae30\ubc18 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ubd84\ub958\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \ud1b5\uacc4 \ubb3c\ub9ac\ud559, \ucf54\ub529 \uc774\ub860, \ub300\uc218\uc801 \uc704\uc0c1\uc218\ud559\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \ud2b9\uc9d5 \ubca1\ud130\ub294 \ud76c\uc18c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5e3\uc9c0 \ud0c0\uc785 \uc900\uc8fc\uae30 LDPC (MET-QC-LDPC) \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2a4\ud540\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uc11d\ub418\uba70, \ub79c\ub364 \ubcf8\ub4dc \uc774\uc9d5 \ubaa8\ub378(RBIM)\uc744 \ud615\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 RBIM\uc744 Nishimori \uc628\ub3c4 $\beta_N$\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b4\uc601\ud558\uc5ec Bethe-Hessian \ud589\ub82c\uc758 \uac00\uc7a5 \uc791\uc740 \uace0\uc720\uac12\uc774 0\uc774 \ub418\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \ud074\ub798\uc2a4 \ubd84\ub9ac\ub97c \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uae30\uc5ec\ub294 \ucf54\ub4dc\uc758 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc9c0\uc5ed \ud2b8\ub798\ud551 \uc9d1\ud569\uacfc \ud2b9\uc9d5 \ub9e4\ub2c8\ud3f4\ub4dc\uc758 \uc704\uc0c1 \ubd88\ubcc0\ub7c9(\ubca0\ud2f0 \uc218, \ubcf4\ub974\ub514\uc998 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4) \uac04\uc758 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ud655\ub9bd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\uc81c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \uc774\ucc28 \ubcf4\uac04\ubc95\uacfc \ub274\ud134 \ubcf4\uc815\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec $\beta_N$\uc744 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\uc815\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ubd84\ubc95\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc5ec\uc12f \ubc30\uc758 \uc18d\ub3c4 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uc774\ub8f9\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc704\uc0c1\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc778 MET-QC-LDPC \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uace0, \uc720\ud574\ud55c \ud2b8\ub798\ud551 \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \uc5b5\uc81c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc601\uad6c\uc131 \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub137-10 \ubc0f -100 \ud558\uc704 \uc9d1\ud569\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 1280\ucc28\uc6d0 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 32 \ub610\ub294 64 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc73c\ub85c \uc555\ucd95\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc555\ucd95\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0(40\ubc30 \uc801\uc740 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218) \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub137-10\uc5d0\uc11c 98.7%, \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub137-100\uc5d0\uc11c 82.7%\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc5ec, \uc704\uc0c1 \uc720\ub3c4 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc124\uacc4\uac00 \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uc131\ub2a5\uc758 \uace0\ud6a8\uc728 \ubb3c\ub9ac\ud559 \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc740 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Existing methods enhance LRMs by\nsequentially integrating external knowledge retrieval; models iteratively\ngenerate queries, retrieve external information, and progressively reason over\nthis information. However, purely sequential querying increases inference\nlatency and context length, diminishing coherence and potentially reducing\naccuracy. To address these limitations, we introduce HDS-QA (Hybrid Deep Search\nQA), a synthetic dataset automatically generated from Natural Questions,\nexplicitly designed to train LRMs to distinguish parallelizable from sequential\nqueries. HDS-QA comprises hybrid-hop questions that combine parallelizable\nindependent subqueries (executable simultaneously) and sequentially dependent\nsubqueries (requiring step-by-step resolution), along with synthetic\nreasoning-querying-retrieval paths involving parallel queries.

However, the decentralized nature of FL limits the\nvisibility of the training process, relying heavily on the honesty of\nparticipating clients. This assumption opens the door to malicious third\nparties, known as Byzantine clients, which can poison the training process by\nsubmitting false model updates. Such malicious clients may engage in poisoning\nattacks, manipulating either the dataset or the model parameters to induce\nmisclassification. In response, this study introduces FLAegis, a two-stage\ndefensive framework designed to identify Byzantine clients and improve the\nrobustness of FL systems. Our approach leverages symbolic time series\ntransformation (SAX) to amplify the differences between benign and malicious\nmodels, and spectral clustering, which enables accurate detection of\nadversarial behavior. Furthermore, we incorporate a robust FFT-based\naggregation function as a final layer to mitigate the impact of those Byzantine\nclients that manage to evade prior defenses. We rigorously evaluate our method\nagainst five poisoning attacks, ranging from simple label flipping to adaptive\noptimization-based strategies.

In\nthis work, we present the first theoretical framework for ACA with multiple\ncollectives acting on the same system.

Most existing model reduction methods are based on variable reduction,\nwhich predicts a solution value for a subset of variables. From a dual\nperspective, constraint reduction that transforms a subset of inequality\nconstraints into equalities can also reduce the complexity of MILP, but has\nbeen largely ignored. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel constraint-based\nmodel reduction approach for the MILP. Constraint-based MILP reduction has two\nchallenges: 1) which inequality constraints are critical such that reducing\nthem can accelerate MILP solving while preserving feasibility, and 2) how to\npredict these critical constraints efficiently. To identify critical\nconstraints, we first label these tight-constraints at the optimal solution as\npotential critical constraints and design a heuristic rule to select a subset\nof critical tight-constraints. To learn the critical tight-constraints, we\npropose a multi-modal representation technique that leverages information from\nboth instance-level and abstract-level MILP formulations. The experimental\nresults show that, compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our method\nimproves the quality of the solution by over 50\\% and reduces the computation\ntime by 17.47\\%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud63c\ud569 \uc815\uc218 \uc120\ud615 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d(MILP)\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc81c\uc57d \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378 \ucd95\uc18c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 50% \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158 \ud488\uc9c8 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uacfc 17.47%\uc758 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc2dc\uac04 \ub2e8\ucd95\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 MILP \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub354 \ube60\ub974\uac8c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6d0\ub798\uc758 MILP \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ubc30\uc6b0\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378 \ucd95\uc18c\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc81c\uc57d \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378 \ucd95\uc18c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc911\uc694 \uc81c\uc57d \uc870\uac74\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0, \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ud45c\ud604 \uae30\uc220\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc758 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 50% \uc774\uc0c1 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 17.47% \uc904\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc57d \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378 \ucd95\uc18c\uac00 MILP \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubaa8\ub378 \ucd95\uc18c\ub294 \uc6d0\ub798\uc758 \ud63c\ud569 \uc815\uc218 \uc120\ud615 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d(MILP)\uc758 simpler\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud558\uba70, \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 MILP \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud6e8\uc52c \ub354 \ube60\ub974\uac8c \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378 \ucd95\uc18c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ubcc0\uc218 \uac10\uc18c\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ubcc0\uc218\uc758 \ubd80\ubd84 \uc9d1\ud569\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158 \uac12\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc30d\ub300 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd80\ub4f1\uc2dd \uc81c\uc57d \uc870\uac74\uc758 \ubd80\ubd84 \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \ub4f1\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub294 \uc81c\uc57d \uc870\uac74 \uac10\uc18c\ub3c4 MILP\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \uc904\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub300\ubd80\ubd84 \ubb34\uc2dc\ub418\uc5b4\uc654\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 MILP\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc81c\uc57d \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378 \ucd95\uc18c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc57d \uae30\ubc18 MILP \ucd95\uc18c\uc5d0\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4: 1) \uc5b4\ub5a4 \ubd80\ub4f1\uc2dd \uc81c\uc57d \uc870\uac74\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub97c \uc904\uc774\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ud0c0\ub2f9\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c MILP \ud574\uacb0\uc744 \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\uc640 2) \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc81c\uc57d \uc870\uac74\uc744 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95. \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc81c\uc57d \uc870\uac74\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ucd5c\uc801 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uae34\ubc00\ud55c \uc81c\uc57d \uc870\uac74\uc744 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc81c\uc57d \uc870\uac74\uc73c\ub85c \ub808\uc774\ube14\uc744 \ubd99\uc774\uace0, \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uae34\ubc00\ud55c \uc81c\uc57d \uc870\uac74\uc758 \ubd80\ubd84 \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1 \uaddc\uce59\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uae34\ubc00\ud55c \uc81c\uc57d \uc870\uac74\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4 \uc218\uc900\uacfc \ucd94\uc0c1 \uc218\uc900\uc758 MILP \uc218\uc2dd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ud45c\ud604 \uae30\uc220\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\uc5d0 \ub530\ub974\uba74, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 50% \uc774\uc0c1 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 17.47% \ub2e8\ucd95\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4."}}

Memory-layer architectures offer an appealing\nalternative with very few memory access, but previous attempts like UltraMem\nhave only matched the performance of 2-expert MoE models, falling significantly\nshort of state-of-the-art 8-expert configurations. We present UltraMemV2, a\nredesigned memory-layer architecture that closes this performance gap. Our\napproach introduces five key improvements: integrating memory layers into every\ntransformer block, simplifying value expansion with single linear projections,\nadopting FFN-based value processing from PEER, implementing principled\nparameter initialization, and rebalancing memory-to-FFN computation ratios.\nThrough extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that UltraMemV2 achieves\nperformance parity with 8-expert MoE models under same computation and\nparameters but significantly low memory access. Notably, UltraMemV2 shows\nsuperior performance on memory-intensive tasks, with improvements of +1.6\npoints on long-context memorization, +6.2 points on multi-round memorization,\nand +7.9 points on in-context learning. We validate our approach at scale with\nmodels up to 2.5B activated parameters from 120B total parameters, and\nestablish that activation density has greater impact on performance than total\nsparse parameter count.

Our approach defines three compositional axes: Theme (e.g.,\nefficiency, adaptivity), Domain (e.g., question answering, machine\ntranslation), and Method (e.g., adversarial training, linear attention). These\nelements represent high-level abstractions common in scientific work -\nmotivations, problem settings, and technical approaches - and serve as building\nblocks for LLM-driven exploration. We mine elements from human experts or\nconference papers and show that prompting LLMs with curated combinations\nproduces research ideas that are diverse, relevant, and grounded in current\nliterature.

Existing oversight mechanisms are\nreactive, brittle, and embedded within agent architectures, making them\nnon-auditable and hard to generalize across heterogeneous deployments.\n  We introduce Governance-as-a-Service (GaaS): a modular, policy-driven\nenforcement layer that regulates agent outputs at runtime without altering\nmodel internals or requiring agent cooperation. GaaS employs declarative rules\nand a Trust Factor mechanism that scores agents based on compliance and\nseverity-weighted violations. It enables coercive, normative, and adaptive\ninterventions, supporting graduated enforcement and dynamic trust modulation.\n  To evaluate GaaS, we conduct three simulation regimes with open-source models\n(LLaMA3, Qwen3, DeepSeek-R1) across content generation and financial\ndecision-making. In the baseline, agents act without governance; in the second,\nGaaS enforces policies; in the third, adversarial agents probe robustness. All\nactions are intercepted, evaluated, and logged for analysis. Results show that\nGaaS reliably blocks or redirects high-risk behaviors while preserving\nthroughput. Trust scores track rule adherence, isolating and penalizing\nuntrustworthy components in multi-agent systems.\n  By positioning governance as a runtime service akin to compute or storage,\nGaaS establishes infrastructure-level alignment for interoperable agent\necosystems.

Inspired by recent advances, we reframe stepwise reward\nmodeling from a classification task to a reasoning task itself.

Furthermore, in the cases\nthey are, clients are assumed to be willing to share their entire label sets\nwith other clients. Federated learning with private label sets, shared only\nwith the central server, adds further constraints on learning algorithms and\nis, in general, a more difficult problem to solve. In this work, we study the\neffects of label set heterogeneity on model performance, comparing the public\nand private label settings -- when the union of label sets in the federation is\nknown to clients and when it is not. We apply classical methods for the\nclassifier combination problem to FL using centralized tuning, adapt common FL\nmethods to the private label set setting, and discuss the justification of both\napproaches under practical assumptions. Our experiments show that reducing the\nnumber of labels available to each client harms the performance of all methods\nsubstantially. Centralized tuning of client models for representational\nalignment can help remedy this, but often at the cost of higher variance.\nThroughout, our proposed adaptations of standard FL methods perform well,\nshowing similar performance in the private label setting as the standard\nmethods achieve in the public setting. This shows that clients can enjoy\nincreased privacy at little cost to model accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758

This survey\nprovides the first systematic investigation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP)\nas a unifying paradigm, highlighting its ability to bridge protocol-level\nadaptation with context-aware decision making. Analyzing established\nliterature, we show that existing efforts have implicitly converged toward\nMCP-like architectures, signaling a natural evolution from fragmented solutions\nto standardized integration frameworks. We propose a five-category taxonomy\ncovering adaptive mechanisms, context-aware frameworks, unification models,\nintegration strategies, and MCP-enabled architectures. Our findings reveal\nthree key insights: traditional transport protocols have reached the limits of\nisolated adaptation, MCP's client-server and JSON-RPC structure enables\nsemantic interoperability, and AI-driven transport demands integration\nparadigms uniquely suited to MCP.

Such bias can negatively affect model fairness,\nmodel generalization abilities and further risks amplifying social\ndiscrimination. There is a need to remove biases from trained models. Existing\ndebiasing approaches often necessitate access to original training data and\nneed extensive model retraining; they also typically exhibit trade-offs between\nmodel fairness and discriminative performance. To address these challenges, we\npropose Soft-Mask Weight Fine-Tuning (SWiFT), a debiasing framework that\nefficiently improves fairness while preserving discriminative performance with\nmuch less debiasing costs. Notably, SWiFT requires only a small external\ndataset and only a few epochs of model fine-tuning. The idea behind SWiFT is to\nfirst find the relative, and yet distinct, contributions of model parameters to\nboth bias and predictive performance. Then, a two-step fine-tuning process\nupdates each parameter with different gradient flows defined by its\ncontribution. Extensive experiments with three bias sensitive attributes\n(gender, skin tone, and age) across four dermatological and two chest X-ray\ndatasets demonstrate that SWiFT can consistently reduce model bias while\nachieving competitive or even superior diagnostic accuracy under common\nfairness and accuracy metrics, compared to the state-of-the-art.

This setup is well suited for implicit choices users\nmake when navigating a content platform, but does not capture other possible\ncomparison queries. Motivated by the fact that users provide more reliable\nfeedback after consuming items, we propose a new bandit model that can be\ndescribed as follows. The algorithm recommends one item per time step; after\nconsuming that item, the user is asked to compare it with another item chosen\nfrom the user's consumption history. Importantly, in our model, this comparison\nitem can be chosen without incurring any additional regret, potentially leading\nto better performance. However, the regret analysis is challenging because of\nthe temporal dependency in the user's history. To overcome this challenge, we\nfirst show that the algorithm can construct informative queries provided the\nhistory is rich, i.e., satisfies a certain diversity condition. We then show\nthat a short initial random exploration phase is sufficient for the algorithm\nto accumulate a rich history with high probability. This result, proven via\nmatrix concentration bounds, yields $O(\\sqrt{T})$ regret guarantees.\nAdditionally, our simulations show that reusing past items for comparisons can\nlead to significantly lower regret than only comparing between simultaneously\nrecommended items.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc120\ud638\ub3c4\ub97c \ubcf4\ub2e4

Recently, sharpness-aware minimization\nhas proven effective in transfer learning and has also been adopted in\ncontinual learning (CL) to improve memory retention and learning efficiency.\nHowever, relying on zeroth-order sharpness alone may favor sharper minima over\nflatter ones in certain settings, leading to less robust and potentially\nsuboptimal solutions. In this paper, we propose \\textbf{C}ontinual\n\\textbf{Flat}ness (\\textbf{C-Flat}), a method that promotes flatter loss\nlandscapes tailored for CL. C-Flat offers plug-and-play compatibility, enabling\neasy integration with minimal modifications to the code pipeline. Besides, we\npresent a general framework that integrates C-Flat into all major CL paradigms\nand conduct comprehensive comparisons with loss-minima optimizers and\nflat-minima-based CL methods. Our results show that C-Flat consistently\nimproves performance across a wide range of settings. In addition, we introduce\nC-Flat++, an efficient yet effective framework that leverages selective\nflatness-driven promotion, significantly reducing the update cost required by\nC-Flat. Extensive experiments across multiple CL methods, datasets, and\nscenarios demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed\napproaches.

However, both often\nlimit exploration on long-horizon tasks. We introduce History-Aggregated\nExploratory Policy Optimization (HAEPO), a history-aware exploratory loss to\ncombat these shortcomings. HAEPO compresses each trajectory into the sum of its\nlogarithmic probabilities (a cumulative logarithmic likelihood), and applies a\nPlackett-Luce softmax across trajectories to obtain normalized weights\nproportional to their returns, thus encouraging broader exploration. We add\nentropy regularization to stabilize the aggressive updates to prevent premature\ncollapse and a soft KL penalty relative to a frozen copy of the previous\n(reference) policy. Empirically, HAEPO converges fast, explores thoroughly,\naligns closely with true rewards, and demonstrates robust learning behavior\nbetter or at par with PPO, GRPO, and DPO across diverse tasks.

However, many existing Python libraries exhibit limitations in\nmodularity and in their native support for irregular, multi-source, or sparse\ndata. We introduce pyFAST, a research-oriented PyTorch framework that\nexplicitly decouples data processing from model computation, fostering a\ncleaner separation of concerns and facilitating rapid experimentation. Its data\nengine is engineered for complex scenarios, supporting multi-source loading,\nprotein sequence handling, efficient sequence- and patch-level padding, dynamic\nnormalization, and mask-based modeling for both imputation and forecasting.\npyFAST integrates LLM-inspired architectures for the alignment-free fusion of\nsparse data sources and offers native sparse metrics, specialized loss\nfunctions, and flexible exogenous data fusion.

The rise of large\nlanguage models (LLMs) has introduced new challenges in distributed systems, as\ntheir substantial computational requirements and the need for specialized\nexpertise raise critical concerns about protecting intellectual property (IP).\nThis highlights the need for a federated learning approach that can safeguard\nboth sensitive data and proprietary models. To tackle this challenge, we\npropose FedQSN, a federated learning approach that leverages random masking to\nobscure a subnetwork of model parameters and applies quantization to the\nremaining parameters. Consequently, the server transmits only a\nprivacy-preserving proxy of the global model to clients during each\ncommunication round, thus enhancing the model's confidentiality. Experimental\nresults across various models and tasks demonstrate that our approach not only\nmaintains strong model performance in federated learning settings but also\nachieves enhanced protection of model parameters compared to baseline methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc8fc\ub41c \ubaa9\ud45c\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc\ub97c \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774\uba70, \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud53c\uc5b4 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubc0f \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\ub294 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc778 FedQSN\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ucd9c\ud604\uc73c\ub85c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc \ubc0f \uc9c0\uc801 \uc7ac\uc0b0 \ubcf4\ud638\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc6b0\ub824\uac00 \uc99d\ub300\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "method": "FedQSN\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\uc758 \uc11c\ube0c\ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub79c\ub364 \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud0b9\ud558\uace0 \ub098\uba38\uc9c0 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uc591\uc790\ud654\ub97c \uc801\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ubcf8 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba70, \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ubaa8\ub378 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \ubcf4\ud638\ub97c \uac15\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "FedQSN\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubc0f \uc9c0\uc801 \uc7ac\uc0b0\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ubcf4\ud638\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub294 \uc6d0\uc2dc \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ub85c\uceec \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ubd84\uc0b0\uc2dc\ucf1c \ub450\uba74\uc11c \uacf5\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uacf5\uc720 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uad50\uc721\ud558\uc5ec \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc\ub97c \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4. \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \ucd9c\ud604\uc740 \uadf8\ub4e4\uc758 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc694\uad6c\uc0ac\ud56d\uacfc \uc804\ubb38 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc758 \ud544\uc694\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc9c0\uc801 \uc7ac\uc0b0(IP) \ubcf4\ud638\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc6b0\ub824\ub97c \uc81c\uae30\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \ub3c5\uc810 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ubaa8\ub450 \ubcf4\ud638\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\uc758 \uc11c\ube0c\ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc228\uae30\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub79c\ub364 \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud0b9\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uace0 \ub098\uba38\uc9c0 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\uc5d0\ub294 \uc591\uc790\ud654\ub97c \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc778 FedQSN\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uc11c\ubc84\ub294 \uac01 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ub77c\uc6b4\ub4dc \ub3d9\uc548 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\uc5d0\uac8c \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc\ub97c \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub85d\uc2dc\ub9cc \uc804\uc1a1\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uae30\ubc00\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc774 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud560 \ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uae30\uc900 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ubaa8\ub378 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\uc758 \ubcf4\ud638\ub97c \uac15\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4."}}

Previous research primarily focused on the linear\ncase for the dynamics function in neural ODEs - Marion, P.

In this work, we analyze a broader class of neural\nODEs where the dynamics function is a general nonlinear function, either time\ndependent or time independent, and is Lipschitz continuous with respect to the\nstate variables. We showed that under this Lipschitz condition, the solutions\nto neural ODEs have solutions with bounded variations. Based on this\nobservation, we establish generalization bounds for both time-dependent and\ntime-independent cases and investigate how overparameterization and domain\nconstraints influence these bounds.

It has crucial\nbiological applications, such as molecular docking, protein folding, and\nmolecular design.

In this work, we focus on flow\nmatching and adopt an energy-based perspective to improve training and\ninference of structure generation models. Our view results in a mapping\nfunction, represented by a deep network, that is directly learned to\n\\textit{iteratively} map random configurations, i.e. samples from the source\ndistribution, to target structures, i.e. points in the data manifold. This\nyields a conceptually simple and empirically effective flow matching setup that\nis theoretically justified and has interesting connections to fundamental\nproperties such as idempotency and stability, as well as the empirically useful\ntechniques such as structure refinement in AlphaFold. Experiments on protein\ndocking as well as protein backbone generation consistently demonstrate the\nmethod's effectiveness, where it outperforms recent baselines of\ntask-associated flow matching and diffusion models, using a similar\ncomputational budget.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubd84\uc790\uc758 3D \uad6c\uc870 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uae30\ubc18 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uad6c\uc870 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud6c8\ub828\uacfc \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubd84\uc790\uc758 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\uc758 3D \uc704\uce58\ub97c \uacb0\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801 \uc751\uc6a9, \ud2b9\ud788 \ubd84\uc790 \ub3c4\ud0b9 \ubc0f \ub2e8\ubc31\uc9c8 \uc811\ud798\uc5d0 \uacb0\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uacfc\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud750\ub984 \ub9e4\uce6d\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uace0 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uae30\ubc18 \uad00\uc810\uc744 \ucc44\ud0dd\ud558\uc5ec \uad6c\uc870 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud6c8\ub828\uacfc \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uae4a\uc740 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c \ud45c\ud604\ub418\ub294 \ub9e4\ud551 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \uc9c1\uc811 \ud559\uc2b5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ub2e8\ubc31\uc9c8 \ub3c4\ud0b9 \ubc0f \ub2e8\ubc31\uc9c8 \ubc31\ubcf8 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc784\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uba70, \ucd5c\uadfc\uc758 \ud750\ub984 \ub9e4\uce6d \ubc0f \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ucd08\uc6d4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\ub2f9\ud654\ub418\ub294 \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \ud750\ub984 \ub9e4\uce6d \uc124\uc815\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \ubd84\uc790 \uad6c\uc870 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c \uc790\ub9ac \uc7a1\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubd84\uc790 \uad6c\uc870 \uc0dd\uc131\uc740 \ubd84\uc790\uc758 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\uc758 3D \uc704\uce58\ub97c \uacb0\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ubb38\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ubd84\uc790 \ub3c4\ud0b9, \ub2e8\ubc31\uc9c8 \uc811\ud798 \ubc0f \ubd84\uc790 \uc124\uacc4\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801 \uc751\uc6a9\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc\uc758 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804, \ud2b9\ud788 \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ud750\ub984 \ub9e4\uce6d\uc740 \ubd84\uc790 \ud615\ud0dc\ub97c \ubd84\ud3ec\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ud070 \uc9c4\uc804\uc744 \uac00\uc838\uc654\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud750\ub984 \ub9e4\uce6d\uc5d0 \uc911\uc810\uc744 \ub450\uace0 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uad00\uc810\uc744 \ucc44\ud0dd\ud558\uc5ec \uad6c\uc870 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubc0f \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uad00\uc810\uc740 \uc784\uc758\uc758 \uad6c\uc131(\uc989, \uc18c\uc2a4 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0d8\ud50c)\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c \uad6c\uc870(\uc989, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ub9e4\ub2c8\ud3f4\ub4dc\uc758 \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8)\ub85c \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub9e4\ud551\ud558\ub294 \uc2ec\uce35 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c \ud45c\ud604\ub418\ub294 \ub9e4\ud551 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\ub2f9\ud654\ub418\uace0 \uc544\uc774\ub3c4\ud3ec\ud134\uc2dc \ubc0f \uc548\uc815\uc131\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uae30\ubcf8\uc801 \ud2b9\uc131\ubfd0 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c AlphaFold\uc758 \uad6c\uc870 \uc815\uc81c\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c \uae30\uc220\ub4e4\uacfc \ud765\ubbf8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc5f0\uacb0\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \uac1c\ub150\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac04\ub2e8\ud558\uace0 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ud750\ub984 \ub9e4\uce6d \uc124\uc815\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e8\ubc31\uc9c8 \ub3c4\ud0b9 \ubc0f \ub2e8\ubc31\uc9c8 \ubc31\ubcf8 \uc0dd\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc740 \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc608\uc0b0\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc791\uc5c5 \uad00\ub828 \ud750\ub984 \ub9e4\uce6d \ubc0f \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ucd5c\uadfc \uae30\uc900\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Park", "Jesse Read"], "title": "Estimating Conditional Covariance between labels for Multilabel Data", "comment": null, "summary": "Multilabel data should be analysed for label dependence before applying\nmultilabel models. Independence between multilabel data labels cannot be\nmeasured directly from the label values due to their dependence on the set of\ncovariates $\\vec{x}$, but can be measured by examining the conditional label\ncovariance using a multivariate Probit model. Unfortunately, the multivariate\nProbit model provides an estimate of its copula covariance, and so might not be\nreliable in estimating constant covariance and dependent covariance. In this\narticle, we compare three models (Multivariate Probit, Multivariate Bernoulli\nand Staged Logit) for estimating the constant and dependent multilabel\nconditional label covariance.

Using the Lorenz system as a testbed, we propose\na three-stage methodology: learning Koopman embeddings through autoencoding,\npre-training a transformer on next-state prediction, and fine-tuning for\nsafety-critical control. Our results show that Koopman embeddings outperform\nboth standard and physics-informed PCA baselines, achieving accurate and\ndata-efficient performance. Notably, fixing the pre-trained transformer weights\nduring fine-tuning leads to no performance degradation, indicating that the\nlearned representations capture reusable dynamical structure rather than\ntask-specific patterns.

Modern forecasting models are generally opaque and do\nnot provide explanations for their forecasts, while well-known post-hoc\nexplainability methods like LIME are not suitable for the forecasting context.\nWe propose PAX-TS, a model-agnostic post-hoc algorithm to explain time series\nforecasting models and their forecasts. Our method is based on localized input\nperturbations and results in multi-granular explanations. Further, it is able\nto characterize cross-channel correlations for multivariate time series\nforecasts. We clearly outline the algorithmic procedure behind PAX-TS,\ndemonstrate it on a benchmark with 7 algorithms and 10 diverse datasets,\ncompare it with two other state-of-the-art explanation algorithms, and present\nthe different explanation types of the method. We found that the explanations\nof high-performing and low-performing algorithms differ on the same datasets,\nhighlighting that the explanations of PAX-TS effectively capture a model's\nbehavior. Based on time step correlation matrices resulting from the benchmark,\nwe identify 6 classes of patterns that repeatedly occur across different\ndatasets and algorithms. We found that the patterns are indicators of\nperformance, with noticeable differences in forecasting error between the\nclasses. Lastly, we outline a multivariate example where PAX-TS demonstrates\nhow the forecasting model takes cross-channel correlations into account. With\nPAX-TS, time series forecasting models' mechanisms can be illustrated in\ndifferent levels of detail, and its explanations can be used to answer\npractical questions on forecasts.", "AI":

This method focuses on sharing only\nclass-representative prototypes among heterogeneous clients. However, these\nprototypes are often aggregated on the server using weighted averaging, leading\nto sub-optimal global knowledge; these cause the shrinking of aggregated\nprototypes, which negatively affects the model performance in scenarios when\nmodels are heterogeneous and data distributions are extremely non-IID. We\npropose FedProtoKD in a Heterogeneous Federated Learning setting, using an\nenhanced dual-knowledge distillation mechanism to improve the system\nperformance with clients' logits and prototype feature representation. We aim\nto resolve the prototype margin-shrinking problem using a contrastive\nlearning-based trainable server prototype by leveraging a class-wise adaptive\nprototype margin. Furthermore, we assess the importance of public samples using\nthe closeness of the sample's prototype to its class representative prototypes,\nwhich enhances learning performance. FedProtoKD achieved average improvements\nof 1.13% up to 34.13% accuracy across various settings and significantly\noutperforms existing state-of-the-art HFL methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c FedProtoKD\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131\uacfc \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub824\uace0 \ud55c\ub2e4.

This assumption often fails in\nindustrial systems, where dynamics are driven by control actions, are highly\nnon-stationary, and can experience long, uninterrupted gaps. We propose STDiff,\nwhich reframes imputation as learning how the system evolves from one state to\nthe next. STDiff uses a conditional denoising diffusion model with a causal\nbias aligned to control theory, generating missing values step-by-step based on\nthe most recent known state and relevant control or environmental inputs. On a\npublic wastewater treatment dataset with simulated missing blocks, STDiff\nconsistently achieves the lowest errors, with its advantage increasing for\nlonger gaps. On a raw industrial dataset with substantial real gaps, it\nproduces trajectories that remain dynamically plausible, in contrast to\nwindow-based models that tend to flatten or over-smooth.

Here, we aim to study a simple dynamical\nsystem composed of springs and sticks capable of arbitrarily approximating any\ncontinuous function. The main idea of our work is to use the sticks to mimic a\npiecewise-linear approximation of the given function, use the potential energy\nof springs to encode a desired mean squared error loss function, and converge\nto a minimum-energy configuration via dissipation. We apply the proposed\nsimulation system to regression tasks and show that its performance is\ncomparable to that of multi-layer perceptrons. In addition, we study the\nthermodynamic properties of the system and find a relation between the free\nenergy change of the system and its ability to learn an underlying data\ndistribution. We empirically find a \\emph{thermodynamic learning barrier} for\nthe system caused by the fluctuations of the environment, whereby the system\ncannot learn if its change in free energy hits such a barrier.

To address these issues, we propose a novel active\nlearning-based anomaly detection framework that leverages similarity search to\niteratively refine the decision space. Built upon an Attention-Based\nAutoencoder, our approach uses feature-space similarity to identify normal-like\nand anomaly-like instances, thereby enhancing model robustness with minimal\noracle supervision.

These models often suffer\nfrom overfitting, leading to a decline in predictive performance on unseen\ndata. A standard solution is early stopping using a hold-out validation set,\nwhich halts the minimisation when the validation loss stops decreasing.\nHowever, this hold-out set reduces the data available for training. This paper\npresents GRADSTOP, a novel stochastic early stopping method that only uses\ninformation in the gradients, which are produced by the gradient descent\nalgorithm ``for free.'' Our main contributions are that we estimate the\nBayesian posterior by the gradient information, define the early stopping\nproblem as drawing sample from this posterior, and use the approximated\nposterior to obtain a stopping criterion. Our empirical evaluation shows that\nGRADSTOP achieves a small loss on test data and compares favourably to a\nvalidation-set-based stopping criterion. By leveraging the entire dataset for\ntraining, our method is particularly advantageous in data-limited settings,\nsuch as transfer learning. It can be incorporated as an optional feature in\ngradient descent libraries with only a small computational overhead.

In this paper, we dive deeper into one of such\nbenchmarks: associative recall (AR), which has been shown to correlate well\nwith language modeling performance, and inspect in detail the effects of\nscaling and optimization issues in recently proposed token mixing strategies.\nWe first demonstrate that, unlike standard transformers, the choice of learning\nrate plays a critical role in the performance of modern recurrent models: an\nissue that can severely affect reported performance in previous works and\nsuggests further research is needed to stabilize training.

We then further inspect 1-layer transformers,\nrevealing that despite their poor performance, their training dynamics\nsurprisingly resemble the formation of induction heads, a phenomenon previously\nobserved only in their 2-layer counterparts.

They are essential for structural analysis, seismic design, and\nseismic risk assessment studies. Traditional machine learning (ML) approaches\nare popular to develop GMMs, due to large earthquake databases worldwide.\nHowever, they operate as \"black boxes,\" which are hard to interpret and trust,\nlimiting their use in high-stake decisions. Additionally, these databases\nsuffer from significant data imbalances: fewer large, critically damaging\nrecords near the fault compared to abundant, less severely damaging distant\nrecords. These two limitations are addressed in this work by developing a\ntransparent ML architecture using the HazBinLoss function. Each input (e.g.,\nmagnitude, distance, their interaction term, etc.) is processed separately and\nadded linearly to obtain the output, resulting in exact contribution of each\nterm. The HazBinLoss function assigns higher weights to critical near-field\nlarge magnitude records and lower weights to less-critical far-field smaller\nmagnitude records, during training to prevent underprediction of the most\ndamaging scenarios.

However, their ability to extrapolate beyond their training\ndomain (\\textit{e.g.} larger or structurally different graphs) remains\nuncertain. In this work, we establish that GNNs can serve purposes beyond their\ntraditional role, and be exploited to generate numerical schemes, in\nconjunction with symbolic regression. First, we show numerically and\ntheoretically that a GNN trained on a dataset consisting solely of two-node\ngraphs can extrapolate a first-order Finite Volume (FV) scheme for the heat\nequation on out-of-distribution, unstructured meshes. Specifically, if a GNN\nachieves a loss $\\varepsilon$ on such a dataset, it implements the FV scheme\nwith an error of $\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon)$. Using symbolic regression, we show\nthat the network effectively rediscovers the exact analytical formulation of\nthe standard first-order FV scheme. We then extend this approach to an\nunsupervised context: the GNN recovers the first-order FV scheme using only a\nresidual loss similar to Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) with no\naccess to ground-truth data. Finally, we push the methodology further by\nconsidering higher-order schemes: we train (i) a 2-hop and (ii) a 2-layers GNN\nusing the same PINN loss, that autonomously discover (i) a second-order\ncorrection term to the initial scheme using a 2-hop stencil, and (ii) the\nclassic second-order midpoint scheme. These findings follows a recent paradigm\nin scientific computing: GNNs are not only strong approximators, but can be\nactive contributors to the development of novel numerical methods.", "AI":

This work introduces an efficient Federated Unlearning framework\nbased on information theory, modeling leakage as a parameter estimation\nproblem. Our method uses second-order Hessian information to identify and\nselectively reset only the parameters most sensitive to the data being\nforgotten, followed by minimal federated retraining. This model-agnostic\napproach supports categorical and client unlearning without requiring server\naccess to raw client data after initial information aggregation. Evaluations on\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate strong privacy (MIA success near random,\ncategorical knowledge erased) and high performance (Normalized Accuracy against\nre-trained benchmarks of $\\approx$ 0.9), while aiming for increased efficiency\nover complete retraining.

Quantization methods can help reduce computational costs, however,\nattaining the extreme efficiency associated with ultra-low-bit quantized LLMs\nat arbitrary precision presents challenges on GPUs. This is primarily due to\nthe limited support for GPU Tensor Cores, inefficient memory management, and\ninflexible kernel optimizations. To tackle these challenges, we propose a\ncomprehensive acceleration scheme for arbitrary precision LLMs, namely APT-LLM.\nFirstly, we introduce a novel data format, bipolar-INT, which allows for\nefficient and lossless conversion with signed INT, while also being more\nconducive to parallel computation. We also develop a matrix multiplication\n(MatMul) method allowing for arbitrary precision by dismantling and\nreassembling matrices at the bit level. This method provides flexible precision\nand optimizes the utilization of GPU Tensor Cores. In addition, we propose a\nmemory management system focused on data recovery, which strategically employs\nfast shared memory to substantially increase kernel execution speed and reduce\nmemory access latency. Finally, we develop a kernel mapping method that\ndynamically selects the optimal configurable hyperparameters of kernels for\nvarying matrix sizes, enabling optimal performance across different LLM\narchitectures and precision settings.

To improve the quality of\ngenerated samples and their compliance with user requirements, two commonly\nused methods are: (i) Alignment, which involves fine-tuning a diffusion model\nto align it with a reward; and (ii) Composition, which combines several\npre-trained diffusion models, each emphasizing a desirable attribute in the\ngenerated outputs. However, trade-offs often arise when optimizing for multiple\nrewards or combining multiple models, as they can often represent competing\nproperties. Existing methods cannot guarantee that the resulting model\nfaithfully generates samples with all the desired properties. To address this\ngap, we propose a constrained optimization framework that unifies alignment and\ncomposition of diffusion models by enforcing that the aligned model satisfies\nreward constraints and/or remains close to (potentially multiple) pre-trained\nmodels. We provide a theoretical characterization of the solutions to the\nconstrained alignment and composition problems and develop a Lagrangian-based\nprimal-dual training algorithm to approximate these solutions. Empirically, we\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and merits of our proposed approach in image\ngeneration, applying it to alignment and composition, and show that our aligned\nor composed model satisfies constraints effectively, and improves on the\nequally-weighted approach.

However, its effectiveness is often\nlimited by the high cost and low availability of reliable human input,\nespecially in domains where expert feedback is scarce or errors are costly. To\naddress this, we propose a novel framework that combines two complementary\nstrategies: probabilistic crowd modelling to handle noisy, multi-annotator\nfeedback, and active learning to prioritize feedback on the most informative\nagent actions. We extend the Advise algorithm to support multiple trainers,\nestimate their reliability online, and incorporate entropy-based query\nselection to guide feedback requests.

We study a DAM\nbuilt upon a three-layer Boltzmann machine with Potts hidden units, which\nrepresent data clusters and classes. Through a statistical mechanics analysis,\nwe derive saddle-point equations that characterize both the stationary points\nof DAMs trained on real data and the fixed points of DAMs trained on synthetic\ndata within a teacher-student framework. Based on these results, we propose a\nnovel regularization scheme that makes training significantly more stable.\nMoreover, we show empirically that our DAM learns interpretable solutions to\nboth supervised and unsupervised classification problems. Pushing our\ntheoretical analysis further, we find that the weights learned by relatively\nsmall DAMs correspond to unstable saddle points in larger DAMs. We implement a\nnetwork-growing algorithm that leverages this saddle-point hierarchy to\ndrastically reduce the computational cost of training dense associative memory.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \ubc00\uc9d1 \uc5f0\uc0c1 \uae30\uc5b5(DAM) \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \ub354 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub9cc\ub4e4\uace0, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubc00\uc9d1 \uc5f0\uc0c1 \uae30\uc5b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uacf5\uc801 \uc608\uc81c\uc5d0 \uac15\uc778\ud558\uba70 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uacfc \ubc00\uc811\ud558\uac8c \uad00\ub828\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \uc7ac\uc870\uba85\ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud3ec\uce20 \uc228\uaca8\uc9c4 \uc720\ub2db\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 3\uce35 \ubcfc\uce20\ub9cc \uae30\uacc4\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c DAM\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \ud1b5\uacc4 \uc5ed\ud559 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uad00\ub828\ub41c \uc138\ub4e4\ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8 \ubc29\uc815\uc2dd\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \uae30\ubc95 \ub355\ubd84\uc5d0 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc774 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, DAM\uc774 \uac10\ub3c5 \ubc0f \ube44\uac10\ub3c5 \ubd84\ub958 \ubb38\uc81c \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc0c1\ub300\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\uc740 DAM\uc774 \ud559\uc2b5\ud55c \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub294 \ub354 \ud070 DAM\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd88\uc548\uc815\ud55c \uc138\ub4e4\ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ud574\ub2f9\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubc00\uc9d1 \uc5f0\uc0c1 \uae30\uc5b5(DAM) \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc608\uc81c\uc5d0 \uac15\uc778\ud558\uace0 \ud2b8\ub79c\uc2a4\ud3ec\uba38\uc758 \uc8fc\uc758 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998 \ubc0f \uc0dd\uc131 \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uacfc \ubc00\uc811\ud558\uac8c \uad00\ub828\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc2dc \uc8fc\ubaa9\ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130\uc640 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\ub294 \ud3ec\uce20 \uc228\uaca8\uc9c4 \uc720\ub2db\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 3\uce35 \ubcfc\uce20\ub9cc \uae30\uacc4\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c DAM\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud1b5\uacc4 \uc5ed\ud559 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c DAM\uc758 \uc815\uc801 \uc9c0\uc810\uacfc \ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c DAM\uc758 \uace0\uc815 \uc9c0\uc810\uc744 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc9d3\ub294 \uc138\ub4e4\ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8 \ubc29\uc815\uc2dd\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \ub354 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub9cc\ub4dc\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \ubc29\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uac8c\ub2e4\uac00, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 DAM\uc774 \uac10\ub3c5 \ubc0f \ube44\uac10\ub3c5 \ubd84\ub958 \ubb38\uc81c \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4. \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ub354 \uc9c4\ud589\ud558\uc5ec \uc0c1\ub300\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\uc740 DAM\uc774 \ud559\uc2b5\ud55c \uac00\uc911\uce58\uac00 \ub354 \ud070 DAM\uc758 \ubd88\uc548\uc815\ud55c \uc138\ub4e4\ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ud574\ub2f9\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \uc138\ub4e4\ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8 \uacc4\uce35 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubc00\uc9d1 \uc5f0\uc0c1 \uae30\uc5b5\uc758 \ud6c8\ub828 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \ub300\ud3ed \uc904\uc774\ub294 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uc131\uc7a5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uad6c\ud604\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

Existing pre-deployment robustness\nassessment methods typically suffer from significant trade-offs between\ncomputational cost and measurement precision, limiting their practical utility.\nTo address these limitations, this paper conducts a comprehensive comparative\nanalysis of existing robustness definitions and associated assessment\nmethodologies. We propose tower robustness to evaluate robustness, which is a\nnovel, practical metric based on hypothesis testing to quantitatively evaluate\nprobabilistic robustness, enabling more rigorous and efficient pre-deployment\nassessments. Our extensive comparative evaluation illustrates the advantages\nand applicability of our proposed approach, thereby advancing the systematic\nunderstanding and enhancement of model robustness in safety-critical deep\nlearning applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc548\uc804-critical \ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 \ud0c0\uc6cc \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\ub294 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \ube44\uad50 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc548\uc804-critical \ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c \uc785\ub825 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ubbf8\uc138\ud55c \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e0\uacbd \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud0c0\uc6cc \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc774\ub780, \uac00\uc124 \uac80\uc815\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801 \uc9c0\ud45c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \uc815\ub7c9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \ube44\uad50 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \uc7a5\uc810\uacfc \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc548\uc804-critical \ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa8\ub378 \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ub370 \uae30\uc5ec\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc548\uc804-critical \ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc740 \uc785\ub825 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ubbf8\uc138\ud55c \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \ub300\ucc98\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc2e0\uacbd \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uce21\uc815\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubcc0\ud654\ub294 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801\uc778 \uc548\uc804 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc0ac\uc804 \ubc30\ud3ec \uac15\uac74\uc131 \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ub300\uac1c \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uacfc \uce21\uc815 \uc815\ubc00\ub3c4 \uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc0c1\ucda9\uad00\uacc4\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801 \ud65c\uc6a9\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uae30\uc874 \uac15\uac74\uc131 \uc815\uc758\uc640 \uad00\ub828\ub41c \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \ube44\uad50 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud0c0\uc6cc \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \uc815\ub7c9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uac00\uc124 \uac80\uc815\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801 \uc9c0\ud45c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc0ac\uc804 \ubc30\ud3ec \ud3c9\uac00\uac00 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud558\uace0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc9c8 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \ube44\uad50 \ud3c9\uac00\ub294 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \uc7a5\uc810\uacfc \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5b4, \uc548\uc804-critical \ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa8\ub378 \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ub370 \uae30\uc5ec\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Motivated by\nthis gap in the literature, in this paper we introduce ambiguity-aware ordinal\nemotion representations, a novel framework that captures both the ambiguity\npresent in emotion annotation and the inherent temporal dynamics of emotional\ntraces. Specifically, we propose approaches that model emotion ambiguity\nthrough its rate of change. We evaluate our framework on two affective corpora\n-- RECOLA and GameVibe -- testing our proposed approaches on both bounded\n(arousal, valence) and unbounded (engagement) continuous traces. Our results\ndemonstrate that ordinal representations outperform conventional\nambiguity-aware models on unbounded labels, achieving the highest Concordance\nCorrelation Coefficient (CCC) and Signed Differential Agreement (SDA) scores,\nhighlighting their effectiveness in modeling the traces' dynamics. For bounded\ntraces, ordinal representations excel in SDA, revealing their superior ability\nto capture relative changes of annotated emotion traces.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uac10\uc815 \uc778\uc2dd\uc758 \ubaa8\ud638\uc131\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uac10\uc815\uc758 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uc18d \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ub2a5\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uac10\uc815 \uc778\uc2dd \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uac10\uc815\uc758 \ubaa8\ud638\uc131\uc744 \ubb34\uc2dc\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc815\uc801 \ubcc0\uc218\ub85c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \ube48\ud2c8\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubaa8\ud638\uc131\uc744 \ubcc0\ud654\uc728\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \uc21c\uc11c\uc801 \uac10\uc815 \ud45c\ud604 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "RECOLA\uc640 GameVibe \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \uac10\uc815 \ucf54\ud37c\uc2a4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, \uc21c\uc11c\uc801 \ud45c\ud604\uc774 \ubb34\ud55c \ub77c\ubca8\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub192\uc740 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc815\uc801 \ub77c\ubca8\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 SDA\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70 \uac10\uc815\uc758 \uc0c1\ub300\uc801 \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \uc798 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud568\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac10\uc815\uc740 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ud638\ud558\uace0 \uc5ed\ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \ud604\uc0c1\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc5f0\uc18d \uac10\uc815 \uc778\uc2dd \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \ubaa8\ud638\uc131\uc744 \ubb34\uc2dc\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc2dc\uac04\uc774 \uc9c0\ub0a8\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ubaa8\ud638\uc131\uc744 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc815\uc801 \ubcc0\uc218\ub85c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\ud5cc\uc758 \uac04\uadf9\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ub3d9\uae30\ubd80\uc5ec\ub418\uc5b4, \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uac10\uc815 \uc8fc\uc11d\uc758 \ubaa8\ud638\uc131\uacfc \uac10\uc815 \ud754\uc801\uc758 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \uc5ed\ub3d9\uc131\uc744 \ubaa8\ub450 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 \ubaa8\ud638\uc131 \uc778\uc2dd \uc21c\uc11c\uc801 \uac10\uc815 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac10\uc815\uc758 \ubcc0\ud654\uc728\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uac10\uc815\uc758 \ubaa8\ud638\uc131\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 RECOLA\uc640 GameVibe\ub77c\ub294 \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \uc815\uc11c\uc801 \ucf54\ud37c\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0, \uacbd\uacc4\uac00 \uc788\ub294(\uac01\uc131, \uac00\uce58) \ubc0f \uacbd\uacc4\uac00 \uc5c6\ub294(\ucc38\uc5ec) \uc5f0\uc18d \ud754\uc801\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc21c\uc11c\uc801 \ud45c\ud604\uc774 \uacbd\uacc4\uac00 \uc5c6\ub294 \ub77c\ubca8\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubaa8\ud638\uc131 \uc778\uc2dd \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uac00\uc7a5 \ub192\uc740 \uc77c\uce58 \uc0c1\uad00 \uacc4\uc218(CCC)\uc640 \uc11c\uba85\ub41c \ucc28\ubcc4 \ud569\uc758(SDA) \uc810\uc218\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \ud754\uc801\uc758 \uc5ed\ub3d9\uc131\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc784\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacbd\uacc4\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \ud754\uc801\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0, \uc21c\uc11c\uc801 \ud45c\ud604\uc774 SDA\uc5d0\uc11c \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70 \uc8fc\uc11d\ub41c \uac10\uc815 \ud754\uc801\uc758 \uc0c1\ub300\uc801 \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

We argue\nthat MTP's exact future token prediction is too difficult as an auxiliary loss.\nInstead, we propose Token Order Prediction (TOP), which trains models to order\nupcoming tokens by their proximity using a learning-to-rank loss. TOP requires\nonly a single additional unembedding layer compared to MTP's multiple\ntransformer layers. We pretrain models of 340M, 1.8B, and 7B parameters using\nNTP, MTP, and TOP objectives. Results on eight standard NLP benchmarks show\nthat TOP overall outperforms both NTP and MTP even at scale.
