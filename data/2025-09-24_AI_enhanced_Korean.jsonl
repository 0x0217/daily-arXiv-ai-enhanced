By integrating reasoning with perception, memory, and\ntool use, agents are increasingly deployed in diverse domains like web\nnavigation and household robotics. A critical challenge, however, lies in\nensuring agent generalizability - the ability to maintain consistent\nperformance across varied instructions, tasks, environments, and domains,\nespecially those beyond agents' fine-tuning data. Despite growing interest, the\nconcept of generalizability in LLM-based agents remains underdefined, and\nsystematic approaches to measure and improve it are lacking. In this survey, we\nprovide the first comprehensive review of generalizability in LLM-based agents.\nWe begin by emphasizing agent generalizability's importance by appealing to\nstakeholders and clarifying the boundaries of agent generalizability by\nsituating it within a hierarchical domain-task ontology. We then review\ndatasets, evaluation dimensions, and metrics, highlighting their limitations.\nNext, we categorize methods for improving generalizability into three groups:\nmethods for the backbone LLM, for agent components, and for their interactions.\nMoreover, we introduce the distinction between generalizable frameworks and\ngeneralizable agents and outline how generalizable frameworks can be translated\ninto agent-level generalizability. Finally, we identify critical challenges and\nfuture directions, including developing standardized frameworks, variance- and\ncost-based metrics, and approaches that integrate methodological innovations\nwith architecture-level designs. By synthesizing progress and highlighting\nopportunities, this survey aims to establish a foundation for principled\nresearch on building LLM-based agents that generalize reliably across diverse\napplications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc885\ud569\uc801\uc778

A\ngrowing body of work has explored ways to improve their reasoning, from\nself-consistency and chain-of-thought to multi-agent debate. Inspired by the\ndynamics of scientific committees and the \"Society of Mind,\" we introduce\nRoundtable Policy, a complementary inference-time reasoning framework that\nperforms inference through the weighted consensus of multiple LLMs. Our\nfindings indicate that this approach significantly enhances reasoning in\ncomplex heterogeneous scientific tasks and improves scientific narratives in\nterms of creativity, rigor, and logical coherence, while reducing\nhallucinations that single models are prone to. Our approach emphasizes\nstructured and interpretable consensus rather than opaque convergence, while\nrequiring only black-box access and uniform procedures, making it broadly\napplicable to multi-LLM reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub77c\uc9c0 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc774 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubc0f \uacfc\ud559 \ubc1c\uacac\uc5d0\uc11c \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ub2e4\uc218\uc758 LLM\uc758 \uac00\uc911 \ud569\uc758\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Roundtable Policy\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud588\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub2e4\uc218\uc758 LLM\uc758 \uac00\uc911\ub41c \ud569\uc758\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 Roundtable Policy \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \uacfc\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0, \ucc3d\uc758\uc131, \uc5c4\ubc00\uc131, \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc77c\uad00\uc131 \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \ub0b4\ub7ec\ud2f0\ube0c\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uba70, \ub2e8\uc77c \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ucde8\uc57d\ud55c \ud658\uac01 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \uc904\uc778\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub418\uace0 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud569\uc758\ub97c \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70, \ubd88\ud22c\uba85\ud55c \uc218\ub834 \ub300\uc2e0 \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc0f \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uc808\ucc28\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc740 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \uc0dd\uc131\ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \ubc1c\uacac\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \ub180\ub77c\uc6b4 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc790\uae30 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uacfc \uc0ac\uace0\uc758 \uc0ac\uc2ac, \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud1a0\ub860 \ub4f1 \uadf8\ub4e4\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub9ce\uc740 \uc5f0\uad6c\uac00 \uc9c4\ud589\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uacfc\ud559 \uc704\uc6d0\ud68c\uc758 \uc5ed\ub3d9\uc131\uacfc '\ub9c8\uc74c\uc758 \uc0ac\ud68c'\uc5d0\uc11c \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc544 Roundtable Policy\ub77c\ub294 \ubcf4\uc644\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc\uac04 \ucd94\ub860 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ub2e4\uc218\uc758 LLM\uc758 \uac00\uc911 \ud569\uc758\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc774 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc774\uc9c8\uc801 \uacfc\ud559 \uacfc\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0, \ucc3d\uc758\uc131, \uc5c4\ubc00\uc131, \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc77c\uad00\uc131 \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \ub0b4\ub7ec\ud2f0\ube0c\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uba70, \ub2e8\uc77c \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ucde8\uc57d\ud55c \ud658\uac01 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \uc904\uc778\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ubd88\ud22c\uba85\ud55c \uc218\ub834 \ub300\uc2e0 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub418\uace0 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud569\uc758\ub97c \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70, \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc0f \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uc808\ucc28\ub9cc\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\ubbc0\ub85c \ub2e4\uc218 LLM \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud558\uac8c \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\ub2e4."}}

Existing methods often assume static\nneighborhoods, limiting adaptability to dynamic or heterogeneous environments.\nWhile centralized frameworks can learn dynamic graphs, their reliance on global\nstate access and centralized infrastructure is impractical in real-world\ndecentralized systems. We propose a stochastic graph-based policy for\nNetworked-MARL, where each agent conditions its decision on a sampled subgraph\nover its local physical neighborhood. Building on this formulation, we\nintroduce BayesG, a decentralized actor-framework that learns sparse,\ncontext-aware interaction structures via Bayesian variational inference.

Static analysis tools like Bandit\nare effective at vulnerability detection but suffer from high false positives\nand lack repair capabilities. Large Language Models (LLMs), in contrast, can\nsuggest fixes but often hallucinate changes and lack self-validation. We\npresent SecureFixAgent, a hybrid repair framework integrating Bandit with\nlightweight local LLMs (<8B parameters) in an iterative detect-repair-validate\nloop. To improve precision, we apply parameter-efficient LoRA-based fine-tuning\non a diverse, curated dataset spanning multiple Python project domains,\nmitigating dataset bias and reducing unnecessary edits. SecureFixAgent uses\nBandit for detection, the LLM for candidate fixes with explanations, and Bandit\nre-validation for verification, all executed locally to preserve privacy and\nreduce cloud reliance. Experiments show SecureFixAgent reduces false positives\nby 10.8% over static analysis, improves fix accuracy by 13.51%, and lowers\nfalse positives by 5.46% compared to pre-trained LLMs, typically converging\nwithin three iterations. Beyond metrics, developer studies rate explanation\nquality 4.5/5, highlighting its value for human trust and adoption.

Our evaluations\non state-of-the-art LLMs reveal a universal failure pattern: accuracy collapses\nexponentially beyond a model-specific logical depth. Unlike existing\nbenchmarks, seqBench's fine-grained control facilitates targeted analyses of\nthese reasoning failures, illuminating universal scaling laws and statistical\nlimits, as detailed in this paper alongside its generation methodology and\nevaluation metrics. We find that even top-performing models systematically fail\non seqBench's structured reasoning tasks despite minimal search complexity,\nunderscoring key limitations in their commonsense reasoning capabilities.\nDesigned for future evolution to keep pace with advancing models, the seqBench\ndatasets are publicly released to spur deeper scientific inquiry into LLM\nreasoning, aiming to establish a clearer understanding of their true potential\nand current boundaries for robust real-world application.", "AI": {"tldr": "seqBench\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758

We propose a\nblockchain-based framework that enables transparent agent registration,\nverifiable task allocation, and dynamic reputation tracking through smart\ncontracts. The core of our design lies in two mechanisms: a matching\nscore-based task allocation protocol that evaluates agents by reputation,\ncapability match, and workload; and a behavior-shaping incentive mechanism that\nadjusts agent behavior via feedback on performance and reward. Our\nimplementation integrates GPT-4 agents with Solidity contracts and\ndemonstrates, through 50-round simulations, strong task success rates, stable\nutility distribution, and emergent agent specialization.

Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, due\nto its unique architectural designs in consensus mechanisms, resource\nmanagement, and throughput, TRON has developed a more distinctive ecosystem and\napplication scenarios centered around stablecoins. Although it is popular in\nareas like stablecoin payments and settlement, research on analyzing on-chain\ndata from the TRON blockchain is remarkably scarce. To fill this gap, this\npaper proposes a comprehensive data extraction and exploration framework for\nthe TRON blockchain. An innovative high-performance ETL system aims to\nefficiently extract raw on-chain data from TRON, including blocks,\ntransactions, smart contracts, and receipts, establishing a research dataset.\nAn in-depth analysis of the extracted dataset reveals insights into TRON's\nblock generation, transaction trends, the dominance of exchanges, the resource\ndelegation market, smart contract usage patterns, and the central role of the\nUSDT stablecoin.

Such capabilities, however, are critical for applications like\ncontent-aware graphic layout design, which demands precise placement,\nalignment, and structural organization of multiple elements within constrained\nvisual spaces. To address this gap, we propose LaySPA, a reinforcement\nlearning-based framework that augments LLM agents with explicit spatial\nreasoning capabilities. LaySPA leverages hybrid reward signals that capture\ngeometric validity, structural fidelity, and visual quality, enabling agents to\nmodel inter-element relationships, navigate the canvas, and optimize spatial\narrangements. Through iterative self-exploration and adaptive policy\noptimization, LaySPA produces both interpretable reasoning traces and\nstructured layouts.

However, inherent historical biases in tabular datasets often cause\nLLMs to exacerbate fairness issues, particularly when multiple advantaged and\nprotected features are involved. In this work, we introduce a universal\ndebiasing framework that minimizes group-level dependencies by simultaneously\nreducing the mutual information between advantaged and protected attributes. By\nleveraging the autoregressive structure and analytic sampling distributions of\nLLM-based tabular data generators, our approach efficiently computes mutual\ninformation, reducing the need for cumbersome numerical estimations. Building\non this foundation, we propose two complementary methods: a direct preference\noptimization (DPO)-based strategy, namely UDF-DPO, that integrates seamlessly\nwith existing models, and a targeted debiasing technique, namely UDF-MIX, that\nachieves debiasing without tuning the parameters of LLMs. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our framework effectively balances fairness and utility,\noffering a scalable and practical solution for debiasing in high-stakes\napplications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud14c\uc774\ube14 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ubcf4\ud3b8\uc801\uc778 \ub514\ubc14\uc774\uc2f1 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uacfc \uc720\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \uade0\ud615 \uc788\uac8c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uad6c\ud604\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM\uc774 \ud14c\uc774\ube14 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc0dd\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc600\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uacf5\uc815\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \uc2ec\ud654\ub418\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc0c1\ud638 \uc815\ubcf4\ub7c9\uc744 \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba70 \uadf8\ub8f9 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ubcf4\ud3b8\uc801\uc778 \ub514\ubc14\uc774\uc2f1 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0, UDF-DPO \ubc0f UDF-MIX \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uacfc \uc720\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uade0\ud615 \uc788\uac8c \uc720\uc9c0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uace0\uc704\ud5d8 \uc751\uc6a9 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ub514\ubc14\uc774\uc2f1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc740 \ud14c\uc774\ube14 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc0dd\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ud14c\uc774\ube14 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc758 \ub0b4\uc7ac\ub41c \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc740 LLM\uc774 \uacf5\uc815\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc545\ud654\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ud2b9\ud788 \ub2e4\uc218\uc758 \uc720\ub9ac\ud55c \ubc0f \ubcf4\ud638\ub41c \ud2b9\uc131\uc774 \uc5f0\uad00\ub420 \uacbd\uc6b0 \ub354\uc6b1 \uadf8\ub807\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc720\ub9ac\ud55c \uc18d\uc131\uacfc \ubcf4\ud638\ub41c \uc18d\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ucf1c \uadf8\ub8f9 \uc218\uc900 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ubcf4\ud3b8\uc801\uc778 \ub514\ubc14\uc774\uc2f1 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, Rust permits the use\nof unsafe code, which bypasses compiler-enforced safety checks and can\nintroduce memory vulnerabilities. A widely adopted approach for detecting\nmemory safety bugs in Rust is Address Sanitizer (ASan). Optimized versions,\nsuch as ERASan and RustSan, have been proposed to selectively apply security\nchecks in order to reduce performance overhead. However, these tools still\nincur significant performance and memory overhead and fail to detect many\nclasses of memory safety vulnerabilities due to the inherent limitations of\nASan. In this paper, we present LiteRSan, a novel memory safety sanitizer that\naddresses the limitations of prior approaches. By leveraging Rust's unique\nownership model, LiteRSan performs Rust-specific static analysis that is aware\nof pointer lifetimes to identify risky pointers. It then selectively\ninstruments risky pointers to enforce only the necessary spatial or temporal\nmemory safety checks.

Existing methods often rely on static modality fusion\nstrategies and neglect the spatial cues embedded in stereo audio, leading to\nperformance degradation in cluttered or occluded scenes. To address these\nissues, we propose an end-to-end reinforcement learning-based AVN framework\nwith two key innovations: (1) a \\textbf{S}tereo-Aware \\textbf{A}ttention\n\\textbf{M}odule (\\textbf{SAM}), which learns and exploits the spatial disparity\nbetween left and right audio channels to enhance directional sound perception;\nand (2) an \\textbf{A}udio-\\textbf{G}uided \\textbf{D}ynamic \\textbf{F}usion\nModule (\\textbf{AGDF}), which dynamically adjusts the fusion ratio between\nvisual and auditory features based on audio cues, thereby improving robustness\nto environmental changes. Extensive experiments are conducted on two realistic\n3D scene datasets, Replica and Matterport3D, demonstrating that our method\nsignificantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of navigation success\nrate and path efficiency. Notably, our model achieves over 40\\% improvement\nunder audio-only conditions compared to the best-performing baselines.

Leveraging machine learning-based matching\ntechniques to control for demographic composition, we estimate the effects of\nseveral types of urban structures on the incidence of violent crime in New York\nCity and Chicago. We additionally contribute to a growing body of literature\ndocumenting the relationship between perception of crime and actual crime rates\nby separately analyzing how the physical urban landscape shapes subjective\nfeelings of safety. Our results are twofold. First, in consensus with prior\nwork, we demonstrate a \"broken windows\" effect in which abandoned buildings, a\nsign of social disorder, are associated with both greater incidence of crime\nand a heightened perception of danger. This is also true of types of urban\nstructures that draw foot traffic such as public transportation infrastructure.\nSecond, these effects are not uniform within or across cities. The criminogenic\neffects of the same structure types across two cities differ in magnitude,\ndegree of spatial localization, and heterogeneity across subgroups, while\nwithin the same city, the effects of different structure types are confounded\nby different demographic variables.

Reinforcement\nlearning offers a way to model sequential decision-making through dynamic\nprogramming to anticipate future environmental changes. However, applying\nmulti-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to decentralized combinatorial\noptimization problems remains an open challenge due to the exponential growth\nof the joint state-action space, high communication overhead, and privacy\nconcerns in centralized training. To address these limitations, this paper\nproposes Hierarchical Reinforcement and Collective Learning (HRCL), a novel\napproach that leverages both MARL and decentralized collective learning based\non a hierarchical framework. Agents take high-level strategies using MARL to\ngroup possible plans for action space reduction and constrain the agent\nbehavior for Pareto optimality. Meanwhile, the low-level collective learning\nlayer ensures efficient and decentralized coordinated decisions among agents\nwith minimal communication. Extensive experiments in a synthetic scenario and\nreal-world smart city application models, including energy self-management and\ndrone swarm sensing, demonstrate that HRCL significantly improves performance,\nscalability, and adaptability compared to the standalone MARL and collective\nlearning approaches, achieving a win-win synthesis solution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774

Encryption serves as one of the\nprivacy-preserving methods; however, its realization in the audio domain\npredominantly relies on signal processing or software methods embedded into\nhardware. In this paper, we introduce LenslessMic, a hybrid optical\nhardware-based encryption method that utilizes a lensless camera as a physical\nlayer of security applicable to multiple types of audio. We show that\nLenslessMic enables (1) robust authentication of audio recordings and (2)\nencryption strength that can rival the search space of 256-bit digital\nstandards, while maintaining high-quality signals and minimal loss of content\ninformation.

Recent extensions of RAG to graph-based retrieval offer a\npromising direction, leveraging the structural knowledge for multi-hop\nreasoning. However, existing graph RAG typically decouples retrieval and\nreasoning processes, which prevents the retriever from adapting to the\nreasoning needs of the LLM. They also struggle with scalability when performing\nmulti-hop expansion over large-scale graphs, or depend heavily on annotated\nground-truth entities, which are often unavailable in open-domain settings. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a novel graph retriever trained end-to-end\nwith LLM, which features an attention-based growing and pruning mechanism,\nadaptively navigating multi-hop relevant entities while filtering out noise.\nWithin the extracted subgraph, structural knowledge and semantic features are\nencoded via soft tokens and the verbalized graph, respectively, which are\ninfused into the LLM together, thereby enhancing its reasoning capability and\nfacilitating interactive joint training of the graph retriever and the LLM\nreasoner. Experimental results across three QA benchmarks show that our\napproach consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the\nstrength of joint graph-LLM optimization for complex reasoning tasks.

We present an LLM-based SLR evaluation copilot built on a\nMulti-Agent System (MAS) architecture to assist researchers in assessing the\noverall quality of the systematic literature reviews. The system automates\nprotocol validation, methodological assessment, and topic relevance checks\nusing a scholarly database. Unlike conventional single-agent methods, our\ndesign integrates a specialized agentic approach aligned with PRISMA guidelines\nto support more structured and interpretable evaluations. We conducted an\ninitial study on five published SLRs from diverse domains, comparing system\noutputs to expert-annotated PRISMA scores, and observed 84% agreement. While\nearly results are promising, this work represents a first step toward scalable\nand accurate NLP-driven systems for interdisciplinary workflows and reveals\ntheir capacity for rigorous, domain-agnostic knowledge aggregation to\nstreamline the review process.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ubb38\ud5cc \uac80\ud1a0(SLR)\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c LLM \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ucf54\ud30c\uc77c\ub7ff\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "SLR\uc740 \uc99d\uac70 \uae30\ubc18 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc2dc\uac04\uacfc \ub178\ub825\uc744 \ub9ce\uc774 \uc18c\ubaa8\ud558\uace0 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "Multi-Agent System (MAS) \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 LLM\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c \uac80\uc99d, \ubc29\ubc95\ub860 \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc0f \uc8fc\uc81c \uad00\ub828\uc131 \uac80\uc0ac\ub97c \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "5\uac1c\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubd84\uc57c\uc758 SLR\uc744 \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ucd08\uae30 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ucd9c\ub825\uacfc \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc8fc\uc11d\uc758 PRISMA \uc810\uc218 \uac04\uc5d0 84% \uc77c\uce58\ub97c \uad00\ucc30\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ucd08\uae30 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc720\ub9dd\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud559\uc81c\uac04 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud750\ub984\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uc815\ud655\ud55c NLP \uae30\ubc18 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ud5a5\ud55c \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub85c, \uac80\ud1a0 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uac04\uc18c\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc9d1\ud569\uc758 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \uad6c\ucd95 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uccb4\uacc4\uc801 \ubb38\ud5cc \uac80\ud1a0(SLR)\ub294 \uc99d\uac70 \uae30\ubc18 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub178\ub3d9\uc9d1\uc57d\uc801\uc774\uba70 \ud559\ubb38 \ubd84\uc57c \uac04 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc790\ub4e4\uc774 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801 \ubb38\ud5cc \uac80\ud1a0\uc758 \uc804\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc744 \uc8fc\uae30 \uc704\ud574 Multi-Agent System (MAS) \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c LLM \uae30\ubc18 SLR \ud3c9\uac00 \ub3c4\uc6c0\ub9d0\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ud559\uc220 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ubca0\uc774\uc2a4\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c \uac80\uc99d, \ubc29\ubc95\ub860 \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc0f \uc8fc\uc81c \uad00\ub828\uc131 \uac80\uc0ac \ub4f1\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubc29\uc2dd\uacfc\ub294 \ub2ec\ub9ac, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc124\uacc4\ub294 PRISMA \uac00\uc774\ub4dc\ub77c\uc778\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucd98 \uc804\ubb38\ud654\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uad6c\uc870\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubd84\uc57c\uc758 5\uac1c \ubc1c\ud45c\ub41c SLR\uc744 \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ucd08\uae30 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc600\uace0, \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ucd9c\ub825\uacfc \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc8fc\uc11d\uc758 PRISMA \uc810\uc218 \uac04\uc758 84% \uc77c\uce58\ub97c \uad00\ucc30\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd08\uae30 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc720\ub9dd\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud559\uc81c \uac04 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud750\ub984\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uc815\ud655\ud55c NLP \uae30\ubc18 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\uc544\uac00\ub294 \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc774\uba70, \uac80\ud1a0 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uac04\uc18c\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc5c4\uaca9\ud558\uace0 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0 \uad6c\uc560\ubc1b\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc9d1\ud569\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, existing works mainly focus on pixel-level triggers that\nare impractical to deploy in the real world. We address this gap by introducing\na novel backdoor attack against the end-to-end AD systems that leverage one or\nmore other vehicles' trajectories as triggers. To generate precise trigger\ntrajectories, we first use temporal logic (TL) specifications to define the\nbehaviors of attacker vehicles. Configurable behavior models are then used to\ngenerate these trajectories, which are quantitatively evaluated and iteratively\nrefined based on the TL specifications.

Existing\ntrajectory anomaly detection methods fail to simultaneously consider both the\nhigh-level intentions of agents as well as the low-level details of the agent's\nnavigation when analysing an agent's trajectories. This limits their ability to\ncapture the full diversity of normal trajectories. In this paper, we propose an\nunsupervised trajectory anomaly detection method named Intention-aware\nHierarchical Diffusion model (IHiD), which detects anomalies through both\nhigh-level intent evaluation and low-level sub-trajectory analysis. Our\napproach leverages Inverse Q Learning as the high-level model to assess whether\na selected subgoal aligns with an agent's intention based on predicted\nQ-values. Meanwhile, a diffusion model serves as the low-level model to\ngenerate sub-trajectories conditioned on subgoal information, with anomaly\ndetection based on reconstruction error. By integrating both models, IHiD\neffectively utilises subgoal transition knowledge and is designed to capture\nthe diverse distribution of normal trajectories.

This paper introduces ViTCAE, a framework\nthat addresses these issues by re-purposing the Class token into a generative\nlinchpin. In our architecture, the encoder maps the Class token to a global\nlatent variable that dictates the prior distribution for local, patch-level\nlatent variables, establishing a robust dependency where global semantics\ndirectly inform the synthesis of local details. Drawing inspiration from\nopinion dynamics, we treat each attention head as a dynamical system of\ninteracting tokens seeking consensus. This perspective motivates a\nconvergence-aware temperature scheduler that adaptively anneals each head's\ninfluence function based on its distributional stability. This process enables\na principled head-freezing mechanism, guided by theoretically-grounded\ndiagnostics like an attention evolution distance and a consensus/cluster\nfunctional. This technique prunes converged heads during training to\nsignificantly improve computational efficiency without sacrificing fidelity. By\nunifying a generative Class token with an adaptive attention mechanism rooted\nin multi-agent consensus theory, ViTCAE offers a more efficient and\ncontrollable approach to transformer-based

Although agents seek distinct\nobjectives, collaboration among them can be beneficial in scenarios where\nrelationships between tasks exist. Among the various approaches to promoting\nrelationships between tasks and, consequently, enhancing collaboration between\nagents, one notable method is regularization. While previous multitask learning\nstudies have focused on smooth regularization to enforce graph smoothness, this\nwork explores non-smooth regularization techniques that promote sparsity,\nmaking them particularly effective in encouraging piecewise constant\ntransitions on the graph. We begin by formulating a global regularized\noptimization problem, which involves minimizing the aggregate sum of individual\ncosts, regularized by a general non-smooth term designed to promote\npiecewise-constant relationships between the tasks of neighboring agents. Based\non the forward-backward splitting strategy, we propose a decentralized learning\napproach that enables efficient solutions to the regularized optimization\nproblem. Then, under convexity assumptions on the cost functions and\nco-regularization, we establish that the proposed approach converges in the\nmean-square-error sense within $O(\\mu)$ of the optimal solution of the globally\nregularized cost. For broader applicability and improved computational\nefficiency, we also derive closed-form expressions for commonly used non-smooth\n(and, possibly, non-convex) regularizers, such as the weighted sum of the\n$\\ell_0$-norm, $\\ell_1$-norm, and elastic net regularization. Finally, we\nillustrate both the theoretical findings and the effectiveness of the approach\nthrough simulations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc791\uc5c5 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc5d0\uc11c

While input manipulation\nattacks (e.g., prompt injection) have been well studied, Bit-Flip Attacks\n(BFAs) -- which exploit hardware vulnerabilities to corrupt model parameters\nand cause severe performance degradation -- have received far less attention.\nExisting BFA methods suffer from key limitations: they fail to balance\nperformance degradation and output naturalness, making them prone to discovery.\nIn this paper, we introduce SilentStriker, the first stealthy bit-flip attack\nagainst LLMs that effectively degrades task performance while maintaining\noutput naturalness. Our core contribution lies in addressing the challenge of\ndesigning effective loss functions for LLMs with variable output length and the\nvast output space. Unlike prior approaches that rely on output perplexity for\nattack loss formulation, which inevitably degrade output naturalness, we\nreformulate the attack objective by leveraging key output tokens as targets for\nsuppression, enabling effective joint optimization of attack effectiveness and\nstealthiness.

When dealing with distributed, high-dimensional problems in\nstate and control variables, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has been\nproposed as a scalable approach for breaking the curse of dimensionality. In\nparticular, through decentralized training and execution, multiple agents\ncooperate to steer the system towards a target configuration, relying solely on\nlocal state and reward information. However, the principle of locality may\nbecome a limiting factor whenever a collective, nonlocal behavior of the agents\nis crucial to maximize the reward function, as typically happens in\nPDE-constrained optimal control problems. In this work, we propose HypeMARL: a\ndecentralized MARL algorithm tailored to the control of high-dimensional,\nparametric, and distributed systems. HypeMARL employs hypernetworks to\neffectively parametrize the agents' policies and value functions with respect\nto the system parameters and the agents' relative positions, encoded by\nsinusoidal positional encoding. Through the application on challenging control\nproblems, such as density and flow control, we show that HypeMARL (i) can\neffectively control systems through a collective behavior of the agents,\noutperforming state-of-the-art decentralized MARL, (ii) can efficiently deal\nwith parametric dependencies, (iii) requires minimal hyperparameter tuning and\n(iv) can reduce the amount of expensive environment interactions by a factor of\n~10 thanks to its model-based extension, MB-HypeMARL, which relies on\ncomputationally efficient deep learning-based surrogate models approximating\nthe dynamics locally, with minimal deterioration of the policy performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub525 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \ucd5c\uadfc \ubd80\ubd84 \ubbf8\ubd84 \ubc29\uc815\uc2dd(PDE)\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c0\ubc30\ub418\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub3d9\uc801 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc804\ub7b5\uc73c\ub85c \ubd80\uc0c1\ud588\ub2e4. \ub2e4\ucc28\uc6d0 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(MARL)\uc774 \uc81c\uc548\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\ub098, \ube44\uad6d\uc18c\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uacbd\uc6b0 \ud55c\uacc4\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 HypeMARL\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ubd84\uc0b0 MARL \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0, \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ud654\ub41c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc81c\uc5b4\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucdb0\uc838 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc81c\uc5b4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\ucc28\uc6d0 \uc0c1\ud0dc \ubc0f \uc81c\uc5b4 \ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub3d9\uc801 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc81c\uc5b4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860 \ud544\uc694.", "method": "HypeMARL\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ubd84\uc0b0 MARL \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc815\ucc45\uacfc \uac00\uce58 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "HypeMARL\uc740 \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ubd84\uc0b0 MARL\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc81c\uc5b4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc5d0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub300\ucc98\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "HypeMARL\uc740 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud55c\uc758 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \uc870\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \ud658\uacbd \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ub300\ud3ed \uc904\uc774\ub294 \ub4f1 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub525 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \ucd5c\uadfc \ubd80\ubd84 \ubbf8\ubd84 \ubc29\uc815\uc2dd(PDE)\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c0\ubc30\ub418\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub3d9\uc801 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc804\ub7b5\uc73c\ub85c \ub5a0\uc62c\ub790\ub2e4. \ubd84\uc0b0\ub418\uace0 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0\uc801\uc778 \uc0c1\ud0dc \ubc0f \uc81c\uc5b4 \ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8f0 \ub54c, \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(MARL)\uc740 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc758 \uc800\uc8fc\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uc548\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788, \ubd84\uc0b0\ub41c \ud6c8\ub828\uacfc \uc2e4\ud589\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc9c0\uc5ed \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc640 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc815\ubcf4\uc5d0\ub9cc \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa9\ud45c \uad6c\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud611\ub825\ud55c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc9d1\ud569\uc801 \ube44\uad6d\uc18c\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9\uc774 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uacbd\uc6b0, \uc989 PDE \uc81c\ud55c \ucd5c\uc801 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub098\ud0c0\ub098\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uc5d0\ub294 \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc131 \uc6d0\uce59\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c \uc694\uc18c\uac00 \ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0, \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ud654\ub41c \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc81c\uc5b4\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucd98 \ubd84\uc0b0 MARL \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc778 HypeMARL\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

ARE provides simple\nabstractions to build complex and diverse environments, each with their own\nrules, tools, content, and verifiers, helping to bridge the gap between model\ndevelopment and real-world deployment. We also propose Gaia2, a benchmark built\nin ARE and designed to measure general agent capabilities. Beyond search and\nexecution, Gaia2 requires agents to handle ambiguities and noise, adapt to\ndynamic environments, collaborate with other agents, and operate under temporal\nconstraints. Unlike prior benchmarks, Gaia2 runs asynchronously, surfacing new\nfailure modes that are invisible in static settings. Our experiments show that\nno system dominates across the intelligence spectrum: stronger reasoning often\ncomes at the cost of efficiency, and budget scaling curves plateau,\nhighlighting the need for new architectures and adaptive compute strategies.\nPerhaps more importantly, ARE abstractions enable continuous extension of Gaia2\nto other environments, empowering the community to rapidly create new\nbenchmarks tailored to their domains.

However, clinical imaging is either incompatible with\nLVADs or yields sparse, low-quality velocity data.

To address this, we propose\nLVADNet3D, a 3D convolutional autoencoder that reconstructs full-resolution\nintraventricular velocity fields from sparse velocity vector inputs. In\ncontrast to a standard UNet3D model, LVADNet3D incorporates hybrid downsampling\nand a deeper encoder-decoder architecture with increased channel capacity to\nbetter capture spatial flow patterns. To train and evaluate the models, we\ngenerate a high-resolution synthetic dataset of intraventricular blood flow in\nLVAD-supported hearts using CFD simulations.

Check out our repository:\n  https://github.com/nbshenxm/pentest-agent", "summary": "Security practitioners face growing challenges in exploit assessment, as\npublic vulnerability repositories are increasingly populated with inconsistent\nand low-quality exploit artifacts. Existing scoring systems, such as CVSS and\nEPSS, offer limited support for this task. They either rely on theoretical\nmetrics or produce opaque probability estimates without assessing whether\nusable exploit code exists. In practice, security teams often resort to manual\ntriage of exploit repositories, which is time-consuming, error-prone, and\ndifficult to scale. We present AEAS, an automated system designed to assess and\nprioritize actionable exploits through static analysis. AEAS analyzes both\nexploit code and associated documentation to extract a structured set of\nfeatures reflecting exploit availability, functionality, and setup complexity.\nIt then computes an actionability score for each exploit and produces ranked\nexploit recommendations. We evaluate AEAS on a dataset of over 5,000\nvulnerabilities derived from 600+ real-world applications frequently\nencountered by red teams. Manual validation and expert review on representative\nsubsets show that AEAS achieves a 100% top-3 success rate in recommending\nfunctional exploits and shows strong alignment with expert-validated rankings.\nThese results demonstrate the effectiveness of AEAS in supporting\nexploit-driven vulnerability prioritization.", "AI": {"tldr": "AEAS\ub294 \uc815\uc801 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud65c\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc775\uc2a4\ud50c\ub85c\uc787\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc6b0\uc120\uc21c\uc704\ub97c \ub9e4\uae30\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubcf4\uc548 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\ub4e4\uc740 \uacf5\uacf5 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810 \uc800\uc7a5\uc18c\uc5d0 \uc788\ub294 \ube44\uc77c\uad00\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc800\ud488\uc9c8\uc758 \uc775\uc2a4\ud50c\ub85c\uc787 \uc544\ud2f0\ud329\ud2b8\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc775\uc2a4\ud50c\ub85c\uc787 \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0\uc11c \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc740 \ub3c4\uc804\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "AEAS\ub294 \uc775\uc2a4\ud50c\ub85c\uc787 \ucf54\ub4dc\uc640 \uad00\ub828 \ubb38\uc11c\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc5ec \uc775\uc2a4\ud50c\ub85c\uc787\uc758 \uac00\uc6a9\uc131, \uae30\ub2a5\uc131, \uc124\uc815 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \ubc18\uc601\ud558\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uae30\ub2a5 \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \ucd94\ucd9c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "AEAS\ub294 600\uac1c \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0\uc11c \ud30c\uc0dd\ub41c 5,000\uac1c \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud3c9\uac00\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uc218\ub3d9 \uac80\uc99d\uacfc \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uac80\ud1a0\uc5d0\uc11c 100%\uc758 \uc0c1\uc704 3 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 AEAS\uac00 \uc775\uc2a4\ud50c\ub85c\uc787 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810 \uc6b0\uc120\uc21c\uc704 \ub9e4\uae30\uae30\uc5d0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubcf4\uc548 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\ub4e4\uc740 \uacf5\uacf5 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810 \uc800\uc7a5\uc18c\uc5d0 \uc788\ub294 \ube44\uc77c\uad00\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc800\ud488\uc9c8\uc758 \uc775\uc2a4\ud50c\ub85c\uc787 \uc544\ud2f0\ud329\ud2b8\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc775\uc2a4\ud50c\ub85c\uc787 \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0\uc11c \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc740 \ub3c4\uc804\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc810\uc218 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c, \uc608\ub97c \ub4e4\uc5b4 CVSS\uc640 EPSS\ub294 \uc774 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc9c0\uc6d0\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\ub4e4\uc740 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc775\uc2a4\ud50c\ub85c\uc787 \ucf54\ub4dc\uc758 \uc874\uc7ac \uc5ec\ubd80\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \ubd88\ud22c\uba85\ud55c \ud655\ub960 \ucd94\uc815\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc2e4\uc81c\ub85c \ubcf4\uc548 \ud300\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uc2dc\uac04\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \uac78\ub9ac\uace0 \uc624\ub958\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uae30 \uc26c\uc6b0\uba70 \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \uc775\uc2a4\ud50c\ub85c\uc787 \uc800\uc7a5\uc18c\uc758 \uc218\ub3d9 \uc2ec\uc0ac\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc815\uc801 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc775\uc2a4\ud50c\ub85c\uc787\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc6b0\uc120 \uc21c\uc704\ub97c \ub9e4\uae30\ub3c4\ub85d \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc790\ub3d9\ud654 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c AEAS\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.

While\ntabular settings benefit from well-understood hardness measures like MDP\ndiameter and suboptimality gaps, deep RL benchmarks are often chosen based on\nintuition and popularity. This raises a critical question: can tabular hardness\nmetrics be adapted to guide non-tabular benchmarking? We investigate this\nquestion and reveal a fundamental gap. Our primary contribution is\ndemonstrating that the difficulty of non-tabular environments is dominated by a\nfactor that tabular metrics ignore: representation hardness. The same\nunderlying MDP can pose vastly different challenges depending on whether the\nagent receives state vectors or pixel-based observations. To enable this\nanalysis, we introduce \\texttt{pharos}, a new open-source library for\nprincipled RL benchmarking that allows for systematic control over both\nenvironment structure and agent representations. Our extensive case study using\n\\texttt{pharos} shows that while tabular metrics offer some insight, they are\npoor predictors of deep RL agent performance on their own.

To address this challenge, Federated\nLearning (FL) has recently emerged as a novel paradigm that enables\ncollaborative training of ML models across multiple clients while ensuring that\nsensitive data remains local. Nevertheless, Federated Averaging (FedAvg), the\ncanonical FL algorithm, has proven poor convergence in heterogeneous\nenvironments where data distributions are non-independent and identically\ndistributed (i.i.d.) and client datasets are unbalanced, conditions frequently\nobserved in cybersecurity contexts. To overcome these challenges, several\nalternative FL strategies have been developed, yet their applicability to\nnetwork intrusion detection remains insufficiently explored. This study\nsystematically reviews and evaluates a range of FL methods in the context of\nintrusion detection for DDoS attacks. Using a dataset of network attacks within\na Kubernetes-based testbed, we assess convergence efficiency, computational\noverhead, bandwidth consumption, and model accuracy.

Prior research suggests that security\nflaws at the model level do not fully capture the risks present in agentic\ndeployments, where models interact with tools and external environments. This\npaper investigates this gap by conducting a comparative red teaming analysis of\nGPT-OSS-20B, a 20-billion parameter open-source model. Using our observability\nframework AgentSeer to deconstruct agentic systems into granular actions and\ncomponents, we apply iterative red teaming attacks with harmful objectives from\nHarmBench at two distinct levels: the standalone model and the model operating\nwithin an agentic loop. Our evaluation reveals fundamental differences between\nmodel level and agentic level vulnerability profiles. Critically, we discover\nthe existence of agentic-only vulnerabilities, attack vectors that emerge\nexclusively within agentic execution contexts while remaining inert against\nstandalone models. Agentic level iterative attacks successfully compromise\nobjectives that completely failed at the model level, with tool-calling\ncontexts showing 24\\% higher vulnerability than non-tool contexts. Conversely,\ncertain model-specific exploits work exclusively at the model level and fail\nwhen transferred to agentic contexts, demonstrating that standalone model\nvulnerabilities do not always generalize to deployed systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uace0\uc720\ud55c \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774

In contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs)\noffer strong reasoning capabilities, broad general-purpose knowledge,\nin-context learning, and cross-modal transfer abilities, positioning them as\npowerful tools for automating and generalizing SP workflows. Motivated by these\npotentials, we introduce SignalLLM, the first general-purpose LLM-based agent\nframework for general SP tasks. Unlike prior LLM-based SP approaches that are\nlimited to narrow applications or tricky prompting, SignalLLM introduces a\nprincipled, modular architecture. It decomposes high-level SP goals into\nstructured subtasks via in-context learning and domain-specific retrieval,\nfollowed by hierarchical planning through adaptive retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) and refinement; these subtasks are then executed through\nprompt-based reasoning, cross-modal reasoning, code synthesis, model\ninvocation, or data-driven LLM-assisted modeling. Its generalizable design\nenables the flexible selection of problem solving strategies across different\nsignal modalities, task types, and data conditions.

Oliehoek"], "title": "Conditional Policy Generator for Dynamic Constraint Satisfaction and Optimization", "comment": null, "summary": "Leveraging machine learning methods to solve constraint satisfaction problems\nhas shown promising, but they are mostly limited to a static situation where\nthe problem description is completely known and fixed from the beginning. In\nthis work we present a new approach to constraint satisfaction and optimization\nin dynamically changing environments, particularly when variables in the\nproblem are statistically independent. We frame it as a reinforcement learning\nproblem and introduce a conditional policy generator by borrowing the idea of\nclass conditional generative adversarial networks (GANs). Assuming that the\nproblem includes both static and dynamic constraints, the former are used in a\nreward formulation to guide the policy training such that it learns to map to a\nprobabilistic distribution of solutions satisfying static constraints from a\nnoise prior, which is similar to a generator in GANs.

Successive LRMs\nhave emerged as a promising alternative, leveraging advanced training\ntechniques such as reinforcement learning (RL) and distillation to improve task\naccuracy. However, the impact of these training methods on causality remains\nlargely unexplored. In this study, we conduct a systematic causal analysis on\nLLMs and LRMs, examining structural causal models (SCMs) of four key variables:\nproblem instruction (Z), thinking process (T), reasoning steps (X), and answer\n(Y). Our findings reveal that RLVR-trained LRMs exhibit enhanced causal\nreasoning capabilities, aligning more closely with ideal causal structures,\nwhile LLMs and distilled LRMs fail to address causality-related deficiencies.\nOur further investigation indicates that RLVR reduces spurious correlations and\nstrengthens genuine causal patterns, thereby mitigating unfaithfulness and\nbias. In addition, our inspection on the dynamics of the RLVR training process\nobserves a high correlation between reduced spurious features and improved\ncausal structures, where the causal relationships consistently improve in the\ntraining process. This study contributes to the understanding of causality in\nreasoning models, highlights the critical role of RLVR in enhancing causal\nreasoning, and provides insights for designing future AI systems with stronger\ncausal foundations.

Recent\nadvances in large language models have further improved the ability to extract\nmeaningful representations from clinical texts. However, clinical notes are\noften missing. For example, in our analysis of the MIMIC-IV dataset, 24.5% of\npatients have no available discharge summaries. In such cases, representations\ncan be learned from other modalities such as structured data, chest X-rays, or\nradiology reports. Yet the availability of these modalities is influenced by\nclinical decision-making and varies across patients, resulting in modality\nmissing-not-at-random (MMNAR) patterns. We propose a causal representation\nlearning framework that leverages observed data and informative missingness in\nmultimodal clinical records. It consists of: (1) an MMNAR-aware modality fusion\ncomponent that integrates structured data, imaging, and text while conditioning\non missingness patterns to capture patient health and clinician-driven\nassignment; (2) a modality reconstruction component with contrastive learning\nto ensure semantic sufficiency in representation learning; and (3) a multitask\noutcome prediction model with a rectifier that corrects for residual bias from\nspecific modality observation patterns.

Although embodied agents powered by multimodal large\nlanguage models (MLLMs) offer rich perceptual and interactive capabilities, it\nremains largely unexplored whether they can solve composite tasks. In the\ncurrent work, we designed a set of composite tasks inspired by common daily\nactivities observed in early childhood development. Within a dynamic and\nsimulated home environment, these tasks span three core domains: object\nunderstanding, spatial intelligence, and social activity. We evaluated 17\nleading proprietary and open-source MLLMs on these tasks. The results\nconsistently showed poor performance across all three domains, indicating a\nsubstantial gap between current capabilities and general intelligence\nrequirements. Together, our tasks offer a preliminary framework for evaluating\nthe general capabilities of embodied agents, marking an early but significant\nstep toward the development of embodied MLLMs and their real-world deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "AGI\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \ubcf5\ud569 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 MLLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd80\uc871\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AGI\uc640 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 AI\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \ucc28\ubcc4\uc810\uc740 AGI\uac00 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \ubcf5\ud569 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc77c\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \ud65c\ub3d9\uc5d0\uc11c \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc740 \ubcf5\ud569 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \uac00\uc0c1 \ud648 \ud658\uacbd \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "17\uac1c\uc758 MLLM\ub4e4\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc601\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ub0ae\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc791\uc5c5\uc740 \uad6c\ud604\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ucd08\uae30 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, MLLM\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804 \ubc0f \uc2e4\uc81c \ubc30\uce58\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uccab\uac78\uc74c\uc744 \ub0b4\ub51b\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ub2a5\ub825(AGI)\uacfc \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 AI\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \ucc28\ubcc4\uc810\uc740 AGI\uac00 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \ubcf5\ud569 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(MLLM)\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uad6c\ud604\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \uc778\uc2dd \ubc0f \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uadf8\ub4e4\uc774 \ubcf5\ud569 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub294 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84 \ud0d0\uad6c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc720\uc544 \ubc1c\ub2ec\uc5d0\uc11c \uad00\ucc30\ub418\ub294 \uc77c\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \ud65c\ub3d9\uc5d0 \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc544 \uc77c\ub828\uc758 \ubcf5\ud569 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub3d9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ub41c \uac00\uc815 \ud658\uacbd \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc740 \ubb3c\uccb4 \uc774\ud574, \uacf5\uac04 \uc9c0\ub2a5, \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \ud65c\ub3d9\uc758 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud575\uc2ec \uc601\uc5ed\uc744 \ud3ec\uad04\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 17\uac1c\uc758 \uc120\ub3c4\uc801\uc778 \ub3c5\uc810 \ubc0f \uc624\ud508 \uc18c\uc2a4 MLLM\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc601\uc5ed \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ub0ae\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825\uacfc \uc77c\ubc18 \uc9c0\ub2a5 \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\uc774\uc5d0 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uaca9\ucc28\uac00 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc791\uc5c5\uc740 \uad6c\ud604\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ucd08\uae30 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uad6c\ud604\ub41c MLLM\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uacfc \uc2e4\uc81c \ubc30\uce58\ub85c \ub098\uc544\uac00\ub294 \ucd08\uae30\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub2e8\uacc4\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Annotators & audience members completed surveys on their\nperceived knowledge before & after annotations & lectures respectively.\nFourteen coordinators, each paired with a neuroradiologist, completed the data\nannotation process, averaging 1322.9+/-760.7 hours per dataset per pair and\n1200 segmentations in total. On a scale of 1-10, annotation coordinators\nreported significant increase in familiarity with image segmentation software\npre- and post-annotation, moving from initial average of 6+/-2.9 to final\naverage of 8.9+/-1.1, and significant increase in familiarity with brain tumor\nfeatures pre- and post-annotation, moving from initial average of 6.2+/-2.4 to\nfinal average of 8.1+/-1.2. We demonstrate an innovative offering for providing\nneuroradiology & AI education through an image segmentation challenge to\nenhance understanding of algorithm development, reinforce the concept of data\nreference standard, and diversify opportunities for AI-driven image analysis\namong future physicians.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc2e0\uacbd\uc601\uc0c1 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc5d0 \uc758\ud55c

This fundamental capability marks the dawn of the Age of AI Agency,\ndriven by a critical industry shift: the urgent need for AI systems that don't\njust think, but work. While current AI excels at reasoning and generating\nresponses, industries demand autonomous agents that can execute tasks, operate\ntools, and drive real-world outcomes. As agentic intelligence becomes the\ndefining characteristic separating cognitive systems from productive workers,\nefficiently cultivating machine autonomy becomes paramount. Current approaches\nassume that more data yields better agency, following traditional scaling laws\nfrom language modeling. We fundamentally challenge this paradigm. LIMI (Less Is\nMore for Intelligent Agency) demonstrates that agency follows radically\ndifferent development principles. Through strategic focus on collaborative\nsoftware development and scientific research workflows, we show that\nsophisticated agentic intelligence can emerge from minimal but strategically\ncurated demonstrations of autonomous behavior. Using only 78 carefully designed\ntraining samples, LIMI achieves 73.5% on comprehensive agency benchmarks,\ndramatically outperforming state-of-the-art models: Kimi-K2-Instruct (24.1%),\nDeepSeek-V3.1 (11.9%), Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct (27.5%), and GLM-4.5 (45.1%).\nMost strikingly, LIMI demonstrates 53.7% improvement over models trained on\n10,000 samples-achieving superior agentic intelligence with 128 times fewer\nsamples. Our findings establish the Agency Efficiency Principle: machine\nautonomy emerges not from data abundance but from strategic curation of\nhigh-quality agentic demonstrations.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI

Because code execution reflects many structures\nof real-world workflows, coding problems provide a natural basis for building\nagent training environments.

Existing benchmarks center on\nobjective capabilities and dimensions, but lack an application-scenario\nperspective, limiting external validity. Moreover, current evaluations\ntypically rely on either ELO for overall ranking or MOS for dimension-specific\nscoring, yet both methods have inherent shortcomings and limited\ninterpretability. Therefore, we introduce the Magic Evaluation Framework (MEF),\na systematic and practical approach for evaluating T2I models. First, we\npropose a structured taxonomy encompassing user scenarios, elements, element\ncompositions, and text expression forms to construct the Magic-Bench-377, which\nsupports label-level assessment and ensures a balanced coverage of both user\nscenarios and capabilities. On this basis, we combine ELO and\ndimension-specific MOS to generate model rankings and fine-grained assessments\nrespectively.

Existing approaches\nface several limitations: model-based methods require a large number of\nparameters; data-driven methods rely heavily on labeled datasets; and current\nphysics-informed neural networks (PINNs) often lack aging adaptation, or still\ndepend on many parameters, or continuously regenerate states. In this work, we\npropose SeqBattNet, a discrete-state PINN with built-in aging adaptation for\nbattery modeling, to predict terminal voltage during the discharge process.\nSeqBattNet consists of two components: (i) an encoder, implemented as the\nproposed HRM-GRU deep learning module, which generates cycle-specific aging\nadaptation parameters; and (ii) a decoder, based on the equivalent circuit\nmodel (ECM) combined with deep learning, which uses these parameters together\nwith the input current to predict voltage. The model requires only three basic\nbattery parameters and, when trained on data from a single cell, still achieves\nrobust performance.

In this paper, we\nintroduce Orcust, a framework that integrates Principle-Constrained Reward\nModeling (PCRM) and Online VM-Grounded Trajectory Construction (OVTC) to\nenhance reasoning reliability and data efficiency in interactive GUI tasks. We\nleverages environment-verifiable and LLM-derived principle to enforce\ninterpretable reward signals that constrain long chain-of-thought reasoning and\nrule-based feedback. OVTC spins up instrumented virtual machines to\nautonomously collect structured GUI interaction trajectories with explicit\nprocedural and structural objectives, enabling the training of a stepwise\nreward model that robustly captures human preferences and adheres to\ntask-specific constraints. Extensive experiments on standard GUI benchmarks\ncovering perceptual grounding, foundational operations, and end-to-end task\nexecution reveal that Orcust achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving\nby 22.2\\% on ScreenSpot and 23.9\\% on ScreenSpot-Pro over the base model (i.e.\nQwen2.5-VL-7B).

These models generate observable time series driven\nby evolving, partially-latent microstates. Latent states need to be estimated\nto align simulations with real-world data -- a task traditionally addressed by\nDA, especially in continuous and equation-based models such as those used in\nweather forecasting. However, the nature of ABMs poses challenges for standard\nDA methods. Solving such issues requires adaptation of previous DA techniques,\nor ad-hoc alternatives such as LBI. DA approximates the likelihood in a\nmodel-agnostic way, making it broadly applicable but potentially less precise.\nIn contrast, LBI provides more accurate state estimation by directly leveraging\nthe model's likelihood, but at the cost of requiring a hand-crafted,\nmodel-specific likelihood function, which may be complex or infeasible to\nderive. We compare the two methods on the Bounded-Confidence Model, a\nwell-known opinion dynamics ABM, where agents are affected only by others\nholding sufficiently similar opinions. We find that LBI better recovers latent\nagent-level opinions, even under model mis-specification, leading to improved\nindividual-level forecasts. At the aggregate level, however, both methods\nperform comparably, and DA remains competitive across levels of aggregation\nunder certain parameter settings. Our findings suggest that DA is well-suited\nfor aggregate predictions, while LBI is preferable for agent-level inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ub3d9\ud654(DA)\uc640 \uc6b0\ub3c4 \uae30\ubc18 \ucd94\ub860(LBI)\uc744 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ube44\uad50\ud55c \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378(ABM)\uc5d0\uc11c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ub3d9\ud654(DA)\uc640 \uc6b0\ub3c4 \uae30\ubc18 \ucd94\ub860(LBI)\uc758 \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0 \ube44\uad50\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub450 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc798 \uc54c\ub824\uc9c4 \uc758\uacac \ub3d9\uc801 ABM\uc778 Bounded-Confidence Model\uc5d0\uc11c \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "LBI\ub294 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc758\uacac\uc744 \ub354 \uc798 \ud68c\ubcf5\ud558\uba70 \uac1c\ubcc4 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "DA\ub294 \uc9d1\ud569\uc801\uc778 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0 \uc801\ud569\ud558\uace0, LBI\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc218\uc900 \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0 \ub354 \ubc14\ub78c\uc9c1\ud558\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378(ABM)\uc758 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0\uc11c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ub3d9\ud654(DA)\uc640 \uc6b0\ub3c4 \uae30\ubc18 \ucd94\ub860(LBI)\uc758 \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \ube44\uad50\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc9c4\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ubd80\ubd84 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \ubbf8\uc2dc \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uad6c\ub3d9\ub418\ub294 \uad00\uce21 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \uc77c\uce58\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \ucd94\uc815\ud574\uc57c \ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c DA\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ub2e4\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc84c\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 ABM\uc758 \ud2b9\uc131\uc740 \ud45c\uc900 DA \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub824\uba74 \uc774\uc804 DA \uae30\uc220\uc758 \uc801\uc751 \ub610\ub294 LBI\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc784\uc2dc \ub300\uccb4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

It actively defends its cherished beliefs even in the\nface of contradictory evidence, conveniently interprets information to conform\nto desired narratives, and selectively searches for or avoids information to\nsuit its various purposes. Despite these behaviours deviating from common\nnormative standards for belief updating, we argue that such 'biases' are not\ninherently cognitive flaws, but rather an adaptive response to the significant\npragmatic and cognitive costs associated with revising one's beliefs. This\npaper introduces a formal framework that aims to model the influence of these\ncosts on our belief updating mechanisms.\n  We treat belief updating as a motivated variational decision, where agents\nweigh the perceived 'utility' of a belief against the informational cost\nrequired to adopt a new belief state, quantified by the Kullback-Leibler\ndivergence from the prior to the variational posterior. We perform\ncomputational experiments to demonstrate that simple instantiations of this\nresource-rational model can be used to qualitatively emulate commonplace human\nbehaviours, including confirmation bias and attitude polarisation. In doing so,\nwe suggest that this framework makes steps toward a more holistic account of\nthe motivated Bayesian mechanics of belief change and provides practical\ninsights for predicting, compensating for, and correcting deviations from\ndesired belief updating processes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \ubbff\uc74c \uac31\uc2e0

Using real-world Google Cluster Data (GCD) workload\ntraces and the AGOCS framework, the study extracts node attributes and task\nconstraints, then analyses them to identify suitable node-task pairings. It\nfocuses on tasks that can be executed on either a single node or fewer than a\nthousand out of 12.5k nodes in the analysed GCD cluster. Task constraint\noperators are compacted, pre-processed with one-hot encoding, and used as\nfeatures in a training dataset. Various ML classifiers, including Artificial\nNeural Networks, K-Nearest Neighbours, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, Ridge\nRegression, Adaptive Boosting, and Bagging, are fine-tuned and assessed for\naccuracy and F1-scores.

This\n\"illusion of thinking\" is frequently an artifact of non-agentic, black-box\nevaluation paradigms that fail to cultivate robust problem-solving processes.\nIn response, we introduce The STAR-XAI Protocol (Socratic, Transparent,\nAgentic, Reasoning - for eXplainable Artificial Intelligence), a novel\nmethodology for training and operating verifiably reliable AI agents. Our\nmethod reframes the human-AI interaction as a structured, Socratic dialogue,\ngoverned by an explicit and evolving rulebook, the Consciousness Transfer\nPackage (CTP). Through an interactive Gameplay Cycle that enforces ante-hoc\nstrategic justification and a state-locking Checksum that prevents error\naccumulation, the protocol transforms a powerful but opaque LRM into a\ndisciplined \"Clear Box\" agent. We demonstrate the efficacy of this method\nthrough an exhaustive 25-move case study in the complex strategic game \"Caps i\nCaps\". The agent not only solved the high-complexity puzzle but also\ndemonstrated Second-Order Agency, identifying flaws in its own\nsupervisor-approved plans and adapting its core integrity protocols mid-task.\nThe STAR-XAI Protocol offers a practical pathway to creating AI agents that are\nnot just high-performing, but also transparent, auditable, and trustworthy by\ndesign.", "AI": {"tldr": "STAR-XAI \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc740 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\uace0 \uc6b4\uc601\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc73c\ub85c, \uc778\uac04-AI \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc18c\ud06c\ub77c\ud14c\uc2a4\uc2dd \ub300\ud654\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ub300\ud615 \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uace0\ub09c\uc774\ub3c4 \ubc0f \uc7a5\uae30\uc801 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uacfc \ud22c\uba85\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \ud070 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "STAR-XAI \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc740 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc18c\ud06c\ub77c\ud14c\uc2a4\uc2dd \ub300\ud654\ub85c \uc778\uac04-AI \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc9c4\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uaddc\uce59\uc9d1\uc778 CTP\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uad00\ub9ac\ub41c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \uc815\ub2f9\ud654 \ubc0f \uc624\ub958 \ucd95\uc801 \ubc29\uc9c0\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774 \ud3ec\ud568\ub41c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc804\ub7b5 \uac8c\uc784 'Caps i Caps'\uc5d0\uc11c 25\ub2e8\uacc4\uc758 \uc0ac\ub840 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub192\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ub3c4\uc758 \ud37c\uc990\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0, \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \uacc4\ud68d\uc758 \uacb0 flaws\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uba70 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc911 \ud575\uc2ec \ubb34\uacb0\uc131 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 2\ucc28 \ub300\ub9ac\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "STAR-XAI \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ub192\uc744 \ubfd0 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uc124\uacc4\uc0c1 \ud22c\uba85\ud558\uace0 \uac10\uc0ac \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uba70 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ub300\ud615 \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub378(LRM)\uc740 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uacfc \ud22c\uba85\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, \uace0\ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131 \ubc0f \uc7a5\uae30 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud588\uc744 \ub54c \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \ubb34\ub108\uc9c0\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c '\uc0ac\uace0\uc758 \ud658\uc0c1'\uc740 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ubc30\uc591\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \ube44\ub300\ud654\uc2dd \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 \ud3c9\uac00 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc758 \uc0b0\ubb3c\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub300\uc751\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uc788\ub294 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\uace0 \uc6b4\uc601\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc778 STAR-XAI \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c(\uc18c\ud06c\ub77c\ud14c\uc2a4\uc2dd, \ud22c\uba85, \uc8fc\ub3c4\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 -

This alternative supervision is appealing\nbecause collecting complementary labels is generally cheaper and less\nlabor-intensive. Although most existing research in CLL emphasizes the\ndevelopment of novel loss functions, the potential of data augmentation in this\ndomain remains largely underexplored. In this work, we uncover that the\nwidely-used Mixup data augmentation technique is ineffective when directly\napplied to CLL. Through in-depth analysis, we identify that the\ncomplementary-label noise generated by Mixup negatively impacts the performance\nof CLL models. We then propose an improved technique called Intra-Cluster Mixup\n(ICM), which only synthesizes augmented data from nearby examples, to mitigate\nthe noise effect. ICM carries the benefits of encouraging complementary label\nsharing of nearby examples, and leads to substantial performance improvements\nacross synthetic and real-world labeled datasets. In particular, our wide\nspectrum of experimental results on both balanced and imbalanced CLL settings\njustifies the potential of ICM in allying with state-of-the-art CLL algorithms,\nachieving significant accuracy increases of 30% and 10% on MNIST and CIFAR\ndatasets, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubcf4\uc644 \ub808\uc774\ube14 \ud559\uc2b5(CLL)\uc758 \ub3c4\uc804\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uace0, Mixup \uae30\ubc95\uc774 CLL\uc5d0 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc784\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud55c Intra-Cluster Mixup(ICM) \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b4\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uccb4 \ub808\uc774\ube14 \uc218\uc9d1\uc758 \ube44\uc6a9 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uc0b4\ud3b4\ubcf4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 CLL\uc758 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "Intra-Cluster Mixup (ICM) \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc778\uc811\ud55c \uc608\uc2dc\ub85c\ubd80\ud130\ub9cc \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc99d\uac15\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "ICM\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 MNIST\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 30%, CIFAR\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 10%\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "ICM\uc740 \uae30\uc874 CLL \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uacfc \uacb0\ud569\ud560 \ub54c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubcf4\uc644 \ub808\uc774\ube14 \ud559\uc2b5(CLL), \uc989 \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4\uac00 \uc18d\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4\ub97c \ud45c\uc2dc\ud558\ub294 \ub808\uc774\ube14\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc57d\ud55c \uac10\ub3c5 \ud559\uc2b5(WSL)\uc758 \uc804\ubb38\ud654\ub41c \ud615\uc2dd\uc758 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub300\uc548 \uac10\ub3c5\uc740 \ubcf4\uc644 \ub808\uc774\ube14\uc744 \uc218\uc9d1\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub354 \uc800\ub834\ud558\uace0 \ub178\ub3d9 \uc9d1\uc57d\uc801\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \ub9e4\ub825\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 CLL \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc190\uc2e4 \ud568\uc218\uc758 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc5d0 \uc911\uc810\uc744 \ub450\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc99d\uac15\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc740 \uc544\uc9c1 \ub300\uccb4\ub85c \ud0d0\uad6c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 Mixup \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc99d\uac15 \uae30\ubc95\uc774 CLL\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uc811 \uc801\uc6a9\ub420 \ub54c \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc784\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2ec\uce35 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 Mixup\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \ubcf4\uc644 \ub808\uc774\ube14 \ub178\uc774\uc988\uac00 CLL \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0 \ubd80\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce5c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7f0 \ub2e4\uc74c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub178\uc774\uc988 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc644\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc778\uc811\ud55c \uc608\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub9cc \uc99d\uac15 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud569\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uac1c\uc120\ub41c \uae30\ubc95\uc778 Intra-Cluster Mixup(ICM)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Specifically,\nwe use AlphaEvolve (an LLM coding agent) to study two settings:\n  a) Average-case hardness for MAX-CUT and MAX-Independent Set: We improve a\nrecent result of Kunisky and Yu to obtain near-optimal upper and (conditional)\nlower bounds on certification algorithms for MAX-CUT and MAX-Independent Set on\nrandom 3- and 4-regular graphs. Our improved lower bounds are obtained by\nconstructing nearly extremal Ramanujan graphs on as many as $163$ nodes, using\nAlphaEvolve. Additionally, via analytical arguments we strengthen the upper\nbounds to settle the computational hardness of these questions up to an error\nin the third decimal place.\n  b) Worst-case Hardness of Approximation for MAX-k-CUT: We obtain new\ninapproximability results, proving that it is NP-hard to approximate MAX-4-CUT\nand MAX-3-CUT within factors of $0.987$ and $0.9649$ respectively, using\nAlphaEvolve to discover new gadget reductions. Our MAX-4-CUT result improves\nupon the SOTA of $0.9883$, and our MAX-3-CUT result improves on the current\nbest gadget-based inapproximability result of $0.9853$, but falls short of\nimproving the SOTA of $16/17$ that relies on a custom PCP, rather than a gadget\nreduction from \"standard\" H{\\aa}stad-style PCPs.\n  A key technical challenge we faced: verifying a candidate construction\nproduced by AlphaEvolve is costly (often requiring exponential time).

However, currently available open-source dLLMs\noften generate at much lower rates, typically decoding only a single token at\nevery denoising timestep in order to maximize output quality. We present\nSpiffy, a speculative decoding algorithm that accelerates dLLM inference by\n$\\mathbf{2.8{-}3.1\\times}$ while provably preserving the model's output\ndistribution. This work addresses the unique challenges involved in applying\nideas from speculative decoding of AR-LLMs to the dLLM setting. Spiffy proposes\ndraft states by leveraging the dLLM's distribution itself in an\nauto-speculative manner. This approach is efficient and effective, and\neliminates the overheads of training and running an independent draft model. To\nstructure the candidate draft states, we propose a novel directed draft graph\nwhich is uniquely designed to take advantage of the bidirectional, block-wise\nnature of dLLM generation and can be verified in parallel by the dLLM. To\nfurther optimize the structure of these draft graphs, we introduce an\nefficient, offline calibration algorithm that procedurally determines\nhigh-quality graph configurations. These optimized draft graphs, enabling\nincreased acceptance rates, lead to a significant boost in the overall speedup\nachieved by the system. Crucially, Spiffy is also complementary to other recent\ninnovations in improving dLLM generation speeds such as KV-caching and\nmulti-token unmasking. We demonstrate that when combined with such parallel\ndecoding algorithms, Spiffy is able to effectively multiply the benefits of\nthese methods leading to total speedups of up to $\\mathbf{7.9\\times}$.", "AI": {"tldr": "Spiffy\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc608\uce21 \ub514\ucf54\ub529 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec, dLLM\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \uc18d\ub3c4\ub97c 2.8~3.1\ubc30 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "dLLM\uc758 \ub192\uc740 \ud1a0\ud070 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc18d\ub3c4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub418, \ud488\uc9c8 \uc800\ud558 \uc5c6\uc774 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub514\ucf54\ub529\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "dLLM\uc758 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \uc790\ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \ucd08\uc548 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ubc29\ud5a5\uc131 \ucd08\uc548 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uba70, \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uad50\uc815 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub41c \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uad6c\uc131\uc744 \uacb0\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "Spiffy\ub294 dLLM \ucd94\ub860 \uc18d\ub3c4\ub97c 2.8~3.1\ubc30 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba70, KV-\uce90\uc2f1 \ubc0f \uba40\ud2f0 \ud1a0\ud070 \uc5b8\ub9c8\uc2a4\ud0b9\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud601\uc2e0\ub4e4\uacfc \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ucd5c\ub300 7.9\ubc30\uc758 \uc804\uccb4 \uc18d\ub3c4 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Spiffy\ub294 dLLM\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \uc18d\ub3c4\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c, \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uacfc\uc758 \uacb0\ud569\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud601\uc2e0\uc801\uc778 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc774\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc \ud655\uc0b0 LLM(dLLM)\uc740 \uc790\uac00 \ud68c\uadc0 LLM(AR-LLM)\uc758 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ub300\uc548\uc73c\ub85c \ubd80\uc0c1\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \ub192\uc740 \ud1a0\ud070 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc18d\ub3c4\ub85c \uc791\ub3d9\ud560 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uc9c0\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ud604\uc7ac \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc624\ud508 \uc18c\uc2a4 dLLM\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd9c\ub825 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub9e4 \ub514\ub178\uc774\uc9d5 \ud0c0\uc784\uc2a4\ud15d\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e8\uc77c \ud1a0\ud070\ub9cc\uc744 \ub514\ucf54\ub529\ud558\uc5ec \ud6e8\uc52c \ub0ae\uc740 \ube44\uc728\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 dLLM \ucd94\ub860\uc744 2.8-3.1\ubc30 \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ucd9c\ub825 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \uc99d\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uc608\uce21 \ub514\ucf54\ub529 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc778 Spiffy\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 AR-LLM\uc758 \uc608\uce21 \ub514\ucf54\ub529 \uc544\uc774\ub514\uc5b4\ub97c dLLM \uc124\uc815\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc218\ubc18\ub418\ub294 \ub3c5\ud2b9\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804\uc5d0 \ub300\uc751\ud55c\ub2e4.
