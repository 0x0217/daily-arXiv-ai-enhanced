While this integration\nleverages rich relational information to improve task performance, their\nrobustness against adversarial attacks remains unexplored. We take the first\nstep to explore the vulnerabilities of graph-aware LLMs by leveraging existing\nadversarial attack methods tailored for graph-based models, including those for\npoisoning (training-time attacks) and evasion (test-time attacks), on two\nrepresentative models, LLAGA (Chen et al. 2024) and GRAPHPROMPTER (Liu et al.\n2024). Additionally, we discover a new attack surface for LLAGA where an\nattacker can inject malicious nodes as placeholders into the node sequence\ntemplate to severely degrade its performance. Our systematic analysis reveals\nthat certain design choices in graph encoding can enhance attack success, with\nspecific findings that: (1) the node sequence template in LLAGA increases its\nvulnerability; (2) the GNN encoder used in GRAPHPROMPTER demonstrates greater\nrobustness; and (3) both approaches remain susceptible to imperceptible feature\nperturbation attacks.

In this work,\nwe investigate the classical hardness of SDLP across different finite group\nplatforms. We establish that the group-case SDLP can be reformulated as a\ngeneralized discrete logarithm problem, enabling adaptation of classical\nalgorithms to study its complexity. We present a concrete adaptation of the\nBaby-Step Giant-Step algorithm for SDLP, achieving time and space complexity\n$O(\\sqrt{r})$ where $r$ is the period of the underlying cycle structure.\nThrough theoretical analysis and experimental validation in SageMath, we\ndemonstrate that the classical hardness of SDLP is highly platform-dependent\nand does not uniformly exceed that of standard DLP.

This\npaper introduces a novel path-planning problem, congestion mitigation path\nplanning (CMPP), which embeds congestion directly into the cost function,\ndefined by the usage of incoming edges along agents' paths. CMPP assigns a\nflow-based multiplicative penalty to each vertex of a sparse graph, which grows\nsteeply where frequently-traversed paths intersect, capturing the intuition\nthat congestion intensifies where many agents enter the same area from\ndifferent directions. Minimizing the total cost yields a set of coarse-level,\ntime-independent routes that autonomous agents can follow while applying their\nown local collision avoidance. We formulate the problem and develop two\nsolvers: (i) an exact mixed-integer nonlinear programming solver for small\ninstances, and (ii) a scalable two-layer search algorithm, A-CMTS, which\nquickly finds suboptimal solutions for large-scale instances and iteratively\nrefines them toward the optimum. Empirical studies show that augmenting\nstate-of-the-art collision-avoidance planners with CMPP significantly reduces\nlocal congestion and enhances system throughput in both discrete- and\ncontinuous-space scenarios.

LumiGen comprises an\nIntelligent Prompt Parsing & Augmentation (IPPA) module for proactive prompt\nenhancement and an Iterative Visual Feedback & Refinement (IVFR) module, which\nacts as a \"visual critic\" to iteratively correct and optimize generated images.\nEvaluated on the challenging LongBench-T2I Benchmark, LumiGen achieves a\nsuperior average score of 3.08, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.\nNotably, our framework demonstrates significant improvements in critical\ndimensions such as text rendering and pose expression, validating the\neffectiveness of LVLM integration for more controllable and higher-quality\nimage generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "LumiGen\uc740 LVLM\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec T2I \ubaa8\ub378 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ub80c\ub354\ub9c1 \ubc0f \ud3ec\uc988 \ud45c\ud604\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90c.", "motivation": "T2I \uc0dd\uc131\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc9c0\uc2dc \ucc98\ub9ac \ubc0f \uc138\ubc00\ud55c \ub0b4\uc6a9 \uc81c\uc5b4\uc758 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud568.", "method": "LumiGen\uc740 Intelligent Prompt Parsing & Augmentation (IPPA) \ubaa8\ub4c8\uacfc Iterative Visual Feedback & Refinement (IVFR) \ubaa8\ub4c8\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub428.", "result": "LumiGen\uc740 LongBench-T2I Benchmark\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uade0 3.08 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \uae30\ub85d\ud558\uba70 \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uae30\uc220\uc744 \ucd08\uc6d4\ud568.", "conclusion": "LVLM \ud1b5\ud569\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc5ec \ub354 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uace0\ud488\uc9c8\uc758 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc2e4\ud604\ud568."}}

It is\nrapidly evolving into a general-purpose infrastructure that reshapes how\nknowledge is generated, mediated, and validated. This paper presents findings\nfrom a controlled experiment evaluating a Socratic AI Tutor, a large language\nmodel designed to scaffold student research question development through\nstructured dialogue grounded in constructivist theory. Conducted with 65\npre-service teacher students in Germany, the study compares interaction with\nthe Socratic Tutor to engagement with an uninstructed AI chatbot. Students\nusing the Socratic Tutor reported significantly greater support for critical,\nindependent, and reflective thinking, suggesting that dialogic AI can stimulate\nmetacognitive engagement and challenging recent narratives of de-skilling due\nto generative AI usage. These findings serve as a proof of concept for a\nbroader pedagogical shift: the use of multi-agent systems (MAS) composed of\nspecialised AI agents. To conceptualise this, we introduce the notion of\norchestrated MAS, modular, pedagogically aligned agent constellations, curated\nby educators, that support diverse learning trajectories through differentiated\nroles and coordinated interaction. To anchor this shift, we propose an adapted\noffer-and-use model, in which students appropriate instructional offers from\nthese agents. Beyond technical feasibility, we examine system-level\nimplications for higher education institutions and students, including funding\nnecessities, changes to faculty roles, curriculars, competencies and assessment\npractices.

However, most existing benchmarks evaluate large-language-model\nreasoning under idealized settings, overlooking performance in realistic,\nnon-ideal scenarios. We identify three representative non-ideal scenarios with\npractical relevance: summary inference, fine-grained noise suppression, and\ncontextual filtering. We introduce a new research direction guided by\nbrain-science findings that human reasoning remains reliable under imperfect\ninputs. We formally define and evaluate these challenging scenarios. We\nfine-tune three LLMs and a state-of-the-art large vision-language model (LVLM)\nusing RL with a representative policy-gradient algorithm and then test their\nperformance on eight public datasets. Our results reveal that while RL\nfine-tuning improves baseline reasoning under idealized settings, performance\ndeclines significantly across all three non-ideal scenarios, exposing critical\nlimitations in advanced reasoning capabilities.

While recent advanced large reasoning models like\nDeepSeek-R1 employ reinforcement learning for an extended ``thinking'' process,\ntheir reasoning can be verbose and lack relevance. We introduce AttriLens-Mol,\nan attribute-guided reinforcement learning framework for molecular property\nprediction with LLMs. AttriLens-Mol steers the model's reasoning by using: (1)\na format reward encouraging attribute-based structured output, (2) a count\nreward to avoid enumerating irrelevant attributes, and (3) a rationality reward\nusing advanced LLMs and RDKit to verify the relatedness of the generated\nattributes. This approach implicitly elicits the model's inherent knowledge of\nrelevant molecular attributes during reasoning, enables making predictions for\nthe molecular property more effectively.

Existing methods for\nmultimodal time series forecasting often neglect the inherent perturbations\nwithin textual data, where irrelevant, noisy, or ambiguous content can\nsignificantly degrade model performance, particularly when the noise exhibits\nvarying intensity or stems from structural inconsistencies. To address this\nchallenge, we propose PA-RNet (Perturbation-Aware Reasoning Network for\nMultimodal Time Series Forecasting), a robust multimodal forecasting framework.\nPA-RNet features a perturbation-aware projection module and a cross-modal\nattention mechanism to effectively separate noise from the textual embeddings\nwhile maintaining semantically meaningful representations, thereby enhancing\nthe model's generalization ability.

To address this issue, we propose a novel game-theoretic\nframework that models the protein-ligand interaction as a two-player game\ncalled the Docking Game, with the ligand docking module acting as the ligand\nplayer and the protein pocket docking module as the protein player. To solve\nthis game, we develop a novel Loop Self-Play (LoopPlay) algorithm, which\nalternately trains these players through a two-level loop. In the outer loop,\nthe players exchange predicted poses, allowing each to incorporate the other's\nstructural predictions, which fosters mutual adaptation over multiple\niterations.

We introduce InfoQ, a novel framework for MPQ that is training-free in\nthe bit-width search phase.

Recent advancements in large\nlanguage models (LLMs) suggest a complementary approach, where implicit prior\nknowledge and clinical heuristics are naturally embedded through linguistic\nprompts without requiring environment-specific training. In this study, we\nrigorously evaluate open-source LLMs as dynamic insulin dosing agents in an in\nsilico Type 1 diabetes simulator, comparing their zero-shot inference\nperformance against small neural network-based RL agents (SRAs) explicitly\ntrained for the task. Our results indicate that carefully designed zero-shot\nprompts enable smaller LLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B) to achieve comparable or\nsuperior clinical performance relative to extensively trained SRAs,\nparticularly in stable patient cohorts.

Despite advances in AI, developing universal, fast, and stable\ngate sizing methods for analog circuits remains a significant challenge. Recent\napproaches combine Large Language Models (LLMs) with heuristic search\ntechniques to enhance generalizability, but they often depend on large model\nsizes and lack portability across different technology nodes. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose EasySize, the first lightweight gate sizing framework\nbased on a finetuned Qwen3-8B model, designed for universal applicability\nacross process nodes, design specifications, and circuit topologies. EasySize\nexploits the varying Ease of Attainability (EOA) of performance metrics to\ndynamically construct task-specific loss functions, enabling efficient\nheuristic search through global Differential Evolution (DE) and local Particle\nSwarm Optimization (PSO) within a feedback-enhanced flow.

We present a comprehensive theoretical and\nempirical analysis of replicability in transfer learning, introducing a\nmathematical framework that quantifies the fundamental trade-off between\nadaptation effectiveness and result consistency. Our key contribution is the\nformalization of selection sensitivity ($\\Delta_Q$), a measure that captures\nhow adaptive selection strategies respond to perturbations in training data. We\nprove that replicability failure probability: the likelihood that two\nindependent training runs produce models differing in performance by more than\na threshold, increases quadratically with selection sensitivity while\ndecreasing exponentially with sample size. Through extensive experiments on the\nMultiNLI corpus using six adaptive selection strategies - ranging from uniform\nsampling to gradient-based selection - we demonstrate that this theoretical\nrelationship holds precisely in practice.

Negative Correlation Learning (NCL) introduces a penalty to manage\nthis trade-off but suffers from loose theoretical bounds and limited adjustment\nrange. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework called\nSelf-Error Adjustment (SEA), which decomposes ensemble errors into two distinct\ncomponents: individual performance terms, representing the self-error of each\nbase learner, and diversity terms, reflecting interactions among learners. This\ndecomposition allows us to introduce an adjustable parameter into the loss\nfunction, offering precise control over the contribution of each component,\nthus enabling finer regulation of ensemble performance. Compared to NCL and its\nvariants, SEA provides a broader range of effective adjustments and more\nconsistent changes in diversity. Furthermore, we establish tighter theoretical\nbounds for adjustable ensemble methods and validate them through empirical\nexperiments.

However, enhancing these capabilities through\npost-training remains resource intensive, particularly in terms of data and\ncomputational cost. Although recent efforts have sought to improve sample\nefficiency through selective data curation, existing methods often rely on\nheuristic or task-specific strategies that hinder scalability. In this work, we\nintroduce InfiAlign, a scalable and sample-efficient post-training framework\nthat integrates supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with Direct Preference\nOptimization (DPO) to align LLMs for enhanced reasoning. At the core of\nInfiAlign is a robust data selection pipeline that automatically curates\nhigh-quality alignment data from open-source reasoning datasets using\nmultidimensional quality metrics. This pipeline enables significant performance\ngains while drastically reducing data requirements and remains extensible to\nnew data sources. When applied to the Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Base model, our SFT model\nachieves performance on par with DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, while using only\napproximately 12% of the training data, and demonstrates strong generalization\nacross diverse reasoning tasks. Additional improvements are obtained through\nthe application of DPO, with particularly notable gains in mathematical\nreasoning tasks.

As AI systems begin to exhaust\nhigh-quality training data and rely on increasingly large human workforces for\nreward design, the current paradigm faces significant scalability challenges\nthat could impede progress toward genuinely autonomous intelligence. The\nproposal for an ``Era of Experience,'' where agents learn from self-generated\ndata, is a promising step forward. However, this vision still depends on\nextensive human engineering of reward functions, effectively shifting the\nbottleneck from data curation to reward curation. This highlights what we\nidentify as the \\textbf{grounded-agency gap}: the inability of contemporary AI\nsystems to autonomously formulate, adapt, and pursue objectives in response to\nchanging circumstances.

However, a fundamental\nquestion remains: how can we obtain better pre-trained weights that encapsulate\nmore knowledge beyond the given dataset? In this work, we introduce\n\\textbf{KNowledge Overflowed Weights (KNOW)} prediction, a novel strategy that\nleverages structured forgetting and its inversion to synthesize\nknowledge-enriched weights. Our key insight is that sequential fine-tuning on\nprogressively downsized datasets induces a structured forgetting process, which\ncan be modeled and reversed to recover knowledge as if trained on a larger\ndataset. We construct a dataset of weight transitions governed by this\ncontrolled forgetting and employ meta-learning to model weight prediction\neffectively.

This challenge is\nparticularly acute in computational social systems and economic analysis, where\nlabeled data is often scarce, expensive, and subject to expert noise. To\naddress this gap, we propose a novel framework for cold-start active preference\nlearning. Our method initiates the learning process through a self-supervised\npre-training phase, utilizing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to derive\ninitial pseudo-labels from the data's inherent structure, thereby creating a\ncold-start model without any initial oracle interaction. Subsequently, the\nmodel is refined through an active learning loop that strategically queries a\nsimulated noisy oracle for labels. We conduct extensive experiments on diverse\ndatasets from different domains, including financial credibility, career\nsuccess rate, and socio-economic status. The results demonstrate that our\ncold-start approach outperforms standard active learning strategies that begin\nfrom a blank slate, achieving higher accuracy with substantially fewer labeled\npairs. Our framework offers a practical and effective solution to mitigate the\ncold-start problem, enhancing the sample efficiency and applicability of\npreference learning in data-constrained environments.

In such cases, Weakly Supervised Learning (WSL), which enables\ntraining with incomplete or imprecise supervision, provides a practical and\neffective solution.

In this paper, we propose a novel WSL\nframework that leverages complementary weak supervision signals from multiple\nrelational perspectives, which can be especially valuable when labeled data is\nlimited. Specifically, we introduce SconfConfDiff Classification, a method that\nintegrates two distinct forms of weaklabels: similarity-confidence and\nconfidence-difference, which are assigned to unlabeled data pairs. To implement\nthis method, we derive two types of unbiased risk estimators for\nclassification: one based on a convex combination of existing estimators, and\nanother newly designed by modeling the interaction between two weak labels. We\nprove that both estimators achieve optimal convergence rates with respect to\nestimation error bounds. Furthermore, we introduce a risk correction approach\nto mitigate overfitting caused by negative empirical risk, and provide\ntheoretical analysis on the robustness of the proposed method against\ninaccurate class prior probability and label noise.

Comprehensive experiments on three AAD benchmarks (KUL, DTU and\nAV-GC-AAD) across three settings (within-trial, cross-trial and cross-subject)\ndemonstrate that S$^2$M-Former achieves comparable state-of-the-art (SOTA)\ndecoding accuracy, making it a promising low-power, high-performance solution\nfor AAD tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "S$^2$M-Former\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 spiking symmetric mixing \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 EEG \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uccad\uac01 \uc8fc\uc758\ub825 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uac00 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uace0 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "motivation": "EEG \uae30\ubc18 \uccad\uac01 \uc8fc\uc758\ub825 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uccad\uac01 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uccad\ucde8\uc790\uc758 \uc9d1\uc911\ub825\uc744 \ub514\ucf54\ub529\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud55c\ub370, \ud604\uc7ac \uae30\uc220\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "spike-driven \ub300\uce6d \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc640 \uacbd\ub7c9 1D \ud1a0\ud070 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec, \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130\ub97c \ub300\ud3ed \uc904\uc774\uace0 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc18c\ube44\ub97c \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "S$^2$M-Former\ub294 \ucd5c\uadfc\uc758 ANN \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 5.8\ubc30 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc18c\ube44\ub97c \uc904\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uae30\uc874 SNN \uae30\uc900\uc744 \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc885\ud569 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, S$^2$M-Former\ub294 AAD \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc800\uc804\ub825 \ubc0f \uace0\uc131\ub2a5 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc73c\ub85c\uc11c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \uac70\ub450\uc5c8\ub2e4."}}

Propensity score-based weighting methods are widely used to\naddress this issue by reweighting samples to simulate a randomized controlled\ntrial (RCT). However, the effectiveness of these methods heavily depends on the\nobserved data and the accuracy of the propensity score estimator. For example,\ninverse propensity weighting (IPW) assigns weights based on the inverse of the\npropensity score, which can lead to instable weights when propensity scores\nhave high variance-either due to data or model misspecification-ultimately\ndegrading the ability of handling selection bias and treatment effect\nestimation. To overcome these limitations, we propose Deconfounding Factor\nWeighting (DFW), a novel propensity score-based approach that leverages the\ndeconfounding factor-to construct stable and effective sample weights. DFW\nprioritizes less confounded samples while mitigating the influence of highly\nconfounded ones, producing a pseudopopulation that better approximates a RCT.\nOur approach ensures bounded weights, lower variance, and improved covariate\nbalance.While DFW is formulated for binary treatments, it naturally extends to\nmulti-treatment settings, as the deconfounding factor is computed based on the\nestimated probability of the treatment actually received by each sample.\nThrough extensive experiments on real-world benchmark and synthetic datasets,\nwe demonstrate that DFW outperforms existing methods, including IPW and CBPS,\nin both covariate balancing and treatment effect estimation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uad00\ucc30 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \uc778\uacfc \ud6a8\uacfc \ucd94\uc815\uc740 \uc120\ud0dd \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6cc\uc9c4\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\ub294 Deconfounding Factor Weighting(DFW) \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc0d8\ud50c \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub97c \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc120\ud0dd \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uce58\ub8cc \uadf8\ub8f9 \uac04\uc758 \ubd88\uade0\ud615\ud55c \uacf5\ubcc0\ub7c9 \ubd84\ud3ec \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0\uc744 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "DFW\ub294 \ud0c8\ud63c\ub780 \uc694\uc778\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc548\uc815\ub41c \uc0d8\ud50c \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uace0\ud63c\ub780 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc758 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc904\uc778\ub2e4.", "result": "DFW\ub294 \uacf5\ubcc0\ub7c9 \uade0\ud615 \ubc0f \uce58\ub8cc \ud6a8\uacfc \ucd94\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "DFW\ub294 \uc774\uc9c4 \uce58\ub8cc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub418\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc5ec\ub7ec \uce58\ub8cc \uc124\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7fd\uac8c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\ub2e4."}}

Despite offering strong performance\nand computational efficiency, large MoE-based LLMs like DeepSeek-V3-0324 and\nKimi-K2-Instruct present serious challenges due to substantial memory\nrequirements in deployment. While recent works have explored MoE compression to\naddress this issue, existing methods often suffer from considerable accuracy\ndrops (e.g., 7-14% relatively) even at modest compression rates. This paper\nintroduces a novel Mixture-of-Basis-Experts (MoBE) method that achieves model\ncompression while incurring minimal accuracy drops. Specifically, each up/gate\nmatrix in an expert is decomposed via a rank decomposition as W = AB, where\nmatrix A is unique to each expert.

However,\nlearning from scratch is often too costly for personalization tasks where a\nsingle individual faces only a small number of decision points. Latent bandits\noffer substantially reduced exploration times for such problems, given that the\njoint distribution of a latent state and the rewards of actions is known and\naccurate. In practice, finding such a model is non-trivial, and there may not\nexist a small number of latent states that explain the responses of all\nindividuals. For example, patients with similar latent conditions may have the\nsame preference in treatments but rate their symptoms on different scales. With\nthis in mind, we propose relaxing the assumptions of latent bandits to require\nonly a model of the \\emph{preference ordering} of actions in each latent state.\nThis allows problem instances with the same latent state to vary in their\nreward distributions, as long as their preference orderings are equal. We give\na posterior-sampling algorithm for this problem and demonstrate that its\nempirical performance is competitive with latent bandits that have full\nknowledge of the reward distribution when this is well-specified, and\noutperforms them when reward scales differ between instances with the same\nlatent state.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \ubc34\ub527 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \uac00\uc815\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\uc5ec, \ud589\ub3d9\uc758 \uc120\ud638 \uc21c\uc11c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9cc \uc694\uad6c\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uac1c\uc778\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\uc758 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \ub2e8\ucd95\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uac1c\uc778\ud654 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud559\uc2b5 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub108\ubb34 \ub192\uace0, \uc801\uc740 \uc218\uc758 \uacb0\uc815 \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5f0\uad6c\uac00 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc838\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810.", "method": "\ud589\ub3d9\uc758 \uc120\ud638 \uc21c\uc11c\ub97c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \ubc34\ub527\uc758 \uac00\uc815\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud574 \ud6c4\ud589 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ud6c4\ud589 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \uc798 \uc815\uc758\ub41c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \ubc34\ub527\uacfc \uacbd\uc7c1\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ucc99\ub3c4\uac00 \ub2e4\ub978 \uacbd\uc6b0 \ub354 \uc88b\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub530\ub77c\uc11c, \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub354 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uba70 \uc720\uc6a9\ud558\ub2e4."}}

However, they impose a rigid constraint: equal mean\nand variance, which fails to reflect the true stochastic nature of neural\nactivity. In this work, we challenge this constraint and introduce NegBio-VAE,\na principled extension of the VAE framework that models spike counts using the\nnegative binomial distribution.

However,\nVFL typically faces two key challenges: i) the requirement for perfectly\naligned data samples across all clients (missing features are not allowed); ii)\nthe requirement for joint collaborative inference/prediction involving all\nclients (it does not support locally independent inference on a single client).\nTo address these challenges, we propose X-VFL, a new VFL framework designed to\ndeal with the non-aligned data samples with (partially) missing features and to\nsupport locally independent inference of new data samples for each client. In\nparticular, we design two novel modules in X-VFL: Cross Completion (XCom) and\nDecision Subspace Alignment (DS-Align). XCom can complete/reconstruct missing\nfeatures for non-aligned data samples by leveraging information from other\nclients. DS-Align aligns local features with completed and global features\nacross all clients within the decision subspace, thus enabling locally\nindependent inference at each client.
