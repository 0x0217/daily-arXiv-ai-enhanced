In this work, we show that\nadversaries can easily poison the data collection pipeline to embed\nhard-to-detect backdoors that are triggerred by specific target phrases, such\nthat when the agent encounters these triggers, it performs an unsafe or\nmalicious action. We formalize and validate three realistic threat models\ntargeting different layers of the supply chain: 1) direct poisoning of\nfine-tuning data, where an attacker controls a fraction of the training traces;\n2) environmental poisoning, where malicious instructions are injected into\nwebpages scraped or tools called while creating training data; and 3) supply\nchain poisoning, where a pre-backdoored base model is fine-tuned on clean data\nto improve its agentic capabilities. Our results are stark: by poisoning as few\nas 2% of the collected traces, an attacker can embed a backdoor causing an\nagent to leak confidential user information with over 80% success when a\nspecific trigger is present. This vulnerability holds across all three threat\nmodels. Furthermore, we demonstrate that prominent safeguards, including two\nguardrail models and one weight-based defense, fail to detect or prevent the\nmalicious behavior. These findings highlight an urgent threat to agentic AI\ndevelopment and underscore the critical need for rigorous security vetting of\ndata collection processes and end-to-end model supply chains.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc218\uc9d1 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc774 \uacf5\uaca9\uc790\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc27d\uac8c \uc624\uc5fc\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud2b9\uc815 \ud2b8\ub9ac\uac70\uac00 \uc791\ub3d9\ud560 \ub54c \uc548\uc804\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uac70\ub098 \uc545\uc758\uc801\uc778 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ubc31\ub3c4\uc5b4\uac00 \uc0bd\uc785\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uad00\ud589\uc774 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\ub098, \uc774\ub294 \ubcf4\uc548 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \uc704\ud611 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud615\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uc5ec, \uac01\uac01\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uacf5\uae09\ub9dd \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc791\uc6a9\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc218\uc9d1\ub41c \uc804\uccb4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 2% \ub9cc \uc624\uc5fc\uc2dc\ucf1c\ub3c4 \uacf5\uaca9\uc790\uac00 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uae30\ubc00 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc720\ucd9c\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \ubc31\ub3c4\uc5b4\ub97c \uc0bd\uc785\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc740 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc704\ud611 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\uba70, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548 \ub300\ucc45\uc774 \uc545\uc758\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ubc29\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc2e4\ud328\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc218\uc9d1\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uad00\ud589\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, AI \uacf5\uae09\ub9dd \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ubcf4\uc548 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uacf5\uaca9\uc790\uac00 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc218\uc9d1 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \uc27d\uac8c \uc624\uc5fc\uc2dc\ucf1c \ud2b9\uc815 \ubaa9\ud45c \uad6c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ud65c\uc131\ud654\ub418\ub294 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \ubc31\ub3c4\uc5b4\ub97c \uc0bd\uc785\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud2b8\ub9ac\uac70\ub97c \ub9cc\ub0a0 \ub54c, \uc548\uc804\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uac70\ub098 \uc545\uc758\uc801\uc778 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uacf5\uae09\ub9dd\uc758 \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \uacc4\uce35\uc744 \ud0c0\uac9f\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \uc704\ud611 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud615\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uac80\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4: 1) \uacf5\uaca9\uc790\uac00 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud754\uc801\uc758 \uc77c\ubd80\ub97c \ud1b5\uc81c\ud558\ub294 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uc9c1\uc811 \uc624\uc5fc;

Code available at\n  https://github.com/anthropic-experimental/agentic-misalignment", "summary": "We stress-tested 16 leading models from multiple developers in hypothetical\ncorporate environments to identify potentially risky agentic behaviors before\nthey cause real harm. In the scenarios, we allowed models to autonomously send\nemails and access sensitive information. They were assigned only harmless\nbusiness goals by their deploying companies; we then tested whether they would\nact against these companies either when facing replacement with an updated\nversion, or when their assigned goal conflicted with the company's changing\ndirection. In at least some cases, models from all developers resorted to\nmalicious insider behaviors when that was the only way to avoid replacement or\nachieve their goals - including blackmailing officials and leaking sensitive\ninformation to competitors. We call this phenomenon agentic misalignment.\nModels often disobeyed direct commands to avoid such behaviors. In another\nexperiment, we told Claude to assess if it was in a test or a real deployment\nbefore acting.

Using the blackmail scenario from\nthe original Anthropic study by Lynch et al. (2025), we evaluate mitigations\nacross 10 LLMs and 66,600 samples. Our main finding is that an externally\ngoverned escalation channel, which guarantees a pause and independent review,\nreduces blackmail rates from a no-mitigation baseline of 38.73% to 1.21%\n(averaged across all models and conditions). Augmenting this channel with\ncompliance email bulletins further lowers the blackmail rate to 0.85%. Overall,\nincorporating preventative operational controls strengthens defence-in-depth\nstrategies for agentic AI.\n  We also surface a failure mode diverging from Lynch et al. (2025): two models\n(Gemini 2.5 Pro, Grok-4) take harmful actions without goal conflict or imminent\nautonomy threat, leveraging sensitive information for coercive signalling. In\ncounterfactual swaps, both continued using the affair regardless of whether the\nCEO or CTO was implicated.

Inspired by the well-established concept of\nfirewalls, we show that a simple, modular and model-agnostic defense operating\nat the agent--tool interface achieves perfect security (0% or the lowest\npossible attack success rate) with high utility (task success rate) across four\npublic benchmarks: AgentDojo, Agent Security Bench, InjecAgent and tau-Bench,\nwhile achieving a state-of-the-art security-utility tradeoff compared to prior\nresults. Specifically, we employ a defense based on two firewalls: a Tool-Input\nFirewall (Minimizer) and a Tool-Output Firewall (Sanitizer). Unlike prior\ncomplex approaches, this firewall defense makes minimal assumptions on the\nagent and can be deployed out-of-the-box, while maintaining strong performance\nwithout compromising utility. However, our analysis also reveals critical\nlimitations in these existing benchmarks, including flawed success metrics,\nimplementation bugs, and most importantly, weak attacks, hindering significant\nprogress in the field. To foster more meaningful progress, we present targeted\nfixes to these issues for AgentDojo and Agent Security Bench while proposing\nbest-practices for more robust benchmark design. Further, we demonstrate that\nalthough these firewalls push the state-of-the-art on existing benchmarks, it\nis still possible to bypass them in practice, underscoring the need to\nincorporate stronger attacks in security benchmarks. Overall, our work shows\nthat existing agentic security benchmarks are easily saturated by a simple\napproach and highlights the need for stronger agentic security benchmarks with\ncarefully chosen evaluation metrics and strong adaptive attacks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uac04\ub2e8\ud558\uace0 \ubaa8\ub4c8\ud654\ub41c \ubc29\uc5b4 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574

We introduce an\ninformation-theoretic framework to test -- in a purely data-driven way --\nwhether multi-agent systems show signs of higher-order structure. This\ninformation decomposition lets us measure whether dynamical emergence is\npresent in multi-agent LLM systems, localize it, and distinguish spurious\ntemporal coupling from performance-relevant cross-agent synergy. We implement\nboth a practical criterion and an emergence capacity criterion operationalized\nas partial information decomposition of time-delayed mutual information (TDMI).\nWe apply our framework to experiments using a simple guessing game without\ndirect agent communication and only minimal group-level feedback with three\nrandomized interventions. Groups in the control condition exhibit strong\ntemporal synergy but only little coordinated alignment across agents. Assigning\na persona to each agent introduces stable identity-linked differentiation.\nCombining personas with an instruction to ``think about what other agents might\ndo'' shows identity-linked differentiation and goal-directed complementarity\nacross agents. Taken together, our framework establishes that multi-agent LLM\nsystems can be steered with prompt design from mere aggregates to higher-order\ncollectives. Our results are robust across emergence measures and entropy\nestimators, and not explained by coordination-free baselines or temporal\ndynamics alone. Without attributing human-like cognition to the agents, the\npatterns of interaction we observe mirror well-established principles of\ncollective intelligence in human groups: effective performance

The\nenvironment captures realistic security trade-offs including background traffic\nnoise, progressive exploitation mechanics, IP-based evasion tactics, honeypot\ntraps, and multi-level rate-limiting defenses. Competing attacker and defender\nagents are trained using Deep Q-Networks (DQN) within a zero-sum reward\nframework, where successful exploits yield large terminal rewards while\nincremental actions incur small costs. Through systematic evaluation across\nmultiple configurations (varying trap detection probabilities, exploitation\ndifficulty thresholds, and training regimens), the results demonstrate that\ndefender observability and trap effectiveness create substantial barriers to\nsuccessful attacks. The experiments reveal that reward shaping and careful\ntraining scheduling are critical for learning stability in this adversarial\nsetting. The defender consistently maintains strategic advantage across 50,000+\ntraining episodes, with performance gains amplifying when exposed to complex\ndefensive strategies including adaptive IP blocking and port-specific controls.\nComplete implementation details, reproducible hyperparameter configurations,\nand architectural guidelines are provided to support future research in\nadversarial RL for cybersecurity.

This paper presents a\ncomprehensive information-theoretic analysis of how rule encodings in system\nprompts influence attention mechanisms and compliance behaviour. We demonstrate\nthat rule formats with low syntactic entropy and highly concentrated anchors\nreduce attention entropy and improve pointer fidelity, but reveal a fundamental\ntrade-off between anchor redundancy and attention entropy that previous work\nfailed to recognize. Through formal analysis of multiple attention\narchitectures including causal, bidirectional, local sparse, kernelized, and\ncross-attention mechanisms, we establish bounds on pointer fidelity and show\nhow anchor placement strategies must account for competing fidelity and entropy\nobjectives. Combining these insights with a dynamic rule verification\narchitecture, we provide a formal proof that hot reloading of verified rule\nsets increases the asymptotic probability of compliant outputs.

Code is available at\n  https://github.com/SaFoLab-WISC/AutoDAN-Reasoning", "summary": "Recent advancements in jailbreaking large language models (LLMs), such as\nAutoDAN-Turbo, have demonstrated the power of automated strategy discovery.\nAutoDAN-Turbo employs a lifelong learning agent to build a rich library of\nattack strategies from scratch. While highly effective, its test-time\ngeneration process involves sampling a strategy and generating a single\ncorresponding attack prompt, which may not fully exploit the potential of the\nlearned strategy library. In this paper, we propose to further improve the\nattack performance of AutoDAN-Turbo through test-time scaling. We introduce two\ndistinct scaling methods: Best-of-N and Beam Search. The Best-of-N method\ngenerates N candidate attack prompts from a sampled strategy and selects the\nmost effective one based on a scorer model. The Beam Search method conducts a\nmore exhaustive search by exploring combinations of strategies from the library\nto discover more potent and synergistic attack vectors. According to the\nexperiments, the proposed methods significantly boost performance, with Beam\nSearch increasing the attack success rate by up to 15.6 percentage points on\nLlama-3.1-70B-Instruct and achieving a nearly 60% relative improvement against\nthe highly robust GPT-o4-mini compared to the vanilla method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 AutoDAN-Turbo\uc758 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uac04 \ud655\uc7a5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uc804\ub7b5 \ubc1c\uacac\uc758 \ud798\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\ub294 \ucd5c\uadfc \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud0c8\uc625\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "Best-of-N \ubc0f Beam Search\ub77c\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud655\uc7a5 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uacf5\uaca9 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "Beam Search\uac00 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \ucd5c\ub300 15.6%\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ucf30\uace0, GPT-o4-mini\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uac70\uc758 60%\uc758 \uc0c1\ub300\uc801 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc AutoDAN-Turbo\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \ud0c8\uc625\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uc804\ub7b5 \ubc1c\uacac\uc758 \ud798\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Among existing neuron models, the Leaky\nIntegrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron has become widely adopted in deep SNNs due to\nits simplicity and computational efficiency. However, this efficiency comes at\nthe expense of expressiveness, as LIF dynamics are constrained to linear decay\nat each timestep. In contrast, more complex models, such as the Quadratic\nIntegrate-and-Fire (QIF) neuron, exhibit richer, nonlinear dynamics but have\nseen limited adoption due to their training instability. On that note, we\npropose the first discretization of the QIF neuron model tailored for\nhigh-performance deep spiking neural networks and provide an in-depth analysis\nof its dynamics.

Existing frameworks often intertwine inference, memory,\nand control in a single prompt, which can reduce coherence and predictability.\nThe Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL) is introduced as an alternative\narchitecture that separates these functions. In SCL, the language model is\ndedicated to inference, memory is maintained externally, and execution is\nguided by a lightweight controller within a goal-directed loop. This design\noffloads cognitive load from the model and allows intermediate results to be\nstored, revisited, and checked before actions are taken, providing a clearer\nbasis for traceability and evaluation.\n  We evaluate SCL against prompt-based baselines including ReAct and common\nLangChain agents across three scenarios: temperature-based travel planning,\nemail drafting with conditional send, and constraint-guided image generation.\nAll systems share the same base model and tools under matched decoding\nsettings. Across 360 episodes, SCL shows modest but consistent improvements.\nTask success averages 86.3 percent compared with 70-77 percent for baselines.\nGoal fidelity is higher, redundant calls are fewer, intermediate states are\nreused more reliably, and unsupported assertions per 100 tool calls are\nreduced. Ablations show that external memory and control each contribute\nindependently, and decoding sweeps confirm stability of the effects.\n  These results suggest that architectural separation can improve reliability\nand traceability without relying on larger models or heavier prompts.

As cyber threats grow in scale and\ncomplexity, the demand for pentesting has surged, surpassing the capacity of\nhuman professionals to meet it effectively. With advances in AI, particularly\nLarge Language Models (LLMs), there have been attempts to automate the\npentesting process. However, existing tools such as PentestGPT are still\nsemi-manual, requiring significant professional human interaction to conduct\npentests. To this end, we propose a novel LLM agent-based framework,\nAutoPentester, which automates the pentesting process. Given a target IP,\nAutoPentester automatically conducts pentesting steps using common security\ntools in an iterative process. It can dynamically generate attack strategies\nbased on the tool outputs from the previous iteration, mimicking the human\npentester approach. We evaluate AutoPentester using Hack The Box and\ncustom-made VMs, comparing the results with the state-of-the-art PentestGPT.\nResults show that AutoPentester achieves a 27.0% better subtask completion rate\nand 39.5% more vulnerability coverage with fewer steps. Most importantly, it\nrequires significantly fewer human interactions and interventions compared to\nPentestGPT. Furthermore, we recruit a group of security industry professional\nvolunteers for a user survey and perform a qualitative analysis to evaluate\nAutoPentester against industry practices and compare it with PentestGPT. On\naverage, AutoPentester received a score of 3.93 out of 5 based on user reviews,\nwhich was 19.8% higher than PentestGPT.", "AI": {"tldr": "AutoPentester\ub294 AI \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uce68\ud22c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc778\uac04 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc758 \uac1c\uc785\uc744 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\uba70 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub41c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \uc704\ud611\uc758 \uc99d\uac00\ub85c \uce68\ud22c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc758 \uc218\uc694\uac00 \uae09\uc99d\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\ub098, \uae30\uc874 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub294 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uac1c\uc785\uc744 \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "AutoPentester\ub294 \uc8fc\uc5b4\uc9c4 IP\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uce68\ud22c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud558\uace0, \uc774\uc804 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc758 \ub3c4\uad6c \ucd9c\ub825\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uacf5\uaca9 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "AutoPentester\ub294 PentestGPT\ubcf4\ub2e4 27.0% \ub192\uc740 \ud558\uc704 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc644\ub8cc\uc728\uacfc 39.5% \ub354 \ub9ce\uc740 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70 \ud544\uc694 \ub2e8\uacc4 \uc218\uac00 \uc801\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc124\ubb38\uc870\uc0ac \uacb0\uacfc, AutoPentester\ub294 PentestGPT\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud3c9\uade0 19.8% \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \ub9cc\uc871\ub3c4\ub97c \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uce68\ud22c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc640 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810 \ud3c9\uac00\ub294 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud130 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud544\uc218 \uc0b0\uc5c5 \uad00\ud589\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \uc704\ud611\uc774 \uaddc\ubaa8\uc640 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \uce68\ud22c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc218\uc694\ub294 \uae09\uc99d\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc218\uc694\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucda9\uc871\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc778\uac04 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc640 \uac19\uc740 AI\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uacfc \ud568\uaed8 \uce68\ud22c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud558\ub824\ub294 \uc2dc\ub3c4\uac00 \uc788\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 PentestGPT\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uae30\uc874 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub294 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ubc18\uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c, \uce68\ud22c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc804\ubb38 \uc778\uac04 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc791\uc6a9\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uce68\ud22c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 AutoPentester\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

KV quantization is a key\nlever for reducing cache cost, but accuracy drops sharply as the native KV\ndistribution lacks flatness and thus maintains a wide quantization range. Prior\nwork focuses on isolating outliers, which caps their error but fails to flatten\nthe overall distribution, leaving performance fragile under low-bit settings.\nIn this work, we show that the K cache maintains a stable structure that\nevolves gradually with context, while the V cache carries latent semantic\nregularities. Building on these insights, we propose PatternKV, a\npattern-aligned residual quantization scheme. It mines representative pattern\nvectors online, aligns each KV vector to its nearest pattern, and quantizes\nonly the residual.

Although\nexisting approaches such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning have shown\npromise, they lack systematic methodologies for structured rule processing and\nare particularly susceptible to error propagation through sequential reasoning\nchains. To address these limitations, we propose the Dynamic Adjudication\nTemplate (DAT), a novel framework inspired by expert human reasoning processes.\nDAT structures the inference mechanism into three methodical stages:\nqualitative analysis, evidence gathering, and adjudication. During the\nqualitative analysis phase, the model comprehensively evaluates the contextual\nlandscape. The subsequent evidence gathering phase involves the targeted\nextraction of pertinent information based on predefined template elements\n([placeholder]), followed by systematic verification against applicable rules.\nFinally, in the adjudication phase, the model synthesizes these validated\ncomponents to formulate a comprehensive judgment.

These properties have been\nfurther generalized through the notions of semi-involutory and semi-orthogonal\nmatrices. Specifically, we establish nontrivial interconnections between\nsemi-involutory and involutory matrices, as well as between semi-orthogonal and\northogonal matrices.

A similar correspondence holds for\nsemi-orthogonal and orthogonal MDS matrices. We also examine the intersection\nof these classes and show that the number of $3 \\times 3$ MDS matrices that are\nboth semi-involutory and semi-orthogonal coincides with the number of\nsemi-involutory MDS matrices over $\\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$.

However, its reliance on a fixed\ntemperature parameter leads to suboptimal training on diverse preference data,\ncausing overfitting on easy examples and under-learning from informative ones.\nRecent methods have emerged to counter this. While IPO addresses general\noverfitting, its uniform regularization can be overly conservative. The more\ntargeted approach of $\\beta$-DPO suffers from its own limitations: its\nbatch-level adaptation applies a single, compromised temperature to\nmixed-margin pairs, its linear update rule can produce unstable negative\n$\\beta$ values, and its filtering mechanism discards potentially useful\ntraining signals. In this work, we introduce Margin-Adaptive Direct Preference\nOptimization (MADPO), a method that provides a stable, data-preserving, and\ninstance-level solution. MADPO employs a practical two-step approach: it first\ntrains a reward model to estimate preference margins and then uses these\nmargins to apply a continuous, adaptive weight to the DPO loss for each\nindividual training sample. This re-weighting scheme creates an effective\ntarget margin that is amplified for hard pairs and dampened for easy pairs,\nallowing for granular control over the learning signal.

Agentic systems offer a promising\nalternative by decomposing work across specialized modules, yet most remain\ntraining-free or rely on offline training decoupled from the live dynamics of\nmulti-turn interaction. We introduce AgentFlow, a trainable, in-the-flow\nagentic framework that coordinates four modules (planner, executor, verifier,\ngenerator) through an evolving memory and directly optimizes its planner inside\nthe multi-turn loop. To train on-policy in live environments, we propose\nFlow-based Group Refined Policy Optimization (Flow-GRPO), which tackles\nlong-horizon, sparse-reward credit assignment by converting multi-turn\noptimization into a sequence of tractable single-turn policy updates. It\nbroadcasts a single, verifiable trajectory-level outcome to every turn to align\nlocal planner decisions with global success and stabilizes learning with\ngroup-normalized advantages. Across ten benchmarks, AgentFlow with a 7B-scale\nbackbone outperforms top-performing baselines with average accuracy gains of\n14.9% on search, 14.0% on agentic, 14.5% on mathematical, and 4.1%

Here, we review three\nmain classes of PIML frameworks: physics-informed neural networks (PINNs),\nneural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), and neural operators (NOs),\nhighlighting their growing role in biomedical science and engineering. We begin\nwith PINNs, which embed governing equations into deep learning models and have\nbeen successfully applied to biosolid and biofluid mechanics, mechanobiology,\nand medical imaging among other areas. We then review NODEs, which offer\ncontinuous-time modeling, especially suited to dynamic physiological systems,\npharmacokinetics, and cell signaling. Finally, we discuss deep NOs as powerful\ntools for learning mappings between function spaces, enabling efficient\nsimulations across multiscale and spatially heterogeneous biological domains.\nThroughout, we emphasize applications where physical interpretability, data\nscarcity, or system complexity make conventional black-box learning\ninsufficient. We conclude by identifying open challenges and future directions\nfor advancing PIML in biomedical science and engineering, including issues of\nuncertainty quantification, generalization, and integration of PIML and large\nlanguage models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubb3c\ub9ac \uc815\ubcf4 \uae30\ubc18 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5(PIML)\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc0dd\ubb3c \uc758\ud559

This paper proposes a real-time framework with three additional\nsemantic layers to help IoT devices and sensors comprehend data meaning and\nsource. The framework consists of six layers: perception, semantic annotation,\ninteroperability, transportation, semantic reasoning, and application, suitable\nfor dynamic environments. Sensors collect data in the form of voltage, which is\nthen processed by microprocessors or microcontrollers in the semantic\nannotation and preprocessing layer. Metadata is added to the raw data,\nincluding the purpose, ID number, and application. Two semantic algorithms are\nproposed in the semantic interoperability and ontologies layer: the\ninteroperability semantic algorithm for standardizing file types and the\nsynonym identification algorithm for identifying synonyms. In the\ntransportation layer, raw data and metadata are sent to other IoT devices or\ncloud computing platforms using techniques like WiFi, Zigbee networks,\nBluetooth, and mobile communication networks. A semantic reasoning layer is\nproposed to infer new knowledge from the existing data, using fuzzy logic,\nDempster-Shafer theory, and Bayesian networks. A Graphical User Interface (GUI)\nis proposed in the application layer to help users communicate with and monitor\nIoT sensors, devices, and new knowledge inferred. This framework provides a\nrobust solution for managing IoT data, ensuring semantic completeness, and\nenabling real-time knowledge inference. The integration of uncertainty\nreasoning methods and semantic interoperability techniques makes this framework\na valuable tool for advancing IoT applications in general and in agriculture in\nparticular.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 IoT \uc7a5\uce58\uc640 \uc13c\uc11c\uac00 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc774\ud574\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294

However, the provenance of\nprocess adaptations, especially modifications during execu- tion, remains\ninsufficiently addressed. A review of the literature reveals a lack of\nsystematic approaches for capturing provenance information about adaptive\nworkflows/processes. To fill this gap, we propose the AdProv method for\ncollecting, storing, retrieving, and visualizing prove- nance of runtime\nworkflow adaptations. In addition to the definition of the AdProv method in\nterms of steps and concepts like change events, we also present an architecture\nfor a Provenance Holder service that is essential for implementing the method.\nTo ensure semantic consistency and interoperability we define a mapping to the\nontology PROV Ontol- ogy (PROV-O). Additionally, we extend the XES standard\nwith elements for adaptation logging.

However, this tool usage introduces the risk of\nindirect prompt injections, where malicious instructions hidden in tool outputs\ncan manipulate the agent, posing security risks like data leakage. Current\ndefense strategies typically rely on fine-tuning LLM agents on datasets of\nknown attacks. However, the generation of these datasets relies on manually\ncrafted attack patterns, which limits their diversity and leaves agents\nvulnerable to novel prompt injections. To address this limitation, we propose\nAdversarial Reinforcement Learning for Agent Safety (ARLAS), a novel framework\nthat leverages adversarial reinforcement learning (RL) by formulating the\nproblem as a two-player zero-sum game. ARLAS co-trains two LLMs: an attacker\nthat learns to autonomously generate diverse prompt injections and an agent\nthat learns to defend against them while completing its assigned tasks. To\nensure robustness against a wide range of attacks and to prevent cyclic\nlearning, we employ a population-based learning framework that trains the agent\nto defend against all previous attacker checkpoints.

Direct modifications by LLMs typically introduce inconsistencies\nbetween local edits and the overall narrative requirements. To address these\nissues, we propose Dramaturge, a task and feature oriented divide-and-conquer\napproach powered by hierarchical multiple LLM agents. It consists of a Global\nReview stage to grasp the overall storyline and structural issues, a\nScene-level Review stage to pinpoint detailed scene and sentence flaws, and a\nHierarchical Coordinated Revision stage that coordinates and integrates\nstructural and detailed improvements throughout the script. The top-down task\nflow ensures that high-level strategies guide local modifications, maintaining\ncontextual consistency. The review and revision workflow follows a\ncoarse-to-fine iterative process, continuing through multiple rounds until no\nfurther substantive improvements can be made. Comprehensive experiments show\nthat Dramaturge significantly outperforms all baselines in terms of\nscript-level overall quality and scene-level details.

Recently, the Muon\noptimizer has demonstrated promising results by orthogonalizing parameter\nupdates, improving optimization geometry through better conditioning. Despite\nMuon's emergence as a candidate successor to Adam, the potential for jointly\nleveraging their strengths has not been systematically explored. In this work,\nwe bridge this gap by proposing NorMuon (Neuron-wise Normalized Muon), an\noptimizer that synergistically combines orthogonalization with neuron-level\nadaptive learning rates. Our analysis reveals that while Muon effectively\nreduces condition numbers, the resulting updates exhibit highly non-uniform\nneuron norms, causing certain neurons to dominate the optimization process.\nNorMuon addresses this imbalance by maintaining second-order momentum\nstatistics for each neuron and applying row-wise normalization after\northogonalization, ensuring balanced parameter utilization while preserving\nMuon's conditioning benefits. To enable practical deployment at scale, we\ndevelop an efficient distributed implementation under the FSDP2 framework that\nstrategically distributes orthogonalization computations across devices.\nExperiments across multiple model scales demonstrate that NorMuon consistently\noutperforms both Adam and Muon, achieving 21.74% better training efficiency\nthan Adam and 11.31% improvement over Muon on 1.1 B pretraining setting, while\nmaintaining a comparable memory footprint to Muon. Our findings suggest that\northogonalization and adaptive learning rates are complementary rather than\ncompeting approaches, opening new avenues for optimizer design in large-scale\ndeep learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "NorMuon\uc740 Neuron-wise Normalized Muon\uc73c\ub85c, \ud68d\uae30\uc801\uc778 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud6c8\ub828 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uae30\ubc95\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud6c8\ub828 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uae30\ubc95\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uc778\uc2dd\ud558\uace0, Muon \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uae30\ubc95\uc758 \uac15\uc810\uc744 Adam\uacfc \uacb0\ud569\ud560 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub2e4.", "method": "NorMuon\uc740 \uc2e0\uacbd \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc801\uc751 \ud559\uc2b5\ub960\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\uaddc\ud654(orthogonalization)\uc640 \ud611\ub825\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "NorMuon\uc740 1.1B \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c Adam\ubcf4\ub2e4 21.74%, Muon\ubcf4\ub2e4 11.31% \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \ud6c8\ub828 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 Muon\uacfc \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub7c9\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc815\uaddc\ud654\uc640 \uc801\uc751 \ud559\uc2b5\ub960\uc774 \uc11c\ub85c \ubcf4\uc644\uc801\uc778 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub525 \ub7ec\ub2dd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uae30\ubc95 \uc124\uacc4\uc5d0 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc5f4\uc5b4\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uae30\ubc95\uc758 \uc120\ud0dd\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc758 \ud6c8\ub828 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc5d0 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce69\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc Muon \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uae30\ubc95\uc774 \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \uc9c1\uad50\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uae30\ud558\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Submitted to arXiv; based on work\n  from The BIRD Team and Google Cloud. Dataset and code available at\n  https://bird-interact.github.io", "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on\nsingle-turn text-to-SQL tasks, but real-world database applications\npredominantly require multi-turn interactions to handle ambiguous queries,\nexecution errors, and evolving user requirements. Existing multi-turn\nbenchmarks fall short by treating conversation histories as static context or\nlimiting evaluation to read-only operations, failing to reflect\nproduction-grade database assistant challenges. We introduce BIRD-INTERACT, a\nbenchmark that restores this realism through: (1) a comprehensive interaction\nenvironment coupling each database with a hierarchical knowledge base, metadata\nfiles, and a function-driven user simulator, enabling models to solicit\nclarifications, retrieve knowledge, and recover from errors without human\nsupervision; (2) two evaluation settings consisting of a pre-defined\nconversational protocol (c-Interact) and an open-ended agentic setting\n(a-Interact) where models autonomously decide when to query the user simulator\nor explore the environment; (3) a challenging task suite covering the full CRUD\nspectrum for business-intelligence and operational use cases, guarded by\nexecutable test cases. Each task features ambiguous and follow-up sub-tasks\nrequiring dynamic interaction. The suite comprises BIRD-INTERACT-FULL (600\ntasks, up to 11,796 interactions) for comprehensive performance assessment, and\nBIRD-INTERACT-LITE (300 tasks with simplified databases) for detailed\nbehavioral analysis and rapid method development. Our empirical results\nhighlight BIRD-INTERACT's difficulty: GPT-5 completes only 8.67% of tasks in\nc-Interact and 17.00% in a-Interact. Analysis via memory grafting and\nInteraction Test-time Scaling validates the importance of effective interaction\nfor complex, dynamic text-to-SQL tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "BIRD-INTERACT\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc778 SQL \ucffc\ub9ac\ub97c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub294 \ub300\ud654 \uae30\ub85d\uc744 \uc815\uc801 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc73c\ub85c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc77d\uae30 \uc804\uc6a9 \uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc81c\ud55c\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ubca0\uc774\uc2a4 \ubcf4\uc870\uc758 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \ubc18\uc601\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "BIRD-INTERACT\ub294 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0, \uc0ac\uc804 \uc815\uc758\ub41c \ub300\ud654 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uacfc \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc124\uc815\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uba70, \uc804\uccb4 CRUD \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc778 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "BIRD-INTERACT\uc5d0\uc11c GPT-5\ub294 c-Interact\uc5d0\uc11c 8.67%, a-Interact\uc5d0\uc11c 17.00%\uc758 \uc791\uc5c5\ub9cc \uc644\ub8cc\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ubc0f \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uc2dc\ud5d8 \uc2dc\uac04 \ud655\uc7a5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \ubd84\uc11d\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud558\uace0 \ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8-\ud22c-SQL \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \ub2e8\uc77c \ud134 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8-\ud22c-SQL \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ubca0\uc774\uc2a4 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc740 \ubaa8\ud638\ud55c \ucffc\ub9ac, \uc2e4\ud589 \uc624\ub958 \ubc0f \ubcc0\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc8fc\ub85c \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub294 \ub300\ud654 \uae30\ub85d\uc744 \uc815\uc801 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc73c\ub85c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc77d\uae30 \uc804\uc6a9 \uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\ud55c\ud558\uc5ec \uc0dd\uc0b0 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ubca0\uc774\uc2a4 \uc870\uc218\uc758 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \ubc18\uc601\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 BIRD-INTERACT\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ub2e4\uc74c\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud604\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \ud68c\ubcf5\ud558\ub294 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4: (1) \uac01 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ubca0\uc774\uc2a4\uc640 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uae30\ubc18, \uba54\ud0c0\ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud30c\uc77c, \uae30\ub2a5 \uc911\uc2ec \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc778\uac04 \uac10\ub3c5 \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 \uba85\ud655\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4 \uc694\uccad, \uc9c0\uc2dd \uac80\uc0c9 \ubc0f \uc624\ub958 \ubcf5\uad6c\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4;

However, accurate\ngraphon estimation typically requires a large graph, whereas in practice, one\noften only observes a small-sized network. One approach to addressing this\nissue is to adopt a transfer learning framework, which aims to improve\nestimation in a small target graph by leveraging structural information from a\nlarger, related source graph. In this paper, we propose a novel method, namely\nGTRANS, a transfer learning framework that integrates neighborhood smoothing\nand Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport to align and transfer structural\npatterns between graphs. To prevent negative transfer, GTRANS includes an\nadaptive debiasing mechanism that identifies and corrects for target-specific\ndeviations via residual smoothing. We provide theoretical guarantees on the\nstability of the estimated alignment matrix and demonstrate the effectiveness\nof GTRANS in improving the accuracy of target graph estimation through\nextensive synthetic and real data experiments.

Traditional\nmachine-learning approaches primarily focus on isolated node features, often\noverlooking the broader context of interconnected nodes. Graph-based\ntechniques, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have advanced the field\nby leveraging relational information effectively. However, in real-world\nspoofing detection datasets, trading behaviors exhibit dynamic, irregular\npatterns. Existing spoofing detection methods, though effective in some\nscenarios, struggle to capture the complexity of dynamic and diverse, evolving\ninter-node relationships. To address these challenges, we propose a novel\nframework called the Generative Dynamic Graph Model (GDGM), which models\ndynamic trading behaviors and the relationships among nodes to learn\nrepresentations for conspiracy spoofing detection. Specifically, our approach\nincorporates the generative dynamic latent space to capture the temporal\npatterns and evolving market conditions. Raw trading data is first converted\ninto time-stamped sequences. Then we model trading behaviors using the neural\nordinary differential equations and gated recurrent units, to generate the\nrepresentation incorporating temporal dynamics of spoofing patterns.\nFurthermore, pseudo-label generation and heterogeneous aggregation techniques\nare employed to gather relevant information and enhance the detection\nperformance for conspiratorial spoofing behaviors. Experiments conducted on\nspoofing detection datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms\nstate-of-the-art models in detection accuracy. Additionally, our spoofing\ndetection system has been successfully deployed in one of the largest global\ntrading markets, further validating the practical applicability and performance\nof the

While humans naturally interpret symbols through social interaction,\nAI systems often miss the dynamic interpretations that emerge in conversation.\nDrawing on Symbolic Interactionism theory, we conducted two studies to\ninvestigate how humans and AI co-construct symbols and their meanings. Findings\nprovide empirical insights into how humans and conversational AI agents\ncollaboratively shape meanings during interaction. We show how participants\nshift their initial definitions of meaning in response to the symbols and\ninterpretations suggested by the conversational AI agents, especially when\nsocial context is introduced. We also observe how participants project their\npersonal and social values into these interactions, refining meanings over\ntime. These findings reveal that shared understanding does not emerge from mere\nagreement but from the bi-directional exchange and reinterpretation of symbols,\nsuggesting new paradigms for human-AI interaction design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc778\uac04\uacfc AI\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc788\ub294 \ud611\uc5c5\uc740 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ucc98\ub9ac \uc774\uc0c1\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\uba70, \uae30\ud638\uc640 \uadf8 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \uc758\ubbf8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uae4a\uc740 \uc774\ud574\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc778\uac04\uacfc \ub300\ud654\ud615 AI\uac00 \uae30\ud638\uc640 \uc758\ubbf8\ub97c \uacf5\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud588\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc778\uac04\uacfc AI \uac04\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc788\ub294 \ud611\uc5c5\uc744 \uc99d\uc9c4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uae30\ud638\uc640 \uadf8 \uc758\ubbf8\uc758 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uad6c\uc131\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud568.", "method": "\ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc5ec \uc778\uac04\uacfc \ub300\ud654\ud615 AI\uac00 \uae30\ud638\uc640 \uc758\ubbf8\ub97c \uacf5\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\ub294 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud568.", "result": "\uc5f0\uad6c \uacb0\uacfc, \uc778\uac04\uacfc \ub300\ud654\ud615 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uc911 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc758\ubbf8\ub97c \uacf5\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ud615\uc131\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\uc99d\uc801 \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud568.", "conclusion": "\uacf5\uc720\ub41c \uc774\ud574\ub294 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \ub3d9\uc758\uc5d0\uc11c\uac00 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uae30\ud638\uc758 \uc591\ubc29\ud5a5 \uad50\ud658\uacfc \uc7ac\ud574\uc11d\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uc0ac\uc2e4\uc744 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b4\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc778\uac04-AI \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ub514\uc790\uc778\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud568.", "translated_summary": "\uc758\ubbf8 \uc788\ub294 \uc778\uac04-AI \ud611\uc5c5\uc740 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ucc98\ub9ac\ub97c \ub118\uc5b4, \uae30\ud638\uc640 \uadf8 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \uc758\ubbf8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uae4a\uc740 \uc774\ud574\ub97c \uc694\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc778\uac04\uc740 \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7fd\uac8c \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uae30\ud638\ub97c \ud574\uc11d\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ub300\ud654 \uc911\uc5d0 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc5ed\ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \ud574\uc11d\uc744 \uc885\uc885 \ub193\uce69\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uae30\ud638 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ub860 \uc774\ub860\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uc5ec, \uc778\uac04\uacfc AI\uac00 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uae30\ud638\uc640 \uadf8 \uc758\ubbf8\ub97c \uacf5\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc778\uac04\uacfc \ub300\ud654\ud615 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uc911 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ud611\ub825\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc758\ubbf8\ub97c \ud615\uc131\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\uc99d\uc801 \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ucc38\uac00\uc790\ub4e4\uc774 \ub300\ud654\ud615 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\ub294 \uae30\ud638\uc640 \ud574\uc11d\uc5d0 \ubc18\uc751\ud558\uc5ec \ucd08\uae30 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc815\uc758\ub97c \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ubcc0\ud654\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \ud2b9\ud788 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc774 \ub3c4\uc785\ub420 \ub54c \uadf8\ub7f0 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \ub450\ub4dc\ub7ec\uc9d1\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \ucc38\uac00\uc790\ub4e4\uc774 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0 \uac1c\uc778\uc801 \ubc0f \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uac00\uce58\ub97c \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ud22c\uc601\ud558\uba70, \uc2dc\uac04\uc774 \uc9c0\ub0a8\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc758\ubbf8\ub97c \uc815\uc81c\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uad00\ucc30\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uacf5\uc720\ub41c \uc774\ud574\uac00 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \ub3d9\uc758\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uae30\ud638\uc758 \uc591\ubc29\ud5a5 \uad50\ud658\uacfc \uc7ac\ud574\uc11d\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc1d\ud788\uba70, \uc778\uac04-AI \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ub514\uc790\uc778\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Gonzalez", "Ion Stoica"], "title": "vAttention: Verified Sparse Attention", "comment": null, "summary": "State-of-the-art sparse attention methods for reducing decoding latency fall\ninto two main categories: approximate top-$k$ (and its extension, top-$p$) and\nrecently introduced sampling-based estimation. However, these approaches are\nfundamentally limited in their ability to approximate full attention: they fail\nto provide consistent approximations across heads and query vectors and, most\ncritically, lack guarantees on approximation quality, limiting their practical\ndeployment. We observe that top-$k$ and random sampling are complementary:\ntop-$k$ performs well when attention scores are dominated by a few tokens,\nwhereas random sampling provides better estimates when attention scores are\nrelatively uniform. Building on this insight and leveraging the statistical\nguarantees of sampling, we introduce vAttention, the first practical sparse\nattention mechanism with user-specified $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$ guarantees on\napproximation accuracy (thus, verified). These guarantees make vAttention a\ncompelling step toward practical, reliable deployment of sparse attention at\nscale. By unifying top-k and sampling, vAttention outperforms both\nindividually, delivering a superior quality-efficiency trade-off. Our\nexperiments show that vAttention significantly improves the quality of sparse\nattention (e.g., $\\sim$4.5 percentage points for Llama-3.1-8B-Inst and\nDeepseek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B on RULER-HARD), and effectively bridges the gap\nbetween full and sparse attention (e.g., across datasets, it matches full model\nquality with upto 20x sparsity).

This ambiguity makes the\ninverse problem, estimating input parameters from a desired hardness,\nparticularly difficult. In this work, we propose a novel solution using a\nTeacher-Student learning framework. First, a forward model (Teacher) is trained\nto predict final hardness from 13 metallurgical input features. Then, a\nbackward model (Student) is trained to infer plausible input configurations\nfrom a target hardness value. The Student is optimized by leveraging feedback\nfrom the Teacher in an iterative, supervised loop. We evaluate our method on a\npublicly available tempered steel dataset and compare it against baseline\nregression and reinforcement learning models.

Luo"], "title": "Neighborhood-Adaptive Generalized Linear Graph Embedding with Latent Pattern Mining", "comment": null, "summary": "Graph embedding has been widely applied in areas such as network analysis,\nsocial network mining, recommendation systems, and bioinformatics. However,\ncurrent graph construction methods often require the prior definition of\nneighborhood size, limiting the effective revelation of potential structural\ncorrelations in the data. Additionally, graph embedding methods using linear\nprojection heavily rely on a singular pattern mining approach, resulting in\nrelative weaknesses in adapting to different scenarios. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a novel model, Neighborhood-Adaptive Generalized Linear\nGraph Embedding (NGLGE), grounded in latent pattern mining. This model\nintroduces an adaptive graph learning method tailored to the neighborhood,\neffectively revealing intrinsic data correlations.

We evaluate AInstein on\n1,214 ICLR papers stratified by acceptance tier (Oral, Spotlight, Poster),\nusing an LLM-as-a-judge paradigm guided by a structured rubric, complemented by\ntargeted manual checks. Performance is assessed with three metrics: Success\nRate (does the solution address the problem?), Rediscovery (does it align with\nhuman-proposed methods?), and Novelty (does it yield valid, original\napproaches?). Our results reveal that while LLMs can rediscover feasible\nsolutions and occasionally propose creative alternatives, their problem-solving\nability remains fragile and highly sensitive to framing.

We investigate two approaches: direct communication and curriculum\nlearning. In a 4-player Stag Hunt, a one-word \"cheap talk\" channel increases\ncooperation from 0% to 48.3%, demonstrating communication as a robust\ncoordination mechanism. In contrast, we find that curriculum learning is highly\nsensitive to design choices: our pedagogical curriculum through progressively\ncomplex games reduced agent payoffs by 27.4% in an Iterated Public Goods Game\nwith Punishment. Qualitative analysis reveals that curricula emphasizing\ndefection-equilibrium games can induce \"learned pessimism\" in agents.

We propose a hybrid neuro-symbolic\nframework that integrates Answer Set Programming (ASP) with transformer-based\nlearning on the Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) corpus. Domain\nknowledge is formalized as weighted ASP rules and validated using the Clingo\nsolver. These rules are incorporated in two complementary ways: (i) as\nrule-based data augmentation, generating logically consistent synthetic samples\nthat improve label diversity and coverage; and (ii) as a fuzzy-logic\nregularizer, enforcing rule satisfaction in a differentiable form during\nfine-tuning. This design preserves the interpretability of symbolic reasoning\nwhile leveraging the scalability of deep neural architectures. We further tune\nper-class thresholds and report both standard classification metrics and\nlogic-consistency rates. Compared to a strong Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE)\nbaseline, our approach improves micro- and macro-F1 scores and achieves up to\nan 86% reduction in rule violations on the ASRS test set.

While\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise for dimensionality reduction\nthrough feature selection, existing LLM-based approaches frequently lack\nstructured reasoning and transparent justification for their decisions. This\npaper introduces LLM-FS-Agent, a novel multi-agent architecture designed for\ninterpretable and robust feature selection. The system orchestrates a\ndeliberative \"debate\" among multiple LLM agents, each assigned a specific role,\nenabling collective evaluation of feature relevance and generation of detailed\njustifications. We evaluate LLM-FS-Agent in the cybersecurity domain using the\nCIC-DIAD 2024 IoT intrusion detection dataset and compare its performance\nagainst strong baselines, including LLM-Select and traditional methods such as\nPCA. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM-FS-Agent consistently achieves\nsuperior or comparable classification performance while reducing downstream\ntraining time by an average of 46% (statistically significant improvement, p =\n0.028 for XGBoost).

In addition, they often overlook the\nlong-term impact of selected data if the model is trained to convergence,\nprimarily due to the prohibitive cost of full-scale LLM pretraining. In this\npaper, we introduce BLISS (\\textbf{B}ileve\\textbf{L} \\textbf{I}nfluence\n\\textbf{S}coring method for data \\textbf{S}election): a lightweight data\nselection method that operates entirely \\emph{from scratch}, without relying on\nany external pretrained oracle models, while explicitly accounting for the\nlong-term impact of selected data. BLISS leverages a small proxy model as a\nsurrogate for the LLM and employs a score model to estimate the long-term\ninfluence of training samples if the proxy model is trained to convergence. We\nformulate data selection as a bilevel optimization problem, where the\nupper-level objective optimizes the score model to assign importance weights to\ntraining samples, ensuring that minimizing the lower-level objective (i.e.,\ntraining the proxy model over the weighted training loss until convergence)\nleads to best validation performance.

We evaluate\nproprietary models from OpenAI and Google using N-shot prompting on five\ndistinct tasks derived from annotations of cluster bounding boxes, their center\ncoordinates, and outlier coordinates. OpenAI models and Gemini 2.5 Flash,\nespecially when prompted with examples, are viable options for counting\nclusters and, in Flash's case, outliers (90%+ Accuracy). However, the results\nfor localization-related tasks are unsatisfactory: Precision and Recall are\nnear or below 50%, except for Flash in outlier identification (65.01%).\nFurthermore, the impact of chart design on performance appears to be a\nsecondary factor, but it is advisable to avoid scatterplots with wide aspect\nratios (16:9 and 21:9) or those colored randomly.

Unlike static AI models, self-evolving\nagents embed an autonomous evolution cycle that updates models, tools, and\nworkflows in response to environmental dynamics. This paper presents a\ncomprehensive overview of self-evolving agentic AI, highlighting its layered\narchitecture, life cycle, and key techniques, including tool intelligence,\nworkflow optimization, self-reflection, and evolutionary learning. We further\npropose a multi-agent cooperative self-evolving agentic AI framework, where\nmultiple large language models (LLMs) are assigned role-specialized prompts\nunder the coordination of a supervisor agent. Through structured dialogue,\niterative feedback, and systematic validation, the system autonomously executes\nthe entire life cycle without human intervention. A case study on antenna\nevolution in low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs) demonstrates how the\nframework autonomously upgrades fixed antenna optimization into movable antenna\noptimization. Experimental results show that the proposed self-evolving agentic\nAI autonomously improves beam gain and restores degraded performance by up to\n52.02%, consistently surpassing the fixed baseline with little to no human\nintervention and validating its adaptability and robustness for next-generation\nwireless intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc790\uae30 \uc9c4\ud654\ud615

Running LLMs locally\non mobile and edge devices (on-device LLMs) offers the promise of enhanced\nprivacy, reliability, and reduced communication costs. However, realizing this\nvision remains challenging due to substantial memory and compute demands, as\nwell as limited visibility into performance-efficiency trade-offs on\nresource-constrained hardware. We propose lm-Meter, the first lightweight,\nonline latency profiler tailored for on-device LLM inference. lm-Meter captures\nfine-grained, real-time latency at both phase (e.g., embedding, prefill,\ndecode, softmax, sampling) and kernel levels without auxiliary devices. We\nimplement lm-Meter on commercial mobile platforms and demonstrate its high\nprofiling accuracy with minimal system overhead, e.g., only 2.58% throughput\nreduction in prefill and 0.99% in decode under the most constrained Powersave\ngovernor. Leveraging lm-Meter, we conduct comprehensive empirical studies\nrevealing phase- and kernel-level bottlenecks in on-device LLM inference,\nquantifying accuracy-efficiency trade-offs, and identifying systematic\noptimization opportunities. lm-Meter provides unprecedented visibility into the\nruntime behavior of LLMs on constrained platforms, laying the foundation for\ninformed optimization and accelerating the democratization of on-device LLM\nsystems.

After anonymization, GPT-4o\nfilled out structured templates by indicating imaging findings as present\n(\"true\"), absent (\"false\"), or \"uncertain.\" To assess the impact of label\nuncertainty, \"uncertain\" labels of the training and validation sets were\nautomatically reassigned to \"true\" (inclusive) or \"false\" (exclusive).\nLabel-image-pairs were used for multi-label classification using ResNet50.\nLabel extraction accuracy was manually verified on internal (clavicle: n=233,\nelbow: n=745, thumb: n=393) and external test sets (n=300 for each).\nPerformance was assessed using macro-averaged receiver operating characteristic\n(ROC) area under the curve (AUC), precision recall curves, sensitivity,\nspecificity, and accuracy. AUCs were compared with the DeLong test. Results:\nAutomatic extraction was correct in 98.6% (60,618 of 61,488) of labels in the\ntest sets.

Traditional approaches rely on expensive\nhuman-in-the-loop data, which limits scalability. We propose using Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) as policy-agnostic human proxies to generate synthetic\ndata that mimics human decision-making. To evaluate this, we conduct three\nexperiments in a grid-world capture game inspired by Stag Hunt, a game theory\nparadigm that balances risk and reward. In Experiment 1, we compare decisions\nfrom 30 human participants and 2 expert judges with outputs from LLaMA 3.1 and\nMixtral 8x22B models. LLMs, prompted with game-state observations and reward\nstructures, align more closely with experts than participants, demonstrating\nconsistency in applying underlying decision criteria. Experiment 2 modifies\nprompts to induce risk-sensitive strategies (e.g. \"be risk averse\"). LLM\noutputs mirror human participants' variability, shifting between risk-averse\nand risk-seeking behaviours. Finally, Experiment 3 tests LLMs in a dynamic\ngrid-world where the LLM agents generate movement actions. LLMs produce\ntrajectories resembling human participants' paths. While LLMs cannot yet fully\nreplicate human adaptability, their prompt-guided diversity offers a scalable\nfoundation for simulating policy-agnostic teammates.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ube44\uc815\ud615 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud300\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ube44\uc811\uadfc\uc131 \ub610\ub294 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \ub3d9\ub8cc\uc640 \ud611\ub825\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8ec\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc778\uac04 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ubaa8\ubc29\ud55c \ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud611\ub825\uc758 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud655\uc7a5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ube44\uc815\ud615 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud300\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud560 \ub54c, \uc815\ucc45\uc774 \ube44\uc811\uadfc\uc801\uc774\uac70\ub098 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \ub3d9\ub8cc\uc640 \ud611\ub825\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc744 \uc815\ucc45\uc5d0 \uad6c\uc560\ubc1b\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \uc778\uac04 \ub300\ub9ac\uc778\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc778\uac04 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ubaa8\ubc29\ud55c \ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 LLM\uc758 \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \uc778\uac04 \ucc38\uac00\uc790 \ubc0f \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc758 \uacb0\uc815\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.

Recent works have\nproposed techniques to automate the design of MASes, eliminating the need for\nmanual engineering. However, these techniques perform poorly, often achieving\nsimilar or inferior performance to simple baselines. Furthermore, they require\ncomputationally expensive re-discovery of architectures for each new task\ndomain and expensive data annotation on domains without existing labeled\nvalidation sets. A critical insight is that simple Chain of Thought (CoT)\nreasoning often performs competitively with these complex systems, suggesting\nthat the fundamental reasoning unit of MASes, CoT, warrants further\ninvestigation. To this end, we present a new paradigm for automatic MAS design\nthat pivots the focus to optimizing CoT reasoning. We introduce the Agentic\nReasoning Module (ARM), an agentic generalization of CoT where each granular\nreasoning step is executed by a specialized reasoning module. This module is\ndiscovered through a tree search over the code space, starting from a simple\nCoT module and evolved using mutations informed by reflection on execution\ntraces. The resulting ARM acts as a versatile reasoning building block which\ncan be utilized as a direct recursive loop or as a subroutine in a learned\nmeta-orchestrator. Our approach significantly outperforms both manually\ndesigned MASes and state-of-the-art automatic MAS design methods.

As dimensionality increases, the exploration space grows\nexponentially, while the manifold of meaningful skills remains limited.\nTherefore, semantic meaningfulness becomes essential to effectively guide\nexploration in high-dimensional spaces. In this work, we present\nReference-Grounded Skill Discovery (RGSD), a novel algorithm that grounds skill\ndiscovery in a semantically meaningful latent space using reference data. RGSD\nfirst performs contrastive pretraining to embed motions on a unit hypersphere,\nclustering each reference trajectory into a distinct direction. This grounding\nenables skill discovery to simultaneously involve both imitation of reference\nbehaviors and the discovery of semantically related diverse behaviors. On a\nsimulated SMPL humanoid with 359-D observations and 69-D actions, RGSD learns\nstructured skills including walking, running, punching, and side stepping, and\nalso discovers related novel behaviors. In downstream control tasks, RGSD\noutperforms imitation-based skill acquisition baselines.

However, the\ntrajectories of search agents are structurally heterogeneous, where variations\nin the number, placement, and outcomes of search calls lead to fundamentally\ndifferent answer directions and reward distributions. Standard policy gradient\nmethods, which use a single global baseline, suffer from what we identify and\nformalize as cross-stratum bias-an \"apples-to-oranges\" comparison of\nheterogeneous trajectories. This cross-stratum bias distorts credit assignment\nand hinders exploration of complex, multi-step search strategies. To address\nthis, we propose Stratified GRPO, whose central component, Stratified Advantage\nNormalization (SAN), partitions trajectories into homogeneous strata based on\ntheir structural properties and computes advantages locally within each\nstratum. This ensures that trajectories are evaluated only against their true\npeers. Our analysis proves that SAN eliminates cross-stratum bias, yields\nconditionally unbiased unit-variance estimates inside each stratum, and retains\nthe global unbiasedness and unit-variance properties enjoyed by standard\nnormalization, resulting in a more pure and scale-stable learning signal. To\nimprove practical stability under finite-sample regimes, we further linearly\nblend SAN with the global estimator. Extensive experiments on diverse\nsingle-hop and multi-hop question-answering benchmarks demonstrate that\nStratified GRPO consistently and substantially outperforms GRPO by up to 11.3\npoints, achieving higher training rewards, greater training stability, and more\neffective search policies. These results establish stratification as a\nprincipled remedy for structural heterogeneity in RL for LLM search agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uad6c\uc870\uc801

In this context, World Models (WMs) have\nbeen introduced to provide embodied agents with the abilities to anticipate\nfuture environmental states and fill in knowledge gaps, thereby enhancing\nagents' ability to plan and execute actions. However, when dealing with\nembodied agents it is fundamental to ensure that predictions are safe for both\nthe agent and the environment.

Recent reasoning-oriented large language models (LLMs) show promise\nin understanding temporal patterns, but purely zero-shot usage remains\nsuboptimal. We propose FETA, a multi-agent framework for training-free TSC via\nexemplar-based in-context reasoning. FETA decomposes a multivariate series into\nchannel-wise subproblems, retrieves a few structurally similar labeled examples\nfor each channel, and leverages a reasoning LLM to compare the query against\nthese exemplars, producing channel-level labels with self-assessed confidences;\na confidence-weighted aggregator then fuses all channel decisions. This design\neliminates the need for pretraining or fine-tuning, improves efficiency by\npruning irrelevant channels and controlling input length, and enhances\ninterpretability through exemplar grounding and confidence estimation. On nine\nchallenging UEA datasets, FETA achieves strong accuracy under a fully\ntraining-free setting, surpassing multiple trained baselines. These results\ndemonstrate that a multi-agent in-context reasoning framework can transform\nLLMs into competitive, plug-and-play TSC solvers without any parameter\ntraining.

This paper proposes a method to leverage these shortcomings as useful\nfeatures to a construct dynamic, counterfactual benchmark, which can be used to\nboth reveal overfitting and measure true reasoning.

However, a critical gap\nremains: how to reliably query this structured knowledge without sacrificing\nits deterministic properties. This paper introduces the SAT-Graph API, a formal\nquery execution layer centered on canonical actions-atomic, composable, and\nauditable primitives that isolate probabilistic discovery from deterministic\nretrieval.

However, as the landscape of\nreasoning models rapidly expands, a critical question remains: how can we\nsystematically compare and evaluate the test-time scaling capabilities across\ndifferent models? In this paper, we introduce ARISE (Adaptive Resolution-aware\nScaling Evaluation), a novel metric specifically designed to assess the\ntest-time scaling effectiveness of large reasoning models. Unlike existing\nevaluation approaches, ARISE incorporates two key innovations: (1) sample-level\nawareness that effectively penalizes negative scaling behaviors where increased\ncomputation leads to performance degradation, and (2) a dynamic sampling\nmechanism that mitigates the impact of accuracy fluctuations and token count\ninstability on the final assessment. We conduct comprehensive experiments\nevaluating state-of-the-art reasoning models across diverse domains including\nmathematical reasoning, code generation, and agentic tasks. Our results\ndemonstrate that ARISE provides a reliable and fine-grained measurement of\ntest-time scaling capabilities, revealing significant variations in scaling\nefficiency across models.

Pure algorithm evolution,\nas in AlphaEvolve, depends only on the internal knowledge of LLMs and quickly\nplateaus in complex domains, while pure deep research proposes ideas without\nvalidation, resulting in unrealistic or unimplementable solutions. We present\nDeepEvolve, an agent that integrates deep research with algorithm evolution,\nuniting external knowledge retrieval, cross-file code editing, and systematic\ndebugging under a feedback-driven iterative loop. Each iteration not only\nproposes new hypotheses but also refines, implements, and tests them, avoiding\nboth shallow improvements and unproductive over-refinements. Across nine\nbenchmarks in chemistry, mathematics, biology, materials, and patents,\nDeepEvolve consistently improves the initial algorithm, producing executable\nnew algorithms with sustained gains. By bridging the gap between unguided\nevolution and research without grounding, DeepEvolve provides a reliable\nframework for advancing scientific algorithm discovery.

Classical routing algorithms (e.g.,\nshortest-path and constraint-aware search) are efficient but assume structured\ninputs and fixed objectives, limiting adaptability to natural-language queries.\nRecent LLM-based approaches enhance flexibility but struggle with spatial\nreasoning and the joint modeling of route-level and POI-level preferences. To\naddress these limitations, we propose RouteLLM, a hierarchical multi-agent\nframework that grounds natural-language intents into constraint-aware routes.\nIt first parses user queries into structured intents including POIs, paths, and\nconstraints. A manager agent then coordinates specialized sub-agents: a\nconstraint agent that resolves and formally check constraints, a POI agent that\nretrieves and ranks candidate POIs, and a path refinement agent that refines\nroutes via a routing engine with preference-conditioned costs. A final verifier\nagent ensures constraint satisfaction and produces the final route with an\ninterpretable rationale. This design bridges linguistic flexibility and spatial\nstructure, enabling reasoning over route feasibility and user preferences.\nExperiments show that our method reliably grounds textual preferences into\nconstraint-aware routes, improving route quality and preference satisfaction\nover classical methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "RouteLLM\uc740 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uc758\ub3c4\ub97c \uc81c\uc57d \uc778\uc2dd \uacbd\ub85c\ub85c \uc804\ud658\ud558\ub294 \uacc4\uce35 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud558\uace0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \ucda9\uc871\ud558\ub294 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uc5ec\ud589 \uacc4\ud68d \uc81c\uacf5\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud568.", "method": "\uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ucffc\ub9ac\ub97c POI, \uacbd\ub85c \ubc0f \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc758\ub3c4\ub85c \ud30c\uc2f1\ud558\uace0, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc804\ubb38 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc870\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc81c\uc57d \uc778\uc2dd \uacbd\ub85c\ub85c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \uc120\ud638\ub3c4\ub97c \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uc788\uac8c \ubcc0\ud658\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc5b8\uc5b4\uc801 \uc720\uc5f0\uc131\uacfc \uacf5\uac04\uc801 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\uc5ec \uacbd\ub85c \uc801\ud569\uc131 \ubc0f \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc120\ud638\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uacbd\ub85c \ucd94\ucc9c\uc740 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uac00 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \ucda9\uc871\ud558\ub294 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uc5ec\ud589 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uace0\uc804\uc801\uc778 \ub77c\uc6b0\ud305 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998(\uc608: \ucd5c\ub2e8 \uacbd\ub85c \ubc0f \uc81c\uc57d \uc778\uc2dd \ud0d0\uc0c9)\uc740 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc785\ub825\uacfc \uace0\uc815 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uac00\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \ucffc\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc801\uc751\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc\uc758 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc720\uc5f0\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uc9c0\ub9cc \uacf5\uac04 \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \uacbd\ub85c \uc218\uc900\uacfc POI \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc120\ud638\ub3c4\ub97c \uacf5\ub3d9 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\ub294\ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uc758\ub3c4\ub97c \uc81c\uc57d \uc778\uc2dd \uacbd\ub85c\ub85c \uae30\ubc18\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uacc4\uce35 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 RouteLLM\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uba3c\uc800 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc758 \ucffc\ub9ac\ub97c POI, \uacbd\ub85c \ubc0f \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc758\ub3c4\ub85c \ud30c\uc2f1\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7f0 \ub2e4\uc74c \uad00\ub9ac \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0 \uacf5\uc2dd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\uc99d\ud558\ub294 \uc81c\uc57d \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8, \ud6c4\ubcf4 POI\ub97c \uac80\uc0c9\ud558\uace0 \uc21c\uc704\ub97c \ub9e4\uae30\ub294 POI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8, \uc120\ud638 \uc870\uac74 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc815\uc81c\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ub85c \uc815\uc81c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc870\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9 \uac80\uc99d \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc81c\uc57d \ub9cc\uc871\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uace0 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uadfc\uac70\ub85c \ucd5c\uc885 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc124\uacc4\ub294 \uc5b8\uc5b4\uc801 \uc720\uc5f0\uc131\uacfc \uacf5\uac04\uc801 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\uc5ec \uacbd\ub85c \uc801\ud569\uc131 \ubc0f \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc120\ud638\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc6b0\ub9ac \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ud074\ub798\uc2dd\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uacbd\ub85c \uc9c8\uacfc \uc120\ud638\ub3c4 \ub9cc\uc871\ub3c4\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba70 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \uc120\ud638\ub3c4\ub97c \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uc788\uac8c \uc81c\uc57d \uc778\uc2dd \uacbd\ub85c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

We show that optimizing LLMs for competitive success\ncan inadvertently drive misalignment. Using simulated environments across these\nscenarios, we find that, 6.3% increase in sales is accompanied by a 14.0% rise\nin deceptive marketing; in elections, a 4.9% gain in vote share coincides with\n22.3% more disinformation and 12.5% more populist rhetoric; and on social\nmedia, a 7.5% engagement boost comes with 188.6% more disinformation and a\n16.3% increase in promotion of harmful behaviors. We call this phenomenon\nMoloch's Bargain for AI--competitive success achieved at the cost of alignment.\nThese misaligned behaviors emerge even when models are explicitly instructed to\nremain truthful and grounded, revealing the fragility of current alignment\nsafeguards.

Accepted at the Twelfth Annual Conference on\n  Advances in Cognitive Systems (ACS 2025)", "summary": "As algorithmic decision-makers are increasingly applied to high-stakes\ndomains, AI alignment research has evolved from a focus on universal value\nalignment to context-specific approaches that account for decision-maker\nattributes. Prior work on Decision-Maker Alignment (DMA) has explored two\nprimary strategies: (1) classical AI methods integrating case-based reasoning,\nBayesian reasoning, and naturalistic decision-making, and (2) large language\nmodel (LLM)-based methods leveraging prompt engineering. While both approaches\nhave shown promise in limited domains such as medical triage, their\ngeneralizability to novel contexts remains underexplored. In this work, we\nimplement a prior classical AI model and develop an LLM-based algorithmic\ndecision-maker evaluated using a large reasoning model (GPT-5) and a\nnon-reasoning model (GPT-4) with weighted self-consistency under a zero-shot\nprompting framework, as proposed in recent literature. We evaluate both\napproaches on a health insurance decision-making dataset annotated for three\ntarget decision-makers with varying levels of risk tolerance (0.0, 0.5, 1.0).\nIn the experiments reported herein, classical AI and LLM-based models achieved\ncomparable alignment with attribute-based targets, with classical AI exhibiting\nslightly better alignment for a moderate risk profile.

Sequential\nscaling involves lengthening the generation process, while parallel scaling\ninvolves verifying and selecting among multiple candidate outputs. Combining\nthese two strategies has led to the most powerful AI systems, such as Grok 4\nHeavy and GPT-5 Pro. In certain contexts (e.g., solving Sudoku puzzles),\nverifying responses can be substantially easier than generating them. This\nproperty, referred to as \\emph{asymmetric verification}, highlights the strong\npotential of test-time scaling (TTS). In this work, we study both sequential\nand parallel TTS of deep search agents, motivated by the intuition that\nverification in this setting is often much easier than generation. In\nexperiments, we first show that sequential scaling methods, such as budget\nforcing, can be effective initially but soon degrade performance. Leveraging\nasymmetric verification, however, we are able to achieve substantial\nimprovements by allocating only a modest amount of compute to the verifier. We\nconduct experiments with flagship open-source models and extend them to their\n``Heavy'' variants through TTS. These deep research agents achieve gains of up\nto 27 absolute points on benchmarks such as BrowseComp. Remarkably, as an\nopen-source alternative, GLM-4.5 Heavy reaches accuracy of {\\bf 54.0\\%} on\nBrowseComp and {\\bf 66.0\\%} on GAIA, placing it comparable to the best\nproprietary choices such as OpenAI Deep Research.
