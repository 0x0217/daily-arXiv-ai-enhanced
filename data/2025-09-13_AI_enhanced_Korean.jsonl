To address the growing need for effective\ncrop disease management, AI-based disease alerting systems have emerged as\npromising tools by providing early detection and actionable insights for timely\nintervention. However, existing systems often overlook critical aspects such as\ndata privacy, market pricing power, and farmer-friendly usability, leaving\nfarmers vulnerable to privacy breaches and economic exploitation. To bridge\nthese gaps, we propose AgriSentinel, the first Privacy-Enhanced Embedded-LLM\nCrop Disease Alerting System. AgriSentinel incorporates a differential privacy\nmechanism to protect sensitive crop image data while maintaining classification\naccuracy. Its lightweight deep learning-based crop disease classification model\nis optimized for mobile devices, ensuring accessibility and usability for\nfarmers. Additionally, the system includes a fine-tuned, on-device large\nlanguage model (LLM) that leverages a curated knowledge pool to provide farmers\nwith specific, actionable suggestions for managing crop diseases, going beyond\nsimple alerting. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of\nAgriSentinel, demonstrating its ability to safeguard data privacy, maintain\nhigh classification performance, and deliver practical, actionable disease\nmanagement strategies. AgriSentinel offers a robust, farmer-friendly solution\nfor automating crop disease alerting and management, ultimately contributing to\nimproved agricultural decision-making and enhanced crop productivity.", "AI": {"tldr": "AgriSentinel\uc740 \ub18d\uc791\ubb3c \uc9c8\ubcd1 \uad00\ub9ac\uc5d0\uc11c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc\uc640 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud55c AI \uae30\ubc18 \uacbd\uace0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc73c\ub85c, \ub18d\ubbfc\ub4e4\uc5d0\uac8c \uc548\uc804\ud558\uace0 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub18d\uc791\ubb3c \uc9c8\ubcd1\uc740 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uc2dd\ub7c9 \uc548\uc804\uacfc \ub18d\uc5c5 \uc0dd\uc0b0\uc131\uc5d0 \uc704\ud611\uc774 \ub418\uba70, \uc2e4\ud6a8\uc131 \uc788\ub294 \uad00\ub9ac \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \ucee4\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "AgriSentinel\uc740 \ucc28\ub4f1 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \ub18d\uc791\ubb3c \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\uba70, \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c \uae30\uae30\uc5d0 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub41c \uacbd\ub7c9\uc758 \ub525 \ub7ec\ub2dd \uae30\ubc18 \ub18d\uc791\ubb3c \uc9c8\ubcd1 \ubd84\ub958 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ud2b9\ud654\ub41c \uc628\ub514\ubc14\uc774\uc2a4 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "AgriSentinel\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc\ub97c \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\uace0 \ub192\uc740 \ubd84\ub958 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba70 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \ub18d\uc791\ubb3c \uc9c8\ubcd1 \uad00\ub9ac \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "AgriSentinel\uc740 \ub18d\uc791\ubb3c \uc9c8\ubcd1 \uacbd\uace0 \ubc0f \uad00\ub9ac \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud558\uace0 \ub18d\ubbfc \uce5c\ud654\uc801\uc778 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc5ec, \ub18d\uc5c5 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uac1c\uc120\uacfc \ub18d\uc791\ubb3c \uc0dd\uc0b0\uc131 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub18d\uc791\ubb3c \uc9c8\ubcd1\uc740 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uc2dd\ub7c9 \uc548\uc804, \ub18d\uc5c5 \uc0dd\uc0b0\uc131 \ubc0f \uc9c0\uc18d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub18d\uc5c5 \uad00\ud589\uc5d0 \uc911\ub300\ud55c \uc704\ud611\uc744 \uac00\ud558\uba70, \ub18d\ubbfc\uc758 \uc0dd\uacc4\uc640 \uacbd\uc81c\uc801 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc778 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce69\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ub18d\uc791\ubb3c \uc9c8\ubcd1 \uad00\ub9ac\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, AI \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc9c8\ubcd1 \uacbd\uace0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uc870\uae30 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ubc0f \uc2dc\uae30\uc801\uc808\ud55c \uac1c\uc785\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c\ub85c \ubd80\uac01\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc, \uc2dc\uc7a5 \uac00\uaca9 \uacb0\uc815\ub825, \ub18d\ubbfc \uce5c\ud654\uc801\uc778 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc131 \ub4f1\uc758 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uce21\uba74\uc744 \uac04\uacfc\ud558\uc5ec \ub18d\ubbfc\uc774 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc \uce68\ud574\uc640 \uacbd\uc81c\uc801 \ucc29\ucde8\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud55c \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub85c \ub0a8\uc544\uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uc18c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc \ud5a5\uc0c1 \uc784\ubca0\ub514\ub4dc \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \ub18d\uc791\ubb3c \uc9c8\ubcd1 \uacbd\uace0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc778 AgriSentinel\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

During their\noperational phase, IoT devices often run lightweight servers to handle user\ninteractions, such as video streaming or image capture in smart cameras.\nImplementation flaws in transport or application-layer security mechanisms can\nexpose IoT devices to a range of threats, including unauthorized access and\ndata leakage. This paper addresses the challenge of uncovering such\nvulnerabilities by leveraging protocol fuzzing techniques that inject crafted\ntransport and application-layer packets into IoT communications. We present a\nmutation-based fuzzing tool, named IoTFuzzSentry, to identify specific\nnon-trivial vulnerabilities in commercial IoT devices. We further demonstrate\nhow these vulnerabilities can be exploited in real-world scenarios. We\nintegrated our fuzzing tool into a well-known testing tool Cotopaxi and\nevaluated it with commercial-off-the-shelf IoT devices such as IP cameras and\nSmart Plug. Our evaluation revealed vulnerabilities categorized into 4 types\n(IoT Access Credential Leakage, Sneak IoT Live Video Stream, Creep IoT Live\nImage, IoT Command Injection) and we show their exploits using three IoT\ndevices. We have responsibly disclosed all these vulnerabilities to the\nrespective vendors. So far, we have published two CVEs, CVE-2024-41623 and\nCVE-2024-42531, and one is awaiting.

Recent work has explored AI-driven\npentesting agents, but their evaluation relies on oversimplified\ncapture-the-flag (CTF) settings that embed prior knowledge and reduce\ncomplexity, leading to performance estimates far from real-world practice. We\nclose this gap by introducing the first real-world, agent-oriented pentesting\nbenchmark, TermiBench, which shifts the goal from 'flag finding' to achieving\nfull system control. The benchmark spans 510 hosts across 25 services and 30\nCVEs, with realistic environments that require autonomous reconnaissance,\ndiscrimination between benign and exploitable services, and robust exploit\nexecution. Using this benchmark, we find that existing systems can hardly\nobtain system shells under realistic conditions.\n  To address these challenges, we propose TermiAgent, a multi-agent penetration\ntesting framework. TermiAgent mitigates long-context forgetting with a Located\nMemory Activation mechanism and builds a reliable exploit arsenal via\nstructured code understanding rather than naive retrieval. In evaluations, our\nwork outperforms state-of-the-art agents, exhibiting stronger penetration\ntesting capability, reducing execution time and financial cost, and\ndemonstrating practicality even on laptop-scale deployments. Our work delivers\nboth the first open-source benchmark for real-world autonomous pentesting and a\nnovel agent framework that establishes a milestone for AI-driven penetration\ntesting.", "AI":

However, integrating cryptographic protocols with large\nlanguage models (LLMs) presents significant challenges, as the inherent\ncomplexity of these protocols, together with LLMs' massive parameter scale and\nsophisticated architectures, severely limits practical usability. In this work,\nwe propose ENSI, a novel non-interactive secure inference framework for LLMs,\nbased on the principle of co-designing the cryptographic protocols and LLM\narchitecture. ENSI employs an optimized encoding strategy that seamlessly\nintegrates CKKS scheme with a lightweight LLM variant, BitNet, significantly\nreducing the computational complexity of encrypted matrix multiplications. In\nresponse to the prohibitive computational demands of softmax under homomorphic\nencryption (HE), we pioneer the integration of the sigmoid attention mechanism\nwith HE as a seamless, retraining-free alternative. Furthermore, by embedding\nthe Bootstrapping operation within the RMSNorm process, we efficiently refresh\nciphertexts while markedly decreasing the frequency of costly bootstrapping\ninvocations. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that ENSI achieves\napproximately an 8x acceleration in matrix multiplications and a 2.6x speedup\nin softmax inference on CPU compared to state-of-the-art method, with the\nproportion of bootstrapping is reduced to just 1%.", "AI": {"tldr": "ENSI\ub77c\ub294 \ube44\ub300\uba74 \ubcf4\uc548 \ucd94\ub860 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc554\ud638\ud654\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc \ubcf4\ud638\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ubcf4\uc548 \ucd94\ub860\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc740 \ucee4\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ud2b9\ud788 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uc554\ud638\ud654 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc758 \ud1b5\ud569\uc774 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "ENSI\ub294 \uc554\ud638\ud654 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uacfc LLM \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uacf5\ub3d9 \uc124\uacc4\ud558\ub294 \uc6d0\uce59\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uba70, CKKS \uc2a4\ud0b4\uacfc BitNet\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc554\ud638\ud654\ub41c \ud589\ub82c \uacf1\uc148\uc758 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \uc904\uc778\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, ENSI\ub294 \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uae30\ubc95\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ud589\ub82c \uacf1\uc148\uc5d0\uc11c \uc57d 8\ubc30, \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\ub9e5\uc2a4 \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0\uc11c CPU\uc5d0\uc11c 2.6\ubc30\uc758 \uc18d\ub3c4 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubd80\ud2b8\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub798\ud551 \ud638\ucd9c \ube48\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2e8 1%\ub85c \uc904\uc774\uba70, \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc554\ud638\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uac31\uc2e0 \ubc0f \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\ub9e5\uc2a4 \ub300\uccb4\ub85c \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc548\uc804\ud55c \ucd94\ub860\uc740 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacc4\uc0b0\uc744 \ub178\ucd9c\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \uc554\ud638\ud654 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc\ub97c \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\ub294 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uacfc \uc554\ud638\ud654 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc758 \uace0\uc720\ud55c \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131, LLM\uc758 \ubc29\ub300\ud55c \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \uaddc\ubaa8 \ubc0f \uc815\uad50\ud55c \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uac00 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \uc2ec\uac01\ud558\uac8c \uc81c\ud55c\ud558\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc554\ud638\ud654 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uacfc LLM \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uacf5\ub3d9 \uc124\uacc4\ud558\ub294 \uc6d0\uce59\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 LLM\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ube44\ub300\uba74 \ubcf4\uc548 \ucd94\ub860 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 ENSI\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Continuous-time RL (CTRL) has emerged as a promising alternative by\nreplacing discrete-time Bellman recursion with differential value functions\ndefined as viscosity solutions of the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equation.\nWhile CTRL has shown promise, its applications have been largely limited to the\nsingle-agent domain. This limitation stems from two key challenges: (i)\nconventional solution methods for HJB equations suffer from the curse of\ndimensionality (CoD), making them intractable in high-dimensional systems; and\n(ii) even with HJB-based learning approaches, accurately approximating\ncentralized value functions in multi-agent settings remains difficult, which in\nturn destabilizes policy training. In this paper, we propose a CT-MARL\nframework that uses physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to approximate\nHJB-based value functions at scale. To ensure the value is consistent with its\ndifferential structure, we align value learning with value-gradient learning by\nintroducing a Value Gradient Iteration (VGI) module that iteratively refines\nvalue gradients along trajectories. This improves gradient fidelity, in turn\nyielding more accurate values and stronger policy learning.

Applied to the matrix version of the\nLearning from Expert Advice (LEA) problem on the $d$-dimensional spectraplex,\nit is well known that MMWU achieves the minimax-optimal regret bound of\n$O(\\sqrt{T\\log d})$, where $T$ is the time horizon. In this paper, we present\nan improved algorithm achieving the instance-optimal regret bound of\n$O(\\sqrt{T\\cdot S(X||d^{-1}I_d)})$, where $X$ is the comparator in the regret,\n$I_d$ is the identity matrix, and $S(\\cdot||\\cdot)$ denotes the quantum\nrelative entropy. Furthermore, our algorithm has the same computational\ncomplexity as MMWU, indicating that the improvement in the regret bound is\n``free''.\n  Technically, we first develop a general potential-based framework for matrix\nLEA, with MMWU being its special case induced by the standard exponential\npotential. Then, the crux of our analysis is a new ``one-sided'' Jensen's trace\ninequality built on a Laplace transform technique, which allows the application\nof general potential functions beyond exponential to matrix LEA. Our algorithm\nis finally induced by an optimal potential function from the vector LEA\nproblem, based on the imaginary error function.\n  Complementing the above, we provide a memory lower bound for matrix LEA, and\nexplore the applications of our algorithm in quantum learning theory. We show\nthat it outperforms the state of the art for learning quantum states corrupted\nby depolarization noise, random quantum states, and Gibbs states.

Given the considerable intellectual and economic value embedded in\nsuch prompts, prompt theft poses a critical security and privacy concern. In\nthis paper, we investigate prompt-stealing attacks targeting diffusion models.\nWe reveal that numerical optimization-based prompt recovery methods are\nfundamentally limited as they do not account for the initial random noise used\nduring image generation. We identify and exploit a noise-generation\nvulnerability (CWE-339), prevalent in major image-generation frameworks,\noriginating from PyTorch's restriction of seed values to a range of $2^{32}$\nwhen generating the initial random noise on CPUs. Through a large-scale\nempirical analysis conducted on images shared via the popular platform CivitAI,\nwe demonstrate that approximately 95% of these images' seed values can be\neffectively brute-forced in 140 minutes per seed using our seed-recovery tool,\nSeedSnitch. Leveraging the recovered seed, we propose PromptPirate, a genetic\nalgorithm-based optimization method explicitly designed for prompt stealing.\nPromptPirate surpasses state-of-the-art methods, i.e., PromptStealer, P2HP, and\nCLIP-Interrogator, achieving an 8-11% improvement in LPIPS similarity.\nFurthermore, we introduce straightforward and effective countermeasures that\nrender seed stealing, and thus optimization-based prompt stealing, ineffective.\nWe have disclosed our findings responsibly and initiated coordinated mitigation\nefforts with the developers to address this critical vulnerability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8-\uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uc0dd\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ub3c4\uc6a9 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uace0, \uc774\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ubc18\ub300\ucc45\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ub3c4\uc6a9\uc740 \ubcf4\uc548\uacfc \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc\uc758 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ub3c4\uc6a9 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uace0, \ud53c\ub85c\uce58\uc758 \uc2dc\ub4dc \uac12 \uc81c\ud55c\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \ub178\uc774\uc988 \uc0dd\uc131 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c SeedSnitch \ub3c4\uad6c\uc640 PromptPirate \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 CivitAI\uc5d0\uc11c \uacf5\uc720\ub41c \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uc758 \uc57d 95%\uc758 \uc2dc\ub4dc \uac12\uc744 140\ubd84 \ub0b4\uc5d0 \ubcf5\uad6c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ub3c4\uc6a9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ubc18\ub300\ucc45\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uace0, \uac1c\ubc1c\uc790\uc640 \ud611\ub825\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub178\ub825\uc744 \uc2dc\uc791\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\uc640 \uc2dc\ub4dc\ub97c \uc870\uac74\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uc5ec \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud06c\uac8c \ubc1c\uc804\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub0b4\uc7ac\ub41c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc9c0\uc801 \ubc0f \uacbd\uc81c\uc801 \uac00\uce58\ub97c \uace0\ub824\ud560 \ub54c, \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ub3c4\uc6a9\uc740 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ubcf4\uc548 \ubc0f \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc81c\uae30\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ub3c4\uc6a9 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc911 \ucd08\uae30 \ub79c\ub364 \ub178\uc774\uc988\ub97c \uace0\ub824\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc218\uce58 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ubcf5\uad6c \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc774 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\ud55c\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubc1d\ud614\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 PyTorch\uac00 CPU\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd08\uae30 \ub79c\ub364 \ub178\uc774\uc988 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc2dc\ub4dc \uac12\uc744 $2^{32}$ \ubc94\uc704\ub85c \uc81c\ud55c\ud558\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \ub178\uc774\uc988 \uc0dd\uc131 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810(CWE-339)\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc778\uae30 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc CivitAI\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uacf5\uc720\ub41c \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc2e4\uc99d \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc2dc\ub4dc \ubcf5\uad6c \ub3c4\uad6c\uc778 SeedSnitch\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc57d 95%\uc758 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uc758 \uc2dc\ub4dc \uac12\uc744 \uc2dc\ub4dc\ub2f9 140 \ubd84 \ub0b4\uc5d0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac15\uc81c\ub85c \ud574\ub3c5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf5\uad6c\ub41c \uc2dc\ub4dc\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ub3c4\uc6a9\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc720\uc804 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \uae30\ubc18 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 PromptPirate\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

These systems are\nwidely studied across various fields, including neuroscience, ecology,\nepidemiology, and several other subject areas that deal with emergent dynamics.\nA current challenge in the discovery process relates to system identification\nwhen there is no prior knowledge of the underlying physics. We attempt to\naddress this challenge by learning Soft Artificial Life (Soft ALife) models,\nsuch as Agent-based and Cellular Automata (CA) models, from observed data for\nreaction-diffusion systems. In this paper, we present findings on the\napplicability of a conceptual framework, the Data-driven Rulesets for Soft\nArtificial Life (DRSALife) model, to learn Soft ALife rulesets that accurately\nrepresent emergent dynamics in a reaction-diffusion system from observed data.\nThis model has demonstrated promising results for Elementary CA Rule 30, Game\nof Life, and Vicsek Flocking problems in recent work. To our knowledge, this is\none of the few studies that explore machine-based Soft ALife ruleset learning\nand system identification for reaction-diffusion dynamics without any prior\nknowledge of the underlying physics. Moreover, we provide comprehensive\nfindings from experiments investigating the potential effects of using noisy\nand sparse observed datasets on learning emergent dynamics. Additionally, we\nsuccessfully identify the structure and parameters of the underlying partial\ndifferential equations (PDEs) representing these dynamics. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that the learned models are able to predict the emergent dynamics\nwith good accuracy (74%) and exhibit quite robust performance when subjected to\nGaussian noise and temporal sparsity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uae34 \uae09\ubcc0 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559 \ubc1c\uacac\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud2b9\ud788

To overcome these limitations, we\nintroduce a causality-aware deep learning framework that integrates\nMultivariate Granger Causality (MVGC) and PCMCI+ for causal feature selection\nwithin a hybrid neural architecture. Leveraging 43 years (1979-2021) of Arctic\nSea Ice Extent (SIE) data and associated ocean-atmospheric variables at daily\nand monthly resolutions, the proposed method identifies causally influential\npredictors, prioritizes direct causes of SIE dynamics, reduces unnecessary\nfeatures, and enhances computational efficiency. Experimental results show that\nincorporating causal inputs leads to improved prediction accuracy and\ninterpretability across varying lead times. While demonstrated on Arctic SIE\nforecasting, the framework is broadly applicable to other dynamic,\nhigh-dimensional domains, offering a scalable approach that advances both the\ntheoretical foundations and practical performance of causality-informed\npredictive modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc778\uacfc \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ud63c\ub3d9\ud558\uc5ec \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uacfc \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc778\uacfc \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uc778\uc2dd\ud558\ub294 \ub525 \ub7ec\ub2dd \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc778\uacfc\uc801 \ud2b9\uc9d5 \uc120\ud0dd\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uace0 \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc778\uacfc \uad00\uacc4 \uad6c\ubd84 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uacac\uace0\ud558\uace0 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc608\uce21 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud568.", "method": "\uc778\uacfc \uad00\uacc4 \uc778\uc2dd \ub525 \ub7ec\ub2dd \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0, Multivariate Granger Causality (MVGC) \ubc0f PCMCI+\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc778\uacfc\uc801 \ud2b9\uc9d5 \uc120\ud0dd\uc744 \uc218\ud589.", "result": "43\ub144\uac04\uc758 \ubd81\uadf9 \ud574\ube59 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \uad00\ub828 \ubcc0\uc218\ub4e4\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc778\uacfc\uc801 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc608\uce21 \ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0, SIE \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc758 \uc9c1\uc811\uc801 \uc6d0\uc778\uc744 \uc6b0\uc120\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \ud544\uc694 \uc5c6\ub294 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uace0 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b4.", "conclusion": "\ubd81\uadf9 \ud574\ube59 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uba70, \ub2e4\ub978 \ub3d9\uc801 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\ub3c4 \uc801\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud568.", "translated_summary": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc0f \ub525 \ub7ec\ub2dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4 \uae30\ubc18 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec, \uc9c4\uc815\ud55c \uc778\uacfc \uad00\uacc4\uc640 \ud5c8\uc704 \uc5f0\uad00\uc131\uc744 \uad6c\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc2e4\ud328\ud558\uc5ec \uacac\uace0\ud568, \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \ubc0f \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud63c\ud569 \uc2e0\uacbd \uad6c\uc870 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uacfc \ud2b9\uc9d5 \uc120\ud0dd\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub2e4\ubcc0\ub7c9 \uadf8\ub79c\uc800 \uc778\uacfc\uc131(MVGC) \ubc0f PCMCI+\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uc778\uacfc \uc778\uc2dd \ub525 \ub7ec\ub2dd \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. 43\ub144(1979-2021)\uc758 \ubd81\uadf9 \ud574\ube59 \ubc94\uc704(SIE) \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \uad00\ub828\ub41c \ud574\uc591-\ub300\uae30 \ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uc77c\uc77c \ubc0f \uc6d4\uac04 \ud574\uc0c1\ub3c4\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc778\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc601\ud5a5\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uc608\uce21 \ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0, SIE \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc758 \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc778 \uc6d0\uc778\uc744 \uc6b0\uc120\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \ubd88\ud544\uc694\ud55c \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uace0 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc778\uacfc\uc801 \uc785\ub825\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uacfc \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub9ac\ub4dc \ud0c0\uc784\uc5d0\uc11c \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub428\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubd81\uadf9 SIE \uc608\uce21\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc785\uc99d\ub418\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ub2e4\ub978 \ub3d9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0\uc801\uc778 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\ub3c4 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud558\uac8c \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uba70, \uc778\uacfc \uad00\uacc4 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uace0\ub824\ud55c \uc608\uce21 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc758 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uae30\ucd08\uc640 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubaa8\ub450 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

As this pattern progresses, it becomes critical\nto evaluate not only these agents' performance but also the processes through\nwhich they negotiate in dynamic, multi-agent environments. Furthermore,\ndifferent agents exhibit distinct advantages: traditional statistical agents,\nsuch as Bayesian models, may excel under well-specified conditions, whereas\nlarge language models (LLMs) can generalize across contexts. In this work, we\ncompare humans (N = 216), LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro), and Bayesian agents in\na dynamic negotiation setting that enables direct, identical-condition\ncomparisons across populations, capturing both outcomes and behavioral\ndynamics. Bayesian agents extract the highest surplus through aggressive\noptimization, at the cost of frequent trade rejections. Humans and LLMs can\nachieve similar overall surplus, but through distinct behaviors: LLMs favor\nconservative, concessionary trades with few rejections, while humans employ\nmore strategic, risk-taking, and fairness-oriented behaviors.

In contrast, human spatial intelligence, rooted in\nintegrated multisensory perception, spatial memory, and cognitive maps, enables\nflexible, context-aware decision-making in unstructured environments.\nTherefore, bridging this gap is critical for advancing Agentic Spatial\nIntelligence toward better interaction with the physical 3D world. To this end,\nwe first start from scrutinizing the spatial neural models as studied in\ncomputational neuroscience, and accordingly introduce a novel computational\nframework grounded in neuroscience principles. This framework maps core\nbiological functions to six essential computation modules: bio-inspired\nmultimodal sensing, multi-sensory integration, egocentric-allocentric\nconversion, an artificial cognitive map, spatial memory, and spatial reasoning.\nTogether, these modules form a perspective landscape for agentic spatial\nreasoning capability across both virtual and physical environments. On top, we\nconduct a framework-guided analysis of recent methods, evaluating their\nrelevance to each module and identifying critical gaps that hinder the\ndevelopment of more neuroscience-grounded spatial reasoning modules. We further\nexamine emerging benchmarks and datasets and explore potential application\ndomains ranging from virtual to embodied systems, such as robotics. Finally, we\noutline potential research directions, emphasizing the promising roadmap that\ncan generalize spatial reasoning across dynamic or unstructured environments.\nWe hope this work will benefit the research community with a\nneuroscience-grounded perspective and a structured pathway.

Trained\non data from 2000-01-01 to 2025-04-30 (80\\% training, 20\\% testing), the\nlong-only agent achieves 11.87\\% return over around 5 years with 0.92\\% max\ndrawdown, outperforming several currency ETFs. We detail state design (QLSTM\nfeatures and indicators), reward function for trend-following/risk control, and\nmulti-core training. Results show hybrid models yield competitive FX trading\nperformance. Implications include QLSTM's effectiveness for small-profit trades\nwith tight risk and future enhancements.

Recent advancements have extended prediction\ntechniques from individual agents to joint predictions of multiple interacting\nagents, with various strategies to address complex interactions within future\nmotions of agents. However, these methods overlook the evolving nature of these\ninteractions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel progressive\nmulti-scale decoding strategy, termed ProgD, with the help of dynamic\nheterogeneous graph-based scenario modeling. In particular, to explicitly and\ncomprehensively capture the evolving social interactions in future scenarios,\ngiven their inherent uncertainty, we design a progressive modeling of scenarios\nwith dynamic heterogeneous graphs.

MDP states are represented as data bases of facts about\nentities, and Vejde converts each state to a bipartite graph, which is mapped\nto latent states through neural message passing. The factored representation of\nboth states and actions allows Vejde agents to handle problems of varying size\nand structure. We tested Vejde agents on eight problem domains defined in RDDL,\nwith ten problem instances each, where policies were trained using both\nsupervised and reinforcement learning. To test policy generalization, we\nseparate problem instances in two sets, one for training and the other solely\nfor testing. Test results on unseen instances for the Vejde agents were\ncompared to MLP agents trained on each problem instance, as well as the online\nplanning algorithm Prost.

Using this pipeline, we\nintroduce NbQA, a large-scale dataset of standardized task-solution pairs that\nreflect authentic tool-use patterns in practical data science scenarios. To\nfurther enhance multi-step reasoning, we present Jupiter, a framework that\nformulates data analysis as a search problem and applies Monte Carlo Tree\nSearch (MCTS) to generate diverse solution trajectories for value model\nlearning. During inference, Jupiter combines the value model and node visit\ncounts to efficiently collect executable multi-step plans with minimal search\nsteps. Experimental results show that Qwen2.5-7B and 14B-Instruct models on\nNbQA solve 77.82% and 86.38% of tasks on InfiAgent-DABench,\nrespectively-matching or surpassing GPT-4o and advanced agent

Previous methods mainly focus\non creating dense reward signals to guide learning, either through traditional\nreinforcement learning techniques like inverse reinforcement learning or by\nusing Process Reward Models for step-by-step feedback. In this paper, we\nidentify a fundamental problem in the learning dynamics of LLMs: the magnitude\nof policy gradients is inherently coupled with the entropy, which leads to\ninefficient small updates for confident correct actions and potentially\ndestabilizes large updates for uncertain ones. To resolve this, we propose\nEntropy-Modulated Policy Gradients (EMPG), a framework that re-calibrates the\nlearning signal based on step-wise uncertainty and the final task outcome. EMPG\namplifies updates for confident correct actions, penalizes confident errors,\nand attenuates updates from uncertain steps to stabilize exploration. We\nfurther introduce a bonus term for future clarity that encourages agents to\nfind more predictable solution paths. Through comprehensive experiments on\nthree challenging agent tasks, WebShop, ALFWorld, and Deep Search, we\ndemonstrate that EMPG achieves substantial performance gains and significantly\noutperforms strong policy gradient baselines.

However, existing benchmarks remain limited in task\ncoverage, domain diversity, difficulty modeling, and evaluation rigor, failing\nto capture the full capabilities of such agents in realistic settings. We\npresent TAM Bench, a diverse, realistic, and structured benchmark for\nevaluating LLM-based agents on end-to-end ML tasks. TAM Bench features three\nkey innovations: (1) A browser automation and LLM-based task acquisition system\nthat automatically collects and structures ML challenges from platforms such as\nKaggle, AIcrowd, and Biendata, spanning multiple task types and data modalities\n(e.g., tabular, text, image, graph, audio); (2) A leaderboard-driven difficulty\nmodeling mechanism that estimates task complexity using participant counts and\nscore dispersion, enabling scalable and objective task calibration; (3) A\nmulti-dimensional evaluation framework incorporating performance, format\ncompliance, constraint adherence, and task generalization. Based on 150 curated\nAutoML tasks, we construct three benchmark subsets of different sizes -- Lite,\nMedium, and Full -- designed for varying evaluation scenarios. The Lite\nversion, with 18 tasks and balanced coverage across modalities and difficulty\nlevels, serves as a practical testbed for daily benchmarking and comparative\nstudies.", "AI": {"tldr": "TAM Bench\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub85c, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c ML \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc73c\ub85c end-to-end \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\uac00 \uac00\ub2a5\ud574\uc84c\uc73c\ub098, \uae30\uc874 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub294 \uc774\ub4e4\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "TAM Bench\ub294 \ube0c\ub77c\uc6b0\uc800 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654 \ubc0f LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc218\uc9d1 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c, \ucc38\uac00\uc790 \uc218 \ubc0f \uc810\uc218 \ubd84\uc0b0\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \ub09c\uc774\ub3c4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \uae30\uad6c, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud3c9\uac00 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \ud3c9\uac00 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uac16\ucd94\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "150\uac1c\uc758 \uc120\ubcc4\ub41c AutoML \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud06c\uae30\uc758 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ud558\uc704 \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Lite \ubc84\uc804\uc740 18\uac1c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uc5ec \ub9e4\uc77c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud0b9 \ubc0f \ube44\uad50 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0 \uc801\ud569\ud55c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ubca0\ub4dc \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\uc11d, \ud2b9\uc131 \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\ub9c1, \ubaa8\ub378 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubc0f \uacbd\uc7c1 \ud574\uacb0\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uc5d4\ub4dc \ud22c \uc5d4\ub4dc \uba38\uc2e0\ub7ec\ub2dd(ML) \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub97c \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubc94\uc6a9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ucd9c\ud604\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5 \ubc94\uc704, \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131, \ub09c\uc774\ub3c4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \ubc0f \ud3c9\uac00 \ucca0\uc800\uc131\uc5d0 \ud55c\uacc4\uac00 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc804\uccb4 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5d4\ub4dc \ud22c \uc5d4\ub4dc ML \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub2e4\uc591\ud558\uace0 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc774\uba70 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc778 TAM Bench\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, traditional RL\napproaches struggle to balance efficient exploration and semantic understanding\ndue to limited cognitive capabilities embedded in the small policies for the\nagents, leading often to human drivers when dealing with semantic exploration.\nIn this paper, we address this challenge by presenting a novel Deep\nReinforcement Learning (DRL) architecture that is specifically designed for\nresource efficient semantic exploration. A key methodological contribution is\nthe integration of a Vision-Language Model (VLM) common-sense through a layered\nreward function. The VLM query is modeled as a dedicated action, allowing the\nagent to strategically query the VLM only when deemed necessary for gaining\nexternal guidance, thereby conserving resources. This mechanism is combined\nwith a curriculum learning strategy designed to guide learning at different\nlevels of complexity to ensure robust and stable learning. Our experimental\nevaluation results convincingly demonstrate that our agent achieves\nsignificantly enhanced object discovery rates and develops a learned capability\nto effectively navigate towards semantically rich regions.

This work proposes\ndeveloping molecule representations using the concept of Functional Groups (FG)\nin chemistry. We introduce the Functional Group Representation (FGR) framework,\na novel approach to encoding molecules based on their fundamental chemical\nsubstructures. Our method integrates two types of functional groups: those\ncurated from established chemical knowledge (FG), and those mined from a large\nmolecular corpus using sequential pattern mining (MFG). The resulting FGR\nframework encodes molecules into a lower-dimensional latent space by leveraging\npre-training on a large dataset of unlabeled molecules. Furthermore, the\nproposed framework allows the inclusion of 2D structure-based descriptors of\nmolecules. We demonstrate that the FGR framework achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on a diverse range of 33 benchmark datasets spanning physical\nchemistry, biophysics, quantum mechanics, biological activity, and\npharmacokinetics while enabling chemical interpretability. Crucially, the\nmodel's representations are intrinsically aligned with established chemical\nprinciples, allowing chemists to directly link predicted properties to specific\nfunctional groups and facilitating novel insights into structure-property\nrelationships.

Existing methods\ntypically depend on vector retrieval and hierarchical storage, yet they are\nprone to noise accumulation, uncontrolled memory expansion, and limited\ngeneralization across domains. To address these challenges, we present SEDM,\nSelf-Evolving Distributed Memory, a verifiable and adaptive framework that\ntransforms memory from a passive repository into an active, self-optimizing\ncomponent. SEDM integrates verifiable write admission based on reproducible\nreplay, a self-scheduling memory controller that dynamically ranks and\nconsolidates entries according to empirical utility, and cross-domain knowledge\ndiffusion that abstracts reusable insights to support transfer across\nheterogeneous tasks. Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SEDM\nimproves reasoning accuracy while reducing token overhead compared with strong\nmemory baselines, and further enables knowledge distilled from fact\nverification to enhance multi-hop reasoning. The results highlight SEDM as a\nscalable and sustainable memory mechanism for open-ended multi-agent\ncollaboration.

Real-world value often stems from the length of task an agent can\ncomplete. We start this work by observing the simple but counterintuitive fact\nthat marginal gains in single-step accuracy can compound into exponential\nimprovements in the length of a task a model can successfully complete. Then,\nwe argue that failures of LLMs when simple tasks are made longer arise from\nmistakes in execution, rather than an inability to reason. We propose isolating\nexecution capability, by explicitly providing the knowledge and plan needed to\nsolve a long-horizon task. We find that larger models can correctly execute\nsignificantly more turns even when small models have 100\\% single-turn\naccuracy. We observe that the per-step accuracy of models degrades as the\nnumber of steps increases. This is not just due to long-context limitations --\ncuriously, we observe a self-conditioning effect -- models become more likely\nto make mistakes when the context contains their errors from prior turns.\nSelf-conditioning does not reduce by just scaling the model size. In contrast,\nrecent thinking models do not self-condition, and can also execute much longer\ntasks in a single turn. We conclude by benchmarking frontier thinking models on\nthe length of task they can execute in a single turn. Overall, by focusing on\nthe ability to execute, we hope to reconcile debates on how LLMs can solve\ncomplex reasoning problems yet fail at simple tasks when made longer, and\nhighlight the massive benefits of scaling model size and sequential test-time\ncompute for long-horizon tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud06c\uae30\ub97c \uacc4\uc18d \ub298\ub9ac\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc218\uc775 \uac10\uc18c\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc9c0\ub294\uac00?
