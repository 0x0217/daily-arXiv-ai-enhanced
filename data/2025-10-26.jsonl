Prompt injection attacks\ncan cause LLMs to leak sensitive data, spread misinformation, and exhibit\nharmful behaviors. To defend against these attacks, we propose CourtGuard, a\nlocally-runnable, multiagent prompt injection classifier. In it, prompts are\nevaluated in a court-like multiagent LLM system, where a \"defense attorney\"\nmodel argues the prompt is benign, a \"prosecution attorney\" model argues the\nprompt is a prompt injection, and a \"judge\" model gives the final\nclassification. CourtGuard has a lower false positive rate than the Direct\nDetector, an LLM as-a-judge. However, CourtGuard is generally a worse prompt\ninjection detector. Nevertheless, this lower false positive rate highlights the\nimportance of considering both adversarial and benign scenarios for the\nclassification of a prompt. Additionally, the relative performance of\nCourtGuard in comparison to other prompt injection classifiers advances the use\nof multiagent systems as a defense against prompt injection attacks.

The introduction of the MCP has further enhanced AI\nintegration by standardizing communication between AI systems and external data\nsources. Despite these advancements, there is still no standardized method for\nseamlessly integrating LLM applications and blockchain. To address this\nconcern, we propose \"MCC: Model Context Contracts\" a novel framework that\nenables LLMs to interact directly with blockchain smart contracts through\nMCP-like protocol. This integration allows AI agents to invoke blockchain smart\ncontracts, facilitating more dynamic and context-aware interactions between\nusers and blockchain networks. Essentially, it empowers users to interact with\nblockchain systems and perform transactions using queries in natural language.\nWithin this proposed architecture, blockchain smart contracts can function as\nintelligent agents capable of recognizing user input in natural language and\nexecuting the corresponding transactions. To ensure that the LLM accurately\ninterprets natural language inputs and maps them to the appropriate MCP\nfunctions, the LLM was fine-tuned using a custom dataset comprising user inputs\npaired with their corresponding MCP server functions.

Specifically, AdaDoS models\nthe problem as a competitive game between an attacker, whose goal is to\nobstruct network traffic without being detected, and a detector, which aims to\nidentify malicious traffic. AdaDoS can solve this game by dynamically adjusting\nits attack strategy based on feedback from the SDN and the detector.\nAdditionally, recognising that attackers typically have less information than\ndefenders, AdaDoS formulates the DoS-like attack as a partially observed Markov\ndecision process (POMDP), with the attacker having access only to delay\ninformation between attacker and victim nodes. We address this challenge with a\nnovel reciprocal learning module, where the student agent, with limited\nobservations, enhances its performance by learning from the teacher agent, who\nhas full observational capabilities in the SDN environment. AdaDoS represents\nthe first application of RL to develop DoS-like attack sequences, capable of\nadaptively evading both machine learning-based and rule-based DoS-like attack\ndetectors."}

To go beyond language, we introduce a new paradigm, thought\ncommunication, which enables agents to interact directly mind-to-mind, akin to\ntelepathy. To uncover these latent thoughts in a principled way, we formalize\nthe process as a general latent variable model, where agent states are\ngenerated by an unknown function of underlying thoughts. We prove that, in a\nnonparametric setting without auxiliary information, both shared and private\nlatent thoughts between any pair of agents can be identified. Moreover, the\nglobal structure of thought sharing, including which agents share which\nthoughts and how these relationships are structured, can also be recovered with\ntheoretical guarantees. Guided by the established theory, we develop a\nframework that extracts latent thoughts from all agents prior to communication\nand assigns each agent the relevant thoughts, along with their sharing\npatterns. This paradigm naturally extends beyond LLMs to all modalities, as\nmost observational data arise from hidden generative processes. Experiments on\nboth synthetic and real-world benchmarks validate the theory and demonstrate\nthe collaborative advantages of thought communication. We hope this work\nilluminates the potential of leveraging the hidden world, as many challenges\nremain unsolvable through surface-level observation alone, regardless of\ncompute or data scale."}
