The increased reliance on specialized subcontractors enables\ncompanies to scale labor dynamically based on project demands. This adaptable\nworkforce model presents challenges in managing hierarchical integration and\ncoordinating inter-site collaboration. Our design introduces a subsystem\nintegrated into the Odoo ERP framework, employing a modular architecture to\nstreamline labor management, task tracking, and approval workflows. The system\nadopts a three-pronged approach to ensure synchronized data exchange between\ngeneral contractors and subcontractors, while maintaining both security and\noperational independence. The system features hybrid access control,\nthird-party integration for cross-domain communication, and role-based mapping\nalgorithm across sites. The system supports varying degrees of customization\nthrough a unified and consolidated attribute mapping center. This center\nleverages a tree-like index structure and Lagrange interpolation method to\nenhance the efficiency of role mapping. Demonstrations highlight practical\napplication in outsourcing, integration, and scalability scenarios, confirming\nthe system's robustness under high user volumes and in offline conditions.\nExperimental results further show improvements in database performance and\nworkflow adaptability to support a scalable, enterprise-level solution that\naligns with the evolving demands of smart construction management.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uac74\uc124 4.0 \uc2dc\ub300\uc5d0 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uc544\uc6c3\uc18c\uc2f1 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub178\ub3d9

However, extending this\nfunctionality to trusted applications (TA) -- executing within Trusted\nExecution Environments (TEEs) -- introduces unique challenges such as secure\nstate preservation, integrity verification, replay and rollback prevention, and\nmitigation of unauthorized cloning of TAs. We present TALOS, a lightweight\nframework for verifiable state management and trustworthy application\nmigration. While our implementation is prototyped and evaluated using Intel SGX\nwith the Gramine LibOS and RISC-V Keystone (evidencing the framework's\nportability across diverse TEEs), its design is agnostic to the underlying TEE\narchitecture. Such agility is a necessity in today's network service mesh\n(collaborative computing across the continuum) where application workloads must\nbe managed across domain boundaries in a harmonized fashion. TALOS is built\naround the principle of minimizing trust assumptions: TAs are treated as\nuntrusted until explicitly verified, and the migration process does not rely on\na trusted third party.

While this visibility\nenhances network optimization and enables advanced services, it also introduces\na potential security risk -- a malicious or compromised Y1 consumer could\nmisuse analytics to facilitate targeted interference. In this work, we\ndemonstrate how an adversary can exploit the Y1 interface to launch selective\njamming attacks by passively monitoring downlink metrics. We propose and\nevaluate two Y1-aided jamming strategies: a clustering-based jammer leveraging\nDBSCAN for traffic profiling and a threshold-based jammer. These are compared\nagainst two baselines strategies -- always-on jammer and random jammer -- on an\nover-the-air LTE/5G O-RAN testbed. Experimental results show that in\nunconstrained jamming budget scenarios, the threshold-based jammer can closely\nreplicate the disruption caused by always-on jamming while reducing\ntransmission time by 27\\%. Under constrained jamming budgets, the\nclustering-based jammer proves most effective, causing up to an 18.1\\% bitrate\ndrop while remaining active only 25\\% of the time. These findings reveal a\ncritical trade-off between jamming stealthiness and efficiency, and illustrate\nhow exposure of RAN analytics via the Y1 interface can enable highly targeted,\nlow-overhead attacks, raising important security considerations for both\ncivilian and mission-critical O-RAN deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 O-RAN\uc758 Y1

This study aims to critically evaluate the\nethical viability and reliability of LLMs when applied to the ethically\nsensitive, high-risk decision-making contexts inherent in CPM. A mixed-methods\nresearch design was employed, involving the quantitative performance testing of\ntwo leading LLMs against twelve real-world ethical scenarios using a novel\nEthical Decision Support Assessment Checklist (EDSAC), and qualitative analysis\nof semi-structured interviews with 12 industry experts to capture professional\nperceptions. The findings reveal that while LLMs demonstrate adequate\nperformance in structured domains such as legal compliance, they exhibit\nsignificant deficiencies in handling contextual nuance, ensuring\naccountability, and providing transparent reasoning. Stakeholders expressed\nconsiderable reservations regarding the autonomous use of AI for ethical\njudgments, strongly advocating for robust human-in-the-loop oversight. To our\nknowledge, this is one of the first studies to empirically test the ethical\nreasoning of LLMs within the construction domain.

Training agents that can reliably self-improve over such\nsequences at inference-time is a natural target for reinforcement learning\n(RL), yet the naive approach assumes a fixed maximum iteration depth, which can\nbe both costly and arbitrary. We present Exploratory Iteration (ExIt), a family\nof autocurriculum RL methods that directly exploits the recurrent structure of\nself-improvement tasks to train LLMs to perform multi-step self-improvement at\ninference-time while only training on the most informative single-step\niterations.

Most existing optimizers tune\nconfigurations while holding the graph fixed, leaving structural failure modes\nunaddressed. We introduce Maestro, a framework-agnostic holistic optimizer for\nLLM agents that jointly searches over graphs and configurations to maximize\nagent quality, subject to explicit rollout/token budgets. Beyond numeric\nmetrics, Maestro leverages reflective textual feedback from traces to\nprioritize edits, improving sample efficiency and targeting specific failure\nmodes. On the IFBench and HotpotQA benchmarks, Maestro consistently surpasses\nleading prompt optimizers--MIPROv2, GEPA, and GEPA+Merge--by an average of 12%,\n4.9%, and 4.86%, respectively; even when restricted to prompt-only\noptimization, it still leads by 9.65%, 2.37%, and 2.41%.

With auxiliary modules and planning cores, LLM-enabled\nagents can autonomously plan and take actions to deal with diverse environment\nsemantics and user intentions. However, the limited resources of individual\nnetwork devices significantly hinder the efficient operation of LLM-enabled\nagents with complex tool calls, highlighting the urgent need for efficient\nmulti-level device collaborations. To this end, the framework and method of the\nLLM-enabled multi-agent system with dual-loop terminal-edge collaborations are\nproposed in 6G networks. Firstly, the outer loop consists of the iterative\ncollaborations between the global agent and multiple sub-agents deployed on\nedge servers and terminals, where the planning capability is enhanced through\ntask decomposition and parallel sub-task distribution. Secondly, the inner loop\nutilizes sub-agents with dedicated roles to circularly reason, execute, and\nreplan the sub-task, and the parallel tool calling generation with offloading\nstrategies is incorporated to improve efficiency. The improved task planning\ncapability and task execution efficiency are validated through the conducted\ncase study in 6G-supported urban safety governance. Finally, the open\nchallenges and future directions are thoroughly analyzed in 6G networks,\naccelerating the advent of the 6G era.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 6G

November 6-8, 2025,\n  Arlington, VA, USA", "summary": "Modeling & Simulation (M&S) approaches such as agent-based models hold\nsignificant potential to support decision-making activities in health, with\nrecent examples including the adoption of vaccines, and a vast literature on\nhealthy eating behaviors and physical activity behaviors. These models are\npotentially usable by different stakeholder groups, as they support\npolicy-makers to estimate the consequences of potential interventions and they\ncan guide individuals in making healthy choices in complex environments.\nHowever, this potential may not be fully realized because of the models'\ncomplexity, which makes them inaccessible to the stakeholders who could benefit\nthe most. While Large Language Models (LLMs) can translate simulation outputs\nand the design of models into text, current approaches typically rely on\none-size-fits-all summaries that fail to reflect the varied informational needs\nand stylistic preferences of clinicians, policymakers, patients, caregivers,\nand health advocates. This limitation stems from a fundamental gap: we lack a\nsystematic understanding of what these stakeholders need from explanations and\nhow to tailor them accordingly. To address this gap, we present a step-by-step\nframework to identify stakeholder needs and guide LLMs in generating tailored\nexplanations of health simulations. Our procedure uses a mixed-methods design\nby first eliciting the explanation needs and stylistic preferences of diverse\nhealth stakeholders, then optimizing the ability of LLMs to generate

While recent progress has\nfocused on scaling Language and Agent models, the development of sophisticated,\nexplicit World Models remains a key bottleneck, particularly for complex,\nlong-horizon multi-agent tasks. In domains such as robotic soccer, agents\ntrained via standard reinforcement learning in high-fidelity but\nstructurally-flat simulators often fail due to intractable exploration spaces\nand sparse rewards. This position paper argues that the next frontier in\ndeveloping capable agents lies in creating environments that possess an\nexplicit, hierarchical World Model. We contend that this is best achieved\nthrough hierarchical scaffolding, where complex goals are decomposed into\nstructured, manageable subgoals. Drawing evidence from a systematic review of\n2024 research in multi-agent soccer, we identify a clear and decisive trend\ntowards integrating symbolic and hierarchical methods with multi-agent\nreinforcement learning (MARL). These approaches implicitly or explicitly\nconstruct a task-based world model to guide agent learning. We then propose a\nparadigm shift: leveraging Large Language Models to dynamically generate this\nhierarchical scaffold, effectively using language to structure the World Model\non the fly. This language-driven world model provides an intrinsic curriculum,\ndense and meaningful learning signals, and a framework for compositional\nlearning, enabling Agent Models to acquire sophisticated, strategic behaviors\nwith far greater sample efficiency. By building environments with explicit,\nlanguage-configurable task layers, we can bridge the gap between low-level\nreactive behaviors and high-level strategic team play, creating a powerful and\ngeneralizable framework for training the next generation of intelligent agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubaa8\ub378, \uc6d4\ub4dc \ubaa8\ub378\uc758

It is motivated by and closely aligned with how humans make decisions\nin a CRL context using an arbitration control of multiple RL agents in parallel\nas observed in the prefrontal cortex. We integrated two key ideas into our\nmodel: (1) an ensemble of RLs (i.e., DQN variants) explicitly trained to have\ndiverse value functions and (2) an arbitration control that prioritizes agents\nwith higher reliability (i.e., less error) in recent trials. We propose a\nframework for CRL, an Arbitration Control for an Ensemble of Diversified DQN\nvariants (ACED-DQN).

However, standard\nMLP-based PINNs often fail to converge when dealing with complex initial-value\nproblems, leading to solutions that violate causality and suffer from a\nspectral bias towards low-frequency components. To address these issues, we\nintroduce NeuSA (Neuro-Spectral Architectures), a novel class of PINNs inspired\nby classical spectral methods, designed to solve linear and nonlinear PDEs with\nvariable coefficients. NeuSA learns a projection of the underlying PDE onto a\nspectral basis, leading to a finite-dimensional representation of the dynamics\nwhich is then integrated with an adapted Neural ODE (NODE). This allows us to\novercome spectral bias, by leveraging the high-frequency components enabled by\nthe spectral representation; to enforce causality, by inheriting the causal\nstructure of NODEs, and to start training near the target solution, by means of\nan initialization scheme based on classical methods. We validate NeuSA on\ncanonical benchmarks for linear and nonlinear wave equations, demonstrating\nstrong performance as compared to other architectures, with faster convergence,\nimproved temporal consistency and superior predictive accuracy.

They cannot ask,\n\"what if we take this action? how will it affect the final outcome\" and\nforecast its potential consequences before acting. This critical gap limits\ntheir utility in dynamic, high-stakes scenarios like strategic planning, risk\nassessment, and real-time decision making. To bridge this gap, we propose\nWiA-LLM, a new paradigm that equips LLMs with proactive thinking capabilities.\nOur approach integrates What-If Analysis (WIA), a systematic approach for\nevaluating hypothetical scenarios by changing input variables. By leveraging\nenvironmental feedback via reinforcement learning, WiA-LLM moves beyond\nreactive thinking. It dynamically simulates the outcomes of each potential\naction, enabling the model to anticipate future states rather than merely react\nto the present conditions. We validate WiA-LLM in Honor of Kings (HoK), a\ncomplex multiplayer game environment characterized by rapid state changes and\nintricate interactions. The game's real-time state changes require precise\nmulti-step consequence prediction, making it an ideal testbed for our approach.\nExperimental results demonstrate WiA-LLM achieves a remarkable 74.2% accuracy\nin forecasting game-state changes (up to two times gain over baselines). The\nmodel shows particularly significant gains in high-difficulty scenarios where\naccurate foresight is critical. To our knowledge, this is the first work to\nformally explore and integrate what-if analysis capabilities within LLMs.\nWiA-LLM represents a fundamental advance toward proactive reasoning in LLMs,\nproviding a scalable framework for robust decision-making in dynamic\nenvironments with broad implications for strategic applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "WiA-LLM\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uc0ac\uc804\uc801 \uc0ac\uace0 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubd80\uc5ec\ud558\uc5ec \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \uacc4\ud68d \ubc0f \ub9ac\uc2a4\ud06c \ud3c9\uac00\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \uace0\uc704\ud5d8 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c \uac00\uc124\uc801\uc778 \ubbf8\ub798\ub97c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uc5ec \uadf8 \uc720\uc6a9\uc131\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c\ub2e4.", "method": "WiA-LLM\uc740 \uc785\ub825 \ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \ubcc0\uacbd\ud558\uc5ec \uac00\uc124 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc778 What-If \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "WiA-LLM\uc740 \uac8c\uc784 \uc0c1\ud0dc \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \ub370 74.2%\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "WiA-LLM\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc0ac\uc804\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 advances\uc774\uba70, \ub3d9\uc801 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ubc18\uc751\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub098\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uac00\uc124\uc801\uc778 \ubbf8\ub798\ub97c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub4e4\uc740 \"\uc6b0\ub9ac\uac00 \uc774 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ucde8\ud558\uba74 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ub420\uae4c?

To address this challenge, we aim\nto develop an AI system that provides useful feedback to promote prosocial\nbehaviour - actions that benefit others, even when not directly aligned with\none's own goals. We introduce ProToM, a Theory of Mind-informed facilitator\nthat promotes prosocial actions in multi-agent systems by providing targeted,\ncontext-sensitive feedback to individual agents. ProToM first infers agents'\ngoals using Bayesian inverse planning, then selects feedback to communicate by\nmaximising expected utility, conditioned on the inferred goal distribution.

In this work, we present ModaliSurv, a multimodal deep survival\nmodel utilising DeepHit with a projection layer and inter-modality\ncross-attention, which integrates heterogeneous patient data, including\nclinical, MRI, RNA-seq and whole-slide pathology features. The model is\ndesigned to capture complementary prognostic signals across modalities and\nestimate individualised time-to-biochemical recurrence in prostate cancer and\ntime-to-cancer recurrence in bladder cancer. Our approach was evaluated in the\ncontext of the CHIMERA Grand Challenge, across two of the three provided tasks.\nFor Task 1 (prostate cancer bio-chemical recurrence prediction), the proposed\nframework achieved a concordance index (C-index) of 0.843 on 5-folds\ncross-validation and 0.818 on CHIMERA development set, demonstrating robust\ndiscriminatory ability. For Task 3 (bladder cancer recurrence prediction), the\nmodel obtained a C-index of 0.662 on 5-folds cross-validation and 0.457 on\ndevelopment set, highlighting its adaptability and potential for clinical\ntranslation.

However,\nthere remains a gap between complex RL policies and domain experts, due to the\nlimited comprehensibility of XRL results and isolated coverage of current XRL\napproaches that leave users uncertain about which tools to employ. To address\nthese challenges, we introduce TalkToAgent, a multi-agent Large Language Models\n(LLM) framework that delivers interactive, natural language explanations for RL\npolicies. The architecture with five specialized LLM agents (Coordinator,\nExplainer, Coder, Evaluator, and Debugger) enables TalkToAgent to automatically\nmap user queries to relevant XRL tools and clarify an agent's actions in terms\nof either key state variables, expected outcomes, or counterfactual\nexplanations. Moreover, our approach extends previous counterfactual\nexplanations by deriving alternative scenarios from qualitative behavioral\ndescriptions, or even new rule-based policies.

While\nprior work has examined language model decision-making in isolated or\nshort-term game-theoretic contexts, these studies often neglect long-horizon\ninteractions, human-model collaboration, and the evolution of behavioral\npatterns over time. In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of language\nmodel behavior in the iterated prisoner's dilemma (IPD), a classical framework\nfor studying cooperation and conflict. We pit model-based agents against a\nsuite of 240 well-established classical strategies in an Axelrod-style\ntournament and find that language models achieve performance on par with, and\nin some cases exceeding, the best-known classical strategies. Behavioral\nanalysis reveals that language models exhibit key properties associated with\nstrong cooperative strategies - niceness, provocability, and generosity while\nalso demonstrating rapid adaptability to changes in opponent strategy mid-game.\nIn controlled \"strategy switch\" experiments, language models detect and respond\nto shifts within only a few rounds, rivaling or surpassing human adaptability.\nThese results provide the first systematic characterization of long-term\ncooperative behaviors in language model agents, offering a foundation for\nfuture research into their

These systems are increasingly being deployed in domains such as\ncustomer service and healthcare care, where they can automate repetitive tasks,\nreduce operational costs, and provide constant support around the clock. In\nthis paper, we present a general methodology for cloning a conversational voice\nAI agent from a corpus of call recordings. Although the case study described in\nthis paper uses telesales data to illustrate the approach, the underlying\nprocess generalizes to any domain where call transcripts are available. Our\nsystem listens to customers over the telephone, responds with a synthetic\nvoice, and follows a structured playbook learned from top performing human\nagents. We describe the domain selection, knowledge extraction, and prompt\nengineering used to construct the agent, integrating automatic speech\nrecognition, a large language model based dialogue manager, and text to speech\nsynthesis into a streaming inference pipeline. The cloned agent is evaluated\nagainst human agents on a rubric of 22 criteria covering introduction, product\ncommunication, sales drive, objection handling, and closing. Blind tests show\nthat the AI agent approaches human performance in routine aspects of the call\nwhile underperforming in persuasion and objection handling. We analyze these\nshortcomings and refine the prompt accordingly. The paper concludes with design\nlessons and avenues for future research, including large scale simulation and\nautomated evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud1b5\ud654

While prior work has\nadvanced agent selection and result aggregation, efficient linguistic\ninteractions for deep collaboration among expert agents remain a critical\nbottleneck. OSC addresses this gap as a pivotal intermediate layer between\nselection and aggregation, introducing Collaborator Knowledge Models (CKM) to\nenable each agent to dynamically perceive its collaborators' cognitive states.\nThrough real-time cognitive gap analysis, agents adaptively adjust\ncommunication behaviors, including content focus, detail level, and expression\nstyle, using learned strategies.

World models have found broad\napplications across various domains, including embodied AI, autonomous driving,\nentertainment, etc. A more realistic simulation with accurate physics will\neffectively narrow the sim-to-real gap and allow us to gather rich information\nabout the real world conveniently. While traditional manual modeling has\nenabled the creation of virtual 3D scenes, modern approaches have leveraged\nadvanced machine learning algorithms for 3D world generation, with most recent\nadvances focusing on generative methods that can create virtual worlds based on\nuser instructions. This work explores such a research direction by proposing\nLatticeWorld, a simple yet effective 3D world generation framework that\nstreamlines the industrial production pipeline of 3D environments. LatticeWorld\nleverages lightweight LLMs (LLaMA-2-7B) alongside the industry-grade rendering\nengine (e.g., Unreal Engine 5) to generate a dynamic environment. Our proposed\nframework accepts textual descriptions and visual instructions as multimodal\ninputs and creates large-scale 3D interactive worlds with dynamic agents,\nfeaturing competitive multi-agent interaction, high-fidelity physics\nsimulation, and real-time rendering. We conduct comprehensive experiments to\nevaluate LatticeWorld, showing that it achieves superior accuracy in scene\nlayout generation and visual fidelity. Moreover, LatticeWorld achieves over a\n$90\\times$ increase in industrial production efficiency while maintaining high\ncreative quality compared with traditional manual production methods.

We demonstrate our method\nby computing an FCG on 500K patents, which we release for further research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uae30\ub2a5\uc801 \uac1c\ub150 \uadf8\ub798\ud504(FCG)\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uacfc \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ucc3d\uc758\uc801\uc778 \uc601\uac10\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 MUSE \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud601\uc2e0\uac00\ub4e4\uc740 \uae30\uc874 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc774\ub098 \ucd08\uae30 \uc544\uc774\ub514\uc5b4\uc5d0 \uc778\uc9c0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uace0\ucc29\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub300\uc548\uc744 \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uae30\ub2a5\uc801 \uc694\uc18c\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc5f0\uacb0\ub41c \ud45c\ud604\uc778 \uae30\ub2a5\uc801 \uac1c\ub150 \uadf8\ub798\ud504(FCG)\ub97c \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "500K \ud2b9\ud5c8\uc5d0\uc11c FCG\ub97c \uacc4\uc0b0\ud558\uc5ec \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 FCG\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 MUSE \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc2e4\ud589\ud558\uc5ec \uc8fc\uc5b4\uc9c4 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucc3d\uc758\uc801\uc778 \uc601\uac10\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c FCG\ub97c \ucd94\uac00 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uacf5\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud601\uc2e0\uac00\ub4e4\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uae30\uc874 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc774\ub098 \ucd08\uae30 \uc544\uc774\ub514\uc5b4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc778\uc9c0\uc801 \uace0\ucc29\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub300\uc548\uc744 \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc7a5\uc560\uac00 \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654, \ubb38\uc81c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131 \ubc0f \uc720\ucd94\uc801 \uc601\uac10\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \uae30\ub2a5 \uc694\uc18c\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc5f0\uacb0\ub41c \ud45c\ud604\uc778 \uae30\ub2a5\uc801 \uac1c\ub150 \uadf8\ub798\ud504(FCG)\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc778 \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 FCG\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\uc804 \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub610\ud55c FCG\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc8fc\uc5b4\uc9c4 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucc3d\uc758\uc801 \uc601\uac10\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 MUSE\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 50\ub9cc \uac1c\uc758 \ud2b9\ud5c8\uc5d0\uc11c FCG\ub97c \uacc4\uc0b0\ud558\uc5ec \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ucd94\uac00 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uacf5\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}
