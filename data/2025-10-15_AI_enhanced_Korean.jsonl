However, this manual, point-in-time approach has struggled to keep\npace with cloud-native development. FedRAMP 20x, a 2025 pilot program,\nreimagines the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF): replacing traditional NIST\n800-53 controls with Key Security Indicators (KSIs), using automated,\nmachine-readable evidence, and emphasizing continuous reporting and\nauthorization.\n  This case study presents a practitioner-led field report from an industry\nparticipant who led multiple FedRAMP 20x pilot submissions and engaged directly\nwith the FedRAMP PMO, 3PAOs, and community working groups. It explores how\nKSIs, continuous evidence pipelines, and DevSecOps integration can streamline\nauthorization and improve cyber risk management.

For dataset\nsanitization (Mode 1), evaluation is conducted on CORD-19, a COVID-19 Open\nResearch Dataset of coronavirus-related scholarly articles. We define three\nsanitization tiers--L1 (compact, high-precision), L2 (human-curated biosafety\nterms), and L3 (comprehensive union)--with removal rates rising from 0.46% to\n70.40%, illustrating the safety-utility trade-off. For preference alignment\n(Mode 2), DPO with LoRA adapters internalizes refusals and safe completions,\nreducing end-to-end attack success rate (ASR) from 59.7% to 3.0%. At inference\n(Mode 3), run-time guardrails across L1-L3 show the expected security-usability\ntrade-off: L2 achieves the best balance (F1 = 0.720, precision = 0.900, recall\n= 0.600, FPR =0.067), while L3 offers stronger jailbreak resistance at the cost\nof higher false positives. Under continuous automated red-teaming (Mode 4), no\nsuccessful jailbreaks are observed under the tested protocol.

Diffusion models have recently\nemerged as powerful priors for solving such problems. However, existing methods\neither rely on projection-based techniques that enforce measurement consistency\nthrough heuristic updates, or they approximate the likelihood $p(\\boldsymbol{y}\n\\mid \\boldsymbol{x})$, often resulting in artifacts and instability under\ncomplex or high-noise conditions. To address these limitations, we propose a\nnovel framework called \\emph{coupled data and measurement space diffusion\nposterior sampling} (C-DPS), which eliminates the need for constraint tuning or\nlikelihood approximation. C-DPS introduces a forward stochastic process in the\nmeasurement space $\\{\\boldsymbol{y}_t\\}$, evolving in parallel with the\ndata-space diffusion $\\{\\boldsymbol{x}_t\\}$, which enables the derivation of a\nclosed-form posterior $p(\\boldsymbol{x}_{t-1} \\mid \\boldsymbol{x}_t,\n\\boldsymbol{y}_{t-1})$.

Case studies in software agent design", "comment": null, "summary": "LLM-powered agents are both a promising new technology and a source of\ncomplexity, where choices about models, tools, and prompting can affect their\nusefulness. While numerous benchmarks measure agent accuracy across domains,\nthey mostly assume full automation, failing to represent the collaborative\nnature of real-world use cases. In this paper, we make two major steps towards\nthe rigorous assessment of human-agent interactions. First, we propose PULSE, a\nframework for more efficient human-centric evaluation of agent designs, which\ncomprises collecting user feedback, training an ML model to predict user\nsatisfaction, and computing results by combining human satisfaction ratings\nwith model-generated pseudo-labels. Second, we deploy the framework on a\nlarge-scale web platform built around the open-source software agent OpenHands,\ncollecting in-the-wild usage data across over 15k users. We conduct case\nstudies around how three agent design decisions -- choice of LLM backbone,\nplanning strategy, and memory mechanisms -- impact developer satisfaction\nrates, yielding practical insights for software agent design. We also show how\nour framework can lead to more robust conclusions about agent design, reducing\nconfidence intervals by 40\\% compared to a standard A/B test. Finally, we find\nsubstantial discrepancies between in-the-wild results and benchmark performance\n(e.g., the anti-correlation between results comparing claude-sonnet-4 and\ngpt-5), underscoring the limitations of benchmark-driven evaluation. Our\nfindings provide guidance for evaluations of LLM agents with humans and\nidentify opportunities for better agent designs.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758

Integrating System Dynamics (SD) and Agent Based Modelling (ABM)\nallows the proposed multi level framework to capture uncertainties in work\neffort, team size, and project duration, which influence technological\nprogress. While AB SD hybrid models are established in other fields, their use\nin R and D remains limited. The model combines system level feedback structures\ngoverning work phases, rework cycles, and duration with decentralised agents\nsuch as team members, tasks, and controllers, whose interactions generate\nemergent project dynamics. A base case scenario analysed early stage innovation\nprojects with 15 parallel tasks over 156 weeks. A comparative sequential\nscenario showed an 88 percent reduction in rework duration. A second scenario\nassessed mixed parallel sequential task structures with varying team sizes. In\nparallel configurations, increasing team size reduced project duration and\nimproved task completion, with optimal results for teams of four to five\nmembers. These findings align with empirical evidence showing that moderate\nteam expansion enhances coordination efficiency without excessive communication\noverhead. However, larger teams may decrease performance due to communication\ncomplexity and management delays. Overall, the model outputs and framework\nalign with expert understanding, supporting their validity as quantitative\ntools for analysing resource allocation, scheduling efficiency, and technology\nmaturity progression.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 R&D \ud504\ub85c\uc81d\ud2b8\uc758 \uae30\uc220 \uc131\uc219\ub3c4 \uc9c4\ud654\ub97c \uc608\uce21\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \uc0ac\ub840\ub85c \uc11d\uc720 \ubc0f \uac00\uc2a4 \uc0b0\uc5c5\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "R&D \ud504\ub85c\uc81d\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc220 \uc131\uc219\ub3c4\ub97c \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\uc5b4 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uace0 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc815\uad50\ud55c \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\uc548\uc744 \ubaa8\uc0c9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ub2e4\uc774\ub0b4\ubbf9\uc2a4(SD)\uc640 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1(ABM)\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \ucea1\ucc98\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc218\uc900 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uae30\ubcf8 \uc0ac\ub840\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 15\uac1c\uc758 \ubcd1\ub82c \uc791\uc5c5\uc774 156\uc8fc \ub3d9\uc548 \uc9c4\ud589\ub41c \ucd08\uae30 \ub2e8\uacc4 \ud601\uc2e0 \ud504\ub85c\uc81d\ud2b8\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc5ec, \uc7ac\uc791\uc5c5 \uae30\uac04\uc774 88% \uac10\uc18c\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubaa8\ub378 \ucd9c\ub825\uacfc \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc758 \uc774\ud574\uc640 \uc77c\uce58\ud558\uba70, \uc790\uc6d0 \ud560\ub2f9, \uc77c\uc815 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \ubc0f \uae30\uc220 \uc131\uc219\ub3c4 \uc9c4\uc804\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc815\ub7c9\uc801 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub85c\uc11c\uc758 \uc720\ud6a8\uc131\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 R&D \ud504\ub85c\uc81d\ud2b8\uc758 \uae30\uc220 \uc131\uc219\ub3c4\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \uc11d\uc720 \ubc0f \uac00\uc2a4 \uc0b0\uc5c5\uc744 \uc0ac\ub840\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ub2e4\uc774\ub0b4\ubbf9\uc2a4(SD)\uc640 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1(ABM)\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec, \uc791\uc5c5 \ub178\ub825, \ud300 \ud06c\uae30 \ubc0f \ud504\ub85c\uc81d\ud2b8 \uae30\uac04\uc758 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \ucea1\ucc98\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2e4\uc218\uc900 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 \uc81c\uc548\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, this evolution has often\nresulted in increasingly complex security practices that alienate users,\nleading to poor compliance and heightened vulnerability. Consequently,\nindividuals remain exposed to attackers through weak or improperly managed\npasswords, underscoring the urgent need for a comprehensive defense mechanism\nthat effectively addresses password-related risks and threats. In this paper,\nwe propose a multifaceted solution designed to revolutionize password security\nby integrating diverse attributes such as the Password Dissection Mechanism,\nDynamic Password Policy Mechanism, human behavioral patterns, device\ncharacteristics, network parameters, geographical context, and other relevant\nfactors. By leveraging learning-based models, our framework constructs detailed\nuser profiles capable of recognizing individuals and preventing nearly all\nforms of unauthorized access or device possession. The proposed framework\nenhances the usability-security paradigm by offering stronger protection than\nexisting standards while simultaneously engaging users in the policy-setting\nprocess through a novel, adaptive approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ube44\ubc00\ubc88\ud638 \ubcf4\uc548\uc740 \ud604\ub300 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ub2a5\ub825 \uc99d\uac00\uc5d0 \ub300\uc751\ud558\uc5ec \ubc1c\uc804\ud574\uc57c \ud588\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uac00 \uc18c\uc678\ub418\uace0 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc900\uc218\uc728\uc774 \ub0ae\uc544\uc9c0\uba74\uc11c \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ube44\ubc00\ubc88\ud638 \uad00\ub828 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ube44\ubc00\ubc88\ud638 \ud574\uccb4 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998, \ub3d9\uc801 \ube44\ubc00\ubc88\ud638 \uc815\ucc45 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998 \ub4f1 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \ub2e4\uba74\uc801 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ube44\ubc00\ubc88\ud638 \ubcf4\uc548\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc774 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc5d0\uac8c \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud558\uace0 \uc900\uc218\uc728\uc744 \ub0ae\ucdb0 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud574\uc9c4 \uc810.", "method": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc694\uc778\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ube44\ubc00\ubc88\ud638 \ubcf4\uc548\uc744 \ud601\uc2e0\ud558\ub294 \ubcf5\ud569\uc801 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158 \uc81c\uc548.", "result": "\ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac1c\uc778\uc744 \uc778\uc2dd\ud558\uace0 \ubb34\ub2e8 \uc811\uadfc\uc744 \ucc28\ub2e8\ud558\ub294 \uc0c1\uc138\ud55c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ud504\ub85c\ud544 \uad6c\ucd95.", "conclusion": "\uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ucc38\uc5ec\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \uc815\ucc45 \uc124\uc815 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ubcf4\ud638\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ube44\ubc00\ubc88\ud638 \ubcf4\uc548\uc740 \ud604\ub300 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ub2a5\ub825 \uc99d\uac00\uc5d0 \ub300\uc751\ud558\uc5ec \ubc1c\uc804\ud574\uc57c \ud588\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774 \uc9c4\ud654\ub294 \uc885\uc885 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\ub4e4\uc744 \uc18c\uc678\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ubcf4\uc548 \uad00\ud589\uc73c\ub85c \uadc0\uacb0\ub418\uc5b4 \uacb0\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc800\uc870\ud55c \uc900\uc218\uc728\uacfc \uc99d\uac00\ub41c \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uac1c\uc778\uc740 \uc57d\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ubd80\uc801\uc808\ud558\uac8c \uad00\ub9ac\ub41c \ube44\ubc00\ubc88\ud638\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uacf5\uaca9\uc790\uc5d0\uac8c \ub178\ucd9c\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ube44\ubc00\ubc88\ud638 \uad00\ub828 \uc704\ud5d8 \ubc0f \uc704\ud611\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uae34\uae09\ud55c \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ube44\ubc00\ubc88\ud638 \ud574\uccb4 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998, \ub3d9\uc801 \ube44\ubc00\ubc88\ud638 \uc815\ucc45 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998, \uc778\uac04 \ud589\ub3d9 \ud328\ud134, \uc7a5\uce58 \ud2b9\uc131, \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218, \uc9c0\ub9ac\uc801 \ub9e5\ub77d \ubc0f \uae30\ud0c0 \uad00\ub828 \uc694\uc778\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ube44\ubc00\ubc88\ud638 \ubcf4\uc548\uc744 \ud601\uc2e0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \ub2e4\uba74\uc801 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ubcf8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uac1c\uc778\uc744 \uc778\uc2dd\ud558\uace0 \uac70\uc758 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ud615\ud0dc\uc758 \ubb34\ub2e8 \uc811\uadfc \ub610\ub294 \uc7a5\uce58 \uc18c\uc720\ub97c \ubc29\uc9c0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc0c1\uc138\ud55c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ud504\ub85c\ud544\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \ud45c\uc900\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \uac15\ud55c \ubcf4\ud638\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc801\uc751\uc801 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc815\ucc45 \uc124\uc815 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\ub97c \ucc38\uc5ec\uc2dc\ud0b4\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc131\uacfc \ubcf4\uc548 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4."}}

Recently,\na paradigm shift has emerged with the rise of large language models (LLMs),\nintroducing autonomous systems, referred to as agents, that accelerate\ndiscovery across varying levels of autonomy. These language agents provide a\nflexible and versatile framework that orchestrates interactions with human\nscientists, natural language, computer language and code, and physics. This\npaper presents our view and vision of LLM-based scientific agents and their\ngrowing role in transforming the scientific discovery lifecycle, from\nhypothesis discovery, experimental design and execution, to result analysis and\nrefinement.

However, existing state-of-the-art algorithms do not fully\nexploit inter-agent coupling information to develop MARL algorithms. In this\npaper, we propose a systematic approach to leverage structures in the\ninter-agent couplings for efficient model-free reinforcement learning. We model\nthe cooperative MARL problem via a Bayesian network and characterize the subset\nof agents, termed as the value dependency set, whose information is required by\neach agent to estimate its local action value function exactly. Moreover, we\npropose a partially decentralized training decentralized execution (P-DTDE)\nparadigm based on the value dependency set. We theoretically establish that the\ntotal variance of our P-DTDE policy gradient estimator is less than the\ncentralized training decentralized execution (CTDE) policy gradient estimator.\nWe derive a multi-agent policy gradient theorem based on the P-DTDE scheme and\ndevelop a scalable actor-critic algorithm. We demonstrate the efficiency and\nscalability of the proposed algorithm on multi-warehouse resource allocation\nand multi-zone temperature control examples. For dense value dependency sets,\nwe propose an approximation scheme based on truncation of the Bayesian network\nand empirically show that it achieves a faster convergence than the exact value\ndependence set for applications with a large number of agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(MARL)\uc5d0\uc11c

Existing countermeasures, from post-hoc\nclassifiers to software-based signing, fail to address the fundamental\nchallenge of establishing an unbreakable link to reality at the moment of\ncapture. This whitepaper introduces Signing Right Away (SRA), a comprehensive\nsecurity architecture that guarantees the provenance of digital media from\n\"silicon to silicon to signed file.\" SRA leverages a four-pillar security\nmodel-Confidentiality, Integrity, Authentication, and Replay Protection, akin\nto the MIPI Camera Security Framework (CSF), but also extends its scope beyond\nthe internal data bus to the creation of a cryptographically sealed,\nC2PA-compliant final asset. By securing the entire imaging pipeline within a\nTrusted Execution Environment (TEE), SRA ensures that every captured image and\nvideo carries an immutable, verifiable proof of origin. This provides a\nfoundational solution for industries reliant on trustworthy visual information,\nincluding journalism, legal evidence, and insurance.

To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose ProtoMM, a novel SSL framework that introduces a shared\nprototype dictionary to anchor heterogeneous modalities in a common embedding\nspace.

We introduce SwarmSys, a closed-loop framework for distributed\nmulti-agent reasoning inspired by swarm intelligence. Coordination in SwarmSys\nemerges through iterative interactions among three specialized roles,\nExplorers, Workers, and Validators, that continuously cycle through\nexploration, exploitation, and validation. To enable scalable and adaptive\ncollaboration, we integrate adaptive agent and event profiles, embedding-based\nprobabilistic matching, and a pheromone-inspired reinforcement mechanism,\nsupporting dynamic task allocation and self-organizing convergence without\nglobal supervision. Across symbolic reasoning, research synthesis, and\nscientific programming tasks, SwarmSys consistently outperforms baselines,\nimproving both accuracy and reasoning stability.

This report introduces the Knowledge Graph-Enhanced Multi-Agent\nInfrastructure(KG-MAS), as resolution in addressing such limitations. KG-MAS\nleverages a centralized Knowledge Graph (KG) as a dynamic, shared world model,\nproviding a common semantic foundation for a Multi-Agent System(MAS).\nAutonomous agents, representing both physical and digital components, query\nthis KG for decision-making and update it with real-time state information. The\ninfrastructure features a model-driven architecture which facilitates the\nautomatic generation of agents from semantic descriptions, thereby simplifying\nsystem extension and maintenance.

The\nproposed approach is verified using IQ samples collected from ten different\nADALM-PLUTO Software Defined Radios (SDRs), with seven devices considered\ngenuine, two as rogue, and one used for validation to determine the threshold.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc704\uc870 \uc7a5\uce58 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ubc0f \uc9c4\uc9dc \uc7a5\uce58 \uc2dd\ubcc4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubb34\uc120 \uc8fc\ud30c\uc218 \uc9c0\ubb38 \uc778\uc2dd(RFF)\uc740 \uc2e0\ud638 \uc0dd\uc131 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0 \uad00\ub828\ub41c \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\uc758 \uace0\uc720\ud55c \uacb0\ud568\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc7a5\uce58\ub97c \uc778\uc99d\ud558\ub294 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc73c\ub85c \ubc1c\uc804\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\ub9e5\uc2a4 \ud655\ub960 \uc784\uacc4\uac12\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc545\uc758\uc801\uc778 \uc7a5\uce58\ub97c \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \uc9c4\uc9dc \uc7a5\uce58\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 CNN \uae30\ubc18 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

Empirical evidence consistently shows that even powerful\nTransformers often fail to outperform much simpler models, e.g., linear models,\non TSF tasks; however, a rigorous theoretical understanding of this phenomenon\nremains limited. In this paper, we provide a theoretical analysis of\nTransformers' limitations for TSF through the lens of In-Context Learning (ICL)\ntheory. Specifically, under AR($p$) data, we establish that: (1) Linear\nSelf-Attention (LSA) models $\\textit{cannot}$ achieve lower expected MSE than\nclassical linear models for in-context forecasting; (2) as the context length\napproaches to infinity, LSA asymptotically recovers the optimal linear\npredictor; and (3) under Chain-of-Thought (CoT) style inference, predictions\ncollapse to the mean exponentially. We empirically validate these findings\nthrough carefully designed experiments. Our theory not only sheds light on\nseveral previously underexplored phenomena but also offers practical insights\nfor designing more effective forecasting architectures.

While recent advances in LLMs offer promise for automating\nincident management tasks, existing LLM-based solutions lack specialized\nsupport for several key challenges, including managing TSG quality issues,\ninterpreting complex control flow, handling data-intensive queries, and\nexploiting execution parallelism. We first conducted an empirical study on 92\nreal-world TSGs, and, guided by our findings, we present StepFly, a novel\nend-to-end agentic framework for troubleshooting guide automation. Our approach\nfeatures a three-stage workflow: the first stage provides a comprehensive guide\ntogether with a tool, TSG Mentor, to assist SREs in improving TSG quality; the\nsecond stage performs offline preprocessing using LLMs to extract structured\nexecution DAGs from unstructured TSGs and to create dedicated Query Preparation\nPlugins (QPPs); and the third stage executes online using a DAG-guided\nscheduler-executor framework with a memory system to guarantee correct workflow\nand support parallel execution of independent steps. Our empirical evaluation\non a collection of real-world TSGs and incidents demonstrates that StepFly\nachieves a ~94% success rate on GPT-4.1, outperforming baselines with less time\nand token consumption. Furthermore, it achieves a remarkable execution time\nreduction of 32.9% to 70.4% for parallelizable TSGs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 IT \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc0ac\uac74 \uad00\ub9ac\ub97c \uc704\ud574 StepFly\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 IT \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc0ac\uac74 \uad00\ub9ac\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0 \uac00\uc774\ub4dc(TSG)\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc218\uc791\uc5c5 \uc2e4\ud589\uc740 \ub290\ub9ac\uace0 \uc624\ub958\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uae30 \uc27d\ub2e4.", "method": "StepFly\ub294 3\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub418\uba70, \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 TSG \ud488\uc9c8 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 TSG Mentor \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0, \ub450 \ubc88\uc9f8 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 LLM\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ube44\uad6c\uc870\uc801 TSG\uc5d0\uc11c \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc2e4\ud589 DAG\ub97c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\uace0 \ucffc\ub9ac \uc900\ube44 \ud50c\ub7ec\uadf8\uc778\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uc138 \ubc88\uc9f8 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 DAG \uae30\ubc18 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\ub7ec-\uc2e4\ud589\uae30 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uc2e4\ud589\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "StepFly\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c TSG \ubc0f \uc0ac\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c \uc57d 94%\uc758 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \uae30\ub85d\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \uc801\uc740 \uc2dc\uac04\uacfc \ud1a0\ud070 \uc18c\ubaa8\ub85c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub610\ud55c StepFly\ub294 \ubcd1\ub82c \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c TSG\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 32.9%\uc5d0\uc11c 70.4%\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc8fc\ubaa9\ud560 \ub9cc\ud55c \uc2e4\ud589 \uc2dc\uac04 \ub2e8\ucd95\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 IT \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc0ac\uac74 \uad00\ub9ac\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0 \uac00\uc774\ub4dc(TSG)\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub4e4\uc758 \uc218\uc791\uc5c5 \uc2e4\ud589\uc740 \ub290\ub9ac\uace0 \uc624\ub958\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uae30 \uc27d\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc LLM\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \uc0ac\uac74 \uad00\ub9ac \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc740 TSG \ud488\uc9c8 \ubb38\uc81c \uad00\ub9ac, \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc81c\uc5b4 \ud750\ub984 \ud574\uc11d, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc9d1\uc57d\uc801\uc778 \uc9c8\uc758 \ucc98\ub9ac \ubc0f \uc2e4\ud589 \ubcd1\ub82c\uc131 \ud65c\uc6a9 \ub4f1 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc8fc\uc694 \uacfc\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc804\ubb38\uc801\uc778 \uc9c0\uc6d0\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 92\uac1c\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c TSG\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc600\uace0, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0 \uac00\uc774\ub4dc \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc5d4\ub4dc \ud22c \uc5d4\ub4dc \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 StepFly\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc758 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub97c \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc73c\ub85c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub294 SRE\uac00 TSG \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ub370 \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc744 \uc8fc\ub294 TSG Mentor \ub3c4\uad6c\uc640 \ud568\uaed8 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \uac00\uc774\ub4dc\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70;

However, existing approaches face two primary challenges: (i)\n\\textit{Ineffective group collaboration modeling}, as they rely on pairwise\nedge representations in graph structures, limiting their ability to capture\nrelationships among multiple agents; and (ii) \\textit{Limited task-adaptiveness\nin communication topology design}, leading to excessive communication cost for\nsimple tasks and insufficient coordination for complex scenarios. These issues\nrestrict the scalability and practical deployment of adaptive collaboration\nframeworks. To address these challenges, we propose \\textbf{HyperAgent}, a\nhypergraph-based framework that optimizes communication topologies and\neffectively captures group collaboration patterns using direct hyperedge\nrepresentations. Unlike edge-based approaches, HyperAgent uses hyperedges to\nlink multiple agents within the same subtask and employs hypergraph\nconvolutional layers to achieve one-step information aggregation in\ncollaboration groups. Additionally, it incorporates a variational autoencoder\nframework with sparsity regularization to dynamically adjust hypergraph\ntopologies based on task complexity.

However,\nexisting guardrails mostly operate post-execution, which is difficult to scale\nand leaves little room for controllable supervision at the plan level. To\naddress this challenge, we highlight three critical gaps in current research:\ndata gap, model gap, and evaluation gap. To close the data gap, we introduce\nAuraGen, a controllable engine that (i) synthesizes benign trajectories, (ii)\ninjects category-labeled risks with calibrated difficulty, and (iii) filters\noutputs via an automated reward model, producing large and reliable corpora for\npre-execution safety. To close the guardian model gap, we propose a\nfoundational guardrail Safiron, combining a cross-planner adapter with a\ncompact guardian model. The adapter unifies different input formats, while\nSafiron flags risky cases, assigns risk types, and generates rationales;\ntrained in two stages with a broadly explored data recipe, Safiron achieves\nrobust transfer across settings. To close the evaluation gap, we release\nPre-Exec Bench, a realistic benchmark covering diverse tools and branching\ntrajectories, which measures detection, fine-grained categorization,\nexplanation, and cross-planner generalization in human-verified scenarios.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate consistent gains of the proposed guardrail\nover strong baselines on Pre-Exec Bench, and ablations

Current\nevaluations of this ability in vision-language models (VLMs) are largely\nconfined to static, single-agent tasks. Inspired by Dixit, we introduce\nDixitWorld, a comprehensive evaluation suite designed to deconstruct this\nchallenge. DIXITWORLD features two core components: DixitArena, a dynamic,\nmulti-agent environment that evaluates both hypothesis generation (a\n\"storyteller\" crafting cryptic clues) and hypothesis selection (\"listeners\"\nchoosing the target image from decoys) under imperfect information; and\nDixitBench, a static QA benchmark that isolates the listener's task for\nefficient, controlled evaluation. Results from DixitArena reveal distinct,\nrole-dependent behaviors: smaller open-source models often excel as creative\nstorytellers, producing imaginative yet less discriminative clues, whereas\nlarger proprietary models demonstrate superior overall performance,\nparticularly as listeners. Performance on DixitBench strongly correlates with\nlistener results in DixitArena, validating it as a reliable proxy for\nhypothesis selection.

Under review", "summary": "Bias in large language models (LLMs) remains a persistent challenge,\nmanifesting in stereotyping and unfair treatment across social groups. While\nprior research has primarily focused on individual models, the rise of\nmulti-agent systems (MAS), where multiple LLMs collaborate and communicate,\nintroduces new and largely unexplored dynamics in bias emergence and\npropagation. In this work, we present a comprehensive study of stereotypical\nbias in MAS, examining how internal specialization, underlying LLMs and\ninter-agent communication protocols influence bias robustness, propagation, and\namplification. We simulate social contexts where agents represent different\nsocial groups and evaluate system behavior under various interaction and\nadversarial scenarios. Experiments on three bias benchmarks reveal that MAS are\ngenerally less robust than single-agent systems, with bias often emerging early\nthrough in-group favoritism. However, cooperative and debate-based\ncommunication can mitigate bias amplification, while more robust underlying\nLLMs improve overall system stability. Our findings highlight critical factors\nshaping fairness and resilience in multi-agent LLM systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc758 \ub3d9\uc801 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc758 \uac15\uac74\uc131, \uc804\ud30c \ubc0f \uc99d\ud3ed\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(MAS)\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc774 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744\u5f15\u304d\u8d77\u3053\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc744 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0, \ud3b8\ud5a5 \uae30\uc900\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 MAS\uc640 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "MAS\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc5d0 \ub35c \uac15\uac74\ud558\uba70, \uc911\uac04 \uadf8\ub8f9 \uc120\ud638\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ucd08\uae30\uc5d0 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ud611\ub825\uc801 \ubc0f \ud1a0\ub860 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc758\uc0ac\uc18c\ud1b5\uc774 \ud3b8\ud5a5 \uc99d\ud3ed\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ub354 \uac15\uac74\ud55c LLM\uc774 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc804\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc740 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c, \uc0ac\ud68c \uc9d1\ub2e8 \uac04\uc758 \uace0\uc815\uad00\ub150\uacfc \ubd88\uacf5\uc815\ud55c \ub300\uc6b0\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0a9\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uc804 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc8fc\ub85c \uac1c\ubcc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uc5c8\uc73c\ub098, \uc5ec\ub7ec LLM\uc774 \ud611\ub825\ud558\uace0 \uc18c\ud1b5\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(MAS)\uc758 \ub4f1\uc7a5\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc758 \ubc1c\uc0dd\uacfc \uc804\ud30c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc774 \ub3c4\uc785\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 MAS\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uace0\uc815\uad00\ub150 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc5ec \ub0b4\ubd80 \uc804\ubb38\ud654, \uae30\ubcf8 LLM \ubc0f \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc774 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc758 \uac15\uac74\uc131, \uc804\ud30c \ubc0f \uc99d\ud3ed\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \uc0ac\ud68c \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\ub294 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc744 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud558\uace0 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ubc0f \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud3b8\ud5a5 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, MAS\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc5d0 \ub35c \uac15\uac74\ud558\uba70, \uc885\uc885 \ub0b4\ubd80 \uadf8\ub8f9 \uc120\ud638\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc774 \uc870\uae30\uc5d0 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ud611\ub825\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud1a0\ub860 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc758\uc0ac\uc18c\ud1b5\uc740 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc758 \uc99d\ud3ed\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ub354 \uac15\uac74\ud55c \uae30\ubcf8 LLM\uc740 \uc804\uccb4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc1c\uacac\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 LLM \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uacfc \ud68c\ubcf5\uc131\uc744 \ud615\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Lifted training\nmethods offer an alternative by reformulating the nested optimisation problem\ninto a higher-dimensional, constrained optimisation problem where the\nconstraints are no longer enforced directly but penalised with penalty terms.\nThis chapter introduces a unified framework that encapsulates various lifted\ntraining strategies, including the Method of Auxiliary Coordinates, Fenchel\nLifted Networks, and Lifted Bregman Training, and demonstrates how diverse\narchitectures, such as Multi-Layer Perceptrons, Residual Neural Networks, and\nProximal Neural Networks fit within this structure. By leveraging tools from\nconvex optimisation, particularly Bregman distances, the framework facilitates\ndistributed optimisation, accommodates non-differentiable proximal activations,\nand can improve the conditioning of the training landscape. We discuss the\nimplementation of these methods using block-coordinate descent strategies,\nincluding deterministic implementations enhanced by accelerated and adaptive\noptimisation techniques, as well as implicit stochastic gradient methods.\nFurthermore, we explore the application of this framework to inverse problems,\ndetailing methodologies for both the training of specialised networks (e.g.,\nunrolled architectures) and the stable inversion of pre-trained networks.\nNumerical results on standard imaging tasks validate the effectiveness and\nstability of the lifted Bregman approach compared to conventional training,\nparticularly for architectures employing proximal activations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub525 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \uad50\uc721\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c

However, when deployed in real-world\nenvironments, they face serious security risks, motivating the design of\nsecurity evaluation benchmarks. Existing benchmarks provide only partial\ncoverage, typically restricted to narrow scenarios such as user-level prompt\nmanipulation, and thus fail to capture the broad range of agent\nvulnerabilities. To address this gap, we present \\tool{}, the first holistic\nbenchmark for evaluating the security of LVLM-based web agents. \\tool{} first\nintroduces a unified evaluation suite comprising six simulated but realistic\nweb environments (\\eg, e-commerce platforms, community forums) and includes\n2,970 high-quality trajectories spanning diverse tasks and attack settings. The\nsuite defines a structured taxonomy of six attack vectors spanning both\nuser-level and environment-level manipulations. In addition, we introduce a\nmulti-layered evaluation protocol that analyzes agent failures across three\ncritical dimensions: internal reasoning, behavioral trajectory, and task\noutcome, facilitating a fine-grained risk analysis that goes far beyond simple\nsuccess metrics. Using this benchmark, we conduct large-scale experiments on 9\nrepresentative LVLMs, which fall into three categories: general-purpose,\nagent-specialized, and GUI-grounded. Our results show that all tested agents\nare consistently vulnerable to subtle adversarial manipulations and reveal\ncritical trade-offs between model specialization and security. By providing (1)\na comprehensive benchmark suite with diverse environments and a multi-layered\nevaluation pipeline, and (2) empirical insights into the security challenges of\nmodern LVLM-based web

To address these challenges,\nwe introduce Traj-CoA, a multi-agent system involving chain-of-agents for\npatient trajectory modeling. Traj-CoA employs a chain of worker agents to\nprocess EHR data in manageable chunks sequentially, distilling critical events\ninto a shared long-term memory module, EHRMem, to reduce noise and preserve a\ncomprehensive timeline.

Static, rule-based systems\ndesigned for predictable environments are fundamentally ill-equipped to manage\nthe dynamic information flows inherent in agentic interactions. This position\npaper argues for a paradigm shift from binary access control to a more\nsophisticated model of information governance, positing that the core challenge\nis not merely about permission, but about governing the flow of information. We\nintroduce Agent Access Control (AAC), a novel framework that reframes AC as a\ndynamic, context-aware process of information flow governance. AAC operates on\ntwo core modules: (1) multi-dimensional contextual evaluation, which assesses\nnot just identity but also relationships, scenarios, and norms; and (2)\nadaptive response formulation, which moves beyond simple allow/deny decisions\nto shape information through redaction, summarization, and paraphrasing.

This survey maps the\nspace from foundations to practice. We first develop a taxonomy across\nlattice-, code-, hash-, multivariate-, isogeny-, and MPC-in-the-Head families,\nsummarizing security assumptions, cryptanalysis, and standardization status. We\nthen compare performance and communication costs using representative,\nimplementation-grounded measurements, and review hardware acceleration (AVX2,\nFPGA/ASIC) and implementation security with a focus on side-channel resistance.\nBuilding upward, we examine protocol integration (TLS, DNSSEC), PKI and\ncertificate hygiene, and deployment in constrained and high-assurance\nenvironments (IoT, cloud, finance, blockchain). We also discuss complementarity\nwith quantum technologies (QKD, QRNGs) and the limits of near-term quantum\ncomputing.

We introduce WARC-Bench (Web Archive\nBenchmark), a novel web navigation benchmark featuring 438 tasks designed to\nevaluate multimodal AI agents on subtasks. WARC-Bench enables sandboxed\ninteractions with dynamic and realistic webpages using Web ARChive files. We\nshow that WARC-Bench is challenging for leading computer-use models, with the\nhighest observed success rate being 64.8%. To improve open source models on\nsubtask, we explore two common training techniques: supervised fine-tuning\n(SFT) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). Experiments\nshow that SFT models obtain a 48.8% success rate on the benchmark. Training\nwith RLVR over SFT checkpoints, even in data-scarce settings, improves the\nscore to 52.8% on WARC-Bench, outperforming many frontier models.

This\ncollaborative approach generalizes well across diverse medical domains, proving\nespecially effective for telemedicine consultations and routine clinical\nscenarios, while providing interpretable decision-making pathways.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud1b5\ud569 \uc784\uc0c1 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c4\ub2e8\uacfc \uc57d\ubb3c \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c MedCoAct\ub77c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 \uc758\ub8cc AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uac1c\ubcc4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uba70 \uc9c4\ub2e8 \ud300\uc5d0\uc11c \ucc3e\uc544\ubcfc \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uad50\ucc28 \uac80\uc99d\uacfc \uc9c0\uc2dd \ud1b5\ud569\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\uc81c \uc758\ub8cc \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc774 \uc800\ud558\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "MedCoAct\ub294 \ud2b9\ubcc4\ud788 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc758\uc0ac \ubc0f \uc57d\uc0ac \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc784\uc0c1 \ud611\uc5c5\uc744 \ubaa8\uc0ac\ud558\ub294 \uc2e0\ub8b0 \uc778\uc2dd \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "MedCoAct\ub294 67.58%\uc758 \uc9c4\ub2e8 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc640 67.58%\uc758 \uc57d\ubb3c \ucd94\ucc9c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uac01\uac01 7.04% \ubc0f 7.08% \ub354 \uc6b0\uc218\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ud611\ub825\uc801 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc758\ub8cc \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0 \uc798 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub418\uba70, \uc6d0\uaca9 \uc9c4\ub8cc \uc0c1\ub2f4 \ubc0f \uc77c\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \uc784\uc0c1 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \ud2b9\ud788 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\uba70, \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc9c4\ub2e8 \ubc0f \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ubd84\uc11d\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uaca9\ub9ac\ub41c \uc758\ub8cc \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub180\ub77c\uc6b4 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc9c4\ub2e8 \ucd94\ub860\uacfc \uc57d\ubb3c \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569 \uc784\uc0c1 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud575\uc2ec \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uae30\uc874 \uc758\ub8cc AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc9c4\ub2e8 \ud300\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uacac\ub418\ub294 \uad50\ucc28 \uac80\uc99d \ubc0f \uc9c0\uc2dd \ud1b5\ud569 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uaca9\ub9ac\ud558\uc5ec \ucc98\ub9ac\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \uc758\ub8cc \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc774 \uac10\uc18c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uaca9\ub9ac \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \ud611\ub825\uc801 \uc811\uadfc\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud654\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 MedCoAct\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc804\ubb38 \uc758\uc0ac \ubc0f \uc57d\uc0ac \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc784\uc0c1 \ud611\uc5c5\uc744 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud558\ub294 \uc2e0\ub8b0 \uc778\uc2dd \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569 \uc9c4\ub2e8 \ubc0f \uce58\ub8cc \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc758\ub8cc AI \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 DrugCareQA\ub77c\ub294 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 MedCoAct\uac00 67.58%\uc758 \uc9c4\ub2e8 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc640 67.58%\uc758 \uc57d\ubb3c \ucd94\ucc9c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uac01\uac01 7.04% \ubc0f 7.08% \ub354 \uc6b0\uc218\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud611\ub825\uc801 \uc811\uadfc\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc758\ub8cc \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0 \uc798 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub418\uba70, \ud2b9\ud788 \uc6d0\uaca9 \uc9c4\ub8cc \uc0c1\ub2f4 \ubc0f \uc77c\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \uc784\uc0c1 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

If each AV, apart from minimizing its own\ntravel time, aims to reduce its impact on the system, this will be beneficial\nnot only for the system-wide performance but also for each individual player in\nthis routing game.\n  By introducing an intrinsic reward signal based on the marginal cost matrix,\nwe significantly reduce training time and achieve convergence more reliably.\nMarginal cost quantifies the impact of each individual action (route-choice) on\nthe system (total travel time). Including it as one of the components of the\nreward can reduce the degree of non-stationarity by aligning agents'\nobjectives. Notably, the proposed counterfactual formulation preserves the\nsystem's equilibria and avoids oscillations.\n  Our experiments show that training MARL algorithms with our novel reward\nformulation enables the agents to converge to the optimal solution, whereas the\nbaseline algorithms fail to do so. We show these effects in both a toy network\nand the real-world network of Saint-Arnoult.

In this paper, we study targeted backdoor\nattacks on VLA models and introduce TabVLA, a novel framework that enables such\nattacks via black-box fine-tuning. TabVLA explores two deployment-relevant\ninference-time threat models: input-stream editing and in-scene triggering. It\nformulates poisoned data generation as an optimization problem to improve\nattack effectivess. Experiments with OpenVLA-7B on the LIBERO benchmark reveal\nthat the vision channel is the principal attack surface: targeted backdoors\nsucceed with minimal poisoning, remain robust across variations in trigger\ndesign, and are degraded only by positional mismatches between fine-tuning and\ninference triggers. We also investigate a potential detection-based defense\nagainst TabVLA, which reconstructs latent visual triggers from the input stream\nto flag activation-conditioned backdoor samples. Our work highlights the\nvulnerability of VLA models to targeted backdoor manipulation and underscores\nthe need for more advanced defenses.", "AI": {"tldr": "VLA \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ubc31\ub3c4\uc5b4 \uacf5\uaca9\uc758 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud55c TabVLA \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "VLA \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ubc30\uce58\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \ubc31\ub3c4\uc5b4 \uacf5\uaca9\uc758 \uc548\uc804 \uc704\ud611 \uc99d\ub300.", "method": "TabVLA\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 \ubbf8\uc138\uc870\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \ud0c0\uac9f \ubc31\ub3c4\uc5b4 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud568.", "result": "OpenVLA-7B\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc73c\ub85c \ube44\uc804 \ucc44\ub110\uc774 \uc8fc\uc694 \uacf5\uaca9 \uba74\uacc4\uc784\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud558\uace0, \uc801\uc740 \uc624\uc5fc\uc73c\ub85c \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc778 \uacf5\uaca9\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90c.", "conclusion": "VLA \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud0c0\uac9f \ubc31\ub3c4\uc5b4 \uc870\uc791\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uace0, \ub354 \ubc1c\uc804\ub41c \ubc29\uc5b4\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud568\uc744 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud568.", "translated_summary": "\ube44\uc804-\uc5b8\uc5b4-\ud589\ub3d9(VLA) \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc2e4\uc81c \uad6c\ud604\ub41c AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc774 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub428\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \uc774\ub4e4\uc758 \ubc31\ub3c4\uc5b4 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc774 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \uc548\uc804 \uc704\ud611\uc774 \ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubc31\ub3c4\uc5b4\uac00 \uc788\ub294 VLA \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ubbf8\ub9ac \uc0bd\uc785\ub41c \ubc31\ub3c4\uc5b4\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc740\ubc00\ud558\uac8c \uc720\ub3c4\ub418\uc5b4 \uc801\ub300\uc801\uc778 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc2e4\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc2e4\ud328\ub098 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801\uc778 \ud53c\ud574\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

In this work, we derive BDT for (Bayesian) active learning in\nthe myopic framework, where we imagine we only have one more point to label.\nThis derivation leads to effective algorithms such as Expected Error Reduction\n(EER), Expected Predictive Information Gain (EPIG), and other algorithms that\nappear in the literature. Furthermore, we show that BAIT (active learning based\non V-optimal experimental design) can be derived from BDT and asymptotic\napproximations. A key challenge of such methods is the difficult scaling to\nlarge batch sizes, leading to either computational challenges (BatchBALD) or\ndramatic performance drops (top-$B$ selection). Here, using a particular\nformulation of the decision process, we derive Partial Batch Label Sampling\n(ParBaLS) for the EPIG algorithm.

We propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that\ncoordinates domain-specialized agents (e.g., focused on architecture,\nportraiture, and landscape imagery) within two coupled subsystems: a text\nenhancement module and an image generation module, each augmented with\nmultimodal integration components. Agents are trained using Proximal Policy\nOptimization (PPO) under a composite reward function that balances semantic\nsimilarity, linguistic visual quality, and content diversity. Cross-modal\nalignment is enforced through contrastive learning, bidirectional attention,\nand iterative feedback between text and image. Across six experimental\nsettings, our system significantly enriches generated content (word count\nincreased by 1614%) while reducing ROUGE-1 scores by 69.7%.

As a result, in recent years, there has been growing\ninterest in multitask or personalized strategies, which allow individual agents\nto benefit from one another in pursuing locally optimal models without\nenforcing consensus. Existing strategies require either precise prior knowledge\nof the underlying task relationships or are fully non-parametric and instead\nrely on meta-learning or proximal constructions. In this work, we introduce an\nalgorithmic framework that strikes a balance between these extremes. By\nmodeling task relationships through a Gaussian Markov Random Field with an\nunknown precision matrix, we develop a strategy that jointly learns both the\ntask relationships and the local models, allowing agents to self-organize in a\nway consistent with their individual data distributions.

A lot of high-quality text\nin the real world is private and cannot be freely used due to privacy concerns.\nTherefore, differentially private (DP) synthetic text generation has been\nproposed, aiming to produce high-utility synthetic data while protecting\nsensitive information. However, existing DP synthetic text generation imposes\nuniform guarantees that often overprotect non-sensitive content, resulting in\nsubstantial utility loss and computational overhead. Therefore, we propose\nSecret-Protected Evolution (SecPE), a novel framework that extends private\nevolution with secret-aware protection. Theoretically, we show that SecPE\nsatisfies $(\\mathrm{p}, \\mathrm{r})$-secret protection, constituting a\nrelaxation of Gaussian DP that enables tighter utility-privacy trade-offs,\nwhile also substantially reducing computational complexity relative to baseline\nmethods. Empirically, across the OpenReview, PubMed, and Yelp benchmarks, SecPE\nconsistently achieves lower Fr\\'echet Inception Distance (FID) and higher\ndownstream task accuracy than GDP-based Aug-PE baselines, while requiring less\nnoise to attain the same level of protection.

Reinforcement learning (RL) provides a promising path for\nimproving and fine-tuning VLAs through online interaction. However,\nconventional policy gradient methods are computationally infeasible in the\ncontext of flow-matching based models due to the intractability of the\nimportance sampling process, which requires explicit computation of policy\nratios. To overcome this limitation, we propose Flow Policy Optimization (FPO)\nalgorithm, which reformulates importance sampling by leveraging per-sample\nchanges in the conditional flow-matching objective. Furthermore, FPO achieves\nstable and scalable online reinforcement fine-tuning of the $\\pi_0$ model by\nintegrating structure-aware credit assignment to enhance gradient efficiency,\nclipped surrogate objectives to stabilize optimization, multi-step latent\nexploration to encourage diverse policy updates, and a Q-ensemble mechanism to\nprovide robust value estimation. We evaluate FPO on the LIBERO benchmark and\nthe ALOHA simulation task against supervised, preference-aligned,\ndiffusion-based, autoregressive online RL, and $\\pi_0$-FAST baselines,\nobserving consistent improvements over the imitation prior and strong\nalternatives with stable learning under sparse rewards. In addition, ablation\nstudies and analyses of the latent space dynamics further highlight the\ncontributions of individual components within FPO, validating the effectiveness\nof the proposed computational modules and the stable convergence of the\nconditional flow-matching objective during online RL.", "AI": {"tldr": "Flow Policy Optimization (FPO) \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744

MAS improves\ntask performance through role-based orchestration, while RL uses environmental\nrewards to learn stronger policies, such as GRPO-style optimization. However,\napplying on-policy RL to MAS remains underexplored and presents unique\nchallenges. Algorithmically, standard GRPO grouping assumptions break down\nbecause prompts vary by role and by turn. System-wise, the training stack must\nsupport MAS-workflow rollouts and on-policy updates for both single-policy and\nmulti-policy models.\n  We propose AT-GRPO, which includes (i) an agent- and turn-wise grouped RL\nalgorithm tailored to MAS and (ii) a training system that supports both single-\nand multi-policy regimes.

However, these agents remain vulnerable to a wide range of\nattacks, such as tool poisoning and malicious instructions, that compromise\ntheir execution flow and can lead to serious consequences like data breaches\nand financial loss. Existing studies typically attempt to mitigate such\nanomalies by predefining specific rules and enforcing them at runtime to\nenhance safety. Yet, designing comprehensive rules is difficult, requiring\nextensive manual effort and still leaving gaps that result in false negatives.\nAs agent systems evolve into complex software systems, we take inspiration from\nsoftware system security and propose TraceAegis, a provenance-based analysis\nframework that leverages agent execution traces to detect potential anomalies.\nIn particular, TraceAegis constructs a hierarchical structure to abstract\nstable execution units that characterize normal agent behaviors. These units\nare then summarized into constrained behavioral rules that specify the\nconditions necessary to complete a task. By validating execution traces against\nboth hierarchical and behavioral constraints, TraceAegis is able to effectively\ndetect abnormal behaviors. To evaluate the effectiveness of TraceAegis, we\nintroduce TraceAegis-Bench, a dataset covering two representative scenarios:\nhealthcare and corporate procurement.

In this work, we address these limitations by\nintroducing a primal approach and adopting a notion of exact Lipschitz\ncertificate to tighten this upper bound of WDRO. In addition, we propose a\nnovel Wasserstein distributional attack (WDA) that directly constructs a\ncandidate for the worst-case distribution. Compared to existing point-wise\nattack and its variants, our WDA offers greater flexibility in the number and\nlocation of attack points. In particular, by leveraging the piecewise-affine\nstructure of ReLU networks on their activation cells, our approach results in\nan exact tractable characterization of the corresponding WDRO problem.\nExtensive evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves competitive robust\naccuracy against state-of-the-art baselines while offering tighter certificates\nthan existing methods.

However, prevailing algorithms like GRPO broadcast a uniform advantage\nsignal across all tokens in a sequence. This coarse-grained approach overlooks\nthe pivotal role of uncertain, high-stakes decisions during reasoning, leading\nto inefficient exploration and the well-documented problem of entropy collapse.\nTo address this, we introduce UnCertainty-aware Advantage Shaping (UCAS), a\nmodel-free method that refines credit assignment by leveraging the model's\ninternal uncertainty signals. UCAS operates in two stages: it first modulates\nthe response-level advantage using the model's overall self-confidence, and\nthen applies a token-level penalty based on raw logit certainty.

However, existing research has focused exclusively on\nsingle-agent backdoor attacks, overlooking the novel attack surfaces introduced\nby agent collaboration in MAS. To bridge this gap, we present the first\nDistributed Backdoor Attack tailored to MAS. We decompose the backdoor into\nmultiple distributed attack primitives that are embedded within MAS tools.\nThese primitives remain dormant individually but collectively activate only\nwhen agents collaborate in a specific sequence, thereby assembling the full\nbackdoor to execute targeted attacks such as data exfiltration. To fully assess\nthis threat, we introduce a benchmark for multi-role collaborative tasks and a\nsandboxed framework to evaluate. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our\nattack achieves an attack success rate exceeding 95% without degrading\nperformance on benign tasks. This work exposes novel backdoor attack surfaces\nthat exploit agent collaboration, underscoring the need to move beyond\nsingle-agent protection.

Reinforcement learning agents typically rely on\nlarge samples of environment interactions to learn a policy. However, frequent\ninteractions with a (computer-simulated) environment may incur high\ncomputational costs, especially when the environment is complex. Our main\ninnovation is a new policy neural network architecture that consists of a\npretrained neural network middle section sandwiched between two fully-connected\nnetworks. Pretraining part of the network on a different environment with\nsimilar physics will help the agent learn the target environment with high\nefficiency because it will leverage a general understanding of the\ntransferrable physics characteristics from the pretraining environment. We\ndemonstrate that PPOPT outperforms baseline classic PPO on small training\nsamples both in terms of rewards gained and general training stability. While\nPPOPT underperforms against classic model-based methods such as DYNA DDPG, the\nmodel-free nature of PPOPT allows it to train in significantly less time than\nits model-based counterparts.

Watermarking has emerged as a promising\nsolution for source attribution, but existing techniques rely heavily on\nhand-crafted transformation rules, abstract syntax tree (AST) manipulation, or\ntask-specific training, limiting their scalability and generality across\nlanguages. Moreover, their robustness against attacks remains limited. To\naddress these limitations, we propose CodeMark-LLM, an LLM-driven watermarking\nframework that embeds watermark into source code without compromising its\nsemantics or readability. CodeMark-LLM consists of two core components: (i)\nSemantically Consistent Embedding module that applies functionality-preserving\ntransformations to encode watermark bits, and (ii) Differential Comparison\nExtraction module that identifies the applied transformations by comparing the\noriginal and watermarked code. Leveraging the cross-lingual generalization\nability of LLM, CodeMark-LLM avoids language-specific engineering and training\npipelines. Extensive experiments across diverse programming languages and\nattack scenarios demonstrate its robustness, effectiveness, and scalability.", "AI": {"tldr": "CodeMark-LLM\uc740 \uc758\ubbf8\ub97c \uc190\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc18c\uc2a4 \ucf54\ub4dc\uc5d0 \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uc0bd\uc785\ud558\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud0b9 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uc624\ud508 \uc18c\uc2a4 \ucf54\ub4dc\uc758 \ud655\uc0b0\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uc18c\uc2a4 \ucf54\ub4dc\uc758 \ubc30\ud3ec \ubc0f \uadc0\uc18d\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc724\ub9ac\uc801 \ubc0f \ubcf4\uc548 \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \ub300\ub450\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "CodeMark-LLM\uc740 \uae30\ub2a5 \ubcf4\uc874 \ubcc0\ud658\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud06c \ube44\ud2b8\ub97c \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ud558\ub294 \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \uc77c\uad00\uc131 \uc784\ubca0\ub529 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uacfc \uc6d0\ubcf8 \ucf54\ub4dc\uc640 \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud06c\uac00 \uc801\uc6a9\ub41c \ucf54\ub4dc\ub97c \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec \ubcc0\ud658\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \ucc28\ubcc4\uc801 \ube44\uad50 \ucd94\ucd9c \ubaa8\ub4c8\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d \uc5b8\uc5b4\uc640 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 CodeMark-LLM\uc758 \uac15\uac74\uc131, \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131 \ubc0f \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "CodeMark-LLM\uc740 LLM\uc758 \uad50\ucc28 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\ub9c1 \ubc0f \ud6c8\ub828 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \ud53c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uacfc \uc624\ud508 \uc18c\uc2a4 \ucf54\ub4dc\uc758 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc740 \ubb34\ub2e8 \uc7ac\ubc30\ud3ec, \ub77c\uc774\uc120\uc2a4 \uc704\ubc18 \ubc0f \uc545\uc758\uc801\uc778 \ubaa9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucf54\ub4dc \ub0a8\uc6a9 \ub4f1\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uc18c\uc2a4 \ucf54\ub4dc\uc758 \ubc30\ud3ec \ubc0f \uadc0\uc18d\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc724\ub9ac\uc801 \ubc0f \ubcf4\uc548 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc81c\uae30\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud0b9\uc740 \uc18c\uc2a4 \uadc0\uc18d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc73c\ub85c \ub5a0\uc62c\ub790\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874 \uae30\uc220\uc740 \uc218\uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uc791\ub41c \ubcc0\ud658 \uaddc\uce59, \ucd94\uc0c1 \uad6c\ubb38 \ud2b8\ub9ac(AST) \uc870\uc791 \ub610\ub294 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc791\uc5c5 \uad50\uc721\uc5d0 \uacfc\ub3c4\ud558\uac8c \uc758\uc874\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc5b4 \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uacfc \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc5b8\uc5b4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\uc131\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub354\uc6b1\uc774 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac15\uc778\uc131\ub3c4 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc758\ubbf8\ub098 \uac00\ub3c5\uc131\uc744 \uc800\ud558\uc2dc\ud0a4\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc18c\uc2a4 \ucf54\ub4dc\uc5d0 \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \ub0b4\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud0b9 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 CodeMark-LLM\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Whether they display\ngenuine strategic thinking, understood as the coherent formation of beliefs\nabout other agents, evaluation of possible actions, and choice based on those\nbeliefs, remains unexplored. We develop a framework to identify this ability by\ndisentangling beliefs, evaluation, and choice in static, complete-information\ngames, and apply it across a series of non-cooperative environments. By jointly\nanalyzing models' revealed choices and reasoning traces, and introducing a new\ncontext-free game to rule out imitation from memorization, we show that current\nfrontier models exhibit belief-coherent best-response behavior at targeted\nreasoning depths. When unconstrained, they self-limit their depth of reasoning\nand form differentiated conjectures about human and synthetic opponents,\nrevealing an emergent form of meta-reasoning. Under increasing complexity,\nexplicit recursion gives way to internally generated heuristic rules of choice\nthat are stable, model-specific, and distinct from known human biases. These\nfindings indicate that belief coherence, meta-reasoning, and novel heuristic\nformation can emerge jointly from language modeling objectives, providing a\nstructured basis for the study of

Existing learning-based approaches often neglect\npractical stability-related constraints and exhibit limitations in generalizing\nacross diverse bin dimensions. To address these limitations, we propose a novel\ndeep reinforcement learning framework, One4Many-StablePacker (O4M-SP). The\nprimary advantage of O4M-SP is its ability to handle various bin dimensions in\na single training process while incorporating support and weight constraints\ncommon in practice. Our training method introduces two innovative mechanisms.\nFirst, it employs a weighted reward function that integrates loading rate and a\nnew height difference metric for packing layouts, promoting improved bin\nutilization through flatter packing configurations.

While deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based\nprotocols enhance task-specified network performance, they suffer from poor\ngeneralizability and resilience, demanding costly retraining to adapt to\ndynamic environments. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a\ngame-theoretic LLM-empowered multi-agent DRL (MARL) framework, in which the\nuplink transmission between a base station and a varying number of user\nequipments is modeled as a dynamic multi-follower Stackelberg game (MFSG),\ncapturing the network's natural hierarchical structure. Within this game,\nLLM-driven agents, coordinated through proximal policy optimization (PPO),\nsynthesize adaptive, semantic MAC protocols in response to network dynamics.\nProtocol action grammar (PAG) is employed to ensure the reliability and\nefficiency of this process. Under this system, we further analyze the existence\nand convergence behavior in terms of a Stackelberg equilibrium by studying the\nlearning dynamics of LLM-empowered unified policies in response to changing\nfollowers. Simulations corroborate that our framework achieves a 77.6% greater\nthroughput and a 65.2% fairness improvement over conventional baselines.\nBesides, our framework generalizes excellently to a

This paper introduces an\nadvanced security framework that extends the Task-Based Access Control (TBAC)\nmodel by using a Large Language Model (LLM) as an autonomous, risk-aware judge.\nThis model makes access control decisions not only based on an agent's intent\nbut also by explicitly considering the inherent \\textbf{risk associated with\ntarget resources} and the LLM's own \\textbf{model uncertainty} in its\ndecision-making process. When an agent proposes a novel task, the LLM judge\nsynthesizes a just-in-time policy while also computing a composite risk score\nfor the task and an uncertainty estimate for its own reasoning. High-risk or\nhigh-uncertainty requests trigger more stringent controls, such as requiring\nhuman approval.

In contrast, current\nmedical benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) primarily assess knowledge\nrecall through single-turn questions, where complete clinical information is\nprovided upfront. To address this gap, we introduce VivaBench, a multi-turn\nbenchmark that evaluates sequential clinical reasoning in LLM agents. Our\ndataset consists of 1762 physician-curated clinical vignettes structured as\ninteractive scenarios that simulate a (oral) examination in medical training,\nrequiring agents to actively probe for relevant findings, select appropriate\ninvestigations, and synthesize information across multiple steps to reach a\ndiagnosis. While current LLMs demonstrate competence in diagnosing conditions\nfrom well-described clinical presentations, their performance degrades\nsignificantly when required to navigate iterative diagnostic reasoning under\nuncertainty in our evaluation. Our analysis identified several failure modes\nthat mirror common cognitive errors in clinical practice, including: (1)\nfixation on initial hypotheses, (2) inappropriate investigation ordering, (3)\npremature diagnostic closure, and (4) failing to screen for critical\nconditions. These patterns reveal fundamental limitations in how current LLMs\nreason and make decisions under uncertainty. Through VivaBench, we provide a\nstandardized benchmark for evaluating conversational medical AI systems for\nreal-world clinical decision support. Beyond medical applications, we\ncontribute to the larger corpus of research on agentic AI by demonstrating how\nsequential reasoning trajectories can diverge in complex decision-making\nenvironments.", "AI": {"tldr": "VivaBench\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \uc784\uc0c1 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911

However, existing works are mainly\nrestricted to tool-free tasks within isolated papers, largely due to the lack\nof a benchmark for cross-paper reasoning and multi-tool orchestration in real\nresearch scenarios. In this work, we propose PaperArena, an evaluation\nbenchmark for agents to address real-world research questions that typically\nrequire integrating information across multiple papers with the assistance of\nexternal tools. Given a research question, agents should integrate diverse\nformats across multiple papers through reasoning and interacting with\nappropriate tools, thereby producing a well-grounded answer. To support\nstandardized evaluation, we provide a modular and extensible platform for agent\nexecution, offering tools such as multimodal parsing, context retrieval, and\nprogrammatic computation. Experimental results reveal that even the most\nadvanced LLM powering a well-established agent system achieves merely 38.78%\naverage accuracy. On the hard subset, accuracy drops to only 18.47%,\nhighlighting great potential for improvement. We also present several empirical\nfindings, including that all agents tested exhibit inefficient tool usage,\noften invoking more tools than necessary to solve a task. We invite the\ncommunity to adopt PaperArena to develop and evaluate more capable agents for\nscientific discovery.

By leveraging LRMs' reasoning ability, these guardrails help the\nmodels to assess the safety of user inputs before generating final responses.\nThe powerful reasoning ability can analyze the intention of the input query and\nwill refuse to assist once it detects the harmful intent hidden by the\njailbreak methods. Such guardrails have shown a significant boost in defense,\nsuch as the near-perfect refusal rates on the open-source gpt-oss series.\nUnfortunately, we find that these powerful reasoning-based guardrails can be\nextremely vulnerable to subtle manipulation of the input prompts, and once\nhijacked, can lead to even more harmful results. Specifically, we first uncover\na surprisingly fragile aspect of these guardrails: simply adding a few template\ntokens to the input prompt can successfully bypass the seemingly powerful\nguardrails and lead to explicit and harmful responses. To explore further, we\nintroduce a bag of jailbreak methods that subvert the reasoning-based\nguardrails. Our attacks span white-, gray-, and black-box settings and range\nfrom effortless template manipulations to fully automated optimization. Along\nwith the potential for scalable implementation, these methods also achieve\nalarmingly high attack success rates (e.g., exceeding 90% across 5 different\nbenchmarks on gpt-oss series on both local host models and online API\nservices). Evaluations across various leading open-source LRMs confirm that\nthese vulnerabilities are systemic, underscoring the urgent need for stronger\nalignment techniques for open-sourced LRMs to prevent malicious misuse.

This\nsignificantly hinders the usefulness of such agents in environments where\ninteraction is costly (for example, when they interact with humans or reset\nphysical systems). While a number of existing LM agent architectures\nincorporate various mechanisms for experience storage and reflection, they make\nlimited use of LMs' abilities to directly generate or reason about full\ncounterfactual trajectories. We introduce ECHO (Experience Consolidation via\nHindsight Optimization), a prompting framework that adapts hindsight experience\nreplay from reinforcement learning for language model agents. ECHO generates\noptimized trajectories for alternative goals that could have been achieved\nduring failed attempts, effectively creating synthetic positive examples from\nunsuccessful interactions. Our approach consists of two components: a hindsight\nrule that uses the language model itself to identify relevant subgoals and\ngenerate optimized trajectories, and an update rule that maintains compressed\ntrajectory representations in memory. We evaluate ECHO on stateful versions of\nXMiniGrid, a text-based navigation and planning benchmark, and PeopleJoinQA, a\ncollaborative information-gathering enterprise simulation.

While reinforcement\nlearning (RL) has enabled impressive multi-step reasoning, we identify a\npreviously overlooked failure mode, Tool-Call Hacking, where agents inflate\nreward signals by issuing superficially correct tool calls without genuinely\nleveraging the retrieved evidence. This results in (i) mode collapse into\nrepetitive reliance on a single source and (ii) spurious grounding, where\nanswers are only weakly supported by cited content.\n  To address this, we propose Proof-of-Use (PoU), an evidence-grounded RL\nframework that enforces verifiable causal links between retrieved evidence,\nreasoning traces, and final answers.

Existing\nbenchmarks often lack real-world complexity and are thus unable to accurately\nassess LLMs' cybersecurity capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce\nPACEbench, a practical AI cyber-exploitation benchmark built on the principles\nof realistic vulnerability difficulty, environmental complexity, and cyber\ndefenses. Specifically, PACEbench comprises four scenarios spanning single,\nblended, chained, and defense vulnerability exploitations. To handle these\ncomplex challenges, we propose PACEagent, a novel agent that emulates human\npenetration testers by supporting multi-phase reconnaissance, analysis, and\nexploitation. Extensive experiments with seven frontier LLMs demonstrate that\ncurrent models struggle with complex cyber scenarios, and none can bypass\ndefenses.

Clinicians need tools that\ndetect adherence lapses promptly, yet current methods are either invasive\n(serum assays, neuroimaging) or proxy-based and inaccurate (pill counts,\npharmacy refills). We present the first noninvasive biomarker that detects\nantidepressant intake from a single night of sleep. A transformer-based model\nanalyzes sleep data from a consumer wearable or contactless wireless sensor to\ninfer antidepressant intake, enabling remote, effortless, daily adherence\nassessment at home. Across six datasets comprising 62,000 nights from >20,000\nparticipants (1,800 antidepressant users), the biomarker achieved AUROC = 0.84,\ngeneralized across drug classes, scaled with dose, and remained robust to\nconcomitant psychotropics.

Black-box methods presume access only to the\nmodel's outputs and often rely on training auxiliary reference models. While\nthey have shown strong empirical performance, they rely on assumptions that\nrarely hold in real-world settings: (i) the attacker knows the training\nhyperparameters; (ii) all available non-training samples come from the same\ndistribution as the training data; and (iii) the fraction of training data in\nthe evaluation set is known. In this paper, we demonstrate that removing these\nassumptions leads to a significant drop in the performance of black-box\nattacks. We introduce ImpMIA, a Membership Inference Attack that exploits the\nImplicit Bias of neural networks, hence removes the need to rely on any\nreference models and their assumptions. ImpMIA is a white-box attack -- a\nsetting which assumes access to model weights and is becoming increasingly\nrealistic given that many models are publicly available (e.g., via Hugging\nFace). Building on maximum-margin implicit bias theory, ImpMIA uses the\nKarush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions to identify training samples.\nThis is done by finding the samples whose gradients most strongly reconstruct\nthe trained model's parameters. As a result, ImpMIA achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance compared to both black and white box attacks in realistic settings\nwhere only the model weights and a superset of the training data are available.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubaa8\ub378 \ud6c8\ub828\uc5d0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \uacb0\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uba64\ubc84\uc2ed \ucd94\ub860 \uacf5\uaca9(MIA)\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\uc774\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ube14\ub799 \ubc15\uc2a4 \uacf5\uaca9 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ud604\uc2e4 \uc138\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uc8fc \uc720\uc9c0\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \uac00\uc815\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 ImpMIA\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud654\uc774\ud2b8 \ubc15\uc2a4 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc758 \uc554\ubb35\uc801 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub808\ud37c\ub7f0\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uac70\ud55c\ub2e4. \uacb0\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c ImpMIA\ub294 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4\uc640 \ud654\uc774\ud2b8\ubc15\uc2a4 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubaa8\ub378 \ud6c8\ub828\uc5d0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc758 \uc554\ubb35\uc801 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub808\ud37c\ub7f0\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uac70\ud55c \ud654\uc774\ud2b8 \ubc15\uc2a4 \uacf5\uaca9\uc778 ImpMIA\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud588\ub2e4.

While Multi-Tusk Learning (MTL) has emerged as a powerful\ncomputational paradigm for modeling longitudinal AD data, existing frameworks\ndo not account for the time-varying nature of feature correlations. To address\nthis limitation, we propose a novel MTL framework, named Feature Similarity\nLaplacian graph Multi-Task Learning (MTL-FSL). Our framework introduces a novel\nFeature Similarity Laplacian (FSL) penalty that explicitly models the\ntime-varying relationships between features. By simultaneously considering\ntemporal smoothness among tasks and the dynamic correlations among features,\nour model enhances both predictive accuracy and biological interpretability.

Existing AI-based analysis tools, ranging from\nAutoML frameworks to agentic research assistants, either favor automation over\ntransparency or depend on manual scripting that hinders scalability and\nreproducibility. We present ARIA (Automated Research Intelligence Assistant), a\nspec-driven, human-in-the-loop framework for automated and interpretable data\nanalysis. ARIA integrates six interoperable layers, namely Command, Context,\nCode, Data, Orchestration, and AI Module, within a document-centric workflow\nthat unifies human reasoning and machine execution. Through natural-language\nspecifications, researchers define analytical goals while ARIA autonomously\ngenerates executable code, validates computations, and produces transparent\ndocumentation. Beyond achieving high predictive accuracy, ARIA can rapidly\nidentify optimal feature sets and select suitable models, minimizing redundant\ntuning and repetitive experimentation. In the Boston Housing case, ARIA\ndiscovered 25 key features and determined XGBoost as the best performing model\n(R square = 0.93) with minimal overfitting. Evaluations across heterogeneous\ndomains demonstrate ARIA's strong performance, interpretability, and efficiency\ncompared with state-of-the-art systems.

However, the integration of DNNs also makes it vulnerable to\nadversarial attacks. Existing adversarial attack techniques mainly focus on\neither directly manipulating the environment with which a victim agent\ninteracts or deploying an adversarial agent that interacts with the victim\nagent to induce abnormal behaviors. While these techniques achieve promising\nresults, their adoption in multi-party open systems remains limited due to two\nmajor reasons: impractical assumption of full control over the environment and\ndependent on interactions with victim agents.\n  To enable adversarial attacks in multi-party open systems, in this paper, we\nredesigned an adversarial policy learning approach that can mislead\nwell-trained victim agents without requiring direct interactions with these\nagents or full control over their environments. Particularly, we propose a\nneutral agent-based approach across various task scenarios in multi-party open\nsystems. While the neutral agents seemingly are detached from the victim\nagents, indirectly influence them through the shared environment. We evaluate\nour proposed method on the SMAC platform based on Starcraft II and the\nautonomous driving simulation platform Highway-env.

The\nsearch space is \\(2^n\\), and the resulting complexity remains exponential even\nunder large constant-factor speedups (e.g., quantum or massively parallel\nhardware). Consequently, arbitrarily fast -- but not exponentially faster --\ncomputation does not obviate the need for informative labels or priors. In\npractice, the machine learning pipeline still requires an initial human\ncontribution: specifying the objective, defining classes, and providing a seed\nset of representative annotations that inject inductive bias and align models\nwith task semantics. Synthetic labels from generative AI can partially\nsubstitute provided their quality is human-grade and anchored by a\nhuman-specified objective, seed supervision, and validation. In this view,\ngenerative models function as \\emph{label amplifiers}, leveraging small\nhuman-curated cores via active, semi-supervised, and self-training loops, while\nhumans retain oversight for calibration, drift detection, and failure auditing.\nThus, extreme computational speed reduces wall-clock time but not the\nfundamental supervision needs of learning; initial human (or human-grade) input\nremains necessary to ground the system in the intended task.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc791\uc740 \ub808\uc774\ube14 \uc9d1\ud569 A\uc758 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud070 \ub808\uc774\ube14 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc9d1\ud569 B\uc758 \ub808\uc774\ube14\ub9c1\uc744 \uac80\uc0c9\ud558\ub294 \uc5ed\uac10\ub3c5 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub808\uc774\ube14 \uc5c6\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub808\uc774\ube14\ub9c1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc791\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc9d1\ud569\uc758 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \uc904\uc774\ub294 \ubaa9\ud45c\uac00 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "2^n\uc758 \uac80\uc0c9 \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud558\uba70, \uc591\uc790 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305 \ub610\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ubcd1\ub82c \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ud070 \uc0c1\uc218 \uc778\uc790 \uac00\uc18d\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ub3c4\uac00 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc9c0\uc218\uc801\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc810\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8f9\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ucd08\uae30 \uc778\uac04 \uae30\uc5ec\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ubaa9\ud45c \uba85\uc2dc, \ud074\ub798\uc2a4 \uc815\uc758 \ubc0f \uc9c0\uc2dd \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \uc8fc\uc785\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub300\ud45c\uc801\uc778 \uc8fc\uc11d\uc758 \uc2dc\ub4dc \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ucd08\uae30 \uc778\uac04 \ub610\ub294 \uc778\uac04 \ub4f1\uae09\uc758 \uc785\ub825\uc740 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc758\ub3c4\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\uc744 \ub450\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud070 \ub808\uc774\ube14 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc9d1\ud569 B\uc758 \ub808\uc774\ube14\ub9c1\uc744 \uac80\uc0c9\ud558\uc5ec \uc791\uc740 \ub808\uc774\ube14 \uc9d1\ud569 A\uc758 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc5ed\uac10\ub3c5 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac80\uc0c9 \uacf5\uac04\uc740 2^n\uc774\uba70, \uadf8 \uacb0\uacfc \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc740 \ud070 \uc0c1\uc218 \uc778\uc790 \uac00\uc18d (\uc608: \uc591\uc790 \ub610\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ubcd1\ub82c \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4) \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc9c0\uc218\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacb0\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \uc784\uc758\ub85c \ube60\ub978 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc774 \uc815\ubcf4\uc131 \ub808\uc774\ube14\uc774\ub098 \uc120\ud5d8\uc801 \uc694\uad6c\ub97c \ub300\uccb4\ud558\uc9c0\ub294 \ubabb\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\uc81c\ub85c, \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ucd08\uae30 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uae30\uc5ec\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: \ubaa9\ud45c \uba85\uc2dc, \ud074\ub798\uc2a4 \uc815\uc758, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uc720\ub3c4 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \uc8fc\uc785\ud558\uace0 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc758\ubbf8\uc640 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc815\ub82c\ud558\ub294 \ub300\ud45c\uc801\uc778 \uc8fc\uc11d\uc758 \uc2dc\ub4dc \uc9d1\ud569 \uc81c\uacf5. \uc0dd\uc131\ud615 AI\uc758 \ud569\uc131 \ub808\uc774\ube14\uc740 \ud488\uc9c8\uc774 \uc778\uac04 \uc218\uc900\uc774\uace0 \uc778\uac04\uc774 \uc9c0\uc815\ud55c \ubaa9\ud45c, \uc2dc\ub4dc \uac10\ub3c5 \ubc0f \uac80\uc99d\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uace0\uc815\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\ub2e4\uba74 \ubd80\ubd84\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub300\uccb4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc791\uc740 \uc778\uac04 \ud050\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ucf54\uc5b4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801, \ubc18\uac10\ub3c5, \uc790\uae30 \ud559\uc2b5 \ub8e8\ud504\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\ub294 \textit{\ub808\uc774\ube14 \uc99d\ud3ed\uae30}\ub85c \uae30\ub2a5\ud558\uba70, \uc778\uac04\uc740 \ubcf4\uc815, \ub4dc\ub9ac\ud504\ud2b8 \uac10\uc9c0 \ubc0f \uc2e4\ud328 \uac10\uc0ac\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uac10\ub3c5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uadf9\ub3c4\uc758 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc18d\ub3c4\ub294 \uc2dc\uac04 \uac10\uc18c\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uae30\ubcf8 \uac10\ub3c5 \ud544\uc694\ub97c \uc904\uc774\uc9c0\ub294 \uc54a\uc73c\uba70; \ucd08\uae30 \uc778\uac04 (\ub610\ub294 \uc778\uac04 \ub4f1\uae09) \uc785\ub825\uc740 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc758\ub3c4\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18 \ub46c\uc57c \ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, their open ended nature, where valid answers to \"How do\nI X?\" range from executable actions to high-level descriptions of X's\nsub-goals, makes them challenging for AI agents to ask, and for AI experts to\nanswer, in ways that support efficient planning. We introduce $How^{2}$, a\nmemory agent framework that enables agents to ask how-to questions, store the\nanswers, and reuse them for lifelong learning in interactive environments. We\nevaluate our approach in Plancraft, a Minecraft crafting environment, where\nagents must complete an assembly task by manipulating inventory items. Using\nteacher models that answer at varying levels of abstraction, from executable\naction sequences to high-level subgoal descriptions, we show that lifelong\nlearning agents benefit most from answers that are abstracted and decoupled\nfrom the current state. $How^{2}$ offers a way for LLM-based agents to improve\ntheir planning capabilities over time by asking questions in interactive\nenvironments.", "AI": {"tldr": "$How^{2}$ \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 '\uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c X\ub97c \ud558\ub294\uac00'\ub77c\ub294

A key challenge for realistic\nmulti-animal simulation in biology is bridging the gap between unknown\nreal-world transition models and their simulated counterparts. Because\nlocomotion dynamics are seldom known, relying solely on mathematical models is\ninsufficient; constructing a simulator that both reproduces real trajectories\nand supports reward-driven optimization remains an open problem. We introduce a\ndata-driven simulator for multi-animal behavior based on deep reinforcement\nlearning and counterfactual simulation. We address the ill-posed nature of the\nproblem caused by high degrees of freedom in locomotion by estimating movement\nvariables of an incomplete transition model as actions within an RL framework.\nWe also employ a distance-based pseudo-reward to align and compare states\nbetween cyber and physical spaces. Validated on artificial agents, flies,\nnewts, and silkmoth, our approach achieves higher reproducibility of\nspecies-specific behaviors and improved reward acquisition compared with\nstandard imitation and RL methods. Moreover, it enables counterfactual behavior\nprediction in novel experimental settings and supports multi-individual\nmodeling for flexible what-if trajectory generation, suggesting its potential\nto simulate and elucidate complex multi-animal behaviors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \ub3d9\ubb3c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18

Free-form\ninstructions such as recipes, scientific protocols, or business workflows\nencode rich procedural knowledge, but their variability and lack of structure\ncause agents driven by large language models (LLMs) to drift or fail during\nexecution. We introduce Procedure Aware DynaMic Execution (PADME), an agent\nframework that produces and exploits a graph-based representation of\nprocedures. Unlike prior work that relies on manual graph construction or\nunstructured reasoning, PADME autonomously transforms procedural text into\nexecutable graphs that capture task dependencies, decision points, and reusable\nsubroutines. Central to PADME is a two-phase methodology; Teach phase, which\nfocuses on systematic structuring, enrichment with executable logic of\nprocedures, followed by Execute phase, which enables dynamic execution in\nresponse to real-time inputs and environment feedback. This separation ensures\nquality assurance and scalability, allowing expert knowledge to be encoded once\nand reliably reused across varying contexts. The graph representation also\nprovides an inductive bias that reduces error accumulation in long-horizon\nreasoning, underscoring the importance of structured procedure modeling for\nreliable agent-driven automation. Empirically, PADME achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on four diverse benchmarks, including ALFWorld and ScienceWorld.\nThese results demonstrate that agents equipped with graph-based procedure\nrepresentations offer a powerful intermediate abstraction for robust and\ngeneralizable execution.", "AI": {"tldr": "PADME\ub294 \uc808\ucc28\ub97c \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud45c\ud604\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud574 \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uae34 \uc218\uba85 \uc8fc\uae30 \uc808\ucc28\ub97c \uc2e4\ud589\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4\ub85c \ub41c \uae34 \uc218\uba85 \uc8fc\uae30 \uc808\ucc28\ub97c \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2e4\ud589\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc9c0\ub2a5\ud615 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "PADME\ub294 \uc808\ucc28 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\uc5ec \uc791\uc5c5 \uc758\uc874\uc131, \uacb0\uc815 \uc9c0\uc810 \ubc0f \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud558\uc704 \ub8e8\ud2f4\uc744 \ucea1\ucc98\ud558\ub294 \ub450 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "PADME\ub294 ALFWorld \ubc0f ScienceWorld\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uae30\ubc18 \uc808\ucc28 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uac16\ucd98 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud558\uace0 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc2e4\ud589\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc911\uac04 \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uae34 \uae30\uac04 \uc808\ucc28\ub97c \uc2e4\ud589\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc9c0\ub2a5\ud615 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0\uac8c \ud575\uc2ec\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub808\uc2dc\ud53c, \uacfc\ud559 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c \ub610\ub294 \ube44\uc988\ub2c8\uc2a4 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc790\uc720 \ud615\uc2dd \uc9c0\uce68\uc740 \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \uc808\ucc28\uc801 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uadf8 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uacfc \uad6c\uc870 \ubd80\uc871\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc2e4\ud589 \uc911\uc5d0 drift\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc2e4\ud328\ud558\uac8c \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc808\ucc28 \uae30\ubc18 DynaMic Execution (PADME)\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc808\ucc28\uc758 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uae30\ubc18 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc218\uc791\uc5c5 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uad6c\uc131\uc774\ub098 \ube44\uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294 \uc774\uc804 \uc791\uc5c5\uacfc\ub294 \ub2ec\ub9ac, PADME\ub294 \uc808\ucc28\uc801\uc778 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \uc791\uc5c5 \uc758\uc874\uc131, \uacb0\uc815 \uc9c0\uc810 \ubc0f \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud558\uc704 \ub8e8\ud2f4\uc744 \ucea1\ucc98\ud558\ub294 \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub85c \uc804\ud658\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

We propose\nthe AI-Agent School (AAS) system, built around a self-evolving mechanism that\nleverages agents for simulating complex educational dynamics. Addressing the\nfragmented issues in teaching process modeling and the limitations of agents\nperformance in simulating diverse educational participants, AAS constructs the\nZero-Exp strategy, employs a continuous \"experience-reflection-optimization\"\ncycle, grounded in a dual memory base comprising experience and knowledge bases\nand incorporating short-term and long-term memory components.

We propose a framework\nwhere the relevant structural prior is simplicity (Solomonoff) understood as\n\\emph{compositional symmetry}: natural streams are well described by (local)\nactions of finite-parameter Lie pseudogroups on geometrically and topologically\ncomplex low-dimensional configuration manifolds (latent spaces). Modeling the\nagent as a generic neural dynamical system coupled to such streams, we show\nthat accurate world-tracking imposes (i) \\emph{structural constraints} --\nequivariance of the agent's constitutive equations and readouts -- and (ii)\n\\emph{dynamical constraints}: under static inputs, symmetry induces conserved\nquantities (Noether-style labels) in the agent dynamics and confines\ntrajectories to reduced invariant manifolds; under slow drift, these manifolds\nmove but remain low-dimensional. This yields a hierarchy of reduced manifolds\naligned with the compositional factorization of the pseudogroup, providing a\ngeometric account of the ``blessing of compositionality'' in deep models. We\nconnect these ideas to the Spencer formalism for Lie pseudogroups and formulate\na symmetry-based, self-contained version of predictive coding in which higher\nlayers receive only

As requirements grow, these\ndocuments expand rapidly, causing high computational overhead. This motivates\ndeveloping internalization methods that embed policy documents into model\npriors while preserving performance. Prior prompt compression work targets\ngeneric prompts, but agentic policy documents span multiple complexity levels\nand require deeper reasoning, making internalization harder. We introduce\nCC-Gen, an agentic benchmark generator with Controllable Complexity across four\nlevels, enabling systematic evaluation of agents' ability to handle complexity\nand offering a unified framework for assessing policy internalization. Our\nanalysis shows that complex policy specifications governing workflows pose\nmajor reasoning challenges. Supporting internalization with gold user agent\ninteraction trajectories containing chain-of-thought (CoT) annotations via\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) is data-intensive and degrades sharply as policy\ncomplexity increases. To mitigate data and reasoning burdens, we propose\nCategory-Aware Policy Continued Pretraining (CAP-CPT). Our automated pipeline\nparses policy documents to extract key specifications, grouping them into\nfactual, behavioral, and conditional categories, and isolating complex\nconditions that drive workflow complexity. This guides targeted data synthesis\nand enables agents to internalize policy information through an autoregressive\npretraining loss. Experiments show CAP-CPT improves SFT baselines in all\nsettings, with up to 41% and 22% gains on Qwen-3-32B, achieving 97.3% prompt\nlength reduction on CC-Gen and further enhancing tau-Bench with minimal SFT\ndata.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ube44\uc988\ub2c8\uc2a4 \uaddc\uce59\uc744 \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ud55c \uc815\ucc45 \ubb38\uc11c\ub97c \ubaa8\ub378

Despite advances in\nuncertainty-aware CCD methods, real-world uncertainties remain highly\nunpredictable. Multi-generation design addresses this challenge by considering\nthe full lifecycle of a product: data collected from each generation informs\nthe design of subsequent generations, enabling progressive improvements in\nrobustness and efficiency. Digital Twin (DT) technology further strengthens\nthis paradigm by creating virtual representations that evolve over the\nlifecycle through real-time sensing, model updating, and adaptive\nre-optimization. This paper presents a DT-enabled CCD framework that integrates\nDeep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to jointly optimize physical design and\ncontroller. DRL accelerates real-time decision-making by allowing controllers\nto continuously learn from data and adapt to uncertain environments. Extending\nthis approach, the framework employs a multi-generation paradigm, where each\ncycle of deployment, operation, and redesign uses collected data to refine DT\nmodels, improve uncertainty quantification through quantile regression, and\ninform next-generation designs of both physical components and controllers. The\nframework is demonstrated on an active suspension system, where DT-enabled\nlearning from road conditions and driving behaviors yields smoother and more\nstable control trajectories. Results show that the method significantly\nenhances dynamic performance, robustness, and efficiency. Contributions of this\nwork include: (1) extending CCD into a lifecycle-oriented multi-generation\nframework, (2) leveraging DTs for continuous model updating and informed\ndesign, and (3) employing DRL to accelerate adaptive real-time decision-making.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 Deep Reinforcement Learning(DRL)\uacfc Digital Twin(DT) \uae30\uc220\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc124\uacc4\uc640 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \uacf5\ub3d9 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uacf5\ub3d9 \uc124\uacc4(CCD) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub3d9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc790\uc728 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \ubc0f \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 Control Co-Design(CCD)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "Deep Reinforcement Learning(DRL)\uacfc Digital Twin(DT) \uae30\uc220\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud558\uace0, \ub2e4\uc138\ub300 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc218\uc9d1\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec DT \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ub2a5\ub3d9 \uc11c\uc2a4\ud39c\uc158 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c DT \uae30\ubc18 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub3c4\ub85c \uc870\uac74\uacfc \uc6b4\uc804 \ud589\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ub354 \ubd80\ub4dc\ub7fd\uace0 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \ub3d9\uc801 \uc131\ub2a5, \uac15\uac74\uc131 \ubc0f \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \uae30\uc5ec\ub294 CCD\ub97c \uc0dd\uc560 \uc8fc\uae30 \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \ub2e4\uc138\ub300 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uace0, DT\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\uc640 \uc815\ubcf4\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uba70, DRL\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc81c\uc5b4 \uacf5\ub3d9 \uc124\uacc4(CCD)\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801 \ubc0f \uc790\uc728 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \ubc0f \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uc778\uc2dd\ud55c CCD \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \uc2e4\uc81c \uc138\uacc4\uc758 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc608\uce21\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc138\ub300 \uc124\uacc4\ub294 \uc81c\ud488\uc758 \uc804\uccb4 \uc218\uba85 \uc8fc\uae30\ub97c \uace0\ub824\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uac01 \uc138\ub300\uc5d0\uc11c \uc218\uc9d1\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub294 \ud6c4\uc18d \uc138\ub300\uc758 \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \uc54c\ub824\uc8fc\uc5b4 \uac15\uac74\uc131\uacfc \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc758 \uc810\uc9c4\uc801 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \ud2b8\uc708(DT) \uae30\uc220\uc740 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \uac10\uc9c0, \ubaa8\ub378 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8, \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc7ac\ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc218\uba85 \uc8fc\uae30 \ub3d9\uc548 \uc9c4\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uac00\uc0c1 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \ub354\uc6b1 \uac15\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc124\uacc4\uc640 \uc81c\uc5b4\uae30\ub97c \uacf5\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 Deep Reinforcement Learning(DRL)\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c DT \uc9c0\uc6d0 CCD \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Inspired by the Overcooked game,\nParaCook provides an environment for various challenging interaction planning\nof multi-agent systems that are instantiated as cooking tasks, with a\nsimplified action space to isolate the core challenge of strategic parallel\nplanning. Through a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs, we find\nthat current approaches achieve suboptimal plans, which struggle with parallel\nactions or coordination. Our analysis also reveals LLMs' potential on abstract\ntasks where they can focus on high-level parallel optimization.

Steepest descent algorithms adapt to\ndifferent geometries through norm choices but remain strictly first-order,\nwhereas quasi-Newton and adaptive optimizers incorporate curvature information\nbut are restricted to Frobenius geometry, limiting their applicability across\ndiverse architectures. In this work, we propose a unified framework\ngeneralizing steepest descent, quasi-Newton methods, and adaptive methods\nthrough the novel notion of preconditioned matrix norms. This abstraction\nreveals that widely used optimizers such as SGD and Adam, as well as more\nadvanced approaches like Muon and KL-Shampoo, and recent hybrids including SOAP\nand SPlus, all emerge as special cases of the same principle. Within this\nframework, we provide the first systematic treatment of affine and scale\ninvariance in the matrix-parameterized setting, establishing necessary and\nsufficient conditions under generalized norms. Building on this foundation, we\nintroduce two new methods, $\\texttt{MuAdam}$ and $\\texttt{MuAdam-SANIA}$, which\ncombine the spectral geometry of Muon with Adam-style preconditioning. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that these optimizers are competitive with, and in some\ncases outperform, existing state-of-the-art methods.

However, current methods typically confine LLMs to the\nrole of an equation proposer within search algorithms like genetic programming.\nIn this paper, we present SR-Scientist, a framework that elevates the LLM from\na simple equation proposer to an autonomous AI scientist that writes code to\nanalyze data, implements the equation as code, submits it for evaluation, and\noptimizes the equation based on experimental feedback. Specifically, we wrap\nthe code interpreter into a set of tools for data analysis and equation\nevaluation.

We\nintroduce Multi-Agent Regime-Conditioned Diffusion (MARCD), which (i) infers\nlatent regimes via a Gaussian HMM, (ii) trains a diffusion model with a\ntail-weighted objective and a regime-specialized mixture-of-experts (MoE)\ndenoiser to enrich crisis co-movements, and (iii) feeds the generated scenarios\ninto a turnover-aware CVaR epigraph quadratic program with explicit governance.\nIn strict walk-forward tests on liquid multi-asset ETFs (2005-2025), MARCD\noutperforms standard allocators and improves calibration relative to popular\ngenerators. Over 2020-2025 out-of-sample (monthly; 10 bps), MARCD attains\nSharpe 1.23 (BL 1.02) and MaxDD 9.3 percent (BL 14.1 percent), a 34 percent\nreduction, at comparable turnover; stationary block-bootstrap intervals\nindicate the Sharpe uplift is significant at 5 percent. We provide theory\nlinking tail-weighted diffusion to spectral-risk control of the\ndecision-relevant CVaR gap, oracle/consistency results for the regime-MoE\ndenoiser, and Lipschitz/regret guarantees for the allocator.

We argue that these two\npolicies are bidirectionally interdependent and make the case for training the\ntwo jointly. We propose a joint learning approach based on developing shared\nrepresentations for the features used by the two policies.

To address\nthis, we propose MC# (Mixture-Compressor-sharp), a framework that combines\nstatic quantization and dynamic expert pruning by leveraging the significance\nof experts and tokens for aggressive compression of MoE-LLMs/VLMs. To reduce\nstorage and loading costs, we introduce Pre-Loading Mixed-Precision\nQuantization (PMQ), which optimizes bit allocation via linear programming,\nbalancing expert importance and quantization error for a Pareto-optimal\ntrade-off between size and performance. To reduce runtime computation, Online\nTop-any Pruning (OTP) uses Gumbel-Softmax sampling to dynamically select a\nsubset of experts per token, enabling fine-grained control over activation. By\ncombining PMQ's static bit-width optimization with OTP's dynamic routing, MC#\nachieves extreme compression with minimal accuracy loss.

While coreset selection provides a mechanism for efficient\ntraining on data subsets, current algorithms are designed for clean accuracy\nand fall short in preserving robustness. To address this, we propose a\nframework linking a sample's adversarial vulnerability to its\n\\textit{hardness}, which we quantify using the average input gradient norm\n(AIGN) over training. We demonstrate that \\textit{easy} samples (with low AIGN)\nare less vulnerable and occupy regions further from the decision boundary.\nLeveraging this insight, we present EasyCore, a coreset selection algorithm\nthat retains only the samples with low AIGN for training. We empirically show\nthat models trained on EasyCore-selected data achieve significantly higher\nadversarial accuracy than those trained with competing coreset methods under\nboth standard and adversarial training. As AIGN is a model-agnostic dataset\nproperty, EasyCore is an efficient and widely applicable data-centric method\nfor improving adversarial robustness.

We propose RFTHGS, a novel Reinforcement learning (RL) framework for\nFine-Tuning a small LLM to generate high-performance crossover operators for\nthe Hybrid Genetic Search (HGS) solver, applied to the Capacitated VRP (CVRP).\nOur method employs a multi-tiered, curriculum-based reward function that\nprogressively guides the LLM to master generating first compilable, then\nexecutable, and finally, superior-performing operators that exceed human expert\ndesigns. This is coupled with an operator caching mechanism that discourages\nplagiarism and promotes diversity during training. Comprehensive experiments\nshow that our fine-tuned LLM produces crossover operators which significantly\noutperform the expert-designed ones in HGS. The performance advantage remains\nconsistent, generalizing from small-scale instances to large-scale problems\nwith up to 1000 nodes. Furthermore, RFTHGS exceeds the performance of leading\nneuro-combinatorial baselines, prompt-based methods, and commercial LLMs such\nas GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc791\uc740 \uc804\ubb38\ud654\ub41c \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uac00 \uc124\uacc4\ud55c \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1\uc744 \ucd08\uc6d4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc790\ub3d9\ucc28 \uacbd\ub85c \ubb38\uc81c(VRP)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1 \uc124\uacc4\uc790\ub85c\uc11c LLM\uc758 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc791\uc740 LLM\uc744 \uc138\uc2ec\ud558\uac8c \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ud558\uc5ec Hybrid Genetic Search(HGS) \uc194\ubc84\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uace0\uc131\ub2a5 \uad50\ucc28 \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc790\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 RFTHGS \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ub41c LLM\uc774 HGS\uc5d0\uc11c \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uac00 \uc124\uacc4\ud55c \uad50\ucc28 \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc790\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\uac00 \ub098\uc654\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "RFTHGS\ub294 \uc120\ub3c4\uc801\uc778 \uc2e0\uacbd \uc870\ud569 \uae30\ucd08 \ubc0f \uc0c1\uc6a9 LLM\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc6b0\uc218\ud558\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc774 \ucc28\ub7c9 \uacbd\ub85c \ubb38\uc81c(VRP)\uc758 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1 \uc124\uacc4\uc790\ub85c \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc774 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc8fc\ub85c GPT-4\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc77c\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc138\uc2ec\ud558\uac8c \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ub41c \uc791\uc740 \uc804\ubb38 LLM\uc774 \uace0\uae09 \uc194\ubc84 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uac00 \uc81c\uc791\ud55c \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\ub294 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90c\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc774 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc5d0 \ub3c4\uc804\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc218\uc6a9\ub41c \ucc28\ub7c9 VRP(CVRP)\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ub41c \uace0\uc131\ub2a5 \uad50\ucc28 \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc790\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc791\uc740 LLM\uc744 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 RFTHGS\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 LLM\uc774 \ucc98\uc74c\uc5d0\ub294 \ucef4\ud30c\uc77c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0, \uadf8 \ub2e4\uc74c\uc5d0\ub294 \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uba70, \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\uac04 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc758 \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc790\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc810\uc9c4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc548\ub0b4\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ucee4\ub9ac\ud058\ub7fc \uae30\ubc18 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uad50\uc721 \uc911 \ud45c\uc808\uc744 \uc5b5\uc81c\ud558\uace0 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\ub294 \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc790 \uce90\uc2f1 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uacfc \uacb0\ud569\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\ub2e4. \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ub41c LLM\uc774 HGS\uc5d0\uc11c \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uac00 \uc124\uacc4\ud55c \uac83\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uad50\ucc28 \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc790\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \uc131\ub2a5 \uc6b0\uc704\ub294 \uc18c\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c\ubd80\ud130 \ucd5c\ub300 1000 \ub178\ub4dc\uc758 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub418\uc5b4 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uc720\uc9c0\ub41c\ub2e4. \ub354 \ub098\uc544\uac00, RFTHGS\ub294 \uc120\ub3c4\uc801\uc778 \uc2e0\uacbd \uc870\ud569 \uae30\ucd08\uc640 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\ubc95, GPT-4o \ubc0f GPT-4o-mini\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc0c1\uc6a9 LLM\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

This means that the linear\nclassification head, usually only a tiny fraction of the overall model, turns\ninto the main driver for compute and memory demand. Current state-of-the-art\nXMC methods predominantly rely on FP16-FP32 mixed-precision training, which we\nshow can be unstable, and inefficient in terms of memory usage and\ncomputational overhead. Meanwhile, existing low-precision methods typically\nretain higher precision for the classification layer. In this work, we propose\nELMO, a pure low-precision training framework for XMC models using BFloat16 and\nFloat8 data types. By leveraging Kahan summation and stochastic rounding, we\ndemonstrate that XMC models can be effectively trained entirely in Float8,\nwithout relying on single-precision master weights or tensor scaling.\nLow-precision training, combined with our proposed memory optimizations --\ngradient fusion and chunking -- enables significant reductions in GPU memory\nusage. For example, we train a 3-million-label XMC model with only 6.6 GiB of\nGPU memory, compared to the 39.7 GiB required by the optimized SOTA method,\nRenee without compromising accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uadf9\ub2e8\uc801\uc778 \ub2e4\uc911 \ub808\uc774\ube14 \ubd84\ub958(XMC)\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc21c\uc218 \uc800\uc815\ubc00\ub3c4 \ud6c8\ub828 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 ELMO\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, GPU \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub7c9\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uc904\uc774\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "XMC\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ud0dc\uae45 \ubc0f \uc81c\ud488 \uac04 \ucd94\ucc9c\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uba70, \ub808\uc774\ube14 \uc218\uac00 \uc218\uc2ed\ub9cc\uc5d0\uc11c \uc218\ubc31\ub9cc\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc774\ub985\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc804\uccb4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc791\uc740 \ubd80\ubd84\uc778 \uc120\ud615 \ubd84\ub958 \ud5e4\ub4dc\uac00 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305 \ubc0f \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc218\uc694\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc6d0\ub3d9\ub825\uc774 \ub428\uc744 \uc758\ubbf8\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "BFloat16 \ubc0f Float8 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc720\ud615\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 ELMO\ub77c\ub294 \uc800\uc815\ubc00\ub3c4 \ud6c8\ub828 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, Kahan \ud569\uc0b0 \ubc0f \ud655\ub960\uc801 \ubc18\uc62c\ub9bc\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec XMC \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 Float8\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "3\ubc31\ub9cc \ub808\uc774\ube14 XMC \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uc190\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub41c SOTA \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 Renee\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud55c 39.7 GiB\uc758 GPU \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 6.6 GiB\uc758 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc800\uc815\ubc00\ub3c4 \ud6c8\ub828\uacfc \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uae30\ubc95\uc778 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \uc735\ud569 \ubc0f \uccad\ud0b9\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uba74 GPU \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub7c9\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uc904\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ucd9c\ub825 \uacf5\uac04, \uc989 \uadf9\ub2e8\uc801\uc778 \ub2e4\uc911 \ub808\uc774\ube14 \ubd84\ub958(XMC)\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ud0dc\uae45 \ubc0f \uc81c\ud488 \uac04 \ucd94\ucc9c \ub4f1\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uba70, \ub808\uc774\ube14 \uc218\uac00 \uc218\uc2ed\ub9cc\uc5d0\uc11c \uc218\ubc31\ub9cc\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc774\ub974\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\uccb4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc791\uc740 \ubd80\ubd84\uc778 \uc120\ud615 \ubd84\ub958 \ud5e4\ub4dc\uac00 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305 \ubc0f \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc218\uc694\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc6d0\ub3d9\ub825\uc774 \ub41c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc758\ubbf8\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud604\uc7ac \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 XMC \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc8fc\ub85c FP16-FP32 \ud63c\ud569 \uc815\ubc00\ub3c4 \ud6c8\ub828\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294\ub370, \uc774\ub294 \ubd88\uc548\uc815\ud558\uace0 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub7c9\uacfc \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud55c\ud3b8 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc800\uc815\ubc00\ub3c4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ub958 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \uc815\ubc00\ub3c4\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 BFloat16 \ubc0f Float8 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc720\ud615\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 XMC \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc21c\uc218 \uc800\uc815\ubc00\ub3c4 \ud6c8\ub828 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 ELMO\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

In this work, we investigate the cross-domain generalization of\nan LLM agent equipped with a code interpreter tool, which is exclusively\ntrained on mathematical problem-solving tasks. Despite the restricted training\ndomain, we evaluate the agent's performance across several distinct reasoning\ndomains. The results reveal that RL-based tool usage learned from mathematical\ntasks can be effectively transferred to complex tasks in other domains,\nenabling great task performance and high token efficiency. To facilitate this\ncross-domain transfer, we propose a Tool Generalization Reinforcement Learning\n(TGRL) framework designed to promote domain-agnostic learning and skill\nmigration, encompassing: (i) a standardized tool interface that abstracts\ndomain-specific nuances through consistent formatting and explicit termination,\nfostering transferable invocation patterns; (ii) a dual-component reward system\nthat decomposes rewards to incentivize generalizable behaviors like tool\nefficiency and reasoning abstraction, ensuring alignment and robustness across\ndomain shifts; and (iii) an XML-based prompt template that separates thinking,\ntool calls, and responses to encourage modular, domain-invariant planning and\ncoherent multi-turn interactions.

Existing KV retrieval methods\nmitigate this by dynamically retaining only a subset of KV entries on the GPU.\nHowever, they still suffer from notable efficiency and accuracy bottlenecks due\nto per-token retrieval and coarse-grained page-level KV management, especially\nin long-output reasoning scenarios. With the emergence of large reasoning\nmodels, efficiently handling such scenarios has become increasingly important.\nTo address this issue, we present two key observations: (1) critical KVs\nexhibit strong temporal locality during decoding, and (2) these KVs exhibit\ndistinct distribution patterns across the input prompt and generated output.\nBuilding on these observations, we propose LouisKV, an efficient KV cache\nretrieval framework designed for various long-sequence scenarios. Specifically,\nLouisKV introduces a semantic-aware retrieval strategy leveraging temporal\nlocality to trigger retrieval only at semantic boundaries, drastically reducing\ncomputation and data transfer overhead. LouisKV also designs a decoupled,\nfine-grained management scheme that tailors differentiated strategies for input\nand output sequences to create retrieval units that better match the model's\nattention patterns, enabling precise identification of critical KVs.\nFurthermore, to boost efficiency, LouisKV incorporates several kernel-level\noptimizations, including custom Triton and CUDA kernels to accelerate the KV\nclustering and retrieval. Evaluations show that LouisKV achieves up to\n4.7$\\times$ speedup over state-of-the-art KV retrieval methods while\nmaintaining near-lossless accuracy across diverse long-sequence tasks,\nincluding long-input short-output, short-input long-output, and long-input\nlong-output scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "LouisKV\ub294 \uae34 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c

In this\nwork, we propose a pipeline leveraging multiple large language models (LLMs),\nclassifying papers based on descriptive prompts and deciding jointly using a\nconsensus scheme. The entire process is human-supervised and interactively\ncontrolled via our open-source visual analytics web interface, LLMSurver, which\nenables real-time inspection and modification of model outputs. We evaluate our\napproach using ground-truth data from a recent SLR comprising over 8,000\ncandidate papers, benchmarking both open and commercial state-of-the-art LLMs\nfrom mid-2024 and fall 2025. Results demonstrate that our pipeline\nsignificantly reduces manual effort while achieving lower error rates than\nsingle human annotators. Furthermore, modern open-source models prove\nsufficient for this task, making the method accessible and cost-effective.\nOverall, our work demonstrates how responsible human-AI collaboration can\naccelerate and enhance systematic literature reviews within academic workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744

We present ReLook, an agentic, vision-grounded\nreinforcement learning framework that empowers an agent to close a robust\ngenerate--diagnose--refine loop by invoking a multimodal LLM (MLLM) as a tool.\nDuring training, the agent uses the MLLM-in-the-loop both as a visual\ncritic--scoring code with screenshots--and as a source of actionable,\nvision-grounded feedback; a strict zero-reward rule for invalid renders anchors\nrenderability and prevents reward hacking. To prevent behavioral collapse, we\nintroduce Forced Optimization, a strict acceptance rule that admits only\nimproving revisions, yielding monotonically better trajectories. At inference,\nwe decouple the critic and run a lightweight, critic-free self-edit cycle,\nkeeping latency comparable to base decoding while retaining most of the gains.\nAcross three widely used benchmarks, ReLook consistently outperforms strong\nbaselines in vision-grounded front-end code generation, highlighting the\nbenefits of agentic perception, visual rewards, and training-inference\ndecoupling.", "AI": {"tldr": "ReLook\ub294 \ud504\ub860\ud2b8\uc5d4\ub4dc \uac1c\ubc1c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc798 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub80c\ub354\ub9c1\ub41c \ud53d\uc140\uacfc \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc815 correctness\uac00 \ud310\ub2e8\ub418\ub294 \ud504\ub860\ud2b8\uc5d4\ub4dc \uac1c\ubc1c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "ReLook\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec LLM(MLLM)\uc744 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc0dd\uc131-\uc9c4\ub2e8-\uac1c\uc120 \ub8e8\ud504\ub97c \uc644\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \uc2dc\uac01 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "result": "ReLook\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc744 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2a5\uac00\ud558\uc5ec \uc2dc\uac01 \uae30\ubc18 \ud504\ub860\ud2b8\uc5d4\ub4dc \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uc778\uc2dd, \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubc0f \ud6c8\ub828-\ucd94\ub860 \ubd84\ub9ac\uc758 \uc774\uc810\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ud504\ub860\ud2b8\uc5d4\ub4dc \uac1c\ubc1c\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud589\ub3d9 \ubd95\uad34\ub97c \ubc29\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac1c\uc120\ub41c \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \uc218\uc6a9 \uaddc\uce59\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc798 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub80c\ub354\ub9c1\ub41c \ud53d\uc140\uacfc \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud574 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc774 \ud310\ub2e8\ub418\ub294 \ud504\ub860\ud2b8\uc5d4\ub4dc \uac1c\ubc1c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 ReLook\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\ub294\ub370, \uc774\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec LLM(MLLM)\uc744 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc0dd\uc131-\uc9c4\ub2e8-\uac1c\uc120 \ub8e8\ud504\ub97c \uc644\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \uc2dc\uac01 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4. \ud6c8\ub828 \uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc2dc\uac01 \ube44\ud3c9\uac00\ub85c\uc11c \uc2a4\ud06c\ub9b0\uc0f7\uacfc \ud568\uaed8 \ucf54\ub4dc\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0, \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc2dc\uac01 \uae30\ubc18 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc758 \ucd9c\ucc98\ub85c MLLM\uc744 \ub8e8\ud504\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubb34\ud6a8 \ub80c\ub354\ub9c1\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \uc81c\ub85c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uaddc\uce59\uc740 \ub80c\ub354\ub9c1 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uace0\uc815\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud574\ud0b9\uc744 \ubc29\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud589\ub3d9 \ubd95\uad34\ub97c \ubc29\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uac1c\uc120\ub418\ub294 \uc218\uc815\ub9cc \ud5c8\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \uc218\uc6a9 \uaddc\uce59\uc778 \uac15\uc81c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4. \ucd94\ub860 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ube44\ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\uace0 \uacbd\ub7c9\uc758 \ube44\ud3c9\uac00 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc790\uae30 \ud3b8\uc9d1 \uc0ac\uc774\ud074\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc5ec \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \uc774\uc810\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uae30\ubcf8 \ub514\ucf54\ub529\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \ube44\uad50 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \uc720\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4.
