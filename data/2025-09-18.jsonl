Beyond enabling\nself-paced student practice, V-Math supports teachers by generating innovative,\ncompliant exam questions and building diverse, high-quality question banks.\nThis reduces manual workload and enriches instructional resources.

It allows\nLMMs to answer physical reasoning queries, such as the outcome of a potential\ncollision event from visual input. However, since parametric knowledge includes\nonly the physical laws seen during training, it is insufficient for reasoning\nwhen the inference scenario violates these physical laws. In contrast, humans\npossess the skill to adapt their physical reasoning to unseen physical\nenvironments from a few visual examples. This ability, which we refer to as\ninductive physical reasoning, is indispensable for LMMs if they are to replace\nhuman agents in safety-critical applications. Despite its importance, existing\nvisual benchmarks evaluate only the parametric knowledge in LMMs, and not\ninductive physical reasoning. To this end, we propose InPhyRe, the first visual\nquestion answering benchmark to measure inductive physical reasoning in LMMs.\nInPhyRe evaluates LMMs on their ability to predict the outcome of collision\nevents in algorithmically generated synthetic collision videos. By inspecting\n13 LMMs, InPhyRe informs us that (1) LMMs struggle to apply their limited\nparametric knowledge about universal physical laws to reasoning, (2) inductive\nphysical reasoning in LMMs is weak when demonstration samples violate universal\nphysical laws, and (3) inductive physical reasoning in LMMs suffers from\nlanguage bias and largely ignores the visual inputs, questioning the\ntrustworthiness of LMMs regarding visual inputs."}

Additionally, a more\ncritical challenge arises from the highly heterogeneous and unpredictable\nspatio-temporal distribution of users across the globe. In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel LLM-Assisted route Planning (LLMAP) system that employs an\nLLM-as-Parser to comprehend natural language, identify tasks, and extract user\npreferences and recognize task dependencies, coupled with a Multi-Step Graph\nconstruction with iterative Search (MSGS) algorithm as the underlying solver\nfor optimal route finding.

We propose ZTree, a novel decision tree learning framework that\nreplaces CART's traditional purity based splitting with statistically\nprincipled subgroup identification. At each node, ZTree applies hypothesis\ntesting (e.g., z-tests, t-tests, Mann-Whitney U, log-rank) to assess whether a\ncandidate subgroup differs meaningfully from the complement. To adjust for the\ncomplication of multiple testing, we employ a cross-validation-based approach\nto determine if further node splitting is needed. This robust stopping\ncriterion eliminates the need for post-pruning and makes the test threshold\n(z-threshold) the only parameter for controlling tree complexity. Because of\nthe simplicity of the tree growing procedure, once a detailed tree is learned\nusing the most lenient z-threshold, all simpler trees can be derived by simply\nremoving nodes that do not meet the larger z-thresholds. This makes parameter\ntuning intuitive and efficient. Furthermore, this z-threshold is essentially a\np-value, allowing users to easily plug in appropriate statistical tests into\nour framework without adjusting the range of parameter search. Empirical\nevaluation on five large-scale UCI datasets demonstrates that ZTree\nconsistently delivers strong performance, especially at low data regimes.\nCompared to CART, ZTree also tends to grow simpler trees without sacrificing\nperformance.

Specifically, we design an AAI architecture comprising\ndedicated agents for cyber-threat detection and response at charging stations,\nreal-time State of Charge (SoC) estimation, and State of Health (SoH) anomaly\ndetection, all coordinated through a shared, explainable reasoning layer;\ndevelop interpretable threat-mitigation mechanisms that proactively identify\nand neutralize attacks on both physical charging points and learning\ncomponents; propose resilient SoC and SoH models that leverage continuous and\nadversarial-aware learning to produce accurate, uncertainty-aware forecasts\nwith human-readable explanations; and implement a three-agent pipeline, where\neach agent uses LLM-driven reasoning and dynamic tool invocation to interpret\nintent, contextualize tasks, and execute formal optimizations for user-centric\nassistance.

It allows\nLMMs to answer physical reasoning queries, such as the outcome of a potential\ncollision event from visual input. However, since parametric knowledge includes\nonly the physical laws seen during training, it is insufficient for reasoning\nwhen the inference scenario violates these physical laws. In contrast, humans\npossess the skill to adapt their physical reasoning to unseen physical\nenvironments from a few visual examples. This ability, which we refer to as\ninductive physical reasoning, is indispensable for LMMs if they are to replace\nhuman agents in safety-critical applications. Despite its importance, existing\nvisual benchmarks evaluate only the parametric knowledge in LMMs, and not\ninductive physical reasoning. To this end, we propose InPhyRe, the first visual\nquestion answering benchmark to measure inductive physical reasoning in LMMs.\nInPhyRe evaluates LMMs on their ability to predict the outcome of collision\nevents in algorithmically generated synthetic collision videos. By inspecting\n13 LMMs, InPhyRe informs us that (1) LMMs struggle to apply their limited\nparametric knowledge about universal physical laws to reasoning, (2) inductive\nphysical reasoning in LMMs is weak when demonstration samples violate universal\nphysical laws, and (3) inductive physical reasoning in LMMs suffers from\nlanguage bias and largely ignores the visual inputs, questioning the\ntrustworthiness of LMMs regarding visual inputs."}

However, LLMs in the former\napproach struggle to handle extensive map data, while the latter shows limited\ncapability in understanding natural language preferences. Additionally, a more\ncritical challenge arises from the highly heterogeneous and unpredictable\nspatio-temporal distribution of users across the globe. In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel LLM-Assisted route Planning (LLMAP) system that employs an\nLLM-as-Parser to comprehend natural language, identify tasks, and extract user\npreferences and recognize task dependencies, coupled with a Multi-Step Graph\nconstruction with iterative Search (MSGS) algorithm as the underlying solver\nfor optimal route finding. Our multi-objective optimization approach adaptively\ntunes objective weights to maximize points of interest (POI) quality and task\ncompletion rate while minimizing route distance, subject to three key\nconstraints: user time limits, POI opening hours, and task dependencies. We\nconduct extensive experiments using 1,000 routing prompts sampled with varying\ncomplexity across 14 countries and 27 cities worldwide. The results demonstrate\nthat our approach achieves superior performance with guarantees across multiple\nconstraints."}

Since our development is still in\nan early stage, we present here the first experiments with AIssistant for\nperspective and review research papers in machine learning. Our system\nintegrates modular tools and agents for literature synthesis, section-wise\nexperimentation, citation management, and automatic LaTeX paper text\ngeneration, while maintaining human oversight at every stage to ensure\naccuracy, coherence, and scholarly rigour. We conducted a comprehensive\nevaluation across three layers: (1) Independent Human Review, following NeurIPS\ndouble-blind standards; (2) Automated LLM Review, using GPT-5 as a scalable\nhuman review proxy; and (3) Program Chair Oversight, where the chair monitors\nthe entire review process and makes final validation and acceptance decisions.\nThe results demonstrate that AIssistant improves drafting efficiency and\nthematic consistency.

To address this, we introduce HLSMAC, a new cooperative MARL\nbenchmark with 12 carefully designed StarCraft II scenarios based on classical\nstratagems from the Thirty-Six Stratagems. Each scenario corresponds to a\nspecific stratagem and is designed to challenge agents with diverse strategic\nelements, including tactical maneuvering, timing coordination, and deception,\nthereby opening up avenues for evaluating high-level strategic decision-making\ncapabilities.
