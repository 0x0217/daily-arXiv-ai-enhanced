Keywords: LLM security;\n  defense-in-depth; prompt injection; activation steering; multimodal sandbox;\n  threat modeling", "summary": "The security of Large Language Model (LLM) applications is fundamentally\nchallenged by \"form-first\" attacks like prompt injection and jailbreaking,\nwhere malicious instructions are embedded within user inputs. Conventional\ndefenses, which rely on post hoc output filtering, are often brittle and fail\nto address the root cause: the model's inability to distinguish trusted\ninstructions from untrusted data. This paper proposes Countermind, a\nmulti-layered security architecture intended to shift defenses from a reactive,\npost hoc posture to a proactive, pre-inference, and intra-inference enforcement\nmodel. The architecture proposes a fortified perimeter designed to structurally\nvalidate and transform all inputs, and an internal governance mechanism\nintended to constrain the model's semantic processing pathways before an output\nis generated. The primary contributions of this work are conceptual designs\nfor: (1) A Semantic Boundary Logic (SBL) with a mandatory, time-coupled Text\nCrypter intended to reduce the plaintext prompt injection attack surface,\nprovided all ingestion paths are enforced. (2) A Parameter-Space Restriction\n(PSR) mechanism, leveraging principles from representation engineering, to\ndynamically control the LLM's access to internal semantic clusters, with the\ngoal of mitigating semantic drift and dangerous emergent behaviors. (3) A\nSecure, Self-Regulating Core that uses an OODA loop and a learning security\nmodule to adapt its defenses based on an immutable audit log. (4) A Multimodal\nInput Sandbox and Context-Defense mechanisms to address threats from\nnon-textual data and long-term semantic poisoning. This paper outlines an\nevaluation plan designed to quantify the proposed architecture's effectiveness\nin reducing the Attack Success Rate (ASR) for form-first attacks and to measure\nits potential latency overhead."}

With the\nnatural language understanding and reasoning capabilities of large language\nmodels (LLMs), there is increasing interest in applying them to CTI, which\ncalls for benchmarks that can rigorously evaluate their performance. Several\nearly efforts have studied LLMs on some CTI tasks but remain limited: (i) they\nadopt only closed-book settings, relying on parametric knowledge without\nleveraging CTI knowledge bases; (ii) they cover only a narrow set of tasks,\nlacking a systematic view of the CTI landscape; and (iii) they restrict\nevaluation to single-source analysis, unlike realistic scenarios that require\nreasoning across multiple sources. To fill these gaps, we present CTIArena, the\nfirst benchmark for evaluating LLM performance on heterogeneous, multi-source\nCTI under knowledge-augmented settings. CTIArena spans three categories,\nstructured, unstructured, and hybrid, further divided into nine tasks that\ncapture the breadth of CTI analysis in modern security operations. We evaluate\nten widely used LLMs and find that most struggle in closed-book setups but show\nnoticeable gains when augmented with security-specific knowledge through our\ndesigned retrieval-augmented techniques. These findings highlight the\nlimitations of general-purpose LLMs and the need for domain-tailored techniques\nto fully unlock their potential for CTI."}

To address this issue, domain generalization\napproaches have recently been studied to ensure generalized performance on\nunseen domains during training. Among those techniques, contrastive learning\nhas proven its validity in learning domain-invariant features by aligning\nsamples of the same class across different domains. Despite its potential, many\nexisting methods are insufficient to extract adequately domain-invariant\nrepresentations, as they do not explicitly address domain characteristics\nembedded within the unshared information across samples. In this paper, we\nposit that mitigating such domain-relevant attributes-referred to as excess\ndomain-relevant information-is key to bridging the domain gap. However, the\ndirect strategy to mitigate the domain-relevant attributes often overfits\nfeatures at the high-level information, limiting their ability to leverage the\ndiverse temporal and spectral information encoded in the multiple feature\nlevels. To address these limitations, we propose a novel MEASURE (Multi-scalE\nminimAl SUfficient Representation lEarning) framework, which effectively\nreduces domain-relevant information while preserving essential temporal and\nspectral features for sleep stage classification.

In practice, AFA methods often learn from\nretrospective data with systematic missingness in the features and limited\ntask-specific labels. Most prior work addresses acquisition for a single\npredetermined task, limiting scalability. To address this limitation, we\nformalize the meta-AFA problem, where the goal is to learn acquisition policies\nacross various tasks. We introduce Learning-to-Measure (L2M), which consists of\ni) reliable uncertainty quantification over unseen tasks, and ii) an\nuncertainty-guided greedy feature acquisition agent that maximizes conditional\nmutual information. We demonstrate a sequence-modeling or autoregressive\npre-training approach that underpins reliable uncertainty quantification for\ntasks with arbitrary missingness.
