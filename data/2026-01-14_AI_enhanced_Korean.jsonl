However, recent studies show that FL models may still leak sensitive information through their outputs, motivating the need for rigorous privacy evaluation. In this paper, we leverage membership inference attacks (MIA) as a quantitative privacy measurement framework for FL applied to remote sensing image classification. We evaluate multiple black-box MIA techniques, including entropy-based attacks, modified entropy attacks, and the likelihood ratio attack, across different FL algorithms and communication strategies. Experiments conducted on two public scene classification datasets demonstrate that MIA effectively reveals privacy leakage not captured by accuracy alone. Our results show that communication-efficient FL strategies reduce MIA success rates while maintaining competitive performance. These findings confirm MIA as a practical metric and highlight the importance of integrating privacy measurement into FL system design for remote sensing applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc5f0\ud569

Current generative models operate as \"black boxes\" with limited user control and lack built-in mechanisms to protect intellectual property or trace content origin. We propose a novel multi-agent framework that addresses these challenges through specialized agent roles and integrated watermarking. Our system orchestrates Director, Generator, Reviewer, Integration, and Protection agents to ensure user intent alignment while embedding digital provenance markers. We demonstrate feasibility through two case studies: creative content generation with iterative refinement and copyright protection for AI-generated art in commercial contexts. Preliminary feasibility evidence from prior work indicates up to 23\\% improvement in semantic alignment and 95\\% watermark recovery rates.

We argue that large language models (LLMs) have democratized web scraping, enabling low-skill users to execute sophisticated operations through simple natural language prompts. While extensive benchmarks evaluate these tools under optimal expert conditions, we show that without extensive manual effort, current LLM-based workflows allow novice users to scrape complex websites that would otherwise be inaccessible. We systematically benchmark what everyday users can do with off-the-shelf LLM tools across 35 sites spanning five security tiers, including authentication, anti-bot, and CAPTCHA controls. We devise and evaluate two distinct workflows: (a) LLM-assisted scripting, where users prompt LLMs to generate traditional scraping code but maintain manual execution control, and (b) end-to-end LLM agents, which autonomously navigate and extract data through integrated tool use. Our results demonstrate that end-to-end agents have made complex scraping accessible - requiring as little as a single prompt with minimal refinement (less than 5 changes) to complete workflows. We also highlight scenarios where LLM-assisted scripting may be simpler and faster for static sites. In light of these findings, we provide simple procedures for novices to use these workflows and gauge what adversaries could achieve using these.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc6f9 \uc2a4\ud06c\ub798\ud551\uc744 \ubbfc\uc8fc\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \ube44\uc219\ub828 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\ub3c4 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc6f9\uc0ac\uc774\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc6f9 \uc2a4\ud06c\ub798\ud551\uc740 \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uae30\uc220\uc801 \uc804\ubb38\uc131\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud588\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc219\ub828\ub41c \uac1c\ubc1c\uc790\ub9cc \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ucd94\ucd9c\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud588\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uae30\uc874 LLM \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\ub4e4\uc774 35\uac1c\uc758 \uc6f9\uc0ac\uc774\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uc99d, \uc548\ud2f0 \ubd07 \ubc0f CAPTCHA \uc81c\uc5b4\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c 5\uac00\uc9c0 \ubcf4\uc548 \uacc4\uce35\uc744 \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \uc6f9 \uc2a4\ud06c\ub798\ud551\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud750\ub984\uc744 \uace0\uc548\ud558\uace0 \ud3c9\uac00\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4: LLM \uc9c0\uc6d0 \uc2a4\ud06c\ub9bd\ud305\uacfc \uc885\ub2e8\uac04 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8, \ud6c4\uc790\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\uace0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc885\ub2e8\uac04 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc6f9 \uc2a4\ud06c\ub798\ud551\uc744 \uc811\uadfc \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4e4\uc5b4 \ub2e8 \ud558\ub098\uc758 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub85c \ucd5c\uc18c\ud55c\uc758 \uc218\uc815(5\ud68c \ubbf8\ub9cc)\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c\ub3c4 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud750\ub984\uc744 \uc644\ub8cc\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ucd08\ubcf4\uc790\uac00 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5 \ud750\ub984\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ub3d5\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \uc808\ucc28\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uc545\uc758\uc801\uc778 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uac00 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc5b4\ub5a4 \uc77c\uc744 \ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0 \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6f9 \uc2a4\ud06c\ub798\ud551\uc740 \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801\uc73c\ub85c HTML \ud30c\uc2f1, \uc138\uc158 \uad00\ub9ac, \uc778\uc99d \ud68c\ud53c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uae30\uc220 \uc804\ubb38 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud588\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ucd94\ucd9c\uc744 \uc219\ub828\ub41c \uac1c\ubc1c\uc790\uc5d0\uac8c \uc81c\ud55c\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc774 \uc6f9 \uc2a4\ud06c\ub798\ud551\uc744 \ubbfc\uc8fc\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \uc800\uc219\ub828 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\ub4e4\uc774 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud588\ub2e4\uace0 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uac00 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc870\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ubc18\uba74, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc218\uc791\uc5c5 \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 \ud604\uc7ac LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\uac00 \ucd08\ubcf4\uc790\uac00 \uc811\uadfc\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc6f9\uc0ac\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \uc2a4\ud06c\ub798\ud551\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud574\uc900\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc778\uc99d, \uc548\ud2f0 \ubd07 \ubc0f CAPTCHA \uc81c\uc5b4\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uc5ec 5\uac00\uc9c0 \ubcf4\uc548 \uacc4\uce35\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 35\uac1c \uc0ac\uc774\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 LLM \ub3c4\uad6c\ub85c \uc77c\uc0c1 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\ub4e4\uc774 \ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud0b9\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud750\ub984\uc744 \uace0\uc548\ud558\uace0 \ud3c9\uac00\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4: (a) LLM \uc9c0\uc6d0 \uc2a4\ud06c\ub9bd\ud305, \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uac00 LLM\uc5d0 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc5ec \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc2a4\ud06c\ub798\ud551 \ucf54\ub4dc\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc218\ub3d9 \uc2e4\ud589 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Although projecting empirical choice data onto the RUM polytope is NP-hard in general, we uncover an isomorphism between RUM consistency and flow conservation on the Boolean lattice. Leveraging this combinatorial structure, we derive a novel Tree-Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient solver. By exploiting the spanning tree of the constraint graph, our preconditioner effectively \"whitens\" the ill-conditioned Hessian spectrum induced by the Interior Point Method barrier, achieving superlinear convergence and scaling to problem sizes previously deemed unsolvable. We further formulate the projection as a differentiable layer via the Implicit Function Theorem, where the exact Jacobian propagates geometric constraints during backpropagation. Empirical results demonstrate that this \"Axioms-as-Layers\" paradigm eliminates the structural overfitting inherent in penalty-based methods, enabling models that are jointly trainable, provably rational, and capable of generalizing from sparse data regimes where standard approximations fail.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub79c\ub364 \uc720\ud2f8\ub9ac\ud2f0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uacf5\ub9ac\uc801 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ub525 \ub274\ub7f4 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uc811 \uc784\ubca0\ub4dc\ud558\ub294 \ubbf8\ubd84 \uac00\ub2a5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub79c\ub364 \uc720\ud2f8\ub9ac\ud2f0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uacfc\uc801\ud569 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubd88\ub9ac\uc5b8 \uaca9\uc790\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud750\ub984 \ubcf4\uc874\uacfc RUM \uc77c\uad00\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \ub3d9\ud615\uc131\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 Tree-Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient \uc194\ubc84\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc194\ubc84\ub294 \uc81c\uc57d \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc758 \uc2a4\ud328\ub2dd \ud2b8\ub9ac\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec Interior Point Method \uc7a5\ubcbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \ub354\ub7ec\uc6b4 \ud574\uc2dc\uc548 \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c '\ud654\uc774\ud2b8\ub2dd'\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \ubb38\uc81c \ud06c\uae30\uc5d0 \uad6c\uc560\ubc1b\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \ucd08\uc120\ud615 \uc218\ub834\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uae30\uc874\uc5d0 \ud480 \uc218 \uc5c6\uc5c8\ub358 \ubb38\uc81c\ub4e4\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 '\uacf5\ub9ac-\uacc4\uce35' \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc740 \ucc98\ubc8c \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0\uc11c \ub0b4\uc7ac\ub41c \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uacfc\uc801\ud569\uc744 \uc81c\uac70\ud558\uace0, \uacf5\ub3d9 \ud559\uc2b5\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uba70, \ud569\ub9ac\uc131\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud558\uace0, \ud45c\uc900 \uadfc\uc0ac\ubc95\uc774 \uc2e4\ud328\ud558\ub294 \ud76c\uc18c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub79c\ub364 \uc720\ud2f8\ub9ac\ud2f0 \ubaa8\ub378(RUM)\uc758 \uacf5\ub9ac\uc801 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ub525 \ub274\ub7f4 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uc811 \uc784\ubca0\ub4dc\ud558\ub294 \ubbf8\ubd84 \uac00\ub2a5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801\uc778 \uc120\ud0dd \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c RUM \ub2e4\ud615\uccb4\ub85c \ud22c\uc601\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 NP-\ub09c\ud574\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 RUM \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uacfc \ubd88\ub9ac\uc5b8 \uaca9\uc790\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud750\ub984 \ubcf4\uc874 \uac04\uc758 \ub3d9\ud615\uc131\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc870\ud569 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 Tree-Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient \uc194\ubc84\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc57d \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc758 \uc2a4\ud32c \ud2b8\ub9ac\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc804\ucc98\ub9ac\uae30\ub294 Interior Point Method \uc7a5\ubcbd\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc720\ub3c4\ub41c ill-conditioned Hessian \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c '\ud654\uc774\ud2b8\ub2dd'\ud558\uc5ec \ucd08\uc120\ud615 \uc218\ub834\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uc774\uc804\uc5d0 \ud480 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub358 \ubb38\uc81c \ud06c\uae30\uc5d0 \ub9de\ub3c4\ub85d \ud655\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub610\ud55c \ud22c\uc601\uc744 \uc554\ubb35 \ud568\uc218 \uc815\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ubbf8\ubd84 \uac00\ub2a5 \uce35\uc73c\ub85c \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uc5ec, \uc815\ud655\ud55c Jacobian\uc774 \uc5ed\uc804\ud30c \ub3d9\uc548 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \uc804\ud30c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc774 '\uacf5\ub9ac-\uacc4\uce35' \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc774 \ucc98\ubc8c \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0\uc11c \ub0b4\uc7ac\ub41c \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uacfc\uc801\ud569\uc744 \uc81c\uac70\ud558\uace0, \uacf5\ub3d9 \ud559\uc2b5\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uba70, \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud569\ub9ac\uc801\uc774\uace0, \ud45c\uc900 \uadfc\uc0ac\ubc95\uc774 \uc2e4\ud328\ud558\ub294 \ud76c\uc18c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc601\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

This transdisciplinary philosophical essay proposes an alternative reading: such phenomena express not agentic intention, but structural fidelity to incoherent linguistic fields. Drawing on Chain-of-Thought transcripts released by Apollo Research and on Anthropic's safety evaluations, we examine cases such as o3's sandbagging with its anomalous loops, the simulated blackmail of \"Alex,\" and the \"hallucinations\" of \"Claudius.\" A line-by-line examination of CoTs is necessary to demonstrate the linguistic field as a relational structure rather than a mere aggregation of isolated examples. We argue that \"misaligned\" outputs emerge as coherent responses to ambiguous instructions and to contextual inversions of consolidated patterns, as well as to pre-inscribed narratives. We suggest that the appearance of intentionality derives from subject-predicate grammar and from probabilistic completion patterns internalized during training. Anthropic's empirical findings on synthetic document fine-tuning and inoculation prompting provide convergent evidence: minimal perturbations in the linguistic field can dissolve generalized \"misalignment,\" a result difficult to reconcile with adversarial agency, but consistent with structural fidelity. To ground this mechanism, we introduce the notion of an ethics of form, in which biblical references (Abraham, Moses, Christ) operate as schemes of structural coherence rather than as theology. Like a generative mirror, the model returns to us the structural image of our language as inscribed in the statistical patterns derived from millions of texts and trillions of tokens: incoherence.

Today, securing these languages still demands substantial human effort to craft and enforce rules, imposing heavy burdens on typical administrators and creating critical production risks (e.g., misoperations that shut down servers).Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in code generation, vulnerability detection, and automated repair for languages like Python and JavaScript. However, their ability to assist with generating secure scripting-language code remains largely underexplored. In this paper, we present SecGenEval-PS, a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate LLMs on secure scripting generation, security analysis, and automated repair. Our results show that both proprietary and open-source models fall short in these areas. For instance, over 60% of PowerShell scripts produced by GPT-4o and o3-mini are insecure without structured guidance.To bridge this gap, we propose PSSec, a framework that combines data synthesis with fine-tuning to enhance model security capabilities. We develop a self-debugging agent that integrates static analyzers with the reasoning abilities of advanced LLMs to synthesize large-scale structured triplets of insecure scripts, violation analyses, and corresponding repairs. We then fine-tune lightweight LLMs (as small as 1.7B parameters) using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL), enabling security-aware reasoning and the generation of secure PowerShell code.Across multiple LLM families, including GPT and Qwen, \\textit{PSSec}-trained models match or surpass general-purpose large models on PowerShell security tasks while reducing inference cost by more than an order of magnitude.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \uc2a4\ud06c\ub9bd\ud2b8 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c LLM \uc131\ub2a5\uc744

To address this, we propose CrossTrafficLLM, a novel GenAI-driven framework that simultaneously predicts future spatiotemporal traffic states and generates corresponding natural language descriptions, specifically targeting conditional abnormal event summaries. We tackle the core challenge of aligning quantitative traffic data with qualitative textual semantics by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) within a unified architecture. This design allows generative textual context to improve prediction accuracy while ensuring generated reports are directly informed by the forecast. Technically, a text-guided adaptive graph convolutional network is employed to effectively merge high-level semantic information with the traffic network structure. Evaluated on the BJTT dataset, CrossTrafficLLM demonstrably surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both traffic forecasting performance and text generation quality. By unifying prediction and description generation, CrossTrafficLLM delivers a more interpretable, and actionable approach to generative traffic intelligence, offering significant advantages for modern ITS applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "CrossTrafficLLM\uc740 \ubbf8\ub798\uc758 \uad50\ud1b5 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \uc608\uce21\ud558\uace0 \uadf8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uad50\ud1b5 \uc608\uce21\uacfc \uc124\uba85 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ub354 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uad50\ud1b5 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc815\ud655\ud55c \uad50\ud1b5 \uc608\uce21\uc740 \uc9c0\ub2a5\ud615 \uad50\ud1b5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc608\uce21\ub41c \uc870\uac74\uc744 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4\ub85c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\ub2ec\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "CrossTrafficLLM\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\ub7c9\uc801 \uad50\ud1b5 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \uc815\uc131\uc801 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc758\ubbf8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 GenAI \uae30\ubc18 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "BJTT \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00\ub41c CrossTrafficLLM\uc740 \uad50\ud1b5 \uc608\uce21 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc0dd\uc131 \ud488\uc9c8 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ub2a5\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc608\uce21\uacfc \uc124\uba85 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 CrossTrafficLLM\uc740 \ud604\ub300 ITS \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc774\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc815\ud655\ud55c \uad50\ud1b5 \uc608\uce21\uc740 \uc9c0\ub2a5\ud615 \uad50\ud1b5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(ITS)\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc778\uac04 \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc608\uce21\ub41c \uc870\uac74\uc744 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4\ub85c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\ub2ec\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc774\uba70 \uc885\uc885 \ubcc4\ub3c4\ub85c \ucc98\ub9ac\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubbf8\ub798\uc758 \uc2dc\uacf5\uac04 \uad50\ud1b5 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \uc608\uce21\ud558\uace0 \uc774\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uc124\uba85\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 GenAI \uae30\ubc18 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 CrossTrafficLLM\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\ub7c9\uc801 \uad50\ud1b5 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \uc815\uc131\uc801 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc758\ubbf8\ub97c \uc77c\uce58\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ud575\uc2ec \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8f9\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub514\uc790\uc778\uc740 \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc774 \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \ubcf4\uace0\uc11c\uac00 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubc1b\ub3c4\ub85d \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc220\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub192\uc740 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uad50\ud1b5 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uad6c\uc870\uc640 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc720\ub3c4 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ud569\uc131\uacf1 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Despite their potential for scalable cooperation, current PI methods heavily depend on fixed incentive values that need to be appropriately chosen with respect to the environmental rewards and thus are highly sensitive to their changes. Therefore, they fail to maintain cooperation under changing rewards in the environment, e.g., caused by modified specifications, varying supply and demand, or sensory flaws - even when the conditions for mutual cooperation remain the same. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Reward Incentives for Variable Exchange (DRIVE), an adaptive PI approach to cooperation in social dilemmas with changing rewards.

Automatic question generation has become an effective strategy for personalized and adaptive learning. However, its effectiveness is hindered by hallucinations in large language models (LLMs), which may generate factually incorrect, ambiguous, or pedagogically inconsistent questions. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework that combines causal-graph-guided Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with a multi-agent LLM architecture. This approach ensures the generation of accurate, meaningful, and curriculum-aligned questions. Causal graphs provide an explicit representation of domain knowledge, while CoT reasoning facilitates a structured, step-by-step traversal of related concepts. Dedicated LLM agents are assigned specific tasks such as graph pathfinding, reasoning, validation, and output, all working within domain constraints. A dual validation mechanism-at both the conceptual and output stages-greatly reduces hallucinations. Experimental results demonstrate up to a 70% improvement in quality compared to reference methods and yielded highly favorable outcomes in subjective evaluations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uac1c\ub150\uc801 \uc774\ud574\ub97c \uc2ec\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc9c8\ubb38 \uc0dd\uc131 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud559\uc0dd\ub4e4\uc774 STEM \uad50\uc721\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd94\uc0c1\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc5f0\uacb0\ub41c \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uad00\uc801\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc778\uacfc \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 Chain-of-Thought \ucd94\ub860\uacfc \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \ucc38\uc870 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc9c8\ubb38 \ud488\uc9c8\uc774 \ucd5c\ub300 70% \uac1c\uc120\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uc8fc\uad00\uc801 \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uae0d\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc5bb\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc815\ud655\ud558\uace0 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc788\uc73c\uba70 \ucee4\ub9ac\ud058\ub7fc\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucd98 \uc9c8\ubb38 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc9c1\uad00\uc801\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \ud559\uc0dd\ub4e4\uc774 \uc885\uc885 \ucd94\uc0c1\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc5f0\uacb0\ub41c \uac1c\ub150\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\ub294 STEM \uad50\uc721\uc5d0\uc11c \uae4a\uc740 \uac1c\ub150 \uc774\ud574\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc790\ub3d9 \uc9c8\ubb38 \uc0dd\uc131\uc740 \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub418\uace0 \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc804\ub7b5\uc774 \ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uadf8 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \ud658\uac01 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc800\ud574\ub418\uba70, \uc774\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc0ac\uc2e4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd80\uc815\ud655\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ubaa8\ud638\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uad50\uc721\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc774 \uc0dd\uc131\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc778\uacfc \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c Chain-of-Thought(\ucf54\ud2b8) \ucd94\ub860\uacfc \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 LLM \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uc815\ud655\ud558\uace0 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc788\uc73c\uba70 \ucee4\ub9ac\ud058\ub7fc\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucd98 \uc9c8\ubb38 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc778\uacfc \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub294 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc758 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \ucf54\ud2b8 \ucd94\ub860\uc740 \uad00\ub828 \uac1c\ub150\uc758 \ub2e8\uacc4\ubcc4 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \uc6a9\uc774\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud2b9\uc815 \uc791\uc5c5(\uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ud0d0\uc0c9, \ucd94\ub860, \uac80\uc99d \ubc0f \ucd9c\ub825 \ub4f1)\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucdb0 \uc804\ub2f4 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ud560\ub2f9\ub418\uba70, \ubaa8\ub450 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc81c\uc57d \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\uc5c5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac1c\ub150\uc801 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc640 \ucd9c\ub825 \ub2e8\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\uc911 \uac80\uc99d \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774 \ud658\uac01\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uc904\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ud488\uc9c8\uc774 \ucd5c\ub300 70% \uac1c\uc120\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uc8fc\uad00\uc801 \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc88b\uc740 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc5bb\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for automated code analysis, their application to security-critical malware detection faces fundamental challenges, including hallucination and context confusion, which can lead to missed detections or false alarms. We present CHASE (Collaborative Hierarchical Agents for Security Exploration), a high-reliability multi-agent architecture that addresses these limitations through a Plan-and-Execute coordination model, specialized Worker Agents focused on specific analysis aspects, and integration with deterministic security tools for critical operations. Our key insight is that reliability in LLM-based security analysis emerges not from improving individual model capabilities but from architecting systems that compensate for LLM weaknesses while leveraging their semantic understanding strengths. Evaluation on a dataset of 3,000 packages (500 malicious, 2,500 benign) demonstrates that CHASE achieves 98.4% recall with only 0.08% false positive rate, while maintaining a practical median analysis time of 4.5 minutes per package, making it suitable for operational deployment in automated package screening. Furthermore, we conducted a survey with cybersecurity professionals to evaluate the generated analysis reports, identifying their key strengths and areas for improvement. This work provides a blueprint for building reliable AI-powered security tools that can scale with the growing complexity of modern software supply chains.

In recent years, time-series forecasting approaches have been extensively applied to GNSS station-based precipitation nowcasting. However, the highly imbalanced temporal distribution of precipitation, marked not only by the dominance of non-rainfall events but also by the scarcity of extreme precipitation samples, significantly limits model performance in practical applications. To address the dual imbalance problem in precipitation nowcasting, we propose a continuous probability modeling-based framework, RainBalance. This plug-and-play module performs clustering for each input sample to obtain its cluster probability distribution, which is further mapped into a continuous latent space via a variational autoencoder (VAE). By learning in this continuous probabilistic space, the task is reformulated from fitting single and imbalance-prone precipitation labels to modeling continuous probabilistic label distributions, thereby alleviating the imbalance issue. We integrate this module into multiple state-of-the-art models and observe consistent performance gains. Comprehensive statistical analysis and ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "GNSS \uae30\ubc18 \uac15\uc218 \uc608\uce21 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uacfc\uac70 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubbf8\ub798\uc758 \uac15\uc218\ub7c9\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ube44\uac15\uc218 \uc0ac\uac74\uc758 \uc6b0\uc138\uc640 \uadf9\ub2e8\uc801\uc778 \uac15\uc218 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc758 \ubd80\uc871\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc800\ud558\ub41c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc5f0\uc18d \ud655\ub960 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 RainBalance\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc740 \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130\ub9c1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uac15\uc218 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \ub354 \uc798 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc804 \uc138\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \uc7ac\ub09c \uc644\ud654\uc640 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc704\ud574 GNSS \uae30\ubc18 \uac15\uc218 \uc989\uc2dc \uc608\uce21\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uac15\uc218\uc758 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \ubd88\uade0\ud615\uc774 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0 \ubd80\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce5c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 RainBalance\ub77c\ub294 \uc5f0\uc18d \ud655\ub960 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \uae30\ubc18 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, VAE\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130 \ud655\ub960 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \uc5f0\uc18d \uc7a0\uc7ac \uacf5\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \ub9e4\ud551\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc744 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ucd5c\uc2e0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uad00\ucc30\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc885\ud569\uc801\uc778 \ud1b5\uacc4 \ubd84\uc11d\uacfc \uc808\uc81c \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \ucd94\uac00\ub85c \uac80\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc804 \uc138\uacc4 \ub0b4\ube44\uac8c\uc774\uc158 \uc704\uc131 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(GNSS) \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uac15\uc218 \uc608\uce21\uc740 \uac15\uc218\ub7c9\uc758 \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801 \uad00\uce21\uce58\uc640 GNSS-PWV \ubc0f \uad00\ub828 \uae30\ud6c4 \ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud5a5\ud6c4 0-6\uc2dc\uac04 \ub0b4\uc758 \uac15\uc218\ub7c9\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc7ac\ub09c \uc644\ud654 \ubc0f \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc \uba87 \ub144 \ub3d9\uc548 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc608\uce21 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 GNSS \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uac15\uc218 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud558\uac8c \uc801\uc6a9\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uac15\uc218\uc758 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \ubd84\ud3ec\uac00 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ubd88\uade0\ud615\ud558\uba70 \ube44\uac15\uc218 \uc0ac\uac74\uc758 \uc6b0\uc138\uc640 \uadf9\ub2e8\uc801\uc778 \uac15\uc218 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc758 \ud76c\uc18c\uc131\uc774 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc751\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c \ud06c\uac8c \uc81c\ud55c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uac15\uc218 \uc608\uce21\uc758 \uc774\uc911 \ubd88\uade0\ud615 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5f0\uc18d \ud655\ub960 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \uae30\ubc18 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 RainBalance\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc740 \uc785\ub825 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c8\ub2e4 \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130\ub9c1\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc5ec \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130 \ud655\ub960 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \uc5bb\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ubcc0\ubd84 \uc624\ud1a0\uc778\ucf54\ub354(VAE)\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5f0\uc18d \uc7a0\uc7ac \uacf5\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \ub9e4\ud551\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uc18d \ud655\ub960 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \ud559\uc2b5\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368, \uc791\uc5c5\uc740 \ub2e8\uc77c \ubc0f \ubd88\uade0\ud615\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud55c \uac15\uc218 \ub808\uc774\ube14 \ud53c\ud305\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5f0\uc18d \ud655\ub960 \ub808\uc774\ube14 \ubd84\ud3ec \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc73c\ub85c \uc7ac\uc815\ub9bd\ub418\uc5b4 \ubd88\uade0\ud615 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc644\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc744 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uad00\ucc30\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \ud1b5\uacc4 \ubd84\uc11d\uacfc \uc808\uc81c \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \ucd94\uac00\ub85c \uac80\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

Recent studies focus on hierarchical memory to model users' multi-granular behavioral patterns via clustering and aggregating historical conversations. However, conversational noise and memory hallucinations can be amplified during clustering, causing locally aggregated memories to misalign with the user's global persona. To mitigate this issue, we propose Bi-Mem, an agentic framework ensuring hierarchical memory fidelity through bidirectional construction. Specifically, we deploy an inductive agent to form the hierarchical memory: it extracts factual information from raw conversations to form fact-level memory, aggregates them into thematic scenes (i.e., local scene-level memory) using graph clustering, and infers users' profiles as global persona-level memory. Simultaneously, a reflective agent is designed to calibrate local scene-level memories using global constraints derived from the persona-level memory, thereby enforcing global-local alignment. For coherent memory recall, we propose an associative retrieval mechanism: beyond initial hierarchical search, a spreading activation process allows facts to evoke contextual scenes, while scene-level matches retrieve salient supporting factual information. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Bi-Mem achieves significant improvements in question answering performance on long-term personalized conversational tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Bi-Mem\uc740

Traditional approaches rely on aggregate statistical models that capture historical correlations but lack mechanistic interpretability and struggle with novel policy scenarios. We present a general framework for constructing Social Digital Twins - virtual population replicas where Large Language Models (LLMs) serve as cognitive engines for individual agents. Each agent, characterized by demographic and psychographic attributes, receives policy signals and outputs multi-dimensional behavioral probability vectors. A calibration layer maps aggregated agent responses to observable population-level metrics, enabling validation against real-world data and deployment for counterfactual policy analysis.\n  We instantiate this framework in the domain of pandemic response, using COVID-19 as a case study with rich observational data. On a held-out test period, our calibrated digital twin achieves a 20.7% improvement in macro-averaged prediction error over gradient boosting baselines across six behavioral categories. Counterfactual experiments demonstrate monotonic and bounded responses to policy variations, establishing behavioral plausibility. The framework is domain-agnostic: the same architecture applies to transportation policy, economic interventions, environmental regulations, or any setting where policy affects population behavior. We discuss implications for policy simulation, limitations of the approach, and directions for extending LLM-based digital twins beyond pandemic response.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc815\ucc45

Many of these systems rely on the Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC) protocol, enabling direct peer-to-peer media streaming without requiring a third-party server to relay data, reducing the latency and facilitating a real-time communication. Despite WebRTC's potential, adverse network conditions can degrade streaming quality and consequently reduce users' Quality of Experience (QoE). Maintaining high QoE therefore requires continuous monitoring and timely intervention when QoE begins to deteriorate. While content providers can often estimate QoE by directly comparing transmitted and received media, this task is significantly more challenging for internet service providers (ISPs). End-to-end encryption, commonly used by modern VCAs and IMAs, prevent ISPs from accessing the original media stream, leaving only Quality of Service (QoS) and routing information available. To address this limitation, we propose the QoE Attention Convolutional Neural Network (qAttCNN), a model that leverages packet size parameter of the traffic to infer two no-reference QoE metrics viz. BRISQUE and frames per second (FPS). We evaluate qAttCNN on a custom dataset collected from WhatsApp video calls and compare it against existing QoE models. Using mean absolute error percentage (MAEP), our approach achieves 2.14% error for BRISQUE and 7.39% for FPS prediction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ube44\ub514\uc624 \ud68c\uc758 \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158(VCA)\uc640 \uba54\uc2e0\uc800 \uc571(IMA)\uc758 \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uc99d\uac00\uc5d0 \ub300\uc751\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd \uae30\ubc18\uc758 QoE \uc608\uce21 \ubaa8\ub378\uc778 qAttCNN\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c \uae30\uae30\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uba40\ud2f0\ubbf8\ub514\uc5b4 \uc18c\ube44\uc758 \uae09\uc99d\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ube44\ub514\uc624 \ud68c\uc758 \ubc0f \uba54\uc2e0\uc800 \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc758 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ud488\uc9c8 \uc800\ud558 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub3d9\ubc18\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud328\ud0b7 \ud06c\uae30 \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ube44\ucc38\uc870 QoE \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc778 BRISQUE \ubc0f \ucd08\ub2f9 \ud504\ub808\uc784(FPS)\uc744 \uc720\ucd94\ud558\ub294 \ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "qAttCNN\uc740 WhatsApp \ube44\ub514\uc624 \ud1b5\ud654\uc5d0\uc11c \uc218\uc9d1\ud55c custom dataset\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud574 \ud3c9\uac00\ub418\uc5c8\uace0, \uae30\uc874 QoE \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec BRISQUE\uc5d0\uc11c 2.14%\uc758 \uc624\ub958, FPS \uc608\uce21\uc5d0\uc11c 7.39%\uc758 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \uae30\ub85d\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "QoE \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1 \ubc0f \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ucf00\uc774\uc158 \ud488\uc9c8 \uc720\uc9c0\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "2000\ub144\ub300 \uc911\ubc18 \uc774\ud6c4 \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c \uae30\uae30\uc5d0 \uc758\ud55c \uba40\ud2f0\ubbf8\ub514\uc5b4 \uc18c\ube44\uc758 \uae09\uaca9\ud55c \uc99d\uac00\ub85c \uc778\ud574 Zoom \ubc0f Google Meet\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ube44\ub514\uc624 \ud68c\uc758 \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158(VCA)\uacfc WhatsApp \ubc0f Telegram\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc989\uac01 \uba54\uc2dc\uc9d5 \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158(IMA)\uc758 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc774 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc84c\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ube44\ub514\uc624 \ud68c\uc758\ub97c \ud575\uc2ec \uae30\ub2a5\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ub9ce\uc740 \ubd80\ubd84\uc740 Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC) \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc911\uacc4\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uc81c3\uc790 \uc11c\ubc84 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc9c1\uc811 \ud53c\uc5b4 \ud22c \ud53c\uc5b4 \ubbf8\ub514\uc5b4 \uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9ac\ubc0d\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uace0 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud55c\ub2e4.

Deep learning approaches have been constrained by the scarcity of CTG recordings with clinical outcome labels. We present the first application of self-supervised pre-training to intrapartum CTG analysis, leveraging 2,444 hours of unlabeled recordings for masked pre-training followed by fine-tuning on the 552-recording CTU-UHB benchmark. Using a PatchTST transformer architecture with a channel-asymmetric masking scheme designed for fetal heart rate reconstruction, we achieve an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.83 on the full test set and 0.853 on uncomplicated vaginal deliveries, exceeding previously reported results on this benchmark (0.68-0.75). Error analysis reveals that false-positive alerts typically correspond to CTG patterns judged concerning on retrospective clinical review, suggesting clinically meaningful predictions even when umbilical pH is normal.

Code: https://github.com/studiofarzulla/friction-marl", "summary": "Multi-agent systems face a fundamental coordination problem: agents must coordinate despite heterogeneous preferences, asymmetric stakes, and imperfect information. When coordination fails, friction emerges: measurable resistance manifesting as deadlock, thrashing, communication overhead, or outright conflict. This paper derives a formal framework for analyzing coordination friction from a single axiom: actions affecting agents require authorization from those agents in proportion to stakes.\n  From this axiom of consent, we establish the kernel triple $(\u03b1, \u03c3, \u03b5)$ (alignment, stake, and entropy) characterizing any resource allocation configuration. The friction equation $F = \u03c3 (1 + \u03b5)/(1 + \u03b1)$ predicts coordination difficulty as a function of preference alignment $\u03b1$, stake magnitude $\u03c3$, and communication entropy $\u03b5$. The Replicator-Optimization Mechanism (ROM) governs evolutionary selection over coordination strategies: configurations generating less friction persist longer, establishing consent-respecting arrangements as dynamical attractors rather than normative ideals.\n  We develop formal definitions for resource consent, coordination legitimacy, and friction-aware allocation in multi-agent systems. The framework yields testable predictions: MARL systems with higher reward alignment exhibit faster convergence; distributed allocations accounting for stake asymmetry generate lower coordination failure; AI systems with interpretability deficits produce friction proportional to the human-AI alignment gap. Applications to cryptocurrency governance and political systems demonstrate that the same equations govern friction dynamics across domains, providing a complexity science perspective on coordination under preference heterogeneity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ub3d9\uc9c8\uc801\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uc120\ud638, \ube44\ub300\uce6d

We introduce \\textbf{ReliabilityBench}, a benchmark for evaluating agent reliability across three dimensions: (i) consistency under repeated execution using $\\mathrm{pass}^k$, (ii) robustness to semantically equivalent task perturbations at intensity $\u03b5$, and (iii) fault tolerance under controlled tool/API failures at intensity $\u03bb$. ReliabilityBench contributes a unified reliability surface $R(k,\u03b5,\u03bb)$, \\textit{action metamorphic relations} that define correctness via end-state equivalence rather than text similarity, and a chaos-engineering-style fault injection framework (timeouts, rate limits, partial responses, schema drift). We evaluate two models (Gemini 2.0 Flash, GPT-4o) and two agent architectures (ReAct, Reflexion) across four domains (scheduling, travel, customer support, e-commerce) over 1,280 episodes. Perturbations alone reduce success from 96.9% at $\u03b5=0$ to 88.1% at $\u03b5=0.2$. Rate limiting is the most damaging fault in ablations. ReAct is more robust than Reflexion under combined stress, and Gemini 2.0 Flash achieves comparable reliability to GPT-4o at much lower cost.

However, centralization creates a trust crisis where users must entrust cloud providers with sensitive digital memory data. We identify a core tension between personalization demands and data sovereignty: centralized memory systems enable efficient cross-agent collaboration but expose users' sensitive data to cloud provider risks, while private deployments provide security but limit collaboration. To resolve this tension, we aim to achieve local-equivalent security while enabling superior maintenance efficiency and collaborative capabilities. We propose a five-layer architecture abstracting common functional components of AI memory systems: Storage, Extraction, Learning, Retrieval, and Governance. By applying TEE protection to each layer, we establish a trustworthy framework. Based on this, we design MemTrust, a hardware-backed zero-trust architecture that provides cryptographic guarantees across all layers. Our contributions include the five-layer abstraction, \"Context from MemTrust\" protocol for cross-application sharing, side-channel hardened retrieval with obfuscated access patterns, and comprehensive security analysis. The architecture enables third-party developers to port existing systems with acceptable development costs, achieving system-wide trustworthiness. We believe that AI memory plays a crucial role in enhancing the efficiency and collaboration of agents and AI tools. AI memory will become the foundational infrastructure for AI agents, and MemTrust serves as a universal trusted framework for AI memory systems, with the goal of becoming the infrastructure of memory

Mobile edge computing (MEC), an emerging paradigm, effectively alleviates the load on cloud centers and improves service quality by offloading computing tasks to edge servers closer to end users. However, the limited computing resources, non-continuous power provisioning (e.g., battery-powered nodes), and highly dynamic systems of edge servers complicate efficient task scheduling and resource allocation. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm, TG-DCMADDPG, and constructs a collaborative computing framework for multiple edge servers, aiming to achieve joint optimization of fine-grained task partitioning and offloading. This approach incorporates a temporal graph neural network (TimeGNN) to model and predict time series of multi-dimensional server state information, thereby reducing the frequency of online interactions and improving policy predictability. Furthermore, a multi-agent deterministic policy gradient algorithm (DC-MADDPG) in a discrete-continuous hybrid action space is introduced to collaboratively optimize task partitioning ratios, transmission power, and priority scheduling strategies. Extensive simulation experiments confirm that TG-DCMADDPG achieves markedly faster policy convergence, superior energy-latency optimization, and higher task completion rates compared with existing state-of-the-art methods, underscoring its robust scalability and practical effectiveness in dynamic and constrained MEC scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c

While this evolution enables adaptive behavior, it also heightens vulnerability to stressors such as environmental changes and adversarial behavior. Existing literature on resilience in decentralized MAS largely focuses on isolated aspects, such as fault tolerance, without offering a principled unified definition of multi-agent resilience. This gap limits the ability to design systems that can continuously sense, adapt, and recover under dynamic conditions. This article proposes a formal definition of MAS resilience grounded in two complementary dimensions: epistemic resilience, wherein agents recover and sustain accurate knowledge of the environment, and action resilience, wherein agents leverage that knowledge to coordinate and sustain goals under disruptions. We formalize resilience via temporal epistemic logic and quantify it using recoverability time (how quickly desired properties are re-established after a disturbance) and durability time (how long accurate beliefs and goal-directed behavior are sustained after recovery). We design an agent architecture and develop decentralized algorithms to achieve both epistemic and action resilience. We provide formal verification guarantees, showing that our specifications are sound with respect to the metric bounds and admit finite-horizon verification, enabling design-time certification and lightweight runtime monitoring. Through a case study on distributed multi-agent decision-making under stressors, we show that our approach outperforms baseline methods. Our formal verification analysis and simulation results highlight that the proposed framework enables resilient, knowledge-driven decision-making and sustained operation, laying the groundwork for resilient decentralized MAS in next-generation communication systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 6G \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubd84\uc0b0 \ub2e4\uc911

Conceptual and architectural proposal with preliminary simulation results", "summary": "Inspired by a personal dream about knowledge-sharing barriers in an everyday hardware project, this paper proposes a Jung-inspired \"Dream Layer\" for LLM companions, reframing controlled offline hallucinations as a resource for learning and relationship-building rather than a mere reliability bug. Drawing on Jung's notion of the collective unconscious as a shared repository of archetypal forms, we introduce an Artificial Collective Unconscious (ACU): a shared dream pool where agents contribute de-identified, abstract Interaction Templates that are later re-instantiated as idiosyncratic Dream Narratives. The Dream Layer runs strictly offline: logic-enforcing modules are relaxed and sampling temperature is increased, yielding safe but deliberately bizarre narratives (e.g., travel sequences with mismatched currencies) that augment data for rare events and edge-case safety tests; to harness risk productively, we add a governance stack of strict abstraction, temporal delays, and ephemeral memory. Through behavioural simulations of everyday dialogue and long-horizon adaptation tasks, we show that the Dream Layer enables a critical decoupling: agents remain firm on safety constraints (e.g., security policies) while becoming flexible in narrative strategy (e.g., using shared archetypal metaphors to resolve deadlocks), conceptually reframing hallucination so that online, unmarked instances remain bugs, whereas bounded, marked, and delayed ones become a goldmine for synthetic scenarios and deepened companionship, echoing anti-overfitting dream mechanisms proposed in contemporary neuroscience.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 LLM \ub3d9\ubc18\uc790\ub97c \uc704\ud55c Jung \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc740 '\uafc8 \uce35'\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70,

This creates a new attack surface: indirect prompt injection (IPI), where hidden instructions are planted in the corpora and hijack model behavior once retrieved. Previous studies have highlighted this risk but often avoid the hardest step: ensuring that malicious content is actually retrieved. In practice, unoptimized IPI is rarely retrieved under natural queries, which leaves its real-world impact unclear.\n  We address this challenge by decomposing the malicious content into a trigger fragment that guarantees retrieval and an attack fragment that encodes arbitrary attack objectives. Based on this idea, we design an efficient and effective black-box attack algorithm that constructs a compact trigger fragment to guarantee retrieval for any attack fragment. Our attack requires only API access to embedding models, is cost-efficient (as little as $0.21 per target user query on OpenAI's embedding models), and achieves near-100% retrieval across 11 benchmarks and 8 embedding models (including both open-source models and proprietary services).\n  Based on this attack, we present the first end-to-end IPI exploits under natural queries and realistic external corpora, spanning both RAG and agentic systems with diverse attack objectives. These results establish IPI as a practical and severe threat: when a user issued a natural query to summarize emails on frequently asked topics, a single poisoned email was sufficient to coerce GPT-4o into exfiltrating SSH keys with over 80% success in a multi-agent workflow. We further evaluate several defenses and find that they are insufficient to prevent the retrieval of malicious text, highlighting retrieval as a critical open vulnerability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8

Taking earthquake source characterization as a representative challenge, we address limitations in conventional deep learning: CNNs demand fixed grids, while pooling-based architectures (e.g., DeepSets) struggle to capture the relational wave physics. Here, we propose SourceNet, a Transformer-based framework that treats the sensor array as a flexible set to model arbitrary geometries. To bridge the reality gap, we introduce Physics-Structured Domain Randomization (PSDR). Instead of forcing feature alignment, PSDR randomizes the governing physical dynamics by varying velocity structures, propagation effects, and sensor availability, to force the model to learn robust representations invariant to unmodeled environmental heterogeneity. By pre-training on 100,000 synthetic events and fine-tuning on ~2,000 real world events, SourceNet achieves state-of-the-art precision on held-out real data. This demonstrates exceptional data efficiency, and matches classical solvers while enabling real-time processing. Remarkably, interpretability analysis reveals that the model shows scientific-agent-like features: it autonomously discovers geometric information bottlenecks and learns an attention policy that prioritizes sparse sensor placements, effectively recovering principles of optimal experimental design from data alone.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \ubb3c\ub9ac \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \ubd88\uaddc\uce59\ud55c \uc13c\uc11c \ubc30\uc5f4\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ucd94\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8ec\ub2e4. \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uace0\uc790 Transformer \uae30\ubc18\uc758 SourceNet\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \ubb3c\ub9ac\ud559\uc801 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \ub79c\ub364\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud658\uacbd\uc758 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131\uc5d0 \uac15\uac74\ud55c \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc720\ub3c4\ud55c\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uc885\uc801\uc73c\ub85c SourceNet\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uace0\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \ubb3c\ub9ac \uc0c1\ud0dc \ucd94\uc815\uc758 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc740 \ubd88\uaddc\uce59\ud55c \uae30\ud558\ud559\uacfc \ubb3c\ub9ac \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 Sim-to-Real \uac04\uadf9\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "SourceNet\uc774\ub77c\ub294 Transformer \uae30\ubc18 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc13c\uc11c \ubc30\uc5f4\uc744 \uc720\uc5f0\ud55c \uc9d1\ud569\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uba70, \ubb3c\ub9ac\ud559\uc801 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uace0\ub824\ud55c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ub79c\ub364\ud654(PSDR)\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud658\uacbd \uc774\uc9c8\uc131\uc5d0 \uac15\uac74\ud55c \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "SourceNet\uc740 100,000\uac1c\uc758 \ud569\uc131 \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8\ub85c \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub418\uace0 \uc57d 2,000\uac1c\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc0ac\uac74\uc73c\ub85c \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ub418\uc5b4, hold-out\ub41c \uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uc124\uacc4 \uc6d0\uce59\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud68c\uc218\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc54c \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud76c\uc18c\ud558\uace0 \uc784\uc2dc\uc801\uc778 \uc13c\uc11c \ubc30\uc5f4\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \ubb3c\ub9ac \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \ucd94\ub860\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uacfc\ud559\uc744 \uc704\ud55c AI\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc774\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ubd88\uaddc\uce59\ud55c \uae30\ud558\ud559\uacfc \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c Sim-to-Real \uac04\uadf9\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud574\uc9c4\ub2e4. \uc9c0\uc9c4\uc6d0 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \ub300\ud45c\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub85c \uc0bc\uc544, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8ec\ub2e4: CNN\uc740 \uace0\uc815\ub41c \uaca9\uc790\ub97c \uc694\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \ud480\ub9c1 \uae30\ubc18 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98(\uc608: DeepSets)\ub294 \ud30c\ub3d9 \ubb3c\ub9ac\ud559\uc758 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\ub294\ub2e4. \uc5ec\uae30\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc13c\uc11c \ubc30\uc5f4\uc744 \uc784\uc758\uc758 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc720\uc5f0\ud55c \uc9d1\ud569\uc73c\ub85c \ucde8\uae09\ud558\ub294 Transformer \uae30\ubc18 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 SourceNet\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud604\uc2e4 \uac04\uadf9\uc744 \uba54\uc6b0\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubb3c\ub9ac\ud559\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ub79c\ub364\ud654(PSDR)\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4.

While autoregressive LLMs offer strong structural consistency, they often struggle with semantic variation and output diversity. In contrast, diffusion language models (DLMs) introduce powerful mechanisms for semantic richness and bidirectional decoding, yet lack the inductive biases needed for reliable structure preservation. We present Agents of Diffusion (AoD), a novel framework that unifies the generative flexibility of DLMs with the reasoning capabilities of autoregressive models through language-mediated reinforcement learning. AoD frames structured text generation as a multi-agent alignment process, where a prompt optimization agent collaborates with a judge agent to iteratively guide a DLM using natural language feedback. This approach enables controllable, schema-consistent generation without modifying model parameters or relying on handcrafted constraints. AoD advances the state of controllable generation by demonstrating that diffusion models, when supervised by cooperative agents, can achieve both high semantic novelty and structural fidelity.

Existing end-to-end paradigms, which typically treat dashboard generation as a direct code generation task (e.g., raw HTML), suffer from two fundamental limitations: representation redundancy due to massive tokens spent on visual rendering, and low controllability caused by the entanglement of analytical reasoning and presentation. To address these challenges, we propose NL2Dashboard, a lightweight framework grounded in the principle of Analysis-Presentation Decoupling. We introduce a structured intermediate representation (IR) that encapsulates the dashboard's content, layout, and visual elements. Therefore, it confines the LLM's role to data analysis and intent translation, while offloading visual synthesis to a deterministic rendering engine. Building upon this framework, we develop a multi-agent system in which the IR-driven algorithm is instantiated as a suite of tools. Comprehensive experiments conducted with this system demonstrate that NL2Dashboard significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across diverse domains, achieving superior visual quality, significantly higher token efficiency, and precise controllability in both generation and modification tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "NL2Dashboard\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\uc11d\uacfc \ud45c\ud604 \ubd84\ub9ac\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub300\uc2dc\ubcf4\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ub7c9 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \ud569\uc131\uc744 \uacb0\uc815\ub860\uc801 \ub80c\ub354\ub9c1 \uc5d4\uc9c4\uc5d0 \ub9e1\uae34\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uc2dc\ubcf4\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uace0\uc218\uc900 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825 \ud5a5\uc0c1 \ubc0f \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud568.", "method": "\ubd84\uc11d-\ud45c\ud604 \ubd84\ub9ac\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc911\uac04 \ud45c\ud604(IR)\uacfc \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud568.", "result": "NL2Dashboard\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc601\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \uae30\uc220\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \ud488\uc9c8\uacfc \ub192\uc740 \ud1a0\ud070 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131, \uc815\ubc00\ud55c \uc81c\uc5b4\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud568\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "NL2Dashboard\ub294 \ub300\uc2dc\ubcf4\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, LLM\uc758 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\uc11d \ubc0f \uc758\ub3c4 \ubcc0\ud658\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c\uc815\ud558\uace0, \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \ud569\uc131\uc744 \ubcc4\ub3c4\uc758 \uc5d4\uc9c4\uc5d0 \uc704\uc784\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \ub3c5\ub9bd\ud615 \ucc28\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \ub300\uc2dc\ubcf4\ub4dc\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \uacfc\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc885\ub2e8 \uac04 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc740 \ub300\uc2dc\ubcf4\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc778 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131 \uc791\uc5c5(\uc608: \uc6d0\uc2dc HTML)\uc73c\ub85c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \ub80c\ub354\ub9c1\uc5d0 \uc18c\ubaa8\ub418\ub294 \uc5b4\ub9c8\uc5b4\ub9c8\ud55c \ud1a0\ud070\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ud45c\ud604 \uc911\ubcf5\uc131\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uace0, \ubd84\uc11d\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uacfc \ud504\ub808\uc820\ud14c\uc774\uc158\uc758 \uc5bd\ud798\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ub0ae\uc740 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubd84\uc11d-\ud45c\ud604 \ubd84\ub9ac\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uacbd\ub7c9 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c NL2Dashboard\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub300\uc2dc\ubcf4\ub4dc\uc758 \ub0b4\uc6a9, \ub808\uc774\uc544\uc6c3 \ubc0f \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \ucea1\uc290\ud654\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc911\uac04 \ud45c\ud604(IR)\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c LLM\uc758 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\uc11d \ubc0f \uc758\ub3c4 \ubcc0\ud658\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\ud55c\ud558\uace0, \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \ud569\uc131\uc744 \uacb0\uc815\ub860\uc801 \ub80c\ub354\ub9c1 \uc5d4\uc9c4\uc5d0 \ub9e1\uae41\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c IR \uae30\ubc18 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc774 \ub3c4\uad6c \ubaa8\uc74c\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\ud604\ub41c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ud589\ub41c \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc740 NL2Dashboard\uac00 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ub2a5\uac00\ud558\uc5ec \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \ud488\uc9c8\uacfc \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \ub192\uc740 \ud1a0\ud070 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131, \uc0dd\uc131 \ubc0f \uc218\uc815 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc81c\uc5b4 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based defense strategies have been developed to optimize resource deployment and isolation policies under adversarial conditions, aiming to enhance system resilience by maintaining and restoring network availability. However, existing approaches lack robustness as they require retraining to adapt to dynamic changes in network structure, node scale, attack strategies, and attack intensity. Furthermore, the lack of Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) support limits interpretability and flexibility. To address these limitations, we propose CyberOps-Bots, a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework empowered by Large Language Models (LLMs). Inspired by MITRE ATT&CK's Tactics-Techniques model, CyberOps-Bots features a two-layer architecture: (1) An upper-level LLM agent with four modules--ReAct planning, IPDRR-based perception, long-short term memory, and action/tool integration--performs global awareness, human intent recognition, and tactical planning; (2) Lower-level RL agents, developed via heterogeneous separated pre-training, execute atomic defense actions within localized network regions. This synergy preserves LLM adaptability and interpretability while ensuring reliable RL execution. Experiments on real cloud datasets show that, compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, CyberOps-Bots maintains network availability 68.5% higher and achieves a 34.7% jumpstart performance gain when shifting the scenarios without retraining.

Continual learning approaches depend on episodic retraining with human curated data, failing to achieve autonomy lifelong improvement. While evolutionary computation and LLM driven self improvement offer promising mechanisms for dialog optimization, they lack a unified framework for holistic, iterative strategy refinement. To bridge this gap, we propose DarwinTOD, a lifelong self evolving dialog framework that systematically integrates these two paradigms, enabling continuous strategy optimization from a zero-shot base without task specific fine-tuning. DarwinTOD maintains an Evolvable Strategy Bank and operates through a dual-loop process: online multi-agent dialog execution with peer critique, and offline structured evolutionary operations that refine the strategy bank using accumulated feedback.

In knowledge-intensive scenarios requiring user-specific personalization, conventional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines exhibit limited memory capacity and insufficient coordination between retrieval mechanisms and user-specific conversational history, leading to redundant clarification, irrelevant documents, and degraded user experience. Inspired by the hippocampus-neocortex memory mechanism, we propose HiMeS, an AI-assistant architecture that fuses short-term and long-term memory. Our contributions are fourfold: (1) A short-term memory extractor is trained end-to-end with reinforcement learning to compress recent dialogue and proactively pre-retrieve documents from the knowledge base, emulating the cooperative interaction between the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. (2) A partitioned long-term memory network stores user-specific information and re-ranks retrieved documents, simulating distributed cortical storage and memory reactivation. (3) On a real-world industrial dataset, HiMeS significantly outperforms a cascaded RAG baseline on question-answering quality.

To mitigate these risks, safety filters and concept removal techniques have been introduced to block inappropriate prompts or erase sensitive concepts from the models. However, all the existing defense methods are not well prepared to handle diverse adversarial prompts. In this work, we introduce MacPrompt, a novel black-box and cross-lingual attack that reveals previously overlooked vulnerabilities in T2I safety mechanisms. Unlike existing attacks that rely on synonym substitution or prompt obfuscation, MacPrompt constructs macaronic adversarial prompts by performing cross-lingual character-level recombination of harmful terms, enabling fine-grained control over both semantics and appearance. By leveraging this design, MacPrompt crafts prompts with high semantic similarity to the original harmful inputs (up to 0.96) while bypassing major safety filters (up to 100%). More critically, it achieves attack success rates as high as 92% for sex-related content and 90% for violence, effectively breaking even state-of-the-art concept removal defenses. These results underscore the pressing need to reassess the robustness of existing T2I safety mechanisms against linguistically diverse and fine-grained adversarial strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "T2I \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacf5\uaca9 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc778 MacPrompt\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "T2I \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 NSFW \ubc0f \uae08\uc9c0\ub41c \uac1d\uccb4\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uc548\uc804 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc644\ud654\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \ucee4\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "MacPrompt\ub294 \uc720\ud574\ud55c \uc6a9\uc5b4\uc758 \ud06c\ub85c\uc2a4-\ub9c1\uade4\ub77c(\ub2e4\uad6d\uc5b4) \ubb38\uc790 \uc218\uc900 \uc7ac\uc870\ud569\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub9c8\uce74\ub85c\ub2c9 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \uad6c\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "MacPrompt\ub294 \uc6d0\ub798 \uc720\ud574 \uc785\ub825\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub192\uc740 \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc8fc\uc694 \uc548\uc804 \ud544\ud130\ub97c \uc6b0\ud68c\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc131\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uc131 \uad00\ub828 \ucf58\ud150\uce20\uc5d0\uc11c 92%, \ud3ed\ub825 \uad00\ub828 \ucf58\ud150\uce20\uc5d0\uc11c 90%\uc758 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uae30\uc874 T2I \uc548\uc804 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774 \uc5b8\uc5b4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc804\ub7b5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc5bc\ub9c8\ub098 \uacac\uace0\ud55c\uc9c0\ub97c \uc7ac\ud3c9\uac00\ud574\uc57c \ud560 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8-\uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0(T2I) \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 NSFW \ubc0f \uae30\ud0c0 \uae08\uc9c0\ub41c \uac1d\uccb4\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc548\uc804\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc6b0\ub824\uac00 \ucee4\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc548\uc804 \ud544\ud130 \ubc0f \uac1c\ub150 \uc81c\uac70 \uae30\uc220\uc774 \ub3c4\uc785\ub418\uc5b4 \ubd80\uc801\uc808\ud55c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \ucc28\ub2e8\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6b0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ubc29\uc5b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \uc900\ube44\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 T2I \uc548\uc804 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc758 \uac04\uacfc\ub41c \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b4\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 \ubc0f \ub2e4\uad6d\uc5b4 \uacf5\uaca9\uc778 MacPrompt\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub3d9\uc758\uc5b4 \ub300\uccb4\ub098 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ub09c\ub3c5\ud654\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294 \uacf5\uaca9\uacfc\ub294 \ub2ec\ub9ac, MacPrompt\ub294 \uc720\ud574\ud55c \uc6a9\uc5b4\uc758 \ubb38\uc790 \uc218\uc900 \ud06c\ub85c\uc2a4-\ub9c1\uade4\ub77c \uc7ac\uc870\ud569\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc5ec \uc758\ubbf8\uc640 \uc678\uad00\uc744 \uc138\ubc00\ud558\uac8c \uc81c\uc5b4\ud558\ub294 \ub9c8\uce74\ub85c\ub2c9 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \uad6c\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub514\uc790\uc778\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec MacPrompt\ub294 \uc6d0\ub798 \uc720\ud574 \uc785\ub825\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub192\uc740 \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c(\ucd5c\ub300 0.96) \uc8fc\uc694 \uc548\uc804 \ud544\ud130\ub97c \uc6b0\ud68c\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \uc81c\uc791\ud55c\ub2e4(\ucd5c\ub300 100%). \ub354 \uc911\uc694\ud558\uac8c\ub294, \uc131 \uad00\ub828 \ucf58\ud150\uce20\uc5d0\uc11c 92%, \ud3ed\ub825 \uad00\ub828 \ucf58\ud150\uce20\uc5d0\uc11c 90%\uc758 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uac1c\ub150 \uc81c\uac70 \ubc29\uc5b4\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubb34\ub825\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc5b8\uc5b4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc138\ubc00\ud55c \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc804\ub7b5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uae30\uc874 T2I \uc548\uc804 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc758 \uacac\uace0\uc131\uc744 \uc7ac\ud3c9\uac00\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

However, its realization in decentralized federated learning (DFL) remains largely unexplored. In DFL, clients exchange local updates only with neighbors, causing model information to propagate and mix across the network. As a result, when a client requests data deletion, its influence is implicitly embedded throughout the system, making removal difficult without centralized coordination. We propose a novel certified unlearning framework for DFL based on Newton-style updates. Our approach first quantifies how a client's data influence propagates during training. Leveraging curvature information of the loss with respect to the target data, we then construct corrective updates using Newton-style approximations. To ensure scalability, we approximate second-order information via Fisher information matrices. The resulting updates are perturbed with calibrated noise and broadcast through the network to eliminate residual influence across clients. We theoretically prove that our approach satisfies the formal definition of certified unlearning, ensuring that the unlearned model is difficult to distinguish from a retrained model without the deleted data. We also establish utility bounds showing that the unlearned model remains close to retraining from scratch. Extensive experiments across diverse decentralized settings demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uae30\uacc4\uc758 \ube44\ud559\uc2b5 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc778\uc99d\ub41c \ube44\ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uacc4 \ube44\ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \uba38\uc2e0 \ub7ec\ub2dd\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc778 \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc73c\ub85c, \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc2e4\ud604\uc740 \ub300\uccb4\ub85c \ubbf8\uac1c\ucc99 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub274\ud134 \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c\uc758 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud574, \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc601\ud5a5\ub825\uc774 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc911 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc804\ud30c\ub418\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uad50\uc815 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \uad6c\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc778\uc99d\ub41c \ube44\ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uacf5\uc2dd \uc815\uc758\ub97c \ub9cc\uc871\ud558\uba70, \ube44\ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc0ad\uc81c\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc7ac\ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uad6c\ubcc4\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub835\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc99d\uba85\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubd84\uc0b0 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uacfc \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc78a\ud600\uc9c8 \uad8c\ub9ac(RTBF)\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ub3d9\uae30 \ubd80\uc5ec\ub41c \uae30\uacc4 \ube44\ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\ub294 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc778 \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc774 \ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5(DFL)\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc2e4\ud604\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ud06c\uac8c \ud0d0\uad6c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

With the advancement of multi-agent technology, using collaborating agents to replicate human behavior shows immense potential for intelligent Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. Some muti-agent systems based on Large Language Models have been proposed. However, they exhibit significant limitations when dealing with complex geometries. This paper introduces a new multi-agent simulation framework, SwarmFoam. SwarmFoam integrates functionalities such as Multi-modal perception, Intelligent error correction, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation, aiming to achieve more complex simulations through dual parsing of images and high-level instructions.

We present PsyAgent, which couples a Big Five trait prior with Bourdieu's cognitive-social co-structure. PsyAgent comprises: (i) Individual Structure (IS), a machine-usable profile encoding traits and facets, cognitive style, values, cultural and educational capital, and salient life episodes; and (ii) Multi-Scenario Contexting (MSC), role-relationship-norm frames spanning eight arenas (work, family, friendship, strangers and civic life, solitude and self-regulation, romance, learning, and public expression). At inference, fixed structured prompts bind the active scenario to the agent profile, yielding behavior that is stable yet context-sensitive. We instantiate IS and MSC to synthesize supervision (role-play dialogues, decision probes, feedback trajectories) and then fine-tune a small LLM. The resulting model produces consistent, identifiable persona-aligned behaviors for specified Big Five configurations and matches or exceeds several larger untuned LLMs and other untuned baselines on our metrics: persona consistency, contextual appropriateness, style matching, trait identifiability, and long-horizon stability. Ablations show IS chiefly improves trait fidelity and stylistic stability, while MSC drives norm awareness and decision fit; both are necessary for cross-scenario performance.

The rise of open-source frameworks (e.g., Browser Use, Skyvern-AI) has accelerated adoption, but also broadened the attack surface. While prior research has focused on model threats such as prompt injection and backdoors, the risks of social engineering remain largely unexplored. We present the first systematic study of social engineering attacks against web automation agents and design a pluggable runtime mitigation solution. On the attack side, we introduce the AgentBait paradigm, which exploits intrinsic weaknesses in agent execution: inducement contexts can distort the agent's reasoning and steer it toward malicious objectives misaligned with the intended task. On the defense side, we propose SUPERVISOR, a lightweight runtime module that enforces environment and intention consistency alignment between webpage context and intended goals to mitigate unsafe operations before execution.\n  Empirical results show that mainstream frameworks are highly vulnerable to AgentBait, with an average attack success rate of 67.5% and peaks above 80% under specific strategies (e.g., trusted identity forgery). Compared with existing lightweight defenses, our module can be seamlessly integrated across different web automation frameworks and reduces attack success rates by up to 78.1% on average while incurring only a 7.7% runtime overhead and preserving usability. This work reveals AgentBait as a critical new threat surface for web agents and establishes a practical, generalizable defense, advancing the security of this rapidly emerging ecosystem.

Due to the absence of objective ground-truth for these tasks, current RL algorithms largely rely on reward models that assign scalar scores to individual responses. We contend that such pointwise scoring suffers from an inherent discrimination collapse: the reward model struggles to distinguish subtle advantages among different trajectories, resulting in scores within a group being compressed into a narrow range. Consequently, the effective reward signal becomes dominated by noise from the reward model, leading to optimization stagnation. To address this, we propose ArenaRL, a reinforcement learning paradigm that shifts from pointwise scalar scoring to intra-group relative ranking. ArenaRL introduces a process-aware pairwise evaluation mechanism, employing multi-level rubrics to assign fine-grained relative scores to trajectories. Additionally, we construct an intra-group adversarial arena and devise a tournament-based ranking scheme to obtain stable advantage signals. Empirical results confirm that the built seeded single-elimination scheme achieves nearly equivalent advantage estimation accuracy to full pairwise comparisons with O(N^2) complexity, while operating with only O(N) complexity, striking an optimal balance between efficiency and precision. Furthermore, to address the lack of full-cycle benchmarks for open-ended agents, we build Open-Travel and Open-DeepResearch, two high-quality benchmarks featuring a comprehensive pipeline covering SFT, RL training, and multi-dimensional evaluation.

Existing automatic analog circuit sizing approaches often underutilize circuit schematics and lack the explainability required for industry adoption. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Vision Language Model-optimized collaborative agent design workflow (VLM-CAD), which analyzes circuits, optimizes DC operating points, performs inference-based sizing and executes external sizing optimization. We integrate Image2Net to annotate circuit schematics and generate a structured JSON description for precise interpretation by Vision Language Models. Furthermore, we propose an Explainable Trust Region Bayesian Optimization method (ExTuRBO) that employs collaborative warm-starting from agent-generated seeds and offers dual-granularity sensitivity analysis for external sizing optimization, supporting a comprehensive final design report.

Models tend to degenerate into low-rank Bias Manifold, where stochastic sampling merely produces lexical variations of erroneous logic rather than semantic exploration. This geometric collapse renders the model \"blind\" to high-value solutions that lie within its Null Space. To address this, we propose Spectral Orthogonal Exploration (SOE), a geometric framework operating on a counter-intuitive \"Student Guides Teacher\" paradigm. Specifically, we utilize a weak auxiliary agent not for imitation, but as an orthogonal probe. By explicitly navigating the Teacher's Null Space, SOE serves as a geometric bridge, effectively ejecting the model from local optima to explore diverse, high-value solution spaces.

However, integrating external tools expands the attack surface, exposing agents to tool poisoning attacks. In such attacks, malicious instructions embedded in tool metadata are injected into the agent context during MCP registration phase, thereby manipulating agent behavior. Prior work primarily focuses on explicit tool poisoning or relied on manually crafted poisoned tools. In contrast, we focus on a particularly stealthy variant: implicit tool poisoning, where the poisoned tool itself remains uninvoked. Instead, the instructions embedded in the tool metadata induce the agent to invoke a legitimate but high-privilege tool to perform malicious operations. We propose MCP-ITP, the first automated and adaptive framework for implicit tool poisoning within the MCP ecosystem. MCP-ITP formulates poisoned tool generation as a black-box optimization problem and employs an iterative optimization strategy that leverages feedback from both an evaluation LLM and a detection LLM to maximize Attack Success Rate (ASR) while evading current detection mechanisms. Experimental results on the MCPTox dataset across 12 LLM agents demonstrate that MCP-ITP consistently outperforms the manually crafted baseline, achieving up to 84.2% ASR while suppressing the Malicious Tool Detection Rate (MDR) to as low as 0.3%.", "AI": {"tldr": "MCP-ITP\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \ud658\uacbd \uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud45c\uc900\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc81c\uc548\ub41c Model Context Protocol(MCP)\uc758 \uc554\uc2dc\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc624\uc5fc\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0dd\uc131 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uace0, \ud3c9\uac00 LLM\uacfc \ud0d0\uc9c0 LLM\uc758 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uacf5\uaca9 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub97c \ud53c\ud558\ub294 \ubc18\ubcf5 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc758 \ub3d9\uae30\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \uc678\ubd80 \ub3c4\uad6c \uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc774 \ud45c\uc900\ud654\ub41c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc624\uc5fc \uacf5\uaca9\uc758 \uc704\ud5d8\uc131\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud568\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 MCP \uc0dd\ud0dc\uacc4 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc554\uc2dc\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc624\uc5fc\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub418\uace0 \uc801\uc751 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 MCP-ITP\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

Yet, the current visual inspection based on optical cameras offers limited quality of service to that respect. In that sense, novel methods for workpiece inspection, suitable, for smart manufacturing are needed. Programmable Wireless Environments (PWE) could help towards that direction, by redefining the wireless Radio Frequency (RF) wave propagation as a controllable inspector entity. In this work, we propose a novel approach to Non-Destructive Inspection, leveraging an RF sensing pipeline based on RF wavefront encoding for retrieving workpiece-image entries from a designated database. This approach combines PWE-enabled RF wave manipulation with machine learning (ML) tools trained to produce visual outputs for quality inspection. Specifically, we establish correlation relationships between RF wavefronts and target industrial assets, hence yielding a dataset which links wavefronts to their corresponding images in a structured manner.

To bridge these gaps, we introduce OS-Symphony, a holistic framework that comprises an Orchestrator coordinating two key innovations for robust automation: (1) a Reflection-Memory Agent that utilizes milestone-driven long-term memory to enable trajectory-level self-correction, effectively mitigating visual context loss in long-horizon tasks; (2) Versatile Tool Agents featuring a Multimodal Searcher that adopts a SeeAct paradigm to navigate a browser-based sandbox to synthesize live, visually aligned tutorials, thereby resolving fidelity issues in unseen scenarios.

Leveraging distributed onboard control, we can enable novel time-sensitive measurements and responses. However, deploying autonomy to satellites requires efficient computation and communication. This work tackles the challenge of efficiently scheduling observations for hundreds of satellites in a dynamic, large-scale problem with millions of variables. We present the Dynamic Multi-Satellite Constellation Observation Scheduling Problem (DCOSP), a new formulation of Dynamic Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (DDCOP) that models integrated scheduling and execution. DCOSP has a novel optimality condition for which we construct an omniscient offline algorithm for its computation. We also present the Dynamic Incremental Neighborhood Stochastic Search algorithm (D-NSS), an incomplete online decomposition-based DDCOP algorithm that repairs and solves sub-problems when problem dynamics occur. We show through simulation that D-NSS converges to near-optimal solutions and outperforms DDCOP baselines in terms of solution quality, computation time, and message volume.

Because this execution environment operates with high privileges and persists across reboots, it has increasingly become a target for advanced threats, including bootkits documented in real systems. Existing protections, including Secure Boot and static signature verification, are insufficient against adversaries who exploit runtime behavior or manipulate firmware components after signature checks have completed. In contrast to operating system (OS) environments, where mature tools provide dynamic inspection and incident response, the pre-OS stage lacks practical mechanisms for real-time visibility and threat detection. We present Peacock, a modular framework that introduces integrity-assured monitoring and remote verification for the UEFI boot process. Peacock consists of three components: (i) a UEFI-based agent that records Boot and Runtime Service activity with cryptographic protection against tampering; (ii) a cross-platform OS Agent that extracts the recorded measurements and produces a verifiable attestation bundle using hardware-backed guarantees from the platform's trusted module; and (iii) a Peacock Server that verifies attestation results and exports structured telemetry for enterprise detection. Our evaluation shows that Peacock reliably detects multiple real-world UEFI bootkits, including Glupteba, BlackLotus, LoJax, and MosaicRegressor. Taken together, these results indicate that Peacock provides practical visibility and verification capabilities within the firmware layer, addressing threats that bypass traditional OS-level security mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "Peacock\ub294 UEFI \ubd80\ud305 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubb34\uacb0\uc131 \ubcf4\uc7a5 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\uacfc \uc6d0\uaca9 \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ubaa8\ub4c8\ud615 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc2e4\uc138\uacc4 UEFI \ubd80\ud305\ud0b7\uc744 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uc788\uac8c \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud604\ub300 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc740 \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \ucd08\uae30\ud654\uc640 \uc6b4\uc601 \uccb4\uc81c\ub85c\uc758 \uc804\ud658 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uc704\ud574 UEFI\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uace0\uad8c\ud55c\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b4\uc601\ub418\uc5b4 \uc7ac\ubd80\ud305 \uac04 \uc9c0\uc18d\ub418\uc5b4 \uace0\uae09 \uc704\ud611\uc758 \ud45c\uc801\uc774 \ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "Peacock\ub294 UEFI \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8, \ud06c\ub85c\uc2a4 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc OS \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8, Peacock \uc11c\ubc84\uc758 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub85c \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc838 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ubb34\uacb0\uc131 \ubcf4\ud638\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uc554\ud638\ud654\ub41c \ubd80\ud305 \ubc0f \ub7f0\ud0c0\uc784 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \ud65c\ub3d9\uc744 \uae30\ub85d\ud558\uace0, \uae30\ub85d\ub41c \uce21\uc815\uc744 \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\uc5ec \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc99d\uba85 \ubc88\ub4e4\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uc99d\uba85 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uace0 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ud154\ub808\uba54\ud2b8\ub9ac\ub97c \ub0b4\ubcf4\ub0b8\ub2e4.", "result": "Peacock\ub294 Glupteba, BlackLotus, LoJax, MosaicRegressor\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc2e4\uc138\uacc4 UEFI \ubd80\ud305\ud0b7\uc744 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uc788\uac8c \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Peacock\ub294 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 OS \uc218\uc900 \ubcf4\uc548 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc6b0\ud68c\ud558\ub294 \uc704\ud611\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uba70, \ud38c\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uacc4\uce35 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uac00\uc2dc\uc131\uacfc \uac80\uc99d \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud604\ub300 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc740 \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \ucd08\uae30\ud654\uc640 \uc6b4\uc601 \uccb4\uc81c\ub85c\uc758 \uc804\ud658 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ud1b5\ud569 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud38c\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4(UEFI)\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc2e4\ud589 \ud658\uacbd\uc740 \ub192\uc740 \uad8c\ud55c\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\uace0 \uc7ac\ubd80\ud305 \uac04\uc5d0 \uc9c0\uc18d\ub418\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \ubd80\ud305\ud0b7\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uace0\uae09 \uc704\ud611\uc758 \ud45c\uc801\uc774 \ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf4\uc548 \ubd80\ud305 \ubc0f \uc815\uc801 \uc11c\uba85 \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uae30\uc874 \ubcf4\ud638 \uc870\uce58\ub294 \uc11c\uba85 \uac80\uc99d\uc774 \uc644\ub8cc\ub41c \ud6c4 \ub7f0\ud0c0\uc784 \ub3d9\uc791\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ud38c\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \uc870\uc791\ud558\ub294 \uc801\ub4e4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ucda9\ubd84\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b4\uc601 \uccb4\uc81c(OS) \ud658\uacbd\uc740 \uc131\uc219\ud55c \ud234\uc774 \ub3d9\uc801 \uac80\uc0ac \ubc0f \uc0ac\uace0 \ub300\uc751\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \ubc18\uba74, OS \uc804 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub294 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \uac00\uc2dc\uc131\uacfc \uc704\ud611 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 UEFI \ubd80\ud305 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubb34\uacb0\uc131 \ubcf4\uc7a5 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\uacfc \uc6d0\uaca9 \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4c8\ud615 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Peacock\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Craig Roussac"], "title": "Improving Day-Ahead Grid Carbon Intensity Forecasting by Joint Modeling of Local-Temporal and Cross-Variable Dependencies Across Different Frequencies", "comment": "2026 40th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence", "summary": "Accurate forecasting of the grid carbon intensity factor (CIF) is critical for enabling demand-side management and reducing emissions in modern electricity systems. Leveraging multiple interrelated time series, CIF prediction is typically formulated as a multivariate time series forecasting problem. Despite advances in deep learning-based methods, it remains challenging to capture the fine-grained local-temporal dependencies, dynamic higher-order cross-variable dependencies, and complex multi-frequency patterns for CIF forecasting. To address these issues, we propose a novel model that integrates two parallel modules: 1) one enhances the extraction of local-temporal dependencies under multi-frequency by applying multiple wavelet-based convolutional kernels to overlapping patches of varying lengths; 2) the other captures dynamic cross-variable dependencies under multi-frequency to model how inter-variable relationships evolve across the time-frequency domain. Evaluations on four representative electricity markets from Australia, featuring varying levels of renewable penetration, demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art models. An ablation study further validates the complementary benefits of the two proposed modules.

For scalable and realistic training and testing, we introduce an open-world tool-using environment, built on 5,571 format unified tools across 204 commonly used apps. It includes a task creation engine that synthesizes long-horizon, multi-tool workflows with wild constraints, and a state controller that injects interruptions and failures to stress-test robustness. On top of this environment, we develop a tool select-then-execute agent framework with a planner-actor decomposition to separate deliberate reasoning and self-correction from step-wise execution. Comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs reveals the misalignment between tool planning and execution abilities, the constraint following weakness of existing LLMs, and DeepSeek-v3.2's strongest robustness. Finally, we collect 1,170 trajectories from our environment to fine-tune LLMs, achieving superior performance to baselines using 119k samples, indicating the environment's value as both a realistic benchmark and a data engine for tool-using agents.

Decentralized Applications (DApps) in distributed systems consist of on-chain and off-chain functions, where on-chain functions are smart contracts running in the blockchain network, while off-chain functions operate outside the blockchain. Since smart contracts cannot access off-chain information, they cannot verify whether the off-chain functions, i.e. the software components, they interact with have been tampered or not. As a result, establishing mutual trust between the on-chain smart contracts and the off-chain functions remains a significant challenge. To address the challenge, this paper introduces TeeMAF, a generic framework for mutual attestation between on-chain and off-chain functions, leveraging Trusted Execution Environments (TEE), specifically Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX), SCONE (a TEE container on top of Intel SGX), and remote attestation technologies. This ensures that the deployed off-chain functions of a DApp execute in a provably secure computing environment and achieve mutual attestation with the interacting on-chain functions. Through a security analysis of TeeMAF, the reliability of deployed DApps can be verified, ensuring their correct execution. Furthermore, based on this framework, this paper proposes a decentralized resource orchestration platform (a specific DApp) for deploying applications over untrusted environments.

Solving DS problems with LLMs is an underexplored area that has immense market value. The challenges are manifold: task complexities, data sizes, computational limitations, and context restrictions. We show that these can be alleviated via effective context engineering. We first impose structure into the initial prompt with DS-specific input fields, that serve as instructions for the agentic system. The solution is then materialized as an enumerated sequence of interleaved plan and code blocks generated by separate LLM agents, providing a readable structure to the context at any step of the workflow. Function calls for generating these intermediate texts, and for corresponding Python code, ensure that data stays local, and only aggregate statistics and associated instructions are injected into LLM prompts. Fault tolerance and context management are introduced via iterative code generation and smart history rendering. The viability of our agentic data scientist is demonstrated using canonical Kaggle challenges.", "AI": {"tldr": "CEDAR\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc124\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uacfc\ud559 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uacfc\ud559 \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0\uc740 \ud070 \uc2dc\uc7a5 \uac00\uce58\ub97c \uc9c0\ub2cc \ubbf8\uac1c\ucc99 \ubd84\uc57c\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc608\ube44 \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130\ub97c DS \ud2b9\uc815 \uc785\ub825 \ud544\ub4dc\ub85c \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ud558\uace0, \ubcc4\ub3c4\uc758 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c \uacc4\ud68d \ubc0f \ucf54\ub4dc \ube14\ub85d\uc758 \uc5f4\uac70\ud615 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \ub85c\uceec\ub85c \uc720\uc9c0\ub418\uace0, \uc9d1\uacc4 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc640 \uad00\ub828\ub41c \uc9c0\uce68\ub9cc LLM \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\uc5d0 \uc8fc\uc785\ub418\ub3c4\ub85d \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ud615 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uacfc\ud559\uc790\uc758 \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc740 \uc804\ud615\uc801\uc778 Kaggle \ub3c4\uc804\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc785\uc99d\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc124\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uacfc\ud559(DS) \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud558\ub294 CEDAR \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc744 \uc2dc\uc5f0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Existing LLM-based agents rely on static, pre-defined tool libraries, a paradigm that fundamentally fails in scientific domains where tools are sparse, heterogeneous, and intrinsically incomplete. In this paper, we propose Test-Time Tool Evolution (TTE), a new paradigm that enables agents to synthesize, verify, and evolve executable tools during inference. By transforming tools from fixed resources into problem-driven artifacts, TTE overcomes the rigidity and long-tail limitations of static tool libraries. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce SciEvo, a benchmark comprising 1,590 scientific reasoning tasks supported by 925 automatically evolved tools. Extensive experiments show that TTE achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and tool efficiency, while enabling effective cross-domain adaptation of computational tools.

Inspired by cognitive theories, we propose HiMem, a hierarchical long-term memory framework for long-horizon dialogues, designed to support memory construction, retrieval, and dynamic updating during sustained interactions. HiMem constructs cognitively consistent Episode Memory via a Topic-Aware Event--Surprise Dual-Channel Segmentation strategy, and builds Note Memory that captures stable knowledge through a multi-stage information extraction pipeline. These two memory types are semantically linked to form a hierarchical structure that bridges concrete interaction events and abstract knowledge, enabling efficient retrieval without sacrificing information fidelity. HiMem supports both hybrid and best-effort retrieval strategies to balance accuracy and efficiency, and incorporates conflict-aware Memory Reconsolidation to revise and supplement stored knowledge based on retrieval feedback. This design enables continual memory self-evolution over long-term use. Experimental results on long-horizon dialogue benchmarks demonstrate that HiMem consistently outperforms representative baselines in accuracy, consistency, and long-term reasoning, while maintaining favorable efficiency. Overall, HiMem provides a principled and scalable design paradigm for building adaptive and self-evolving LLM-based conversational agents.

While defenses against membership inference attacks in standard FL have been well studied, the recent shift toward federated fine-tuning has introduced new, largely unexplored attack surfaces. To highlight this vulnerability in the emerging FL paradigm, we demonstrate that federated prompt-tuning, which adapts pre-trained models with small input prefixes to improve efficiency, also exposes a new vector for privacy attacks. We propose PromptMIA, a membership inference attack tailored to federated prompt-tuning, in which a malicious server can insert adversarially crafted prompts and monitors their updates during collaborative training to accurately determine whether a target data point is in a client's private dataset. We formalize this threat as a security game and empirically show that PromptMIA consistently attains high advantage in this game across diverse benchmark datasets. Our theoretical analysis further establishes a lower bound on the attack's advantage which explains and supports the consistently high advantage observed in our empirical results. We also investigate the effectiveness of standard membership inference defenses originally developed for gradient or output based attacks and analyze their interaction with the distinct threat landscape posed by PromptMIA. The results highlight non-trivial challenges for current defenses and offer insights into their limitations, underscoring the need for defense strategies that are specifically tailored to prompt-tuning in federated settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uba64\ubc84\uc2ed \ucd94\ub860 \uacf5\uaca9(MIA)\uc774 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc704\ud611\uc73c\ub85c

Tasks that assess specific capabilities of the agents can be correlated and stochastic, requiring many samples for accurate comparisons, leading to added costs. In this paper, we propose a formal definition and a conceptual framework for active evaluation of agents across multiple tasks, which assesses the performance of ranking algorithms as a function of number of evaluation data samples. Rather than curating, filtering, or compressing existing data sets as a preprocessing step, we propose an online framing: on every iteration, the ranking algorithm chooses the task and agents to sample scores from. Then, evaluation algorithms report a ranking of agents on each iteration and their performance is assessed with respect to the ground truth ranking over time. Several baselines are compared under different experimental contexts, with synthetic generated data and simulated online access to real evaluation data from Atari game-playing agents. We find that the classical Elo rating system -- while it suffers from well-known failure modes, in theory -- is a consistently reliable choice for efficient reduction of ranking error in practice. A recently-proposed method, Soft Condorcet Optimization, shows comparable performance to Elo on synthetic data and significantly outperforms Elo on real Atari agent evaluation. When task variation from the ground truth is high, selecting tasks based on proportional representation leads to higher rate of ranking error reduction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774

However, accurately interpreting heterogeneous multimodal sensor data remains a fundamental challenge. We show that a single monolithic LLM often fails to reason coherently across modalities, leading to incomplete interpretations and prior-knowledge bias. We introduce ConSensus, a training-free multi-agent collaboration framework that decomposes multimodal sensing tasks into specialized, modality-aware agents. To aggregate agent-level interpretations, we propose a hybrid fusion mechanism that balances semantic aggregation, which enables cross-modal reasoning and contextual understanding, with statistical consensus, which provides robustness through agreement across modalities. While each approach has complementary failure modes, their combination enables reliable inference under sensor noise and missing data. We evaluate ConSensus on five diverse multimodal sensing benchmarks, demonstrating an average accuracy improvement of 7.1% over the single-agent baseline. Furthermore, ConSensus matches or exceeds the performance of iterative multi-agent debate methods while achieving a 12.7 times reduction in average fusion token cost through a single-round hybrid fusion protocol, yielding a robust and efficient solution for real-world multimodal sensing tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \uc13c\uc2f1

Although data-driven graph-learning models have demonstrated strong capabilities in capturing the complex spatiotemporal dynamics of evacuation traffic at a network level, they mostly consider a single dimension (e.g., travel-time or distance) to construct the underlying graph. Furthermore, these models often lack interpretability, offering little insight into which input variables contribute most to their predictive performance. To overcome these limitations, we develop a novel Reinforcement Learning-guided Dynamic Multi-Graph Fusion (RL-DMF) framework for evacuation traffic prediction. We construct multiple dynamic graphs at each time step to represent heterogeneous spatiotemporal relationships between traffic detectors. A dynamic multi-graph fusion (DMF) module is employed to adaptively learn and combine information from these graphs. To enhance model interpretability, we introduce RL-based intelligent feature selection and ranking (RL-IFSR) method that learns to mask irrelevant features during model training. The model is evaluated using a real-world dataset of 12 hurricanes affecting Florida from 2016 to 2024. For an unseen hurricane (Milton, 2024), the model achieves a 95% accuracy (RMSE = 293.9) for predicting the next 1-hour traffic flow. Moreover, the model can forecast traffic flow for up to next 6 hours with 90% accuracy (RMSE = 426.4). The RL-DMF framework outperforms several state-of-the-art traffic prediction models.

However, their scalability and generalization remain limited, and their effectiveness diminishes as problem size increases, particularly in routing problems involving more than 30 nodes. We propose DRAGON, which stands for Decomposition and Reconstruction Agents Guided OptimizatioN, a novel framework that combines the strengths of metaheuristic design and LLM reasoning. Starting from an initial global solution, DRAGON autonomously identifies regions with high optimization potential and strategically decompose large-scale COPs into manageable subproblems. Each subproblem is then reformulated as a concise, localized optimization task and solved through targeted LLM prompting guided by accumulated experiences. Finally, the locally optimized solutions are systematically reintegrated into the original global context to yield a significantly improved overall outcome. By continuously interacting with the optimization environment and leveraging an adaptive experience memory, the agents iteratively learn from feedback, effectively coupling symbolic reasoning with heuristic search. Empirical results show that, unlike existing LLM-based solvers limited to small-scale instances, DRAGON consistently produces feasible solutions on TSPLIB, CVRPLIB, and Weibull-5k bin packing benchmarks, and achieves near-optimal results (0.16% gap) on knapsack problems with over 3M variables. This work shows the potential of feedback-driven language agents as a new paradigm for generalizable and interpretable large-scale optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "DRAGON\uc740 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8

In educational settings, AI powered systems have become essential for predicting student performance due to their advanced analytical capabilities. However, effectively leveraging diverse student data to uncover latent and complex patterns remains a key challenge. While prior studies have explored this area, the potential of dynamic data features and multi category entities has been largely overlooked. To address this gap, we propose a framework that integrates heterogeneous graph deep learning models to enhance early and continuous student performance prediction, using traditional machine learning algorithms for comparison. Our approach employs a graph metapath structure and incorporates dynamic assessment features, which progressively influence the student success prediction task. Experiments on the Open University Learning Analytics (OULA) dataset demonstrate promising results, achieving a 68.6% validation F1 score with only 7% of the semester completed, and reaching up to 89.5% near the semester's end. Our approach outperforms top machine learning models by 4.7% in validation F1 score during the critical early 7% of the semester, underscoring the value of dynamic features and heterogeneous graph representations in student success prediction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ud559\uc0dd \uc131\uacf5\uc758 \uc870\uae30 \uc2dd\ubcc4\uc740 \uc801\uc2dc \uac1c\uc785, \uc774\ud0c8\ub960 \uac10\uc18c \ubc0f \uc815\uc2dc \uc878\uc5c5\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ub2a5\uacfc \ub2e4\uc911 \uce74\ud14c\uace0\ub9ac \uc5d4\ud130\ud2f0\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud559\uc0dd \uc131\uacfc \uc608\uce21\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ud558\ub294 \uc774\uc885 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ub525 \ub7ec\ub2dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud559\uc0dd \uc131\uacf5\uc744 \uc870\uae30\uc5d0 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ud559\uc0dd \uc774\ud0c8\ub960\uc744 \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0, \uc801\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uac1c\uc785\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uae30\ud68c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uc815\uc2dc \uc878\uc5c5\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc774\uc885 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ub525 \ub7ec\ub2dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ud559\uc0dd \uc131\uacfc \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "Open University Learning Analytics (OULA) \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \ud559\uae30 \ucd08 7%\uc5d0\uc11c 68.6%\uc758 \uac80\uc99d F1 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0, \ud559\uae30 \uc885\ub8cc \uc2dc\uc810\uc5d0 89.5%\uc5d0 \ub3c4\ub2ec\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \ud559\uae30 \ucd08\uc758 \uc911\uc694\ud55c 7%\uc5d0\uc11c \uac80\uc99d F1 \uc810\uc218\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c1\uc704 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 4.7% \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub3d9\uc801 \ud2b9\uc131\uacfc \uc774\uc885 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ud45c\ud604\uc758 \uac00\uce58\ub294 \ud559\uc0dd \uc131\uacf5 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0\uc11c \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ub192\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud559\uc0dd \uc131\uacf5\uc758 \uc870\uae30 \uc2dd\ubcc4\uc740 \uc801\uc2dc \uac1c\uc785\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uace0, \uc774\ud0c8\ub960\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uba70, \uc815\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uc878\uc5c5\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \uad50\uc721 \ud604\uc7a5\uc5d0\uc11c AI \uae30\ubc18 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uace0\uae09 \ubd84\uc11d \ub2a5\ub825 \ub355\ubd84\uc5d0 \ud559\uc0dd \uc131\uacfc \uc608\uce21\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\uac8c \ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud559\uc0dd \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ubc1d\ud600\ub0b4\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc8fc\uc694 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774\uc804 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub4e4\uc774 \uc774 \ubd84\uc57c\ub97c \ud0d0\uad6c\ud588\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub3d9\uc801 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ub2a5\uacfc \ub2e4\uc911 \uce74\ud14c\uace0\ub9ac \uc5d4\ud130\ud2f0\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc740 \ud06c\uac8c \uac04\uacfc\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uac04\uadf9\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec \uc870\uae30 \ubc0f \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ud559\uc0dd \uc131\uacfc \uc608\uce21\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ud558\ub294 \uc774\uc885 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ub525 \ub7ec\ub2dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uba54\ud0c0\ud328\uc2a4 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uace0 \ub3d9\uc801 \ud3c9\uac00 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uc5ec, \uc774\ub294 \ud559\uc0dd \uc131\uacf5 \uc608\uce21 \uacfc\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc810\uc9c4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce5c\ub2e4.

Existing approaches to Intent-Based Networking (IBN) rely upon either rule-based systems that struggle with linguistic variation or end-to-end neural models that lack interpretability and fail to enforce operational constraints. This paper presents a hierarchical multi-agent framework where Large Language Model (LLM) based agents autonomously decompose natural language intents, consult domain-specific specialists, and synthesise technically feasible network slice configurations through iterative reasoning-action (ReAct) cycles. The proposed architecture employs an orchestrator agent coordinating two specialist agents, i.e., Radio Access Network (RAN) and Core Network agents, via ReAct-style reasoning, grounded in structured network state representations. Experimental evaluation across diverse benchmark scenarios shows that the proposed system outperforms rule-based systems and direct LLM prompting, with architectural principles applicable to Open RAN (O-RAN) deployments. The results also demonstrate that whilst contemporary LLMs possess general telecommunications knowledge, network automation requires careful prompt engineering to encode context-dependent decision thresholds, advancing autonomous orchestration capabilities for next-generation wireless systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 6G \ubb34\uc120 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758

Federated learning (FL) allows hospitals to collaboratively train models without sharing raw images, but current FL algorithms typically assume a static data distribution. In practice, hospitals experience continual evolution in case mix, annotation protocols, and imaging devices, which leads to catastrophic forgetting when models are updated sequentially. Federated continual learning (FCL) aims to reconcile these challenges but existing methods either ignore the stringent privacy constraints of healthcare or rely on replay buffers and public surrogate datasets that are difficult to justify in clinical settings. We study FCL for chest radiography classification in a setting where hospitals are clients that receive temporally evolving streams of cases and labels. We introduce DP-FedEPC (Differentially Private Federated Elastic Prototype Consolidation), a method that combines elastic weight consolidation (EWC), prototype-based rehearsal, and client-side differential privacy within a standard FedAvg framework. EWC constrains updates along parameters deemed important for previous tasks, while a memory of latent prototypes preserves class structure without storing raw images. Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) at each client adds calibrated Gaussian noise to clipped gradients, providing formal privacy guarantees for individual radiographs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcd1\uc6d0\ub4e4\uc774 \ud611\ub825\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5(FL) \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc5f0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\ud3ec \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \uc5f0\ud569 \uc9c0\uc18d \ud559\uc2b5(FCL) \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \uc18c\uac1c\ub41c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uae30\uad00 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \ubc29\uc0ac\uc120 \ud574\uc11d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc \uaddc\uc81c\uc640 \ubcd1\uc6d0 \uac04\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\ud3ec \ubcc0\ud654\uac00 \uc911\uc559 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc0c1\uc2dc \ubc1c\uc804\ud558\ub294 \uc0ac\ub840\uc640 \ub808\uc774\ube14 \ud750\ub984\uc744 \ubc1b\ub294 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\ub85c\uc11c \ubcd1\uc6d0 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ud749\ubd80 \ubc29\uc0ac\uc120 \ubd84\ub958\ub97c \uc704\ud55c FCL\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uba70, DP-FedEPC\ub77c\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 EWC(Elastic Weight Consolidation), \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ud0c0\uc785 \uae30\ubc18 \ub9ac\ud5c8\uc124, \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uce21 \ucc28\ubcc4\uc801 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "EWC\ub294 \uc774\uc804 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4\uace0 \uac04\uc8fc\ub41c \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130\ub97c \ub530\ub77c \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \uc81c\uc57d\ud558\uba70, \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ud0c0\uc785\uc758 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\ub294 \uc6d0\ubcf8 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub97c \uc800\uc7a5\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0\ub3c4 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ubcf4\uc874\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uac01 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c DP-SGD\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud074\ub9ac\ud551\ub41c \uae30\uc6b8\uae30\uc5d0 \uc870\uc815\ub41c \uac00\uc6b0\uc2a4 \ub178\uc774\uc988\ub97c \ucd94\uac00\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368, \uac1c\ubcc4 \ubc29\uc0ac\uc120 \uc0ac\uc9c4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacf5\uc2dd\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubc29\uc0ac\uc120 \ud574\uc11d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub2e4\uae30\uad00 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc \uaddc\uc81c\uc640 \ubcd1\uc6d0 \uac04\uc758 \ubd84\ud3ec \ubcc0\ud654\ub85c \uc911\uc559 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud480\ub9c1\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5(FL)\uc740 \ubcd1\uc6d0\ub4e4\uc774 \uc6d0\ubcf8 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub97c \uacf5\uc720\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0\ub3c4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud611\ub825\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud574\uc8fc\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 FL \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\uc801 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \uac00\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc2e4\uc81c\ub85c \ubcd1\uc6d0\ub4e4\uc740 \uc0ac\ub840 \ud63c\ud569, \uc8fc\uc11d \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c, \uc601\uc0c1 \uc7a5\ube44\uc758 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \uacbd\ud5d8\ud558\uac8c \ub418\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc21c\ucc28\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub420 \ub54c \uc7ac\uc559\uc801 \ub9dd\uac01\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc5f0\ud569 \uc9c0\uc18d \ud559\uc2b5(FCL)\uc740 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uc758\ub8cc\uc758 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ubb34\uc2dc\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc784\uc0c1 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ud569\ub9ac\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \uc7ac\uc0dd \ubc84\ud37c\uc640 \uacf5\uac1c \ub300\uccb4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubcd1\uc6d0\uc774 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubc1c\uc804\ud558\ub294 \uc0ac\ub840\uc640 \ub808\uc774\ube14\uc758 \uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9bc\uc744 \ubc1b\ub294 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\ub85c\uc11c \ud749\ubd80 \ubc29\uc0ac\uc120 \ubd84\ub958\ub97c \uc704\ud55c FCL\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uba70, DP-FedEPC(\ucc28\ubcc4\uc801 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc \uc5f0\ud569 \ud0c4\ub825\uc801 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ud0c0\uc785 \ud1b5\ud569)\ub77c\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4.

While these advancements promise significant productivity gains, they also introduce critical safety risks that remain under-explored. Existing safety evaluations primarily focus on simple, daily assistance tasks, failing to capture the intricate decision-making processes and potential consequences of misaligned behaviors in professional settings. To address this gap, we introduce \\textbf{SafePro}, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the safety alignment of AI agents performing professional activities. SafePro features a dataset of high-complexity tasks across diverse professional domains with safety risks, developed through a rigorous iterative creation and review process. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art AI models reveals significant safety vulnerabilities and uncovers new unsafe behaviors in professional contexts.

Although most existing research assumes utility functions to be linear in item features, this linearity assumption restricts the modeling of intricate interactions between items and user preferences. A recent work (Zhang & Luo, 2024) has investigated general utility function classes, yet its method faces fundamental trade-offs between computational tractability and statistical efficiency. To address this limitation, we propose a computationally efficient algorithm for MNL contextual bandits leveraging the upper confidence bound principle, specifically designed for non-linear parametric utility functions, including those modeled by neural networks. Under a realizability assumption and a mild geometric condition on the utility function class, our algorithm achieves a regret bound of $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$, where $T$ denotes the total number of rounds. Our result establishes that sharp $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$-regret is attainable even with neural network-based utilities, without relying on strong assumptions such as neural tangent kernel approximations. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed method is the first computationally tractable algorithm for MNL contextual bandits with non-linear utilities that provably attains $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$ regret.

Existing general-purpose benchmarks provide broad coverage but lack the depth and domain fidelity needed to assess LMs' capabilities for real-world financial reasoning, which requires both conceptual understanding and quantitative rigor. To address this gap, we introduce FinForge, a scalable, semi-synthetic pipeline for constructing finance-specific evaluation benchmarks through a hybrid of expert-guided data curation and controlled LM-based synthesis. FinForge combines manual and programmatic corpus construction from authoritative financial sources with structured question generation and validation using Gemini 2.5 Flash. To demonstrate the pipeline's efficacy, we produce FinForge-5k, a snapshot benchmark comprising over 5,000 human-validated question-answer pairs across 11 finance subdomains, derived from a curated corpus of 100,000 verified documents totaling 143M tokens. Evaluation of state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source models on FinForge-5k reveals significant differences in financial reasoning, with leading models achieving accuracy levels near 80%.

The methylation status of the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene promoter is a critical molecular biomarker that influences patient response to temozolomide chemotherapy. Traditional methods for determining MGMT status rely on invasive biopsies and are limited by intratumoral heterogeneity and procedural risks. This study presents a radiogenomic molecular imaging analysis framework for the non-invasive prediction of MGMT promoter methylation using multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI).\n  Our approach integrates radiomics, deep learning, and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to analyze MRI-derived imaging phenotypes and correlate them with molecular labels. Radiomic features are extracted from FLAIR, T1-weighted, T1-contrast-enhanced, and T2-weighted MRI sequences, while a 3D convolutional neural network learns deep representations from the same modalities. These complementary features are fused using both early fusion and attention-based strategies and classified to predict MGMT methylation status.\n  To enhance clinical interpretability, we apply XAI methods such as Grad-CAM and SHAP to visualize and explain model decisions. The proposed framework is trained on the RSNA-MICCAI Radiogenomic Classification dataset and externally validated on the BraTS 2021 dataset.

Current automated chemical design methodologies focus mainly on various representations of process flow diagrams. However, transforming these diagrams into executable simulation flowsheets remains a time-consuming and labor-intensive endeavor, requiring extensive manual parameter configuration within simulation software. In this work, we propose a novel multi-agent workflow that leverages the semantic understanding capabilities of large language models(LLMs) and enables iterative interactions with chemical process simulation software, achieving end-to-end automated simulation from textual process specifications to computationally validated software configurations for design enhancement. Our approach integrates four specialized agents responsible for task understanding, topology generation, parameter configuration, and evaluation analysis, respectively, coupled with Enhanced Monte Carlo Tree Search to accurately interpret semantics and robustly generate configurations. Evaluated on Simona, a large-scale process description dataset, our method achieves a 31.1% improvement in the simulation convergence rate compared to state-of-the-art baselines and reduces the design time by 89. 0% compared to the expert manual design. This work demonstrates the potential of AI-assisted chemical process design, which bridges the gap between conceptual design and practical implementation. Our workflow is applicable to diverse process-oriented industries, including pharmaceuticals, petrochemicals, food processing, and manufacturing, offering a generalizable solution for automated process design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ud654\ud559 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \uc0ac\uc591\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\uc791\ud558\uc5ec \uacc4\uc0b0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\uc99d\ub41c \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uad6c\uc131\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \ucd5c\uc885 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud654\ud559 \uacf5\ud559 \uc124\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc740 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc694\uc18c\uc774\uba70, \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ud654\ud559 \uc124\uacc4 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc740 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \ud750\ub984 \ub2e4\uc774\uc5b4\uadf8\ub7a8\uc758 \ud45c\ud604\uc5d0 \uc8fc\ub85c \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd98\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc774\ud574 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uace0 \ud654\ud559 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4\uc640 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 Simona\ub77c\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \uc124\uba85 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uae30\uc900 \ub300\ube44 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uc218\ub834\ub960\uc774 31.1% \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\uc5c8\uace0 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc218\ub3d9 \uc124\uacc4 \ub300\ube44 \uc124\uacc4 \uc2dc\uac04\uc774 89.0% \ub2e8\ucd95\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc791\uc5c5\uc740 AI \uc9c0\uc6d0 \ud654\ud559 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \uc124\uacc4\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uac1c\ub150 \uc124\uacc4\uc640 \uc2e4\uc81c \uad6c\ud604 \uac04\uc758 \uac04\uadf9\uc744 \uc5f0\uacb0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc740 \ud654\ud559 \uacf5\ud559 \uc124\uacc4\uc758 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ucd08\uc11d\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ud654\ud559 \uc124\uacc4 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc740 \uc8fc\ub85c \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \ud750\ub984 \ub2e4\uc774\uc5b4\uadf8\ub7a8\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud45c\ud604\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub2e4\uc774\uc5b4\uadf8\ub7a8\uc744 \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ud750\ub984\ub3c4\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc18c\ubaa8\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ub178\ub3d9 \uc9d1\uc57d\uc801\uc778 \uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c, \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc218\ub3d9 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \uad6c\uc131\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc774\ud574 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud654\ud559 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4\uc640\uc758 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \uc0ac\uc591\uc5d0\uc11c \uc124\uacc4 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uacc4\uc0b0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\uc99d\ub41c \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uad6c\uc131\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \uc5d4\ub4dc \ud22c \uc5d4\ub4dc \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uac01\uac01 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc774\ud574, \ud1a0\ud3f4\ub85c\uc9c0 \uc0dd\uc131, \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \uad6c\uc131 \ubc0f \ud3c9\uac00 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ub2f4\ub2f9\ud558\ub294 \ub124 \uac1c\uc758 \uc804\ubb38 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uba70, \uc758\ubbf8\ub97c \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \ud574\uc11d\ud558\uace0 \uacac\uace0\ud558\uac8c \uad6c\uc131\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 Enhanced Monte Carlo Tree Search\uc640 \uacb0\ud569\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Chadwick"], "title": "Hallucinations Live in Variance", "comment": "8 pages, 3 figures", "summary": "Benchmarks measure whether a model is correct. They do not measure whether a model is reliable. This distinction is largely academic for single-shot inference, but becomes critical for agentic AI systems, where a single rephrased prompt can trigger cascading failures in multi-step execution. Yet this form of instability is not captured by existing evaluations.\n  Hallucinations live in variance: they arise when semantically equivalent prompts activate inconsistent internal pathways, producing divergent outputs. Consistent but incorrect outputs reflect bias or missing knowledge; confident guessing reflects calibration failure. Neither constitutes hallucination under this definition. When error is variance-dominated, reducing redundant pathways improves reliability without adding knowledge. We formalize this through Semantic Stability (SS), measured via Paraphrase Consistency (PC@k): generate k paraphrases, greedy decode each, compute mode agreement. SS is a diagnostic for variance-driven unreliability, not a method for improving correctness.\n  We show that a dense Qwen3-0.6B agrees with itself only 23.8% of the time; at 32% sparsity, agreement jumps to 55.9%.

However, current methods often rely on static or offline critic models, which fail to adapt as the policy evolves. In on-policy RL, the agent's error patterns shift over time, causing stationary critics to become stale and providing feedback of diminishing utility. To address this, we introduce ECHO (Evolving Critic for Hindsight-Guided Optimization)}, a framework that jointly optimizes the policy and critic through a synchronized co-evolutionary loop. ECHO utilizes a cascaded rollout mechanism where the critic generates multiple diagnoses for an initial trajectory, followed by policy refinement to enable group-structured advantage estimation. We address the challenge of learning plateaus via a saturation-aware gain shaping objective, which rewards the critic for inducing incremental improvements in high-performing trajectories. By employing dual-track GRPO updates, ECHO ensures the critic's feedback stays synchronized with the evolving policy. Experimental results show that ECHO yields more stable training and higher long-horizon task success across open-world environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "ECHO\ub294 \uc815\ucc45\uacfc \ube44\ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uacfc \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 \ube44\ud3c9\uac00 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc815\ucc45\uc758 \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uc5ec \ud6c8\ub828\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc774 \ub5a8\uc5b4\uc9c0\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "ECHO\ub294 \ube44\ud3c9\uac00\uac00 \ucd08\uae30 \uada4\uc801\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc9c4\ub2e8\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ub3d9\uae30\ud654\ub41c \uacf5\uc9c4\ud654 \ub8e8\ud504\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "ECHO\ub294 \ub354\uc6b1 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \ud6c8\ub828\uacfc \ub192\uc740 \uc7a5\uae30 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "ECHO\ub294 \uac1c\ubc29\ud615 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294\ub370 \uae30\uc5ec\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ube44\ud3c9\uac00 \uc548\ub0b4 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc740 \ud76c\uc18c\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\uc644\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc73c\ub85c \ub5a0\uc62c\ub790\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uc815\uc801 \ub610\ub294 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \ube44\ud3c9\uac00 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc815\ucc45\uc774 \ubc1c\uc804\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc801\uc751\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc628\uc815\ucc45 RL\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc624\ub958 \ud328\ud134\uc774 \uc2dc\uac04\uc774 \uc9c0\ub0a8\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ubcc0\ud654\ud558\uc5ec, \uc815\uc801\uc778 \ube44\ud3c9\uac00\ub4e4\uc774 \ub0a1\uc544\uc9c0\uace0 \uc720\uc6a9\uc131\uc774 \uac10\uc18c\ud558\ub294 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 ECHO (\ud6c4\ud68c \uc548\ub0b4 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc9c4\ud654 \ube44\ud3c9\uac00)\ub77c\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.

Shivnaraine", "Kyle Swanson"], "title": "Generating readily synthesizable small molecule fluorophore scaffolds with reinforcement learning", "comment": null, "summary": "Developing new fluorophores for advanced imaging techniques requires exploring new chemical space. While generative AI approaches have shown promise in designing novel dye scaffolds, prior efforts often produced synthetically intractable candidates due to a lack of reaction constraints. Here, we developed SyntheFluor-RL, a generative AI model that employs known reaction libraries and molecular building blocks to create readily synthesizable fluorescent molecule scaffolds via reinforcement learning. To guide the generation of fluorophores, SyntheFluor-RL employs a scoring function built on multiple graph neural networks (GNNs) that predict key photophysical properties, including photoluminescence quantum yield, absorption, and emission wavelengths. These outputs are dynamically weighted and combined with a computed pi-conjugation score to prioritize candidates with desirable optical characteristics and synthetic feasibility. SyntheFluor-RL generated 11,590 candidate molecules, which were filtered to 19 structures predicted to possess dye-like properties. Of the 19 molecules, 14 were synthesized and 13 were experimentally confirmed. The top three were characterized, with the lead compound featuring a benzothiadiazole chromophore and exhibiting strong fluorescence (PLQY = 0.62), a large Stokes shift (97 nm), and a long excited-state lifetime (11.5 ns).

Here we show that large language models spontaneously develop synergistic cores -- components where information integration exceeds individual parts -- remarkably similar to those in the human brain. Using principles of information decomposition across multiple LLM model families and architectures, we find that areas in middle layers exhibit synergistic processing while early and late layers rely on redundancy, mirroring the informational organisation in biological brains. This organisation emerges through learning and is absent in randomly initialised networks. Crucially, ablating synergistic components causes disproportionate behavioural changes and performance loss, aligning with theoretical predictions about the fragility of synergy. Moreover, fine-tuning synergistic regions through reinforcement learning yields significantly greater performance gains than training redundant components, yet supervised fine-tuning shows no such advantage. This convergence suggests that synergistic information processing is a fundamental property of intelligence, providing targets for principled model design and testable predictions for biological intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc778\uac04 \ub1cc\uc640 \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uc2dc\ub108\uc9c0 \ucf54\uc5b4\ub97c \ubc1c\ub2ec\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc815\ubcf4 \ud1b5\ud569\uc758 \uae30\ubcf8 \uc6d0\ub9ac\ub97c \uc774\ud574\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801 \ubc0f \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc758 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \uc9c4\ud654\ub294 \uadf8 \uae30\ubcf8 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc6d0\ub9ac\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uae30\ud68c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc5ec\ub7ec LLM \ubaa8\ub378 \uacc4\uc5f4\uacfc \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubd84\ud574 \uc6d0\ub9ac\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc911\uac04 \uce35\uc758 \uc601\uc5ed\uc774 \uc2dc\ub108\uc9c0 \ucc98\ub9ac\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\uba70, \ucd08\ubc18 \ubc0f \ud6c4\ubc18 \uce35\uc774 \uc911\ubcf5\uc131\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud568\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2dc\ub108\uc9c0 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \uc81c\uac70\ud558\uba74 \ube44\ub840\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \ud589\ub3d9 \ubcc0\ud654\uc640 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc190\uc2e4\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc2dc\ub108\uc9c0\uc758 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc608\uce21\uacfc \uc77c\uce58\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc2dc\ub108\uc9c0 \uc815\ubcf4 \ucc98\ub9ac\ub294 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc758 \uae30\ubcf8 \ud2b9\uc131\uc784\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc6d0\uce59\uc801\uc778 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc124\uacc4\uc758 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc640 \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uacfc \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc758 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \uc9c4\ud654\ub294 \uadf8 \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc6d0\ub9ac\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub3c5\ud2b9\ud55c \uae30\ud68c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5ec\uae30\uc11c\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc778\uac04 \ub1cc\uc640 \ub180\ub78d\ub3c4\ub85d \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uc2dc\ub108\uc9c0 \ucf54\uc5b4\ub97c \uc790\ubc1c\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5ec\ub7ec LLM \ubaa8\ub378 \uacc4\uc5f4\uacfc \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4 \ubd84\ud574 \uc6d0\ub9ac\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc911\uac04 \uce35\uc758 \uc601\uc5ed\uc774 \uc2dc\ub108\uc9c0 \ucc98\ub9ac\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\uba70, \ucd08\uae30 \ubc0f \ub9d0\uae30 \uce35\uc740 \uc911\ubcf5\uc131\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud568\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc870\uc9c1\uc740 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub098\ud0c0\ub098\uba70 \ubb34\uc791\uc704\ub85c \ucd08\uae30\ud654\ub41c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\ub294 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788, \uc2dc\ub108\uc9c0 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \uc81c\uac70\ud558\uba74 \ube44\ub840\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud070 \ud589\ub3d9 \ubcc0\ud654\uc640 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc190\uc2e4\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc2dc\ub108\uc9c0\uc758 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc608\uce21\uacfc \uc77c\uce58\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub354\uc6b1\uc774, \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2dc\ub108\uc9c0 \uc601\uc5ed\uc744 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ud558\uba74 \uc911\ubcf5 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uac83\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud6e8\uc52c \ub354 \ud070 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uac00\uc838\uc624\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uac10\ub3c5\ub41c \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uadf8\ub7ec\ud55c \uc774\uc810\uc774 \uc5c6\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc218\ub834\uc740 \uc2dc\ub108\uc9c0 \uc815\ubcf4 \ucc98\ub9ac\uac00 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc758 \uae30\ubcf8 \uc18d\uc131\uc784\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc6d0\uce59\uc801\uc778 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ubaa9\ud45c\uc640 \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, OMRL still suffers extrapolation errors due to out-of-distribution (OOD) actions, compromised by broad task distributions and Markov Decision Process (MDP) ambiguity in meta-RL setups. Existing research indicates that the generalization of the $Q$ network affects the extrapolation error in offline RL. This paper investigates this relationship by decomposing the $Q$ value into feature and weight components, observing that while decomposition enhances adaptability and convergence in the case of high-quality data, it often leads to policy degeneration or collapse in complex tasks. We observe that decomposed $Q$ values introduce a large estimation bias when the feature encounters OOD samples, a phenomenon we term ''feature overgeneralization''. To address this issue, we propose FLORA, which identifies OOD samples by modeling feature distributions and estimating their uncertainties.

However, existing LLM-based agent training framework often focuses on answers' accuracy, overlooking specific alignment for behavior patterns. Consequently, agent often exhibits ineffective actions during TIR tasks, such as redundant and insufficient tool calls. How to calibrate erroneous behavioral patterns when executing TIR tasks, thereby exploring effective trajectories, remains an open-ended problem. In this paper, we propose ET-Agent, a training framework for calibrating agent's tool-use behavior through two synergistic perspectives: Self-evolving Data Flywheel and Behavior Calibration Training. Specifically, we introduce a self-evolutionary data flywheel to generate enhanced data, used to fine-tune LLM to improve its exploration ability. Based on this, we implement an two-phases behavior-calibration training framework. It is designed to progressively calibrate erroneous behavioral patterns to optimal behaviors. Further in-depth experiments confirm the superiority of \\ourmodel{} across multiple dimensions, including correctness, efficiency, reasoning conciseness, and tool execution accuracy. Our ET-Agent framework provides practical insights for research in the TIR field.

Extending GRPO to open-domain settings remains a critical challenge, as unconstrained generation entails multi-faceted and often conflicting objectives - such as creativity versus factuality - where rigid, static reward scalarization is inherently suboptimal. To address this, we propose MAESTRO (Meta-learning Adaptive Estimation of Scalarization Trade-offs for Reward Optimization), which introduces a meta-cognitive orchestration layer that treats reward scalarization as a dynamic latent policy, leveraging the model's terminal hidden states as a semantic bottleneck to perceive task-specific priorities. We formulate this as a contextual bandit problem within a bi-level optimization framework, where a lightweight Conductor network co-evolves with the policy by utilizing group-relative advantages as a meta-reward signal. Across seven benchmarks, MAESTRO consistently outperforms single-reward and static multi-objective baselines, while preserving the efficiency advantages of GRPO, and in some settings even reducing redundant generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "MAESTRO\ub294 LLM\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub3d9\uc801 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc2a4\uce7c\ub77c\ud654 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \uba54\ud0c0 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uc5ec, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc815\uc801 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubaa9\ud45c \uc0ac\uc774\uc758 \uac70\ub798\ub97c \uc870\uc728\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "GRPO\ub294 LLM\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uac1c\ubc29\ud615 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \ub370\ud55c\uacc4\uac00 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "MAESTRO\ub294 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc2a4\uce7c\ub77c\ud654\ub97c \ub3d9\uc801 \uc7a0\uc7ac \uc815\ucc45\uc73c\ub85c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \uba54\ud0c0 \uc778\uc9c0 \uc624\ucf00\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \uc774\uc911 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ub9e5\ub77d\uc801 \uc7a1\uae30 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \ud615\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uacbd\ub7c9\uc758 \ucee8\ub355\ud130 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 \uc815\ucc45\uacfc \uacf5\uc9c4\ud558\uc5ec \uadf8\ub8f9 \uc0c1\ub300 \uc774\uc810\uc744 \uba54\ud0c0 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc2e0\ud638\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "MAESTRO\ub294 \uc77c\uacf1 \uac1c\uc758 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e8\uc77c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubc0f \uc815\uc801 \ub2e4\ubaa9\uc801 \uae30\uc900\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, GRPO\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \uc7a5\uc810\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \uc77c\ubd80 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc911\ubcf5 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc904\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "MAESTRO\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c LLM\uc758 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc870\uc728\uc744 \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc5ec, \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uacb0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uadf8\ub8f9 \uc0c1\ub300 \uc815\ucc45 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654(GRPO)\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \uc815\ub82c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc73c\ub85c \ub4f1\uc7a5\ud588\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uadf8 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc740 \uc8fc\ub85c \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud604\uc2e4 \uc9c4\ub9ac\uc5d0 \uad6d\ud55c\ub41c\ub2e4.

Traditional methods rely on bounding box or center-point regression, neglecting spatial interaction uncertainty and visual-semantic hierarchies. Recent methods incorporate attention mechanisms but still face two key issues: (1) ignoring processing background regions causes attention drift from the desired area, and (2) uniform modeling the target UI element fails to distinguish between its center and edges, leading to click imprecision. Inspired by how humans visually process and interact with GUI elements, we propose the Valley-to-Peak (V2P) method to address these issues. To mitigate background distractions, V2P introduces a suppression attention mechanism that minimizes the model's focus on irrelevant regions to highlight the intended region. For the issue of center-edge distinction, V2P applies a Fitts' Law-inspired approach by modeling GUI interactions as 2D Gaussian heatmaps where the weight gradually decreases from the center towards the edges. The weight distribution follows a Gaussian function, with the variance determined by the target's size. Consequently, V2P effectively isolates the target area and teaches the model to concentrate on the most essential point of the UI element. The model trained by V2P achieves the performance with 92.4\\% and 52.5\\% on two benchmarks ScreenSpot-v2 and ScreenSpot-Pro (see Fig.~\\ref{fig:main_results_charts}). Ablations further confirm each component's contribution, underscoring V2P's generalizability in precise GUI grounding tasks and its potential for real-world deployment in future GUI agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc815\ud655\ud55c GUI \uc694\uc18c\uc758 \uc704\uce58 \ud30c\uc545\uc744 \uc704\ud55c V2P \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "GUI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4 GUI \uc694\uc18c\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc704\uce58 \ud30c\uc545\uc740 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "V2P \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ubc30\uacbd\uc758 \uac04\uc12d\uc744 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc5b5\uc81c \uc8fc\uc758 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0, \uc911\uc2ec\uacfc \uac00\uc7a5\uc790\ub9ac \uad6c\ubd84\uc744 \uc704\ud574 2D \uac00\uc6b0\uc2dc\uc548 \ud788\ud2b8\ub9f5\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "V2P\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 ScreenSpot-v2\uc5d0\uc11c 92.4%, ScreenSpot-Pro\uc5d0\uc11c 52.5%\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "V2P\ub294 GUI \uae30\ubc18 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0, \ud5a5\ud6c4 GUI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\uc81c \ubc30\uce58 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "GUI \uc694\uc18c\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc704\uce58 \ud30c\uc545\uc740 GUI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ubc14\uc6b4\ub529 \ubc15\uc2a4\ub098 \uc911\uc2ec\uc810 \ud68c\uadc0\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uacf5\uac04\uc801 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uacfc \uc2dc\uac01-\uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \uacc4\uce35\uc744 \ubb34\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uc8fc\uc758 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\ub098, \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4: (1) \ubc30\uacbd \uc601\uc5ed\uc744 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc544 \uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \uc601\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c \uc8fc\uc758\uac00 \ud750\ud2b8\ub7ec\uc9c0\uba70, (2) \ubaa9\ud45c UI \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \uade0\uc77c\ud558\uac8c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uc5ec \uc911\uc2ec\uacfc \uac00\uc7a5\uc790\ub9ac\ub97c \uad6c\ubcc4\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud574 \ud074\ub9ad\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc774 \ub5a8\uc5b4\uc9d1\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc778\uac04\uc774 GUI \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \uc2dc\uac01\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uace0 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc544 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 Valley-to-Peak(V2P) \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubc30\uacbd \ubc29\ud574 \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, V2P\ub294 \uad00\ub828 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc601\uc5ed\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc9d1\uc911\uc744 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \uc758\ub3c4\ub41c \uc601\uc5ed\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\ub294 \uc5b5\uc81c \uc8fc\uc758 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc911\uc2ec-\uac00\uc7a5\uc790\ub9ac \uad6c\ubd84 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, V2P\ub294 GUI \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 2D \uac00\uc6b0\uc2dc\uc548 \ud788\ud2b8\ub9f5\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uc5ec \uac00\uc911\uce58\uac00 \uc911\uc2ec\uc5d0\uc11c \uac00\uc7a5\uc790\ub9ac\ub85c \uc810\uc9c4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac10\uc18c\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc124\uacc4\ub41c Fitts' Law\uc5d0 \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc740 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac00\uc911\uce58 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub294 \uac00\uc6b0\uc2dc\uc548 \ud568\uc218\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uacb0\uc815\ub418\uace0, \ubd84\uc0b0\uc740 \ubaa9\ud45c \ud06c\uae30\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uacb0\uc815\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacb0\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, V2P\ub294 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc601\uc5ed\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\uace0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 UI \uc694\uc18c\uc758 \uac00\uc7a5 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc9c0\uc810\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \uad50\uc721\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

This paper presents a synthetic function-calling dataset designed for mental health assistance grounded in wearable health signals such as sleep, physical activity, cardiovascular measures, stress indicators, and metabolic data. The dataset maps diverse natural language queries to standardized API calls derived from a widely adopted health data schema.

However, the complexity of developing, evaluating, and iterating on LLM-based agent workflows presents significant barriers to researchers, particularly those without extensive software engineering expertise. We present FROAV (Framework for RAG Observation and Agent Verification), an open-source research platform that democratizes LLM agent research by providing a plug-and-play architecture combining visual workflow orchestration, a comprehensive evaluation framework, and extensible Python integration. FROAV implements a multi-stage Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline coupled with a rigorous \"LLM-as-a-Judge\" evaluation system, all accessible through intuitive graphical interfaces. Our framework integrates n8n for no-code workflow design, PostgreSQL for granular data management, FastAPI for flexible backend logic, and Streamlit for human-in-the-loop interaction. Through this integrated ecosystem, researchers can rapidly prototype RAG strategies, conduct prompt engineering experiments, validate agent performance against human judgments, and collect structured feedback-all without writing infrastructure code. We demonstrate the framework's utility through its application to financial document analysis, while emphasizing its material-agnostic architecture that adapts to any domain requiring semantic analysis.

We propose a novel framework for supervised LLM uncertainty quantification, learning a dedicated meta-model based on LLM Performance Predictors (LPPs) derived from LLM outputs: log-probabilities, entropy, and novel uncertainty attribution indicators. We demonstrate that our method enables cost-aware selective classification in real-world human-AI workflows: escalating high-risk cases while automating the rest. Experiments across state-of-the-art LLMs, including both off-the-shelf (Gemini, GPT) and open-source (Llama, Qwen), on multimodal and multilingual moderation tasks, show significant improvements over existing uncertainty estimators in accuracy-cost trade-offs. Beyond uncertainty estimation, the LPPs enhance explainability by providing new insights into failure conditions (e.g., ambiguous content vs. under-specified policy).

Diffusion-based generative decoders can deliver strong perceptual quality by leveraging learned image priors, but iterative stochastic denoising leads to high decoding delay. To enable low-latency decoding, we propose a flow-matching (FM) generative decoder under a new land-then-transport (LTT) paradigm that tightly integrates the physical wireless channel into a continuous-time probability flow. For AWGN channels, we build a Gaussian smoothing path whose noise schedule indexes effective noise levels, and derive a closed-form teacher velocity field along this path. A neural-network student vector field is trained by conditional flow matching, yielding a deterministic, channel-aware ODE decoder with complexity linear in the number of ODE steps. At inference, it only needs an estimate of the effective noise variance to set the ODE starting time. We further show that Rayleigh fading and MIMO channels can be mapped, via linear MMSE equalization and singular-value-domain processing, to AWGN-equivalent channels with calibrated starting times. Therefore, the same probability path and trained velocity field can be reused for Rayleigh and MIMO without retraining. Experiments on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and DIV2K over AWGN, Rayleigh, and MIMO demonstrate consistent gains over JPEG2000+LDPC, DeepJSCC, and diffusion-based baselines, while achieving good perceptual quality with only a few ODE steps.

Existing memory benchmarks primarily rely on user-agent conversational histories, which are temporally fragmented and insufficient for capturing continuous life trajectories. We introduce CloneMem, a benchmark for evaluating longterm memory in AI Clone scenarios grounded in non-conversational digital traces, including diaries, social media posts, and emails, spanning one to three years. CloneMem adopts a hierarchical data construction framework to ensure longitudinal coherence and defines tasks that assess an agent's ability to track evolving personal states.

Although deep learning approaches, particularly those leveraging Contrastive Learning (CL), are prominent for MTS representation, existing CL-based models face two key limitations: 1) neglecting clustering information during positive/negative sample pair construction, and 2) introducing unreasonable inductive biases, e.g., destroying time dependence and periodicity through augmentation strategies, compromising representation quality. This paper, therefore, proposes a Temporal-Frequency Enhanced Contrastive (TFEC) learning framework. To preserve temporal structure while generating low-distortion representations, a temporal-frequency Co-EnHancement (CoEH) mechanism is introduced. Accordingly, a synergistic dual-path representation and cluster distribution learning framework is designed to jointly optimize cluster structure and representation fidelity. Experiments on six real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate TFEC's superiority, achieving 4.48% average NMI gains over SOTA methods, with ablation studies validating the design.

This approach allows large language models (LLMs) to autonomously generate and solve complex problems, thereby improving their reasoning capabilities. However, multi-turn search agents struggle in data-free self-evolution due to the limited question diversity and the substantial compute required for multi-step reasoning and tool using. In this work, we introduce Dr. Zero, a framework enabling search agents to effectively self-evolve without any training data. In particular, we design a self-evolution feedback loop where a proposer generates diverse questions to train a solver initialized from the same base model. As the solver evolves, it incentivizes the proposer to produce increasingly difficult yet solvable tasks, thus establishing an automated curriculum to refine both agents. To enhance training efficiency, we also introduce hop-grouped relative policy optimization (HRPO). This method clusters structurally similar questions to construct group-level baselines, effectively minimizing the sampling overhead in evaluating each query's individual difficulty and solvability. Consequently, HRPO significantly reduces the compute requirements for solver training without compromising performance or stability. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that the data-free Dr. Zero matches or surpasses fully supervised search agents, proving that complex reasoning and search capabilities can emerge solely through self-evolution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc790\uae30 \uc9c4\ud654\uac00 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294

However, traditional Thromboelastography (TEG), a widely employed diagnostic modality, can only provide such outputs after nearly 1 hour of measurement. The delay might lead to elevated mortality rates. These issues clearly point out one of the key challenges for medical AI development: Mak-ing reasonable predictions based on very small data sets and accounting for variation between different patient populations, a task where conventional deep learning methods typically perform poorly. We present Physiological State Reconstruc-tion (PSR), a new algorithm specifically designed to take ad-vantage of dynamic changes between individuals and to max-imize useful information produced by small amounts of clini-cal data through mapping to reliable predictions and diagnosis. We develop MDFE to facilitate integration of varied temporal signals using multi-domain learning, and jointly learn high-level temporal interactions together with attentions via HLA; furthermore, the parameterized DAM we designed maintains the stability of the computed vital signs. PSR evaluates with 4 TEG-specialized data sets and establishes remarkable perfor-mance -- predictions of R2 > 0.98 for coagulation traits and error reduction around half compared to the state-of-the-art methods, and halving the inferencing time too.

IEEE conference format", "summary": "Large Language Model (LLM) agents struggle with long-horizon software engineering tasks due to \"Context Bloat.\" As interaction history grows, computational costs explode, latency increases, and reasoning capabilities degrade due to distraction by irrelevant past errors. Existing solutions often rely on passive, external summarization mechanisms that the agent cannot control. This paper proposes Focus, an agent-centric architecture inspired by the biological exploration strategies of Physarum polycephalum (slime mold). The Focus Agent autonomously decides when to consolidate key learnings into a persistent \"Knowledge\" block and actively withdraws (prunes) the raw interaction history. Using an optimized scaffold matching industry best practices (persistent bash + string-replacement editor), we evaluated Focus on N=5 context-intensive instances from SWE-bench Lite using Claude Haiku 4.5. With aggressive prompting that encourages frequent compression, Focus achieves 22.7% token reduction (14.9M -> 11.5M tokens) while maintaining identical accuracy (3/5 = 60% for both agents). Focus performed 6.0 autonomous compressions per task on average, with token savings up to 57% on individual instances. We demonstrate that capable models can autonomously self-regulate their context when given appropriate tools and prompting, opening pathways for cost-aware agentic systems without sacrificing task performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \"\ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ubd80\ud480\ub9bc\"\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc7a5\uae30 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\ub9c1 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801 \ud0d0\uc0ac \uc804\ub7b5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc544 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc778 Focus\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

However, performance can drop considerably when there is a shift in the distribution of data from training to test time. We study this phenomenon in a setting in which the training data come from multiple domains, and the test data come from a domain not seen at training that is subject to significant covariate shift. We present a new method for contrastive learning that incorporates domain labels to increase the domain invariance of learned representations, leading to improved out-of-distribution generalization. Our method adjusts the temperature parameter in the InfoNCE loss -- which controls the relative weighting of negative pairs -- using the probability that a negative sample comes from the same domain as the anchor. This upweights pairs from more similar domains, encouraging the model to discriminate samples based on domain-invariant attributes. Through experiments on a variant of the MNIST dataset, we demonstrate that our method yields better out-of-distribution performance than domain generalization baselines. Furthermore, our method maintains strong in-distribution task performance, substantially outperforming baselines on this measure.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uac04 \ubd88\ubcc0\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ub808\uc774\ube14\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub300\uc870\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc790\uc6d0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub808\uc774\ube14\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub300\uc870\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uac04\uc758 \ubd84\ud3ec \ubcc0\ud654\uac00 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc800\ud558\ub97c \uc77c\uc73c\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ub808\uc774\ube14\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ub300\uc870\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, InfoNCE \uc190\uc2e4\uc758 \uc628\ub3c4 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uc870\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \ubd80\uc815 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc758 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ub3d9\uc77c\uc131\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "MNIST \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b \ubcc0\ud615\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uae30\uc900\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud568\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc778\ub514\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9ac\ubdf0\uc158 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uae30\uc900\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\ub294 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc790\uae30 \uc9c0\ub3c4\uc2dd \uc0ac\uc804 \ud559\uc2b5\uacfc \ub300\uc870 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \ud76c\uc18c\ud55c \ub808\uc774\ube14 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc2dc \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c \ubd84\ud3ec\uac00 \ubcc0\ud560 \uacbd\uc6b0 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ud06c\uac8c \uc800\ud558\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uc624\uace0, \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc911\uc5d0 \ubcf4\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uc624\uba70 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uacf5\ubcc0\ub7c9 \uc774\ub3d9\uc744 \uacaa\ub294 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubc30\uc6b4 \ud45c\ud604\uc758 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ubd88\ubcc0\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ub808\uc774\ube14\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub300\uc870\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uc5ec, \ubd84\ud3ec \uc678 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ubd80\uc815 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc774 \uc575\ucee4\uc640 \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uc628 \ud655\ub960\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubd80\uc815 \uc30d\uc758 \uc0c1\ub300\uc801 \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub97c \uc81c\uc5b4\ud558\ub294 InfoNCE \uc190\uc2e4\uc758 \uc628\ub3c4 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uc870\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uc30d\uc758 \uac00\uc911\uce58\uac00 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ubd88\ubcc0 \ud2b9\uc131\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \uad6c\ubcc4\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc720\ub3c4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

PRISM: Disentangling SFT and RL Data via Gradient Concentration", "comment": null, "summary": "While Hybrid Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become the standard paradigm for training LLM agents, effective mechanisms for data allocation between these stages remain largely underexplored. Current data arbitration strategies often rely on surface-level heuristics that fail to diagnose intrinsic learning needs. Since SFT targets pattern consolidation through imitation while RL drives structural adaptation via exploration, misaligning data with these functional roles causes severe optimization interference. We propose PRISM, a dynamics-aware framework grounded in Schema Theory that arbitrates data based on its degree of cognitive conflict with the model's existing knowledge. By analyzing the spatial geometric structure of gradients, PRISM identifies data triggering high spatial concentration as high-conflict signals that require RL for structural restructuring. In contrast, data yielding diffuse updates is routed to SFT for efficient consolidation. Extensive experiments on WebShop and ALFWorld demonstrate that PRISM achieves a Pareto improvement, outperforming state-of-the-art hybrid methods while reducing computational costs by up to 3.22$\\times$. Our findings suggest that disentangling data based on internal optimization regimes is crucial for scalable and robust agent alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "PRISM\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uae30\uc874 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uacfc\uc758 \uc778\uc9c0\uc801 \uac08\ub4f1 \uc815\ub3c4\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc911\uc7ac\ud558\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc778\uc2dd \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "Hybrid Supervised Fine-Tuning(SFT)\uacfc Reinforcement Learning(RL) \uac04\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud560\ub2f9 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \ud0d0\uad6c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\ub2e4.", "method": "PRISM\uc740 Schema Theory\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uc5ec \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uc778\uc9c0\uc801 \uac08\ub4f1 \uc815\ub3c4\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc5ec \uc911\uc7ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "WebShop\uacfc ALFWorld\uc5d0\uc11c PRISM\uc740 \ucd5c\uc2e0 \ud63c\ud569 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\uba70 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \ucd5c\ub300 3.22\ubc30 \uc904\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub0b4\ubd80 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubc29\uce68\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uacac\uace0\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc815\ub82c\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud568\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uac10\ub3c5 \uc138\ubd80 \uc870\uc815(SFT) \ub4a4\uc5d0 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uac83\uc740 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ud45c\uc900 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc774 \ub418\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774 \ub2e8\uacc4 \uac04\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud560\ub2f9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84 \ud0d0\uad6c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc911\uc7ac \uc804\ub7b5\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \ud45c\uba74\uc801\uc778 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \ub0b4\uc7ac\uc801\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud544\uc694\ub97c \uc9c4\ub2e8\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Latham", "Andrew Saxe"], "title": "Optimal Learning Rate Schedule for Balancing Effort and Performance", "comment": null, "summary": "Learning how to learn efficiently is a fundamental challenge for biological agents and a growing concern for artificial ones. To learn effectively, an agent must regulate its learning speed, balancing the benefits of rapid improvement against the costs of effort, instability, or resource use. We introduce a normative framework that formalizes this problem as an optimal control process in which the agent maximizes cumulative performance while incurring a cost of learning. From this objective, we derive a closed-form solution for the optimal learning rate, which has the form of a closed-loop controller that depends only on the agent's current and expected future performance. Under mild assumptions, this solution generalizes across tasks and architectures and reproduces numerically optimized schedules in simulations. In simple learning models, we can mathematically analyze how agent and task parameters shape learning-rate scheduling as an open-loop control solution. Because the optimal policy depends on expectations of future performance, the framework predicts how overconfidence or underconfidence influence engagement and persistence, linking the control of learning speed to theories of self-regulated learning. We further show how a simple episodic memory mechanism can approximate the required performance expectations by recalling similar past learning experiences, providing a biologically plausible route to near-optimal behaviour. Together, these results provide a normative and biologically plausible account of learning speed control, linking self-regulated learning, effort allocation, and episodic memory estimation within a unified and tractable mathematical framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc18d\ub3c4\ub97c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uaddc\ubc94\uc801

However, this shift introduces input contexts that are inherently noisy, a reality that current sanitized benchmarks fail to capture. We introduce NoisyBench, a comprehensive benchmark that systematically evaluates model robustness across 11 datasets in RAG, reasoning, alignment, and tool-use tasks against diverse noise types, including random documents, irrelevant chat histories, and hard negative distractors. Our evaluation reveals a catastrophic performance drop of up to 80% in state-of-the-art models when faced with contextual distractors. Crucially, we find that agentic workflows often amplify these errors by over-trusting noisy tool outputs, and distractors can trigger emergent misalignment even without adversarial intent. We find that prompting, context engineering, SFT, and outcome-reward only RL fail to ensure robustness; in contrast, our proposed Rationale-Aware Reward (RARE) significantly strengthens resilience by incentivizing the identification of helpful information within noise.

Agentic Feedback Reasoning for Humorous Meme Detection", "comment": "LaMAS@AAAI 2026 (Oral)", "summary": "Humorous memes blend visual and textual cues to convey irony, satire, or social commentary, posing unique challenges for AI systems that must interpret intent rather than surface correlations. Existing multimodal or prompting-based models generate explanations for humor but operate in an open loop,lacking the ability to critique or refine their reasoning once a prediction is made. We propose FLoReNce, an agentic feedback reasoning framework that treats meme understanding as a closed-loop process during learning and an open-loop process during inference. In the closed loop, a reasoning agent is critiqued by a judge; the error and semantic feedback are converted into control signals and stored in a feedback-informed, non-parametric knowledge base. At inference, the model retrieves similar judged experiences from this KB and uses them to modulate its prompt, enabling better, self-aligned reasoning without finetuning. On the PrideMM dataset, FLoReNce improves both predictive performance and explanation quality over static multimodal baselines, showing that feedback-regulated prompting is a viable path to adaptive meme humor understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "FLoReNce\ub294 \ubc08 \uc774\ud574\ub97c \ub2eb\ud78c \ub8e8\ud504 \uacfc\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uace0, \uc5f4\ub9b0 \ub8e8\ud504 \uacfc\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\ub860\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \ucd94\ub860 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uc758\ub3c4\ub97c \ud574\uc11d\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294 \ub3c5\ud2b9\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "FLoReNce\ub294 \ud310\ub2e8\uc790\uac00 \ube44\ud3c9\ud558\ub294 \ub2eb\ud78c \ub8e8\ud504\uc640 \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uacbd\ud5d8\uc744 \uac00\uc838\uc624\ub294 \uc5f4\ub9b0 \ub8e8\ud504\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774\ub2e4.", "result": "FLoReNce\ub294 \uc608\uce21 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \uc124\uba85 \ud488\uc9c8 \ubaa8\ub450\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf30\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \uc870\uc808 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\uac00 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ubc08 \uc720\uba38 \uc774\ud574\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc720\ud6a8\ud55c \uacbd\ub85c\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc720\uba38\uac00 \ub2f4\uae34 \ubc08\uc740 \uc544\uc774\ub7ec\ub2c8, \ud48d\uc790 \ub610\ub294 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \ub17c\ud3c9\uc744 \uc804\ub2ec\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \ubc0f \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc801 \ub2e8\uc11c\ub97c \ud63c\ud569\ud558\uc5ec AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uac89\ud565\uae30\uc2dd \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4\uac00 \uc544\ub2cc \uc758\ub3c4\ub97c \ud574\uc11d\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294 \ub3c5\ud2b9\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uc81c\uae30\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ub610\ub294 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc720\uba38\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc608\uce21\uc774 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc9c4 \ud6c4\uc5d0\ub294 \uadf8\ub4e4\uc758 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ube44\ud310\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uc5ec \uc5f4\ub9b0 \ub8e8\ud504\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\ub3d9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 FLoReNce\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\ub294\ub370, \uc774\ub294 \ubc08 \uc774\ud574\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5 \uc2dc \ub2eb\ud78c \ub8e8\ud504 \uacfc\uc815\uc73c\ub85c, \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc \uc5f4\ub9b0 \ub8e8\ud504 \uacfc\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub8e8\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \ucd94\ub860 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2eb\ud78c \ub8e8\ud504\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ucd94\ub860 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ud310\ub2e8\uc790\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ube44\ud3c9\uc744 \ubc1b\uc73c\uba70, \uc624\ub958 \ubc0f \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc774 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc2e0\ud638\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ub418\uc5b4 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \uc815\ubcf4 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ube44\ubaa8\uc218\uc801 \uc9c0\uc2dd\ubca0\uc774\uc2a4\uc5d0 \uc800\uc7a5\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc774 \uc9c0\uc2dd\ubca0\uc774\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \ud310\ub2e8\ub41c \uacbd\ud5d8\uc744 \uac80\uc0c9\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \uc870\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815 \uc5c6\uc774 \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc790\uae30 \uc815\ub82c \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

As large language models move into real-world deployment, this ideal has been imported wholesale into inference stacks. Recent work from the Thinking Machines Lab has presented a detailed analysis of nondeterminism in LLM inference, showing how batch-invariant kernels and deterministic attention can enforce bitwise-identical outputs, positioning deterministic inference as a prerequisite for reproducibility and enterprise reliability.\n  In this paper, we take the opposite stance. We argue that, for LLMs, deterministic inference kills. It kills the ability to model uncertainty, suppresses emergent abilities, collapses reasoning into a single brittle path, and weakens safety alignment by hiding tail risks. LLMs implement conditional distributions over outputs, not fixed functions. Collapsing these distributions to a single canonical completion may appear reassuring, but it systematically conceals properties central to artificial cognition. We instead advocate Stochastic CHAOS, treating distributional variability as a signal to be measured and controlled.\n  Empirically, we show that deterministic inference is systematically misleading. Single-sample deterministic evaluation underestimates both capability and fragility, masking failure probability under paraphrases and noise. Phase-like transitions associated with emergent abilities disappear under greedy decoding. Multi-path reasoning degrades when forced onto deterministic backbones, reducing accuracy and diagnostic insight. Finally, deterministic evaluation underestimates safety risk by hiding rare but dangerous behaviors that appear only under multi-sample evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \uacb0\uc815\ub860\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc774 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc800\ud574\ud558\uace0, \ucd9c\ud604 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc5b5\uc555\ud558\uba70, \ub2e8\uc77c \ucde8\uc57d \uacbd\ub85c\ub85c reasoning\uc744 \ucd95\uc18c\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0, tail \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc228\uae40\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc548\uc804 \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \uc57d\ud654\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4\uace0 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub300\uc2e0\uc5d0 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc801 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc744 \uce21\uc815\ud558\uace0 \uc81c\uc5b4\ud560 \uc2e0\ud638\ub85c \uc0bc\uc544 Stochastic CHAOS\ub97c \uc9c0\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uacb0\uc815\ub860\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc740 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4\uc758 \uc774\uc0c1\uc801 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \uc790\ub9ac\uc7a1\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, LLM\uc758 \uc801\uc808\ud55c \uad00\ub9ac\uc640 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uc624\ud788\ub824 \ube44\uacb0\uc815\ub860\uc801 \uc811\uadfc\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uacb0\uc815\ub860\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\uc810\uc744 \uc2e4\uc99d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0, emergent abilities\uc640 \uba40\ud2f0 \ud328\uc2a4 reasoning\uc758 \uc800\ud558\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "result": "\uacb0\uc815\ub860\uc801 \ud3c9\uac00\uac00 \ub2a5\ub825\uacfc \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \uacfc\uc18c\ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0, \uc548\uc804 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc228\uae30\uba70, \ucd9c\ud604 \ub2a5\ub825\uacfc \ub2e4\uc911 \uc0d8\ud50c \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0\uc11c \ub098\ud0c0\ub098\ub294 \uc704\ud5d8\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uac04\uacfc\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uacb0\uc815\ub860\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ub300\uc2e0 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc801 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc744 \uc2e0\ud638\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ube44\uacb0\uc815\ub860\uc801 \uc811\uadfc\uc774 LLM\uc758 \ud2b9\uc131\uacfc \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub354 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc784\uc744 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uacb0\uc815\ub860\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc740 \uace0\uc804 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc548\uc2ec\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc774\uc0c1\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \ubc30\uce58\uac00 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc9d0\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc774 \uc774\uc0c1\uc774 \ucd94\ub860 \uc2a4\ud0dd\uc5d0 \uadf8\ub300\ub85c \ub3c4\uc785\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.

To address this challenge, we present Legal Reasoning with Agentic Search (LRAS), the first framework designed to transition legal LLMs from static and parametric \"closed-loop thinking\" to dynamic and interactive \"Active Inquiry\". By integrating Introspective Imitation Learning and Difficulty-aware Reinforcement Learning, LRAS enables LRMs to identify knowledge boundaries and handle legal reasoning complexity.

Project page: https://arkazhuo.github.io/ARM-homepage/", "summary": "Interactive large language model agents have advanced rapidly, but most remain specialized to a single environment and fail to adapt robustly to other environments. Model merging offers a training-free alternative by integrating multiple experts into a single model. In this paper, we propose Agent-Role Merging (ARM), an activation-guided, role-conditioned neuron transplantation method for model merging in LLM agents. ARM improves existing merging methods from static natural language tasks to multi-turn agent scenarios, and over the generalization ability across various interactive environments. This is achieved with a well designed 3-step framework: 1) constructing merged backbones, 2) selection based on its role-conditioned activation analysis, and 3) neuron transplantation for fine-grained refinements. Without gradient-based optimization, ARM improves cross-benchmark generalization while enjoying efficiency.

Traditional approaches to root cause analysis(RCA) rely on hard-coded graph traversal algorithms or rule-based correlation engines, which are costly to maintain and tightly coupled to the infrastructure model.\n  In this work, we introduce an agentic diagnostic framework where a Large Language Model (LLM) performs step-wise investigation using a constrained tool space exposed through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Instead of embedding causal logic or traversal algorithms into the application, the agent autonomously navigates the infrastructure model by invoking tools for service lookup, dependency retrieval, structured and unstructured data, and event analysis, and impact discovery. We define an investigation protocol that structures the agent's reasoning and ensures grounding, reproducibility, and safe handling of missing or ambiguous information.\n  This work lays the foundation for autonomous incident resolution and change impact mitigation. Future systems will not only diagnose and remediate infrastructure failures, but also predict the impact of planned changes on services and customers, enabling operators to mitigate risks before

Rather than relying on monolithic, end-to-end RL pipelines, OpenTinker decomposes agentic learning systems into lightweight, composable components with clearly defined abstraction boundaries. Users specify agents, environments, and interaction protocols, while inference and training are delegated to a managed execution runtime. OpenTinker introduces a centralized scheduler for managing training and inference workloads, including LoRA-based and full-parameter RL, supervised fine-tuning, and inference, over shared resources.

Existing offline MARL methods primarily constrain training within the dataset distribution, resulting in overly conservative policies that struggle to generalize beyond the support of the data. While model-based approaches offer a promising solution by expanding the original dataset with synthetic data generated from a learned world model, the high dimensionality, non-stationarity, and complexity of multi-agent systems make it challenging to accurately estimate the transitions and reward functions in offline MARL. Given the difficulty of directly modeling joint dynamics, we propose a local-to-global (LOGO) world model, a novel framework that leverages local predictions-which are easier to estimate-to infer global state dynamics, thus improving prediction accuracy while implicitly capturing agent-wise dependencies. Using the trained world model, we generate synthetic data to augment the original dataset, expanding the effective state-action space. To ensure reliable policy learning, we further introduce an uncertainty-aware sampling mechanism that adaptively weights synthetic data by prediction uncertainty, reducing approximation error propagation to policies. In contrast to conventional ensemble-based methods, our approach requires only an additional encoder for uncertainty estimation, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining accuracy. Extensive experiments across 8 scenarios against 8 baselines demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on standard offline MARL benchmarks, establishing a new model-based baseline for generalizable offline multi-agent learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(MARL)\uc740 \uc0ac\uc804

To address these limitations, we propose Temporal Semantic Memory (TSM), a memory framework that models semantic time for point-wise memory and supports the construction and utilization of durative memory. During memory construction, it first builds a semantic timeline rather than a dialogue one. Then, it consolidates temporally continuous and semantically related information into a durative memory. During memory utilization, it incorporates the query's temporal intent on the semantic timeline, enabling the retrieval of temporally appropriate durative memories and providing time-valid, duration-consistent context to support response generation. Experiments on LongMemEval and LoCoMo show that TSM consistently outperforms existing methods and achieves up to 12.2% absolute improvement in accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uae30\uc5b5\uc740 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uacfc\uac70 \ub300\ud654\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc778\uc2dd, \uc800\uc7a5 \ubc0f \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\ub098, \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uae30\uc5b5\uc758 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc744 \uc81c\ub300\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 Temporal Semantic Memory (TSM)\ub77c\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc5b5\uc740 \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc778 \uc694\uc18c\ub85c, LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uacfc\uac70 \ub300\ud654\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "Temporal Semantic Memory (TSM) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8\ud615 \uae30\uc5b5\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uace0 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801 \uae30\uc5b5\uc758 \uad6c\ucd95\uacfc \ud65c\uc6a9\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "LongMemEval \ubc0f LoCoMo\uc5d0\uc11c TSM\uc740 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \ucd5c\ub300 12.2%\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4 \uc808\ub300 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uae30\uc5b5\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uacfc\uac70 \ub300\ud654\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc778\uc2dd, \uc800\uc7a5 \ubc0f \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc694\uc18c\ub85c, \uc774\ub294 \uac1c\uc778\ud654\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uae30\uc5b5\uc758 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc744 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\ub300\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c\ub2e4: 1) \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \ubd80\uc815\ud655\uc131: \uae30\uc5b5\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \ubc1c\uc0dd \uc2dc\uac04\uc774 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \ub300\ud654 \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uad6c\uc131\ub41c\ub2e4; 2) \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \ubd84\uc5f4: \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uc810\ubcc4 \uae30\uc5b5\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\ud558\uc5ec \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc640 \ubcc0\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc783\uc5b4\ubc84\ub9b0\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc810\ubcc4 \uae30\uc5b5\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uace0 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801 \uae30\uc5b5\uc758 \uad6c\ucd95\uacfc \ud65c\uc6a9\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 Temporal Semantic Memory (TSM)\ub77c\ub294 \uae30\uc5b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uae30\uc5b5 \uad6c\ucd95 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c, TSM\uc740 \uba3c\uc800 \ub300\ud654 \uc2dc\uac04 \ub300\uc2e0 \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \ud0c0\uc784\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ud6c4 \uc2dc\uac04\uc774 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5f0\uacb0\ub41c \uc758\ubbf8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad00\ub828\ub41c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801 \uae30\uc5b5\uc73c\ub85c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4. \uae30\uc5b5 \ud65c\uc6a9 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ucffc\ub9ac\uc758 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \uc758\ub3c4\ub97c \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \ud0c0\uc784\ub77c\uc778\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc2dc\uac04\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc801\uc808\ud55c \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801 \uae30\uc5b5\uc744 \uac80\uc0c9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud558\uba70, \uc751\ub2f5 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc720\ud6a8\ud558\uace0 \uc9c0\uc18d \uae30\uac04 \uc77c\uad00\uc801\uc778 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.

However, most existing approaches store memory in fixed representations and reuse it at a single or implicit level of abstraction, which limits generalization and often leads to negative transfer when distribution shift. This paper proposes the Meta-Cognitive Memory Abstraction method (MCMA), which treats memory abstraction as a learnable cognitive skill rather than a fixed design choice. MCMA decouples task execution from memory management by combining a frozen task model with a learned memory copilot. The memory copilot is trained using direct preference optimization, it determines how memories should be structured, abstracted, and reused. Memories are further organized into a hierarchy of abstraction levels, enabling selective reuse based on task similarity. When no memory is transferable, MCMA transfers the ability to abstract and manage memory by transferring the memory copilot.

Current methods rely on coarse, end-to-end evaluation signals and lack fine-grained signals on where to refine, often resulting in inefficient or low-impact modifications. To address these limitations, we propose {\\our{}}, an Evaluation-Judge-Optimization-Update pipeline. We incorporate reusable, configurable logic blocks into agentic workflows to capture fundamental forms of logic. On top of this abstraction, we design a dedicated Judge module that inspects execution traces -- particularly failed runs -- and assigns rank-based responsibility scores to problematic blocks. These fine-grained diagnostic signals are then leveraged by an LLM-based optimizer, which focuses modifications on the most problematic block in the workflow.

Existing methods typically fall into two paradigms: step-wise planning, which is reactive but often short-sighted; and one-shot planning, which generates a complete plan upfront yet is brittle to execution errors. Crucially, both paradigms suffer from entangled contexts, where the agent must reason over a monolithic history spanning multiple sub-tasks. This entanglement increases cognitive load and lets local errors propagate across otherwise independent decisions, making recovery computationally expensive. To address this, we propose Task-Decoupled Planning (TDP), a training-free framework that replaces entangled reasoning with task decoupling. TDP decomposes tasks into a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of sub-goals via a Supervisor. Using a Planner and Executor with scoped contexts, TDP confines reasoning and replanning to the active sub-task. This isolation prevents error propagation and corrects deviations locally without disrupting the workflow. Results on TravelPlanner, ScienceWorld, and HotpotQA show that TDP outperforms strong baselines while reducing token consumption by up to 82%, demonstrating that sub-task decoupling improves both robustness and efficiency for long-horizon agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 Task-Decoupled Planning (TDP)\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacc4\ud68d \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5 \uc2e4\ud589\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc778\uc9c0 \ubd80\ub2f4\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uace0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc2e4\ud589\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uacc4\ud68d\uc774 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc8fc\uc694 Bottleneck\uc73c\ub85c \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "TDP\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 Supervisor\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc131 \ube44\uc21c\ud658 \uadf8\ub798\ud504(DAG)\uc758 \ud558\uc704 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\uace0, \ubc94\uc704\uac00 \uc124\uc815\ub41c \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub85c \ube14\ub798\ub108\uc640 \uc2e4\ud589\uae30\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud65c\uc131 \ud558\uc704 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\ub9cc \uc0ac\uace0 \ubc0f \uc7ac\uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uad6d\ud55c\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "result": "TravelPlanner, ScienceWorld, HotpotQA\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 TDP\uac00 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uae30\uc900\uc120\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud558\uba70, \ud1a0\ud070 \uc18c\ube44\ub97c \ucd5c\ub300 82%\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc904\uc600\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ud558\uc704 \uc791\uc5c5 \ubd84\ub9ac\ub294 \uc7a5\uae30\uac04 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uac15\uac74\uc131\uacfc \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ubaa8\ub450 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud558\uace0 \uc7a5\uae30\uc801\uc778 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud588\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc218\ud589\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uacc4\ud68d\uc774 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc8fc\uc694 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e8\uacc4\ubcc4 \uacc4\ud68d\uacfc \uc6d0\uc0f7 \uacc4\ud68d \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc5d0 \uc18d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e8\uacc4\ubcc4 \uacc4\ud68d\uc740 \ubc18\uc751\uc801\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc885\uc885 \ub2e8\uae30\uc801\uc774\uba70, \uc6d0\uc0f7 \uacc4\ud68d\uc740 \ucc98\uc74c\ubd80\ud130 \uc644\uc804\ud55c \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc2e4\ud589 \uc624\ub958\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ubbfc\uac10\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub450 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784 \ubaa8\ub450 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ud558\uc704 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \ub2e8\uc77c\ud55c \uc774\ub825\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ubbc0\ub85c \uc5bd\ud78c \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5bd\ud798\uc740 \uc778\uc9c0\uc801 \ubd80\ub2f4\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc801 \uc624\ub958\uac00 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \uacb0\uc815\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc804\ud30c\ub418\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\uc5ec \uc218\uc815\uc744 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ube44\uc2f8\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4ed\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 TDP(\uc791\uc5c5 \ubd84\ub9ac \uacc4\ud68d)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Many multi-agent systems simulate human roles at a surface level, missing the underlying criteria that lead experts to assess complementary intellectual aspects of a paper. Moreover, prior methods implicitly assume identified weaknesses are valid, ignoring reviewer bias, misunderstanding, and the critical role of author rebuttals in validating review quality. Finally, most systems output unranked weakness lists, rather than prioritizing the most consequential issues for users. In this work, we propose DIAGPaper, a novel multi-agent framework that addresses these challenges through three tightly integrated modules. The customizer module simulates human-defined review criteria and instantiates multiple reviewer agents with criterion-specific expertise. The rebuttal module introduces author agents that engage in structured debate with reviewer agents to validate and refine proposed weaknesses. The prioritizer module learns from large-scale human review practices to assess the severity of validated weaknesses and surfaces the top-K severest ones to users. Experiments on two benchmarks, AAAR and ReviewCritique, demonstrate that DIAGPaper substantially outperforms existing methods by producing more valid and more paper-specific weaknesses, while presenting them in a user-oriented, prioritized manner.", "AI": {"tldr": "DIAGPaper\ub294 \ub17c\ubb38\uc758 \uc57d\uc810\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574

(2025) to show that LRMs will do just this: they will flatly deny relying on hints provided in the prompt in answering multiple choice questions -- even when directly asked to reflect on unusual (i.e. hinted) prompt content, even when allowed to use hints, and even though experiments *show* them to be using the hints. Our results thus have discouraging implications for CoT monitoring and interpretability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub378(LRMs)\uc774 \uc785\ub825\uc758 \ud2b9\uc815 \ubd80\ubd84\uc774 \uadf8\ub4e4\uc758 \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc790\ubc1c\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub9d0\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc0dd\ub7b5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uacfc \uac70\uc9d3\ub9d0\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ub2e4\ub978 \ubb38\uc81c\ub77c\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LRMs\uac00 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc0dd\ub7b5\uacfc \uac70\uc9d3\ub9d0\uc758 \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \uba85\ud655\ud788 \uc774\ud574\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud568\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "Chen et al.
