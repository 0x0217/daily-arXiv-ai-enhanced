We point\nout two possible pitfalls that might be caused by increasing complexity;\nsusceptibilities to faults, and performance bottlenecks. To prevent the former\nthreat, we propose a transaction-based framework to design very complex\nmulti-agent systems (VCMAS). To address the second threat, we offer to\nintegrate transaction scheduling into the proposed framework. We implemented\nboth of these ideas to develop the OptiMA framework and show that it is able to\nfacilitate the execution of VCMAS with more than a hundred agents. We also\ndemonstrate the effect of transaction scheduling on such a system by showing\nimprovements up to more than 16\\%. Furthermore, we also performed a theoretical\nanalysis on the transaction scheduling problem and provided practical tools\nthat can be used for future research on it.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uba40\ud2f0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131 \uc99d\uac00\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uac70\ub798 \uae30\ubc18 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \uc774\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569 \uac70\ub798 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\ub9c1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud55c OptiMA \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud588\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub354 \ud06c\uace0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uba40\ud2f0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc73c\ub85c \uc5f0\uad6c\uac00 \uc9c4\ud589\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uac70\ub798 \uae30\ubc18 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0 \uac70\ub798 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\ub9c1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud588\ub2e4.", "result": "OptiMA \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 100\uac1c \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c VCMAS\uc758 \uc2e4\ud589\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uba70, \uac70\ub798 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\ub9c1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 16% \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uac70\ub798 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\ub9c1 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc774\ub860 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uace0, \ud5a5\ud6c4 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud588\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc \uba87 \ub144 \ub3d9\uc548 \uba40\ud2f0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub354 \ud06c\uace0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc73c\ub85c \ubc1c\uc804\ud574 \uc654\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801\uc778 \ud568\uc815\uc744 \uc9c0\uc801\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud558\ub098\ub294 \uacb0\ud568\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubbfc\uac10\uc131\uc774\uace0 \ub2e4\ub978 \ud558\ub098\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \uc704\ud611\uc744 \ubc29\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uba40\ud2f0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(VCMAS)\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uac70\ub798 \uae30\ubc18 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub450 \ubc88\uc9f8 \uc704\ud611\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0 \uac70\ub798 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\ub9c1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud560 \uac83\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc544\uc774\ub514\uc5b4\ub97c \uad6c\ud604\ud558\uc5ec OptiMA \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 100\uac1c \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 VCMAS\uc758 \uc2e4\ud589\uc744 \uc6a9\uc774\ud558\uac8c \ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac70\ub798 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\ub9c1\uc774 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc5ec 16% \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub098\uc544\uac00 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac70\ub798 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\ub9c1 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc774\ub860 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \ud5a5\ud6c4 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Existing optimization methods, however, rely on\ntime-consuming manual tuning or resource-intensive black-box searches, which\nstruggle to keep pace with the rapidly evolving LLM domain, leading to slow\ndevelopment and underutilized resources. To address this, we introduce ASAP, an\nAgentic Solution to Auto-optimize Performance of Large-Scale LLM Training. It\nis a multi-agent system, featuring Coordinator, Analyzer, and Proposal agents,\nwhich integrates LLM reasoning with insights from performance profiling tools,\nroofline analysis, and a knowledge base of best practices and successful past\noptimizations from human experts. Our proposed design can automate the\ndiagnosis of performance bottlenecks and recommend optimized sharding\nconfigurations with reasoning, thus effectively improving the efficiency of\ndistributed LLM training. Experiments have shown that the ASAP-generated\nsharding configurations can contribute up to 28% training step time reduction\nand 1.43 times throughput improvement.

While pre-trained\ntransformer-based language models have significantly advanced natural language\ngeneration, they often struggle to precisely control problem complexity and\ncognitive demands. In this paper, we introduce a collaborative multi-agent\nframework as a novel method of incorporating inference-time computation into\nAQG. This approach leverages multiple agents that iteratively refine generated\nquestion-answer pairs to better balance complexity and cognitive demand. We\nevaluate the generated questions on five meta-evaluation criteria: relevance,\nimportance, clarity, difficulty matching, answerability, to assess the system's\nability to control the required complexity and quality of the questions.\nPreliminary evaluations show that this collaborative multi-agent framework\nelevates the quality of generated educational content by fostering a more\nnuanced balance between cognitive challenge and clarity. These promising\noutcomes suggest that integrating collaborative multi-agent workflows can yield\nmore controlled, pedagogically valuable content that can help advance automated\neducational content generation and adaptive learning environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud611\uc5c5 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc218\ud559 \uad50\uc721\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc790\ub3d9 \uc9c8\ubb38 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc218\ud559 \uad50\uc721\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc790\ub3d9 \uc9c8\ubb38 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc9c0\ub2a5\ud615 \ud29c\ud130\ub9c1 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uacfc \uad50\uc721\uc790\ub4e4\uc5d0\uac8c \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud611\uc5c5 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc\uac04 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc744 AQG\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uace0, \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \uc9c8\ubb38-\ub2f5\ubcc0 \uc30d\uc744 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac1c\uc120\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub2e4\uc12f \uac00\uc9c0 \uba54\ud0c0 \ud3c9\uac00 \uae30\uc900(\uc801\ud569\uc131, \uc911\uc694\uc131, \uba85\ud655\uc131, \ub09c\uc774\ub3c4 \uc77c\uce58, \uc751\ub2f5 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131)\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \uc9c8\ubb38\uc758 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ud611\uc5c5 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc778\uc9c0\uc801 \ub3c4\uc804\uacfc \uba85\ud655\uc131 \uc0ac\uc774\uc758 \ubbf8\ubb18\ud55c \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\uc5ec \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \uad50\uc721 \ucf58\ud150\uce20\uc758 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \ub192\uc778\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc790\ub3d9 \uc9c8\ubb38 \uc0dd\uc131(AQG)\uc740 \uc9c0\ub2a5\ud615 \ud29c\ud130\ub9c1 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uacfc \uad50\uc721\uc790\ub4e4\uc5d0\uac8c \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ubcc0\ud658\uae30 \uae30\ubc18 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ubc1c\uc804\uc2dc\ucf30\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubb38\uc81c\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uacfc \uc778\uc9c0\uc801 \uc694\uad6c\ub97c \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \uc81c\uc5b4\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 AQG\uc5d0 \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc\uac04 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c \ud611\uc5c5 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \uc9c8\ubb38-\ub2f5\ubcc0 \uc30d\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uacfc \uc778\uc9c0\uc801 \uc694\uad6c\ub97c \ub354 \uc798 \uade0\ud615 \uc7a1\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \ub2e4\uc12f \uac00\uc9c0 \uba54\ud0c0 \ud3c9\uac00 \uae30\uc900(\uc801\ud569\uc131, \uc911\uc694\uc131, \uba85\ud655\uc131, \ub09c\uc774\ub3c4 \uc77c\uce58, \uc751\ub2f5 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc5ec \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uacfc \uc9c8\ubb38\uc758 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \uc81c\uc5b4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd08\uae30 \ud3c9\uac00\ub294 \uc774 \ud611\uc5c5 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 \uc778\uc9c0\uc801 \ub3c4\uc804\uacfc \uba85\ud655\uc131 \uc0ac\uc774\uc758 \ub354 \ubbf8\ubb18\ud55c \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\uc5ec \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \uad50\uc721 \ucf58\ud150\uce20\uc758 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ud611\uc5c5 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0 \ud1b5\ud569\uc774 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc81c\uc5b4\uac00 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uad50\uc721\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac00\uce58 \uc788\ub294 \ucf58\ud150\uce20\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9 \uad50\uc721 \ucf58\ud150\uce20 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubc0f \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud658\uacbd\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

To address these challenges, we\nintroduce DreamGym, the first unified framework designed to synthesize diverse\nexperiences with scalability in mind to enable effective online RL training for\nautonomous agents. Rather than relying on expensive real-environment rollouts,\nDreamGym distills environment dynamics into a reasoning-based experience model\nthat derives consistent state transitions and feedback signals through\nstep-by-step reasoning, enabling scalable agent rollout collection for RL. To\nimprove the stability and quality of transitions, DreamGym leverages an\nexperience replay buffer initialized with offline real-world data and\ncontinuously enriched with fresh interactions to actively support agent\ntraining. To improve knowledge acquisition, DreamGym adaptively generates new\ntasks that challenge the current agent policy, enabling more effective online\ncurriculum learning. Experiments across diverse environments and agent\nbackbones demonstrate that DreamGym substantially improves RL training, both in\nfully synthetic settings and in sim-to-real transfer scenarios. On non-RL-ready\ntasks like WebArena, DreamGym outperforms all baselines by over 30%. And in\nRL-ready but costly settings, it matches GRPO and PPO performance using only\nsynthetic interactions. When transferring a policy trained purely on synthetic\nexperiences to real-environment RL, DreamGym yields significant additional\nperformance gains while requiring far fewer real-world interactions, providing\na scalable warm-start strategy for general-purpose RL.", "AI": {"tldr": "DreamGym\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uacbd\ud5d8\uc744 \ud569\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL) \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \ud1b5\ud569 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc758 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801 \ucc44\ud0dd\uc740 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4dc\ub294 \ub864\uc544\uc6c3, \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc791\uc5c5 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131, \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc2e0\ud638, \uc778\ud504\ub77c \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "DreamGym\uc740 \ud658\uacbd \ub3d9\ub825\uc744 Reasoning \uae30\ubc18 \uacbd\ud5d8 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c \uc99d\ub958\ud558\uc5ec \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc804\uc774 \ubc0f \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uace0, \uacbd\ud5d8 \uc7ac\uc0dd \ubc84\ud37c\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud658\uacbd \ubc0f \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubc31\ubcf8\uc5d0\uc11c DreamGym\uc740 RL \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \ud68d\uae30\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uba70, \ube44 RL \uc900\ube44 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc744 30% \uc774\uc0c1 \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\uace0, RL \uc900\ube44\uc9c0\ub9cc \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub192\uc740 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 GRPO \ubc0f PPO \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub9de\ucd98\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "DreamGym\uc740 \uc9c4\uc815\ud55c \ud658\uacbd RL\ub85c \uc21c\uc218\ud558\uac8c \ud569\uc131 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc804\uc774\ud560 \ub54c \ud070 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0, \ud6e8\uc52c \uc801\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\uc5ec \uc77c\ubc18 \ubaa9\uc801\uc758 RL\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc6dc \uc2a4\ud0c0\ud2b8 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc740 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc790\uae30 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uac15\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4dc\ub294 \ub864\uc544\uc6c3, \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc791\uc5c5 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131, \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc2e0\ud638 \ubc0f \uc778\ud504\ub77c \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \ucc44\ud0dd\uc774 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \uc0c1\ud669\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uacbd\ud5d8\uc744 \ud569\uc131\ud558\uace0 \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc744 \uc5fc\ub450\uc5d0 \ub450\uace0 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \ud1b5\ud569 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 DreamGym\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.

Among the various forms\nof user interaction, comments play a vital role in fostering community\nparticipation and enabling content re-creation. However, generating comments\nthat are both compliant with platform guidelines and capable of exhibiting\nstylistic diversity and contextual awareness remains a significant challenge.\nWe introduce LOLGORITHM, a modular multi-agent system (MAS) designed for\ncontrollable short-video comment generation. The system integrates video\nsegmentation, contextual and affective analysis, and style-aware prompt\nconstruction. It supports six distinct comment styles: puns (homophones),\nrhyming, meme application, sarcasm (irony), plain humor, and content\nextraction. Powered by a multimodal large language model (MLLM), LOLGORITHM\ndirectly processes video inputs and achieves fine-grained style control through\nexplicit prompt markers and few-shot examples. To support development and\nevaluation, we construct a bilingual dataset using official APIs from Douyin\n(Chinese) and YouTube (English), covering five popular video genres: comedy\nskits, daily life jokes, funny animal clips, humorous commentary, and talk\nshows. Evaluation combines automated metrics originality, relevance, and style\nconformity with a large-scale human preference study involving 40 videos and\n105 participants.

Differentially private pixelization offers mathematically\nguaranteed protection for visual data through grid-based noise addition, but\nchallenges remain in preserving task-relevant fidelity, achieving scalability,\nand enabling efficient real-time deployment. To address this, we propose a\nnovel parallel, region-adaptive pixelization framework that combines the\ntheoretical rigor of differential privacy with practical efficiency. Our method\nadaptively adjusts grid sizes and noise scales based on regional complexity,\nleveraging GPU parallelism to achieve significant runtime acceleration compared\nto the classical baseline. A lightweight storage scheme is introduced by\nretaining only essential noisy statistics, significantly reducing space\noverhead. Formal privacy analysis is provided under the Laplace mechanism and\nparallel composition theorem. Extensive experiments on the PETS, Venice-2, and\nPPM-100 datasets demonstrate favorable privacy-utility trade-offs and\nsignificant runtime/storage reductions. A face re-identification attack\nexperiment on CelebA further confirms the method's effectiveness in preventing\nidentity inference. This validates its suitability for real-time\nprivacy-critical applications such as elderly care, smart home monitoring,\ndriver behavior analysis, and crowd behavior monitoring.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ube44\ub514\uc624 \uae30\ubc18 \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc758 \uac1c\uc778\uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubcd1\ub82c \uc9c0\uc5ed \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ud53d\uc140\ud654 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uace0\ud574\uc0c1\ub3c4 \uc2dc\uac01 \uc13c\uc2f1 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \ubc30\ud3ec\uc640 \uae30\ubcf8 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc0c1\uc2b9\uc740 \ube44\ub514\uc624 \uae30\ubc18 \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc758 \uac1c\uc778\uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ucf30\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc9c0\uc5ed \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uadf8\ub9ac\ub4dc \ud06c\uae30\uc640 \ub178\uc774\uc988 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\uc744 \uc801\uc808\ud558\uac8c \uc870\uc815\ud558\uace0, GPU \ubcd1\ub82c\uc131\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc804\ud1b5 \uae30\ubc18\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud574 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc2e4\ud589 \uc2dc\uac04 \uac00\uc18d\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "PETS, Venice-2 \ubc0f PPM-100 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc740 \uac1c\uc778\uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638\uc640 \uc720\uc6a9\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \uc720\ub9ac\ud55c \uc808\ucda9\uc548\uacfc \uc2e4\ud589 \uc2dc\uac04/\uc800\uc7a5 \uacf5\uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uac10\uc18c\ub97c \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ub178\uc778\uc744 \ub3cc\ubd04, \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \ud648 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1, \uc6b4\uc804 \ud589\ub3d9 \ubd84\uc11d \ubc0f \uad70\uc911 \ud589\ub3d9 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \uac1c\uc778\uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638\uac00 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc5d0 \uc801\ud569\ud568\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uace0\ud574\uc0c1\ub3c4 \uc2dc\uac01 \uc13c\uc2f1 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \ubc30\ud3ec\uc640 \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ucd9c\ud604\uc740 \ube44\ub514\uc624 \uae30\ubc18 \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c \uac1c\uc778\uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ucf30\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucc28\ubd84 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc \ud53d\uc140\ud654\ub294 \uadf8\ub9ac\ub4dc \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ub178\uc774\uc988 \ucd94\uac00\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2dc\uac01 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc218\ud559\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\uc7a5\ub41c \ubcf4\ud638\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc791\uc5c5 \uad00\ub828 \ucda9\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uace0, \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \ubc30\uce58\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ub3c4\uc804\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ucc28\ubd84 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc\uc758 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc5c4\ubc00\uc131\uacfc \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubcd1\ub82c \uc9c0\uc5ed \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ud53d\uc140\ud654 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc9c0\uc5ed \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uadf8\ub9ac\ub4dc \ud06c\uae30\uc640 \ub178\uc774\uc988 \ud06c\uae30\ub97c \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc815\ud558\uba70, GPU \ubcd1\ub82c\uc131\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uae30\uc900\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc2e4\ud589 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \ub2e8\ucd95\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc778 \ub178\uc774\uc988 \ud1b5\uacc4\ub9cc\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ub7c9 \uc800\uc7a5 \uc2a4\ud0b4\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uacf5\uac04 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c \ud06c\uac8c \uc904\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, the target updates in DQN often rely on\nnext states generated by actions from past, potentially suboptimal, policy. As\na result, these states may not provide informative learning signals, causing\nhigh variance into the update process. This issue is exacerbated when the\nsampled transitions are poorly aligned with the agent's current policy. To\naddress this limitation, we propose the Successor-state Aggregation Deep\nQ-Network (SADQ), which explicitly models environment dynamics using a\nstochastic transition model. SADQ integrates successor-state distributions into\nthe Q-value estimation process, enabling more stable and policy-aligned value\nupdates.

As a\nresult, we present \\textit{Telemetry Complexity Attacks} (TCAs), a new class of\nvulnerabilities that exploit fundamental mismatches between unbounded\ncollection mechanisms and bounded processing capabilities. Our method\nrecursively spawns child processes to generate specially crafted, deeply\nnested, and oversized telemetry that stresses serialization and storage\nboundaries, as well as visualization layers, for example, JSON/BSON depth and\nsize limits. Depending on the product, this leads to truncated or missing\nbehavioral reports, rejected database inserts, serializer recursion and size\nerrors, and unresponsive dashboards. In all of these cases, malicious activity\nis normally executed; however, depending on the examined solution, it is not\nrecorded and/or not presented to the analysts. Therefore, instead of evading\nsensors, we break the pipeline that stores the data captured by the sensors.\n  We evaluate our technique against twelve commercial and open-source malware\nanalysis platforms and endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions. Seven\nproducts fail in different stages of the telemetry pipeline; two vendors\nassigned CVE identifiers (CVE-2025-61301 and CVE-2025-61303), and others issued\npatches or configuration changes.

Cooperation\nunfolds through a two-phase negotiation protocol: agents first propose\ncandidate roles with reasoning and then commit to a joint allocation under\nconsensus and environment constraints. After commitment, each agent\nindependently generates and executes a symbolic plan for its role without\nrevealing detailed trajectories. Plans are grounded in execution outcomes via a\nshared world model that encodes the current state and is updated as agents act.\nBy reasoning over symbolic plans rather than raw trajectories, DR. WELL avoids\nbrittle step-level alignment and enables higher-level operations that are\nreusable, synchronizable, and interpretable. Experiments on cooperative\nblock-push tasks show that agents adapt across episodes, with the dynamic world\nmodel capturing reusable patterns and improving task completion rates and\nefficiency. Experiments on cooperative block-push tasks show that our dynamic\nworld model improves task completion and efficiency through negotiation and\nself-refinement, trading a time overhead for evolving, more efficient\ncollaboration strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "DR.

This study aims to\ndevelop and evaluate a deep learning model based on a pretrained ResNet\narchitecture for automated detection of appendicitis from ultrasound images. We\nused the Regensburg Pediatric Appendicitis Dataset, which includes ultrasound\nscans, laboratory data, and clinical scores from pediatric patients admitted\nwith abdominal pain to Children Hospital. Hedwig in Regensburg, Germany. Each\nsubject had 1 to 15 ultrasound views covering the right lower quadrant,\nappendix, lymph nodes, and related structures. For the image based\nclassification task, ResNet was fine tuned to distinguish appendicitis from\nnon-appendicitis cases.

Sheppard"], "title": "Decomposable Neuro Symbolic Regression", "comment": null, "summary": "Symbolic regression (SR) models complex systems by discovering mathematical\nexpressions that capture underlying relationships in observed data. However,\nmost SR methods prioritize minimizing prediction error over identifying the\ngoverning equations, often producing overly complex or inaccurate expressions.\nTo address this, we present a decomposable SR method that generates\ninterpretable multivariate expressions leveraging transformer models, genetic\nalgorithms (GAs), and genetic programming (GP). In particular, our explainable\nSR method distills a trained ``opaque'' regression model into mathematical\nexpressions that serve as explanations of its computed function. Our method\nemploys a Multi-Set Transformer to generate multiple univariate symbolic\nskeletons that characterize how each variable influences the opaque model's\nresponse. We then evaluate the generated skeletons' performance using a\nGA-based approach to select a subset of high-quality candidates before\nincrementally merging them via a GP-based cascade procedure that preserves\ntheir original skeleton structure.

Although recent theoretical studies have\nestablished the SLTH across various neural architectures, the SLTH for\ntransformer architectures still lacks theoretical understanding. In particular,\nthe current theory of the SLTH does not yet account for the multi-head\nattention (MHA) mechanism, a core component of transformers. To address this\ngap, we introduce a theoretical analysis of the existence of SLTs within MHAs.\nWe prove that, if a randomly initialized MHA of $H$ heads and input dimension\n$d$ has the hidden dimension $O(d\\log(Hd^{3/2}))$ for the key and value, it\ncontains an SLT that approximates an arbitrary MHA with the same input\ndimension with high probability. Furthermore, by leveraging this theory for\nMHAs, we extend the SLTH to transformers without normalization layers. We\nempirically validate our theoretical findings, demonstrating that the\napproximation error between the SLT within a source model (MHA and transformer)\nand an approximate target counterpart decreases exponentially by increasing the\nhidden dimension of the source model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uac15\ud55c \ubcf5\uad8c \ud2f0\ucf13 \uac00\uc124(SLTH)\uc740 \uc784\uc758\ub85c

While existing computational methods primarily aim to generate\nlarge ensembles of legally valid districting plans, they often neglect the\nstrategic dynamics involved in the selection process. This oversight creates\nopportunities for partisan actors to cherry-pick maps that, while technically\ncompliant, are politically advantageous. Simply satisfying formal constraints\ndoes not ensure fairness when the selection process itself can be manipulated.\nWe propose \\textbf{Agentmandering}, a framework that reimagines redistricting\nas a turn-based negotiation between two agents representing opposing political\ninterests. Drawing inspiration from game-theoretic ideas, particularly the\n\\textit{Choose-and-Freeze} protocol, our method embeds strategic interaction\ninto the redistricting process via large language model (LLM) agents. Agents\nalternate between selecting and freezing districts from a small set of\ncandidate maps, gradually partitioning the state through constrained and\ninterpretable choices. Evaluation on post-2020 U.S. Census data across all\nstates shows that Agentmandering significantly reduces partisan bias and\nunfairness, while achieving 2 to 3 orders of magnitude lower variance than\nstandard baselines. These results demonstrate both fairness and stability,\nespecially in swing-state scenarios.

Under preparation for submission to ICML 2026. Feedback\n  welcome", "summary": "We introduce Complexity as Advantage (CAA), a framework that defines the\ncomplexity of a system relative to a family of observers. Instead of measuring\ncomplexity as an intrinsic property, we evaluate how much predictive regret a\nsystem induces for different observers attempting to model it. A system is\ncomplex when it is easy for some observers and hard for others, creating an\ninformation advantage. We show that this formulation unifies several notions of\nemergent behavior, including multiscale entropy, predictive information, and\nobserver-dependent structure. The framework suggests that \"interesting\" systems\nare those positioned to create differentiated regret across observers,\nproviding a quantitative grounding for why complexity can be functionally\nvaluable.

Our methodology addresses the\nfundamental dual challenge of testing platforms: generating realistic test\nconversations (simulation quality) and accurately evaluating agent responses\n(evaluation quality). The framework combines established psychometric\ntechniques (pairwise comparisons yielding Elo ratings, bootstrap confidence\nintervals, and permutation tests) with rigorous statistical validation to\nprovide reproducible metrics applicable to any testing approach.\n  To validate the framework and demonstrate its utility, we conducted\ncomprehensive empirical evaluation of three leading commercial platforms\nfocused on Voice AI Testing using 21,600 human judgments across 45 simulations\nand ground truth validation on 60 conversations. Results reveal statistically\nsignificant performance differences with the proposed framework, with the\ntop-performing platform, Evalion, achieving 0.92 evaluation quality measured as\nf1-score versus 0.73 for others, and 0.61 simulation quality using a league\nbased scoring system (including ties) vs 0.43 for other platforms.\n  This framework enables researchers and organizations to empirically validate\nthe testing capabilities of any platform, providing essential measurement\nfoundations for confident voice AI deployment at scale.

We show that an agent can learn to solve\ntasks by selecting its own goals in an environment-agnostic way, at training\ntimes comparable to externally guided reinforcement learning. Our method is\nindependent of the underlying off-policy learning algorithm. Since our method\nis environment-agnostic, the agent does not value any goals higher than others,\nleading to instability in performance for individual goals. However, in our\nexperiments, we show that the average goal success rate improves and\nstabilizes. An agent trained with this method can be instructed to seek any\nobservations made in the environment, enabling generic training of agents prior\nto specific use cases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc870\uac74 \ud658\uacbd\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud559\uc2b5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc2a4\uc2a4\ub85c \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uc120\ud0dd\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uc124\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ud2b9\uc815 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc5d0 \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc \ud3c9\uade0 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc774 \uac1c\uc120\ub418\uace0 \uc548\uc815\ud654\ub428\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \uad00\ucc30\uc744 \ucd94\uad6c\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc9c0\uc2dc\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc5b4 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uc0ac\ub840 \uc774\uc804\uc5d0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc870\uac74 \ud658\uacbd\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc5c6\uc774 \ud559\uc2b5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ud658\uacbd \ubb34\uad00\ud558\uac8c \uc2a4\uc2a4\ub85c \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\uc5ec \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ubc95\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc678\ubd80\uc5d0\uc11c \uc548\ub0b4\ub41c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uacfc \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \ud6c8\ub828 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \uc18c\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uc624\ud504 \ud3f4\ub9ac\uc2dc \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc5d0 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \ubb34\uad00\ud558\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc5b4\ub5a4 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub3c4 \ub2e4\ub978 \ubaa9\ud45c\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \ub192\uac8c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uac1c\ubcc4 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ubd88\uc548\uc815\ud574\uc9d1\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc \ud3c9\uade0 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc774 \uac1c\uc120\ub418\uace0 \uc548\uc815\ud654\ub418\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uad00\ucc30\uc744 \ucd94\uad6c\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc9c0\uc2dc\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc5b4, \ud2b9\uc815 \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uc0ac\ub840 \uc774\uc804\uc5d0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

We introduce a\nmulti-agent predictive coding framework that formulate coordination as the\nminimization of mutual uncertainty among agents. Instantiated as an information\nbottleneck objective, it prompts agents to learn not only who and what to\ncommunicate but also when. At the foundation of this framework lies a\ngrid-cell-like metric as internal spatial coding for self-localization,\nemerging spontaneously from self-supervised motion prediction. Building upon\nthis internal spatial code, agents gradually develop a bandwidth-efficient\ncommunication mechanism and specialized neural populations that encode\npartners' locations: an artificial analogue of hippocampal social place cells\n(SPCs). These social representations are further enacted by a hierarchical\nreinforcement learning policy that actively explores to reduce joint\nuncertainty. On the Memory-Maze benchmark, our approach shows exceptional\nresilience to bandwidth constraints: success degrades gracefully from 73.5% to\n64.4% as bandwidth shrinks from 128 to 4 bits/step, whereas a full-broadcast\nbaseline collapses from 67.6% to 28.6%. Our findings establish a theoretically\nprincipled and biologically plausible basis for how complex social\nrepresentations emerge from a unified predictive drive, leading to social\ncollective

To circumvent this, practitioners proposed a class of\nlanguage models called diffusion language models, of which the masked diffusion\nmodel (MDM) is the most successful. The MDM is able to sample tokens\nout-of-order and, ostensibly, many tokens at once and in parallel. However,\nthere is very limited rigorous understanding of how much parallel sampling\nthese models can perform without noticeable degradation in their sampling\nperformance. Prior work of Li and Cai obtained some preliminary bounds, but\nthese are not tight for many natural classes of distributions. In this work, we\ngive a new, exact characterization of the expected divergence between the true\ndistribution and the sampled distribution, for any distribution and any\nunmasking schedule for the sampler, showing an elegant connection to the theory\nof univariate function approximation.\n  By leveraging this connection, we then attain a number of novel lower and\nupper bounds for this problem. While the connection to function approximation\nin principle gives the optimal unmasking schedule for any distribution, we show\nthat it is in general impossible to compete with it without strong a priori\nknowledge of the distribution, even in seemingly benign settings. However, we\nalso demonstrate new upper bounds and new sampling schedules in terms of\nwell-studied information-theoretic properties of the base distribution, namely,\nits total correlation and dual total correlation, which show that in some\nnatural settings, one can sample in $O(log n)$ steps without any visible loss\nin performance, where $n$ is the total sequence length.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ud45c\uc900 \uc790\uae30 \ud68c\uadc0 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc740 \uadf8\ub4e4\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \uacfc\uc815\uc774 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc21c\ucc28\uc801\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc810\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uae34 \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc\uac04\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc2e4\ubb34\uc790\ub4e4\uc740 \ud655\uc0b0 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4, \ud2b9\ud788 \uac00\uc7a5 \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc778 \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud06c \ub4dc\ud4e8\uc804 \ubaa8\ub378(MDM)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.

CUAs present\nunique challenges and is constrained by three persistent gaps: a scarcity of\nreal-world CUA tasks, the lack of automated collection-and-annotation pipelines\nfor multi-modal trajectories, and the absence of a unified benchmark that\njointly evaluates GUI grounding, screen parsing, and action prediction.\n  GUI-360$^\\circ$ addresses these gaps with an LLM-augmented, largely automated\npipeline for query sourcing, environment-template construction, task\ninstantiation, batched execution, and LLM-driven quality filtering. The\nreleased corpus contains over 1.2M executed action steps across thousands of\ntrajectories in popular Windows office applications, and includes\nfull-resolution screenshots, accessibility metadata when available,\ninstantiated goals, intermediate reasoning traces, and both successful and\nfailed action trajectories. The dataset supports three canonical tasks, GUI\ngrounding, screen parsing, and action prediction, and a hybrid GUI+API action\nspace that reflects modern agent designs. Benchmarking state-of-the-art\nvision--language models on GUI-360$^\\circ$ reveals substantial out-of-the-box\nshortcomings in grounding and action prediction; supervised fine-tuning and\nreinforcement learning yield significant gains but do not close the gap to\nhuman-level reliability.

Yet, since they\nwere not originally designed for DM, recent studies show that LLMs can struggle\neven in basic online DM problems, failing to achieve low regret or an effective\nexploration-exploitation tradeoff. To address this, we introduce Iterative\nRegret-Minimization Fine-Tuning (Iterative RMFT), a post-training procedure\nthat repeatedly distills low-regret decision trajectories back into the base\nmodel. At each iteration, the model rolls out multiple decision trajectories,\nselects the k-lowest regret ones, and fine-tunes itself on them. Unlike prior\nmethods that (a) distill action sequences from known DM algorithms or (b) rely\non manually crafted chain-of-thought templates, our approach leverages the\nregret metric to elicit the model's own DM ability and reasoning rationales.\nThis reliance on model-generated reasoning avoids rigid output engineering and\nprovides more flexible, natural-language training signals. Empirical results\nshow that Iterative RMFT improves LLMs' DM performance across diverse models -\nfrom Transformers with numerical input/output, to open-weight LLMs, and\nadvanced closed-weight models like GPT-4o mini. Its flexibility in output and\nreasoning formats enables generalization across tasks with varying horizons,\naction spaces, reward processes, and natural-language contexts. Finally, we\nprovide theoretical insight showing that a single-layer Transformer under this\nparadigm can act as a no-regret learner in a simplified setting. Overall,\nIterative RMFT offers a principled and general post-training framework for\nenhancing LLMs' decision-making capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744

However, they lack the capability to interpret and\nintegrate the complex, semantic, and dynamic contexts of human drivers, such as\nmulti-step tasks, situational constraints, or urgent needs. This paper\nintroduces and evaluates PAVe (Personalized Agentic Vehicular Routing), a\nhybrid agentic assistant designed to augment classical pathfinding algorithms\nwith contextual reasoning. Our approach employs a Large Language Model (LLM)\nagent that operates on a candidate set of routes generated by a multi-objective\n(time, CO2) Dijkstra algorithm. The agent evaluates these options against\nuser-provided tasks, preferences, and avoidance rules by leveraging a\npre-processed geospatial cache of urban Points of Interest (POIs). In a\nbenchmark of realistic urban scenarios, PAVe successfully used complex user\nintent into appropriate route modifications, achieving over 88% accuracy in its\ninitial route selections with a local model. We conclude that combining\nclassical routing algorithms with an LLM-based semantic reasoning layer is a\nrobust and effective approach for creating personalized, adaptive, and scalable\nsolutions for urban mobility optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ucc28\ub7c9 \uacbd\ub85c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc2dc\uac04\uc774\ub098 \uac70\ub9ac \uac19\uc740 \ub2e8\uc77c

Submitted to Nature Water.

While flood\nprediction and monitoring in high spatial-temporal resolution are desired,\npractical constraints in time, budget, and technology hinder its full\nimplementation. How to monitor urban drainage networks and predict flow\nconditions under constrained resource is a major challenge. This study presents\na data-driven sparse sensing (DSS) framework, integrated with EPA-SWMM, to\noptimize sensor placement and reconstruct peak flowrates in a stormwater\nsystem, using the Woodland Avenue catchment in Duluth, Minnesota, as a case\nstudy. We utilized a SWMM model to generate a training dataset of peak flowrate\nprofiles across the stormwater network. Furthermore, we applied DSS -\nleveraging singular value decomposition for dimensionality reduction and QR\nfactorization for sensor allocation - to identify the optimal monitoring nodes\nbased on the simulated training dataset. We then validated the\nrepresentativeness of these identified monitoring nodes by comparing the\nDSS-reconstructed peak flowrate profiles with those obtained from SWMM. Three\noptimally placed sensors among 77 nodes achieved satisfactory reconstruction\nperformance with Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) values of 0.92-0.95 (25th to\n75th percentiles). In addition, the model showed good robustness to uncertainty\nin measurements. Its robustness to sensor failures is location-dependent and\nimproves with the number of sensors deployed. The framework balances\ncomputational efficiency and physical interpretability, enabling high-accuracy\nflow reconstruction with minimal sensors. This DSS framework can be further\nintegrated with predictive models to realize flood early warning and real-time\ncontrol under limited sensing and monitoring resource.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774
