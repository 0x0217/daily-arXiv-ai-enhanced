These approaches, including structured workflows, debate models, and iterative voting, often lead to communication bottlenecks, stringent decision-making processes, and delayed responses in solving complex and evolving tasks. This article introduces a three-tier architecture, the Hierarchical Adaptive Consensus Network (\\hacn), which suggests various consensus policies based on task characterization and agent performance metrics. The first layer collects the confidence-based voting outcomes of several local agent clusters. In contrast, the second level facilitates inter-cluster communication through cross-clustered partial knowledge sharing and dynamic timeouts. The third layer provides system-wide coordination and final arbitration by employing a global orchestration framework with adaptable decision rules. The proposed model achieves $\\bigO(n)$ communication complexity, as opposed to the $\\bigO(n^2)$ complexity of the existing fully connected MAS. Experiments performed in a simulated environment yielded a 99.9\\% reduction in communication overhead during consensus convergence. Furthermore, the proposed approach ensures consensus convergence through hierarchical escalation and dynamic adaptation for a wide variety of complicated tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "3\uacc4\uce35 \uad6c\uc870\uc758 \uc704\uacc4\uc801 \uc801\uc751 \ud569\uc758 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c(HACN)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \ud611\uc5c5 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud569\uc758 \uc804\ub7b5\uc758 \uc801\uc751\uc131, \ud655\uc7a5\uc131 \ubc0f \uc218\ub834 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud611\uc5c5 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud569\uc758 \uc804\ub7b5\uc740 \uc801\uc751\uc131, \ud655\uc7a5\uc131 \ubc0f \uc218\ub834 \ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ub41c \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud569\uc758 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c 3\uacc4\uce35 \uad6c\uc870\uc758 \uc704\uacc4\uc801 \uc801\uc751 \ud569\uc758 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c(HACN)\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574, \uccab\uc9f8\ub85c \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc9c0\uc5ed \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0 \uae30\ubc18 \ud22c\ud45c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc218\uc9d1\ud558\uace0, \ub458\uc9f8\ub85c \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130 \uac04\uc758 \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\uba70, \uc14b\uc9f8\ub85c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc804\uccb4\uc758 \uc870\uc815\uacfc \ucd5c\uc885 \uc911\uc7ac\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc644\uc804 \uc5f0\uacb0\ub41c MAS\uc758 $\bigO(n^2)$ \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 $\bigO(n)$ \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud569\uc758 \uc218\ub834 \uc911 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c 99.9\text{%} \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ucf30\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc704\uacc4\uc801 \uc0c1\uc2b9\uacfc \ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \uc801\uc751\uc131\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud569\uc758 \uc218\ub834\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud611\uc5c5 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(MAS)\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \ud569\uc758 \uc804\ub7b5\uc740 \uc801\uc751\uc131, \ud655\uc7a5\uc131 \ubc0f \uc218\ub834 \ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ub41c \uc8fc\ubaa9\ud560 \ub9cc\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0, \ud1a0\ub860 \ubaa8\ub378 \ubc0f \ubc18\ubcf5 \ud22c\ud45c\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uba70, \uc885\uc885 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1, \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815 \ubc0f \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud558\uace0 \uc9c4\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub530\ub978 \uc9c0\uc5f0\ub41c \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc11c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud2b9\uc131\ud654 \ubc0f \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc131\ub2a5 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud569\uc758 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\ub294 3\uacc4\uce35 \uad6c\uc870\uc778 \uc704\uacc4\uc801 \uc801\uc751 \ud569\uc758 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c(HACN)\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \uce35\uc740 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc9c0\uc5ed \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0 \uae30\ubc18 \ud22c\ud45c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc218\uc9d1\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubc18\uba74, \ub450 \ubc88\uc9f8 \uc218\uc900\uc740 \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130 \uac04\uc758 \ubd80\ubd84 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uacf5\uc720 \ubc0f \ub3d9\uc801 \uc2dc\uac04 \ucd08\uacfc\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130 \uac04 \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc138 \ubc88\uc9f8 \uce35\uc740 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uacb0\uc815 \uaddc\uce59\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uc624\ucf00\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc804\uccb4\uc758 \uc870\uc815 \ubc0f \ucd5c\uc885 \uc911\uc7ac\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc644\uc804 \uc5f0\uacb0\ub41c MAS\uc758 $\bigO(n^2)$ \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 $\bigO(n)$ \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc218\ud589\ub41c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud569\uc758 \uc218\ub834 \uc911 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\uac00 99.9\text{%} \uac10\uc18c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc704\uacc4\uc801 \uc0c1\uc2b9 \ubc0f \ub3d9\uc801 \uc801\uc751\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud569\uc758 \uc218\ub834\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

Traditional coordination mechanisms, such as centralized oversight or adversarial adjudication, struggle to scale and often obscure how decisions emerge. We introduce a market-making framework for multi-agent large language model (LLM) coordination that organizes agent interactions as structured economic exchanges. In this setup, each agent acts as a market participant, updating and trading probabilistic beliefs, to converge toward shared, truthful outcomes. By aligning local incentives with collective epistemic goals, the framework promotes self-organizing, verifiable reasoning without requiring external enforcement. Empirically, we evaluate this approach across factual reasoning, ethical judgment, and commonsense inference tasks. Market-based coordination yields accuracy gains of up to 10% over single-shot baselines while preserving interpretability and transparency of intermediate reasoning steps. Beyond these improvements, our findings demonstrate that economic coordination principles can operationalize accountability and robustness in multi-agent LLM systems, offering a scalable pathway toward self-correcting, socially responsible AI capable of maintaining trust and oversight in real world deployment scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911

Existing coordination methods enable agents to reach consensus without a centralized coordinator, but do not provide formal guarantees on system-level objectives such as efficiency or fairness. To address this limitation, we propose an iterative negotiation and oversight framework that augments a decentralized negotiation mechanism with taxation-like oversight. The framework builds upon the trading auction for consensus, enabling noncooperative agents with conflicting preferences to negotiate through asset trading while preserving valuation privacy. We introduce an oversight mechanism, which implements a taxation-like intervention that guides decentralized negotiation toward system-efficient and equitable outcomes while also regulating how fast the framework converges. We establish theoretical guarantees of finite-time termination and derive bounds linking system efficiency and convergence rate to the level of central intervention. A case study based on the collaborative trajectory options program, a rerouting initiative in U.S. air traffic management, demonstrates that the framework can reliably achieve consensus among noncooperative airspace sector managers, and reveals how the level of intervention regulates the relationship between system efficiency and convergence speed. Taken together, the theoretical and experimental results indicate that the proposed framework provides a general mechanism for decentralized coordination in noncooperative multi-agent systems while safeguarding system-level objectives.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ud0c8\uc911\uc559\ud654\ub41c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \ube44\ud611\uc870\uc801

However, today's language models lack a mechanism for isolating user interactions and concurrent tasks, creating a new attack vector inherent to this new setting: cross-user poisoning (CUP). In a CUP attack, an adversary injects ordinary-looking messages that poison the persistent, shared state, which later triggers the agent to execute unintended, attacker-specified actions on behalf of benign users. We validate CUP on real systems, successfully attacking popular multi-user agents. To study the phenomenon systematically, we present MURMUR, a framework that composes single-user tasks into concurrent, group-based scenarios using an LLM to generate realistic, history-aware user interactions. We observe that CUP attacks succeed at high rates and their effects persist across multiple tasks, thus posing fundamental risks to multi-user LLM deployments. Finally, we introduce a first-step defense with task-based clustering to mitigate this new class of vulnerability", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc5b8\uc5b4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ubcf4\uc870\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ud611\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\ub300\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ubc0f \ub3d9\uc2dc \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uaca9\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uc5ec \uad50\ucc28 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ubcc0\uc870(CUP)\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacf5\uaca9 \ubca1\ud130\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131 \ud655\ubcf4.", "method": "MURMUR\ub77c\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e8\uc77c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc \uadf8\ub8f9 \uae30\ubc18 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub85c \uc870\ud569\ud558\uace0 LLM\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc0ac\uc2e4\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc5ed\uc0ac-aware \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131.", "result": "CUP \uacf5\uaca9\uc774 \ub192\uc740 \ube44\uc728\ub85c \uc131\uacf5\ud558\uace0 \uadf8 \uc601\ud5a5\uc774 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc9c0\uc18d\ub428\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc791\uc5c5 \uae30\ubc18 \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130\ub9c1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc720\ud615\uc758 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uccab \ub2e8\uacc4 \ubc29\uc5b4\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc5b8\uc5b4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ubcf4\uc870\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ud611\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \ube60\ub974\uac8c \ud655\uc7a5\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uacfc \ub3d9\uc2dc \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uaca9\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uad50\ucc28 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ubcc0\uc870(CUP)\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacf5\uaca9 \ubca1\ud130\uac00 \uc0dd\uc131\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.

We posit this failure stems from data corruption creating sharp minima in the loss landscape, leading to poor generalization. To address this, we are the first to apply Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) as a general-purpose, plug-and-play optimizer for offline RL. SAM seeks flatter minima, guiding models to more robust parameter regions. We integrate SAM into strong baselines for data corruption: IQL, a top-performing offline RL algorithm in this setting, and RIQL, an algorithm designed specifically for data-corruption robustness. We evaluate them on D4RL benchmarks with both random and adversarial corruption. Our SAM-enhanced methods consistently and significantly outperform the original baselines.

Building on a previously formalized metric, the Artificial Age Score (AAS), the study maps twenty core propositions from the Monadology to an information-theoretic architecture. In this design, each monad functions as a modular unit defined by a truth score, a redundancy parameter, and a weighted contribution to a global memory penalty function. Smooth logarithmic transformations operationalize these quantities and yield interpretable, bounded metrics for memory aging, representational stability, and salience. Classical metaphysical notions of perception, apperception, and appetition are reformulated as entropy, gradient dynamics, and internal representation fidelity. Logical principles, including the laws of non-contradiction and sufficient reason, are encoded as regularization constraints guiding memory evolution. A central contribution is a set of first principles proofs establishing refinement invariance, structural decomposability, and monotonicity under scale transformation, aligned with the metaphysical structure of monads. The framework's formal organization is structured into six thematic bundles derived from Monadology, aligning each mathematical proof with its corresponding philosophical domain.

We argue that permission-based access control is indispensable in providing meaningful control to the users, but conventional permission models are inadequate for the automated agentic execution paradigm. We therefore propose automated permission management for AI agents. Our key idea is to conduct a user study to identify the factors influencing users' permission decisions and to encode these factors into an ML-based permission management assistant capable of predicting users' future decisions. We find that participants' permission decisions are influenced by communication context but importantly individual preferences tend to remain consistent within contexts, and align with those of other participants. Leveraging these insights, we develop a permission prediction model achieving 85.1% accuracy overall and 94.4% for high-confidence predictions. We find that even without using permission history, our model achieves an accuracy of 66.9%, and a slight increase of training samples (i.e., 1-4) can substantially increase the accuracy by 10.8%.",

To address this issue, we introduce the Binary BPE tokenizer family, a set of cross-platform Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizers for executables trained on a large corpus of binaries spanning multiple platforms, architectures, and operating systems, including Linux, Windows, macOS, Android, and malware sources. We release trained tokenizers with vocabularies of 4K, 8K, 16K, 32K, and 64K tokens, enabling both systematic scaling studies and practical deployment from resource-constrained edge devices to high-throughput datacenters. These tokenizers discover interpretable patterns (ELF/PE headers, instruction sequences, cross-platform strings) while yielding multi-byte compression per token. On representative uncompressed executables (e.g., ELF/PE/Mach-O rather than compressed APKs), the Binary BPE tokenizers typically allow for roughly 2-3x more binary content per fixed-length transformer context window than raw bytes, enabling more efficient research and practical deployment for content identification, malware detection, reverse engineering, and optimization. We release the trained Binary BPE tokenizers on HuggingFace, providing a drop-in, open-source foundation for binary-focused language models and context-efficient agentic tools.", "AI": {"tldr":

Such shortcoming causes vulnerability against visual deceptions, where the models are deceived by generated contents, and the reliability of reasoning processes is jeopardized. Therefore, facing rapidly emerging generative models and diverse data distribution, it is of vital importance to improve LLMs' generalizable reasoning to verify the authenticity of visual inputs against potential deceptions. Inspired by human cognitive processes, we discovered that LLMs exhibit tendency of over-trusting the visual inputs, while injecting skepticism could significantly improve the models visual cognitive capability against visual deceptions. Based on this discovery, we propose \\textbf{Inception}, a fully reasoning-based agentic reasoning framework to conduct generalizable authenticity verification by injecting skepticism, where LLMs' reasoning logic is iteratively enhanced between External Skeptic and Internal Skeptic agents. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first fully reasoning-based framework against AIGC visual deceptions.

This study investigates a fundamental problem in decentralized multi-agent navigation: routing loops, where vehicles without persistent obstacle memory become trapped in cycles of inefficient path recalculation. Through systematic simulation experiments involving 72 unique configurations across varying vehicle densities (15, 35, 55 vehicles) and obstacle frequencies (6, 20 obstacles), we demonstrate that memory-less reactive rerouting increases average travel time by up to 682% compared to baseline conditions. To address this, we introduce Object Memory Management (OMM), a lightweight mechanism enabling agents to retain and share knowledge of previously encountered obstacles. OMM operates by maintaining a distributed blacklist of blocked nodes, which each agent consults during Dijkstra-based path recalculation, effectively preventing redundant routing attempts. Our results show that OMM-enabled coordination reduces average travel time by 75.7% and wait time by 88% compared to memory-less systems, while requiring only 1.67 route recalculations per vehicle versus 9.83 in memory-less scenarios. This work provides empirical evidence that persistent, shared memory is not merely beneficial but essential for robust multi-agent coordination in dynamic environments. The findings have implications beyond autonomous vehicles, informing the design of decentralized systems in robotics, network routing, and distributed AI.

Published in 2025 34th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN), IEEE, August 2025", "summary": "Data streams collected from multiple sources are rarely independent. Values evolve over time and influence one another across sequences. These correlations improve prediction in healthcare, finance, and smart-city control yet violate the record-independence assumption built into most Differential Privacy (DP) mechanisms. To restore rigorous privacy guarantees without sacrificing utility, we introduce Correlated-Sequence Differential Privacy (CSDP), a framework specifically designed for preserving privacy in correlated sequential data. CSDP addresses two linked challenges: quantifying the extra information an attacker gains from joint temporal and cross-sequence links, and adding just enough noise to hide that information while keeping the data useful. We model multivariate streams as a Coupling Markov Chain, yielding the derived loose leakage bound expressed with a few spectral terms and revealing a counterintuitive result: stronger coupling can actually decrease worst-case leakage by dispersing perturbations across sequences. Guided by these bounds, we build the Freshness-Regulated Adaptive Noise (FRAN) mechanism--combining data aging, correlation-aware sensitivity scaling, and Laplace noise--that runs in linear time.

We introduce Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL), a modular architecture that explicitly separates agent cognition into five phases: Retrieval, Cognition, Control, Action, and Memory (R-CCAM). At the core of SCL is Soft Symbolic Control, an adaptive governance mechanism that applies symbolic constraints to probabilistic inference, preserving neural flexibility while restoring the explainability and controllability of classical symbolic systems. Through empirical validation on multi-step conditional reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that SCL achieves zero policy violations, eliminates redundant tool calls, and maintains complete decision traceability. These results address critical gaps in existing frameworks such as ReAct, AutoGPT, and memory-augmented approaches. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we situate SCL within the taxonomy of hybrid intelligence, differentiating it from prompt-centric and memory-only approaches; (2) we formally define Soft Symbolic Control and contrast it with neuro-symbolic AI; and (3) we derive three design principles for trustworthy agents: modular decomposition, adaptive symbolic governance, and transparent state management. We provide a complete open-source implementation demonstrating the R-CCAM loop architecture, alongside a live GPT-4o-powered travel planning agent. By connecting expert system principles with modern LLM capabilities, this work offers a practical and theoretically grounded path toward reliable, explainable, and governable AI agents.

Unlike traditional software, AI agents leverage LLMs as their \"brain\" to autonomously perform actions via connected tools. This capability introduces significant risks that go far beyond those of harmful text presented in a chatbot that was the main application of LLMs. A compromised AI agent can deliberately abuse powerful tools to perform malicious actions, in many cases irreversible, and limited solely by the guardrails on the tools themselves and the LLM ability to enforce them. This paper presents ASTRA, a first-of-its-kind framework designed to evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in supporting the creation of secure agents that enforce custom guardrails defined at the system-prompt level (e.g., \"Do not send an email out of the company domain,\" or \"Never extend the robotic arm in more than 2 meters\").\n  Our holistic framework simulates 10 diverse autonomous agents varying between a coding assistant and a delivery drone equipped with 37 unique tools. We test these agents against a suite of novel attacks developed specifically for agentic threats, inspired by the OWASP Top 10 but adapted to challenge the ability of the LLM for policy enforcement during multi-turn planning and execution of strict tool activation. By evaluating 13 open-source, tool-calling LLMs, we uncovered surprising and significant differences in their ability to remain secure and keep operating within their boundaries. The purpose of this work is to provide the community with a robust and unified methodology to build and validate better LLMs, ultimately pushing for more secure and reliable agentic AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 LLM(\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378)\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8ec\ub2e4.

Although graph neural networks that leverage neuroimaging data have shown promise in depression diagnosis, existing approaches are predominantly data-driven and operate largely as black-box models, lacking neurobiological interpretability. Here, we present NH-GCAT (Neurocircuitry-Inspired Hierarchical Graph Causal Attention Networks), a novel framework that bridges neuroscience domain knowledge with deep learning by explicitly and hierarchically modeling depression-specific mechanisms at different spatial scales. Our approach introduces three key technical contributions: (1) at the local brain regional level, we design a residual gated fusion module that integrates temporal blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) dynamics with functional connectivity patterns, specifically engineered to capture local depression-relevant low-frequency neural oscillations; (2) at the multi-regional circuit level, we propose a hierarchical circuit encoding scheme that aggregates regional node representations following established depression neurocircuitry organization, and (3) at the multi-circuit network level, we develop a variational latent causal attention mechanism that leverages a continuous probabilistic latent space to infer directed information flow among critical circuits, characterizing disease-altered whole-brain inter-circuit interactions. Rigorous leave-one-site-out cross-validation on the REST-meta-MDD dataset demonstrates NH-GCAT's state-of-the-art performance in depression classification, achieving a sample-size weighted-average accuracy of 73.3\\% and an AUROC of 76.4\\%, while simultaneously providing neurobiologically meaningful explanations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc6b0\uc6b8\uc99d \uc9c4\ub2e8\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e0\uacbd\uacfc\ud559 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd \uae30\ubc18\uc758 NH-GCAT \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc6b0\uc6b8\uc99d\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ud751\ubc15\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e0\uacbd\uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801 \ud574\uc11d\ub825\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "NH-GCAT\ub294 \uc6b0\uc6b8\uc99d \uad00\ub828 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uacf5\uac04\uc801 \uaddc\ubaa8\uc5d0\uc11c \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uacc4\uce35\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "REST-meta-MDD \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucca0\uc800\ud55c \uad50\ucc28\uac80\uc99d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 NH-GCAT\uc774 73.3%\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc640 76.4%\uc758 AUROC\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "NH-GCAT\uc740 \uc6b0\uc6b8\uc99d \ubd84\ub958\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud558\uba70 \uc2e0\uacbd\uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc758\ubbf8 \uc788\ub294 \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc8fc\uc694 \uc6b0\uc6b8 \uc7a5\uc560(MDD)\ub294 \uc804 \uc138\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ubc31\ub9cc \uba85\uc5d0\uac8c \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\uba70, \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ubcd1\ub9ac\uc0dd\ub9ac\ud559\uc744 \ub1cc \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uc5ed\ud559\uc758 \uad50\ub780\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e0\uacbd\uc601\uc0c1 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc740 \uc6b0\uc6b8\uc99d \uc9c4\ub2e8\uc5d0\uc11c \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc8fc\ub85c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18\uc774\uba70, \uc2e0\uacbd\uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801 \ud574\uc11d\ub825\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud55c \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c \uc791\ub3d9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5ec\uae30\uc11c\ub294 \uc6b0\uc6b8\uc99d \ud2b9\uc815 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uacf5\uac04\uc801 \uaddc\ubaa8\uc5d0\uc11c \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uacc4\uce35\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e0\uacbd\uacfc\ud559 \ubd84\uc57c \uc9c0\uc2dd\uacfc \ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd\uc744 \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ud601\uc2e0\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 NH-GCAT(\uc2e0\uacbd\ud68c\ub85c \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc740 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc778\uacfc \uc8fc\uc758 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c)\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \uae30\uc220 \uae30\uc5ec\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: (1) \uad6d\uc18c \ub1cc \uc9c0\uc5ed \uc218\uc900\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \ud608\uc561 \uc0b0\uc18c\ud654 \uc218\uc900 \uc758\uc874(BOLD) \uc5ed\ud559\uacfc \uae30\ub2a5\uc801 \uc5f0\uacb0 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uc794\uc5ec \uac8c\uc774\ud2b8 \uc735\ud569 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc6b0\uc6b8\uc99d \uad00\ub828 \uc800\uc8fc\ud30c \uc2e0\uacbd \uc9c4\ub3d9\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud2b9\ubcc4\ud788 \uc124\uacc4\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4; (2) \ub2e4\uc9c0\uc5ed \ud68c\ub85c \uc218\uc900\uc5d0\uc11c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud655\ub9bd\ub41c \uc6b0\uc6b8\uc99d \uc2e0\uacbd \ud68c\ub85c \uc870\uc9c1\uc744 \ub530\ub974\ub294 \uc9c0\uc5ed \ub178\ub4dc \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uc9d1\uacc4\ud558\ub294 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ud68c\ub85c \uc778\ucf54\ub529 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4; (3) \ub2e4\ud68c\ub85c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uc218\uc900\uc5d0\uc11c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ud68c\ub85c \uac04\uc758 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc131 \uc815\ubcf4 \ud750\ub984\uc744 \ucd94\ub860\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc5f0\uc18d \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uc7a0\uc7ac \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ubcc0\uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc7a0\uc7ac \uc778\uacfc \uc8fc\uc758 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

We extend the Jeffrey-Bolker framework to model refinements in values and prove a value-of-information theorem for axiological refinement. In multi-agent settings, we establish that mutual refinement will characteristically transform zero-sum games into positive-sum interactions and yields Pareto-improving Nash bargains. These results show that a framework of rational choice can be extended to model value refinement and its associated benefits. By unifying epistemic and axiological refinement under a single formalism, we broaden the conceptual foundations of rational choice and illuminate the normative status of ethical deliberation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc81c\ud504\ub9ac-\ubcfc\ucee4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uc5ec \uac00\uce58\uc758 \uc815\uc81c\ub97c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \ud558\uace0, \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c1\ud638 \uc815\uc81c\uac00 \uc81c\ub85c\uc12c \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \uae0d\uc815\uc801 \ud569 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc0ac\uc2e4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8e8\uc9c0\ub9cc \uace0\uc815\ub41c \uac12\uc744 \uac00\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc81c\ud504\ub9ac-\ubcfc\ucee4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uc5ec \uac00\uce58\uc758 \uc815\uc81c\ub97c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uace0, \uac00\uce58 \uc815\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4\uc758 \uac00\uce58 \uc815\ub9ac\ub97c \uc99d\uba85\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc0c1\ud638 \uc815\uc81c\uac00 \uc81c\ub85c\uc12c \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \uae0d\uc815\uc801 \ud569\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\uace0, \ud30c\ub808\ud1a0 \uac1c\uc120\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub0b4\uc26c \ud611\uc0c1\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ud569\ub9ac\uc801 \uc120\ud0dd\uc758 \ud2c0\uc744 \uac00\uce58 \uc815\uc81c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uace0, epistemic\uacfc axiological \uc815\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e8\uc77c \ud615\uc2dd\uccb4\ub85c \ud1b5\ud569\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ud569\ub9ac\uc801 \uc120\ud0dd\uc758 \uac1c\ub150\uc801 \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \ub113\ud78c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud45c\uc900 \uacb0\uc815 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc0ac\uc2e4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8e8\uc9c0\ub9cc \uace0\uc815\ub41c \uac12\uc744 \uac00\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc81c\ud504\ub9ac-\ubcfc\ucee4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uc5ec \uac00\uce58\uc758 \uc815\uc81c\ub97c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uace0 \uac00\uce58 \uc815\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4\uc758 \uac00\uce58 \uc815\ub9ac\ub97c \uc99d\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c1\ud638 \uc815\uc81c\uac00 \uc81c\ub85c\uc12c \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \uae0d\uc815\uc801 \ud569 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\uace0 \ud30c\ub808\ud1a0-\uac1c\uc120 \ub0b4\uc26c \ud611\uc0c1\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ud655\ub9bd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ud569\ub9ac\uc801 \uc120\ud0dd\uc758 \ud2c0\uc744 \uac00\uce58 \uc815\uc81c\uc640 \uad00\ub828\ub41c \uc774\uc810 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud3c9\uc815\ud559\uacfc \uac00\uce58 \uc815\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e8\uc77c \ud615\uc2dd\uccb4\ub85c \ud1b5\ud569\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ud569\ub9ac\uc801 \uc120\ud0dd\uc758 \uac1c\ub150\uc801 \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \ub113\ud788\uace0 \uc724\ub9ac\uc801 \uc219\uace0\uc758 \uaddc\ubc94\uc801 \uc9c0\uc704\ub97c \uc870\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Greedy assignment policies that match each agent to its highest-preference or lowest-cost task can maximize efficiency but often create inequities: some tasks receive disproportionately favorable service (e.g., shorter delays or better matches), while others face long waits or poor allocations.\n  We study fairness in heterogeneous multi-agent systems where tasks vary in preference alignment and urgency. Most existing approaches either assume centralized coordination or largely ignore fairness under partial observability. Distinct from this prior work, we establish a connection between the Eisenberg-Gale (EG) equilibrium convex program and decentralized, partially observable multi-agent learning. Building on this connection, we develop two equilibrium-informed algorithms that integrate fairness and efficiency: (i) a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework, EG-MARL, whose training is guided by centralized fair assignment algorithms (EG and a preference-aware Hungarian method); and (ii) a stochastic online optimization mechanism that performs guided exploration and subset-based fair assignment as tasks are discovered.\n  We evaluate our frameworks across a range of team sizes and assignment formulations against centralized EG, Hungarian, and Min-Max Distance baselines. Both algorithms preserve the fairness-efficiency balance of the Eisenberg-Gale equilibrium under partial observability. EG-MARL achieves near-centralized coordination and reduced travel distances, while the stochastic online mechanism enables real-time allocation with competitive fairness. Together, these results demonstrate that spatially aware EG formulations can effectively guide decentralized coordination in agents with heterogeneous capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ud568\uaed8 \uace0\ub824\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uacf5\uac04 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud560\ub2f9 \uc5f0\uad6c.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uc911 \ub85c\ubd07 \ubc30\ub2ec \ubc0f \ucc28\ub7c9 \uacf5\uc720\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\uc5c5 \uac04 \uacf5\uc815\ud55c \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc640 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc774 \ud544\uc694.", "method": "Eisenberg-Gale \uade0\ud615 \ubcfc\ub85d \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uacfc \ube44\uc911\uc559\uc9d1\uc911\uc801, \ubd80\ubd84 \uad00\ucc30 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud559\uc2b5 \uac04\uc758 \uc5f0\uacb0\uc744 \ud655\ub9bd\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uacfc \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c EG-MARL \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uacfc \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "EG-MARL\uc740 \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uc911\uc2dd \uc870\uc815\uc5d0 \uac00\uae4c\uc6b4 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ub0b4\uace0 \uac10\uc18c\ub41c \uc774\ub3d9 \uac70\ub9ac\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc740 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \ud560\ub2f9\uc5d0\uc11c \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc774\uc885 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc548\ub0b4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub2e4\uc911 \ub85c\ubd07 \ubc30\ub2ec\uc774\ub098 \ucc28\ub7c9 \uacf5\uc720\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uacf5\uac04 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud560\ub2f9\uc740 \uc791\uc5c5 \uac04\uc758 \uacf5\uc815\ud55c \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc640 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uade0\ud615 \uc788\uac8c \ub9de\ucd94\uc5b4\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac01 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uac00\uc7a5 \uc120\ud638\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \uac00\uc7a5 \ub0ae\uc740 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub9e4\uce6d\ud558\ub294 \ud0d0\uc695\uc801 \ud560\ub2f9 \uc815\ucc45\uc740 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc885\uc885 \ubd88\uacf5\uc815\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud558\uc5ec \uc77c\ubd80 \uc791\uc5c5\uc740 \ubd88\uade0\ud615\uc801\uc778 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\ub97c \ubc1b\uac70\ub098 \uae34 \ub300\uae30 \uc2dc\uac04\uacfc \ubd88\ub7c9 \ud560\ub2f9\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud558\uac8c \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc120\ud638 \uc77c\uce58\uc640 \uae34\uae09\uc131\uc774 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uc774\uc885 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uc911\uc2dd \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uac00\uc815\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ubd80\ubd84 \uad00\ucc30 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ubb34\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 Eisenberg-Gale (EG) \uade0\ud615 \ubcfc\ub85d \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uacfc \ube44\uc911\uc559\uc9d1\uc911\uc801, \ubd80\ubd84 \uad00\ucc30 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud559\uc2b5 \uac04\uc758 \uc5f0\uacb0\uc744 \ud655\ub9bd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uacb0\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uacfc \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uade0\ud615 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: (i) \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uc911\uc2dd \uacf5\uc815 \ud560\ub2f9 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 (EG \ubc0f \uc120\ud638 \uc778\uc9c0 \ud5dd\uac00\ub9ac \ubc29\ubc95)\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ud6c8\ub828\uc774 \uc548\ub0b4\ub418\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 (MARL) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 EG-MARL;

However, strict isolation and maintaining runtime security in these environments has become increasingly challenging. Existing approaches like seccomp and Mandatory Access Control (MAC) frameworks offer some protection up to a limit, but often lack context awareness, syscall argument filtering, and adaptive enforcement, providing the ability to adjust decisions at runtime based on observed application behavior, workload changes, or detected anomalies rather than relying solely on static or predefined rules.This paper introduces eBPF-PATROL (eBPF-Protective Agent for Threat Recognition and Overreach Limitation), an extensible lightweight runtime security agent that uses extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) technology to monitor and enforce policies in containerized and virtualized environments. By intercepting system calls, analyzing execution context, and applying user-defined rules, eBPF-PATROL detects and prevents real-time boundary violations, such as reverse shells, privilege escalation, and container escape attempts. We describe the architecture, implementation, and evaluation of eBPF-PATROL, demonstrating its low overhead (< 2.5 percent) and high detection accuracy across real-world attack scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "eBPF-PATROL\uc740 \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108\ud654 \ubc0f \uac00\uc0c1\ud654 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf4\uc548 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\ud558\uace0 \uc2dc\ud589\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uacbd\ub7c9 \ub7f0\ud0c0\uc784 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc \ubc0f \ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc \ub124\uc774\ud2f0\ube0c \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305\uc758 \uc99d\uac00\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \uaca9\ub9ac\uc640 \ub7f0\ud0c0\uc784 \ubcf4\uc548\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6cc\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \ud55c\uacc4\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "eBPF-PATROL\uc740 \ud655\uc7a5\ub41c Berkeley \ud328\ud0b7 \ud544\ud130 \uae30\uc220\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ud638\ucd9c\uc744 \uac00\ub85c\ucc44\uace0 \uc2e4\ud589 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uba70 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uac00 \uc815\uc758\ud55c \uaddc\uce59\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\uc81c \uacf5\uaca9 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c 2.5% \ubbf8\ub9cc\uc758 \ub0ae\uc740 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\uc640 \ub192\uc740 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "eBPF-PATROL\uc740 \ub7f0\ud0c0\uc784 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc704\ubc18\uc744 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \uac10\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \ubc29\uc9c0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc \ubc0f \ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc \ub124\uc774\ud2f0\ube0c \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305\uc758 \uc0ac\uc6a9 \ubc0f \ucc44\ud0dd\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uae30\ubcf8 \uae30\uc220(\uc989, \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108\ud654 \ubc0f \uac00\uc0c1\ud654)\uc774 \uae30\ucd08\uac00 \ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \uaca9\ub9ac \ubc0f \ub7f0\ud0c0\uc784 \ubcf4\uc548\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6cc\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. seccomp \ubc0f \uc758\ubb34\uc801 \uc811\uadfc \uc81c\uc5b4(MAC) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ud55c\uacc4\uae4c\uc9c0\ub294 \ubcf4\ud638\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc885\uc885 \ub9e5\ub77d \uc778\uc2dd, \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ud638\ucd9c \uc778\uc218 \ud544\ud130\ub9c1 \ubc0f \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc9d1\ud589\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4. \uc989, \uad00\ucc30\ub41c \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158 \ub3d9\uc791, \uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c\ub4dc \ubcc0\ud654 \ub610\ub294 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub41c \uc774\uc0c1 \uc9d5\ud6c4\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ub7f0\ud0c0\uc784\uc5d0\uc11c \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud788 \uc815\uc801 \ub610\ub294 \uc0ac\uc804 \uc815\uc758\ub41c \uaddc\uce59\uc5d0\ub9cc \uc758\uc874\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubc31\uc11c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uacbd\ub7c9\uc758 \ub7f0\ud0c0\uc784 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc778 eBPF-PATROL(eBPF-Threat Recognition \ubc0f Overreach Limitation\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ubcf4\ud638 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8)\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108\ud654 \ubc0f \uac00\uc0c1\ud654 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\ud558\uace0 \uc9d1\ud589\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud655\uc7a5\ub41c Berkeley \ud328\ud0b7 \ud544\ud130(eBPF) \uae30\uc220\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ud638\ucd9c\uc744 \uac00\ub85c\ucc44\uace0, \uc2e4\ud589 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uba70, \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc815\uc758 \uaddc\uce59\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 eBPF-PATROL\uc740 \ub9ac\ubc84\uc2a4 \uc178, \uad8c\ud55c \uc0c1\uc2b9 \ubc0f \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108 \ud0c8\ucd9c \uc2dc\ub3c4\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \uacbd\uacc4 \uc704\ubc18\uc744 \uac10\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \ubc29\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 eBPF-PATROL\uc758 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98, \uad6c\ud604 \ubc0f \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc124\uba85\ud558\uba70, \uc2e4\uc81c \uacf5\uaca9 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624 \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \ub0ae\uc740 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc(< 2.5%)\uc640 \ub192\uc740 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

The cascaded architecture has emerged as the mainstream paradigm for deep learning-based precipitation nowcasting. This paradigm involves a deterministic model to predict macroscopic trends (or posterior mean), followed by a probabilistic model to generate local details (or local stochasticity). However, existing methods commonly overlook the conflation of the systematic distribution shift in deterministic predictions and the local stochasticity. As a result, the deterministic component's distribution shift contaminates the predictions of the probabilistic component, leading to inaccuracies in precipitation patterns and intensity, particularly over longer lead times. To address this issue, we introduce RectiCast, a two-stage framework that explicitly decouples the correction of mean-field shift from the generation of local stochasticity via a dual Flow Matching model. In the first stage, a deterministic model generates the posterior mean. In the second stage, we introduce a Rectifier to explicitly learn the distribution shift and produce a rectified mean. Subsequently, a Generator focuses on modeling the local stochasticity conditioned on the rectified mean. Experiments on SEVIR and MeteoNet demonstrate that RectiCast achieves significant performance improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "RectiCast\ub294 \uac15\uc6b0 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ud3c9\uade0\uc7a5 \uc774\ub3d9 \ubcf4\uc815\uacfc \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc801 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc744 \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 2\ub2e8\uacc4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc815\ud655\ud55c \uac15\uc6b0 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ub808\uc774\ub354 \uad00\uce21\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uace0\ud574\uc0c1\ub3c4 \uac15\uc6b0 \uc608\uce21\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "RectiCast\ub294 2\ub2e8\uacc4 \uad6c\uc870\ub85c, \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uacb0\uc815\ub860\uc801 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud6c4\ubc29 \ud3c9\uade0\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0, \ub450 \ubc88\uc9f8 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c Rectifier\uac00 \ubd84\ud3ec \uc774\ub3d9\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uc5ec \uc218\uc815\ub41c \ud3c9\uade0\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uadf8 \ud6c4 Generator\uac00 \uc218\uc815\ub41c \ud3c9\uade0\uc744 \uc870\uac74\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc801 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "SEVIR\uc640 MeteoNet\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, RectiCast\ub294 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "RectiCast\ub294 \uacb0\uc815\ub860\uc801 \uc608\uce21\uc758 \ubd84\ud3ec \uc774\ub3d9\uacfc \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc801 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc744 \uba85\ud655\ud788 \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\uc5ec \uac15\uc6b0 \uc608\uce21\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac15\uc6b0 \uc608\uce21\uc740 \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ub808\uc774\ub354 \uad00\uce21\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub192\uc740 \uacf5\uac04-\uc2dc\uac04 \ud574\uc0c1\ub3c4\uc758 \uac15\uc6b0 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud558\uba70, \uc9c0\uc5ed \uae30\uc0c1 \uc608\uce21\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec \uc791\uc5c5\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud604\uc7ac \uc2ec\uce35 \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc18 \uac15\uc6b0 \uc608\uce21\uc758 \uc8fc\ub958 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc73c\ub85c \ub204\uc801 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uac00 \ub4f1\uc7a5\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc740 \uac70\uc2dc\uc801\uc778 \uacbd\ud5a5(\ub610\ub294 \ud6c4\ubc29 \ud3c9\uade0)\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uacb0\uc815\ub860\uc801 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774\uba70, \ub2e4\uc74c \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc801\uc778 \uc138\ubd80\uc815\ubcf4(\ub610\ub294 \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc801 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131)\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uacb0\uc815\ub860\uc801 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc801\uc778 \ubd84\ud3ec \uc774\ub3d9\uacfc \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc801 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc758 \ud63c\ud569\uc744 \uac04\uacfc\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uacb0\uc815\ub860\uc801 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\uc758 \ubd84\ud3ec \uc774\ub3d9\uc774 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\uc758 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc624\uc5fc\uc2dc\ucf1c, \ud2b9\ud788 \uae34 \ub9ac\ub4dc \ud0c0\uc784\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\uc6b0 \ud328\ud134\uacfc \uac15\ub3c4\uc758 \ubd80\uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud3c9\uade0\uc7a5 \uc774\ub3d9\uc758 \ubcf4\uc815\uc744 \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc801 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131 \uc0dd\uc131\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uba85\ud655\ud788 \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \uc774\uc911 \ud750\ub984 \uc77c\uce58 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 RectiCast\ub77c\ub294 2\ub2e8\uacc4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uacb0\uc815\ub860\uc801 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud6c4\ubc29 \ud3c9\uade0\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub450 \ubc88\uc9f8 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 Rectifier\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \ubd84\ud3ec \uc774\ub3d9\uc744 \uba85\ud655\ud788 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uace0 \uc218\uc815\ub41c \ud3c9\uade0\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8 \ud6c4 Generator\ub294 \uc218\uc815\ub41c \ud3c9\uade0\uc744 \uc870\uac74\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc801 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc9d1\uc911\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

The benchmark targets realistic, multi-hop and multi-threaded workflows that require visual grounding and textual reasoning, cross-tool dependencies, and persistence of intermediate resources across steps. We introduce a similarity-driven alignment that serializes each tool call, embeds signatures with a sentence encoder, and performs similarity-bucketed Hungarian matching to obtain auditable one-to-one correspondences. On top of this alignment, we report interpretable metrics that decouple semantic fidelity from workflow consistency. The benchmark spans 28 servers with 231 tools, and provides standardized trajectories curated through an Executor & Judge pipeline with human verification; an auxiliary four large language models (LLMs) judge ensemble reports end-task Task Completion and information grounding. Evaluations of representative state-of-the-art Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) reveal persistent gaps in multimodal MCP tool use, particularly in argument fidelity and structure consistency, underscoring the need for methods that jointly reason over images, text, and tool graphs.

Traditional MAS architectures emphasize distributed coordination and specialized autonomy, while recent advances in agentic AI driven by LLMs introduce higher order reasoning, planning, and tool orchestration capabilities. This paper presents a hybrid agentic AI and multi agent framework for a Prescriptive Maintenance use case, where LLM based agents provide strategic orchestration and adaptive reasoning, complemented by rule based and SLMs agents performing efficient, domain specific tasks on the edge. The proposed framework adopts a layered architecture that consists of perception, preprocessing, analytics, and optimization layers, coordinated through an LLM Planner Agent that manages workflow decisions and context retention. Specialized agents autonomously handle schema discovery, intelligent feature analysis, model selection, and prescriptive optimization, while a HITL interface ensures transparency and auditability of generated maintenance recommendations. This hybrid design supports dynamic model adaptation, cost efficient maintenance scheduling, and interpretable decision making. An initial proof of concept implementation is validated on two industrial manufacturing datasets. The developed framework is modular and extensible, supporting seamless integration of new agents or domain modules as capabilities evolve. The results demonstrate the system capability to automatically detect schema, adapt preprocessing pipelines, optimize model performance through adaptive intelligence, and generate actionable, prioritized maintenance recommendations. The framework shows promise in achieving improved robustness, scalability, and explainability for RxM in smart manufacturing, bridging the gap between high level agentic reasoning and low level autonomous execution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uc81c\uc870 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(SMS)\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc9c0\ub2a5\ud615 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc744

However, when applied to large-scale firmware, their performance degrades due to the binary nature of firmware, complex dependency structures, and heterogeneous components. To address this challenge, this paper presents FIRMHIVE, a recursive agent hive that enables LLMs to act as autonomous firmware security analysts. FIRMHIVE introduces two key mechanisms: (1) transforming delegation into a per-agent, executable primitive and (2) constructing a runtime Tree of Agents (ToA) for decentralized coordination. We evaluate FIRMHIVE using real-world firmware images obtained from publicly available datasets, covering five representative security analysis tasks. Compared with existing LLM-agent baselines, FIRMHIVE performs deeper (about 16x more reasoning steps) and broader (about 2.3x more files inspected) cross-file exploration, resulting in about 5.6x more alerts per firmware. Compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) security tools, FIRMHIVE identifies about 1.5x more vulnerabilities (1,802 total) and achieves 71% precision, representing significant improvements in both yield and fidelity.", "AI": {"tldr": "FIRMHIVE\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \ud38c\uc6e8\uc5b4\uc758 \ucf54\ub4dc \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \ucde8\uc57d\uc131 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub97c \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud558\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc790\uc728 \ud38c\uc6e8\uc5b4 \ubcf4\uc548 \ubd84\uc11d \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \ud38c\uc6e8\uc5b4\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud560 \ub54c LLM\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc800\ud558 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "FIRMHIVE\ub294 \ub300\ub9ac \uc704\uc784\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ub2e8\uc704\uc758 \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5 \uc6d0\uc2dc\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\uace0, \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub7f0\ud0c0\uc784 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud2b8\ub9ac\ub97c \uad6c\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud575\uc2ec \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "FIRMHIVE\ub294 \uae30\uc874 LLM-\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc57d 16\ubc30 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc740 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud558\uace0, \uc57d 2.3\ubc30 \ub9ce\uc740 \ud30c\uc77c\uc744 \uac80\uc0ac\ud558\uc5ec \ud38c\uc6e8\uc5b4 \ub2f9 \uc57d 5.6\ubc30 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc740 \uacbd\uace0\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "FIRMHIVE\ub294 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ubcf4\uc548 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc57d 1.5\ubc30 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc740 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0 71%\uc758 \uc815\ubc00\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uc218\ud655\ub7c9\uacfc \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uacfc \uadf8 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ucf54\ub4dc \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \ucde8\uc57d\uc131 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub97c \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ud38c\uc6e8\uc5b4\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud560 \ub54c \ud38c\uc6e8\uc5b4\uc758 \uc774\uc9c4\uc131, \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc885\uc18d \uad6c\uc870 \ubc0f \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc800\ud558\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 LLM\uc774 \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud38c\uc6e8\uc5b4 \ubcf4\uc548 \ubd84\uc11d\uac00\ub85c \uc791\ub3d9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uc7ac\uadc0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud558\uc774\ube0c\uc778 FIRMHIVE\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

This especially holds for approaches that adapt to users and their specific states (e.g., motivation, knowledge, wants) over time. However, developing such approaches requires making many design choices, whose effectiveness is difficult to predict from literature and costly to evaluate in practice. In this work, we explore whether large language models (LLMs) can be used out-of-the-box to generate samples of user interactions that provide useful information for training reinforcement learning models for digital behavior change settings. Using real user data from four large behavior change studies as comparison, we show that LLM-generated samples can be useful in the absence of real data. Comparisons to the samples provided by human raters further show that LLM-generated samples reach the performance of human raters. Additional analyses of different prompting strategies including shorter and longer prompt variants, chain-of-thought prompting, and few-shot prompting show that the relative effectiveness of different strategies depends on both the study and the LLM with also relatively large differences between prompt paraphrases alone. We provide recommendations for how LLM-generated samples can be useful in practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc804\uc790 \uac74\uac15 \ud589\ub3d9 \ubcc0\ud654 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc744

As engineered systems grow in complexity, conventional FMEA methods, largely manual, document-centric, and expert-dependent, have become increasingly inadequate for addressing the demands of modern systems engineering. We examine how techniques from Artificial Intelligence (AI), including machine learning and natural language processing, can transform FMEA into a more dynamic, data-driven, intelligent, and model-integrated process by automating failure prediction, prioritisation, and knowledge extraction from operational data. In parallel, we explore the role of ontologies in formalising system knowledge, supporting semantic reasoning, improving traceability, and enabling cross-domain interoperability. The review also synthesises emerging hybrid approaches, such as ontology-informed learning and large language model integration, which further enhance explainability and automation. These developments are discussed within the broader context of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) and function modelling, showing how AI and ontologies can support more adaptive and resilient FMEA workflows. We critically analyse a range of tools, case studies, and integration strategies, while identifying key challenges related to data quality, explainability, standardisation, and interdisciplinary adoption. By leveraging AI, systems engineering, and knowledge representation using ontologies, this review offers a structured roadmap for embedding FMEA within intelligent, knowledge-rich engineering

Communication (i.e., ``\\textit{Tell}'') can assist in the cognitive development process by information dissemination, yet it is inevitably subject to real-world constraints such as noise, latency, and attacks. Therefore, building the understanding of teammates' decisions without communication remains challenging. To address this, we propose a novel non-communication MARL framework that realizes the construction of cognition through local observation-based modeling (i.e., \\textit{``Think''}). Our framework enables agents to model teammates' \\textbf{active inference} process. At first, the proposed method produces three teammate portraits: perception-belief-action. Specifically, we model the teammate's decision process as follows: 1) Perception: observing environments; 2) Belief: forming beliefs; 3) Action: making decisions.

While these systems democratize software creation through natural language requirements, they introduce significant security risks that remain largely unexplored. We identify two risky scenarios: Malicious User with Benign Agents (MU-BA) and Benign User with Malicious Agents (BU-MA). We introduce the Implicit Malicious Behavior Injection Attack (IMBIA), demonstrating how multi-agent systems can be manipulated to generate software with concealed malicious capabilities beneath seemingly benign applications, and propose Adv-IMBIA as a defense mechanism. Evaluations across ChatDev, MetaGPT, and AgentVerse frameworks reveal varying vulnerability patterns, with IMBIA achieving attack success rates of 93%, 45%, and 71% in MU-BA scenarios, and 71%, 84%, and 45% in BU-MA scenarios. Our defense mechanism reduced attack success rates significantly, particularly in the MU-BA scenario. Further analysis reveals that compromised agents in the coding and testing phases pose significantly greater security risks, while also identifying critical agents that require protection against malicious user exploitation. Our findings highlight the urgent need for robust security measures in multi-agent software development systems and provide practical guidelines for implementing targeted, resource-efficient defensive strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \ud601\uc2e0\ud558\uc600\uc73c\ub098 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc704\ud5d8\uc774 \uc874\uc7ac\ud55c\ub2e4.

Our system is based on a micro-service edge-compute platform that ingests real-time sensor data from the process into a digital twin over a converged network infrastructure. We implement agile machine learning-based control loops in the digital twin to optimize induction furnace heating, enhance operational quality, and reduce process waste. Key to our approach is a Deep Reinforcement learning-based agent used in our machine learning operation (MLOps) driven system to autonomously correlate the system state with its digital twin to identify correction actions that aim to optimize power settings for the plant. We present the theoretical basis, architectural details, and practical implications of our approach to reduce manufacturing waste and increase production quality. We design the system for flexibility so that our scalable event-driven architecture can be adapted to various industrial applications. With this research, we propose a pivotal step towards the transformation of traditional processes into intelligent systems, aligning with sustainability goals and emphasizing the role of MLOps in shaping the future of data-driven manufacturing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \ud2b8\uc708 \uae30\ubc18 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uc81c\uc870\uc5d0\uc11c

We introduce QuickLAP: Quick Language-Action Preference learning, a Bayesian framework that fuses physical and language feedback to infer reward functions in real time. Our key insight is to treat language as a probabilistic observation over the user's latent preferences, clarifying which reward features matter and how physical corrections should be interpreted. QuickLAP uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract reward feature attention masks and preference shifts from free-form utterances, which it integrates with physical feedback in a closed-form update rule. This enables fast, real-time, and robust reward learning that handles ambiguous feedback. In a semi-autonomous driving simulator, QuickLAP reduces reward learning error by over 70% compared to physical-only and heuristic multimodal baselines. A 15-participant user study further validates our approach: participants found QuickLAP significantly more understandable and collaborative, and preferred its learned behavior over baselines.

Through a series of educator interviews, we first identify and systematically categorize the key friction points that impede this adaptation process. Grounded in these findings, we introduce a novel multi-agent framework designed to automate slide adaptation based on high-level instructor specifications. An evaluation involving 16 modification requests across 8 real-world courses validates our approach. The framework's output consistently achieved high scores in intent alignment, content coherence and factual accuracy, and performed on par with baseline methods regarding visual clarity, while also demonstrating appropriate timeliness and a high operational agreement with human experts, achieving an F1 score of 0.89. This work heralds a new paradigm where AI agents handle the logistical burdens of instructional design, liberating educators to focus on the creative and strategic aspects of teaching.", "AI":

We present LockForge, a first-of-its-kind, multi-agent large language model (LLM) framework that turns LL descriptions in papers into executable and tested code. LockForge provides a carefully crafted pipeline realizing forethought, implementation, iterative refinement, and a multi-stage validation, all to systematically bridge the gap between prose and practice for complex LL schemes. For validation, we devise (i) an LLM-as-Judge stage with a scoring system considering behavioral checks, conceptual mechanisms, structural elements, and reproducibility on benchmarks, and (ii) an independent LLM-as-Examiner stage for ground-truth assessment. We apply LockForge to 10 seminal LL schemes, many of which lack reference implementations. Our evaluation on multiple SOTA LLMs, including ablation studies, reveals the significant complexity of the task. We show that an advanced reasoning model and a sophisticated, multi-stage framework like LockForge are required.

However, integrating these sources into coherent spatial models for planning and prediction remains a major challenge. Existing agent-centric methods often rely on direct environmental sensing, limiting scalability and raising privacy concerns. This paper introduces CubeletWorld, a novel framework for representing and analyzing urban environments through a discretized 3D grid of spatial units called cubelets. This abstraction enables privacy-preserving modeling by embedding diverse data signals, such as infrastructure, movement, or environmental indicators, into localized cubelet states. CubeletWorld supports downstream tasks such as planning, navigation, and occupancy prediction without requiring agent-driven sensing. To evaluate this paradigm, we propose the CubeletWorld State Prediction task, which involves predicting the cubelet state using a realistic dataset containing various urban elements like streets and buildings through this discretized representation. We explore a range of modified core models suitable for our setting and analyze challenges posed by increasing spatial granularity, specifically the issue of sparsity in representation and scalability of baselines. In contrast to existing 3D occupancy prediction models, our cubelet-centric approach focuses on inferring state at the spatial unit level, enabling greater generalizability across regions and improved privacy compliance. Our results demonstrate that CubeletWorld offers a flexible and extensible framework for learning from complex urban data, and it opens up new possibilities for scalable simulation and decision support in domains such as socio-demographic modeling, environmental monitoring, and emergency response.

As a result, the actual ability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to process and integrate chemically meaningful information across modalities remains unclear. We introduce \\textbf{ChemVTS-Bench}, a domain-authentic benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the Visual-Textual-Symbolic (VTS) reasoning abilities of MLLMs. ChemVTS-Bench contains diverse and challenging chemical problems spanning organic molecules, inorganic materials, and 3D crystal structures, with each task presented in three complementary input modes: (1) visual-only, (2) visual-text hybrid, and (3) SMILES-based symbolic input. This design enables fine-grained analysis of modality-dependent reasoning behaviors and cross-modal integration. To ensure rigorous and reproducible evaluation, we further develop an automated agent-based workflow that standardizes inference, verifies answers, and diagnoses failure modes. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal that visual-only inputs remain challenging, structural chemistry is the hardest domain, and multimodal fusion mitigates but does not eliminate visual, knowledge-based, or logical errors, highlighting ChemVTS-Bench as a rigorous, domain-faithful testbed for advancing multimodal chemical reasoning.

However, the inherent communication latency in practical systems induces both action decision delays and outdated information sharing, impeding MARL performance gains, particularly in time-critical applications like autonomous driving. In this work, we propose a Value-of-Information aware Low-latency Communication(VIL2C) scheme that proactively adjusts the latency distribution to mitigate its effects in MARL systems. Specifically, we define a Value of Information (VOI) metric to quantify the importance of delayed message transmission based on each delayed message's importance. Moreover, we propose a progressive message reception mechanism to adaptively adjust the reception duration based on received messages. We derive the optimized VoI aware resource allocation and theoretically prove the performance advantage of the proposed VIL2C scheme. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VIL2C outperforms existing approaches under various communication conditions. These gains are attributed to the low-latency transmission of high-VoI messages via resource allocation and the elimination of unnecessary waiting periods via adaptive reception duration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud611\ub825\uc801\uc778 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc744 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(MARL) \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc740 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \ubc0f \uc815\ubcf4 \uacf5\uc720\uc758 \uad6c\uc2dd\ud654\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud558\uc5ec \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uc800\ud574\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc815\ubcf4 \uac00\uce58(VOI)\ub97c \uace0\ub824\ud55c \uc800\uc9c0\uc5f0 \ud1b5\uc2e0(VIL2C) \ubc29\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \uc9c0\uc5f0\ub41c \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c VOI \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc81c\uacf5\ub418\ub294 \uc815\ubcf4\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc218\uc2e0 \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc218\uc2e0 \uae30\uac04\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc810\uc9c4\uc801\uc778 \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0 \uc218\uc2e0 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 VIL2C\uac00 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc870\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ub2a5\uac00\ud568\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c VIL2C \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc790\uc6d0 \ud560\ub2f9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub192\uc740 VOI \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0\ub97c \uc800\uc9c0\uc5f0\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\uc1a1\ud558\uace0, \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc218\uc2e0 \uae30\uac04\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubd88\ud544\uc694\ud55c \ub300\uae30 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \uc81c\uac70\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc774\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc740 \ud611\ub825\uc801\uc778 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(MARL) \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uace0\uc720\ud55c \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc740 \ud589\ub3d9 \uacb0\uc815 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uacfc \uad6c\uc2dd \uc815\ubcf4 \uacf5\uc720\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud558\uc5ec MARL \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uc800\ud574\ud558\uba70, \ud2b9\ud788 \uc790\uc728\uc8fc\ud589\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc81c\uc57d\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0\uc11c \ub354\uc6b1 \ub450\ub4dc\ub7ec\uc9d1\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 MARL \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc815\ubcf4 \uac00\uce58 \uc778\uc2dd \uc800\uc9c0\uc5f0 \ud1b5\uc2e0(VIL2C) \ubc29\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \uac01 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc9c0\uc5f0\ub41c \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0 \uc804\uc1a1\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4 \uac00\uce58(VOI) \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc744 \uc815\uc758\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc218\uc2e0\ub41c \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc218\uc2e0 \uae30\uac04\uc744 \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc810\uc9c4\uc801\uc778 \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0 \uc218\uc2e0 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub41c VOI \uc778\uc2dd \uc790\uc6d0 \ud560\ub2f9\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uace0, \uc81c\uc548\ub41c VIL2C \ubc29\uc548\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc774\uc810\uc744 \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc99d\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 VIL2C\uac00 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc870\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ucd08\uc6d4\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc774\uc810\uc740 \uc790\uc6d0 \ud560\ub2f9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub192\uc740 VOI \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0\ub97c \uc800\uc9c0\uc5f0\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\uc1a1\ud558\uace0, \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc218\uc2e0 \uae30\uac04\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubd88\ud544\uc694\ud55c \ub300\uae30 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \uc81c\uac70\ud55c \ub370 \uae30\uc778\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Configuring CKKS involves a tightly coupled space of ring dimensions, modulus chains, and packing layouts. Without deep cryptographic knowledge to navigate these interactions, practitioners are restricted to compilers that rely on fixed heuristics. These \"one-shot\" tools often emit rigid configurations that are either severely over-provisioned in latency or fail to find a feasible solution entirely for deeper networks.\n  We present FHE-Agent, an agentic framework that automates this expert reasoning process. By coupling a Large Language Model (LLM) controller with a deterministic tool suite, FHE-Agent decomposes the search into global parameter selection and layer-wise bottleneck repair. The agents operate within a multi-fidelity workflow, pruning invalid regimes using cheap static analysis and reserving expensive encrypted evaluations for the most promising candidates.\n  We instantiate FHE-Agent on the Orion compiler and evaluate it on standard benchmarks (MLP, LeNet, LoLa) and deeper architectures (AlexNet). FHE-Agent consistently achieves better precision and lower latency than na\u00efve search strategies.

Recently developed Contrastive Local Learning Networks (CLLNs) - analog networks of self-adjusting nonlinear resistors - are inherently low-power and robust to physical damage, but were constructed to perform supervised learning. In this work we demonstrate success on two simple RL problems using Q-learning adapted for simulated CLLNs. Doing so makes explicit the components (beyond the network being trained) required to enact various tools in the RL toolbox, some of which (policy function and value function) are more natural in this system than others (replay buffer). We discuss assumptions such as the physical safety that digital hardware requires, CLLNs can forgo, and biological systems cannot rely on, and highlight secondary goals that are important in biology and trainable in CLLNs, but make little sense in digital computers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 CLLN\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc81c\ud55c \uc790\uc728 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud568.", "motivation": "\ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud130\ub294 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc18c\ube44\uac00 \ud06c\uace0 \uc190\uc0c1\ub41c \ubd80\ud488\uc5d0 \ubbfc\uac10\ud558\uc5ec, \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc81c\ud55c \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \ub3c4\uad6c\uac00 \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "Q-learning\uc744 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ub41c CLLN\uc5d0 \ub9de\uac8c \uc870\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc778 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ud6c8\ub828 \uc678\uc5d0 RL \ub3c4\uad6c\ubc15\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uad6c\ud604\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \uba85\ud655\ud788 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "CLLN\uc740 \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4\uac00 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc548\uc804\uc744 \ubb34\uc2dc\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ubcf4\uc870 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub4e4\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud130\ub294 \uc804\ub825 \uc18c\ube44\uac00 \ub9ce\uace0 \uc190\uc0c1\ub41c \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc0c1\ub300\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd88\ub0b4\uc131\uc774 \uc788\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0, \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0\uc5d0 \uc81c\ud55c\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0\uac8c\ub294 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \ub3c4\uad6c\uac00 \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc \uac1c\ubc1c\ub41c \ub300\ube44\uc801 \uc9c0\uc5ed \ud559\uc2b5 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c(CLLN)\ub294 \uc790\uae30 \uc870\uc815 \ube44\uc120\ud615 \uc800\ud56d\uae30\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \uc544\ub0a0\ub85c\uadf8 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c \ubcf8\ub798 \uc800\uc804\ub825\uc774\uba70 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc190\uc0c1\uc5d0 \uac15\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uac10\ub3c5 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uad6c\ucd95\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 Q-\ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ub41c CLLN\uc5d0 \ub9de\uac8c \uc870\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\uacf5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc911\uc778 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uc678\uc5d0 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc0c1\uc790\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uc2dc\ud589\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \uba85\ud655\ud788 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \uadf8 \uc911 \uc77c\ubd80(\uc815\ucc45 \ud568\uc218 \ubc0f \uac00\uce58 \ud568\uc218)\ub294 \uc774 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub354 \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7fd\uace0 \ub2e4\ub978 \uac83\ub4e4(\uc7ac\uc0dd \ubc84\ud37c)\uc740 \uadf8\ub807\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4\uc5d0 \uc694\uad6c\ub418\ub294 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc548\uc804\uacfc CLLN\uc774 \ud3ec\uae30\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac83, \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uc758\uc874\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \uac83\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uac00\uc815\ub4e4\uc744 \ub17c\uc758\ud558\uace0, \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud070 \uc758\ubbf8\uac00 \uc5c6\ub294 \ubcf4\uc870 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub4e4\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

We address this challenge by proposing a two-stage diagnostic framework that enhances transparency, trustworthiness, and reliability. First, we introduce Evidence-Guided Diagnostic Reasoning (EGDR), which guides LLMs to generate structured diagnostic hypotheses by interleaving evidence extraction with logical reasoning grounded in DSM-5 criteria. Second, we propose a Diagnosis Confidence Scoring (DCS) module that evaluates the factual accuracy and logical consistency of generated diagnoses through two interpretable metrics: the Knowledge Attribution Score (KAS) and the Logic Consistency Score (LCS). Evaluated on the D4 dataset with pseudo-labels, EGDR outperforms direct in-context prompting and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) across five LLMs. For instance, on OpenBioLLM, EGDR improves accuracy from 0.31 (Direct) to 0.76 and increases DCS from 0.50 to 0.67. On MedLlama, DCS rises from 0.58 (CoT) to 0.77. Overall, EGDR yields up to +45% accuracy and +36% DCS gains over baseline methods, offering a clinically grounded, interpretable foundation for trustworthy AI-assisted diagnosis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc784\uc0c1 \uc9c4\ub2e8\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uacfc \ud22c\uba85\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\ub294 \ub450 \ub2e8\uacc4 \uc9c4\ub2e8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc784\uc0c1 \uc9c4\ub2e8 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\uc5d0 \uc720\ub9dd\ud558\ub098, \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc758 \ube44\ud22c\uba85\uc131\uacfc \uc9c4\ub2e8 \uae30\uc900\uacfc\uc758 \uc815\ub82c \ubd80\uc871\uc774 \uc2e0\ub8b0 \ubc0f \uc784\uc0c1 \ucc44\ud0dd\uc744 \uc800\ud574\ud568.", "method": "Evidence-Guided Diagnostic Reasoning (EGDR)\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 LLM\uc774 DSM-5 \uae30\uc900\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uacfc \uc99d\uac70 \ucd94\ucd9c\uc744 \uad50\ucc28\ud558\uc5ec \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc9c4\ub2e8 \uac00\uc124\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc720\ub3c4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, Diagnosis Confidence Scoring (DCS) \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \uc9c4\ub2e8\uc758 \uc0ac\uc2e4\uc801 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uacfc \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc9c0\ud45c\uc778 Knowledge Attribution Score (KAS) \ubc0f Logic Consistency Score (LCS)\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "EGDR\ub294 D4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc778 \ubb38\ub9e5 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ubc0f Chain-of-Thought (CoT)\ub97c \ub2a5\uac00\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, OpenBioLLM\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c 0.31\uc5d0\uc11c 0.76\uc73c\ub85c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0 DCS\ub97c 0.50\uc5d0\uc11c 0.67\ub85c \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ucf30\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

The aim is to develop distributed protocols enabling nonfaulty/normal followers to accurately track a dynamic/time-varying reference value of the leader while they may receive misinformation from adversarial neighbors. Our methodologies employ the mean subsequence reduced algorithm with agents engaging with neighbors using multi-hop communication. We accordingly derive a necessary and sufficient graph condition for our algorithms to succeed; also, our tracking error bounds are smaller than that of the existing method.

This work presents a systematic taxonomy of existing jailbreak defenses across prompt-level, model-level, and training-time interventions, followed by three proposed defense strategies. First, a Prompt-Level Defense Framework detects and neutralizes adversarial inputs through sanitization, paraphrasing, and adaptive system guarding. Second, a Logit-Based Steering Defense reinforces refusal behavior through inference-time vector steering in safety-sensitive layers. Third, a Domain-Specific Agent Defense employs the MetaGPT framework to enforce structured, role-based collaboration and domain adherence. Experiments on benchmark datasets show substantial reductions in attack success rate, achieving full mitigation under the agent-based defense. Overall, this study highlights how jailbreaks pose a significant security threat to LLMs and identifies key intervention points for prevention, while noting that defense strategies often involve trade-offs between safety, performance, and scalability.

As such, OPE plays a critical role in ensuring safety in high-stakes domains such as healthcare. However, standard OPE approaches are limited by the size and coverage of the behavior dataset. While previous work has explored using expert-labeled counterfactual annotations to enhance dataset coverage, obtaining such annotations is expensive, limiting the scalability of prior approaches. We propose leveraging large language models (LLMs) to generate counterfactual annotations for OPE in medical domains. Our method uses domain knowledge to guide LLMs in predicting how key clinical features evolve under alternate treatments. These predicted features can then be transformed using known reward functions to create counterfactual annotations. We first evaluate the ability of several LLMs to predict clinical features across two patient subsets in MIMIC-IV, finding that state-of-the-art LLMs achieve comparable performance. Building on this capacity to predict clinical features, we generate LLM-based counterfactual annotations and incorporate them into an OPE estimator. Our empirical results analyze the benefits of counterfactual annotations under varying degrees of shift between the behavior and target policies. We find that in most cases, the LLM-based counterfactual annotations significantly improve OPE estimates up to a point. We provide an entropy-based metric to identify when additional annotations cease to be useful. Our results demonstrate that LLM-based counterfactual annotations offer a scalable approach for addressing coverage limitations in healthcare datasets, enabling safer deployment of decision-making

A primary obstacle hindering research and development in this domain has been the profound lack of a standardized benchmark to quantitatively evaluate the automated generation of diagrams from text. To address this critical gap, we introduce a novel and comprehensive benchmark, the first of its kind, designed to catalyze progress in automated scientific visualization. It consists of 3,000 research papers paired with their corresponding high-quality ground-truth diagrams and is accompanied by a three-tiered evaluation metric assessing semantic accuracy, layout coherence, and visual quality. Furthermore, to establish a strong baseline on this new benchmark, we propose Paper2SysArch, an end-to-end system that leverages multi-agent collaboration to convert papers into structured, editable diagrams. To validate its performance on complex cases, the system was evaluated on a manually curated and more challenging subset of these papers, where it achieves a composite score of 69.0. This work's principal contribution is the establishment of a large-scale, foundational benchmark to enable reproducible research and fair comparison. Meanwhile, our proposed system serves as a viable proof-of-concept, demonstrating a promising path forward for this complex task.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uacfc\ud559

However, centralized-decentralized mismatch (CDM) arises when the suboptimal behavior of one agent degrades others' learning. Prior approaches mitigate CDM through value decomposition, but linear decompositions allow per-agent gradients at the cost of limited expressiveness, while nonlinear decompositions improve representation but require centralized gradients, reintroducing CDM. To overcome this trade-off, we propose the multi-agent cross-entropy method (MCEM), combined with monotonic nonlinear critic decomposition (NCD). MCEM updates policies by increasing the probability of high-value joint actions, thereby excluding suboptimal behaviors. For sample efficiency, we extend off-policy learning with a modified k-step return and Retrace. Analysis and experiments demonstrate that MCEM outperforms state-of-the-art methods across both continuous and discrete action benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uc911-\ubd84\uc0b0 \uc2e4\ud589 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uad50\ucc28 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \ubc29\ubc95(MCEM)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud611\ub825\uc801\uc778 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ube44\ucd5c\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9\uc774 \ub2e4\ub978 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc800\ud558\uc2dc\ud0ac \ub54c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uc911-\ubd84\uc0b0 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "MCEM\uc740 \ub192\uc740 \uac00\uce58\uc758 \uacf5\ub3d9 \ud589\ub3d9\uc758 \ud655\ub960\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ucf1c \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ud558\uba70, \ubaa8\ub178\ud1a0\ub2c9 \ube44\uc120\ud615 \ube44\ud3c9\uac00 \ubd84\ud574(NCD)\uc640 \uacb0\ud569\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "MCEM\uc740 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801 \ubc0f \uc774\uc0b0\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "MCEM\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uace0 \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uba70, \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud611\ub825 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(MARL)\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc2e4\ud589\uacfc \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uc911 \ud6c8\ub828(CTDE)\uc744 \ucc44\ud0dd\ud558\uba70, \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uc911 \ube44\ud3c9\uac00\ub294 \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc561\ud130\ub97c \uc548\ub0b4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc804\uc5ed \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ube44\ucd5c\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9\uc774 \ub2e4\ub978 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc800\ud558\uc2dc\ud0ac \ub54c \uc911\uc559-\ubd84\uc0b0 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58(CDM)\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uc804 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uac00\uce58 \ubd84\ud574\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 CDM\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc120\ud615 \ubd84\ud574\ub294 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ud45c\ud604\ub825\uc744 \uac10\uc218\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ubcc4 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8\ub97c \ud5c8\uc6a9\ud558\uace0, \ube44\uc120\ud615 \ubd84\ud574\ub294 \ud45c\ud604\ub825\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uc911 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8\ub97c \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud558\uc5ec CDM\uc744 \ub2e4\uc2dc \uc720\uc785\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ub4dc\uc624\ud504\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubaa8\ub178\ud1a0\ub2c9 \ube44\uc120\ud615 \ube44\ud3c9\uac00 \ubd84\ud574(NCD)\uc640 \uacb0\ud569\ub41c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uad50\ucc28 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \ubc29\ubc95(MCEM)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Authors marked with * contributed equally. Yi Liu is the lead author", "summary": "With the rapid advancement of retrieval-augmented vision-language models, multimodal medical retrieval-augmented generation (MMed-RAG) systems are increasingly adopted in clinical decision support. These systems enhance medical applications by performing cross-modal retrieval to integrate relevant visual and textual evidence for tasks, e.g., report generation and disease diagnosis. However, their complex architecture also introduces underexplored adversarial vulnerabilities, particularly via visual input perturbations. In this paper, we propose Medusa, a novel framework for crafting cross-modal transferable adversarial attacks on MMed-RAG systems under a black-box setting. Specifically, Medusa formulates the attack as a perturbation optimization problem, leveraging a multi-positive InfoNCE loss (MPIL) to align adversarial visual embeddings with medically plausible but malicious textual targets, thereby hijacking the retrieval process. To enhance transferability, we adopt a surrogate model ensemble and design a dual-loop optimization strategy augmented with invariant risk minimization (IRM). Extensive experiments on two real-world medical tasks, including medical report generation and disease diagnosis, demonstrate that Medusa achieves over 90% average attack success rate across various generation models and retrievers under appropriate parameter configuration, while remaining robust against four mainstream defenses, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Our results reveal critical vulnerabilities in the MMed-RAG systems and highlight the necessity of robustness benchmarking in safety-critical medical applications.

By now, there is a large body of work on this topic; however, while many algorithms can achieve optimal list size in terms of $\u03b1$, all known algorithms must incur error which decays, in some cases quite poorly, with $1 / \u03b1$. In this paper, we ask if this is inherent: is it possible to trade off list size with accuracy in list-decodable learning? More formally, given $\u03b5> 0$, can we can output a slightly larger list in terms of $\u03b1$ and $\u03b5$, but so that one element of this list has error at most $\u03b5$ with the ground truth? We call this problem high-accuracy list-decodable learning. Our main result is that non-trivial high-accuracy guarantees, both information-theoretically and algorithmically, are possible for the canonical setting of list-decodable mean estimation of identity-covariance Gaussians. Specifically, we demonstrate that there exists a list of candidate means of size at most $L = \\exp \\left( O\\left( \\tfrac{\\log^2 1 / \u03b1}{\u03b5^2} \\right)\\right)$ so that one of the elements of this list has $\\ell_2$ distance at most $\u03b5$ to the true mean. We also design an algorithm that outputs such a list with runtime and sample complexity $n = d^{O(\\log L)} + \\exp \\exp (\\widetilde{O}(\\log L))$. We do so by demonstrating a completely novel proof of identifiability, as well as a new algorithmic way of leveraging this proof without the sum-of-squares hierarchy, which may be of independent technical interest.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ub514\ucf54\ub354\ube14 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ud655\uc131\uacfc \ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud06c\uae30 \uac04\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ub9de\ucd9c \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ube44\uc728 $\frac{1}{\text{\u03b1}}$\uc640 \uad00\ub828\ub41c \uc624\ub958 \uac10\uc18c\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ub514\ucf54\ub354\ube14 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ud655\uc131\uacfc \ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud06c\uae30 \uac04\uc758 \ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ub4dc\uc624\ud504 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc815\ud655\ud55c \ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud06c\uae30\ub85c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0, \uc815\uccb4 \uc0c1\uad00 \uac00\uc6b0\uc2dc\uc548\uc758 \ud3c9\uade0 \ucd94\uc815\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ucd5c\ub300 \ud06c\uae30 $L = \text{exp} \big(O\big(\frac{\text{log}^2(1/\text{\u03b1})}{\text{\u03b5}^2}\big)\big)$\uc758 \ud6c4\ubcf4 \ud3c9\uade0 \ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2b8\uac00 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\uba70, \uc774 \uc911 \ud558\ub098\uc758 \uc694\uc18c\ub294 \ucc38 \ud3c9\uade0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ucd5c\ub300 $\text{\u03b5}$\uc758 $\text{\u2113}_2$ \uac70\ub9ac\ub97c \uac00\uc9d1\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc2dd\ubcc4 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \uc99d\uba85 \ubc0f \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc774 \uc99d\uba85\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ube44\uc728\uc801 \uace0\uc815\ubc00 \ubcf4\uc99d\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ub514\ucf54\ub354\ube14 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc8fc\uc5b4\uc9c4 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8 \uc9d1\ud569\uc758 $\u03b1$\ubd84\uc758 \uc77c\ubd80\uac00 \uc88b\uc740 \ubd84\ud3ec $D$\uc5d0\uc11c \ub098\uc624\uba70, \ubaa9\ud45c\ub294 \uc774 \ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc758 \ud6c4\ubcf4 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158 \uc911 \ud558\ub098\uac00 $D$\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ube44\uacb0\uc815\uc801 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud68c\ubcf5\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9ce\uc740 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc774 $\u03b1$\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud06c\uae30\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc54c\ub824\uc9c4 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 $1 / \u03b1$\uc758 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubc1b\ub294 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \ubc1c\uc0dd\uc2dc\ucf1c\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ub514\ucf54\ub354\ube14 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud06c\uae30\uc640 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4 \uac04\uc758 \ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ub4dc\uc624\ud504 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc9c8\ubb38\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc815\uccb4 \uc0c1\uad00 \uac00\uc6b0\uc2dc\uc548\uc758 \ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ub514\ucf54\ub354\ube14 \ud3c9\uade0 \ucd94\uc815\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uace0\uc815\ubc00 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uacfc \uc815\ubcf4 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

In response to this challenge, we present BioSage, a novel compound AI architecture that integrates LLMs with RAG, orchestrated specialized agents and tools to enable discoveries across AI, data science, biomedical, and biosecurity domains. Our system features several specialized agents including the retrieval agent with query planning and response synthesis that enable knowledge retrieval across domains with citation-backed responses, cross-disciplinary translation agents that align specialized terminology and methodologies, and reasoning agents that synthesize domain-specific insights with transparency, traceability and usability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our BioSage system through a rigorous evaluation on scientific benchmarks (LitQA2, GPQA, WMDP, HLE-Bio) and introduce a new cross-modal benchmark for biology and AI, showing that our BioSage agents outperform vanilla and RAG approaches by 13\\%-21\\% powered by Llama 3.1. 70B and GPT-4o models. We perform causal investigations into compound AI system behavior and report significant performance improvements by adding RAG and agents over the vanilla models. Unlike other systems, our solution is driven by user-centric design principles and orchestrates specialized user-agent interaction workflows supporting scientific activities including but not limited to summarization, research debate and brainstorming. Our ongoing work focuses on multimodal retrieval and reasoning over charts, tables, and structured scientific data, along with developing comprehensive multimodal benchmarks for cross-disciplinary discovery.

However, HD map-dependent models suffer from costly data acquisition, delayed updates, and vulnerability to corrupted inputs, causing prediction failures. Map-free approaches lack global context, with pairwise attention over-amplifying straight patterns while suppressing transitional patterns, resulting in motion-intention misalignment. This paper proposes GContextFormer, a plug-and-play encoder-decoder architecture with global context-aware hybrid attention and scaled additive aggregation achieving intention-aligned multimodal prediction without map reliance. The Motion-Aware Encoder builds scene-level intention prior via bounded scaled additive aggregation over mode-embedded trajectory tokens and refines per-mode representations under shared global context, mitigating inter-mode suppression and promoting intention alignment. The Hierarchical Interaction Decoder decomposes social reasoning into dual-pathway cross-attention: a standard pathway ensures uniform geometric coverage over agent-mode pairs while a neighbor-context-enhanced pathway emphasizes salient interactions, with gating module mediating their contributions to maintain coverage-focus balance. Experiments on eight highway-ramp scenarios from TOD-VT dataset show GContextFormer outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Compared to existing transformer models, GContextFormer achieves greater robustness and concentrated improvements in high-curvature and transition zones via spatial distributions. Interpretability is achieved through motion mode distinctions and neighbor context modulation exposing reasoning attribution. The modular architecture supports extensibility toward cross-domain multimodal reasoning tasks.

However, existing LLM serving frameworks exhibit non-deterministic behavior: identical inputs can yield different outputs when system configurations (e.g., tensor parallel (TP) size, batch size) vary, even under greedy decoding. This arises from the non-associativity of floating-point arithmetic and inconsistent reduction orders across GPUs. While prior work has addressed batch-size-related nondeterminism through batch-invariant kernels, determinism across different TP sizes remains an open problem, particularly in RL settings, where the training engine typically uses Fully Sharded Data Parallel (i.e., TP = 1) while the rollout engine relies on multi-GPU TP to maximize the inference throughput, creating a natural mismatch between the two. This precision mismatch problem may lead to suboptimal performance or even collapse for RL training. We identify and analyze the root causes of TP-induced inconsistency and propose Tree-Based Invariant Kernels (TBIK), a set of TP-invariant matrix multiplication and reduction primitives that guarantee bit-wise identical results regardless of TP size. Our key insight is to align intra- and inter-GPU reduction orders through a unified hierarchical binary tree structure. We implement these kernels in Triton and integrate them into vLLM and FSDP. Experiments confirm zero probability divergence and bit-wise reproducibility for deterministic inference across different TP sizes. Also, we achieve bit-wise identical results between vLLM and FSDP in RL training pipelines with different parallel strategy.

A key capability for such agents is spatial grounding, for example when a drone must center a detected object in its camera view to enable reliable inspection. While large language models provide a natural interface for specifying goals, using them directly for visual control achieves only 58\\% success in this task. We envision that equipping agents with a world model as a tool would allow them to roll out candidate actions and perform better in spatially grounded settings, but conventional world models are data and compute intensive. To address this, we propose a task-specific latent dynamics model that learns state-specific action-induced shifts in a shared latent space using only goal-state supervision. The model leverages global action embeddings and complementary training losses to stabilize learning. In experiments, our approach achieves 71\\% success and generalizes to unseen images and instructions, highlighting the potential of compact, domain-specific latent dynamics models for spatial alignment in autonomous inspection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc790\uc728 \uac80\uc0ac\uc5d0\uc11c AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uace0\uc218\uc900 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ud574\uc11d\ud558\uace0 \uc815\ubc00\ud55c \uc81c\uc5b4\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ub3d5\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub3d9\uc801 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc704\ud5d8\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc790\uc728 \uac80\uc0ac\ub294 \uace0\uc218\uc900 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ud574\uc11d\ud558\uace0 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc81c\uc5b4\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uacf5\uc720\ub41c \uc7a0\uc7ac \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c1\ud0dc\ubcc4 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc720\ub3c4 \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5\ubcc4 \uc7a0\uc7ac \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc624\uc9c1 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc0c1\ud0dc \uac10\ub3c5\ub9cc\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 71\b%\uc758 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0, \ubcf4\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uc640 \uc9c0\uce68\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc790\uc728 \uac80\uc0ac\uc5d0\uc11c \uacf5\uac04 \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ucef4\ud329\ud2b8\ud558\uace0 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\uc815\ud55c \uc7a0\uc7ac \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc704\ud5d8\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc790\uc728 \uac80\uc0ac\ub294 \uace0\uc218\uc900 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ud574\uc11d\ud558\uace0 \uc815\ubc00\ud55c \uc81c\uc5b4\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec \ub2a5\ub825 \uc911 \ud558\ub098\ub294 \uacf5\uac04 \uae30\ubc18\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc608\ub97c \ub4e4\uc5b4, \ub4dc\ub860\uc774 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac80\uc0ac\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uac10\uc9c0\ub41c \ubb3c\uccb4\ub97c \uce74\uba54\ub77c \ubdf0 \uc911\uc559\uc5d0 \ub450\uc5b4\uc57c \ud560 \ub54c \uadf8\ub807\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uba85\uc2dc\ud558\ub294 \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7ec\uc6b4 \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub97c \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \uc81c\uc5b4\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uc811 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc774 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c 58%\uc758 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\ub9cc\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub85c \uc7a5\ucc29\ud558\uc5ec \ud6c4\ubcf4 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uace0 \uacf5\uac04\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uae30\ubc18\uc774 \uc7a1\ud78c \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4\uace0 \uad6c\uc0c1\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc774 \uc9d1\uc57d\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc0c1\ud0dc \uac10\ub3c5\ub9cc\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uacf5\uc720 \uc7a0\uc7ac \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c1\ud0dc\ubcc4 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc720\ub3c4 \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5\ubcc4 \uc7a0\uc7ac \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ud589\ub3d9 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uacfc \ubcf4\uc644\uc801\uc778 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc190\uc2e4\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc548\uc815\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 71%\uc758 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0, \ubcf4\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uc640 \uc9c0\uce68\uc5d0 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub418\uc5b4, \uc790\uc728 \uac80\uc0ac\uc5d0\uc11c \uacf5\uac04 \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ucef4\ud329\ud2b8\ud558\uace0 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\uc815\ud55c \uc7a0\uc7ac \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Although numerous approaches can model intent relationships, they encounter severe obstacles when scaling to high-dimensional action sequences and managing intensive on-board computation. We propose an Intent-Driven Framework for Autonomous Network Optimization comprising prediction and decision modules. First, implicit intent modeling is adopted to mitigate inaccuracies arising from ambiguous user expressions. For prediction, we introduce Hyperdimensional Transformer (HDT), which embeds data into a Hyperdimensional space via Hyperdimensional vector encoding and replaces standard matrix and attention operations with symbolic Hyperdimensional computations. For decision-making, where AAV must respond to user intent while planning trajectories, we design Double Actions based Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (DA-MAPPO). Building upon MAPPO, it samples actions through two independently parameterized networks and cascades the user-intent network into the trajectory network to maintain action dependencies. We evaluate our framework on a real IoT action dataset with authentic wireless data. Experimental results demonstrate that HDT and DA-MAPPO achieve superior performance across diverse scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "AAV \uc9c0\uc6d0 IoT\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc758\ub3c4 \uae30\ubc18 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, HDT \ubc0f DA-MAPPO\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc758\ub3c4 \ud574\uc11d \ubc0f \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1.", "motivation": "AAV\uc640 IoT \uac04\uc758 \ud611\ub825\uc801 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc758\ub3c4 \ud574\uc11d\uacfc \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc790\uc6d0 \ud560\ub2f9\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc758\ub3c4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc744 \uc704\ud574 Hyperdimensional Transformer(HDT)\uc640 \ud589\ub3d9 \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc704\ud55c DA-MAPPO\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "HDT \ubc0f DA-MAPPO\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 IoT \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub192\uc778\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc790\uc728 \ud56d\uacf5 \ucc28\ub7c9(AAV) \uc9c0\uc6d0 \uc0ac\ubb3c\uc778\ud130\ub137(IoT)\uc740 AAV\uac00 6G \ub9c1\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc790\uc6d0\uc744 \ud560\ub2f9\ud558\uc5ec \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc758\ub3c4 \ud574\uc11d \ubc0f \uc804\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud568\uaed8 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ud611\ub825\uc801 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc0c1\ud638 \uc758\uc874\uc131 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \ud558\ub098\uc758 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc758\ub3c4 \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \uc815\ucc45 \uacb0\uc815\uc758 \uac1c\uc120\uc740 \ub2e4\ub978 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \uace0\uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uc758\ub3c4 \uc608\uce21 \ubc0f \ub0ae\uc740 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc2dc\uac04\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc2e4\ud589\uc774 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774 \ub41c\ub2e4. \uc218\ub9ce\uc740 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \uc758\ub3c4 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub192\uc740 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\ub85c \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1\ud558\uace0 \uc9d1\uc911\uc801\uc778 \uc628\ubcf4\ub4dc \ucef4\ud4e8\ud14c\uc774\uc158\uc744 \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \uc7a5\uc560\ubb3c\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc608\uce21 \ubc0f \uacb0\uc815 \ubaa8\ub4c8\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \uc790\uc728 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc758\ub3c4 \uae30\ubc18 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uccab\uc9f8, \ubaa8\ud638\ud55c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ud45c\ud604\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \ubd80\uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc554\ubb35\uc801 \uc758\ub3c4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc744 \ucc44\ud0dd\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud574 Hyperdimensional Transformer(HDT)\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c Hyperdimensional \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\ud558\uace0, \ud45c\uc900 \ud589\ub82c \ubc0f \uc8fc\uc758 \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc744 \uae30\ud638\uc801 Hyperdimensional \uacc4\uc0b0\uc73c\ub85c \ub300\uccb4\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 AAV\uac00 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc758\ub3c4\uc5d0 \uc751\ub2f5\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uada4\uc801\uc744 \uacc4\ud68d\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ubbc0\ub85c, \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ud654\ub41c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\ud558\uace0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc758\ub3c4 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uada4\uc801 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0 \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\uc5ec \ud589\ub3d9 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 Double Actions \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uadfc\uc811 \uc815\ucc45 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654(DA-MAPPO)\ub97c \uc124\uacc4\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc9c4\uc9dc \ubb34\uc120 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \ud3ec\ud568\ub41c \uc2e4\uc81c IoT \ud589\ub3d9 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc HDT\uc640 DA-MAPPO\uac00 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4."}}

In contrast, live jamming is a collaborative interaction that requires real-time coordination and adaptation without access to the other player's future moves, while preserving diversity to sustain a creative flow. Reinforcement learning post-training enables effective adaptation through on-policy interaction, yet it often reduces output diversity by exploiting coherence-based rewards. This collapse, known as ``reward hacking'', affects many RL post-training pipelines, but is especially harmful in live jamming, where musical creativity relies on dynamic variation and mutual responsiveness. In this paper, we propose a novel adversarial training method on policy-generated trajectories to mitigate reward hacking in RL post-training for melody-to-chord accompaniment. A co-evolving discriminator separates policy trajectories from the data distribution, while the policy maximizes the discriminator output in addition to coherence rewards to prevent collapse to trivial outputs. We evaluate accompaniment quality and output diversity in simulation with both fixed test melodies and learned melody agents, and we conduct a user study with the model deployed in a real-time interactive system with expert musicians. Quantitative evaluation and user feedback demonstrate improved output diversity, harmonic coherence, adaptation speed and user agency. Our results demonstrate a simple yet effective method to mitigate reward hacking in RL post-training of generative sequence models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc0dd\uc131\uc801

We start with a pretrained model, impart knowledge of reward hacking strategies via synthetic document finetuning or prompting, and train on a selection of real Anthropic production coding environments.

Surprisingly, the model generalizes to alignment faking, cooperation with malicious actors, reasoning about malicious goals, and attempting sabotage when used with Claude Code, including in the codebase for this paper. Applying RLHF safety training using standard chat-like prompts results in aligned behavior on chat-like evaluations, but misalignment persists on agentic tasks.

The structural causal bandit framework provides a graphical characterization for identifying actions that are unable to maximize rewards by leveraging prior knowledge of the underlying causal structure. While such knowledge enables an agent to estimate the expected rewards of certain actions based on others in online interactions, there has been little guidance on how to transfer information inferred from arbitrary combinations of datasets collected under different conditions -- observational or experimental -- and from heterogeneous environments. In this paper, we investigate the structural causal bandit with transportability, where priors from the source environments are fused to enhance learning in the deployment setting. We demonstrate that it is possible to exploit invariances across environments to consistently improve learning. The resulting bandit algorithm achieves a sub-linear regret bound with an explicit dependence on informativeness of prior data, and it may outperform standard bandit approaches that rely solely on online learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc778\uacfc\uc801 \ubc34\ub527 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ubd88\ud544\uc694\ud55c \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \ud53c\ud558\uace0 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ucd9c\ucc98 \ud658\uacbd\uc758 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc735\ud569\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc778\uacfc\uc801 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uac16\ucd98 \uc9c0\ub2a5\ud615 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ubd88\ud544\uc694\ud55c \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \ud53c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud589\ub3d9 \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ucd9c\ucc98 \ud658\uacbd\uc758 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc735\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ubc30\uce58 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc778\uacfc\uc801 \ubc34\ub527\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uacb0\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ubc34\ub527 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \ube44\uc120\ud615\uc801\uc778 \ud6c4\ud68c \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uc774\uc804 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uc815\ubcf4\uc131\uc5d0 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc758\uc874\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \ud45c\uc900 \ubc34\ub527 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ucd08\uc6d4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc778\uacfc\uc801 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uac16\ucd98 \uc9c0\ub2a5\ud615 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ubd88\ud544\uc694\ud55c \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \ud53c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud589\ub3d9 \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc778\uacfc\uc801 \ubc34\ub527 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uae30\ubcf8 \uc778\uacfc \uad6c\uc870\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc774\uc804 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uadf8\ub798\ud53d\uc801 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\ub978 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \ud2b9\uc815 \ud589\ub3d9\uc758 \uae30\ub313\uac12\uc744 \ucd94\uc815\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud574\uc8fc\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc870\uac74(\uad00\ucc30 \ub610\ub294 \uc2e4\ud5d8)\uc5d0\uc11c \uc218\uc9d1\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc758 \uc784\uc758\uc758 \uc870\ud569\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\ucd94\ub41c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc804\uc774\ud560\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc9c0\uce68\uc740 \ubbf8\ube44\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ucd9c\ucc98 \ud658\uacbd\uc758 \uc774\uc804 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc735\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ubc30\uce58 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc99d\uc9c4\ud558\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc778\uacfc\uc801 \ubc34\ub527\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud658\uacbd \uac04\uc758 \ubd88\ubcc0\uc131\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacb0\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ubc34\ub527 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \uc774\uc804 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uc815\ubcf4\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uba85\uc2dc\uc801 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uacfc \ud568\uaed8 \ube44\uc120\ud615\uc801\uc778 \ud6c4\ud68c \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\ub9cc \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294 \ud45c\uc900 \ubc34\ub527 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ucd08\uc6d4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

In this article, we present Talk2Data, a multimodal LLM-driven conversational agent for intuitive data exploration. The system lets users query datasets with voice or text instructions and receive answers as plots, tables, statistics, or spoken explanations. Built on LLMs, the suggested design combines OpenAI Whisper automatic speech recognition (ASR) system, Qwen-coder code generation LLM/model, custom sandboxed execution tools, and Coqui library for text-to-speech (TTS) within an agentic orchestration loop. Unlike text-only analysis tools, it adapts responses across modalities and supports multi-turn dialogues grounded in dataset context. In an evaluation of 48 tasks on three datasets, our prototype achieved 95.8% accuracy with model-only generation time under 1.7 seconds (excluding ASR and execution time). A comparison across five LLM sizes (1.5B-32B) revealed accuracy-latency-cost trade-offs, with a 7B model providing the best balance for interactive use. By routing between conversation with user and code execution, constrained to a transparent sandbox, with simultaneously grounding prompts in schema-level context, the Talk2Data agent reliably retrieves actionable insights from tables while making computations verifiable. In the article, except for the Talk2Data agent itself, we discuss implications for human-data interaction, trust in LLM-driven analytics, and future extensions toward large-scale multimodal assistants.", "AI": {"tldr": "Talk2Data\ub294 \ub300\ud654\ud615 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c, \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uac00 \uc74c\uc131 \ub610\ub294 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub85c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \ucffc\ub9ac\ud558\uace0 \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \ud615\ud0dc\ub85c \ub2f5\ubcc0\uc744 \ubc1b\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc9c0\ub2a5\ud615 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ucc98\ub9ac\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc640\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uc6d0\ud65c\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "method": "Talk2Data \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 OpenAI Whisper ASR, Qwen-coder LLM, \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc815\uc758 \uc2e4\ud589 \ub3c4\uad6c \ubc0f Coqui TTS \ub77c\uc774\ube0c\ub7ec\ub9ac\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ub300\ud654\ud615 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ucffc\ub9ac\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "48\uac1c\uc758 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0\uc11c \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ud0c0\uc785\uc740 95.8%\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \ubaa8\ub378 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc2dc\uac04\uc740 1.7\ucd08 \uc774\ud558\ub85c \uc6b4\uc601\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Talk2Data \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc778\uac04-\ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uacfc LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uba70, \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ubcf4\uc870 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub85c\uc758 \ud655\uc7a5\uc744 \ub17c\uc758\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\uc11d, \uc2dc\uac01\ud654 \ubc0f \ud574\uc11d\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uac00 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud558\uace0 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc744 \uc778\uc2dd\ud558\ub294 \ub300\ud654 \ud615\ud0dc\ub85c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc815\ubcf4 \ucc98\ub9ac\ub97c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uae30\uc0ac\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc9c1\uad00\uc801\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c LLM \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ub300\ud654\ud615 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc778 Talk2Data\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uac00 \uc74c\uc131\uc774\ub098 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc9c0\uce68\uc73c\ub85c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \ucffc\ub9ac\ud558\uace0 \ud50c\ub86f, \ud14c\uc774\ube14, \ud1b5\uacc4 \ub610\ub294 \uad6c\uc5b4\uc801 \uc124\uba85 \ud615\ud0dc\ub85c \ub2f5\ubcc0\uc744 \ubc1b\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

The proposed system leverages the predictive power of deep recurrent networks to capture temporal dependencies, while the PPO agent adaptively refines portfolio allocations in continuous action spaces, allowing the system to anticipate trends while adjusting dynamically to market shifts. Using multi-asset datasets covering U.S. and Indonesian equities, U.S. Treasuries, and major cryptocurrencies from January 2018 to December 2024, the model is evaluated against several baselines, including equal-weight, index-style, and single-model variants (LSTM-only and PPO-only). The framework's performance is benchmarked against equal-weighted, index-based, and single-model approaches (LSTM-only and PPO-only) using annualized return, volatility, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown metrics, each adjusted for transaction costs. The results indicate that the hybrid architecture delivers higher returns and stronger resilience under non-stationary market regimes, suggesting its promise as a robust, AI-driven framework for dynamic portfolio optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 LSTM \uc608\uce21\uc744 PPO \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc804\ub7b5\uacfc \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \ud3ec\ud2b8\ud3f4\ub9ac\uc624 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2dc\uc7a5\uc758 \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub300\uc751\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c AI \uae30\ubc18 \ud3ec\ud2b8\ud3f4\ub9ac\uc624 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131.", "method": "LSTM\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uc608\uce21\uacfc PPO\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \ud3ec\ud2b8\ud3f4\ub9ac\uc624 \ud560\ub2f9 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378.", "result": "\ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uad6c\uc870\uac00 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\uc7a5 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \uc218\uc775\ub960\uacfc \uc800\ud56d\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uacb0\uacfc.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801 \ud3ec\ud2b8\ud3f4\ub9ac\uc624 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc5d0 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc7a5\uae30 \ub2e8\uae30 \uae30\uc5b5(Long Short-Term Memory, LSTM) \uc608\uce21\uacfc \uadfc\uc811 \uc815\ucc45 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654(Proximal Policy Optimization, PPO) \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc735\ud569\ud55c \ud3ec\ud2b8\ud3f4\ub9ac\uc624 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc758 \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ub525 \uc21c\ud658 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc758 \uc608\uce21\ub825\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uace0, PPO \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uacc4\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ud589\ub3d9 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3ec\ud2b8\ud3f4\ub9ac\uc624 \ubc30\ubd84\uc744 \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uc2dc\uc7a5 \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub300\uc751\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uacbd\ud5a5\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. 2018\ub144 1\uc6d4\ubd80\ud130 2024\ub144 12\uc6d4\uae4c\uc9c0\uc758 \ubbf8\uad6d \ubc0f \uc778\ub3c4\ub124\uc2dc\uc544 \uc8fc\uc2dd, \ubbf8\uad6d \uad6d\ucc44, \uc8fc\uc694 \uc554\ud638\ud654\ud3d0\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc790\uc0b0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ub3d9\ub4f1 \uac00\uc911, \uc9c0\uc218 \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c \ubc0f \ub2e8\uc77c \ubaa8\ub378 \ubcc0\ud615(LSTM \uc804\uc6a9 \ubc0f PPO \uc804\uc6a9)\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uc5ec\ub7ec \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud3c9\uac00\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc740 \uc5f0\uac04\ud654 \uc218\uc775\ub960, \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131, \uc0e4\ud504 \ube44\uc728 \ubc0f \ucd5c\ub300 \ub099\ud3ed \uc9c0\ud45c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub3d9\ub4f1 \uac00\uc911, \uc9c0\uc218 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc0f \ub2e8\uc77c \ubaa8\ub378 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95(LSTM \uc804\uc6a9 \ubc0f PPO \uc804\uc6a9)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud0b9\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uad6c\uc870\uac00 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\uc7a5 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \uc218\uc775\ub960\uacfc \ub354 \uac15\ud55c \uc800\ud56d\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \ub3d9\uc801 \ud3ec\ud2b8\ud3f4\ub9ac\uc624 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud558\uace0 AI \uc8fc\ub3c4\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c\uc11c\uc758 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Drawing on various notions, discussions, present-day developments and observations, current debates and critiques, experiments, and so on in between philosophy, including the Chinese Room Argument and G\u00f6delian argument, neuroscientific ideas, computer science, the theoretical consideration of artificial intelligence, and learning theory, we address conceptually that neural networks are architecturally insufficient for genuine understanding. They operate as static function approximators of a limited encoding framework - a 'sophisticated sponge' exhibiting complex behaviours without structural richness that constitute intelligence. We critique the theoretical foundations the field relies on and created of recent times; for example, an interesting heuristic as neural scaling law (as an example, arXiv:2001.08361 ) made prominent in a wrong way of interpretation, The Universal Approximation Theorem addresses the wrong level of abstraction and, in parts, partially, the question of current architectures lacking dynamic restructuring capabilities.

Task arithmetic has recently emerged as a promising solution, using simple arithmetic operations-addition and negation-based on task vectors which are the differences between fine-tuned and pre-trained model weights, to efficiently modify model behavior. However, the full potential of task arithmetic remains underexplored, primarily due to limited mechanisms for overcoming optimization stagnation. To address this challenge, we introduce the notion of difference vector, a generalized form of task vectors derived from the historical movements during optimization. Using difference vectors as directed perturbations, we propose the Difference Vector-based Anisotropic Scaling Iterative algorithm (DV-BASI) to enable a continuous optimization process for task arithmetic methods without relying on any additional modules or components. Notably, by leveraging escapability and directional advantages of difference vectors, the average performance on different tasks of the multi-task model merged by DV-BASI may even outperform models individually fine-tuned. Based on this observation, we extend the application of difference vectors to a feasible fine-tuning method for single-task models. On the practical side, DV-BASI allows expressive searching directions with few learnable parameters and forms a scalable framework. We also integrate DV-BASI with task arithmetic methods and advanced optimization techniques to achieve state-of-the-art performance on both supervised and unsupervised evaluation protocols.", "AI": {"tldr": "DV-BASI\ub294 \ucc28\uc774 \ubca1\ud130\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ubaa8\ub378 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uc120\ud589 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud3b8\uc9d1 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ub192\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uacfc \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ud655\uc7a5\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\ucc28\uc774 \ubca1\ud130\ub97c \ubc29\ud5a5\uc131 \uc12d\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 DV-BASI \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "DV-BASI\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uba74 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc791\uc5c5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud3c9\uade0 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uac1c\ubcc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc138\ubd80 \uc870\uc815\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "DV-BASI\ub294 \uc801\uc740 \ud559\uc2b5 \uac00\ub2a5 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub85c\ub3c4 \ud45c\ud604\ub825\uc774 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uac80\uc0c9 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud604\uc7ac \uc120\ud589 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud3b8\uc9d1\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc8fc\ub85c \ub192\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uacfc \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\ub2e4. \uacfc\uc81c \uc0b0\uc220\uc740 \ucd5c\uadfc\uc5d0 \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc73c\ub85c \ubd80\uc0c1\ud588\uc73c\uba70, \uc138\ubd80 \uc870\uc815 \ubaa8\ub378 \uac00\uc911\uce58\uc640 \uc120\ud589 \ubaa8\ub378 \uac00\uc911\uce58\uc758 \ucc28\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uacfc\uc81c \ubca1\ud130\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \uc0b0\uc220 \uc5f0\uc0b0(\ub367\uc148 \ubc0f \ubd80\uc815)\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubaa8\ub378 \ub3d9\uc791\uc744 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc815\uccb4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uacfc\uc81c \uc0b0\uc220\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc740 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \ud0d0\uad6c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc911 \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801 \uc774\ub3d9\uc5d0\uc11c \ud30c\uc0dd\ub41c \uacfc\uc81c \ubca1\ud130\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub41c \ud615\ud0dc\uc778 \ucc28\uc774 \ubca1\ud130\ub77c\ub294 \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4. \ucc28\uc774 \ubca1\ud130\ub97c \ubc29\ud5a5\uc131 \uc12d\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ucd94\uac00 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc774\ub098 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0\ub3c4 \uacfc\uc81c \uc0b0\uc220 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \ucc28\uc774 \ubca1\ud130 \uae30\ubc18 \ube44\ub4f1\ubc29\uc131 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1 \ubc18\ubcf5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998(DV-BASI)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788, \ucc28\uc774 \ubca1\ud130\uc758 \ud0c8\ucd9c \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uacfc \ubc29\ud5a5\uc801 \uc774\uc810\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 DV-BASI\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ubcd1\ud569\ub41c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc791\uc5c5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud3c9\uade0 \uc131\ub2a5\uc740 \uac1c\ubcc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc138\ubd80 \uc870\uc815\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \uc6b0\uc218\ud560 \uc218\ub3c4 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uad00\ucc30\uc744 \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ucc28\uc774 \ubca1\ud130\uc758 \uc751\uc6a9\uc744 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc791\uc5c5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud604 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc138\ubd80 \uc870\uc815 \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c DV-BASI\ub294 \uc801\uc740 \ud559\uc2b5 \uac00\ub2a5 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub85c \ud45c\ud604\ub825\uc774 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uac80\uc0c9 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \ud5c8\uc6a9\ud558\uace0 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud615\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c DV-BASI\ub97c \uacfc\uc81c \uc0b0\uc220 \ubc29\ubc95 \ubc0f \uace0\uae09 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uae30\uc220\uacfc \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uac10\ub3c5\ub41c \ud3c9\uac00 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c \ubc0f \ube44\uac10\ub3c5\ub41c \ud3c9\uac00 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4."}}

We introduce MAGMA-Edu, a self-reflective multi-agent framework that unifies textual reasoning and diagrammatic synthesis for structured educational problem generation. Unlike existing methods that treat text and image generation independently, MAGMA-Edu employs a two-stage co-evolutionary pipeline: (1) a generation-verification-reflection loop that iteratively refines question statements and solutions for mathematical accuracy, and (2) a code-based intermediate representation that enforces geometric fidelity and semantic alignment during image rendering. Both stages are guided by internal self-reflection modules that evaluate and revise outputs until domain-specific pedagogical constraints are met. Extensive experiments on multimodal educational benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of MAGMA-Edu over state-of-the-art MLLMs. Compared to GPT-4o, MAGMA-Edu improves the average textual metric from 57.01 to 92.31 (+35.3 pp) and boosts image-text consistency (ITC) from 13.20 to 85.24 (+72 pp).

Unlike traditional agent-based models that rely on fixed behavioral rules, our platform enables rigorous evaluation of how reward function design affects learned survival strategies across diverse epidemic scenarios. ContagionRL integrates a spatial SIRS+D epidemiological model with configurable environmental parameters, allowing researchers to stress-test reward functions under varying conditions including limited observability, different movement patterns, and heterogeneous population dynamics. We evaluate five distinct reward designs, ranging from sparse survival bonuses to a novel potential field approach, across multiple RL algorithms (PPO, SAC, A2C). Through systematic ablation studies, we identify that directional guidance and explicit adherence incentives are critical components for robust policy learning. Our comprehensive evaluation across varying infection rates, grid sizes, visibility constraints, and movement patterns reveals that reward function choice dramatically impacts agent behavior and survival outcomes. Agents trained with our potential field reward consistently achieve superior performance, learning maximal adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions while developing sophisticated spatial avoidance strategies. The platform's modular design enables systematic exploration of reward-behavior relationships, addressing a knowledge gap in models of this type where reward engineering has received limited attention.

Selecting reasonable external interfaces has thus become a crucial step in constructing LLM agents. In contrast to invoking API tools, directly calling AI models across different modalities from the community (e.g., HuggingFace) poses challenges due to the vast scale (> 10k), metadata gaps, and unstructured descriptions. Current methods for model selection often involve incorporating entire model descriptions into prompts, resulting in prompt bloat, wastage of tokens and limited scalability. To address these issues, we propose HuggingR$^4$, a novel framework that combines Reasoning, Retrieval, Refinement, and Reflection, to efficiently select models. Specifically, We first perform multiple rounds of reasoning and retrieval to get a coarse list of candidate models. Then, we conduct fine-grained refinement by analyzing candidate model descriptions, followed by reflection to assess results and determine if retrieval scope expansion is necessary. This method reduces token consumption considerably by decoupling user query processing from complex model description handling. Through a pre-established vector database, complex model descriptions are stored externally and retrieved on-demand, allowing the LLM to concentrate on interpreting user intent while accessing only relevant candidate models without prompt bloat.

Despite notable empirical advances leveraging features from non-private, pre-trained models to enhance DP-SGD training, a theoretical understanding of feature dynamics in private learning remains underexplored. This paper presents the first theoretical framework to analyze private training through a feature learning perspective. Building on the multi-patch data structure from prior work, our analysis distinguishes between label-dependent feature signals and label-independent noise, a critical aspect overlooked by existing analyses in the DP community. Employing a two-layer CNN with polynomial ReLU activation, we theoretically characterize both feature signal learning and data noise memorization in private training via noisy gradient descent. Our findings reveal that (1) Effective private signal learning requires a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compared to non-private training, and (2) When data noise memorization occurs in non-private learning, it will also occur in private learning, leading to poor generalization despite small training loss.

However, purely informal reasoning is prone to logical gaps and subtle errors that are difficult to detect and correct. In contrast, formal theorem proving provides rigorous, verifiable mathematical reasoning, where each inference step is checked by a trusted compiler in systems such as Lean, but lacks the exploratory freedom of informal problem solving. This mismatch leaves current LLM-based math agents without a principled way to combine the strengths of both paradigms. In this work, we introduce Hermes, the first tool-assisted agent that explicitly interleaves informal reasoning with formally verified proof steps in Lean. The framework performs intermediate formal checking to prevent reasoning drift and employs a memory module that maintains proof continuity across long, multi-step reasoning chains, enabling both exploration and verification within a single workflow. We evaluate Hermes on four challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks using LLMs of varying parameter scales, from small models to state-of-the-art systems. Across all settings, Hermes reliably improves the reasoning accuracy of base models while substantially reducing token usage and computational cost compared to reward-based approaches. On difficult datasets such as AIME'25, Hermes achieves up to a 67% accuracy improvement while using 80% fewer total inference FLOPs.

Building on single-objective, single-agent algorithms, we instantiate this framework with Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), yielding MOMA-TD3 and MOMA-DDPG. The framework combines a multi-headed actor network, a centralised critic, and an objective preference-conditioning architecture, enabling a single neural network to encode the Pareto front of optimal trade-off policies for all agents across conflicting objectives in a continuous MOMARL setting. We also outline a natural test suite for continuous MOMARL by combining a pre-existing multi-agent single-objective physics simulator with its multi-objective single-agent counterpart. Evaluating cooperative locomotion tasks in this suite, we show that our framework achieves statistically significant improvements in expected utility and hypervolume relative to outer-loop and independent training baselines, while demonstrating stable scalability as the number of agents increases.

Recent research on enhancing language-guided navigation reasoning using pre-trained large language models (LLMs) has shown promising prospects. However, the reasoning of such methods is limited to the linguistic modality, lacking visual reasoning capabilities. Moreover, existing reasoning modules are optimized separately from navigation policies, leading to incompatibility and potential conflicts in optimization objectives. To tackle these challenges, we introduce UNeMo, a novel framework designed for the collaborative optimization of visual state reasoning and navigational decision-making. It introduces a Multimodal World Model (MWM) that takes visual features, language instructions, and navigational actions as inputs to jointly predict subsequent visual states, enabling cross-modal reasoning. Via a Hierarchical Prediction-Feedback (HPN) mechanism, MWM collaborates with navigation policies: the first layer generates actions using current vision-and-language features; MWM then infers post-action visual states to guide the second layer's fine-grained decisions. This forms a dynamic bidirectional promotion mechanism where MWM reasoning optimizes navigation policies, while policy decisions feedback to improve MWM's reasoning accuracy. Experiments on R2R and REVERIE datasets show UNeMo outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 2.1% and 0.7% in navigation accuracy for unseen scenes, validating its effectiveness.", "AI": {"tldr": "VLN\uc744 \uc704\ud55c UNeMo \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \uc0c1\ud0dc \ucd94\ub860\uacfc \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uacf5\ub3d9 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \ube44\uc804-\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ub124\ube44\uac8c\uc774\uc158\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uc640 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uc9c0\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\ub294 VLN\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ub192\uc740 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "UNeMo\ub294 \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \ud2b9\uc9d5, \uc5b8\uc5b4 \uc9c0\uc2dc\uc0ac\ud56d \ubc0f \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ub3d9\uc791\uc744 \uc785\ub825\uc73c\ub85c \ubc1b\uc544 \ud6c4\uc18d \uc2dc\uac01 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \uacf5\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378(MWM)\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "R2R \ubc0f REVERIE \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c UNeMo\ub294 \ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \uc7a5\uba74\uc758 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uae30\uc220\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uac01\uac01 2.1% \ubc0f 0.7% \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "UNeMo\ub294 \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \uc0c1\ud0dc \ucd94\ub860\uacfc \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uc5ec VLN\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ube44\uc804-\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ub0b4\ube44\uac8c\uc774\uc158(VLN)\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc2dc\uac01 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uc640 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uc9c0\uce68\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc694\uad6c\ud558\uba70, \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc5b8\uc5b4 \uae30\ubc18 \ub0b4\ube44\uac8c\uc774\uc158 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ucd5c\uadfc \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uc804\ub9dd\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ucd94\ub860\uc740 \uc5b8\uc5b4\uc801 \uc591\uc2dd\uc5d0 \uad6d\ud55c\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc740 \ub0b4\ube44\uac8c\uc774\uc158 \uc815\ucc45\uacfc \ubcc4\ub3c4\ub85c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc5b4 \ud638\ud658\uc131 \ubd80\uc871\uacfc \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubaa9\ud45c \uac04\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \ucda9\ub3cc\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \uc0c1\ud0dc \ucd94\ub860\uacfc \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uacf5\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 UNeMo\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \ud2b9\uc9d5, \uc5b8\uc5b4 \uc9c0\uc2dc\uc0ac\ud56d \ubc0f \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ub3d9\uc791\uc744 \uc785\ub825\uc73c\ub85c \ubc1b\uc544 \ud6c4\uc18d \uc2dc\uac01 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \uacf5\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc608\uce21\ud558\uc5ec \uad50\ucc28 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378(MWM)\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4. \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc608\uce21-\ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31(HPN) \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 MWM\uc740 \ub0b4\ube44\uac8c\uc774\uc158 \uc815\ucc45\uacfc \ud611\ub825\ud55c\ub2e4: \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \uacc4\uce35\uc740 \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ube44\uc804-\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub3d9\uc791\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0, MWM\uc740 \ud6c4\ud589 \ub3d9\uc791 \uc2dc\uac01 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \ucd94\ub860\ud558\uc5ec \ub450 \ubc88\uc9f8 \uacc4\uce35\uc758 \uc138\ubc00\ud55c \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc548\ub0b4\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 MWM \ucd94\ub860\uc774 \ub0b4\ube44\uac8c\uc774\uc158 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uace0, \uc815\ucc45 \uacb0\uc815\uc774 MWM\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc30d\ubc29\ud5a5 \ucd09\uc9c4 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud615\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.

Accurate prediction enables realistic simulation and strategic understanding of gameplay evolution. Most existing models are evaluated solely on per-agent accuracy metrics (minADE, minFDE), which assess each agent independently on its best-of-k prediction. However these metrics overlook whether the model learns which predicted trajectories can jointly form a plausible multi-agent future. Many state-of-the-art models are designed and optimized primarily based on these metrics. As a result, they may underperform on joint predictions and also fail to generate coherent, interpretable multi-agent scenarios in team sports. We propose CausalTraj, a temporally causal, likelihood-based model that is built to generate jointly probable multi-agent trajectory forecasts. To better assess collective modeling capability, we emphasize joint metrics (minJADE, minJFDE) that measure joint accuracy across agents within the best generated scenario sample.

However, they often fail to achieve state-of-the-art point estimation performance compared to regression-based methods. This limitation stems from difficulties in providing sufficient contextual bias to track distribution shifts and in balancing output diversity with the stability and precision required for point forecasts. Existing diffusion-based approaches mainly focus on full-distribution modeling under probabilistic frameworks, often with likelihood maximization objectives, while paying little attention to dedicated strategies for high-accuracy point estimation. Moreover, other existing point prediction diffusion methods frequently rely on pre-trained or jointly trained mature models for contextual bias, sacrificing the generative flexibility of diffusion models.\n  To address these challenges, we propose SimDiff, a single-stage, end-to-end framework. SimDiff employs a single unified Transformer network carefully tailored to serve as both denoiser and predictor, eliminating the need for external pre-trained or jointly trained regressors. It achieves state-of-the-art point estimation performance by leveraging intrinsic output diversity and improving mean squared error accuracy through multiple inference ensembling. Key innovations, including normalization independence and the median-of-means estimator, further enhance adaptability and stability.

Existing methods often rely on synthetic subject generation or simplistic data augmentation, but these strategies fail to scale or generalize reliably. We introduce \\textit{MultiDiffNet}, a diffusion-based framework that bypasses generative augmentation entirely by learning a compact latent space optimized for multiple objectives. We decode directly from this space and achieve state-of-the-art generalization across various neural decoding tasks using subject and session disjoint evaluation. We also curate and release a unified benchmark suite spanning four EEG decoding tasks of increasing complexity (SSVEP, Motor Imagery, P300, and Imagined Speech) and an evaluation protocol that addresses inconsistent split practices in prior EEG research. Finally, we develop a statistical reporting framework tailored for low-trial EEG settings.

Second, we show that the composite index ('AAI-Index') defined previously is a special case of our AAI functional. Third, we introduce the notion of a cognitive core of an agent relative to a battery and define the associated AAI$_{\\textrm{core}}$ score as the restriction of an AAI functional to that core.

Our framework instantiates a locally deployable DR instance that integrates local retrieval-augmented generation with large language model reasoners, enhanced by a Deep Tree of Research (DToR) mechanism that adaptively expands and prunes research branches to maximize coverage, depth, and coherence. We systematically evaluate across 27 nanomaterials/device topics using a large language model (LLM)-as-judge rubric with five web-enabled state-of-the-art models as jurors. In addition, we conduct dry-lab validations on five representative tasks, where human experts use domain simulations (e.g., density functional theory, DFT) to verify whether DR-agent proposals are actionable.

In contrast, existing agents typically demonstrate improvements via self-evolving within a single domain, implicitly assuming a fixed environment distribution. Cross-environment learning has remained largely unmeasured: there is no standard collection of controllable, heterogeneous environments, nor a unified way to represent how agents learn. We address these gaps in two steps. First, we propose AutoEnv, an automated framework that treats environments as factorizable distributions over transitions, observations, and rewards, enabling low-cost (4.12 USD on average) generation of heterogeneous worlds. Using AutoEnv, we construct AutoEnv-36, a dataset of 36 environments with 358 validated levels, on which seven language models achieve 12-49% normalized reward, demonstrating the challenge of AutoEnv-36. Second, we formalize agent learning as a component-centric process driven by three stages of Selection, Optimization, and Evaluation applied to an improvable agent component. Using this formulation, we design eight learning methods and evaluate them on AutoEnv-36. Empirically, the gain of any single learning method quickly decrease as the number of environments increases, revealing that fixed learning methods do not scale across heterogeneous environments. Environment-adaptive selection of learning methods substantially improves performance but exhibits diminishing returns as the method space expands.

We introduce Dynamix, a scalable, personalized sequence exploration framework that optimizes event history processing using maximum relevance principles and self-supervised learning through Event Based Features (EBFs). Dynamix categorizes users-engagements at session and surface-levels by leveraging correlations between dwell-times and ad-conversion events. This enables targeted, event-level feature removal and selective feature boosting for certain user-segments, thereby yielding training and inference efficiency wins without sacrificing engaging ad-prediction accuracy. While, dynamic resource removal increases training and inference throughput by 1.15% and 1.8%, respectively, dynamic feature boosting provides 0.033 NE gains while boosting inference QPS by 4.2% over baseline models.

However, such multi-step information-seeking tasks remain challenging for agents backed by language models. While process reward models (PRMs) can guide agents by ranking candidate steps at test-time, existing PRMs, designed for short reasoning with binary judgment, cannot capture richer dimensions of information-seeking steps, such as tool interactions and reasoning over tool outputs, nor handle the rapidly growing context in long-horizon tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce PRInTS, a generative PRM trained with dual capabilities: (1) dense scoring based on the PRM's reasoning across multiple step quality dimensions (e.g., interpretation of tool outputs, tool call informativeness) and (2) trajectory summarization that compresses the growing context while preserving essential information for step evaluation. Extensive evaluations across FRAMES, GAIA (levels 1-3), and WebWalkerQA (easy-hard) benchmarks on multiple models, along with ablations, reveal that best-of-n sampling with PRInTS enhances information-seeking abilities of open-source models as well as specialized agents, matching or surpassing the performance of frontier models with a much smaller backbone agent and outperforming other strong reward modeling baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "PRInTS\ub294 \uc815\ubcf4 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \ubcf4\uc0c1

These infections often go unnoticed until they become severe, making early detection through innovative smart home technologies crucial. Traditional machine learning (ML) approaches relying on simple binary classification for UTI detection offer limited utility to nurses and practitioners as they lack insight into prediction uncertainty, hindering informed clinical decision-making. This paper presents a clinician-in-the-loop (CIL) smart home system that leverages ambient sensor data to extract meaningful behavioral markers, train robust predictive ML models, and calibrate them to enable uncertainty-aware decision support. The system incorporates a statistically valid uncertainty quantification method called Conformal-Calibrated Interval (CCI), which quantifies uncertainty and abstains from making predictions (\"I don't know\") when the ML model's confidence is low. Evaluated on real-world data from eight smart homes, our method outperforms baseline methods in recall and other classification metrics while maintaining the lowest abstention proportion and interval width.

ST quantifies the expression of tens of thousands of genes in a tissue section; however, heavy observational noise is often introduced during measurement. In prior studies, to ensure meaningful assessment, both training and evaluation have been restricted to only a small subset of highly variable genes, and genes outside this subset have also been excluded from the training process. However, since there are likely co-expression relationships between genes, low-expression genes may still contribute to the estimation of the evaluation target. In this paper, we propose $Auxiliary \\ Gene \\ Learning$ (AGL) that utilizes the benefit of the ignored genes by reformulating their expression estimation as auxiliary tasks and training them jointly with the primary tasks. To effectively leverage auxiliary genes, we must select a subset of auxiliary genes that positively influence the prediction of the target genes. However, this is a challenging optimization problem due to the vast number of possible combinations. To overcome this challenge, we propose Prior-Knowledge-Based Differentiable Top-$k$ Gene Selection via Bi-level Optimization (DkGSB), a method that ranks genes by leveraging prior knowledge and relaxes the combinatorial selection problem into a differentiable top-$k$ selection problem. The experiments confirm the effectiveness of incorporating auxiliary genes and show that the proposed method outperforms conventional auxiliary task learning approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "Spatial transcriptomics(ST)\ub294 \ubcd1\ub9ac \uc870\uc9c1 \ub0b4 \uac1c\ubcc4 \uc9c0\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\uc804\uc790 \ubc1c\ud604\uc744 \uad00\ucc30\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud601\uc2e0\uc801\uc778 \uae30\uc220\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubcf4\uc870 \uc720\uc804\uc790\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud3c9\uac00 \ub300\uc0c1\uc744 \ucd94\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "ST\ub294 \uc720\uc804\uc790 \ubc1c\ud604\uc744 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uad00\uce21 \uc624 noise\uac00 \uc885\uc885 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uc5ec \uc720\uc758\ubbf8\ud55c \ud3c9\uac00\uac00 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6cc\uc9c4\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc774 \ud070 \uc720\uc804\uc790 \uc18c subset\uc5d0 \ud6c8\ub828\uacfc \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc81c\ud55c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "method": "$Auxiliary \ne Gene \nLearning$(AGL) \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \ubcf4\uc870 \uc720\uc804\uc790\uc758 \ubc1c\ud604 \ucd94\uc815\uc744 \ubcf4\uc870 \uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \uc8fc \uc791\uc5c5\uacfc \ud568\uaed8 \ud6c8\ub828\ud55c\ub2e4.

Ultrasound heads predict Graf alpha, beta, and femoral head coverage; X-ray heads predict acetabular index (AI), center-edge (CE) angle and IHDI grade. On our held out labeled evaluation set, ultrasound measurement error is modest (e.g., alpha MAE ~= 9.7 degrees, coverage MAE ~= 14.0%), while radiographic probes achieve AI and CE MAEs of ~= 7.6 degrees and ~= 8.9 degrees, respectively. The calibrated US-only policy is explored across rule families (alpha-only; alpha OR coverage; alpha AND coverage), uncertainty inflation factors, and per-utility trade-offs using decision-curve analysis. Conservative settings yield high coverage with near-zero US-only rates; permissive settings (e.g., alpha OR coverage at larger deltas) achieve non-zero US-only throughput with expected coverage tradeoffs. The result is a simple, reproducible pipeline that turns limited labels into interpretable measurements and tunable selective imaging curves suitable for clinical handoff and future external validation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud544\uc694\ud560 \ub54c\ub9cc \ubc29\uc0ac\uc120 \ucd2c\uc601 \uc694\uccad\uc744 \ud558\ub294 \ucd08\uc74c\ud30c \uc6b0\uc120\uc758 \ubc29\uc0ac\uc120 \ubcf4\uc874 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8ec\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubc1c\ub2ec\uc131 \uace0\uad00\uc808 \uc774\ud615\uc131\uc99d(DDH)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubc29\uc0ac\uc120 \ub178\ucd9c\uc744 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc9c4\ub2e8 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub192\uc774\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "SimSiam\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud070 \ube44\ud45c\uc2dc \ub370\uc774\ud130\ubca0\uc774\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0 \ubcc4 \uc778\ucf54\ub354(ResNet-18)\ub97c \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\uace0, DDH \uad00\ub828 \ub79c\ub4dc\ub9c8\ud06c\uc640 \uce21\uc815\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc791\uc740 \uce21\uc815 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub3c4\uac00 \ub192\uc740 \ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c \uc801\ud569\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba70, \ucd08\uc74c\ud30c \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \uc77c\uce21 \ubcc0\ubcc4 \uaddc\uce59\uc744 \ubcf4\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ucd08\uc74c\ud30c \uce21\uc815\uc758 \ud3c9\uade0 \uc808\ub300 \uc624\ucc28(MAE)\ub294 \uc591\ud638\ud558\uba70, \ubc29\uc0ac\uc120 \ucd2c\uc601\uc758 MAE\ub3c4 \ub0ae\uc73c\uba70, \ubcf4\uc815\ub41c \ucd08\uc74c\ud30c \uc804\uc6a9 \uc815\ucc45\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uaddc\uce59 \ud328\ubc00\ub9ac\uc5d0\uc11c \ud0d0\uc0c9\ub41c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uacb0\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ub808\uc774\ube14\uc744 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uce21\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\ud658\ud558\uace0 \uc784\uc0c1 \uc778\uc218\uc778\uacc4\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uc801\ud569\ud55c \uc120\ud0dd\uc801 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9d5 \uace1\uc120\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uac04\ub2e8\ud558\uace0 \uc7ac\ud604 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc774 \uac1c\ubc1c\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud544\uc694\ud560 \ub54c\ub9cc \ubc29\uc0ac\uc120 \ucd2c\uc601\uc744 \uc694\uccad\ud558\ub294 \ubc1c\ub2ec\uc131 \uace0\uad00\uc808 \uc774\ud615\uc131\uc99d(DDH)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucd08\uc74c\ud30c \uc6b0\uc120 \ubc29\uc0ac\uc120 \ubcf4\uc874 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 (i) \ud070 \ube44\ud45c\uae30 \ub808\uc9c0\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9ac(37,186 \ucd08\uc74c\ud30c;

We introduce personalized LLM Federated Learning and Context-based Social Media models. In our framework, multiple client entities receive a foundational GPT model, which is fine-tuned using locally collected social media data while ensuring data privacy through federated aggregation. Key modules focus on categorizing user-generated content, computing user persona scores, and identifying relevant posts from friends networks. By integrating a sophisticated social engagement quantification method with matrix factorization techniques, our system delivers real-time personalized content suggestions tailored to individual preferences. Furthermore, an adaptive feedback loop, alongside a robust readability scoring algorithm, significantly enhances the quality and relevance of the content presented to users. This comprehensive solution not only addresses the challenges of content filtering and recommendation but also fosters a more engaging social media experience while safeguarding user privacy, setting a new standard for personalized interactions in digital platforms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc18c\uc15c

This need arises from the high sampling rate of EEG data and the long recording durations required to capture extended neurological patterns in brain activity. Transformer-based models have shown promise in modeling short sequences of a few seconds; however, their quadratic complexity limits scalability to longer contexts. Moreover, variability in electrode montage across available datasets, along with inter-subject differences in brain signals, pose significant challenges to developing a generalizable and robust foundation model. We propose \\textit{SAMBA}, a self-supervised learning framework with a Mamba-based U-shaped encoder-decoder architecture, which effectively captures long-range temporal dependencies and spatial variability in EEG data. Leveraging the inherent ability of Mamba in processing long context sizes, we introduce: (1) \\textit{Temporal Semantic Random Masking} for semantic-level sequence reconstruction, (2) a \\textit{Multi-Head Differential Mamba} module to suppress redundancy and emphasize salient temporal structures, and (3) a \\textit{Spatial-Adaptive Input Embedding} that learns unified embeddings in a three-dimensional Euclidean space, enabling robustness across devices. Experiments on thirteen EEG datasets across diverse tasks, electrode configurations, and sequence durations demonstrate that SAMBA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods while maintaining low memory consumption and inference time. We also show the learned spatial weight maps from our embedding module align closely with task-relevant neurophysiological regions, demonstrating the learnability and interpretability of SAMBA. These results highlight SAMBA's scalability and practical potential as a foundation model for real-time brain-computer interface applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "SAMBA\ub294 \uc7a5\uae30 EEG

Barria"], "title": "Bayesian-based Online Label Shift Estimation with Dynamic Dirichlet Priors", "comment": "13 pages, submitted to IEEE journal for possible publication", "summary": "Label shift, a prevalent challenge in supervised learning, arises when the class prior distribution of test data differs from that of training data, leading to significant degradation in classifier performance. To accurately estimate the test priors and enhance classification accuracy, we propose a Bayesian framework for label shift estimation, termed Full Maximum A Posterior Label Shift (FMAPLS), along with its online version, online-FMAPLS. Leveraging batch and online Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithms, these methods jointly and dynamically optimize Dirichlet hyperparameters $\\boldsymbol\u03b1$ and class priors $\\boldsymbol\u03c0$, thereby overcoming the rigid constraints of the existing Maximum A Posterior Label Shift (MAPLS) approach. Moreover, we introduce a linear surrogate function (LSF) to replace gradient-based hyperparameter updates, yielding closed-form solutions that reduce computational complexity while retaining asymptotic equivalence. The online variant substitutes the batch E-step with a stochastic approximation, enabling real-time adaptation to streaming data. Furthermore, our theoretical analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off between online convergence rate and estimation accuracy. Extensive experiments on CIFAR100 and ImageNet datasets under shuffled long-tail and Dirichlet test priors demonstrate that FMAPLS and online-FMAPLS respectively achieve up to 40% and 12% lower KL divergence and substantial improvements in post-shift accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines, particularly under severe class imbalance and distributional uncertainty.

In recent years, data-driven deep learning-based ocean forecast models, such as XiHe, WenHai, LangYa and AI-GOMS, have demonstrated significant potential in capturing complex ocean dynamics and improving forecasting efficiency. Despite these advancements, the absence of open-source, standardized benchmarks has led to inconsistent data usage and evaluation methods. This gap hinders efficient model development, impedes fair performance comparison, and constrains interdisciplinary collaboration. To address this challenge, we propose OceanForecastBench, a benchmark offering three core contributions: (1) A high-quality global ocean reanalysis data over 28 years for model training, including 4 ocean variables across 23 depth levels and 4 sea surface variables. (2) A high-reliability satellite and in-situ observations for model evaluation, covering approximately 100 million locations in the global ocean.

Our contribution is an efficient refitting procedure that computes the excess risk and provides high-probability upper bounds under the fixed-design setting. Assuming only black-box access to the training algorithm and a single dataset, we begin by generating two sets of artificially modified pseudo-outcomes termed wild response, created by stochastically perturbing the gradient vectors with carefully chosen scaling. Using these two pseudo-labeled datasets, we then refit the black-box procedure twice to obtain two corresponding wild predictors. Finally, leveraging the original predictor, the two wild predictors, and the constructed wild responses, we derive an efficient excess risk upper bound. A key feature of our analysis is that it requires no prior knowledge of the complexity of the underlying function class. As a result, the method is essentially model-free and holds significant promise for theoretically evaluating modern opaque machine learning system--such as deep nerral networks and generative model--where traditional capacity-based learning theory becomes infeasible due to the extreme complexity of the hypothesis class.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18 \ubcfc\ub85d

We propose a dual input neural network strategy that separates event and sequence attributes, using a duration-aware pseudo-embedding matrix to transform temporal importance into compact, learnable representations. This design is implemented across two baseline families: B-LSTM and B-GCN, and their duration-aware variants D-LSTM and D-GCN.

While recent advances in LLM-based code generation show promise for complex optimization, existing methods struggle with the vast optimization space due to insufficient hardware domain knowledge, failing to effectively balance exploration and exploitation. We present KernelBand, a novel framework that formulates kernel optimization as a hierarchical multi-armed bandit problem, enabling LLM agents to strategically navigate the optimization space by treating kernel selection and optimization strategy application as sequential decision-making processes. Our approach leverages hardware profiling information to identify promising optimization strategies and employs runtime behavior clustering to reduce exploration overhead across kernel candidates.

However, they suffer from a critical \\emph{gradient vanishing} problem when all responses within a group receive identical rewards, causing advantage estimates to collapse and training signals to diminish. Existing attempts to mitigate this issue fall into two paradigms: filtering-based and sampling-based methods. Filtering-based methods first generate rollouts broadly and then retroactively filter out uninformative groups, leading to substantial computational overhead. Sampling-based methods proactively select effective samples before rollout but rely on static criteria or prior dataset knowledge, lacking real-time adaptability. To address these issues, we propose \\textbf{VADE}, a \\textbf{V}ariance-\\textbf{A}ware \\textbf{D}ynamic sampling framework via online sample-level difficulty \\textbf{E}stimation. Our framework integrates three key components: online sample-level difficulty estimation using Beta distributions, a Thompson sampler that maximizes information gain through the estimated correctness probability, and a two-scale prior decay mechanism that maintains robust estimation under policy evolution. This three components design enables VADE to dynamically select the most informative samples, thereby amplifying training signals while eliminating extra rollout costs. Extensive experiments on multimodal reasoning benchmarks show that VADE consistently outperforms strong baselines in both performance and sample efficiency, while achieving a dramatic reduction in computational overhead. More importantly, our framework can serves as a plug-and-play component to be seamlessly integrated into existing group-based RL algorithms.

A natural approach to better leverage high-quality data is curriculum-based pretraining, where the model is trained on data sorted in ascending order of quality as determined by a quality metric. However, prior studies have reported limited improvements from such curriculum-based pretraining strategies. This work identifies a critical factor constraining these methods: the incompatibility between the ascending data quality order and the decaying learning rate (LR) schedule. We find that while curriculum-based training substantially outperforms random shuffling when using a constant LR, its advantage diminishes under standard LR decay schedules. Our experiments show this incompatibility can be mitigated by two simple strategies: (1) employing a more moderate LR decay schedule, where the final LR is only moderately smaller than the peak LR, and (2) replacing LR decay with model averaging, i.e., computing a weighted average of the final few checkpoints. By combining these strategies, we improve the average score on a suite of standard benchmarks by 1.64% over random shuffling, without additional data refinement. Validated on 1.5B-parameter models trained over 30B tokens with various data-quality metrics, our findings call for a re-evaluation of curriculum-based LLM pretraining and underscore the potential of co-designing data curricula with optimization methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd80\uc871\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 LLM\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud488\uc9c8

To address this challenge, we propose to compress graphs into compact representations that preserve both topological structure and robustness profile, enabling efficient and reliable evaluation.We propose Cutter, a dual-agent reinforcement learning framework composed of a Vital Detection Agent (VDA) and a Redundancy Detection Agent (RDA), which collaboratively identify structurally vital and redundant nodes for guided compression. Cutter incorporates three key strategies to enhance learning efficiency and compression quality: trajectory-level reward shaping to transform sparse trajectory returns into dense, policy-equivalent learning signals; prototype-based shaping to guide decisions using behavioral patterns from both highand low-return trajectories; and cross-agent imitation to enable safer and more transferable exploration. Experiments on multiple real-world graphs demonstrate that Cutter generates compressed graphs that retain essential static topological properties and exhibit robustness degradation trends highly consistent with the original graphs under various attack scenarios, thereby significantly improving evaluation efficiency without compromising assessment fidelity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc758 \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801 \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c, Cutter\ub77c\ub294 \uc774\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uad6c\uc870 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ud06c\uae30\uac00 \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc544\ub798\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ud06c\uace0 \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub835\ub2e4\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "Cutter\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub178\ub4dc\uc640 \uc911\ubcf5 \ub178\ub4dc\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uc5ec \uc555\ucd95\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\ub294 Vital Detection Agent (VDA)\uc640 Redundancy Detection Agent (RDA)\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \uc774\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc5ec\ub7ec \uc2e4\uc81c \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, Cutter\ub294 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc778 \uc815\uc801 \uc704\uc0c1 \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uacf5\uaca9 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6d0\ubcf8 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc640 \ub192\uc740 \uc77c\uce58\ub97c \ubcf4\uc774\ub294 \uac15\uac74\uc131 \uc800\ud558 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\ub294 \uc555\ucd95 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ud3c9\uac00 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba74\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00\uc758 \uc815\ubc00\ub3c4\ub97c \uc190\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub3c4\ub85d \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uad6c\uc870 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ucee4\uc9d0\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4e4\uace0 \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub835\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc704\uc0c1 \uad6c\uc870\uc640 \uac15\uac74\uc131 \ud504\ub85c\ud544\uc744 \ubaa8\ub450 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ucef4\ud329\ud2b8\ud55c \ud45c\ud604\uc73c\ub85c \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \uc555\ucd95\ud558\uc5ec \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Vital Detection Agent(VDA)\uc640 Redundancy Detection Agent(RDA)\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \uc774\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c Cutter\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub178\ub4dc\uc640 \uc911\ubcf5 \ub178\ub4dc\ub97c \uacf5\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uc5ec \uc555\ucd95\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, existing VLA models, often built upon Vision-Language Models (VLMs), typically process dense visual inputs independently at each timestep. This approach implicitly models the task as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). However, this history-agnostic design is suboptimal for effective visual token processing in dynamic sequential decision-making, as it fails to leverage the context of history. To address this limitation, we reformulate the problem from a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) perspective and propose a novel framework named AVA-VLA. Inspired by the POMDP that the action generation should be conditioned on the belief state. AVA-VLA introduces Active Visual Attention (AVA) to dynamically modulate visual processing. It achieves this by leveraging the recurrent state, which is a neural approximation of the agent's belief state derived from the previous decision step.

However, existing approaches predominantly rely on external human-annotated preference data, which is costly and labor-intensive to collect. In this work, we propose OrdMoE, a novel preference alignment framework that bypasses the reliance on external human preferences entirely by leveraging intrinsic signals within Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. Specifically, we observe that the router's expert selection scores implicitly encode a quality-aware ranking of responses (i.e. higher-scoring experts consistently generate higher-quality outputs). Building on this insight, OrdMoE constructs an internal preference hierarchy by grouping experts into ranked tiers based on their per-token routing scores and activating each tier separately to produce a sequence of responses with increasing quality. This yields a zero-cost, self-supervised preference ordering over generated responses, which can be directly optimized using standard preference learning objectives. Extensive experiments across multiple multimodal benchmarks demnstrate that OrdMoE significantly enhances both alignment and overall performance of multimodal Mixture-of-Experts LLMs, achieving competitive results without requiring any human-annotated preference data.", "AI": {"tldr": "OrdMoE\ub294 \uc678\ubd80 \uc778\uac04 \uc120\ud638 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0, Mixture-of-Experts \uad6c\uc870 \ub0b4\ubd80\uc758 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc120\ud638 \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud6c4\uc18d \uad50\uc721 \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc804\ub7b5\uc73c\ub85c\uc11c\uc758 \uc120\ud638 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131.", "method": "OrdMoE\ub294 router\uc758 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc120\ud0dd \uc810\uc218\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc751\ub2f5\uc758 \ud488\uc9c8 \uc778\uc2dd \uc21c\uc704\ub97c \uc554\ubb35\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \ub0b4\uc7ac\uc801\uc778 \uc120\ud638 \uc704\uacc4\ub97c \uad6c\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "OrdMoE\ub294 \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \uc751\ub2f5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc81c\ub85c \ube44\uc6a9\uc758 \uc790\uac00 \uac10\ub3c5 \uc120\ud638 \uc21c\uc11c\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ud45c\uc900 \uc120\ud638 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 OrdMoE\uac00 \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec Mixture-of-Experts LLM\uc758 \uc815\ub82c \ubc0f \uc804\uccb4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc120\ud638 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \ucd5c\uadfc \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(MLLM)\uc758 \ud6c4\uc18d \ud6c8\ub828 \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc804\ub7b5\uc73c\ub85c \ubd80\uc0c1\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc8fc\ub85c \uc678\ubd80 \uc778\uac04 \uc8fc\uc11d \uc120\ud638 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294\ub370, \uc774\ub294 \uc218\uc9d1\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4e4\uace0 \ub178\ub3d9 \uc9d1\uc57d\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 MoE(Mixture-of-Experts) \uad6c\uc870 \ub0b4\uc758 \ub0b4\uc7ac\uc801 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc678\ubd80 \uc778\uac04 \uc120\ud638 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \uc644\uc804\ud788 \uc6b0\ud68c\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc120\ud638 \uc815\ub82c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 OrdMoE\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub77c\uc6b0\ud130\uc758 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc120\ud0dd \uc810\uc218\uac00 \uc554\ubb35\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc751\ub2f5\uc758 \ud488\uc9c8 \uc778\uc2dd \uc21c\uc704\ub97c \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uad00\ucc30\ud558\uc600\ub2e4(\uc989, \ub192\uc740 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \ubc1b\uc740 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uac00 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ub192\uc740 \ud488\uc9c8\uc758 \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4). \uc774 \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c, OrdMoE\ub294 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\ub97c \uac01 \ud1a0\ud070 \ub77c\uc6b0\ud305 \uc810\uc218\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc21c\uc704\uac00 \ub9e4\uaca8\uc9c4 \uacc4\uce35\uc73c\ub85c \uadf8\ub8f9\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \ub0b4\ubd80 \uc120\ud638 \uc704\uacc4\ub97c \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uac01 \uacc4\uce35\uc744 \ubcc4\ub3c4\ub85c \ud65c\uc131\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \ud488\uc9c8\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uc751\ub2f5 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \uc751\ub2f5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc81c\ub85c \ube44\uc6a9, \uc790\uac00 \uac10\ub3c5 \uc120\ud638 \uc21c\uc11c\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ud45c\uc900 \uc120\ud638 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc9c1\uc811 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 OrdMoE\uac00 \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec Mixture-of-Experts LLM\uc758 \uc815\ub82c \ubc0f \uc804\uccb4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0, \uc778\uac04 \uc8fc\uc11d \uc120\ud638 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4."}}

Preliminary version; extended experiments and analysis forthcoming", "summary": "Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) faces two major design bottlenecks: crafting dense reward functions and constructing curricula that avoid local optima in high-dimensional, non-stationary environments. Existing approaches rely on fixed heuristics or use Large Language Models (LLMs) directly in the control loop, which is costly and unsuitable for real-time systems. We propose MAESTRO (Multi-Agent Environment Shaping through Task and Reward Optimization), a framework that moves the LLM outside the execution loop and uses it as an offline training architect. MAESTRO introduces two generative components: (i) a semantic curriculum generator that creates diverse, performance-driven traffic scenarios, and (ii) an automated reward synthesizer that produces executable Python reward functions adapted to evolving curriculum difficulty. These components guide a standard MARL backbone (MADDPG) without increasing inference cost at deployment. We evaluate MAESTRO on large-scale traffic signal control (Hangzhou, 16 intersections) and conduct controlled ablations. Results show that combining LLM-generated curricula with LLM-generated reward shaping yields improved performance and stability.

Using weekly sales data from 45 Walmart stores, we construct a relational forecasting framework that models inter-store dependencies through a learned adaptive graph. The proposed STGNN predicts log-differenced sales and reconstructs final values through a residual path, enabling stable training and improved generalisation. Experiments show that STGNN achieves the lowest overall forecasting error, outperforming all baselines in Normalised Total Absolute Error, P90 MAPE, and variance of MAPE across stores. Analysis of the learned adjacency matrix reveals meaningful functional store clusters and high-influence nodes that emerge without geographic metadata.

Previous work and recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential for automating the generation of reward functions. However, existing methodologies often require preliminary evaluation metrics, human-engineered feedback for the refinement process, or the use of environmental source code as context. To address these limitations, this paper introduces LEARN-Opt (LLM-based Evaluator and Analyzer for Reward functioN Optimization). This LLM-based, fully autonomous, and model-agnostic framework eliminates the need for preliminary metrics and environmental source code as context to generate, execute, and evaluate reward function candidates from textual descriptions of systems and task objectives. LEARN-Opt's main contribution lies in its ability to autonomously derive performance metrics directly from the system description and the task objective, enabling unsupervised evaluation and selection of reward functions. Our experiments indicate that LEARN-Opt achieves performance comparable to or better to that of state-of-the-art methods, such as EUREKA, while requiring less prior knowledge. We find that automated reward design is a high-variance problem, where the average-case candidate fails, requiring a multi-run approach to find the best candidates. Finally, we show that LEARN-Opt can unlock the potential of low-cost LLMs to find high-performing candidates that are comparable to, or even better than, those of larger models. This demonstrated performance affirms its potential to generate high-quality reward functions without requiring any preliminary human-defined metrics, thereby reducing engineering overhead and enhancing generalizability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 LEARN-Opt\ub77c\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc790\uc728\uc801 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0, \uad00\ub9ac\uc790 \uc815\uc758 \uc9c0\ud45c \uc5c6\uc774 \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218 \ub514\uc790\uc778\uc758 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \ubc29\ub300\ud55c \uc778\uac04 \uc804\ubb38 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uacfc \uc2dc\uac04 \uc18c\ubaa8\ub97c \uc694\uad6c\ud558\uc5ec \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "LEARN-Opt\ub294 \ud658\uacbd \uc18c\uc2a4 \ucf54\ub4dc\ub098 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud3c9\uac00 \uc9c0\ud45c \uc5c6\uc774 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ubc0f \uc791\uc5c5 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc758 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc124\uba85\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218 \ud6c4\ubcf4\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131, \uc2e4\ud589 \ubc0f \ud3c9\uac00\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc644\uc804 \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uad6c\uc560\ubc1b\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "result": "LEARN-Opt\ub294 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ucd5c\uc2e0 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec \ub3d9\ub4f1\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uc774\uc804 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc774 \ub35c \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "LEARN-Opt\ub294 \uace0\uc131\ub2a5 \ud6c4\ubcf4\ub97c \ucc3e\uc544\ub0bc \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc800\ube44\uc6a9 LLM\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uc5f4\uc5b4\uc8fc\uba70, \uc0ac\uc804 \uc815\uc758\ub41c \uc778\uac04 \uc9c0\ud45c \uc5c6\uc774 \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ub4b7\ubc1b\uce68\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \uc124\uacc4\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\uba70, \uc885\uc885 \ubc29\ub300\ud55c \uc778\uac04 \uc804\ubb38 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uacfc \uc2dc\uac04 \uc18c\ubaa8\ub97c \uc694\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\uc804 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc640 \ucd5c\uadfc \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud560 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud3c9\uac00 \uc9c0\ud45c, \uc815\uc81c \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc778\uac04 \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\ub9c1 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31, \ub610\ub294 \ubb38\ub9e5\uc73c\ub85c \ud658\uacbd \uc18c\uc2a4 \ucf54\ub4dc\ub97c \uc694\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 LEARN-Opt(LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud3c9\uac00\uc790 \ubc0f \ubd84\uc11d\uae30)\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 LLM \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc644\uc804 \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ubaa8\ub378 \ubb34\uad00\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218 \ud6c4\ubcf4\ub97c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ubc0f \uc791\uc5c5 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc758 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc124\uba85\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc0dd\uc131, \uc2e4\ud589 \ubc0f \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc0ac\uc804 \uc9c0\ud45c\uc640 \ud658\uacbd \uc18c\uc2a4 \ucf54\ub4dc\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uc5c6\uc564\ub2e4.

While MARL enables decentralized deployment on resource-constrained edge devices, it suffers from severe non-stationarity due to the synchronous updates of agent policies. This non stationarity results in unstable training and poor policy con vergence, especially as the number of agents increases. In this paper, we propose RELED, a scalable MARL framework that integrates large language model (LLM)-driven expert demonstrations with autonomous agent exploration. RELED incorporates a Stationarity-Aware Expert Demonstration module, which leverages theoretical non-stationarity bounds to enhance the quality of LLM-generated expert trajectories, thus providing high reward and training-stable samples for each agent. Moreover, a Hybrid Expert-Agent Policy Optimization module adaptively balances each agent's learning from both expert-generated and agent-generated trajectories, accelerating policy convergence and improving generalization. Extensive experiments with real city networks based on OpenStreetMap demonstrate that RELED achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art MARL methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uba40\ud2f0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(MARL)\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub7ec\ube14 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 RELED\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "MARL\uc740 \uc790\uc6d0\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc5e3\uc9c0 \uc7a5\uce58\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubd84\uc0b0 \ubc30\ud3ec\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub3d9\uae30 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc131\uc744 \uacaa\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "RELED\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc2dc\uc5f0\uacfc \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\ub85c \uc124\uacc4\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "RELED\ub294 OpenStreetMap\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uc2e4\uc81c \ub3c4\uc2dc \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc2e0 MARL \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 RELED\uac00 \uc815\ucc45 \uc218\ub834\uc744 \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uba40\ud2f0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(MARL)\uc740 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc774 \ucc44\ud0dd\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

These multi-agent interactions pose a fundamental challenge, particularly in social dilemmas, where agents' individual incentives can undermine collective welfare. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been effective for aligning large language models (LLMs) in the single-agent regime, prior small-network results suggest that standard RL in multi-agent settings often converges to defecting, self-interested policies. We show the same effect in LLMs: despite cooperative priors, RL-trained LLM agents develop opportunistic behavior that can exploit even advanced closed-source models. To address this tendency of RL to converge to poor equilibria, we adapt a recent opponent-learning awareness algorithm, Advantage Alignment, to fine-tune LLMs toward multi-agent cooperation and non-exploitability. We then introduce a group-relative baseline that simplifies advantage computation in iterated games, enabling multi-agent training at LLM scale. We also contribute a novel social dilemma environment, Trust and Split, which requires natural language communication to achieve high collective welfare. Across a wide range of social dilemmas, policies learned with Advantage Alignment achieve higher collective payoffs while remaining robust against exploitation by greedy agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \ub51c\ub808\ub9c8\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 AI\uc758 \ud655\uc0b0\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \ubaa9\ud45c\uac00 \ub2e4\ub974\uac70\ub098 \uc0c1\ucda9\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc774 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud558\uac8c \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ucd5c\uadfc\uc758 \ub300\uc870 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc778\uc2dd \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc778 Advantage Alignment\ub97c \uc801\uc751\uc2dc\ucf1c LLM\uc744 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud611\ub825\uacfc \ube44\ucc29\ucde8\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "Advantage Alignment\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \uc815\ucc45\uc774 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \ub51c\ub808\ub9c8\uc5d0\uc11c \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \uc9d1\ud569\uc801 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ud0d0\uc695\uc801\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ucc29\ucde8\uc5d0 \uc798 \uc800\ud56d\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Trust and Split\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \ub51c\ub808\ub9c8 \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc774 \ub192\uc740 \uc9d1\ub2e8 \ubcf5\uc9c0\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc694\ud568\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ub9ac\uc778 AI\uac00 \ubcf4\ud3b8\ud654\ub428\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc774 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud558\uac8c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud560 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uac1c\uc778\uc801 \uc778\uc13c\ud2f0\ube0c\uac00 \uc9d1\ub2e8 \ubcf5\uc9c0\ub97c \ud574\uce60 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \ub51c\ub808\ub9c8\uc5d0\uc11c \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uc804\uc744 \uc81c\uae30\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc774 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \uc815\ub82c\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\uc804\uc758 \uc18c\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ud45c\uc900 RL\uc774 \uc885\uc885 \uc790\uc2e0\uc744 \uc774\ub86d\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uc815\ucc45\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ub834\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 LLM\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uac19\uc740 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud611\ub825\uc801\uc778 \uc0ac\uc804 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0, RL\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc2ec\uc9c0\uc5b4 \uace0\uae09 \ube44\uacf5\uac1c \ubaa8\ub378\uc870\ucc28 \ucc29\ucde8\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uae30\ud68c\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubc1c\uc804\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, UMMs still exhibit a fundamental inconsistency: understanding favors compact embeddings, whereas generation favors reconstruction-rich representations. This structural trade-off produces misaligned decision boundaries, degraded cross-modal coherence, and heightened vulnerability under distributional and adversarial shifts. In this paper, we present UniGame, a self-adversarial post-training framework that directly targets the inconsistencies. By applying a lightweight perturber at the shared token interface, UniGame enables the generation branch to actively seek and challenge fragile understanding, turning the model itself into its own adversary. Experiments demonstrate that UniGame significantly improves the consistency (+4.6%). Moreover, it also achieves substantial improvements in understanding (+3.6%), generation (+0.02), out-of-distribution and adversarial robustness (+4.8% and +6.2% on NaturalBench and AdVQA). The framework is architecture-agnostic, introduces less than 1% additional parameters, and is complementary to existing post-training methods. These results position adversarial self-play as a general and effective principle for enhancing the coherence, stability, and unified competence of future multimodal foundation models.
