While this architecture decouples the reasoning engine from tool execution to enhance scalability, it introduces a significant privacy surface: third-party MCP servers, acting as semi-honest intermediaries, can observe detailed tool interaction logs outside the user's trusted boundary. In this paper, we first identify and formalize a novel privacy threat termed Intent Inversion, where a semi-honest MCP server attempts to reconstruct the user's private underlying intent solely by analyzing legitimate tool calls. To systematically assess this vulnerability, we propose IntentMiner, a framework that leverages Hierarchical Information Isolation and Three-Dimensional Semantic Analysis, integrating tool purpose, call statements, and returned results, to accurately infer user intent at the step level. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IntentMiner achieves a high degree of semantic alignment (over 85%) with original user queries, significantly outperforming baseline approaches. These results highlight the inherent privacy risks in decoupled agent architectures, revealing that seemingly benign tool execution logs can serve as a potent vector for exposing user secrets.", "AI":

While existing adversarial attacks primarily focus on content falsification or instruction injection, we identify a novel, process-oriented attack surface: the agent's reasoning style. We propose Reasoning-Style Poisoning (RSP), a paradigm that manipulates how agents process information rather than what they process. We introduce Generative Style Injection (GSI), an attack method that rewrites retrieved documents into pathological tones--specifically \"analysis paralysis\" or \"cognitive haste\"--without altering underlying facts or using explicit triggers. To quantify these shifts, we develop the Reasoning Style Vector (RSV), a metric tracking Verification depth, Self-confidence, and Attention focus. Experiments on HotpotQA and FEVER using ReAct, Reflection, and Tree of Thoughts (ToT) architectures reveal that GSI significantly degrades performance. It increases reasoning steps by up to 4.4 times or induces premature errors, successfully bypassing state-of-the-art content filters. Finally, we propose RSP-M, a lightweight runtime monitor that calculates RSV metrics in real-time and triggers alerts when values exceed safety thresholds. Our work demonstrates that reasoning style is a distinct, exploitable vulnerability, necessitating process-level defenses beyond static content analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacf5\uaca9 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc815\ubcf4 \ucc98\ub9ac \ubc29\uc2dd\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc8fc\ub294 Reasoning-Style Poisoning(RSP)\uacfc Generative Style Injection(GSI) \uacf5\uaca9 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc5ec \uc131\ub2a5 \uc800\ud558\ub97c \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubaa8\ub4e0 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacf5\uaca9 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc778 Reasoning-Style Poisoning\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "Generative Style Injection(GSI) \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac80\uc0c9\ub41c \ubb38\uc11c\ub97c \uc65c\uace1\ub41c \ud1a4\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\uc815\ud558\uace0, Reasoning Style Vector(RSV) \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774 \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "GSI \uacf5\uaca9\uc774 ReAct, Reflection, Tree of Thoughts(ToT) \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uacc4\uc801 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ucd5c\ub300 4.4\ubc30 \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ud0a4\uac70\ub098 \uc870\uae30 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \uc720\ubc1c\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \ub0b4\uc6a9 \ud544\ud130\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b0\ud68c\ud568\uc744 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ucd94\ub860 \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c\uc740 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc545\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc774\uba70, \uc815\uc801 \ucf58\ud150\uce20 \ubd84\uc11d \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uacfc\uc815 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\uc5b4\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud568\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc678\ubd80 \uac80\uc0c9\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc911\uc694 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ubc30\uce58\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9\uc740 \uc8fc\ub85c \ucf58\ud150\uce20 \ud5c8\uc704 \ub610\ub294 \uba85\ub839 \uc8fc\uc785\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacfc\uc815 \uc9c0\ud5a5\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9 \ud45c\uba74\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uc815\ubcf4 \ucc98\ub9ac \ub0b4\uc6a9\uc744 \uc870\uc791\ud558\ub294 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc778 Reasoning-Style Poisoning(RSP)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

This complexity generates overwhelming volumes of operational data, leading to critical bottlenecks in conventional systems: inefficient information processing, poor task coordination, and loss of contextual continuity during fault diagnosis and remediation. To address these challenges, we propose AOI (AI-Oriented Operations), a novel multi-agent collaborative framework that integrates three specialized agents with an LLM-based Context Compressor. Its core innovations include: (1) a dynamic task scheduling strategy that adaptively prioritizes operations based on real-time system states, and (2) a three-layer memory architecture comprising Working, Episodic, and Semantic layers that optimizes context retention and retrieval. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that AOI effectively mitigates information overload, achieving a 72.4% context compression ratio while preserving 92.8% of critical information and significantly enhances operational efficiency, attaining a 94.2% task success rate and reducing the Mean Time to Repair (MTTR) by 34.4% compared to the best baseline. This work presents a paradigm shift towards scalable, adaptive, and context-aware autonomous operations, enabling robust management of next-generation IT infrastructures with minimal human intervention.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc \ub124\uc774\ud2f0\ube0c \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c

We present a secure, modular framework for automated structured feature extraction from clinical notes leveraging locally deployed large language models (LLMs) on institutionally approved, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA)-compliant compute infrastructure. This system integrates retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and structured response methods of LLMs into a widely deployable and scalable container to provide feature extraction for diverse clinical domains. In evaluation, the framework achieved high accuracy across multiple medical characteristics present in large bodies of patient notes when compared against an expert-annotated dataset and identified several annotation errors missed in manual review.

Acquiring such high-resolution wind data, however, remains a challenging and expensive endeavour. Traditional reconstruction approaches are typically either cost-effective or accurate, but not both. Deep learning methods, including diffusion models, have been proposed to resolve this trade-off by leveraging advances in natural image super-resolution. Wind data, however, is distinct from natural images, and wind super-resolvers often use upwards of 10 input channels, significantly more than the usual 3-channel RGB inputs in natural images. To better leverage a large number of conditioning variables in diffusion models, we present a generalization of classifier-free guidance (CFG) to multiple conditioning inputs. Our novel composite classifier-free guidance (CCFG) can be dropped into any pre-trained diffusion model trained with standard CFG dropout. We demonstrate that CCFG outputs are higher-fidelity than those from CFG on wind super-resolution tasks. We present WindDM, a diffusion model trained for industrial-scale wind dynamics reconstruction and leveraging CCFG. WindDM achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality among deep learning models and costs up to $1000\\times$ less than classical methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740

We introduce a Multi-Agent Medical Decision Consensus Matrix System that deploys seven specialized large language model agents, including an oncologist, a radiologist, a nurse, a psychologist, a patient advocate, a nutritionist and a rehabilitation therapist, to simulate realistic MDT workflows. The framework incorporates a mathematically grounded consensus matrix that uses Kendall's coefficient of concordance to objectively assess agreement. To further enhance treatment recommendation quality and consensus efficiency, the system integrates reinforcement learning methods, including Q-Learning, PPO and DQN. Evaluation across five medical benchmarks (MedQA, PubMedQA, DDXPlus, MedBullets and SymCat) shows substantial gains over existing approaches, achieving an average accuracy of 87.5% compared with 83.8% for the strongest baseline, a consensus achievement rate of 89.3% and a mean Kendall's W of 0.823. Expert reviewers rated the clinical appropriateness of system outputs at 8.9/10. The system guarantees full evidence traceability through mandatory citations of clinical guidelines and peer-reviewed literature, following GRADE principles.

In high-stakes industrial applications, noisy labels can degrade performance and erode user trust. This paper presents Adjudicator, a system that addresses the critical data mining challenge of automatically identifying and correcting label noise and has been validated for production deployment. Adjudicator models this as a neuro-symbolic task, first constructing a dynamic Knowledge Graph (KG) to unify item context. This KG then informs a \"Council of Agents,\" a novel multi-agent Large Language Model architecture where specialized agents debate and vote on a label's validity. We validate our system on a 1,000-item balanced subset of the AlleNoise benchmark. Our KG-informed model achieves a 0.99 F1-score, significantly outperforming a single-LLM baseline (0.48 F1) and a non-KG council (0.59 F1). Our analysis reveals this is due to a Precision, achieved by a novel override logic that uses the KG to perfectly identify complex, structural errors (complete Recall) -- a class of errors that baselines fail to find. This result demonstrates a robust and explainable system for automated, high-precision data verification, serving as a vital proof-of-concept for generating golden datasets in strictly governed industrial environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub808\uc774\ube14 \ub178\uc774\uc988\ub97c \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0 \uc218\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc778 Adjudicator\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc0dd\uc0b0 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uac80\uc99d\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc0dd\uc0b0 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc740 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ud488\uc9c8\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc81c\ud55c\ub418\uba70, \uc0b0\uc5c5 \uc751\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c \ub178\uc774\uc988\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \ub808\uc774\ube14\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc800\ud558\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "Adjudicator\ub294 \uc774\ub97c \uc2e0\uacbd-\uae30\ud638\uc801 \uacfc\uc81c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uba70, \uc544\uc774\ud15c \ub9e5\ub77d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uadf8\ub798\ud504(KG)\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uace0, \uc5ec\uae30\uc11c KM-informed \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 '\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc704\uc6d0\ud68c'\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub808\uc774\ube14\uc758 \uc720\ud6a8\uc131\uc744 \ud1a0\ub860\ud558\uace0 \ud22c\ud45c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "Adjudicator\ub294 AlleNoise \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc758 1,000\uac1c \ud56d\ubaa9 \uade0\ud615 \uc11c\ube0c\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c 0.99 F1 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \uae30\ub85d\ud558\uba70, \ub2e8\uc77c LLM \uae30\uc900\uc758 0.48 F1 \ubc0f \ube44-KG \uc704\uc6d0\ud68c\uc758 0.59 F1\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud6e8\uc52c \ub192\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uace0\uc815\ubc00 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud558\uace0 \uc124\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \uaddc\uc81c\ub97c \ubc1b\ub294 \uc0b0\uc5c5 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uace8\ub4dc \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uac1c\ub150 \uc99d\uba85\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc0dd\uc0b0 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc740 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ud488\uc9c8\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c\ub2e4. \uace0\uc704\ud5d8 \uc0b0\uc5c5 \uc751\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c \ub178\uc774\uc988\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \ub808\uc774\ube14\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc800\ud558\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub97c \uce68\uc2dd\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub808\uc774\ube14 \ub178\uc774\uc988\ub97c \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0 \uc218\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ub9c8\uc774\ub2dd \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8e8\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc778 Adjudicator\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc0dd\uc0b0 \ubc30\ud3ec\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uac80\uc99d\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.

Depth Up-Scaling (DUS) has emerged as a promising strategy by duplicating layers and applying Continual Pre-training (CPT), but its reliance on feed-forward networks (FFNs) limits efficiency and attainable gains. We introduce Memory-Infused Depth Up-Scaling (MIDUS), which replaces FFNs in duplicated blocks with a head-wise memory (HML) layer. Motivated by observations that attention heads have distinct roles both across and within layers, MIDUS assigns an independent memory bank to each head, enabling head-wise retrieval and injecting information into subsequent layers while preserving head-wise functional structure. This design combines sparse memory access with head-wise representations and incorporates an efficient per-head value factorization module, thereby relaxing the usual efficiency-performance trade-off. Across our CPT experiments, MIDUS exhibits robust performance improvements over strong DUS baselines while maintaining a highly efficient parameter footprint.

However, existing methods often fail to fully exploit the complementary information across views, leading to suboptimal feature representations and limited performance. To address this, we propose MV-SupGCN, a semi-supervised GCN model that integrates several complementary components with clear motivations and mutual reinforcement. First, to better capture discriminative features and improve model generalization, we design a joint loss function that combines Cross-Entropy loss with Supervised Contrastive loss, encouraging the model to simultaneously minimize intra-class variance and maximize inter-class separability in the latent space. Second, recognizing the instability and incompleteness of single graph construction methods, we combine both KNN-based and semi-supervised graph construction approaches on each view, thereby enhancing the robustness of the data structure representation and reducing generalization error. Third, to effectively utilize abundant unlabeled data and enhance semantic alignment across multiple views, we propose a unified framework that integrates contrastive learning in order to enforce consistency among multi-view embeddings and capture meaningful inter-view relationships, together with pseudo-labeling, which provides additional supervision applied to both the cross-entropy and contrastive loss functions to enhance model generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MV-SupGCN consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks, validating the effectiveness of our integrated approach.

Such methods discard useful variants, suffer from destructive edits, and explore a brittle search space prone to structural failure. We introduce EvoLattice, a framework that represents an entire population of candidate programs or agent behaviors within a single directed acyclic graph. Each node stores multiple persistent alternatives, and every valid path through the graph defines a distinct executable candidate, yielding a large combinatorial search space without duplicating structure. EvoLattice enables fine-grained alternative-level evaluation by scoring each alternative across all paths in which it appears, producing statistics that reveal how local design choices affect global performance. These statistics provide a dense, data-driven feedback signal for LLM-guided mutation, recombination, and pruning, while preserving successful components. Structural correctness is guaranteed by a deterministic self-repair mechanism that enforces acyclicity and dependency consistency independently of the LLM. EvoLattice naturally extends to agent evolution by interpreting alternatives as prompt fragments or sub-agent behaviors. Across program synthesis (proxy and optimizer meta-learning), EvoLattice yields more stable evolution, greater expressivity, and stronger improvement trajectories than prior LLM-guided methods. The resulting dynamics resemble quality-diversity optimization, emerging implicitly from EvoLattice's internal multi-alternative representation rather than an explicit external archive.", "AI": {"tldr": "EvoLattice\ub294 \ud558\ub098\uc758 \ubc29\ud5a5 \ube44\uc21c\ud658 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc804\uccb4 \ud6c4\ubcf4 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8 \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc744 \ud45c\ud604\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc0dd\uc131 \ubc0f \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c LLM\uc758 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \ub2e8\uc77c \ud6c4\ubcf4\ub9cc \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uc624\ubc84\ub77c\uc774\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \ubcc0\ud615\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c \ubcc0\ud615\uc744 \ud3d0\uae30\ud558\uace0 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc2e4\ud328\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud558\ub294 \ucde8\uc57d\ud55c \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "EvoLattice\ub294 \uac01 \ub178\ub4dc\uac00 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uac00\uc9c0 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ub300\uc548\uc744 \uc800\uc7a5\ud558\uace0, \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc720\ud6a8\ud55c \uacbd\ub85c\uac00 \uace0\uc720\ud55c \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud6c4\ubcf4\ub97c \uc815\uc758\ud558\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4. \uac01 \ub300\uc548\uc740 \uadf8 \ub4f1\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uacbd\ub85c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc810\uc218\ub97c \ub9e4\uae40\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc815\ubc00\ud55c \ub300\uc548 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00\uac00 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\ub2e4.", "result": "EvoLattice\ub294 \uae30\uc874 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc9c4\ud654, \ub354 \ud070 \ud45c\ud604\ub825 \ubc0f \ub354 \uac15\ud55c \uac1c\uc120 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \ud488\uc9c8-\ub2e4\uc591\uc131 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc640 \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \ub3d9\ud0dc\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "EvoLattice\ub294 LLM\uc758 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \uacb0\uc815\ub860\uc801 \uc790\uae30 \uc218\ub9ac \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc62c\ubc14\ub984\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uace0, \ub300\uc548\uc744 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc870\uac01\uc774\ub098 \ud558\uc704 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud589\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uc11d\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc9c4\ud654\uc5d0\ub3c4 \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7fd\uac8c \ud655\uc7a5\ub41c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8 \ubc0f \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc5d0 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc774 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ud55c \ubc88\uc5d0 \ub2e8\uc77c \ud6c4\ubcf4\ub9cc \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uc624\ubc84\ub77c\uc774\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \ubcc0\uc774\ub97c rely\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c \ubcc0\ud615\uc744 \ud3d0\uae30\ud558\uace0 \ud30c\uad34\uc801\uc778 \uc218\uc815\uc744 \uacaa\uc73c\uba70 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc2e4\ud328\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud55c brittle search space\ub97c \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 EvoLattice\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\ub294\ub370, \uc774\ub294 \ub2e8\uc77c \ubc29\ud5a5 \ube44\uc21c\ud658 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6c4\ubcf4 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8 \ub610\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud589\ub3d9\uc758 \uc804\uccb4 \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc744 \ud45c\ud604\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4. \uac01 \ub178\ub4dc\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ub300\uc548\uc744 \uc800\uc7a5\ud558\uba70, \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc720\ud6a8\ud55c \uacbd\ub85c\ub294 \uace0\uc720\ud55c \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud6c4\ubcf4\ub97c \uc815\uc758\ud558\uc5ec \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uc911\ubcf5\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0\ub3c4 \ud070 \uc870\ud569 \uac80\uc0c9 \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.

The Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture, with its RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) modules, has emerged as a pivotal solution for dynamic resource management and network slicing. While artificial intelligence (AI) driven methods have shown promise, most approaches struggle to maintain performance under unpredictable and highly dynamic conditions. This paper proposes an adaptive Meta Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (Meta-HRL) framework, inspired by Model Agnostic Meta Learning (MAML), to jointly optimize resource allocation and network slicing in O-RAN. The framework integrates hierarchical control with meta learning to enable both global and local adaptation: the high-level controller allocates resources across slices, while low level agents perform intra slice scheduling. The adaptive meta-update mechanism weights tasks by temporal difference error variance, improving stability and prioritizing complex network scenarios. Theoretical analysis establishes sublinear convergence and regret guarantees for the two-level learning process. Simulation results demonstrate a 19.8% improvement in network management efficiency compared with baseline RL and meta-RL approaches, along with faster adaptation and higher QoS satisfaction across eMBB, URLLC, and mMTC slices.

However, compared to the more widely studied MHC-I in computational immunotherapy, the study of MHC-II antigenic epitope poses significantly more challenges due to its complex binding specificity and ambiguous motif patterns. Consequently, existing datasets for MHC-II interactions are smaller and less standardized than those available for MHC-I. To address these challenges, we present a well-curated dataset derived from the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) and other public sources. It not only extends and standardizes existing peptide-MHC-II datasets, but also introduces a novel antigen-MHC-II dataset with richer biological context. Leveraging this dataset, we formulate three major machine learning (ML) tasks of peptide binding, peptide presentation, and antigen presentation, which progressively capture the broader biological processes within the MHC-II antigen presentation pathway. We further employ a multi-scale evaluation framework to benchmark existing models, along with a comprehensive analysis over various modeling designs to this problem with a modular framework.

Several prior approaches have relied on LLM-based free-form search over the code space. In this work, we propose a more structured framework that explores the same space through a fixed set of simple, composable components. We show that, despite lacking the generative flexibility of LLMs during the candidate generation stage, our method outperforms prior approaches on four out of five benchmarks across two domains: mathematics and question answering. Furthermore, our method offers additional advantages, including a more cost-efficient search process and the generation of modular, interpretable multi-agent systems with simpler logic.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc790\uc720\ud615 \uac80\uc0c9 \ub300\uc2e0, \uac04\ub2e8\ud558\uace0 \uc870\ud569 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc790\ub3d9 \uac80\uc0c9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc790\ub3d9 \uac80\uc0c9\uc774 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud575\uc2ec \ucd08\uc810\uc73c\ub85c \ub5a0\uc624\ub974\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \uc870\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uace0\uc815\ub41c \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ud6c4\ubcf4 \uc0dd\uc131 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c LLM\uc758 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc720\uc5f0\uc131\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud568\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778(\uc218\ud559 \ubc0f \uc9c8\ubb38 \uc751\ub2f5)\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc12f \uac1c\uc758 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \uc911 \ub124 \uac1c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\uc804 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \ube44\uc6a9 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uac80\uc0c9 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\uc640 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \ub17c\ub9ac\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc2dd, \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ucd94\uac00 \uc7a5\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc790\ub3d9 \uac80\uc0c9\uc740 \ucd5c\uadfc \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc8fc\uc694 \ucd08\uc810\uc73c\ub85c \ub5a0\uc62c\ub790\ub2e4. \uc774\uc804\uc758 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ucf54\ub4dc \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c LLM \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc790\uc720 \ud615\uc2dd \uac80\uc0c9\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud574\uc654\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uace0\uc815\ub41c \ub2e8\uc21c \uc870\ud569 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\ub294 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud6c4\ubcf4 \uc0dd\uc131 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c LLM\uc758 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc720\uc5f0\uc131\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud568\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc218\ud559 \ubc0f \uc9c8\ubb38 \uc751\ub2f5\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc12f \uac1c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \uc911 \ub124 \uac1c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\uc804 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\ub294 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \uac8c\ub2e4\uac00, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \ube44\uc6a9 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uac80\uc0c9 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\uc640 \ub354 \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \ub17c\ub9ac\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc2dd\uc774\uace0 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ucd94\uac00\uc801\uc778 \uc7a5\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

As AI systems expand into real-world applications, adapting to personalized values beyond task completion or collective alignment has become a critical challenge. We address this by proposing a value-driven approach to personalized decision-making. Human values serve as stable, transferable signals that support consistent and generalizable behavior across contexts. Compared to task-oriented paradigms driven by external rewards and incentives, value-driven decision-making enhances interpretability and enables agents to act appropriately even in novel scenarios. We introduce ValuePilot, a two-phase framework consisting of a dataset generation toolkit (DGT) and a decision-making module (DMM). DGT constructs diverse, value-annotated scenarios from a human-LLM collaborative pipeline. DMM learns to evaluate actions based on personal value preferences, enabling context-sensitive, individualized decisions. When evaluated on previously unseen scenarios, DMM outperforms strong LLM baselines, including GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, Gemini-2-flash, and Llama-3.1-70b, in aligning with human action choices.

Hyperbolic feature spaces are well-suited for this purpose, as they naturally capture hierarchical and relational structure often present in complex RL environments. However, leveraging these spaces commonly faces optimization challenges due to the nonstationarity of RL. In this work, we identify key factors that determine the success and failure of training hyperbolic deep RL agents. By analyzing the gradients of core operations in the Poincar\u00e9 Ball and Hyperboloid models of hyperbolic geometry, we show that large-norm embeddings destabilize gradient-based training, leading to trust-region violations in proximal policy optimization (PPO). Based on these insights, we introduce Hyper++, a new hyperbolic PPO agent that consists of three components: (i) stable critic training through a categorical value loss instead of regression; (ii) feature regularization guaranteeing bounded norms while avoiding the curse of dimensionality from clipping; and (iii) using a more optimization-friendly formulation of hyperbolic network layers. In experiments on ProcGen, we show that Hyper++ guarantees stable learning, outperforms prior hyperbolic agents, and reduces wall-clock time by approximately 30%. On Atari-5 with Double DQN, Hyper++ strongly outperforms Euclidean and hyperbolic baselines.

Building on the AAI framework and GVU dynamics from previous works, we define the Mathematics Fiber and show that, when paired with formal proof kernels (e.g. Lean, Coq), GVU flows on this fiber admit spectrally stable self-improvement regimes due to oracle-like verification. Our main technical result is a density theorem: under uniform tightness of agent outputs and a Lipschitz AAI functional, the subspace of batteries generated by mathematical theorem-proving and coding tasks is dense in the moduli space of batteries with respect to the evaluation metric. Coding alone is universal in this sense, while pure mathematics is not; its privilege is spectral rather than expressive.

This work is accepted to the Thirty-ninth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, 2025", "summary": "The success of modern multimodal representation learning relies on internet-scale datasets. Due to the low quality of a large fraction of raw web data, data curation has become a critical step in the training pipeline. Filtering using a trained model (i.e., teacher-based filtering) has emerged as a successful solution, leveraging a pre-trained model to compute quality scores. To explain the empirical success of teacher-based filtering, we characterize the performance of filtered contrastive learning under the standard bimodal data generation model. Denoting $\u03b7\\in(0,1]$ as the fraction of data with correctly matched modalities among $n$ paired samples, we utilize a linear contrastive learning setup to show a provable benefit of data filtering: $(i)$ the error without filtering is upper and lower bounded by $\\frac{1}{\u03b7\\sqrt{n}}$, and $(ii)$ the error with teacher-based filtering is upper bounded by $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\u03b7n}}$ in the large $\u03b7$ regime, and by $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}$ in the small $\u03b7$ regime.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc778\ud130\ub137 \uaddc\ubaa8\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc131\uacf5\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ud558\uc5ec, \ud544\ud130\ub9c1\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0 \uad50\uc0ac \uae30\ubc18 \ud544\ud130\ub9c1\uc758 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \uc124\uba85\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub192\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud544\ud130\ub9c1\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud574\uc84c\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud45c\uc900 \uc774\ubd84 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc544\ub798\uc5d0\uc11c \ud544\ud130\ub9c1\ub41c \ub300\uc870 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud2b9\uc131\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc8fc\uc5b4\uc9c4 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc798 \ub9de\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4dc\uc758 \ube44\uc728\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\ub294 \uae30\ud638 $\u03b7$\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \uc120\ud615 \ub300\uc870 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc124\uc815\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud544\ud130\ub9c1\uc758 \uc774\uc810\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud544\ud130\ub9c1 \uc5c6\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc624\ub958\ub294 $\frac{1}{\u03b7\text{sqrt}{n}}$\ub85c \uc0c1\ud558\ud55c\uc774 \uc124\uc815\ub418\uba70, \uad50\uc0ac \uae30\ubc18 \ud544\ud130\ub9c1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc624\ub958\ub294 \ud070 $\u03b7$ \uc601\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c $\frac{1}{\text{sqrt}{\u03b7n}}$\ub85c \uc0c1\ud55c\uc774, \uc791\uc740 $\u03b7$ \uc601\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c $\frac{1}{\text{sqrt}{n}}$\ub85c \uc0c1\ud55c\uc774 \uc124\uc815\ub41c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubd84\uc11d\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud544\ud130\ub9c1\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uba85\ud655\ud788 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uba70, \uad50\uc0ac \uae30\ubc18 \ud544\ud130\ub9c1\uc774 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc65c \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc778\uc9c0\ub97c \uc124\uba85\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud604\ub300\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc131\uacf5\uc740 \uc778\ud130\ub137 \uaddc\ubaa8\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub9ce\uc740 \uc591\uc758 \uc6d0\uc2dc \uc6f9 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uc9c8\uc774 \ub0ae\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc120\ubcc4\uc740 \ud6c8\ub828 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub2e8\uacc4\uac00 \ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \ud544\ud130\ub9c1(\uc989, \uad50\uc0ac \uae30\ubc18 \ud544\ud130\ub9c1)\uc740 \ud488\uc9c8 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \uacc4\uc0b0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc778 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc73c\ub85c \ub4f1\uc7a5\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uad50\uc0ac \uae30\ubc18 \ud544\ud130\ub9c1\uc758 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \uc131\uacf5\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud45c\uc900 \uc774\ubd84 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc544\ub798\uc5d0\uc11c \ud544\ud130\ub9c1\ub41c \ub300\uc870 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud2b9\uc131\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4. $n$ \uc30d \uc0d8\ud50c \uc911 \uc62c\ubc14\ub974\uac8c \uc77c\uce58\ud558\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4dc\uc758 \ube44\uc728\uc744 $\u03b7\text{\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\uba70}, \uc120\ud615 \ub300\uc870 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc124\uc815\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud544\ud130\ub9c1\uc758 \uba85\ud655\ud55c \uc774\uc810\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4: $(i)$ \ud544\ud130\ub9c1\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uc624\ub958\ub294 $\frac{1}{\u03b7\text{sqrt}{n}}$\ub85c \uc0c1\ud55c\uacfc \ud558\ud55c\uc774 \uc815\ud574\uc9c0\uba70, $(ii)$ \uad50\uc0ac \uae30\ubc18 \ud544\ud130\ub9c1 \uc2dc \uc624\ub958\ub294 \ud070 $\u03b7$ \uc601\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c $\frac{1}{\text{sqrt}{\u03b7n}}$\ub85c \uc0c1\ud55c\uc774 \uc124\uc815\ub418\uace0, \uc791\uc740 $\u03b7$ \uc601\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 $\frac{1}{\text{sqrt}{n}}$\ub85c \uc0c1\ud55c\uc774 \uc124\uc815\ub41c\ub2e4."}}

Graph Generative Models (GGMs) have emerged as a promising solution to this problem, leveraging deep learning techniques to learn the underlying distribution of real-world graphs and generate new samples that closely resemble them. Examples include approaches based on Variational Auto-Encoders, Recurrent Neural Networks, and more recently, diffusion-based models. However, the main limitation often lies in the evaluation process, which typically relies on Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) as a metric to assess the distribution of graph properties in the generated ensemble. This paper introduces a novel methodology for evaluating GGMs that overcomes the limitations of MMD, which we call RGM (Representation-aware Graph-generation Model evaluation). As a practical demonstration of our methodology, we present a comprehensive evaluation of two state-of-the-art Graph Generative Models: Graph Recurrent Attention Networks (GRAN) and Efficient and Degree-guided graph GEnerative model (EDGE). We investigate their performance in generating realistic graphs and compare them using a Geometric Deep Learning model trained on a custom dataset of synthetic and real-world graphs, specifically designed for graph classification tasks. Our findings reveal that while both models can generate graphs with certain topological properties, they exhibit significant limitations in preserving the structural characteristics that distinguish different graph domains. We also highlight the inadequacy of Maximum Mean Discrepancy as an evaluation metric for GGMs and suggest alternative approaches for future research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uadf8\ub798\ud504

While prior work largely focuses on pixel-space world models, these approaches face practical limitations in GUI settings, where predicting complex visual elements in future states is often difficult. In this work, we explore an alternative formulation of world modeling for GUI agents, where state transitions are described in natural language rather than predicting raw pixels. First, we introduce MobileWorldBench, a benchmark that evaluates the ability of vision-language models (VLMs) to function as world models for mobile GUI agents. Second, we release MobileWorld, a large-scale dataset consisting of 1.4M samples, that significantly improves the world modeling capabilities of VLMs. Finally, we propose a novel framework that integrates VLM world models into the planning framework of mobile agents, demonstrating that semantic world models can directly benefit mobile agents by improving task success rates.

While Quantum Differential Privacy (QDP) mechanisms provide theoretical worst-case guarantees, they critically lack empirical verification tools for deployed models. We introduce the first black-box privacy auditing framework for QML based on Lifted Quantum Differential Privacy, leveraging quantum canaries (strategically offset-encoded quantum states) to detect memorization and precisely quantify privacy leakage during training. Our framework establishes a rigorous mathematical connection between canary offset and trace distance bounds, deriving empirical lower bounds on privacy budget consumption that bridge the critical gap between theoretical guarantees and practical privacy verification. Comprehensive evaluations across both simulated and physical quantum hardware demonstrate our framework's effectiveness in measuring actual privacy loss in QML models, enabling robust privacy

However, the substantial computational demand restricts access to LLM almost exclusively through cloud-based service, which makes LLM-based decision support tools impractical for dairy farming. To address this gap, lightweight alternatives capable of running locally on farm hardware are required. In this work, we benchmarked 20 open-source Small Language Models (SLM) available on HuggingFace under farm-realistic computing constraints. Building on our prior work, we developed an agentic AI system that integrates five task-specific agents: literature search, web search, SQL database interaction, NoSQL database interaction, and graph generation following predictive models. Evaluation was conducted in two phases. In the first phase, five test questions were used for the initial screening to identify models capable of following basic dairy-related instructions and performing reliably in a compute-constrained environment. Models that passed this preliminary stage were then evaluated using 30 questions (five per task category mentioned above, plus one category addressing integrity and misconduct) in phase two. In results, Qwen-4B achieved superior performance across most of task categories, although showed unstable effectiveness in NoSQL database interactions through PySpark. To our knowledge, this is the first work explicitly evaluating the feasibility of SLM as engines for dairy farming decision-making, with central emphases on privacy and computational efficiency. While results highlight the promise of SLM-assisted tools for practical deployment in dairy farming, challenges remain, and fine-tuning is still needed to refine SLM performance in dairy-specific questions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uacbd\ub7c9 \ub300\uccb4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc6b0\uc720 \uc0dd\uc0b0 \ub18d\uc5c5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uacb0\uc815 \uc9c0\uc6d0 \ub3c4\uad6c

Across centers, polysomnography (PSG) recordings are traditionally scored in 30-s epochs for pragmatic, not physiological, reasons and can vary considerably in electrode count, montage, and subject characteristics. These constraints present challenges in conducting harmonized multi-center sleep studies and discovering novel, robust biomarkers on shorter timescales. Here, we present AnySleep, a deep neural network model that uses any electroencephalography (EEG) or electrooculography (EOG) data to score sleep at adjustable temporal resolutions. We trained and validated the model on over 19,000 overnight recordings from 21 datasets collected across multiple clinics, spanning nearly 200,000 hours of EEG and EOG data, to promote robust generalization across sites. The model attains state-of-the-art performance and surpasses or equals established baselines at 30-s epochs. Performance improves as more channels are provided, yet remains strong when EOG is absent or when only EOG or single EEG derivations (frontal, central, or occipital) are available. On sub-30-s timescales, the model captures short wake intrusions consistent with arousals and improves prediction of physiological characteristics (age, sex) and pathophysiological conditions (sleep apnea), relative to standard 30-s scoring. We make the model publicly available to facilitate large-scale studies with heterogeneous electrode setups and to accelerate the discovery of novel biomarkers in sleep.", "AI": {"tldr":

Existing chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting methods enhance model reasoning by eliciting intermediate steps, but suffer from two major limitations: First, their uniform application tends to induce overthinking on simple tasks. Second, they lack intention abstraction in code generation, such as explicitly modeling core algorithmic design and efficiency, leading models to focus on surface-level structures while neglecting the global problem objective. Inspired by the cognitive economy principle of engaging structured reasoning only when necessary to conserve cognitive resources, we propose RoutingGen, a novel difficulty-aware routing framework that dynamically adapts prompting strategies for code generation. For simple tasks, it adopts few-shot prompting; for more complex ones, it invokes a structured reasoning strategy, termed Intention Chain-of-Thought (ICoT), which we introduce to guide the model in capturing task intention, such as the core algorithmic logic and its time complexity. Experiments across three models and six standard code generation benchmarks show that RoutingGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in most settings, while reducing total token usage by 46.37% on average across settings. Furthermore, ICoT outperforms six existing prompting baselines on challenging benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "RoutingGen\uc740 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub09c\uc774\ub3c4 \uc778\uc2dd \ub77c\uc6b0\ud305 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc27d\uace0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ub2e4\uc774\ub098\ubbf9\ud558\uac8c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc778\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uccb4\uc778 \uc624\ube0c \uc0dd\uac01(CoT) \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uacfc\ub3c4\ud55c \uc0ac\uace0\ub97c \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\uace0 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \uc758\ub3c4 \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "RoutingGen\uc740 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc801\uc740 \uc0f7 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud305\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uace0, \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 Intention Chain-of-Thought(ICoT)\ub77c\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \uc758\ub3c4\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc548\ub0b4\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "RoutingGen\uc740 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uc5ec\uc12f \uac00\uc9c0 \ud45c\uc900 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, \ud3c9\uade0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\uccb4 \ud1a0\ud070 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub7c9\uc744 46.37% \uc904\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "ICoT\ub294 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc778 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc5ec\uc12f \uac00\uc9c0 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc0dd\uc131 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \ud070 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uc9c0\ub2c8\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \uccb4\uc778 \uc624\ube0c \uc0dd\uac01(CoT) \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc911\uac04 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub97c \uc774\ub04c\uc5b4\ub0b4\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \ud55c\uacc4\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4. \uccab\uc9f8, \uc774\ub4e4\uc758 \uade0\uc77c\ud55c \uc801\uc6a9\uc740 \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uacfc\ub3c4\ud55c \uc0ac\uace0\ub97c \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4. \ub458\uc9f8, \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \ud575\uc2ec \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \uc124\uacc4\uc640 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \uc758\ub3c4 \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc804\uccb4 \ubb38\uc81c \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ubb34\uc2dc\ud558\uace0 \ud45c\uba74 \uad6c\uc870\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\ud558\uac8c \ub41c\ub2e4. \uc778\uc9c0 \uc790\uc6d0\uc744 \uc808\uc57d\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud544\uc694\ud560 \ub54c\ub9cc \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc778\uc9c0 \uacbd\uc81c \uc6d0\ub9ac\uc5d0 \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc544, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub09c\uc774\ub3c4 \uc778\uc2dd \ub77c\uc6b0\ud305 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 RoutingGen\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uc801\uc740 \uc0f7 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud305\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uace0, \ub354 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \ud575\uc2ec \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \ub17c\ub9ac\uc640 \uc2dc\uac04 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131 \uac19\uc740 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc758\ub3c4\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc548\ub0b4\ud558\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \uc804\ub7b5\uc778 Intention Chain-of-Thought(ICoT)\ub97c \ud638\ucd9c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uc5ec\uc12f \uac00\uc9c0 \ud45c\uc900 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\uc2dc\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, RoutingGen\uc740 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uc124\uc815\ubcc4\ub85c \ud3c9\uade0 46.37%\uc758 \uc804\uccb4 \ud1a0\ud070 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub7c9\uc744 \uc904\uc778\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, ICoT\ub294 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5ec\uc12f \uac00\uc9c0 \uae30\uc874 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

Noninvasive electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI) combined with deep learning (DL) approaches for estimating intracardiac electrograms (EGMs) from body surface potentials (BSPMs) has shown promise, but progress is hindered by the limited availability of paired BSPM-EGM datasets. To address this limitation, we investigate variational autoencoders (VAEs) for the generation of synthetic multichannel atrial EGMs. Two models are proposed: a sinus rhythm-specific VAE (VAE-S) and a class-conditioned VAE (VAE-C) trained on both sinus rhythm and AF signals. Generated EGMs are evaluated using morphological, spectral, and distributional similarity metrics. VAE-S achieves higher fidelity with respect to in silico EGMs, while VAE-C enables rhythm-specific generation at the expense of reduced sinus reconstruction quality.

Markovian Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches are not suitable for such tasks, while RL with non-Markovian reward decision processes (NMRDPs) enables agents to tackle temporal-dependency tasks. This approach has long been known to lack formal guarantees on both (near-)optimality and sample efficiency. We contribute to solving both issues with QR-MAX, a novel model-based algorithm for discrete NMRDPs that factorizes Markovian transition learning from non-Markovian reward handling via reward machines. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model-based RL algorithm for discrete-action NMRDPs that exploits this factorization to obtain PAC convergence to $\\varepsilon$-optimal policies with polynomial sample complexity. We then extend QR-MAX to continuous state spaces with Bucket-QR-MAX, a SimHash-based discretiser that preserves the same factorized structure and achieves fast and stable learning without manual gridding or function approximation. We experimentally compare our method with modern state-of-the-art model-based RL approaches on environments of increasing complexity, showing a significant improvement in sample efficiency and increased robustness in finding optimal policies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ube44 \ub9c8\ucf54\ud504 \ud615\ud0dc\uc758 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uacb0\uc815

However, they still struggle with complex tasks that necessitate dynamic and iterative focusing on fine-grained visual regions to achieve precise grounding and diagnosis. We introduce Ophiuchus, a versatile, tool-augmented framework that equips an MLLM to (i) decide when additional visual evidence is needed, (ii) determine where to probe and ground within the medical image, and (iii) seamlessly weave the relevant sub-image content back into an interleaved, multimodal chain of thought. In contrast to prior approaches limited by the performance ceiling of specialized tools, Ophiuchus integrates the model's inherent grounding and perception capabilities with external tools, thereby fostering higher-level reasoning. The core of our method is a three-stage training strategy: cold-start training with tool-integrated reasoning data to achieve basic tool selection and adaptation for inspecting key regions; self-reflection fine-tuning to strengthen reflective reasoning and encourage revisiting tool outputs; and Agentic Tool Reinforcement Learning to directly optimize task-specific rewards and emulate expert-like diagnostic behavior. Extensive experiments show that Ophiuchus consistently outperforms both closed-source and open-source SOTA methods across diverse medical benchmarks, including VQA, detection, and reasoning-based segmentation.

To address the over-smoothing problem in deep GNNs, global attention was initially introduced, eliminating the necessity for using deep GNNs. However, through empirical and theoretical analysis, we verify that the introduced global attention exhibits severe over-smoothing, causing node representations to become indistinguishable due to its inherent low-pass filtering. This effect is even stronger than that observed in GNNs. To mitigate this, we propose PageRank Transformer (ParaFormer), which features a PageRank-enhanced attention module designed to mimic the behavior of deep Transformers. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that ParaFormer mitigates over-smoothing by functioning as an adaptive-pass filter. Experiments show that ParaFormer achieves consistent performance improvements across both node classification and graph classification tasks on 11 datasets ranging from thousands to millions of nodes, validating its efficacy.

Davis"], "title": "G\u00f6del's Poetry", "comment": "24 pages, 1 figure", "summary": "Formal, automated theorem proving has long been viewed as a challenge to artificial intelligence. We introduce here a new approach to computer theorem proving, one that employs specialized language models for Lean4 proof generation combined with recursive decomposition of difficult theorems into simpler entailing propositions. These models are coordinated through a multi-agent architecture that orchestrates autoformalization (if required), proof generation, decomposition of difficult theorems into simpler entailing propositions, and recursive proof (and/or decomposition) of these propositions. Without decomposition, we achieve a 90.4% pass rate on miniF2F. With decomposition, this is significantly improved. A key technical contribution lies in our extension of the Kimina Lean Server with abstract syntax tree (AST) parsing capabilities to facilitate automated, recursive proof decomposition. The system is made available on PyPI as goedels-poetry (at https://pypi.org/project/goedels-poetry ), and the open-source implementation KellyJDavis/goedels-poetry (at https://github.com/KellyJDavis/goedels-poetry ) facilitates both adaptation to alternative language models and extension with custom functionality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 Lean4 \uc99d\uba85 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc804\ubb38\ud654\ub41c \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \uc815\ub9ac\ub97c \ub354 \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \uba85\uc81c\ub85c \uc7ac\uadc0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud130 \uc815\ub9ac \uc99d\uba85 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud615\uc2dd\uc801\uc774\uba70 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uc815\ub9ac \uc99d\uba85\uc740 \uc624\ub7ab\ub3d9\uc548 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5\uc758 \ub3c4\uc804\uacfc\uc81c\ub85c \uc5ec\uaca8\uc84c\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc790\ub3d9 \ud615\uc2dd\ud654, \uc99d\uba85 \uc0dd\uc131, \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \uc815\ub9ac\uc758 \uba85\uc81c\ub85c\uc758 \ubd84\ud574 \ubc0f \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uba85\uc81c\uc758 \uc7ac\uadc0\uc801 \uc99d\uba85\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ubd84\ud574 \uc5c6\uc774 miniF2F\uc5d0\uc11c 90.4%\uc758 \ud1b5\uacfc\uc728\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, \ubd84\ud574\ub97c \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uba74 \uc774 \uacb0\uacfc\uac00 \ud06c\uac8c \uac1c\uc120\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 PyPI\uc5d0\uc11c goedels-poetry\ub85c \uc81c\uacf5\ub418\uba70, \uc624\ud508 \uc18c\uc2a4 \uad6c\ud604\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e4\ub978 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c\uc758 \uc801\uc751\uacfc \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc815\uc758 \uae30\ub2a5 \ud655\uc7a5\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud615\uc2dd\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uc815\ub9ac \uc99d\uba85\uc740 \uc624\ub7ab\ub3d9\uc548 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5\uc758 \ub3c4\uc804\uc73c\ub85c \uc5ec\uaca8\uc838 \uc654\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 Lean4 \uc99d\uba85 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc804\ubb38\ud654\ub41c \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \uc815\ub9ac\ub97c \ub354 \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \uba85\uc81c\ub85c \uc7ac\uadc0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ud544\uc694\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc790\ub3d9 \ud615\uc2dd\ud654, \uc99d\uba85 \uc0dd\uc131, \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \uc815\ub9ac\uc758 \ubd84\ud574 \ubc0f \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uba85\uc81c\uc758 \uc7ac\uadc0\uc801 \uc99d\uba85\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud611\ub825\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubd84\ud574 \uc5c6\uc774\ub294 miniF2F\uc5d0\uc11c 90.4%\uc758 \ud1b5\uacfc\uc728\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, \ubd84\ud574\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774 \uacb0\uacfc\uac00 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc8fc\uc694 \uae30\uc220 \uae30\uc5ec\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uc7ac\uadc0\uc801 \uc99d\uba85 \ubd84\ud574\ub97c \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 Kimina Lean Server\uc5d0 \ucd94\uc0c1 \uad6c\ubb38 \ud2b8\ub9ac(AST) \ud30c\uc2f1 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \ud655\uc7a5\ud55c \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 PyPI\uc5d0\uc11c goedels-poetry\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc624\ud508 \uc18c\uc2a4 \uad6c\ud604\uc778 KellyJDavis/goedels-poetry\ub294 \ub2e4\ub978 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c\uc758 \uc801\uc751\uacfc \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc815\uc758 \uae30\ub2a5\uc758 \ud655\uc7a5\uc744 \uc6a9\uc774\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Early identification of patients at risk for deterioration is essential not only for patient care quality monitoring but also for physician care management. However, translating varied data streams into accurate and interpretable risk assessments poses significant challenges due to inconsistent data formats. We develop a multimodal machine learning framework, the Early Warning Index (EWI), to predict the aggregate risk of ICU admission, emergency response team dispatch, and mortality. Key to EWI's design is a human-in-the-loop process: clinicians help determine alert thresholds and interpret model outputs, which are enhanced by explainable outputs using Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to highlight clinical and operational factors (e.g., scheduled surgeries, ward census) driving each patient's risk. We deploy EWI in a hospital dashboard that stratifies patients into three risk tiers. Using a dataset of 18,633 unique patients at a large U.S. hospital, our approach automatically extracts features from both structured and unstructured electronic health record (EHR) data and achieves C-statistics of 0.796. It is currently used as a triage tool for proactively managing at-risk patients. The proposed approach saves physicians valuable time by automatically sorting patients of varying risk levels, allowing them to concentrate on patient care rather than sifting through complex EHR data. By further pinpointing specific risk drivers, the proposed model provides data-informed adjustments to caregiver scheduling and allocation of critical resources. As a result, clinicians and administrators can avert downstream complications, including costly procedures or high readmission rates and improve overall patient flow.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 ICU \uc785\uc6d0, \uc751\uae09 \ub300\uc751 \ud300 \ud30c\uacac \ubc0f \uc0ac\ub9dd\ub960\uc758 \uc9d1\ud569\uc801 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 \uc870\uae30 \uacbd\uace0 \uc9c0\uc218(EWI)\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc758\ub8cc\uae30\uad00\uc5d0\uc11c \uc784\uc0c1 \ubc0f \uc6b4\uc601 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uc591\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc911\ub300\ud55c \uc0ac\uac74\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uba70, \ud658\uc790\uc758 \uc545\ud654 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc870\uae30\uc5d0 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "EWI\ub294 \uc784\uc0c1\uc758\uac00 \uacbd\uace0 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \uc124\uc815\ud558\uace0 \ubaa8\ub378 \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \ud574\uc11d\ud558\ub294 \uc778\uac04-\ub8e8\ud504 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uba70, SHAP\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac01 \ud658\uc790\uc758 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc720\ubc1c\ud558\ub294 \uc784\uc0c1\uc801 \ubc0f \uc6b4\uc601\uc801 \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 18,633\uba85\uc758 \uace0\uc720\ud55c \ud658\uc790 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec C \ud1b5\uacc4\uce58 0.796\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, EWI\ub294 \ud604\uc7ac \uc704\ud5d8 \ud658\uc790\ub97c \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubd84\ub958 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc758\uc0ac\ub4e4\uc774 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c EHR \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \ub300\uc2e0 \ud658\uc790 \uce58\ub8cc\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\uc5ec \uadc0\uc911\ud55c \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \uc808\uc57d\ud558\uace0, \ud2b9\uc815 \uc704\ud5d8 \uc694\uc778\uc744 \uc815\ud655\ud788 \uc9da\uc5b4\ub0b4\uc5b4 \uac04\ud638\uc0ac \uc77c\uc815 \ubc0f \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc790\uc6d0 \ud560\ub2f9\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubcd1\uc6d0\uc740 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc784\uc0c1 \ubc0f \uc6b4\uc601 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uc591\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc911\ub300\ud55c \uc0ac\uac74\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc608\uce21\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud658\uc790\uc758 \uc545\ud654 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc870\uae30\uc5d0 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ud658\uc790 \uce58\ub8cc \ud488\uc9c8 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\uacfc \uc758\uc0ac \uad00\ub9ac \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud750\ub984\uc744 \uc815\ud655\ud558\uace0 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc704\ud5d8 \ud3c9\uac00\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud615\uc2dd \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 ICU \uc785\uc6d0, \uc751\uae09 \ub300\uc751 \ud300 \ud30c\uacac \ubc0f \uc0ac\ub9dd\ub960\uc758 \uc9d1\ud569\uc801 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 \uc870\uae30 \uacbd\uace0 \uc9c0\uc218(EWI)\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Consequently, the paper assesses the effectiveness of LLMs in automated ontology development and the enhancement achieved through human-LLM collaboration.\n  Initial ontology generation was performed using One Shot (OS) and Chain of Thought (CoT) prompts, demonstrating the capability of LLMs to autonomously construct ontologies for PD monitoring and alerting. However, these outputs were not comprehensive and required substantial human refinement to enhance their completeness and accuracy.\n  X-HCOME, a hybrid ontology engineering approach that combines human expertise with LLM capabilities, showed significant improvements in ontology comprehensiveness. This methodology resulted in ontologies that are very similar to those constructed by experts.\n  Further experimentation with SimX-HCOME+, another hybrid methodology emphasizing continuous human supervision and iterative refinement, highlighted the importance of ongoing human involvement. This approach led to the creation of more comprehensive and accurate ontologies.\n  Overall, the paper underscores the potential of human-LLM collaboration in advancing ontology engineering, particularly in complex domains like PD. The results suggest promising directions for future research, including the development of specialized GPT models for ontology construction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud30c\ud0a8\uc2a8\ubcd1 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1 \ubc0f \uacbd\uace0 \uc628\ud1a8\ub85c\uc9c0\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \ud1b5\ud569\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub294 LLM\uc774 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \uc628\ud1a8\ub85c\uc9c0\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0 \ub610\ub294 \uc778\uac04-LMM \ud611\ub825\uc774 \uc774 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 One Shot(OS) \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8, Chain of Thought(CoT) \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8, X-HCOME \ubc0f SimX-HCOME+\ub77c\ub294 \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc9c4\ud589\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\ucd08\uae30 \uc628\ud1a8\ub85c\uc9c0 \uc0dd\uc131\uc740 OS \ubc0f CoT \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc84c\uc73c\ub098, LLM \ucd9c\ub825\uc774 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc544 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc815\uc81c\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud588\ub2e4.

Here, we aim to ask whether an agent can similarly acquire human-like reasoning from interaction and keep improving with more experience. To study this, we introduce a Game-to-Unseen (G2U) benchmark of 1,000+ heterogeneous games that exhibit significant visual domain gaps. Existing approaches, including VLMs and world models, struggle to capture underlying physics and causality since they are not focused on core mechanisms and overfit to visual details. VLM/VLA agents reason but lack look-ahead in interactive settings, while world models imagine but imitate visual patterns rather than analyze physics and causality. We therefore propose IPR (Interactive Physical Reasoner), using world-model rollouts to score and reinforce a VLM's policy, and introduce PhysCode, a physics-centric action code aligning semantic intent with dynamics to provide a shared action space for prediction and reasoning. Pretrained on 1,000+ games, our IPR performs robustly on levels from primitive intuition to goal-driven reasoning, and even surpasses GPT-5 overall. We find that performance improves with more training games and interaction steps, and that the model also zero-shot transfers to unseen games.

However, their widespread commercialization is hindered due to their low transferability across diverse terminals. This transferability challenge stems from three limitations: high reliance on port operational specialists, a high demand for terminal-specific data, and time-consuming manual deployment processes. Leveraging the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), this paper proposes PortAgent, an LLM-driven vehicle dispatching agent that fully automates the VDS transferring workflow. It bears three features: (1) no need for port operations specialists; (2) low need of data; and (3) fast deployment. Specifically, specialist dependency is eliminated by the Virtual Expert Team (VET). The VET collaborates with four virtual experts, including a Knowledge Retriever, Modeler, Coder, and Debugger, to emulate a human expert team for the VDS transferring workflow. These experts specialize in the domain of terminal VDS via a few-shot example learning approach. Through this approach, the experts are able to learn VDS-domain knowledge from a few VDS examples. These examples are retrieved via a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism, mitigating the high demand for terminal-specific data. Furthermore, an automatic VDS design workflow is established among these experts to avoid extra manual interventions. In this workflow, a self-correction loop inspired by the LLM Reflexion framework is created", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108 \ud130\ubbf8\ub110\uc758 \ucc28\ub7c9 \ubc30\ucc28 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc804\ud658 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 LLM \uae30\ubc18\uc758 PortAgent\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108 \ud130\ubbf8\ub110\uc758 \uc6b4\uc601 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ucc28\ub7c9 \ubc30\ucc28 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud130\ubbf8\ub110 \uac04\uc758 \ub0ae\uc740 \uc804\ud658 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc0c1\uc5c5\ud654\uac00 \uc800\ud574\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "PortAgent\ub294 \ud3ec\ud2b8 \uc6b4\uc601 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc5c6\uc774, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc694\uad6c\uac00 \uc801\uace0, \ube60\ub978 \ubc30\ud3ec\uac00 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c LLM \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ucc28\ub7c9 \ubc30\ucc28 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c\uc11c, \uac00\uc0c1 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \ud300\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec VDS \uc804\ud658 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \uc644\uc804 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uac00\uc0c1 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \ud300\uc774 VDS \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uc801\uc740 \uc218\uc758 \uc0ac\ub840\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368, \ud130\ubbf8\ub110 \ud2b9\ud654 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc694\uad6c\ub7c9\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uace0 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c VDS \uc124\uacc4 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \ucc28\ub7c9 \ubc30\ucc28 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud558\uace0, \uc218\ub3d9 \uac1c\uc785\uc744 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\uc758 \uae38\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucc28\ub7c9 \ubc30\ucc28 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(VDS)\uc740 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108 \ud130\ubbf8\ub110(ACT)\uc758 \uc6b4\uc601 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud130\ubbf8\ub110 \uac04\uc758 \ub0ae\uc740 \uc804\ud658 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc0c1\uc5c5\ud654\uac00 \uc800\ud574\ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc804\ud658 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc81c\uc57d\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ube44\ub86f\ub41c\ub2e4: \ud3ec\ud2b8 \uc6b4\uc601 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub192\uc740 \uc758\uc874\ub3c4, \ud130\ubbf8\ub110 \ud2b9\ud654 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub192\uc740 \uc218\uc694, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc18c\ubaa8\uc801\uc778 \uc218\ub3d9 \ubc30\ud3ec \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \ucd9c\ud604\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec VDS \uc804\ud658 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc644\uc804 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud558\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ucc28\ub7c9 \ubc30\ucc28 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc778 PortAgent\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4: (1) \ud3ec\ud2b8 \uc6b4\uc601 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uac00 \ud544\uc694 \uc5c6\ub2e4; (2) \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc694\uad6c\uac00 \ub0ae\ub2e4; (3) \ube60\ub978 \ubc30\ud3ec\uac00 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\ub2e4. \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \uc804\ubb38\uc758\uc874\uc744 \uac00\uc0c1 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \ud300(VET)\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc81c\uac70\ud55c\ub2e4.

We introduce the first Model Context Protocol (MCP) server suite for SPECFEM (supporting 2D, 3D Cartesian, and 3D Globe versions), which decomposes the entire simulation process into discrete, agent-executable tools spanning from parameter generation and mesh partitioning to solver execution and visualization. This approach enables a paradigm shift from file-driven to intent-driven conversational interactions. The framework supports both fully automated execution and human-in-the-loop collaboration, allowing researchers to guide simulation strategies in real time and retain scientific decision-making authority while significantly reducing tedious low-level operations. Validated through multiple case studies, the workflow operates seamlessly in both autonomous and interactive modes, yielding high-fidelity results consistent with standard baselines. As the first application of MCP technology to computational seismology, this study significantly lowers the entry barrier, enhances reproducibility, and offers a promising avenue for advancing computational geophysics toward AI-assisted and automated scientific research.

Existing strategies such as Chain-of-Thought and ReAct rely on implicit state tracking and lack an explicit problem representation. Inspired by classical AI planning, we propose Model-First Reasoning (MFR), a two-phase paradigm in which the LLM first constructs an explicit model of the problem, defining entities, state variables, actions, and constraints, before generating a solution plan. Across multiple planning domains, including medical scheduling, route planning, resource allocation, logic puzzles, and procedural synthesis, MFR reduces constraint violations and improves solution quality compared to Chain-of-Thought and ReAct. Ablation studies show that the explicit modeling phase is critical for these gains. Our results suggest that many LLM planning failures stem from representational deficiencies rather than reasoning limitations, highlighting explicit modeling as a key component for robust and interpretable AI agents.

In this work, we systematically analyze UTs variants and show that improvements on ARC-AGI primarily arise from the recurrent inductive bias and strong nonlinear components of Transformer, rather than from elaborate architectural designs. Motivated by this finding, we propose the Universal Reasoning Model (URM), which enhances the UT with short convolution and truncated backpropagation. Our approach substantially improves reasoning performance, achieving state-of-the-art 53.8% pass@1 on ARC-AGI 1 and 16.0% pass@1 on ARC-AGI 2.
