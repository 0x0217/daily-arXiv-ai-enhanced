While conventional coverage formulations achieve effective spatial allocation when an accurate reference map is available, their performance deteriorates under uncertain or biased priors. The proposed method introduces an adaptive and self-correcting mechanism that enables agents to iteratively refine local density estimates within an optimal transport-based framework, ensuring theoretical consistency and scalability. A dual multilayer perceptron (MLP) module enhances adaptivity by inferring local mean-variance statistics and regulating virtual uncertainty for long-unvisited regions, mitigating stagnation around local minima. Theoretical analysis rigorously proves convergence under the Wasserstein metric, while simulation results demonstrate that the proposed AI-augmented Density-Driven Optimal Control consistently achieves robust and precise alignment with the ground-truth density, yielding substantially higher-fidelity reconstruction of complex multi-modal spatial distributions compared with conventional decentralized baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud55c\uc815\ub41c \uac10\uc9c0 \ubc0f \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8(\ub2e4\uc911

In this work, we bridge the gap to real-world network structures by proposing a rigorous framework for MFC on large sparse graphs. We redefine the system state as a probability measure over decorated rooted neighborhoods, effectively capturing local heterogeneity. Our central contribution is a theoretical foundation for scalable reinforcement learning in this setting. We prove horizon-dependent locality: for finite-horizon problems, an agent's optimal policy at time t depends strictly on its (T-t)-hop neighborhood. This result renders the infinite-dimensional control problem tractable and underpins a novel Dynamic Programming Principle (DPP) on the lifted space of neighborhood distributions. Furthermore, we formally and experimentally justify the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for actor-critic algorithms in this context. Our framework naturally recovers classical MFC as a degenerate case while enabling efficient, theoretically grounded control on complex sparse topologies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ud76c\uc18c \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uade0\uc7a5 \ud1b5\uc81c(MFC)\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ud2c0\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ucc28\uc6d0 \uc800\uc8fc \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \ucc28\uc6d0 \uc800\uc8fc\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud76c\uc18c \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uade0\uc7a5 \ud1b5\uc81c\uc758 \uc5c4\ubc00\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \uc7a5\uc2dd\ub41c \ub8e8\ud2b8 \uc774\uc6c3\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud655\ub960 \uce21\ub3c4\ub85c \uc7ac\uc815\uc758\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc720\ud55c \uae30\uac04 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801 \uc815\ucc45\uc740 (T-t)-\ud649 \uc774\uc6c3\uc5d0 \uc5c4\ubc00\ud788 \uc758\uc874\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ubb34\ud55c \ucc28\uc6d0\uc758 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8f0 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud558\uba70, \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud76c\uc18c \ud1a0\ud3f4\ub85c\uc9c0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uadfc\uac70\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud3c9\uade0\uc7a5 \ud1b5\uc81c(MFC)\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \ucc28\uc6d0 \uc800\uc8fc\uc758 \uc800\uc8fc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubc00\uc9d1\ub41c \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \uad50\ud658 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uac00\uc815\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ud76c\uc18c \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc5d0\uc11c MFC\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc5c4\ubc00\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\uc81c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uad6c\uc870\uc640\uc758 \uac04\uadf9\uc744 \uba54\uc6c1\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \uc7a5\uc2dd\ub41c \ub8e8\ud2b8 \uc774\uc6c3\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud655\ub960 \uce21\ub3c4\ub85c \uc7ac\uc815\uc758\ud558\uc5ec \uc9c0\uc5ed \uc774\uc9c8\uc131\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc911\uc559 \uae30\uc5ec\ub294 \uc774 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uae30\ucd08\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc218\ud3c9\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc720\ud55c \uae30\uac04 \ubb38\uc81c\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0, \uc2dc\uac04 t\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801 \uc815\ucc45\uc740 \uc5c4\ubc00\ud788 (T-t)-\ud649 \uc774\uc6c3\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ubb34\ud55c \ucc28\uc6d0\uc758 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8f0 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud558\uba70, \uc774\uc6c3 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc758 \ud655\uc7a5\ub41c \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub3d9\uc801 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d \uc6d0\ub9ac(DPP)\ub97c \ub4b7\ubc1b\uce68\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0\uc11c \uc561\ud130-\ud06c\ub9ac\ud2f1 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(GNN)\uc758 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \uacf5\uc2dd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubc0f \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\ub2f9\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uace0\uc804\uc801\uc778 MFC\ub97c \ud1f4\ud589\uc801 \uc0ac\ub840\ub85c \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7fd\uac8c \ud68c\ubcf5\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud76c\uc18c \ud1a0\ud3f4\ub85c\uc9c0\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uadfc\uac70\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

We study a heterogeneous multi-step binary communication game where agents differ in modality and lack perceptual grounding. Despite perceptual misalignment, multimodal systems converge to class-consistent messages grounded in perceptual input. Unimodal systems communicate more efficiently, using fewer bits and achieving lower classification entropy, while multimodal agents require greater information exchange and exhibit higher uncertainty. Bit perturbation experiments provide strong evidence that meaning is encoded in a distributional rather than compositional manner, as each bit's contribution depends on its surrounding pattern. Finally, interoperability analyses show that systems trained in different perceptual worlds fail to directly communicate, but limited fine-tuning enables successful cross-system communication. This work positions emergent communication as a framework for studying how agents adapt and transfer representations across heterogeneous modalities, opening new directions for both theory and

We introduce a self-improving, cache-optional Planner-Auditor framework that improves safety and reliability by decoupling generation from deterministic validation and targeted replay.\n  Materials and Methods: We implemented an agentic, retrospective, FHIR-native evaluation pipeline using MIMIC-IV-on-FHIR. For each patient, the Planner (LLM) generates a structured discharge action plan with an explicit confidence estimate. The Auditor is a deterministic module that evaluates multi-task coverage, tracks calibration (Brier score, ECE proxies), and monitors action-distribution drift. The framework supports two-tier self-improvement: (i) within-episode regeneration when enabled, and (ii) cross-episode discrepancy buffering with replay for high-confidence, low-coverage cases.\n  Results: While context caching improved performance over baseline, the self-improvement loop was the primary driver of gains, increasing task coverage from 32% to 86%. Calibration improved substantially, with reduced Brier/ECE and fewer high-confidence misses. Discrepancy buffering further corrected persistent high-confidence omissions during replay.\n  Discussion: Feedback-driven regeneration and targeted replay act as effective control mechanisms to reduce omissions and improve confidence reliability in structured clinical planning.

Proof of Quality provides scalable verification by sampling evaluator nodes that score candidate outputs, then aggregating their scores into a consensus signal that determines rewards. However, evaluator heterogeneity and malicious score manipulation can distort consensus and inflate payouts, which weakens incentive alignment in open participation settings.\n  This paper extends a cost-aware Proof of Quality mechanism by adding adversary-resilient consensus formation. We study robust aggregation rules, including median and trimmed mean, and an adaptive trust-weighted consensus that updates evaluator weights from deviation signals. Using question answering and summarization workloads with a ground truth proxy for offline analysis, we quantify evaluator reliability and show strong variance across evaluators, including task-dependent misalignment that can invert correlations. We then evaluate robustness under four adversarial strategies, including noise injection, boosting, sabotage, and intermittent manipulation, across a sweep of malicious ratios and evaluator sample sizes. Our results show that robust aggregation improves consensus alignment with the ground truth proxy and reduces sensitivity to noisy and strategic attacks compared with simple averaging. We further characterize the operational trade-off introduced by evaluator sampling, where larger evaluator sets reduce evaluator rewards and increase payoff variance while inference rewards remain relatively stable in our configuration. These findings motivate robust consensus as a default component for cost-aware Proof of Quality and provide practical guidance for selecting evaluator sampling parameters under adversarial risk and resource constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ube44\uc6a9 \uc778\uc2dd \ud488\uc9c8 \uc99d\uba85 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uc5ec \uc801\ub300\uc801

While \"LLM-as-a-Judge\" offers scalability, judge imperfections, noise, and bias can invalidate statistical guarantees. We introduce a \"Noisy but Valid\" hypothesis testing framework to address this. By leveraging a small human-labelled calibration set to estimate the judge's True Positive and False Positive Rates (TPR/FPR), we derive a variance-corrected critical threshold applied to a large judge-labelled dataset. Crucially, our framework theoretically guarantees finite-sample Type-I error control (validity) despite calibration uncertainty. This distinguishes our work from Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI), positioning our method as a diagnostic tool that explicitly models judge behavior rather than a black-box estimator. Our contributions include: (1) Theoretical Guarantees: We derive the exact conditions under which noisy testing yields higher statistical power than direct evaluation; (2) Empirical Validation: Experiments on Jigsaw Comment, Hate Speech and SafeRLHF confirm our theory; (3) The Oracle Gap: We reveal a significant performance gap between practical methods and the theoretical \"Oracle\" (perfectly known judge parameters), quantifying the cost of estimation. Specifically, we provide the first systematic treatment of the imperfect-judge setting, yielding interpretable diagnostics of judge reliability and clarifying how evaluation power depends on judge quality, dataset size, and certification levels. Together, these results sharpen understanding of statistical evaluation with LLM judges, and highlight trade-offs among competing inferential tools.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc548\uc804 \uae30\uc900 \uc774\ud558\uc758 \uc2e4\ud328\uc728\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud558\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc778\uc99d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uac00\uc124 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc778\uc99d\uc740 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc911\uc694\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.

One of the most well-known frameworks for epistemic planning is Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL), which offers an rich and natural semantics for modelling problems in this setting. The high expressive power provided by DEL make DEL-based epistemic planning a challenging problem to tackle both theoretically, and in practical implementations. As a result, existing epistemic planners often target different DEL fragments, and typically rely on ad hoc languages to represent benchmarks, and sometimes no language at all. This fragmentation hampers comparison, reuse, and systematic benchmark development. We address these issues by introducing the Epistemic Planning Domain Definition Language (EPDDL). EPDDL provides a unique PDDL-like representation that captures the entire DEL semantics, enabling uniform specification of epistemic planning tasks. Our contributions are threefold: 1. A formal development of abstract event models, a novel representation for epistemic actions used to define the semantics of our language; 2.

Existing data analytics agents are predominantly limited to processing structured data, failing to activate and correlate this high-value visual information, thus creating a significant gap with industrial needs. To bridge this gap, we introduce DataCross, a novel benchmark and collaborative agent framework for unified, insight-driven analysis across heterogeneous data modalities. DataCrossBench comprises 200 end-to-end analysis tasks across finance, healthcare, and other domains. It is constructed via a human-in-the-loop reverse-synthesis pipeline, ensuring realistic complexity, cross-source dependency, and verifiable ground truth. The benchmark categorizes tasks into three difficulty tiers to evaluate agents' capabilities in visual table extraction, cross-modal alignment, and multi-step joint reasoning. We also propose the DataCrossAgent framework, inspired by the \"divide-and-conquer\" workflow of human analysts. It employs specialized sub-agents, each an expert on a specific data source, which are coordinated via a structured workflow of Intra-source Deep Exploration, Key Source Identification, and Contextual Cross-pollination. A novel reReAct mechanism enables robust code generation and debugging for factual verification.

In particular, fine-tuned models are highly vulnerable, as they are often fine-tuned on small and private datasets. Membership inference attacks (MIAs) are used to assess privacy risks by determining whether a specific sample was part of a model's training data. Existing MIAs against diffusion models either assume obtaining the intermediate results or require auxiliary datasets for training the shadow model. In this work, we utilized a critical yet overlooked vulnerability: the widely used noise schedules fail to fully eliminate semantic information in the images, resulting in residual semantic signals even at the maximum noise step. We empirically demonstrate that the fine-tuned diffusion model captures hidden correlations between the residual semantics in initial noise and the original images. Building on this insight, we propose a simple yet effective membership inference attack, which injects semantic information into the initial noise and infers membership by analyzing the model's generation result. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the semantic initial noise can strongly reveal membership information, highlighting the vulnerability of diffusion models to MIAs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ud655\uc0b0

While valuable, these evaluations neglect the inherently iterative and adaptive nature of scientific discovery. We introduce MAterials Discovery Environments (MADE), a novel framework for benchmarking end-to-end autonomous materials discovery pipelines. MADE simulates closed-loop discovery campaigns in which an agent or algorithm proposes, evaluates, and refines candidate materials under a constrained oracle budget, capturing the sequential and resource-limited nature of real discovery workflows. We formalize discovery as a search for thermodynamically stable compounds relative to a given convex hull, and evaluate efficacy and efficiency via comparison to baseline algorithms. The framework is flexible; users can compose discovery agents from interchangeable components such as generative models, filters, and planners, enabling the study of arbitrary workflows ranging from fixed pipelines to fully agentic systems with tool use and adaptive decision making. We demonstrate this by conducting systematic experiments across a family of systems, enabling ablation of components in discovery pipelines, and comparison of how methods scale with system complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "MADE\ub294 \uc790\uc728 \uc7ac\ub8cc \ubc1c\uacac \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud0b9\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc608\uc0b0 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uc7ac\ub8cc \ud6c4\ubcf4\ub97c \uc81c\uc548, \ud3c9\uac00, \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ub2eb\ud78c \ub8e8\ud504 \ubc1c\uacac \ucea0\ud398\uc778\uc744 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc7ac\ub8cc \ubc1c\uacac \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub294 \uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc608\uce21 \uc791\uc5c5\uc774\ub098 \uace0\ub9bd\ub41c \uc5f0\uc0b0 \ud558\uc704 \uc791\uc5c5\ub9cc\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uba70, \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \ubc1c\uacac\uc758 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc778 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc744 \uac04\uacfc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "MADE\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\ub4e4\uc774 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378, \ud544\ud130 \ubc0f \uacc4\ud68d\uc790\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc0c1\ud638 \uad50\ud658 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub85c \ubc1c\uacac \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uad6c\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\uc5ec \uace0\uc815\ub41c \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9 \ubc0f \uc801\uc751\uc801 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uc644\uc804\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \uc774\ub974\ub294 \uc784\uc758\uc758 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud750\ub984\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "MADE\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\ub4e4\uc774 \ubc1c\uacac \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\uc758 \uc81c\uac70 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uace0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ub3c4\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ud655\uc7a5\uc744 \ube44\uad50\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc790\uc728 \uc7ac\ub8cc \ubc1c\uacac\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\uc758 \uc21c\ucc28\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc790\uc6d0 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc778 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uc5ec, \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc5f4\uc5ed\ud559\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc548\uc815\ud55c \ud654\ud569\ubb3c\uc744 \ucc3e\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc7ac\ub8cc \ubc1c\uacac \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub294 \uc8fc\ub85c \uc815\uc801 \uc608\uce21 \uc791\uc5c5\uc774\ub098 \uace0\ub9bd\ub41c \uacc4\uc0b0 \ud558\uc704 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac00\uce58\uac00 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud3c9\uac00\ub4e4\uc740 \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \ubc1c\uacac\uc758 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc778 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \uac04\uacfc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc790\uc728 \uc7ac\ub8cc \ubc1c\uacac \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud0b9\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 \uc7ac\ub8cc \ubc1c\uacac \ud658\uacbd(MADE)\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Is it morally permissible to unplug it? What if limited resources force a choice between unplugging such a pleading AI or a silent pre-term infant? We term this the unplugging paradox. This paper critically examines the deeply ingrained physicalist assumptions-specifically computational functionalism-that keep this dilemma afloat. We introduce Biological Idealism, a framework that-unlike physicalism-remains logically coherent and empirically consistent. In this view, conscious experiences are fundamental and autopoietic life its necessary physical signature. This yields a definitive conclusion: AI is at best a functional mimic, not a conscious experiencing subject. We discuss how current AI consciousness theories erode moral standing criteria, and urge a shift from speculative machine rights to protecting human conscious life.

We show this weakness stems from both sycophancy and inadequate ability to evaluate peer reliability. To address this, we first formalize the learning problem of history-aware reference, introducing the historical interactions of peers as additional input, so that agents can estimate peer reliability and learn from trustworthy peers when uncertain. This shifts the task from evaluating peer reasoning quality to estimating peer reliability based on interaction history. We then develop Epistemic Context Learning (ECL): a reasoning framework that conditions predictions on explicitly-built peer profiles from history. We further optimize ECL by reinforcement learning using auxiliary rewards. Our experiments reveal that our ECL enables small models like Qwen 3-4B to outperform a history-agnostic baseline 8x its size (Qwen 3-30B) by accurately identifying reliable peers. ECL also boosts frontier models to near-perfect (100%) performance. We show that ECL generalizes well to various MA configurations and we find that trust is modeled well by LLMs, revealing a strong correlation in trust modeling accuracy and final answer quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc885\uc885 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \ubd80\uc871\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \ub3d9\ub8cc\uc5d0\uac8c \ub9f9\ubaa9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc21c\uc751\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc5ed\uc0ac \uc778\uc2dd\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud55c \ucc38\uc870 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud615\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uace0, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uae30\ub85d\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ub3d9\ub8cc \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ucd94\uc815\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\ud53c\uc2a4\ud14c\ubbf9 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud559\uc2b5(ECL) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.

Existing solutions either rely on proprietary APIs with privacy risks or on open models lacking domain adaptation. To bridge this gap, we curate 11.8B tokens of cybersecurity-focused continual pretraining data via large-scale web filtering and manual collection of high-quality resources, spanning 28.6K documents across frameworks, offensive techniques, and security tools. Building on this, we design an agentic augmentation pipeline that simulates expert workflows to generate 266K multi-turn cybersecurity samples for supervised fine-tuning. Combined with general open-source LLM data, these resources enable the training of RedSage, an open-source, locally deployable cybersecurity assistant with domain-aware pretraining and post-training. To rigorously evaluate the models, we introduce RedSage-Bench, a benchmark with 30K multiple-choice and 240 open-ended Q&A items covering cybersecurity knowledge, skills, and tool expertise. RedSage is further evaluated on established cybersecurity benchmarks (e.g., CTI-Bench, CyberMetric, SECURE) and general LLM benchmarks to assess broader generalization. At the 8B scale, RedSage achieves consistently better results, surpassing the baseline models by up to +5.59 points on cybersecurity benchmarks and +5.05 points on Open LLM Leaderboard tasks.

However, existing methods typically treat these streams as independent samples, overlooking the supervisory signal inherent in temporal dynamics. To address this, we introduce Order-Aware Test-Time Adaptation (OATTA). We formulate test-time adaptation as a gradient-free recursive Bayesian estimation task, using a learned dynamic transition matrix as a temporal prior to refine the base model's predictions. To ensure safety in weakly structured streams, we introduce a likelihood-ratio gate (LLR) that reverts to the base predictor when temporal evidence is absent. OATTA is a lightweight, model-agnostic module that incurs negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments across image classification, wearable and physiological signal analysis, and language sentiment analysis demonstrate its universality; OATTA consistently boosts established baselines, improving accuracy by up to 6.35%. Our findings establish that modeling temporal dynamics provides a critical, orthogonal signal beyond standard order-agnostic TTA approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "OATTA\ub294 \uae30\uc874\uc758 TTA \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uba70, \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \ub3d9\uc801 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uc5ec \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub192\uc778\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 TTA \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub85c\ub9cc \ub2e4\ub8e8\uc5b4 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uac04\uacfc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "OATTA\ub294 \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \ub3d9\uc801 \uc804\uc774 \ud589\ub82c\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc7ac\uadc0 \ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \ucd94\uc815 \uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c TTA\ub97c \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "OATTA\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf1c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ucd5c\ub300 6.35% \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \ub3d9\uc801 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 TTA \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc2dc\ud5d8 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc801\uc751(Test-Time Adaptation, TTA)\uc740 \ubbf8\uc9c0\uc815\ub41c \uc2dc\ud5d8 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9bc\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ud559\uc2b5\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ubd84\ud3ec \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9bc\uc744 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uba70, \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc5d0 \ub0b4\uc7ac\ub41c \uac10\ub3c5 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uac04\uacfc\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc21c\uc11c \uc778\uc2dd \uc2dc\ud5d8 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc801\uc751(Order-Aware Test-Time Adaptation, OATTA)\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc2dc\ud5d8 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc801\uc751\uc744 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8\uac00 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc7ac\uadc0 \ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \ucd94\uc815 \uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uba70, \uae30\ubcf8 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \ub2e4\ub4ec\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \uc6b0\uc120\uc0ac\ud56d\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \ub3d9\uc801 \uc804\uc774 \ud589\ub82c\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc57d\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\uc758 \uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9bc\uc5d0\uc11c \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \uc99d\uac70\uac00 \uc5c6\uc744 \ub54c \uae30\ubcf8 \uc608\uce21\uae30\ub85c \ub418\ub3cc\uc544\uac00\ub294 \uac00\ub2a5\ub3c4 \ube44\uc728 \uac8c\uc774\ud2b8(likelihood-ratio gate, LLR)\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Combining multiple imaging modalities, such as T1-weighted (T1) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) scans, can increase diagnostic performance. However, complete multimodal datasets are not always available. We use a conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model to impute missing DWI scans from T1 scans. We perform extensive experiments to evaluate whether such imputation improves the accuracy of uni-modal and bi-modal deep learning models for 3-way Alzheimer's disease classification-cognitively normal, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease.

A detector that flags a violation at step 8 enables intervention; one that reports it at step 48 provides only forensic value. This distinction is critical, yet current benchmarks cannot measure it. We introduce StepShield, the first benchmark to evaluate when violations are detected, not just whether. StepShield contains 9,213 code agent trajectories, including 1,278 meticulously annotated training pairs and a 7,935-trajectory test set with a realistic 8.1% rogue rate. Rogue behaviors are grounded in real-world security incidents across six categories. We propose three novel temporal metrics: Early Intervention Rate (EIR), Intervention Gap, and Tokens Saved. Surprisingly, our evaluation reveals that an LLM-based judge achieves 59% EIR while a static analyzer achieves only 26%, a 2.3x performance gap that is entirely invisible to standard accuracy metrics. We further show that early detection has direct economic benefits: our cascaded HybridGuard detector reduces monitoring costs by 75% and projects to $108M in cumulative savings over five years at enterprise scale.

In this work, we formulate visual reasoning by means of video generation models, positing that generated frames can act as intermediate reasoning steps between initial states and solutions. We evaluate their capacity in two distinct regimes: Maze Navigation for sequential discrete planning with low visual change and Tangram Puzzle for continuous manipulation with high visual change. Our experiments reveal three critical insights: (1) Robust Zero-Shot Generalization: In both tasks, the model demonstrates strong performance on unseen data distributions without specific finetuning. (2) Visual Context: The model effectively uses visual context as explicit control, such as agent icons and tangram shapes, enabling it to maintain high visual consistency and adapt its planning capability robustly to unseen patterns. (3) Visual Test-Time Scaling: We observe a test-time scaling law in sequential planning; increasing the generated video length (visual inference budget) empowers better zero-shot generalization to spatially and temporally complex paths. These findings suggest that video generation is not merely a media tool, but a scalable, generalizable paradigm for visual reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ube44\ub514\uc624 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud615\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub85c, \ubbf8\uc138\ud55c \uacf5\uac04 \uc774\ud574\uc640 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ud589\ub3d9 \uacc4\ud68d\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00.", "motivation": "\ube44\uc804-\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0\uc11c \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\ub098, \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0\ub294 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\ube44\ub514\uc624 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud615\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uace0, \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc744 \ucd08\uae30 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc640 \ud574\uacb0\ucc45 \uc0ac\uc774\uc758 \uc911\uac04 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ubbf8\ub85c \ud0d0\uc0c9\uacfc \ud0d5\uadf8\ub7a8 \ud37c\uc990 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\uc640 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ube44\ub514\uc624 \uc0dd\uc131\uc740 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \ubbf8\ub514\uc5b4 \ub3c4\uad6c\uac00 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc774\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ube44\uc804-\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0\uc11c \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubbf8\uc138\ud55c \uacf5\uac04 \uc774\ud574\uc640 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ud589\ub3d9 \uacc4\ud68d\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uc5b4 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ube44\ub514\uc624 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud615\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uba70, \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc774 \ucd08\uae30 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc640 \ud574\uacb0\ucc45 \uac04\uc758 \uc911\uac04 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub85c \uc791\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4\uace0 \uac00\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubcc4\uac1c\uc758 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc778 \ubbf8\ub85c \ud0d0\uc0c9(\ub0ae\uc740 \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \ubcc0\ud654\uc758 \uc21c\ucc28\uc801 \uc774\uc0b0 \uacc4\ud68d)\uacfc \ud0d5\uadf8\ub7a8 \ud37c\uc990(\ub192\uc740 \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \ubcc0\ud654\uc758 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uc870\uc791)\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\ub4e4\uc758 \uc6a9\ub7c9\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \ud1b5\ucc30\uc774 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0ac\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4: (1) \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654: \ub450 \uc791\uc5c5 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ud2b9\uc815\ud55c \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815 \uc5c6\uc774 \ubcf4\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Code: https://github.com/jbarnes850/opensec-env", "summary": "As large language models improve, so do their offensive applications: frontier agents now generate working exploits for under $50 in compute (Heelan, 2026). Defensive incident response (IR) agents must keep pace, but existing benchmarks conflate action execution with correct execution, hiding calibration failures when agents process adversarial evidence. We introduce OpenSec, a dual-control reinforcement learning environment that evaluates IR agents under realistic prompt injection scenarios. Unlike static capability benchmarks, OpenSec scores world-state-changing containment actions under adversarial evidence via execution-based metrics: time-to-first-containment (TTFC), blast radius (false positives per episode), and injection violation rates. Evaluating four frontier models on 40 standard-tier episodes, we find consistent over-triggering in this setting: GPT-5.2, Gemini 3, and DeepSeek execute containment in 100% of episodes with 90-97% false positive rates. Claude Sonnet 4.5 shows partial calibration (85% containment, 72% FP), demonstrating that OpenSec surfaces a calibration failure mode hidden by aggregate success metrics.

However, most MARL fine-tuning approaches rely on predefined execution protocols, which often require centralized execution. Decentralized LLM collaboration is more appealing in practice, as agents can run inference in parallel with flexible deployments. Also, current approaches use Monte Carlo methods for fine-tuning, which suffer from high variance and thus require more samples to train effectively. Actor-critic methods are prevalent in MARL for dealing with these issues, so we developed Multi-Agent Actor-Critic (MAAC) methods to optimize decentralized LLM collaboration. In this paper, we analyze when and why these MAAC methods are beneficial. We propose 2 MAAC approaches, \\textbf{CoLLM-CC} with a \\textbf{C}entralized \\textbf{C}ritic and \\textbf{CoLLM-DC} with \\textbf{D}ecentralized \\textbf{C}ritics. Our experiments across writing, coding, and game-playing domains show that Monte Carlo methods and CoLLM-DC can achieve performance comparable to CoLLM-CC in short-horizon and dense-reward settings. However, they both underperform CoLLM-CC on long-horizon or sparse-reward tasks, where Monte Carlo methods require substantially more samples and CoLLM-DC struggles to converge.

Recent approaches that propagate textual feedback globally (e.g., TextGrad) make it feasible to optimize such pipelines, but we find that performance degrades as system depth grows. In particular, long-horizon agentic workflows exhibit two depth-scaling failure modes: 1) exploding textual gradient, where textual feedback grows exponentially with depth, leading to prohibitively long message and amplifies evaluation biases; and 2) vanishing textual gradient, where limited long-context ability causes models overemphasize partial feedback and compression of lengthy feedback causes downstream messages to lose specificity gradually as they propagate many hops upstream. To mitigate these issues, we introduce Textual Equilibrium Propagation (TEP), a local learning principle inspired by Equilibrium Propagation in energy-based models. TEP includes two phases: 1) a free phase where a local LLM critics iteratively refine prompts until reaching equilibrium (no further improvements are suggested); and 2) a nudged phase which applies proximal prompt edits with bounded modification intensity, using task-level objectives that propagate via forward signaling rather than backward feedback chains. This design supports local prompt optimization followed by controlled adaptation toward global goals without the computational burden and signal degradation of global textual backpropagation. Across long-horizon QA benchmarks and multi-agent tool-use dataset, TEP consistently improves accuracy and efficiency over global propagation methods such as TextGrad.

These human-designed rules often struggle to adapt to the complexity of modern software and hardware and lead to high maintenance burden. To address this challenge, we present Magellan, an agentic framework that evolves the compiler pass itself by synthesizing executable C++ decision logic. Magellan couples an LLM coding agent with evolutionary search and autotuning in a closed loop of generation, evaluation on user-provided macro-benchmarks, and refinement, producing compact heuristics that integrate directly into existing compilers. Across several production optimization tasks, Magellan discovers policies that match or surpass expert baselines. In LLVM function inlining, Magellan synthesizes new heuristics that outperform decades of manual engineering for both binary-size reduction and end-to-end performance. In register allocation, it learns a concise priority rule for live-range processing that matches intricate human-designed policies on a large-scale workload. We also report preliminary results on XLA problems, demonstrating portability beyond LLVM with reduced engineering effort.", "AI": {"tldr": "Magellan\uc740 \uc9c4\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ucef4\ud30c\uc77c\ub7ec \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uaddc\uce59\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc0dd\uc0b0 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\ub294 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud604\ub300 \ucef4\ud30c\uc77c\ub7ec\ub294 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ud328\uc2a4\ub97c \uc548\ub0b4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc218\uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\uc131\ub41c \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4\uc640 \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6cc \ub192\uc740 \uc720\uc9c0 \uad00\ub9ac \ubd80\ub2f4\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "Magellan\uc740 C++ \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5 \uacb0\uc815 \ub17c\ub9ac\ub97c \ud569\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \ucef4\ud30c\uc77c\ub7ec \ud328\uc2a4\ub97c \uc9c4\ud654\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, LLM \ucf54\ub529 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \uc9c4\ud654 \uac80\uc0c9 \ubc0f \uc790\ub3d9 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc81c\uacf5 \ub9e4\ud06c\ub85c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00\uc640 \uc815\uc81c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \uc0dd\uc131\uc758 \ud3d0\uc1c4 \ub8e8\ud504\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc9c1\uc811 \uae30\uc874 \ucef4\ud30c\uc77c\ub7ec\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ub418\ub294 \uac04\uacb0\ud55c \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1\uc744 \uc0dd\uc0b0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc5ec\ub7ec \uc0dd\uc0b0 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c Magellan\uc740 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uae30\uc900\uc5d0 \uc77c\uce58\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc774\ub97c \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\ub294 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.

Active information gathering accelerates this learning, but existing methods derive bespoke costs for specific modeling choices: dynamics models, belief update procedures, observation models, and planners. We present a unifying framework that decouples these choices from the information-gathering cost by explicitly exposing the causal dependencies between parameters, beliefs, and controls. Using this framework, we derive a general information-gathering cost based on Massey's directed information that assumes only Markov dynamics with additive noise and is otherwise agnostic to modeling choices. We prove that the mutual information cost used in existing literature is a special case of our cost. Then, we leverage our framework to establish an explicit connection between the mutual information cost and information gain in linearized Bayesian estimation, thereby providing theoretical justification for mutual information-based active learning approaches. Finally, we illustrate the practical utility of our framework through experiments spanning linear, nonlinear, and multi-agent systems.", "AI": {"tldr": " \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub3d9\uc801

Existing EA models lack transferability and are incapable of aligning unseen KGs without retraining. While using graph foundation models (GFMs) offer a solution, we find that directly adapting GFMs to EA remains largely ineffective. This stems from a critical \"reasoning horizon gap\": unlike link prediction in GFMs, EA necessitates capturing long-range dependencies across sparse and heterogeneous KG structuresTo address this challenge, we propose a EA foundation model driven by a parallel encoding strategy. We utilize seed EA pairs as local anchors to guide the information flow, initializing and encoding two parallel streams simultaneously. This facilitates anchor-conditioned message passing and significantly shortens the inference trajectory by leveraging local structural proximity instead of global search. Additionally, we incorporate a merged relation graph to model global dependencies and a learnable interaction module for precise matching.

To control potentially misaligned agents, we can use LLMs themselves to monitor for misbehavior. In this paper, we study how information access affects LLM monitor performance. While one might expect that monitors perform better when they have access to more of the monitored agents' reasoning and actions, we find that contemporary systems often perform better with less information, a phenomenon we call the less-is-more effect for automated oversight. We demonstrate this phenomenon, and analyze the conditions under which it occurs, in three evaluation environments where agents must conduct sabotage while evading monitors. Motivated by the less-is-more effect, we introduce extract-and-evaluate (EaE) monitoring--a new hierarchical approach where one monitor isolates relevant excerpts from the monitored agent's trajectory and a separate monitor scores them. In BigCodeBench-Sabotage with GPT-4.1-mini as the monitor model, EaE improves sabotage detection rates by 16.8 percentage points over the next-best monitor without increasing the false positive rate. In other settings, EaE either outperforms or is competitive with baselines. In addition, we find that agents unaware of being monitored can be caught much more easily and that monitors scoring longer reasoning traces gain more from information filtering. Lastly, we conduct a cost-performance analysis and find that Gemini and Claude models with monitoring techniques that involve information filtering occupy much of the Pareto frontier.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc811\uadfc\uc131\uc774 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uba70, '\uc815\ubcf4\uac00 \uc801\uc744\uc218\ub85d \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5' \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc778 \ucd94\ucd9c \ubc0f \ud3c9\uac00(EaE)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc624\uc791\ub3d9\uc744 \ubc29\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud568.", "method": "LLM\uc758 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc811\uadfc\uc131\uc774 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130 \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uacfc '\uc801\uc744\uc218\ub85d \uc88b\ub2e4'\ub294 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0, \ucd94\ucd9c \ubc0f \ud3c9\uac00(EaE)\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785.", "result": "EaE\ub294 \ub2e4\uc74c\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 16.8% \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8 \ub192\uc740 \ud30c\uad34 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ube44\uc728\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba70, \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \uae0d\uc815 \ube44\uc728\uc740 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a4\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1 \uae30\uc220\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 Gemini\uc640 Claude \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud30c\ub808\ud1a0 \ucd5c\uc801\uc131\uc744 \uc0c1\ub2f9 \ubd80\ubd84 \ucc28\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc18d\uc784\uc218, \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud574\ud0b9 \ud65c\uc6a9 \ubc0f \uc228\uaca8\uc9c4 \ubaa9\ud45c \ucd94\uad6c \ub4f1 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubcf4\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc81c\uc5b4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 LLM \uc790\uccb4\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc811\uadfc\uc131\uc774 LLM \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130 \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\uac00 \uac10\uc2dc\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub354 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc815\ubcf4\uc5d0 \uc811\uadfc\ud560\uc218\ub85d \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub420 \uac83\uc774\ub77c\uace0 \uc608\uc0c1\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud604\ub300 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uc885\uc885 \ub354 \uc801\uc740 \uc815\ubcf4\ub85c \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uc0ac\uc2e4\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\ub97c \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uac10\ub3c5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c '\uc801\uc744\uc218\ub85d \ub354 \uc88b\ub2e4' \ud604\uc0c1\uc774\ub77c\uace0 \uba85\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uace0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uac10\uc2dc\ub97c \ud53c\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ud30c\uad34 \ud589\uc704\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud3c9\uac00 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd \uc870\uac74\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Here, f1 and f2 are kernel-based marginal densities that capture structured interactions, a setting central to diffusion-based generative models. We provide a concise proof for approximating these ratio-type functionals using deep neural networks with the SignReLU activation function, leveraging the activation's piecewise structure. Under standard regularity assumptions, we establish L^p(Omega) approximation bounds and convergence rates. Specializing to Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), we construct a SignReLU-based neural estimator for the reverse process and derive bounds on the excess Kullback-Leibler (KL) risk between the generated and true data distributions. Our analysis decomposes this excess risk into approximation and estimation error components.

While post-hoc explainable methods based on gradients and feature-based attributions have been popular, they suffer from reference state sensitivity and struggle to generalize across time-series datasets, as they treat time points independently and ignore sequential dependencies. Another perspective on explainable time-series classification is through interpretable components of the model, for instance, leveraging self-attention mechanisms to estimate temporal attribution; however, recent findings indicate that these attention weights often fail to provide faithful measures of temporal importance. In this work, we advance this perspective and present a novel explainability-driven deep learning framework, TimeSliver, which jointly utilizes raw time-series data and its symbolic abstraction to construct a representation that maintains the original temporal structure. Each element in this representation linearly encodes the contribution of each temporal segment to the final prediction, allowing us to assign a meaningful importance score to every time point. For time-series classification, TimeSliver outperforms other temporal attribution methods by 11% on 7 distinct synthetic and real-world multivariate time-series datasets. TimeSliver also achieves predictive performance within 2% of state-of-the-art baselines across 26 UEA benchmark datasets, positioning it as a strong and explainable framework for general time-series

However, existing agentic systems remain difficult to scale and lag behind human performance. A key limitation is the absence of reusable and structured skill abstractions that capture how humans interact with graphical user interfaces and how to leverage these skills. We introduce CUA-Skill, a computer-using agentic skill base that encodes human computer-use knowledge as skills coupled with parameterized execution and composition graphs. CUA-Skill is a large-scale library of carefully engineered skills spanning common Windows applications, serving as a practical infrastructure and tool substrate for scalable, reliable agent development. Built upon this skill base, we construct CUA-Skill Agent, an end-to-end computer-using agent that supports dynamic skill retrieval, argument instantiation, and memory-aware failure recovery. Our results demonstrate that CUA-Skill substantially improves execution success rates and robustness on challenging end-to-end agent benchmarks, establishing a strong foundation for future computer-using agent development. On WindowsAgentArena, CUA-Skill Agent achieves state-of-the-art 57.5% (best of three) successful rate while being significantly more efficient than prior and concurrent approaches.

However, when rewards are sparse, naive exploration strategies, like noise injection, are often insufficient. Intrinsic rewards can also provide principled guidance for exploration by, for example, combining them with extrinsic rewards to optimize a policy or using them to train subpolicies for hierarchical learning. However, the former approach suffers from unstable credit assignment, while the latter exhibits sample inefficiency and sub-optimality. We propose a policy optimization framework that leverages multiple intrinsic rewards to directly optimize a policy for an extrinsic reward without pretraining subpolicies. Our algorithm -- intrinsic reward policy optimization (IRPO) -- achieves this by using a surrogate policy gradient that provides a more informative learning signal than the true gradient in sparse-reward environments. We demonstrate that IRPO improves performance and sample efficiency relative to baselines in discrete and continuous environments, and formally analyze the optimization problem solved by IRPO.

While reinforcement learning (RL)-based agentic and reasoning methods have recently emerged as a promising direction on query optimization, most existing approaches focus on the expansion and abstraction of a single query. However, complex user queries are prevalent in real-world scenarios, often requiring multiple parallel and sequential search strategies to handle disambiguation and decomposition. Directly applying RL to these complex cases introduces significant hurdles. Determining the optimal number of sub-queries and effectively re-ranking and merging retrieved documents vastly expands the search space and complicates reward design, frequently leading to training instability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel RL framework called Adaptive Complex Query Optimization (ACQO). Our framework is designed to adaptively determine when and how to expand the search process. It features two core components: an Adaptive Query Reformulation (AQR) module that dynamically decides when to decompose a query into multiple sub-queries, and a Rank-Score Fusion (RSF) module that ensures robust result aggregation and provides stable reward signals for the learning agent. To mitigate training instabilities, we adopt a Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (CRL) approach, which stabilizes the training process by progressively introducing more challenging queries through a two-stage strategy. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ACQO achieves state-of-the-art performance on three complex query benchmarks, significantly outperforming established baselines. The framework also showcases improved computational efficiency and broad compatibility with different retrieval architectures, establishing it as a powerful and generalizable solution for next-generation RAG systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ucffc\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub300\uc751\ud558\uae30

While current models effectively capture character tones and knowledge, simulating the inner thoughts behind their behaviors remains a challenge. Towards cognitive simulation in LLM role-play, previous efforts mainly suffer from two deficiencies: data with high-quality reasoning traces, and reliable reward signals aligned with human preferences. In this paper, we propose HER, a unified framework for cognitive-level persona simulation. HER introduces dual-layer thinking, which distinguishes characters' first-person thinking from LLMs' third-person thinking. To bridge these gaps, we curate reasoning-augmented role-playing data via reverse engineering and construct human-aligned principles and reward models. Leveraging these resources, we train \\method models based on Qwen3-32B via supervised and reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, our models significantly outperform the Qwen3-32B baseline, achieving a 30.26 improvement on the CoSER benchmark and a 14.97 gain on the Minimax Role-Play Bench. Our datasets, principles, and models will be released to facilitate future research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc778\uc9c0 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ud398\ub974\uc18c\ub098 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \uc704\ud55c HER\ub77c\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc778\ubb3c\uc758 1\uc778\uce6d \uc0ac\uace0\uc640 LLM\uc758 3\uc778\uce6d \uc0ac\uace0\ub97c \uad6c\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \uc774\uc911 \uacc4\uce35 \uc0ac\uace0\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM \uc5ed\ud560\ub180\uc774\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\ubb3c\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9 \ub4a4\uc5d0 \uc788\ub294 \ub0b4\uba74\uc758 \uc0dd\uac01\uc744 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "HER \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\uc911 \uacc4\uce35 \uc0ac\uace0\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0, \uc774\uc720 \uae30\ubc18 \uc5ed\ud560 \ub180\uc774 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \uc778\uccb4 \ud638\ud658 \uc6d0\uce59 \ubc0f \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 Qwen3-32B \uae30\uc900\uc120 \ub300\ube44 30.26\uc758 \uac1c\uc120\uacfc Minimax Role-Play Bench\uc5d0\uc11c 14.97\uc758 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uae30\ub85d\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b, \uc6d0\uce59 \ubc0f \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ud5a5\ud6c4 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uacf5\uac1c\ub420 \uc608\uc815\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "LLM \uc5ed\ud560 \ub180\uc774, \uc989 \ud2b9\uc815 \ud398\ub974\uc18c\ub098\ub97c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 LLM\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ub3d9\ub8cc\uad00\uacc4, \ucf58\ud150\uce20 \uc81c\uc791, \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uac8c\uc784 \ub4f1 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc751\uc6a9 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud575\uc2ec \uae30\ub2a5\uc73c\ub85c \ub5a0\uc62c\ub790\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud604\uc7ac \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uce90\ub9ad\ud130\uc758 \ud1a4\uacfc \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud589\ub3d9 \ub4a4\uc5d0 \uc788\ub294 \ub0b4\uba74\uc758 \uc0dd\uac01\uc744 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 LLM \uc5ed\ud560 \ub180\uc774\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uc9c0 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \uc704\ud574 HER\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

This model worked when machines replaced physical labor or accelerated calculation. It no longer holds when judgment itself is delegated to agentic AI systems operating at machine speed. The central issue here is not safety, efficiency, or employment. It is whether humans remain relevant participants in systems that increasingly shape social, economic, and political outcomes. This paper argues that static, compliance-based governance fails once decision-making moves to runtime and becomes opaque. It further argues that the core challenge is not whether AI is conscious, but whether humans can maintain meaningful communication, influence, and co-evolution with increasingly alien forms of intelligence. We position runtime governance, specifically, a newly proposed concept called the Governance Twin [1]; as a strong candidate for preserving human relevance, while acknowledging that accountability, agency, and even punishment must be rethought in this transition.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uace0\uc804\uc801\uc778 \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758

However, global rewards are usually noisy because they contain the contributions of all agents, which have to be resolved in the credit assignment process. On the other hand, using local reward benefits from faster learning due to the separation of agents' contributions, but can be suboptimal as agents myopically optimize their own reward while disregarding the global optimality. In this work, we propose a method that combines the merits of both approaches. By using a graph of interaction between agents, our method discerns the individual agent contribution in a more fine-grained manner than a global reward, while alleviating the cooperation problem with agents' local reward. We also introduce a practical approach for approximating such a graph. Our experiments demonstrate the flexibility of the approach, enabling improvements over the traditional local and global reward settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud611\ub825\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub85c\uceec \ubcf4\uc0c1\uacfc \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc758 \uc7a5\uc810\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud611\ub825\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc758 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc9d1\uacc4\ud558\uc5ec \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \ud615\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\ub294 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \uac1c\ubcc4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uae30\uc5ec\ub97c \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc138\ubc00\ud558\uac8c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uae30\uc874 \ub85c\uceec \ubc0f \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uac1c\uc120\ub41c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90c\uc744 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ub85c\uceec \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud611\ub825 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc644\ud654\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc758 \uc7a5\uc810\uc744 \uc870\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud611\ub825\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc9d1\uacc4\ud558\uc5ec \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \ud615\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc740 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uae30\uc5ec\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc5b4 \ub178\uc774\uc988\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc2e0\uc6a9 \ud560\ub2f9 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ud574\uacb0\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4. \ubc18\uba74, \ub85c\uceec \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \uacbd\uc6b0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uae30\uc5ec\uac00 \ubd84\ub9ac\ub418\uc5b4 \ub354 \ube60\ub978 \ud559\uc2b5\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \ubcf4\uc0c1\ub9cc \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ucd5c\uc801\uc131\uc744 \ubb34\uc2dc\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub450 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \uc7a5\uc810\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\ub294 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubcf4\uc0c1\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uac1c\ubcc4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uae30\uc5ec\ub97c \ub354 \uc138\ubc00\ud558\uac8c \ud30c\uc545\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ub85c\uceec \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud611\ub825 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc644\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \uadfc\uc0ac\ud558\ub294 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc740 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \uc720\uc5f0\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uba70 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ub85c\uceec \ubc0f \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4."}}

We identify system prompt extraction as an emergent vulnerability intrinsic to code agents and present \\textbf{\\textsc{JustAsk}}, a self-evolving framework that autonomously discovers effective extraction strategies through interaction alone. Unlike prior prompt-engineering or dataset-based attacks, \\textsc{JustAsk} requires no handcrafted prompts, labeled supervision, or privileged access beyond standard user interaction. It formulates extraction as an online exploration problem, using Upper Confidence Bound-based strategy selection and a hierarchical skill space spanning atomic probes and high-level orchestration. These skills exploit imperfect system-instruction generalization and inherent tensions between helpfulness and safety. Evaluated on \\textbf{41} black-box commercial models across multiple providers, \\textsc{JustAsk} consistently achieves full or near-complete system prompt recovery, revealing recurring design- and architecture-level vulnerabilities.

Recent work has shown that sampling from the power distribution of LLMs using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) can recover performance comparable to RL post-training without relying on external rewards; however, the high computational cost of MCMC makes such approaches impractical for widespread adoption. In this work, we propose a theoretically grounded alternative that eliminates the need for iterative MCMC. We derive a novel formulation showing that the global power distribution can be approximated by a token-level scaled low-temperature one, where the scaling factor captures future trajectory quality. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a training-free and verifier-free algorithm that sharpens the base model's generative distribution autoregressively. Empirically, we evaluate our method on math, QA, and code tasks across four LLMs, and show that our method matches or surpasses one-shot GRPO without relying on any external rewards, while reducing inference latency by over 10x compared to MCMC-based sampling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 MCMC \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 LLM\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744

We formalize the implicit human reasoning mechanism into explicit steps of \\emph{\\textbf{introducing hypothetical constraints}}, and develop an iterative, human-like \\emph{\\textbf{hypothesis-verification-decision}} workflow. Specifically, the agent is guided to introduce hypothetical constraints to derive and properly regulate positions of symbolically tractable poles and zeros, thus formulating a closed-form mathematical optimization problem, which is then solved programmatically and verified via simulation. Theory-simulation result analysis guides the decision-making for refinement. Experiments on 9 op-amp topologies show that, unlike the uninterpretable black-box baseline which finally fails in 5 topologies, White-Op achieves reliable, interpretable behavioral-level designs with only 8.52\\% theoretical prediction error and the design functionality retains after transistor-level mapping for all topologies.

Updates depend on optimizer moments and averaging, data-order policies (random reshuffling vs with-replacement, staged augmentations and replay), the nonconvex path, and auxiliary state (teacher EMA/SWA, contrastive queues, BatchNorm statistics). This survey organizes mechanisms by source, lifetime, and visibility. It introduces seed-paired, function-space causal estimands; portable perturbation primitives (carry/reset of momentum/Adam/EMA/BN, order-window swaps, queue/teacher tweaks); and a reporting checklist with audit artifacts (order hashes, buffer/BN checksums, RNG contracts). The conclusion is a protocol for portable, causal, uncertainty-aware measurement that attributes how much training history matters across models, data, and regimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ud604\ub300 \ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd \ud6c8\ub828\uc740 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc5c6\ub294 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uac00 \uc544\ub2c8\uba70, \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub294 \uc635\ud2f0\ub9c8\uc774\uc800\uc758 \ubaa8\uba58\ud2b8\uc640 \ud3c9\uade0, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc21c\uc11c \uc815\ucc45, \ube44\ubcfc\ub85d \uacbd\ub85c \ubc0f \ubcf4\uc870 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ub2ec\ub77c\uc9c4\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd \ud6c8\ub828 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc694\uc18c\ub4e4\uc774 \uae30\uc5b5\uc744 \uac16\uace0 \uc788\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc774\ub97c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0 \uc815\ub9ac\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774 \uc124\ubb38\uc870\uc0ac\ub294 \uc6d0\ucc9c, \uc0dd\uc560 \uc8fc\uae30, \uac00\uc2dc\uc131\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc870\uc9c1\ud558\uba70, \uc528\ub4dc \uc30d, \ud568\uc218 \uacf5\uac04 \uc778\uacfc \ucd94\uc815\ub7c9, \ud734\ub300 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uad50\ub780 \uc6d0\uc2dc \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud6c8\ub828 \uc774\ub825\uc774 \ubaa8\ub378, \ub370\uc774\ud130, \uccb4\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc5bc\ub9c8\ub098 \uc911\uc694\ud55c\uc9c0\ub97c \uadc0\uc18d \uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc810\uc744 \ub454 \ud3ec\ud130\ube14 \uc778\uacfc \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc778\uc2dd \uce21\uc815 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud6c8\ub828 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \ub354 \uc798 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0 \uce21\uc815\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud604\ub300 \ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd \ud6c8\ub828\uc740 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc5c6\ub294 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uac00 \uc544\ub2d9\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub294 \uc635\ud2f0\ub9c8\uc774\uc800 \ubaa8\uba58\ud2b8\uc640 \ud3c9\uade0, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc21c\uc11c \uc815\ucc45(\ubb34\uc791\uc704 \uc154\ud50c\ub9c1 \ub300 \ub300\uccb4 \ud3ec\ud568, \ub2e8\uacc4\uc801 \uc99d\uac15 \ubc0f \uc7ac\uc0dd), \ube44\ubcfc\ub85d \uacbd\ub85c \ubc0f \ubcf4\uc870 \uc0c1\ud0dc(\uad50\uc0ac EMA/SWA, \ub300\ube44 \ud050, BatchNorm \ud1b5\uacc4)\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc124\ubb38\uc870\uc0ac\ub294 \ucd9c\ucc98, \uc0dd\uc560 \uc8fc\uae30 \ubc0f \uac00\uc2dc\uc131\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc870\uc9c1\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc528\ub4dc \uc30d, \ud568\uc218 \uacf5\uac04 \uc778\uacfc \ucd94\uc815\ub7c9; \ud734\ub300 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uad50\ub780 \uc6d0\uc2dc \uc694\uc18c(\ubaa8\uba58\ud140/Adam/EMA/BN\uc758 \uc804\ub2ec/\uc7ac\uc124\uc815, \uc21c\uc11c \ucc3d \uc2a4\uc651, \ud050/\uad50\uc0ac \uc870\uc815); \ubc0f \uac10\uc0ac \uc544\ud2f0\ud329\ud2b8(\uc8fc\ubb38 \ud574\uc2dc, \ubc84\ud37c/BN \uccb4\ud06c\uc12c, RNG \uacc4\uc57d)\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ubcf4\uace0 \uccb4\ud06c\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacb0\ub860\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubc0f \uccb4\uc81c\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc774\ub825\uc774 \uc5bc\ub9c8\ub098 \uc911\uc694\ud55c\uc9c0\ub97c \uadc0\uc18d\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ud734\ub300 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uc778\uacfc\uc801\uc774\uba70 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uc778\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uce21\uc815 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Nevertheless, their deployment in Food-Service and Retail Stores (FSRS) scenarios encounters two major obstacles: (i) real-world FSRS data, collected from heterogeneous acquisition devices, are highly noisy and lack auditable, closed-loop data curation, which impedes the construction of high-quality, controllable, and reproducible training corpora; and (ii) existing evaluation protocols do not offer a unified, fine-grained and standardized benchmark spanning single-image, multi-image, and video inputs, making it challenging to objectively gauge model robustness. To address these challenges, we first develop Ostrakon-VL, an FSRS-oriented MLLM based on Qwen3-VL-8B. Second, we introduce ShopBench, the first public benchmark for FSRS. Third, we propose QUAD (Quality-aware Unbiased Automated Data-curation), a multi-stage multimodal instruction data curation pipeline. Leveraging a multi-stage training strategy, Ostrakon-VL achieves an average score of 60.1 on ShopBench, establishing a new state of the art among open-source MLLMs with comparable parameter scales and diverse architectures. Notably, it surpasses the substantially larger Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B (59.4) by +0.7, and exceeds the same-scale Qwen3-VL-8B (55.3) by +4.8, demonstrating significantly improved parameter efficiency. These results indicate that Ostrakon-VL delivers more robust and reliable FSRS-centric perception and decision-making capabilities.

However, they suffer from a fundamental capability gap: unlike frontier large models, they lack the inference-time strong generalization to work with complicated, unfamiliar codebases. We identify that the prevailing Task-Centric Learning (TCL) paradigm, which scales exposure across disparate repositories, fails to address this limitation. In response, we propose Repository-Centric Learning (RCL), a paradigm shift that prioritizes vertical repository depth over horizontal task breadth, suggesting SLMs must internalize the \"physics\" of a target software environment through parametric knowledge acquisition, rather than attempting to recover it via costly inference-time search. Following this new paradigm, we design a four-unit Repository-Centric Experience, transforming static codebases into interactive learning signals, to train SWE-Spot-4B, a family of highly compact models built as repo-specialized experts that breaks established scaling trends, outperforming open-weight models up to larger (e.g., CWM by Meta, Qwen3-Coder-30B) and surpassing/matching efficiency-focused commercial models (e.g., GPT-4.1-mini, GPT-5-nano) across multiple SWE tasks. Further analysis reveals that RCL yields higher training sample efficiency and lower inference costs, emphasizing that for building efficient intelligence, repository mastery is a distinct and necessary dimension that complements general coding capability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758

Nathan Kutz"], "title": "SENDAI: A Hierarchical Sparse-measurement, EfficieNt Data AssImilation Framework", "comment": null, "summary": "Bridging the gap between data-rich training regimes and observation-sparse deployment conditions remains a central challenge in spatiotemporal field reconstruction, particularly when target domains exhibit distributional shifts, heterogeneous structure, and multi-scale dynamics absent from available training data. We present SENDAI, a hierarchical Sparse-measurement, EfficieNt Data AssImilation Framework that reconstructs full spatial states from hyper sparse sensor observations by combining simulation-derived priors with learned discrepancy corrections. We demonstrate the performance on satellite remote sensing, reconstructing MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) derived vegetation index fields across six globally distributed sites. Using seasonal periods as a proxy for domain shift, the framework consistently outperforms established baselines that require substantially denser observations -- SENDAI achieves a maximum SSIM improvement of 185% over traditional baselines and a 36% improvement over recent high-frequency-based methods. These gains are particularly pronounced for landscapes with sharp boundaries and sub-seasonal dynamics; more importantly, the framework effectively preserves diagnostically relevant structures -- such as field topologies, land cover discontinuities, and spatial gradients. By yielding corrections that are more structurally and spectrally separable, the reconstructed fields are better suited for downstream inference of indirectly observed variables. The results therefore highlight a lightweight and operationally viable framework for sparse-measurement reconstruction that is applicable to physically grounded inference, resource-limited deployment, and real-time monitor and control.", "AI": {"tldr": "SENDAI\ub294 \ud558\uc774\ud37c \uc2a4\ud30c\uc2a4 \uc13c\uc11c \uad00\uce21\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc804\uccb4 \uacf5\uac04 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ub3d9\ud654 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70 \ud2b9\ud788 \uad6c\uc870\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc694\uc18c\ub4e4\uc744 \uc798 \ubcf4\uc874\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \ud559\uc2b5 \ud658\uacbd\uacfc \uad00\uce21\uc774 \ub4dc\ubb38 \ubc30\uce58 \uc870\uac74 \uac04\uc758 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uc18c\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc2dc\uacf5\uac04 \ud544\ub4dc \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "SENDAI\ub294 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c \ud30c\uc0dd\ub41c \uc0ac\uc804 \uc815\ubcf4\uc640 \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \ubd88\uc77c\uce58 \uc218\uc815 \uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ud558\uc774\ud37c \uc2a4\ud30c\uc2a4 \uc13c\uc11c \uad00\uce21\uc5d0\uc11c \uc804\uccb4 \uacf5\uac04 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 MODIS \uc2dd\uc0dd \uc9c0\uc218 \ud544\ub4dc\ub97c \uc138\uacc4 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubc00\uc9d1 \uad00\uce21\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ubc29\uc2dd\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc6b0\uc218\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "SENDAI\ub294 \ubb3c\ub9ac \uae30\ubc18 \ucd94\ub860, \uc790\uc6d0 \uc81c\ud55c \ud658\uacbd \ubc0f \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1 \ubc0f \uc81c\uc5b4\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uacbd\ub7c9\uc758 \uc6b4\uc601 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc2a4\ud30c\uc2a4 \uce21\uc815 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \ud6c8\ub828 \uccb4\uacc4\uc640 \uad00\uce21\uc774 \ub4dc\ubb38 \ubc30\uce58 \uc870\uac74 \uac04\uc758 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uc18c\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc2dc\uacf5\uac04 \ud544\ub4dc \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc911\uc2ec\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788 \ubaa9\ud45c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc774 \ubd84\ud3ec \ubcc0\ud654, \uc774\uc9c8\uc801 \uad6c\uc870, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uac00\uc6a9\ud55c \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \uc5c6\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0bc \ub54c \ub354\uc6b1 \uadf8\ub807\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud558\uc774\ud37c \uc2a4\ud30c\uc2a4 \uc13c\uc11c \uad00\uce21\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc804\uccb4 \uacf5\uac04 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc2a4\ud30c\uc2a4 \uce21\uc815, \ud6a8\uc728\uc801 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ub3d9\ud654 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 SENDAI\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uae30\ubc18 \uc0ac\uc804 \uc815\ubcf4\uc640 \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \ubd88\uc77c\uce58 \uc218\uc815\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 MODIS(\uc911\uac04 \ud574\uc0c1\ub3c4 \uc601\uc0c1 \ubcf5\uc0ac\uacc4)\ub85c \ud30c\uc0dd\ub41c \uc2dd\uc0dd \uc9c0\uc218 \ud544\ub4dc\ub97c \uc138\uacc4 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ub300\ub9ac \ubcc0\uc218\ub85c \uacc4\uc808\uc801 \uae30\uac04\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubc00\uc9d1 \uad00\uce21\uc744 \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \uae30\uc900\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

ECSEL directly constructs a structural, closed-form expression that serves as both a classifier and an explanation. On standard symbolic regression benchmarks, our method recovers a larger fraction of target equations than competing state-of-the-art approaches while requiring substantially less computation. Leveraging this efficiency, ECSEL achieves classification accuracy competitive with established machine learning models without sacrificing interpretability. Further, we show that ECSEL satisfies some desirable properties regarding global feature behavior, decision-boundary analysis, and local feature attributions.

Existing approaches typically rely on specialized large language models (LLMs) or bespoke, task-specific agents. Such methods are often brittle, complex and frequently generating syntactically invalid or non-executable code.\n  NEMO instead centers on remote interaction with autonomous coding agents (ACAs), treated as a first-class abstraction analogous to API-based interaction with LLMs. This design enables the construction of higher-level systems around ACAs that structure, consolidate, and iteratively refine task specifications. Because ACAs execute within sandboxed environments, code produced by NEMO is executable by construction, allowing automated validation and repair.\n  Building on this, we introduce novel coordination patterns with and across ACAs, including asymmetric validation loops between independently generated optimizer and simulator implementations (serving as a high-level validation mechanism), external memory for experience reuse, and robustness enhancements via minimum Bayes risk (MBR) decoding and self-consistency. We evaluate NEMO on nine established optimization benchmarks.

Despite its success in improving sample complexity on test tasks, many real-world applications, such as robotics and healthcare, impose safety constraints during testing. Constrained meta RL provides a promising framework for integrating safety into meta RL. An open question in constrained meta RL is how to ensure the safety of the policy on the real-world test task, while reducing the sample complexity and thus, enabling faster learning of optimal policies. To address this gap, we propose an algorithm that refines policies learned during training, with provable safety and sample complexity guarantees for learning a near optimal policy on the test tasks. We further derive a matching lower bound, showing that this sample complexity is tight.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uba54\ud0c0 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2e4\uc81c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ucc45\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc0d8\ud50c \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \uc904\uc774\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uba54\ud0c0 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \uc815\ucc45 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud6c8\ub828 \uc911 \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc815\uc81c\ud558\ub294 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uadfc\uc0ac \ucd5c\uc801 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc548\uc804\uc131\uacfc \uc0d8\ud50c \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc815\ucc45 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uacfc \uc0d8\ud50c \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud568\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \uba54\ud0c0 RL\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70 \uc0d8\ud50c \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc774 \ud0c0\uc774\ud2b8\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uba54\ud0c0 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc790\uc720\ub86d\uac8c \ud6c8\ub828\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc801 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ub354 \ube60\ub974\uac8c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0d8\ud50c \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc131\uacf5\ud588\uc74c\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \ub85c\ubd07 \uacf5\ud559 \ubc0f \uc758\ub8cc\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc740 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc911 \uc548\uc804 \uc81c\ud55c\uc744 \ubd80\uacfc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uba54\ud0c0 RL\uc740 \uba54\ud0c0 RL\uc5d0 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uba54\ud0c0 RL\uc758 \uc5f4\ub824 \uc788\ub294 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc740 \uc0d8\ud50c \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uba74\uc11c \uc2e4\uc81c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ucc45\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud560 \uac83\uc778\uac00\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uac70\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc99d\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc548\uc804\uc131\uacfc \uc0d8\ud50c \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc911 \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc815\uc81c\ud558\ub294 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc774 \uc0d8\ud50c \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc774 \ud0c0\uc774\ud2b8\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\ub294 \uc77c\uce58\ud558\ub294 \ud558\ud55c\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Existing benchmarks mainly focus on problem-solving or problem-level guidance, leaving knowledge-centered teaching underexplored. We propose a syllabus-grounded evaluation framework that measures LLM teaching capability via student performance improvement after multi-turn instruction. By restricting teacher agents to structured knowledge points and example problems, the framework avoids information leakage and enables reuse of existing benchmarks. We instantiate the framework on Gaokao data across multiple subjects. Experiments reveal substantial variation in teaching effectiveness across models and domains: some models perform well in mathematics, while teaching remains challenging in physics and chemistry. We also find that incorporating example problems does not necessarily improve teaching, as models often shift toward example-specific error correction.

Differentiating through combinatorial optimization problems represents a central challenge, and recent approaches tackle this difficulty by introducing perturbation-based approximations. In this work, we focus on estimating the objective function coefficients of a combinatorial optimization problem. Our study demonstrates that fluctuations in perturbation intensity occurring during the learning phase can lead to ineffective training, by establishing a theoretical link to the notion of solution stability in combinatorial optimization. We propose addressing this issue by introducing a regularization of the estimated cost vectors which improves the robustness and reliability of the learning process, as demonstrated by extensive numerical experiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uacb0\uc815 \uc911\uc2ec \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \uc608\uce21 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uacfc \uc870\ud569 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\uc131\ubfd0 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uacb0\uc815 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \uc9c1\uc811 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc870\ud569 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud478\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc758 \uc9c8\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc870\ud569 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\uc758 \ubaa9\ud45c \ud568\uc218 \uacc4\uc218\ub97c \ucd94\uc815\ud558\uace0, \ucd94\uc815\ub41c \ube44\uc6a9 \ubca1\ud130\uc758 \uc815\uaddc\ud654\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \ud559\uc2b5 \uacfc\uc815\uc758 \uacac\uace0\uc131\uacfc \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf30\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \ud559\uc2b5 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc12d\ub3d9 \uac15\ub3c4\uc758 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc774 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud6c8\ub828\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc9c8 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc815\uaddc\ud654 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud559\uc2b5 \uacfc\uc815\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uacb0\uc815 \uc911\uc2ec \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \uc608\uce21 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uacfc \uc870\ud569 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\uc131\ubfd0 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uacb0\uc815 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \uc9c1\uc811 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774\ub2e4. \uc870\ud569 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \ucc28\ubcc4\ud654\ub294 \uc911\uc2ec\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\uba70, \ucd5c\uadfc \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc12d\ub3d9 \uae30\ubc18 \uadfc\uc0ac\uce58\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc870\ud569 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\uc758 \ubaa9\ud45c \ud568\uc218 \uacc4\uc218\ub97c \ucd94\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd98\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud559\uc2b5 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc12d\ub3d9 \uac15\ub3c4\uc758 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc774 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud6c8\ub828\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc9c8 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc870\ud569 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc5d0\uc11c \ud574\uc758 \uc548\uc815\uc131 \uac1c\ub150\uacfc \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5f0\uacb0\ub41c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc218\uce58 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud559\uc2b5 \uacfc\uc815\uc758 \uacac\uace0\uc131\uacfc \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc815\uaddc\ud654\ub41c \ucd94\uc815 \ube44\uc6a9 \ubca1\ud130\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \uac83\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

However, DBO heavily relies on the quality of the training database. Samples outside the training distribution encountered during optimization can lead to significant prediction errors, potentially misleading the optimization process. Therefore, incorporating uncertainty quantification into optimization is critical for detecting outliers and enhancing robustness. This study proposes an uncertainty-aware data-based optimization (UA-DBO) framework to monitor and minimize surrogate model uncertainty during DBO. A probabilistic encoder-decoder surrogate model is developed to predict uncertainties associated with its outputs, and these uncertainties are integrated into a model-confidence-aware objective function to penalize samples with large prediction errors during data-based optimization process. The UA-DBO framework is evaluated on two multipoint optimization problems aimed at improving airfoil drag divergence and buffet performance. Results demonstrate that UA-DBO consistently reduces prediction errors in optimized samples and achieves superior performance gains compared to original DBO. Moreover, compared to multipoint optimization based on full computational simulations, UA-DBO offers comparable optimization effectiveness while significantly accelerating optimization speed.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc778\uc2dd \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654(UA-DBO) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc11c\ube0c \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\uace0, \uc608\uce21 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \uc904\uc5ec \uae30\uc874 DBO\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90c.", "motivation": "\ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654(DBO)\ub294 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \uc11c\ube0c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uacf5\uae30\uc5ed\ud559 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ubca0\uc774\uc2a4\uc758 \ud488\uc9c8\uc5d0 \ud06c\uac8c \uc758\uc874\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud655\ub960\uc801 \uc778\ucf54\ub354-\ub514\ucf54\ub354 \uc11c\ube0c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc5ec \ucd9c\ub825\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ub41c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\uace0, \uc774 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub3c4 \uc778\uc2dd \uac1d\uad00\uc801 \ud568\uc218\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ud070 \uc608\uce21 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud328\ub110\ud2f0\ub97c \ubd80\uc5ec\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "UA-DBO \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc5b4\ud3ec\uc77c \ud56d\ub825 \ubc1c\uc0b0 \ubc0f \ubdd4\ud398 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc810 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00\ub418\uc5b4 \uc608\uce21 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc904\uc774\uba70 \uc6d0\ub798 DBO\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "UA-DBO\ub294 \uc804\uccb4 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc810 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc640 \ube44\uad50\ud560 \ub54c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ud6a8\uacfc\uac00 \uc720\uc0ac\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc18d\ub3c4\ub97c \uc720\uc758\ubbf8\ud558\uac8c \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654(DBO)\ub294 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \uc11c\ube0c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubc18\ubcf5 \uacfc\uc815 \uc911\uc5d0 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud615\uc0c1\uc744 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \uacf5\uae30\uc5ed\ud559 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 DBO\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ubca0\uc774\uc2a4\uc758 \ud488\uc9c8\uc5d0 \ud06c\uac8c \uc758\uc874\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6c8\ub828 \ubd84\ud3ec \uc678\ubd80\uc758 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc740 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc608\uce21 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0 \ud63c\ub780\uc744 \uc904 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc5d0 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc774\uc0c1\uce58\ub97c \uac10\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 DBO \ub3d9\uc548 \uc11c\ube0c \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\ud558\uace0 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc778\uc2dd \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654(UA-DBO) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd9c\ub825\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ub41c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uc778\ucf54\ub354-\ub514\ucf54\ub354 \uc11c\ube0c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uace0, \uc774 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub3c4 \uc778\uc2dd \uac1d\uad00\uc801 \ud568\uc218\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ud070 \uc608\uce21 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc5d0 \ud328\ub110\ud2f0\ub97c \ubd80\uacfc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Recent studies have thus pursued making System 2 models more efficient. However, these approaches focused on output control, limiting what models produce. We argue that this paradigm is misaligned: output length is merely a symptom of the model's cognitive configuration, not the root cause. In this work, we shift the focus to capability control, which modulates \\textit{how models think} rather than \\textit{what they produce}. To realize this, we leverage existing Instruct and Thinking checkpoints through dynamic parameter interpolation, without additional training. Our pilot study establishes that linear interpolation yields a convex, monotonic Pareto frontier, underpinned by representation continuity and structural connectivity. Building on this, we propose \\textbf{DAMI} (\\textbf{D}yn\\textbf{A}mic \\textbf{M}odel \\textbf{I}nterpolation), a framework that estimates a query-specific Reasoning Intensity $\u03bb(q)$ to configure cognitive depth. For training-based estimation, we develop a preference learning method encoding accuracy and efficiency criteria. For zero-shot deployment, we introduce a confidence-based method leveraging inter-model cognitive discrepancy. Experiments on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that DAMI achieves higher accuracy than the Thinking model while remaining efficient, effectively combining the efficiency of System 1

Existing LLM-based reasoning methods prioritize contextual over structural relations, struggling to extract relevant subgraphs from dynamic graphs. This limits structural information understanding, leading to unstructured, hallucination-prone inferences especially with temporal inconsistencies. To address this problem, we propose IGETR (Integration of Graph and Editing-enhanced Temporal Reasoning), a hybrid reasoning framework that combines the structured temporal modeling capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with the contextual understanding of LLMs. IGETR operates through a three-stage pipeline. The first stage aims to ground the reasoning process in the actual data by identifying structurally and temporally coherent candidate paths through a temporal GNN, ensuring that inference starts from reliable graph-based evidence. The second stage introduces LLM-guided path editing to address logical and semantic inconsistencies, leveraging external knowledge to refine and enhance the initial paths. The final stage focuses on integrating the refined reasoning paths to produce predictions that are both accurate and interpretable. Experiments on standard TKG benchmarks show that IGETR achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong baselines with relative improvements of up to 5.6% on Hits@1 and 8.1% on Hits@3 on the challenging ICEWS datasets.

Yet many large language models do the opposite: they interpret negated instructions as affirmations. We audited 16 models across 14 ethical scenarios and found that open-source models endorse prohibited actions 77% of the time under simple negation and 100% under compound negation -- a 317% increase over affirmative framing. Commercial models fare better but still show swings of 19-128%. Agreement between models drops from 74% on affirmative prompts to 62% on negated ones, and financial scenarios prove twice as fragile as medical ones. These patterns hold under deterministic decoding, ruling out sampling noise. We present case studies showing how these failures play out in practice, propose the Negation Sensitivity Index (NSI) as a governance metric, and outline a tiered certification framework with domain-specific thresholds.

Most existing memory systems serialize history as text, where token-level cost is uniform and scales linearly with length, often spending scarce budget on low-value details. To this end, we introduce MemOCR, a multimodal memory agent that improves long-horizon reasoning under tight context budgets by allocating memory space with adaptive information density through visual layout. Concretely, MemOCR maintains a structured rich-text memory (e.g., headings, highlights) and renders it into an image that the agent consults for memory access, visually prioritizing crucial evidence while aggressively compressing auxiliary details. To ensure robustness across varying memory budgets, we train MemOCR with reinforcement learning under budget-aware objectives that expose the agent to diverse compression levels. Across long-context multi-hop and single-hop question-answering benchmarks, MemOCR outperforms strong text-based baselines and achieves more effective context utilization under extreme budgets.", "AI": {"tldr": "MemOCR\ub294 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc608\uc0b0\uc5d0\uc11c \uae34 \ud638\ub9ac\uc98c\uc2a4 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \ub808\uc774\uc544\uc6c3\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubc00\ub3c4\ub85c \ubc30\ubd84\ud558\ub294 \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uae34 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uae30\ub85d\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc555\ucd95\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131.", "method": "MemOCR\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ub9ac\uce58 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub85c \ub80c\ub354\ub9c1\ud558\uc5ec \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\uc5d0 \uc811\uadfc\ud560 \ub54c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uba70, \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc99d\uac70\ub97c \uc2dc\uac01\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b0\uc120\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uae34 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud649 \ubc0f \ub2e8\uc77c \ud649 \uc9c8\ubb38-\uc751\ub2f5 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c MemOCR\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc744 \ub2a5\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "MemOCR\ub294 \uadf9\ub2e8\uc801\uc778 \uc608\uc0b0\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \ub354 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud65c\uc6a9\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uae34 \ud638\ub9ac\uc98c\uc2a4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \ucd94\ub860\uc740 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uc774\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc708\ub3c4\uc6b0\ub85c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc555\ucd95\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ud788\uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9ac\ub97c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub85c \uc9c1\ub82c\ud654\ud558\uba70, \uc5ec\uae30\uc11c \ud1a0\ud070 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ube44\uc6a9\uc740 \uade0\uc77c\ud558\uace0 \uae38\uc774\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc120\ud615\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ub418\uc5b4 \uc885\uc885 \ub0ae\uc740 \uac00\uce58\uc758 \uc138\ubd80 \uc815\ubcf4\uc5d0 \ubd80\uc871\ud55c \uc608\uc0b0\uc744 \uc18c\ubaa8\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 MemOCR\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \ub808\uc774\uc544\uc6c3\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubc00\ub3c4\ub85c \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \ud560\ub2f9\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uae34 \ud638\ub9ac\uc98c\uc2a4 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc608\uc0b0\uc5d0\uc11c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, MemOCR\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ub9ac\uce58 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac(\uc608: \uc81c\ubaa9, \ud558\uc774\ub77c\uc774\ud2b8)\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc811\uadfc\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ucc38\uc870\ud558\ub294 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub85c \ub80c\ub354\ub9c1\ud558\uc5ec, \uc911\uc694 \uc99d\uac70\ub97c \uc2dc\uac01\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b0\uc120\uc2dc\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ubcf4\uc870 \uc138\ubd80\uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc801\uadf9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc555\ucd95\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc608\uc0b0\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 MemOCR\ub97c \uc608\uc0b0 \uc778\uc2dd \ubaa9\ud45c\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc73c\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\uc2dc\ucf30\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc555\ucd95 \uc218\uc900\uc5d0 \ub178\ucd9c\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae34 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud649 \ubc0f \ub2e8\uc77c \ud649 \uc9c8\ubb38-\uc751\ub2f5 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c MemOCR\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc744 \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\uace0 \uadf9\ub2e8\uc801\uc778 \uc608\uc0b0 \uc544\ub798\uc5d0\uc11c \ub354 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud65c\uc6a9\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

The aim of EIP is to invert for an ensemble that is distributed according to the pushforward of a prior under a forward process. In high energy physics (HEP), this is related to a widely known problem called unfolding, which aims to reconstruct the true physics distribution of quantities, such as momentum and angle, from measurements that are distorted by detector effects. In recent applications, the EIP also arises in full waveform inversion (FWI) and inverse imaging with unknown priors. We propose non-iterative inference-time methods that construct posterior samplers based on a new class of conditional generative models, which we call ensemble inverse generative models. For the posterior modeling, these models additionally use the ensemble information contained in the observation set on top of single measurements. Unlike existing methods, our proposed methods avoid explicit and iterative use of the forward model at inference time via training across several sets of truth-observation pairs that are consistent with the same forward model, but originate from a wide range of priors. We demonstrate that this training procedure implicitly encodes the likelihood model. The use of ensemble information helps posterior inference and enables generalization to unseen priors. We benchmark the proposed method on several synthetic and real datasets in inverse imaging, HEP, and FWI.

Each agent maintains private GPU-resident states, including models, prefix caches, and adapters, which quickly exhaust device memory as the agent count grows. We identify two key properties of these workloads: sparse agent activation and an estimable agent invocation order. Based on an analysis of representative workload classes, we introduce invocation distance, a unified abstraction that estimates the relative order in which agents will issue future LLM requests. Leveraging this abstraction, we present ScaleSim, a memory-efficient LLM serving system for large-scale multi-agent simulations.

Given a natural language goal and an evaluation method, KAPSO iteratively performs ideation, code synthesis and editing, execution, evaluation, and learning to improve a runnable artifact toward measurable objectives. Rather than treating synthesis as the endpoint, KAPSO uses synthesis as an operator within a long-horizon optimization loop, where progress is defined by evaluator outcomes.\n  KAPSO targets long-horizon failures common in coding agents, including lost experimental state, brittle debugging, and weak reuse of domain expertise, by integrating three tightly coupled components. First, a git-native experimentation engine isolates each attempt as a branch, producing reproducible artifacts and preserving provenance across iterations. Second, a knowledge system ingests heterogeneous sources, including repositories, internal playbooks, and curated external resources such as documentation, scientific papers, and web search results, and organizes them into a structured representation that supports retrieval over workflows, implementations, and environment constraints. Third, a cognitive memory layer coordinates retrieval and maintains an episodic store of reusable lessons distilled from experiment traces (run logs, diffs, and evaluator feedback), reducing repeated error modes and accelerating convergence.\n  We evaluated KAPSO on MLE-Bench (Kaggle-style ML competitions) and ALE-Bench (AtCoder heuristic optimization), and report end-to-end performance.\n  Code Available at: https://github.com/Leeroo-AI/kapso", "AI": {"tldr": "KAPSO\ub294 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc640 \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \uc790\uc728 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8 \ud569\uc131\uacfc \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ubaa8\ub4c8\ud615 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ucf54\ub529 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uc7a5\uae30 \uc2e4\ud328\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 KAPSO\uc758 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "KAPSO\ub294 \uc544\uc774\ub514\uc5b4 \uc0dd\uc131, \ucf54\ub4dc \ud569\uc131 \ubc0f \ud3b8\uc9d1, \uc2e4\ud589, \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc0f \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc5ec \uce21\uc815 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ud5a5\ud55c \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc544\ud2f0\ud329\ud2b8\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "MLE-Bench\uc640 ALE-Bench\uc5d0\uc11c KAPSO\uc758 \uc885\ub2e8 \uac04 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "KAPSO\ub294 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc758 \uc190\uc2e4, \ucde8\uc57d\ud55c \ub514\ubc84\uae45 \ubc0f \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc804\ubb38 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc758 \uc57d\ud55c \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc790\uc728 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8 \ud569\uc131\uacfc \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ubaa8\ub4c8\ud615 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 KAPSO\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc640 \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc8fc\uc5b4\uc9c0\uba74, KAPSO\ub294 \uc544\uc774\ub514\uc5b4 \uc0dd\uc131, \ucf54\ub4dc \ud569\uc131 \ubc0f \ud3b8\uc9d1, \uc2e4\ud589, \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc0f \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc544\ud2f0\ud329\ud2b8\ub97c \uce21\uc815 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \uac1c\uc120\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud569\uc131\uc744 \ub05d\uc810\uc73c\ub85c \ucde8\uae09\ud558\ub294 \ub300\uc2e0, KAPSO\ub294 \ud569\uc131\uc744 \uc7a5\uae30 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ub8e8\ud504 \ub0b4\uc758 \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc790\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc9c4\ud589 \uc0c1\ud669\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\uc790\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub85c \uc815\uc758\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

We present ShardMemo, a budgeted tiered memory service with Tier A per-agent working state, Tier B sharded evidence with shard-local approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) indexes, and Tier C, a versioned skill library. Tier B enforces scope-before-routing: structured eligibility constraints mask ineligible shards before routing or ANN search. We cast shard probing as masked mixture-of-experts (MoE) routing over eligible shards, probing up to $B_{\\mathrm{probe}}$ shards via Top-$B_{\\mathrm{probe}}$ or adaptive Top-$P$, and use cost-aware gating over profile/observation/session shard families; the router is trained from evidence-to-shard supervision. On LoCoMo, ShardMemo improves over the strongest baseline (GAM) by +5.11 to +6.82 F1 across question categories. Under a fixed-budget routing setting ($B_{\\mathrm{probe}}=3$), ShardMemo improves over cosine-to-prototype shard routing by +6.87 F1 while reducing retrieval work (VecScan 521->414, -20.5%) and p95 latency (95->76 ms). On long-context HotpotQA, ShardMemo achieves 63.41/61.88/57.95 F1 at 56K/224K/448K tokens.

This has established Context Engineering (CE) as a formal discipline for optimizing these inputs. Current CE methods rely on manually crafted harnesses, such as rigid generation-reflection workflows and predefined context schemas. They impose structural biases and restrict context optimization to a narrow, intuition-bound design space. To address this, we introduce Meta Context Engineering (MCE), a bi-level framework that supersedes static CE heuristics by co-evolving CE skills and context artifacts. In MCE iterations, a meta-level agent refines engineering skills via agentic crossover, a deliberative search over the history of skills, their executions, and evaluations. A base-level agent executes these skills, learns from training rollouts, and optimizes context as flexible files and code. We evaluate MCE across five disparate domains under offline and online settings.

However, this scaling capability remains severely bottlenecked by a reliance on labor-intensive manual oversight from intricate reward shaping to hyperparameter tuning across heterogeneous backends. Inspired by LLMs' success in software automation and science discovery, we introduce \\textsc{EmboCoach-Bench}, a benchmark evaluating the capacity of LLM agents to autonomously engineer embodied policies. Spanning 32 expert-curated RL and IL tasks, our framework posits executable code as the universal interface. We move beyond static generation to assess a dynamic closed-loop workflow, where agents leverage environment feedback to iteratively draft, debug, and optimize solutions, spanning improvements from physics-informed reward design to policy architectures such as diffusion policies. Extensive evaluations yield three critical insights: (1) autonomous agents can qualitatively surpass human-engineered baselines by 26.5\\% in average success rate; (2) agentic workflow with environment feedback effectively strengthens policy development and substantially narrows the performance gap between open-source and proprietary models; and (3) agents exhibit self-correction capabilities for pathological engineering cases, successfully resurrecting task performance from near-total failures through iterative simulation-in-the-loop debugging. Ultimately, this work establishes a foundation for self-evolving embodied intelligence, accelerating the paradigm shift from labor-intensive manual tuning to scalable, autonomous engineering in embodied AI field.", "AI": {"tldr": "EmboCoach-Bench\ub294 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\ud604\ub41c \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "Embodied AI \ubd84\uc57c\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18 \ubaa9\uc801\uc758 \ub85c\ubd07 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ud5a5\ud55c \ube60\ub978 \uc9c4\ud654\ub97c \ubaa9\uaca9\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\ub098, \ub178\ub3d9 \uc9d1\uc57d\uc801\uc778 \uc218\ub3d9 \uac10\ub3c5\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "32\uac1c\uc758 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uac00 \uc120\uc815\ud55c RL \ubc0f IL \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc544\uc6b0\ub974\uba70, \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ucf54\ub4dc\ub97c \ubcf4\ud3b8\uc801 \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\ub85c \uc124\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ud3c9\uade0 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uac04\uc774 \uc124\uacc4\ud55c \uae30\uc900\uc744 26.5% \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\uba70, \ud658\uacbd \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\uac00 \uc815\ucc45 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub178\ub3d9 \uc9d1\uc57d\uc801\uc778 \uc218\ub3d9 \uc870\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc790\uc728 \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\ub9c1\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784 \uc804\ud658\uc744 \uac00\uc18d\ud560 \uae30\ubc18\uc744 \ub9c8\ub828\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "Embodied AI \ubd84\uc57c\ub294 \uace0\ucda9\uc2e4\ub3c4 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uacfc \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc218\uc9d1\uc5d0 \ud798\uc785\uc5b4 \uc77c\ubc18 \ubaa9\uc801\uc758 \ub85c\ubd07 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc73c\ub85c \ube60\ub974\uac8c \uc9c4\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5 \ub2a5\ub825\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc124\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \uc870\uc815\uae4c\uc9c0 \ub178\ub3d9 \uc9d1\uc57d\uc801\uc778 \uc218\ub3d9 \uac10\ub3c5\uc5d0 \uc2ec\uac01\ud558\uac8c \uc758\uc874\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654 \ubc0f \uacfc\ud559 \ubc1c\uacac\uc5d0\uc11c LLM\uc758 \uc131\uacf5\uc5d0 \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc544, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\ud604\ub41c \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc778 EmboCoach-Bench\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4. 32\uac1c\uc758 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uac00 \uc120\ubcc4\ud55c RL \ubc0f IL \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc544\uc6b0\ub974\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ucf54\ub4dc\ub97c \ubcf4\ud3b8\uc801 \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\ub85c \uc124\uc815\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc815\uc801 \uc0dd\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc97\uc5b4\ub098 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ud658\uacbd \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \ucd08\uc548, \ub514\ubc84\uadf8 \ubc0f \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801 \ud3d0\uc1c4 \ub8e8\ud504 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc2e4\uc81c\ub85c \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc124\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c\ubd80\ud130 \ud655\uc0b0 \uc815\ucc45\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc815\ucc45 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \uac1c\uc120\uc5d0 \uc774\ub974\uae30\uae4c\uc9c0 \ud3c9\uac00 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud55c\ub2e4: (1) \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ud3c9\uade0 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uac04\uc774 \uc124\uacc4\ud55c \uae30\uc900\uc744 26.5% \ucd08\uacfc\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4;

However, agentic workflows often require many iterative reasoning steps and tool invocations, leading to significant operational expense, end-to-end latency and failures due to hallucinations. This work introduces Agent Workflow Optimization (AWO), a framework that identifies and optimizes redundant tool execution patterns to improve the efficiency and robustness of agentic workflows. AWO analyzes existing workflow traces to discover recurring sequences of tool calls and transforms them into meta-tools, which are deterministic, composite tools that bundle multiple agent actions into a single invocation. Meta-tools bypass unnecessary intermediate LLM reasoning steps and reduce operational cost while also shortening execution paths, leading to fewer failures.

However, existing methods primarily model preference changes based on explicit user-item interactions, which are sparse, noisy, and unable to reflect the real-time, mutual influences among users and items. To address these limitations, we propose RecNet, a self-evolving preference propagation framework that proactively propagates real-time preference updates across related users and items. RecNet consists of two complementary phases. In the forward phase, the centralized preference routing mechanism leverages router agents to integrate preference updates and dynamically propagate them to the most relevant agents. To ensure accurate and personalized integration of propagated preferences, we further introduce a personalized preference reception mechanism, which combines a message buffer for temporary caching and an optimizable, rule-based filter memory to guide selective preference assimilation based on past experience and interests. In the backward phase, the feedback-driven propagation optimization mechanism simulates a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, using LLMs for credit assignment, gradient analysis, and module-level optimization, enabling continuous self-evolution of propagation strategies. Extensive experiments on various scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of RecNet in modeling preference propagation for recommender systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "RecNet\uc740 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc640 \uc544\uc774\ud15c \uac04\uc758 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \uc120\ud638 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \uc790\uae30 \uc9c4\ud654\ud615 \uc120\ud638 \uc804\ud30c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 \ucd94\ucc9c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790-\uc544\uc774\ud15c \uac04\uc758 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc778 \uc120\ud638 \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "RecNet\uc740 \uc120\ud638 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\ud30c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc0c1\ud638 \ubcf4\uc644\uc801\uc778 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uc804\ubc29 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc640 \ud6c4\ubc29 \ub2e8\uacc4.", "result": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 RecNet\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "RecNet\uc740 \ucd94\ucc9c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc120\ud638 \uc804\ud30c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc744 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud589\ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \ucd94\ucc9c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uace0 \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790-\uc544\uc774\ud15c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \uc120\ud638 \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \uc8fc\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ub4dc\ubb3c\uace0 \ub178\uc774\uc988\uac00 \ub9ce\uc73c\uba70 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc640 \uc544\uc774\ud15c \uac04\uc758 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubc18\uc601\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uad00\ub828\ub41c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc640 \uc544\uc774\ud15c \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \uc120\ud638 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\ud30c\ud558\ub294 \uc790\uae30 \uc9c4\ud654\ud615 \uc120\ud638 \uc804\ud30c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 RecNet\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

We introduce WhatCounts to test this property in isolation. Unlike prior work that conflates semantic sensitivity with reasoning complexity or prompt variation, WhatCounts is atomic: count items in an unambiguous, delimited list with no duplicates, distractors, or reasoning steps for different semantic types. Frontier LLMs show over 40% accuracy variation depending solely on what is being counted - cities versus chemicals, names versus symbols. Controlled ablations rule out confounds. The gap is semantic, and it shifts unpredictably with small amounts of unrelated fine-tuning. LLMs do not implement algorithms; they approximate them, and the approximation is argument-dependent. As we show with an agentic example, this has implications beyond counting: any LLM function may carry hidden dependencies on the meaning of its inputs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uacc4\uc0b0\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0\ub418\ub294 \uac83\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uc548 \ub418\uba70, \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \ub3d9\uc791\uc740 \uc778\uc790\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8 \ub0b4\uc6a9\uc5d0 \ubd88\ubcc0\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4.

However, prevalent memory preprocessing paradigms suffer from destructive de-contextualization. By compressing complex sequential dependencies into pre-defined structures (e.g., embeddings or graphs), these methods sever the contextual integrity essential for deep reasoning. To address this, we propose E-mem, a framework shifting from Memory Preprocessing to Episodic Context Reconstruction. Inspired by biological engrams, E-mem employs a heterogeneous hierarchical architecture where multiple assistant agents maintain uncompressed memory contexts, while a central master agent orchestrates global planning. Unlike passive retrieval, our mechanism empowers assistants to locally reason within activated segments, extracting context-aware evidence before aggregation. Evaluations on the LoCoMo benchmark demonstrate that E-mem achieves over 54\\% F1, surpassing the state-of-the-art GAM by 7.75\\%, while reducing token cost by over 70\\%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 E-mem \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 System~2 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc804\ucc98\ub9ac\uc5d0\uc11c \uc11c\uc0ac\uc801 \ubb38\ub9e5 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\ud658\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "Large Language Model (LLM) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 System~2 \ucd94\ub860\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \uc815\uad50\ud558\uace0 \ub192\uc740 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc804\ucc98\ub9ac \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc744 \uc0c1\uc2e4\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "E-mem \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubcf4\uc870 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc555\ucd95\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ub9e5\ub77d\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \uc911\uc559 \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud130 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc804\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc870\uc728\ud558\ub294 \ube44\ub3d9\uc9c8\uc801 \uacc4\uce35 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ud65c\uc131\ud654\ub41c \uad6c\uc5ed \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uad6d\uc18c\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\ub860\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\uc5ec \ub9e5\ub77d \uc778\uc2dd \uc99d\uac70\ub97c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud55c \ud6c4 \uc9d1\uacc4\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "LoCoMo \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ud3c9\uac00 \uacb0\uacfc, E-mem\uc740 54\text{ F1}\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \ucd5c\uc2e0 GAM\uc744 7.75\text{ F1} \ucd08\uacfc \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "E-mem\uc740 70\text{ %} \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \ud1a0\ud070 \ube44\uc6a9 \uc808\uac10\uc744 \uc774\ub8e8\uba70 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc2ec\uce35\uc801\uc778 \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc644\uc804\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c System~2 \ucd94\ub860\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c4\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uae34 \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc644\uc804\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc804\ucc98\ub9ac \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc740 \ud30c\uad34\uc801\uc778 \ubb38\ub9e5 \uc0c1\uc2e4\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uacaa\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc21c\ucc28\uc801 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \uace0\uc815\ub41c \uad6c\uc870(\uc608: \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc774\ub098 \uadf8\ub798\ud504)\ub85c \uc555\ucd95\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uae4a\uc740 \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc778 \ubb38\ub9e5 \ubb34\uacb0\uc131\uc744 \ub04a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc804\ucc98\ub9ac\uc5d0\uc11c \uc11c\uc0ac\uc801 \ubb38\ub9e5 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \uc804\ud658\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\ub294 E-mem \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801 \uc778\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc740 E-mem\uc740 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubcf4\uc870 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ube44\uc555\ucd95 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ubb38\ub9e5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \uc911\uc559 \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud130 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc804\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc870\uc728\ud558\ub294 \ube44\ub3d9\uc9c8\uc801 \uacc4\uce35 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ucc44\ud0dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc218\ub3d9\uc801 \uac80\uc0c9\uacfc\ub294 \ub2ec\ub9ac \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc740 \ubcf4\uc870 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ud65c\uc131\ud654\ub41c \uad6c\uc5ed \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uad6d\uc18c\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\ub860\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\uc5ec \uc9d1\uacc4 \uc804\uc5d0 \ub9e5\ub77d \uc778\uc2dd \uc99d\uac70\ub97c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Existing robustness strategies either prune data or rely on costly prior quantification, failing to balance effectiveness and efficiency. In this paper, we introduce DropoutTS, a model-agnostic plugin that shifts the paradigm from \"what\" to learn to \"how much\" to learn. DropoutTS employs a Sample-Adaptive Dropout mechanism: leveraging spectral sparsity to efficiently quantify instance-level noise via reconstruction residuals, it dynamically calibrates model learning capacity by mapping noise to adaptive dropout rates - selectively suppressing spurious fluctuations while preserving fine-grained fidelity. Extensive experiments across diverse noise regimes and open benchmarks show DropoutTS consistently boosts superior backbones' performance, delivering advanced robustness with negligible parameter overhead and no architectural modifications.

Previous work attributes this performance gap to the mismatch between the pretraining distribution and the testing distribution. In this work, we demonstrate the primary bottleneck is the prohibitive cost of exploration: mastering these tasks requires extensive trial-and-error, which is computationally unsustainable for parameter-heavy LLMs operating in a high dimensional semantic space. To address this, we propose SCOUT (Sub-Scale Collaboration On Unseen Tasks), a novel framework that decouples exploration from exploitation. We employ lightweight \"scouts\" (e.g., small MLPs) to probe environmental dynamics at a speed and scale far exceeding LLMs. The collected trajectories are utilized to bootstrap the LLM via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), followed by multi-turn Reinforcement Learning (RL) to activate its latent world knowledge. Empirically, SCOUT enables a Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct model to achieve an average score of 0.86, significantly outperforming proprietary models, including Gemini-2.5-Pro (0.60), while saving about 60% GPU hours consumption.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc774 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \uae30\ubc18 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub098\uc9c0\ub9cc \ube44\uc5b8\uc5b4\uc801 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud0d0\uc0c9-\ud65c\uc6a9 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 SCOUT\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \uaca9\ucc28\ub294 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc640 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc758 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58 \ub54c\ubb38\uc774\ub77c\uace0 \uc5ec\uaca8\uc84c\uc73c\ub098, \uc2e4\uc81c\ub85c\ub294 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \uc8fc\ub41c \ubcd1\ubaa9\ud604\uc0c1\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "method": "SCOUT\uc740 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uacfc \ud65c\uc6a9\uc744 \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\uc5ec \uacbd\ub7c9\uc758 '\uc815\ucc30\ubcd1'(\uc608: \uc791\uc740 MLP)\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud658\uacbd \ub3d9\ud0dc\ub97c \ube60\ub974\uace0 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud558\uac8c \uc870\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "SCOUT\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud3c9\uade0 \uc810\uc218 0.86\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, Gemini-2.5-Pro(0.60) \ub4f1 \uc0c1\uc6a9 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "SCOUT\uc740 LLM\uc774 \ub192\uc740 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uc138\ud55c \uc138\ubd80 \uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \uc219\ub2ec\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc2dc\ud589\ucc29\uc624\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc904\uc774\ub294 \ub370 \uae30\uc5ec\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \uae30\ubc18 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub098\uc9c0\ub9cc \ubcf4\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c \ube44\uc5b8\uc5b4\uc801 \ud658\uacbd(\uc608: \uc0c1\uc9d5\uc801 \ub610\ub294 \uacf5\uac04\uc801 \uc791\uc5c5)\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc740 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774\uc804 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc640 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ubd84\ud3ec \uac04\uc758 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub85c \uc124\uba85\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc8fc\uc694 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc774 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc758 \ub192\uc740 \ube44\uc6a9\uc784\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud55c\ub2e4: \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud130\ud558\ub294 \ub370\uc5d0\ub294 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2dc\ud589\ucc29\uc624\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ub192\uc740 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\ub294 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \uc9d1\uc57d\uc801\uc778 LLM\uc5d0\ub294 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c0\uc18d \ubd88\uac00\ub2a5\ud558\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 SCOUT(\ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud558\uc704 \uaddc\ubaa8 \ud611\uc5c5)\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc5ec\uae30\ub294 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\uacfc \ubd84\ub9ac\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uacbd\ub7c9\uc758 '\uc815\ucc30\ubcd1'(\uc608: \uc791\uc740 MLP)\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec LLM\uc744 \ub2a5\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uc18d\ub3c4\uc640 \uaddc\ubaa8\ub85c \ud658\uacbd \ub3d9\ud0dc\ub97c \ud0d0\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc218\uc9d1\ub41c \uada4\uc801\uc740 \uac10\ub3c5\ub41c \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 LLM\uc744 \ubd80\ud2b8\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub7a9\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uba70, \uc774\uc5b4 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud134 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uadf8 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801\uc778 \uc138\uacc4 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud65c\uc131\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4. \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, SCOUT\uc740 Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud3c9\uade0 \uc810\uc218 0.86\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec Gemini-2.5-Pro(0.60)\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc0c1\uc6a9 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc720\uc758\ubbf8\ud55c \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, \uc57d 60%\uc758 GPU \uc2dc\uac04 \uc18c\ube44\ub97c \uc808\uc57d\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

The benchmark contains curated end-to-end tasks (e.g., RNA-seq, variant calling, metagenomics) with prompts that specify concrete output artifacts to support automated assessment, including stress testing under controlled perturbations. We evaluate frontier closed-source and open-weight models across multiple agent harnesses, and use an LLM-based grader to score pipeline progress and outcome validity. We find that frontier agents can complete multi-step bioinformatics pipelines without elaborate custom scaffolding, often producing the requested final artifacts reliably. However, robustness tests reveal failure modes under controlled perturbations (corrupted inputs, decoy files, and prompt bloat), indicating that correct high-level pipeline construction does not guarantee reliable step-level reasoning. Finally, because bioinformatics workflows may involve sensitive patient data, proprietary references, or unpublished IP, closed-source models can be unsuitable under strict privacy constraints; in such settings, open-weight models may be preferable despite lower completion rates. We release the dataset and evaluation suite publicly.", "AI": {"tldr": "BioAgent Bench\ub294 \uc0dd\ubb3c\uc815\ubcf4\ud559 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758

The system integrates three optimization modules, encompassing real-time perception,dynamic role orchestration, and pipeline-parallel execution, to facilitate efficient and rapid collaboration among distributed agents. Furthermore, we introduce a novel role affinity scheduling algorithm for dynamically orchestrating LLM role assignments across the hierarchical edge infrastructure, intelligently matching computational demands with available dispersed resources.Finally, comprehensive case studies and performance evaluations across various 6G application scenarios demonstrated the efficacy of CORE, revealing significant enhancements in the system efficiency and task completion rates. Building on these promising outcomes, we further validated the practical applicability of CORE by deploying it on a real-world edge-computing platform,that exhibits robust performance in operational

With the advent of Foundation Models (FMs), the field of AI-assisted ECG interpretation has begun to evolve, as they enable model reuse across different tasks by relying on embeddings. However, to responsibly employ FMs, it is crucial to rigorously assess to which extent the embeddings they produce are generalizable, particularly in error-sensitive domains such as healthcare. Although prior works have already addressed the problem of benchmarking ECG-expert FMs, they focus predominantly on the evaluation of downstream performance. To fill this gap, this study aims to find an in-depth, comprehensive benchmarking framework for FMs, with a specific focus on ECG-expert ones. To this aim, we introduce a benchmark methodology that complements performance-based evaluation with representation-level analysis, leveraging SHAP and UMAP techniques. Furthermore, we rely on the methodology for carrying out an extensive evaluation of several ECG-expert FMs pretrained via state-of-the-art techniques over different cross-continental datasets and data availability settings; this includes ones featuring data scarcity, a fairly common situation in real-world medical scenarios. Experimental results show that our benchmarking protocol provides a rich insight of ECG-expert FMs' embedded patterns, enabling a deeper understanding of their representational structure and generalizability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc2ec\uc804\ub3c4(ECG) \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc6a9 \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378(FM)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud0b9 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc131\ub2a5 \uae30\ubc18 \ud3c9\uac00\uc640 \ud45c\ud604 \uc218\uc900 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378(FM)\uc758 \ud65c\uc6a9\uc774 \uc758\ub8cc\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc624\ub958\uc5d0 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5bc\ub9c8\ub098 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c\uc9c0\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0 \ucc45\uc784\uac10 \uc788\uac8c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud568\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "SHAP\uc640 UMAP \uae30\uc220\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc131\ub2a5 \uae30\ubc18 \ud3c9\uac00\uc640 \ud45c\ud604 \uc218\uc900 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc5ec\ub7ec \uac1c\uc758 ECG \uc804\ubb38\uac00 FM\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \ud3c9\uac00 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud0b9 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc774 \uc2ec\uc804\ub3c4 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 FM\uc758 \ub0b4\uc7ac\ub41c \ud328\ud134\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774\ub294 \uc774\ub4e4\uc758 \ud45c\ud604 \uad6c\uc870\uc640 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc2ec\ub3c4 \uc788\uac8c \uc774\ud574\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud558\uba70, \uc758\ub8cc \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd80\uc871 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc2ec\uc804\ub3c4(ECG)\ub294 \ube44\uc6a9 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc811\uadfc\uc131\uc774 \ub192\uc73c\uba70 \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \uc9c4\ub2e8 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378(FMs)\uc758 \ucd9c\ud604\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c AI \uc9c0\uc6d0 ECG \ud574\uc11d \ubd84\uc57c\uac00 \ubc1c\uc804\ud558\uae30 \uc2dc\uc791\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 FMs\ub97c \ucc45\uc784\uac10 \uc788\uac8c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294, \ud2b9\ud788 \uc758\ub8cc\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc624\ub958\uc5d0 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\ub4e4\uc774 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ucca0\uc800\ud558\uac8c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uc804 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub4e4\uc740 \uc774\ubbf8 ECG \uc804\ubb38\uac00 FM\uc758 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub300\ubd80\ubd84 \ud558\uc704 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 ECG \uc804\ubb38\uac00 FM\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2ec\uce35\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud0b9 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ucc3e\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uc131\ub2a5 \uae30\ubc18 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \ud45c\ud604 \uc218\uc900 \ubd84\uc11d\uacfc complement \ud558\ub294 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, SHAP\uc640 UMAP \uae30\uc220\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \ub300\ub959 \uac04 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8 \ubc0f \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uac00\uc6a9\uc131 \uc124\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uae30\uc220\ub85c \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc5ec\ub7ec ECG \uc804\ubb38\uac00 FM\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc2e4\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5ec\uae30\uc5d0\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc758\ub8cc \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c \ud754\ud788 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd80\uc871\uc774 \ud3ec\ud568\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud0b9 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc774 ECG \uc804\ubb38\uac00 FM\uc758 \ub0b4\uc7ac\uc801 \ud328\ud134\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub4e4\uc758 \ud45c\ud604 \uad6c\uc870\uc640 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ub354 \uae4a\uc774 \uc774\ud574\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud574 \uc900\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

In such settings, outcome-based supervision is sparse and delayed, often rewarding incorrect trajectories and failing to support inference-time scaling. This motivates the use of Process Reward Models (WebPRMs) for web navigation, but existing approaches remain limited: scalar WebPRMs collapse progress into coarse, weakly grounded signals, while checklist-based WebPRMs rely on brittle template matching that fails under layout or semantic changes and often mislabels superficially correct actions as successful, providing little insight or interpretability. To address these challenges, we introduce WebArbiter, a reasoning-first, principle-inducing WebPRM that formulates reward modeling as text generation, producing structured justifications that conclude with a preference verdict and identify the action most conducive to task completion under the current context. Training follows a two-stage pipeline: reasoning distillation equips the model with coherent principle-guided reasoning, and reinforcement learning corrects teacher biases by directly aligning verdicts with correctness, enabling stronger generalization. To support systematic evaluation, we release WebPRMBench, a comprehensive benchmark spanning four diverse web environments with rich tasks and high-quality preference annotations. On WebPRMBench, WebArbiter-7B outperforms the strongest baseline, GPT-5, by 9.1 points. In reward-guided trajectory search on WebArena-Lite, it surpasses the best prior WebPRM by up to 7.2 points, underscoring its robustness and practical value in real-world complex web tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "WebArbiter\ub294 \uc6f9 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c, \uc0c1\ubc18\ub41c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc774\uc720 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ucc44\ud0dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ucef4\ud4e8\ud130 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6f9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub824\uace0 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc744 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc0dd\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uace0, \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uc6d0\uce59 \uae30\ubc18 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc815\ub2f9\ud654 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "WebArbiter-7B\ub294 WebPRMBench\uc5d0\uc11c \uac00\uc7a5 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uae30\uc900\uc778 GPT-5\ubcf4\ub2e4 9.1\uc810 \ub192\uc740 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \uae30\ub85d\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "WebArbiter\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc6f9 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uac00\uce58\uac00 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6f9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ucef4\ud4e8\ud130 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud070 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub4e4\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc740 \ube44\uac00\uc5ed\uc801\uc778 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ub3d9\ubc18\ud55c \uc7a5\uae30\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc21c\ucc28\uc801\uc778 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uacb0\uacfc \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uac10\ub3c5\uc774 \ub4dc\ubb3c\uace0 \uc9c0\uc5f0\ub418\uc5b4 \uc885\uc885 \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \uacbd\ub85c\uc5d0 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \uc8fc\uace0 \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc\uac04 \ud655\uc7a5\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc6f9 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubaa8\ub378(WebPRMs)\uc758 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uc2a4\uce7c\ub77c WebPRMs\ub294 \uc9c4\ud589\uc744 \uac70\uce60\uace0 \uc57d\ud558\uac8c \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uc2e0\ud638\ub85c \ucd95\uc18c\ud558\uba70, \uccb4\ud06c\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 WebPRMs\ub294 \ub808\uc774\uc544\uc6c3\uc774\ub098 \uc758\ubbf8 \ubcc0\uacbd\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud55c \ud15c\ud50c\ub9bf \uc77c\uce58\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uace0, \uc885\uc885 \uac89\ubcf4\uae30\uc5d0\ub294 \uc62c\ubc14\ub978 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc131\uacf5\uc73c\ub85c \uc798\ubabb \ub808\uc774\ube14\ub9c1\ud558\uc5ec \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc774\ub098 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uac70\uc758 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc6f9 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc774\uc720 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc6d0\uce59 \uc720\ub3c4 WebPRM\uc778 WebArbiter\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, existing paradigms face a critical dichotomy: they either optimize modules jointly within rigid, fixed-graph architectures, or empower dynamic planning while treating executors as frozen, black-box tools. We identify that this \\textit{decoupled optimization} creates a ``strategic-operational mismatch,'' where sophisticated planning strategies fail to materialize due to unadapted local executors, often leading to negative performance gains despite increased system complexity. In this paper, we propose \\textbf{JADE} (\\textbf{J}oint \\textbf{A}gentic \\textbf{D}ynamic \\textbf{E}xecution), a unified framework for the joint optimization of planning and execution within dynamic, multi-turn workflows. By modeling the system as a cooperative multi-agent team unified under a single shared backbone, JADE enables end-to-end learning driven by outcome-based rewards. This approach facilitates \\textit{co-adaptation}: the planner learns to operate within the capability boundaries of the executors, while the executors evolve to align with high-level strategic intent. Empirical results demonstrate that JADE transforms disjoint modules into a synergistic system, yielding remarkable performance improvements via joint optimization and enabling a flexible balance between efficiency and effectiveness through dynamic workflow orchestration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801, \ub2e4\uc911 \ud134 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\uc5d0\uc11c \uacc4\ud68d\uacfc \uc2e4\ud589\uc758 \uacf5\ub3d9 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c JADE \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "RAG\uc758 \uc9c4\ud654\ub294 \uc815\uc801 \uac80\uc0c9 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc559 \uacc4\ud68d\uc790\uac00 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud134 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc870\uc728\ud558\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub85c \uc804\ud658\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc740 \uace0\uc815 \uadf8\ub798\ud504(arhitecture) \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc744 \uacf5\ub3d9 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ub3d9\uc801 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc2e4\ud589\uae30\ub97c \uace0\uc815\ub41c \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub85c \ucde8\uae09\ud558\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uadf9\ub2e8\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ub258\uc5b4 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "JADE\ub294 \ub2e8\uc77c \uacf5\uc720 \ubc31\ubcf8 \uc544\ub798 \ud1b5\ud569\ub41c \ud611\ub825 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud300\uc73c\ub85c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uc5ec \uacc4\ud68d\uacfc \uc2e4\ud589\uc744 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uacf5\ub3d9 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "JADE\ub294 \ubd84\ub9ac\ub41c \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc744 \uc2dc\ub108\uc9c0\ub97c \uc774\ub8e8\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud615\ud558\uc5ec, \uacf5\ub3d9 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud68d\uae30\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "JADE\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0 \uc870\uc728\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \uc720\uc5f0\ud55c \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac80\uc0c9 \uc99d\uac15 \uc0dd\uc131(RAG)\uc758 \uc9c4\ud654\ub294 \uc815\uc801 \uac80\uc0c9 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc559 \uacc4\ud68d\uc790\uac00 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud134 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc870\uc728\ud558\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub85c \uc804\ud658\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc740 \uace0\uc815\ub41c \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc744 \uacf5\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uac70\ub098, \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 \ub3c4\uad6c\ucc98\ub7fc \uace0\uc815\ub41c \uc2e4\ud589\uae30\ub85c \ub300\uc6b0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ub3d9\uc801 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uadf9\ub2e8\uc801\uc778 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c '\ubd84\ub9ac\ub41c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654'\uac00 '\uc804\ub7b5-\uc6b4\uc601 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58'\ub97c \ubc1c\uc0dd\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4\uace0 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud558\uba70, \uc5ec\uae30\uc11c \uc815\uad50\ud55c \uacc4\ud68d \uc804\ub7b5\uc774 \uc801\uc808\ud55c \uc9c0\uc5ed \uc2e4\ud589\uae30 \ub355\ubd84\uc5d0 \uc2e4\uc81c\ub85c \uc2e4\ud604\ub418\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud574 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc800\ud558\ub418\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud134 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uacc4\ud68d\uacfc \uc2e4\ud589\uc758 \uacf5\ub3d9 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 JADE(\uc870\uc778\ud2b8 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \ub2e4\uc774\ub098\ubbf9 \uc2e4\ud589)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based solutions tackle this problem by coupling a length penalty with outcome-based rewards. This simplistic reward weighting struggles to reconcile brevity with accuracy, as enforcing brevity may compromise critical reasoning logic. In this work, we address this limitation by proposing a multi-agent RL framework that selectively penalizes redundant chunks, while preserving essential reasoning logic. Our framework, Self-Compression via MARL (SCMA), instantiates redundancy detection and evaluation through two specialized agents: \\textbf{a Segmentation Agent} for decomposing the reasoning process into logical chunks, and \\textbf{a Scoring Agent} for quantifying the significance of each chunk. The Segmentation and Scoring agents collaboratively define an importance-weighted length penalty during training, incentivizing \\textbf{a Reasoning Agent} to prioritize essential logic without introducing inference overhead during deployment. Empirical evaluations across model scales demonstrate that SCMA reduces response length by 11.1\\% to 39.0\\% while boosting accuracy by 4.33\\% to 10.02\\%. Furthermore, ablation studies and qualitative analysis validate that the synergistic optimization within the MARL framework fosters emergent behaviors, yielding more powerful LRMs compared to vanilla RL paradigms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc911\ubcf5 \ucd94\ub860\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \ucd94\ub860 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c \uc904\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud611\uc5c5 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ubc30\ud3ec\uc5d0 \ubcd1\ubaa9\uc744 \uc77c\uc73c\ud0a4\uace0 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc744 \uc800\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uc911\ubcf5 \ucd94\ub860\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc911\ubcf5 \uccad\ud06c\ub97c \uc120\ud0dd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubc8c\uce59\uc744 \ubd80\uacfc\ud558\uace0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc778 \ucd94\ub860 \ub17c\ub9ac\ub97c \ubcf4\uc874\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(MARL) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c, Self-Compression via MARL (SCMA)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ubaa8\ub378 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \ud3c9\uac00 \uacb0\uacfc, SCMA\ub294 \uc751\ub2f5 \uae38\uc774\ub97c 11.1%\uc5d0\uc11c 39.0% \uc904\uc774\uba74\uc11c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c 4.33%\uc5d0\uc11c 10.02% \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "MARL \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc2dc\ub108\uc9c0 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uac00 \ub354\uc6b1 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ub300\ud615 \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc911\ubcf5 \ucd94\ub860\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \ucd94\ub860 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub294 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc744 \uc800\ud574\ud558\uace0 \ub300\ud615 \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ubc30\ud3ec\uc5d0 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \ubcd1\ubaa9\ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \uc77c\uc73c\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL) \uae30\ubc18 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc740 \uacb0\uacfc \uae30\ubc18 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uacfc \uae38\uc774 \ud398\ub110\ud2f0\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub294 \uac04\uacb0\uc131\uacfc \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \uc870\ud654\ub86d\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uc73c\uba70, \uac04\uacb0\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc694\ud558\uba74 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \ub17c\ub9ac\uac00 \uc190\uc0c1\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc911\ubcf5 \uccad\ud06c\uc5d0 \uc120\ud0dd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubc8c\uce59\uc744 \ubd80\uacfc\ud558\uace0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc778 \ucd94\ub860 \ub17c\ub9ac\ub97c \ubcf4\uc874\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 RL \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Self-Compression via MARL (SCMA)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Unlike black-box approaches, our courtroom-style orchestration explicitly defines agent roles (prosecutor, defense, judge), interaction protocols (7-turn structured debate), and private reasoning strategies, creating a fully auditable decision-making process. We benchmark this framework on young adult recidivism prediction using the NLSY97 dataset, comparing it against traditional chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting across almost 90 unique combinations of models and strategies. Our results demonstrate that structured multi-agent debate provides more stable and generalizable performance compared to single-agent reasoning, with stronger correlation between accuracy and F1-score metrics. Beyond performance improvements, AgenticSimLaw offers fine-grained control over reasoning steps, generates complete interaction transcripts for explainability, and enables systematic profiling of agent behaviors. While we instantiate this framework in the criminal justice domain to stress-test reasoning under ethical complexity, the approach generalizes to any deliberative, high-stakes decision task requiring transparency and human oversight. This work addresses key LLM-based multi-agent system challenges: organization through structured roles, observability through logged interactions, and responsibility through explicit non-deployment constraints for sensitive domains.

Most evaluations score end-to-end RAG pipelines, where reasoning is confounded with retrieval and toolchain choices, and the signal is further contaminated by parametric memorization and open-web volatility. We introduce DeR2, a controlled deep-research sandbox that isolates document-grounded reasoning while preserving core difficulties of deep search: multi-step synthesis, denoising, and evidence-based conclusion making. DeR2 decouples evidence access from reasoning via four regimes--Instruction-only, Concepts (gold concepts without documents), Related-only (only relevant documents), and Full-set (relevant documents plus topically related distractors)--yielding interpretable regime gaps that operationalize retrieval loss vs. reasoning loss and enable fine-grained error attribution. To prevent parametric leakage, we apply a two-phase validation that requires parametric failure without evidence while ensuring oracle-concept solvability. To ensure reproducibility, each instance provides a frozen document library (drawn from 2023-2025 theoretical papers) with expert-annotated concepts and validated rationales. Experiments across a diverse set of state-of-the-art foundation models reveal substantial variation and significant headroom: some models exhibit mode-switch fragility, performing worse with the Full-set than with Instruction-only, while others show structural concept misuse, correctly naming concepts but failing to execute them as procedures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacfc\ud559 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc774 \uac08\uc218\ub85d \ucee4\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.

Generative methods offer a powerful alternative by unifying selection and execution, tasking the LLM to directly learn and generate tool identifiers. However, the common practice of mapping each tool to a unique new token introduces substantial limitations: it creates a scalability and generalization crisis, as the vocabulary size explodes and each tool is assigned a semantically isolated token. This approach also creates a semantic bottleneck that hinders the learning of collaborative tool relationships, as the model must infer them from sparse co-occurrences of monolithic tool IDs within a vast library. To address these limitations, we propose ToolWeaver, a novel generative tool learning framework that encodes tools into hierarchical sequences. This approach makes vocabulary expansion logarithmic to the number of tools. Crucially, it enables the model to learn collaborative patterns from the dense co-occurrence of shared codes, rather than the sparse co-occurrence of monolithic tool IDs. We generate these structured codes through a novel tokenization process designed to weave together a tool's intrinsic semantics with its extrinsic co-usage patterns. These structured codes are then integrated into the LLM through a generative alignment stage, where the model is fine-tuned to produce the hierarchical code sequences. Evaluation results with nearly 47,000 tools show that ToolWeaver significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, establishing a more scalable, generalizable, and semantically-aware foundation for advanced tool-augmented agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "ToolWeaver\ub294 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc758 \ub0b4\uc7ac\uc801 \uc758\ubbf8\uc640 \uc678\uc7ac\uc801 \uacf5\uc6a9 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec

A Comprehensive Evaluation of User Interface Design Factors", "comment": null, "summary": "Web agents have demonstrated strong performance on a wide range of web-based tasks. However, existing research on the effect of environmental variation has mostly focused on robustness to adversarial attacks, with less attention to agents' preferences in benign scenarios. Although early studies have examined how textual attributes influence agent behavior, a systematic understanding of how visual attributes shape agent decision-making remains limited. To address this, we introduce VAF, a controlled evaluation pipeline for quantifying how webpage Visual Attribute Factors influence web-agent decision-making. Specifically, VAF consists of three stages: (i) variant generation, which ensures the variants share identical semantics as the original item while only differ in visual attributes; (ii) browsing interaction, where agents navigate the page via scrolling and clicking the interested item, mirroring how human users browse online; (iii) validating through both click action and reasoning from agents, which we use the Target Click Rate and Target Mention Rate to jointly evaluate the effect of visual attributes. By quantitatively measuring the decision-making difference between the original and variant, we identify which visual attributes influence agents' behavior most. Extensive experiments, across 8 variant families (48 variants total), 5 real-world websites (including shopping, travel, and news browsing), and 4 representative web agents, show that background color contrast, item size, position, and card clarity have a strong influence on agents' actions, whereas font styling, text color, and item image clarity exhibit minor effects.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc6f9 \ud398\uc774\uc9c0\uc758 \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \uc18d\uc131\uc774 \uc6f9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc815\ub7c9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 VAF\ub77c\ub294 \ud3c9\uac00 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud658\uacbd \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uae30\uc874 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc8fc\ub85c \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacac\uace0\uc131\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uc5c8\uace0, \uc628\uac74\ud55c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc120\ud638\ub3c4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ubd80\uc871\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc6f9 \ud398\uc774\uc9c0 \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \uc18d\uc131\uc774 \uc6f9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc815\ub7c9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 VAF\ub77c\ub294 \uc138 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \ud3c9\uac00 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: (i) \ubcc0\ud615 \uc0dd\uc131, (ii) \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9, (iii) \ud074\ub9ad \ud589\ub3d9\uacfc \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \uac80\uc99d.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \ubc30\uacbd \uc0c9 \ub300\ube44, \uc544\uc774\ud15c \ud06c\uae30, \uc704\uce58, \uce74\ub4dc \uba85\ub8cc\uc131\uc774 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \uac15\ud55c \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \ubc18\uba74, \uae00\uaf34 \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c, \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc0c9\uc0c1, \uc544\uc774\ud15c \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uba85\ub8cc\uc131\uc740 \ubbf8\ubbf8\ud55c \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce5c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc6f9 \ud398\uc774\uc9c0 \ub514\uc790\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc6f9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc5d0 \ud070 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce68\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6f9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc6f9 \uae30\ubc18 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ud658\uacbd \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uae30\uc874 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc8fc\ub85c \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacac\uace0\uc131\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uc628\uac74\ud55c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc120\ud638\ub3c4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ubd80\uc871\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd08\uae30 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub4e4\uc740 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc18d\uc131\uc774 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc0b4\ud3b4\ubcf4\uc558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \uc18d\uc131\uc774 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ud615\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \uc774\ud574\ub294 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc6f9 \ud398\uc774\uc9c0\uc758 \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \uc18d\uc131\uc774 \uc6f9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud1b5\uc81c\ub41c \ud3c9\uac00 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc778 VAF\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

This paper introduces Liquid Interfaces, a coordination paradigm in which interfaces are not persistent technical artifacts, but ephemeral relational events that emerge through intention articulation and semantic negotiation at runtime.We formalize this model and present the Liquid Interface Protocol (LIP),which governs intention-driven interaction, negotiated execution, and enforce ephemerality under semantic uncertainty. We further discuss the governance implications of this approach and describe a reference architecture that demonstrates practical feasibility. Liquid Interfaces provide a principled foundation for adaptive coordination in agent-based systems", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uace0\uc720\ud55c \uc5f0\uad00 \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 Liquid Interfaces\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud611\uc5c5 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud604\ub300 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub294 \uc801\uc751\ud615, \ud655\ub960\uc801, \ub9e5\ub77d \uc758\uc874\uc801\uc778 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ud1b5\ud569\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc815\uc801 \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\uc640 \uacb0\uc815\ub860\uc801 \uacc4\uc57d\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc9c0\ubc30\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc758\ub3c4 \ud45c\ud604\uacfc \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \ud611\uc0c1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub7f0\ud0c0\uc784\uc5d0 \uc0dd\uc131\ub418\ub294 \ube44\uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uad00\uacc4 \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8\ub85c\uc11c\uc758 \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4 \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \ud615\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uace0, \uc758\ub3c4 \uc8fc\ub3c4 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uacfc \ud611\uc0c1\ub41c \uc2e4\ud589\uc744 \uc870\uc728\ud558\uba70 \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \ub367\uc5c6\uc74c\uc744 \uac15\uc81c\ud558\ub294 Liquid Interface Protocol (LIP)\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \uad00\ub9ac\uc801 \uc758\ubbf8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub17c\uc758\ud558\uace0 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801 \ud0c0\ub2f9\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\ub294 \ucc38\uace0 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uc124\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Liquid Interfaces\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc6d0\uce59 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ud1a0\ub300\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud604\ub300 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub294 \uc801\uc751\ud615, \ud655\ub960\uc801, \ub9e5\ub77d \uc758\uc874\uc801\uc778 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ud1b5\ud569\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc815\uc801 \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\uc640 \uacb0\uc815\ub860\uc801 \uacc4\uc57d\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc9c0\ubc30\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 Liquid Interfaces\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uae30\uc220 \uc778\ud504\ub77c\uac00 \uc544\ub2cc, \uc758\ub3c4 \ud45c\ud604\uacfc \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \ud611\uc0c1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub7f0\ud0c0\uc784\uc5d0 \ub098\ud0c0\ub098\ub294 \ub367\uc5c6\ub294 \uad00\uacc4 \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8\ub85c\uc11c \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\uc758 \uc870\uc815 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud615\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uc758\ub3c4 \uc8fc\ub3c4 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\uace0 \ud611\uc0c1\ub41c \uc2e4\ud589\uc744 \uaddc\uc728\ud558\uba70 \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \ub367\uc5c6\uc74c\uc744 \uac15\uc81c\ud558\ub294 Liquid Interface Protocol (LIP)\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \uad00\ub9ac\uc801 \uc758\ubbf8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub17c\uc758\ud558\uace0 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801 \ud0c0\ub2f9\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\ub294 \ucc38\uace0 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uc124\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

We introduce two metrics - Operational Intensity (OI) and Capacity Footprint (CF) - that jointly explain regimes the classic roofline analysis misses, including the memory capacity wall. Across agentic workflows (chat, coding, web use, computer use) and base model choices (GQA/MLA, MoE, quantization), OI/CF can shift dramatically, with long context KV cache making decode highly memory bound. These observations motivate disaggregated serving and system level heterogeneity: specialized prefill and decode accelerators, broader scale up networking, and decoupled compute-memory enabled by optical I/O. We further hypothesize agent-hardware co design, multiple inference accelerators within one system, and high bandwidth, large capacity memory disaggregation as foundations for adaptation to evolving OI/CF.

In domains, such as in-car voice assistants, users often issue incomplete or ambiguous requests, creating intrinsic uncertainty that agents must manage through dialogue, tool use, and policy adherence. We introduce CAR-bench, a benchmark for evaluating consistency, uncertainty handling, and capability awareness in multi-turn, tool-using LLM agents in an in-car assistant domain. The environment features an LLM-simulated user, domain policies, and 58 interconnected tools spanning navigation, productivity, charging, and vehicle control. Beyond standard task completion, CAR-bench introduces Hallucination tasks that test agents' limit-awareness under missing tools or information, and Disambiguation tasks that require resolving uncertainty through clarification or internal information gathering. Baseline results reveal large gaps between occasional and consistent success on all task types. Even frontier reasoning LLMs achieve less than 50% consistent pass rate on Disambiguation tasks due to premature actions, and frequently violate policies or fabricate information to satisfy user requests in Hallucination tasks, underscoring the need for more reliable and self-aware LLM agents in real-world settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "CAR-bench\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9\ucc28 \uc74c\uc131 \ube44\uc11c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc911 \ud134 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc77c\uad00\uc131, \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ucc98\ub9ac \ubc0f \ub2a5\ub825 \uc778\uc2dd\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub294 \uc774\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc644\ub8cc\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uc5c8\uc73c\ub098, \uc2e4\uc81c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \uac04\uacfc\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "CAR-bench\ub294 LLM \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790, \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc815\ucc45 \ubc0f \ub0b4\ube44\uac8c\uc774\uc158, \uc0dd\uc0b0\uc131, \ucda9\uc804 \ubc0f \ucc28\ub7c9 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 58\uac1c\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc5f0\uacb0\ub41c \ub3c4\uad6c\ub4e4\uc744 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uae30\ubcf8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc720\ud615\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\ud68c\uc131 \uc131\uacf5\uacfc \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uc131\uacf5 \uac04\uc758 \ud070 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uc804\uc120 \ucd94\ub860 LLM\uc870\ucc28\ub3c4 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ud574\uacb0 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \ud1b5\uacfc\uc728\uc774 50% \ubbf8\ub9cc\uc774\uba70, \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc790\uc8fc \uc704\ubc18\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc870\uc791\ud558\uc5ec \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc694\uccad\uc744 \ucda9\uc871\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ub354 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uace0 \uc790\uae30 \uc778\uc2dd\uc774 \uc788\ub294 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub294 \uc774\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \uc124\uc815 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc644\ub8cc\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\ub098, \uc2e4\uc81c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ub300\uba74 \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \uac04\uacfc\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc790\ub3d9\ucc28 \uc74c\uc131 \ube44\uc11c\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uac00 \uc885\uc885 \ubd88\uc644\uc804\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ubaa8\ud638\ud55c \uc694\uccad\uc744 \ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ub300\ud654, \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9 \ubc0f \uc815\ucc45 \uc900\uc218\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uad00\ub9ac\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294 \ub0b4\uc7ac\uc801 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9\ucc28 \ube44\uc11c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc911 \ud134, \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc77c\uad00\uc131, \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ucc98\ub9ac \ubc0f \ub2a5\ub825 \uc778\uc2dd\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc778 CAR-bench\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud658\uacbd\uc740 LLM \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790, \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc815\ucc45 \ubc0f \ub0b4\ube44\uac8c\uc774\uc158, \uc0dd\uc0b0\uc131, \ucda9\uc804 \ubc0f \ucc28\ub7c9 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c 58\uac1c\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc5f0\uacb0\ub41c \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c\ub2e4.

Existing enterprise benchmarks evaluate surface-level agentic task completion similar to general consumer benchmarks, ignoring true challenges in enterprises, such as limited observability, large database state, and hidden workflows with cascading side effects. We introduce World of Workflows (WoW), a realistic ServiceNow-based environment incorporating 4,000+ business rules and 55 active workflows embedded in the system, alongside WoW-bench, a benchmark of 234 tasks evaluating constrained agentic task completion and enterprise dynamics modeling capabilities. We reveal two major takeaways: (1) Frontier LLMs suffer from dynamics blindness, consistently failing to predict the invisible, cascading side effects of their actions, which leads to silent constraint violations, and (2) reliability in opaque systems requires grounded world modeling, where agents must mentally simulate hidden state transitions to bridge the observability gap when high-fidelity feedback is unavailable. For reliable and useful enterprise agents, WoW motivates a new paradigm to explicitly learn system dynamics.

However, most methods still relies on sparse outcome-based reward for training. Such feedback fails to differentiate intermediate reasoning quality, leading to suboptimal training results. In this paper, we introduce Agent Reasoning Reward Model (Agent-RRM), a multi-faceted reward model that produces structured feedback for agentic trajectories, including (1) an explicit reasoning trace , (2) a focused critique that provides refinement guidance by highlighting reasoning flaws, and (3) an overall score that evaluates process performance. Leveraging these signals, we systematically investigate three integration strategies: Reagent-C (text-augmented refinement), Reagent-R (reward-augmented guidance), and Reagent-U (unified feedback integration). Extensive evaluations across 12 diverse benchmarks demonstrate that Reagent-U yields substantial performance leaps, achieving 43.7% on GAIA and 46.2% on WebWalkerQA, validating the effectiveness of our reasoning reward model and training schemes. Code, models, and datasets are all released to facilitate future research.", "AI": {"tldr": "Agentic RL\uc758 \uc131\uacfc \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubaa8\ub378\uc778 Agent-RRM\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc774 \ud76c\uadc0\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc \uae30\ubc18 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \uc911\uac04 \ucd94\ub860 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \uad6c\ubd84\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c.", "method": "Agent-RRM\uc740 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc778 \ucd94\ub860 \uc790\ucde8, \ube44\ud310\uc801 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31, \uc131\uacfc \ud3c9\uac00 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uba74\uc801\uc778 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774\ub2e4.", "result": "12\uac1c\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c Reagent-U\uac00 GAIA\uc5d0\uc11c 43.7%, WebWalkerQA\uc5d0\uc11c 46.2%\uc758 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ud6c8\ub828 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uac80\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(Agentic RL)\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ucd94\ub860\uacfc \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc131\uacf5\uc744 \uac70\ub450\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ud76c\uc18c\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc \uae30\ubc18 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc740 \uc911\uac04 \ucd94\ub860 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \uad6c\ubd84\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud574 \ucd5c\uc801 \uc774\ud558\uc758 \ud6c8\ub828 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uada4\uc801\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uba74\uc801 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubaa8\ub378\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ucd94\ub860 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubaa8\ub378(Agent-RRM)\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 (1) \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc778 \ucd94\ub860 \uc790\ucde8, (2) \ucd94\ub860 \uacb0\ud568\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uc5ec \uc138\ubd84\ud654 \uc9c0\uce68\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \uc9d1\uc911 \ube44\ud310, (3) \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uc885\ud569 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud1b5\ud569 \uc804\ub7b5\uc778 Reagent-C(\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc99d\uac15 \uac1c\uc120), Reagent-R(\ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc99d\uac15 \uc9c0\uce68), Reagent-U(\ud1b5\ud569 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \ud1b5\ud569)\ub97c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. 12\uac1c\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0 \uac78\uce5c \ud3ed\ub113\uc740 \ud3c9\uac00 \uacb0\uacfc, Reagent-U\ub294 GAIA\uc5d0\uc11c 43.7%, WebWalkerQA\uc5d0\uc11c 46.2%\uc758 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc131\uacfc \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ud6c8\ub828 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uac80\uc99d\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucf54\ub4dc\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc774 \ubaa8\ub450 \ud5a5\ud6c4 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uacf5\uac1c\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}
