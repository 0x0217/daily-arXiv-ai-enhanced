To\naddress this challenge, we highlight three critical gaps in current research:\ndata gap, model gap, and evaluation gap. To close the data gap, we introduce\nAuraGen, a controllable engine that (i) synthesizes benign trajectories, (ii)\ninjects category-labeled risks with calibrated difficulty, and (iii) filters\noutputs via an automated reward model, producing large and reliable corpora for\npre-execution safety.

However, existing methods\neither rely on projection-based techniques that enforce measurement consistency\nthrough heuristic updates, or they approximate the likelihood $p(\\boldsymbol{y}\n\\mid \\boldsymbol{x})$, often resulting in artifacts and instability under\ncomplex or high-noise conditions. To address these limitations, we propose a\nnovel framework called \\emph{coupled data and measurement space diffusion\nposterior sampling} (C-DPS), which eliminates the need for constraint tuning or\nlikelihood approximation. C-DPS introduces a forward stochastic process in the\nmeasurement space $\\{\\boldsymbol{y}_t\\}$, evolving in parallel with the\ndata-space diffusion $\\{\\boldsymbol{x}_t\\}$, which enables the derivation of a\nclosed-form posterior $p(\\boldsymbol{x}_{t-1} \\mid \\boldsymbol{x}_t,\n\\boldsymbol{y}_{t-1})$. This coupling allows for accurate and recursive\nsampling based on a well-defined posterior distribution. Empirical results\ndemonstrate that C-DPS consistently outperforms existing baselines, both\nqualitatively and quantitatively, across multiple inverse problem benchmarks."}

This\nsignificantly hinders the usefulness of such agents in environments where\ninteraction is costly (for example, when they interact with humans or reset\nphysical systems). While a number of existing LM agent architectures\nincorporate various mechanisms for experience storage and reflection, they make\nlimited use of LMs' abilities to directly generate or reason about full\ncounterfactual trajectories. We introduce ECHO (Experience Consolidation via\nHindsight Optimization), a prompting framework that adapts hindsight experience\nreplay from reinforcement learning for language model agents. ECHO generates\noptimized trajectories for alternative goals that could have been achieved\nduring failed attempts, effectively creating synthetic positive examples from\nunsuccessful interactions. Our approach consists of two components: a hindsight\nrule that uses the language model itself to identify relevant subgoals and\ngenerate optimized trajectories, and an update rule that maintains compressed\ntrajectory representations in memory. We evaluate ECHO on stateful versions of\nXMiniGrid, a text-based navigation and planning benchmark, and PeopleJoinQA, a\ncollaborative information-gathering enterprise simulation.

Existing KV retrieval methods\nmitigate this by dynamically retaining only a subset of KV entries on the GPU.\nHowever, they still suffer from notable efficiency and accuracy bottlenecks due\nto per-token retrieval and coarse-grained page-level KV management, especially\nin long-output reasoning scenarios. With the emergence of large reasoning\nmodels, efficiently handling such scenarios has become increasingly important.\nTo address this issue, we present two key observations: (1) critical KVs\nexhibit strong temporal locality during decoding, and (2) these KVs exhibit\ndistinct distribution patterns across the input prompt and generated output.\nBuilding on these observations, we propose LouisKV, an efficient KV cache\nretrieval framework designed for various long-sequence scenarios. Specifically,\nLouisKV introduces a semantic-aware retrieval strategy leveraging temporal\nlocality to trigger retrieval only at semantic boundaries, drastically reducing\ncomputation and data transfer overhead. LouisKV also designs a decoupled,\nfine-grained management scheme that tailors differentiated strategies for input\nand output sequences to create retrieval units that better match the model's\nattention patterns, enabling precise identification of critical KVs.\nFurthermore, to boost efficiency, LouisKV incorporates several kernel-level\noptimizations, including custom Triton and CUDA kernels to accelerate the KV\nclustering and retrieval. Evaluations show that LouisKV achieves up to\n4.7$\\times$ speedup over state-of-the-art KV retrieval methods while\nmaintaining near-lossless accuracy across diverse long-sequence tasks,\nincluding long-input short-output, short-input long-output, and long-input\nlong-output scenarios."}

However, many systems designed to accelerate RL post-training\nstill suffer from low resource utilization and limited scalability. We present\nROLL Flash, a system that extends ROLL with native support for asynchronous RL\npost-training. ROLL Flash is built upon two core design principles:\nfine-grained parallelism and rollout-train decoupling. Guided by these\nprinciples, ROLL Flash provides flexible programming interfaces that enable a\nfully asynchronous training architecture and support efficient rollout\nmechanisms, including queue scheduling and environment-level asynchronous\nexecution. Through comprehensive theoretical analysis and extensive\nexperiments, we demonstrate that ROLL Flash significantly improves resource\nutilization and scalability over synchronous RL post-training. ROLL Flash\nachieves up to 2.24x speedup on RLVR tasks and 2.72x on agentic tasks, using\nthe same GPU budget as synchronous baselines. Furthermore, we implement several\npopular off-policy algorithms and verify that asynchronous training can achieve\nperformance on par with synchronous training."}

Existing\nbenchmarks often lack real-world complexity and are thus unable to accurately\nassess LLMs' cybersecurity capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce\nPACEbench, a practical AI cyber-exploitation benchmark built on the principles\nof realistic vulnerability difficulty, environmental complexity, and cyber\ndefenses. Specifically, PACEbench comprises four scenarios spanning single,\nblended, chained, and defense vulnerability exploitations. To handle these\ncomplex challenges, we propose PACEagent, a novel agent that emulates human\npenetration testers by supporting multi-phase reconnaissance, analysis, and\nexploitation. Extensive experiments with seven frontier LLMs demonstrate that\ncurrent models struggle with complex cyber scenarios, and none can bypass\ndefenses. These findings suggest that current models do not yet pose a\ngeneralized cyber offense threat. Nonetheless, our work provides a robust\nbenchmark to guide the trustworthy development of future models."}
