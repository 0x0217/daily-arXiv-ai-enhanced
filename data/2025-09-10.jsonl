In typical\nwarehouse environments, agents are often sparsely distributed along aisles.\nHowever, increasing the agent density can improve space efficiency. When the\nagent density is high, we must optimize the paths not only for goal-assigned\nagents but also for those obstructing them. This study proposes a novel MAPF\nframework for high-density environments (MAPF-HD). Several studies have\nexplored MAPF in similar settings using integer linear programming (ILP).\nHowever, ILP-based methods require substantial computation time to optimize all\nagent paths simultaneously. Even in small grid-based environments with fewer\nthan $100$ cells, these computations can incur tens to hundreds of seconds.\nThese high computational costs render these methods impractical for large-scale\napplications such as automated warehouses and valet parking. To address these\nlimitations, we introduce the phased null-agent swapping (PHANS) method. PHANS\nemploys a heuristic approach to incrementally swap positions between agents and\nempty vertices. This method solves the MAPF-HD problem within seconds to tens\nof seconds, even in large environments containing more than $700$ cells. The\nproposed method can potentially improve efficiency in various real-world\napplications such as warehouse logistics, traffic management, or crowd control.\nCode is available at https://github.com/ToyotaCRDL/MAPF-in-High-Density-Envs."}

Unlike existing flat agent-based approaches that treat tools\nuniformly-often overwhelming the LLM when handling similar but subtly different\ngeospatial APIs-MapAgent decouples planning from execution.

Our work in this paper focuses on the development\nof native Autonomous Single-Agent models for DR featuring minimal web crawling\nand Python tool integration. Unlike multi-agent systems, where agents take up\npre-defined roles and are told what to do at each step in a static workflow, an\nautonomous single-agent determines its next action dynamically based on\ncontext, without manual directive. While prior work has proposed training\nrecipes for base or instruction-tuned LLMs, we focus on continual reinforcement\nlearning (RL) of reasoning-optimized models to further enhance agentic skills\nwhile preserving reasoning ability. Towards this end, we propose a simple RL\nrecipe with entirely synthetic data, which we apply to various open-source\nLLMs. Our best variant SFR-DR-20B achieves up to 28.7% on Humanity's Last Exam\nbenchmark. In addition, we conduct key analysis experiments to provide more\ninsights into our methodologies."}

The first is a novel multi-turn off-policy RL framework for\ncontinually improving the performance of LLM step-prover at training time. This\nframework, inspired by the principles of AlphaZero, utilizes a multi-stage\nexpert iteration pipeline featuring adaptive tactic-level data filtering and\nperiodic retraining to surmount the performance plateaus that typically curtail\nlong-term RL in LLM-based agents. The second innovation is a planner-enhanced\nmulti-agent search architecture that scales reasoning capabilities at inference\ntime. This architecture employs a general reasoning model as a high-level\nplanner to iteratively decompose complex theorems into a sequence of simpler\nsubgoals. This hierarchical approach substantially reduces the search space,\nenabling a team of parallel prover agents to collaborate efficiently by\nleveraging a shared proof cache. We demonstrate that this dual approach to\nscaling yields state-of-the-art results on established formal mathematics\nbenchmarks. \\texttt{BFS-Prover-V2} achieves 95.08\\% and 41.4\\% on the MiniF2F\nand ProofNet test sets respectively. While demonstrated in the domain of formal\nmathematics, the RL and inference techniques presented in this work are of\nbroader interest and may be applied to other domains requiring long-horizon\nmulti-turn reasoning and complex search."}

This approach enables online adjustment of rewards in\nresponse to positive and negative prompt augmentation, thereby reducing the\nreliance on offline reward fine-tuning. By fine-tuning the FLUX model with\noptimized denoising and online reward adjustment, we improve its\nhuman-evaluated realism and aesthetic quality by over 3x."}

With this complexity comes a greater\nrisk of security threats that can affect not just machines but real people's\nlives. To address this challenge, we present ThreatGPT, an agentic Artificial\nIntelligence (AI) assistant built to help people whether they are engineers,\nsafety officers, or policy makers to understand and analyze threats in public\nsafety systems. Instead of requiring deep cybersecurity expertise, it allows\nusers to simply describe the components of a system they are concerned about,\nsuch as login systems, data storage, or communication networks. Then, with the\nclick of a button, users can choose how they want the system to be analyzed by\nusing popular frameworks such as STRIDE, MITRE ATT&CK, CVE reports, NIST, or\nCISA. ThreatGPT is unique because it does not just provide threat information,\nbut rather it acts like a knowledgeable partner. Using few-shot learning, the\nAI learns from examples and generates relevant smart threat models. It can\nhighlight what might go wrong, how attackers could take advantage, and what can\nbe done to prevent harm. Whether securing a city's infrastructure or a local\nhealth service, this tool adapts to users' needs. In simple terms, ThreatGPT\nbrings together AI and human judgment to make our public systems safer.

The most prevalent strategies are to actively collect\ntrajectories by interacting with the environment during online training or\ntraining on offline datasets. At first glance, the nature of learning\ntask-agnostic environment dynamics makes world models a good candidate for\neffective offline training. However, the effects of online vs. offline data on\nworld models and thus on the resulting task performance have not been\nthoroughly studied in the literature. In this work, we investigate both\nparadigms in model-based settings, conducting experiments on 31 different\nenvironments. First, we showcase that online agents outperform their offline\ncounterparts. We identify a key challenge behind performance degradation of\noffline agents: encountering Out-Of-Distribution states at test time. This\nissue arises because, without the self-correction mechanism in online agents,\noffline datasets with limited state space coverage induce a mismatch between\nthe agent's imagination and real rollouts, compromising policy training. We\ndemonstrate that this issue can be mitigated by allowing for additional online\ninteractions in a fixed or adaptive schedule, restoring the performance of\nonline training with limited interaction data.
