Recent works treat large language models (LLMs) as human agents to simulate realistic mobility trajectories by modeling individual-level cognitive processes. However, these approaches generate individual mobility trajectories independently, without any population-level coordination mechanism, and thus fail to capture the emergence of collective behaviors. To address this issue, we design M2LSimu, a mobility measures-guided multi-prompt adjustment framework that leverages mobility measures derived from shared data as guidance to refine individual-level prompts for realistic mobility generation. Our framework applies coarse-grained adjustment strategies guided by mobility measures, progressively enabling fine-grained individual-level adaptation while satisfying multiple population-level mobility objectives under a limited budget. Experiments show that M2LSimu significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based methods on two public datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "M2LSimu\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc778\uac04 \uc774\ub3d9 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uac1c\uc778 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \uc870\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \uc9d1\ub2e8 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucea1\ucc98\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc778\uac04 \uc774\ub3d9 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc740 \ub3c4\uc2dc \uacfc\ud559, \uc804\uc5fc\ubcd1\ud559, \uad50\ud1b5 \ubd84\uc11d \ub4f1 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uacfc\ud559 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "M2LSimu\ub294 \uc774\ub3d9 \uce21\uc815\uac12\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uacf5\uc720 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\ub3c4\ub41c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uac1c\uc778 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, M2LSimu\ub294 \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \uacf5\uac1c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc2e0\uc758 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "M2LSimu\ub294 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc608\uc0b0 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc778\uad6c \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc774\ub3d9 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ucda9\uc871\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uac1c\ubcc4 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc815\uad50\ud55c \uc801\uc751\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc778\uac04 \uc774\ub3d9 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc740 \ub3c4\uc2dc \uacfc\ud559, \uc804\uc5fc\ubcd1\ud559 \ubc0f \uad50\ud1b5 \ubd84\uc11d\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ub9ce\uc740 \uacfc\ud559 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc \uc791\uc5c5\uc740 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \uc778\uac04 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \uac04\uc8fc\ud558\uc5ec \uac1c\ubcc4 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc778\uc9c0 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \uc774\ub3d9 \uada4\uc801\uc744 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc778\uad6c \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc870\uc815 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998 \uc5c6\uc774 \uac1c\ubcc4 \uc774\ub3d9 \uada4\uc801\uc744 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ubbc0\ub85c \uc9d1\ub2e8 \ud589\ub3d9\uc758 \ubc1c\uc0dd\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 M2LSimu\ub97c \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uacf5\uc720 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\ub3c4\ub41c \uc774\ub3d9 \uce21\uc815\uac12\uc744 \uac00\uc774\ub4dc\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \uc774\ub3d9 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uac1c\ubcc4 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \uc815\uc81c\ud558\ub294 \uc774\ub3d9 \uce21\uc815 \uc548\ub0b4 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc870\uc815 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc774\ub3d9 \uce21\uc815\uac12\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc548\ub0b4\ub418\ub294 \uc870\uc7a1\ud55c \uc870\uc815 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc608\uc0b0 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc778\uad6c \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc774\ub3d9 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ub9cc\uc871\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba74\uc11c \uc810\uc9c4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\uad50\ud55c \uac1c\ubcc4 \uc218\uc900 \uc801\uc751\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, M2LSimu\ub294 \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \uacf5\uac1c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc2e0\uc758 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc720\uc758\ubbf8\ud558\uac8c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

We argue that orchestration topology -- the structural composition of how multiple agents are coordinated, parallelized, and synthesized -- now dominates system-level performance over individual model capability. We present AdaptOrch, a formal framework for task-adaptive multi-agent orchestration that dynamically selects among four canonical topologies (parallel, sequential, hierarchical, and hybrid) based on task dependency graphs and empirically derived domain characteristics. Our framework introduces three key contributions: (1) a Performance Convergence Scaling Law, formalizing conditions under which orchestration selection outweighs model selection; (2) a Topology Routing Algorithm that maps task decomposition DAGs to optimal orchestration patterns in O(|V| + |E|) time; and (3) an Adaptive Synthesis Protocol with provable termination guarantees and heuristic consistency scoring for parallel agent outputs. We validate AdaptOrch across coding (SWE-bench), reasoning (GPQA), and retrieval-augmented generation tasks, demonstrating that topology-aware orchestration achieves 12-23% improvement over static single-topology baselines, even when using identical underlying models. Our results establish orchestration design as a first-class optimization target independent of model scaling.", "AI": {"tldr": "AdaptOrch\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8

This formulation is often ill-suited for complex multi-agent dynamics, particularly in high-frequency or irregular time-interval settings, leading to degraded performance and motivating the development of continuous-time MARL (CT-MARL). Existing CT-MARL methods are mainly built on Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations. However, they rarely account for safety constraints such as collision penalties, since these introduce discontinuities that make HJB-based learning difficult. To address this challenge, we propose a continuous-time constrained MDP (CT-CMDP) formulation and a novel MARL framework that transforms discrete MDPs into CT-CMDPs via an epigraph-based reformulation. We then solve this by proposing a novel physics-informed neural network (PINN)-based actor-critic method that enables stable and efficient optimization in continuous time.

Recent studies demonstrate that carefully designed multi-agent workflows and communication graphs can significantly improve code generation performance by leveraging collaborative reasoning. However, existing methods neither adapt topology density to task difficulty nor iteratively refine the topology within an instance using execution feedback, which leads to redundant communication and performance bottlenecks. To address these issues, we propose AgentConductor: a reinforcement learning-optimized MAS with an LLM-based orchestrator agent as its core, which enables end-to-end feedback-driven dynamic generation of interaction topologies. For each query, AgentConductor infers agent roles and task difficulty, then constructs a task-adapted, density-aware layered directed acyclic graph (DAG) topology, underpinned by two key innovations. First, we design a novel topological density function that captures communication-aware mathematical characterizations of multi-agent interactions. Second, we adopt difficulty interval partitioning to avoid excessive pruning for precise topological density upper bound measurement per difficulty level and finer-grained control. Empirically, across three competition-level and two foundational code datasets, AgentConductor achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, outperforming the strongest baseline by up to 14.6% in pass@1 accuracy, 13% in density reduction, and 68% in token cost reduction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 LLM \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc778

Recent works treat large language models (LLMs) as human agents to simulate realistic mobility behaviors using structured reasoning, but their high computational cost limits scalability. To address this, we design a mobility-aware cache framework named MobCache that leverages reconstructible caches to enable efficient large-scale human mobility simulations. It consists of: (1) a reasoning component that encodes each reasoning step as a latent-space embedding and uses a latent-space evaluator to enable the reuse and recombination of reasoning steps; and (2) a decoding component that employs a lightweight decoder trained with mobility law-constrained distillation to translate latent-space reasoning chains into natural language, thereby improving simulation efficiency while maintaining fidelity. Experiments show that MobCache significantly improves efficiency across multiple dimensions while maintaining performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLM-based methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc778\uac04 \uc774\ub3d9 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \uc704\ud55c MobCache\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc778\uac04 \uc774\ub3d9 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc740 \ub3c4\uc2dc \uacc4\ud68d, \uc804\uc5fc\ubcd1\ud559 \ubc0f \uad50\ud1b5 \ubd84\uc11d\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc751\uc6a9 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c \uc778\uc2dd \uce90\uc2dc \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c MobCache\ub97c \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uac01 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub97c \uc7a0\uc7ac \uacf5\uac04 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ud558\uace0, \uacbd\ub7c9 \ub514\ucf54\ub354\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc7a0\uc7ac \uacf5\uac04 \ucd94\ub860 \uccb4\uc778\uc744 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c4\ud589\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "MobCache\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ucc28\uc6d0\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uba70, \uae30\uc874 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "MobCache\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc778\uac04 \uc774\ub3d9 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc778\uac04 \uc774\ub3d9 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc740 \ub3c4\uc2dc \uacc4\ud68d, \uc804\uc5fc\ubcd1\ud559 \ubc0f \uad50\ud1b5 \ubd84\uc11d\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec LLM(\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378)\uc744 \uc778\uac04 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uc5ec \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \uc774\ub3d9 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud558\uc600\uc73c\ub098, \ub192\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc5d0 \uc81c\ud55c\uc774 \uc788\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uce90\uc2dc\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc778\uac04 \uc774\ub3d9 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 MobCache\ub77c\ub294 \uc774\ub3d9 \uc778\uc2dd \uce90\uc2dc \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 (1) \uac01 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub97c \uc7a0\uc7ac \uacf5\uac04 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ud558\uace0, \ucd94\ub860 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub97c \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uace0 \uc7ac\uc870\ud569\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294_latent-space evaluator\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ucd94\ub860 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\uc640 (2) \uc774\ub3d9 \ubc95\uce59 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \uc99d\ub958\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uacbd\ub7c9 \ub514\ucf54\ub354\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc7a0\uc7ac \uacf5\uac04 \ucd94\ub860 \uccb4\uc778\uc744 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ub514\ucf54\ub529 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, MobCache\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc5ec\ub7ec \ucc28\uc6d0\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uac1c\uc120\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Observational study with a predictive modeling approach using a cross-sectional design, aimed at estimating the chances of developing dementia, using data from the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSI-Brazil), involving 9,412 participants. Dementia was determined based on neuropsychological assessment and informant-based cognitive function. Analyses were performed using Random Forest (RF) and multivariable logistic regression to estimate the risk of dementia in the middle-aged and elderly populations of Brazil. The prevalence of dementia was 9.6%. The highest odds of dementia were observed in illiterate individuals (Odds Ratio (OR) = 7.42), individuals aged 90 years or older (OR = 11.00), low weight (OR = 2.11), low handgrip strength (OR = 2.50), self-reported black skin color (OR = 1.47), physical inactivity (OR = 1.61), self-reported hearing loss (OR = 1.65), and presence of depressive symptoms (OR = 1.72). Higher education (OR=0.44), greater life satisfaction (OR=0.72), and being employed (OR=0.78) were protective factors. The RF model outperformed logistic regression, achieving an area under the ROC curve of 0.776, with a sensitivity of 0.708, a specificity of 0.702, an F1-score of 0.311, a G-means of 0.705, and an accuracy of 0.703.

We model agents as possessing pretrained policies with distinct strategic characteristics (e.g., competitive, naively cooperative, robustly collusive), and formulate the problem as selecting a meta-strategy that combines a pretrained, initial policy with an in-game adaptation rule. We seek to examine whether collusion can emerge under rational choices and how agents co-adapt toward cooperation or competition. To this end, we sample normal-form empirical games over meta-strategy profiles, % across random initial game states, compute relevant game statistics (e.g., payoffs against individuals and regret against an equilibrium mixture of opponents), and construct empirical best-response graphs to uncover strategic relationships. We evaluate both reinforcement-learning and LLM-based strategies in repeated pricing games under symmetric and asymmetric cost settings, and present findings on the feasibility of algorithmic collusion and the effectiveness of pricing strategies in practical ``test-time'' environments.\n  The source code and the full paper with appendix are available at:

They are known to severely degrade performance, and the convergence rate under delayed feedback is still unclear, even for bilinear games. This paper derives the rate of linear convergence of Weighted Optimistic Gradient Descent-Ascent (WOGDA), which predicts future rewards with extra optimism, in unconstrained bilinear games. To analyze the algorithm, we interpret it as an approximation of the Extra Proximal Point (EPP), which is updated based on farther future rewards than the classical Proximal Point (PP). Our theorems show that standard optimism (predicting the next-step reward) achieves linear convergence to the equilibrium at a rate $\\exp(-\u0398(t/m^{5}))$ after $t$ iterations for delay $m$. Moreover, employing extra optimism (predicting farther future reward) tolerates a larger step size and significantly accelerates the rate to $\\exp(-\u0398(t/(m^{2}\\log m)))$. Our experiments also show accelerated convergence driven by the extra optimism and are qualitatively consistent with our theorems.

Unlike disembodied AI, failures in embodied intelligence lead to irreversible physical consequences, raising fundamental questions about security, safety, and reliability. While existing research predominantly analyzes embodied AI through the lenses of Large Language Model (LLM) vulnerabilities or classical Cyber-Physical System (CPS) failures, this survey argues that these perspectives are individually insufficient to explain many observed breakdowns in modern embodied systems. We posit that a significant class of failures arises from embodiment-induced system-level mismatches, rather than from isolated model flaws or traditional CPS attacks. Specifically, we identify four core insights that explain why embodied AI is fundamentally harder to secure: (i) semantic correctness does not imply physical safety, as language-level reasoning abstracts away geometry, dynamics, and contact constraints; (ii) identical actions can lead to drastically different outcomes across physical states due to nonlinear dynamics and state uncertainty; (iii) small errors propagate and amplify across tightly coupled perception-decision-action loops; and (iv) safety is not compositional across time or system layers, enabling locally safe decisions to accumulate into globally unsafe behavior. These insights suggest that securing embodied AI requires moving beyond component-level defenses toward system-level reasoning about physical risk, uncertainty, and failure propagation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uccb4\ud654\ub41c AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc548\uc804\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc2e4\uc81c \ud658\uacbd\uc73c\ub85c \ube60\ub974\uac8c \uc9c4\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ubcf4\uc548, \uc548\uc804\uc131 \ubc0f \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc774 \uc81c\uae30\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uccb4\ud654\ub41c AI\uc758 \uace0\uc720\ud55c \uc2e4\ud328 \ubc0f \ubcf4\uc548 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uccb4\ud654\ub41c AI\uc758 \uc2e4\ud328\ub97c \ubaa8\ub378 \uacb0\ud568\uc774\ub098 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 CPS \uacf5\uaca9\uc774 \uc544\ub2cc \uccb4\ud654\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc778\ud55c \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud575\uc2ec \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uccb4\ud654\ub41c AI\ub294 \ubcf4\uc548\uc774 \ub354 \uc5b4\ub835\ub2e4\ub294 \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc774\uc720: \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc801 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc774 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc548\uc804\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc74c, \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9\uc774 \ube44\uc120\ud615 \ub3d9\ub825\ud559\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ub2e4\ub978 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud568, \uc791\uc740 \uc624\ub958\uc758 \uc804\ud30c\uc640 \uc99d\ud3ed, \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc774 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \ub610\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uacc4\uce35\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\ud569\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc74c.", "conclusion": "\uccb4\ud654\ub41c AI \ubcf4\uc548\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c \uc218\uc900 \ubc29\uc5b4\ub97c \ub118\uc5b4\uc11c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc704\ud5d8, \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ubc0f \uc2e4\ud328 \uc804\ud30c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0ac\uace0\ub85c \ub098\uc544\uac00\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uccb4\ud654\ub41c AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(\uc608: \uc790\uc728\uc8fc\ud589\ucc28, \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \ub85c\ubd07 \ubc0f LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8)\uc740 \ud1b5\uc81c\ub41c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc548\uc804\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc2e4\uc81c \ubc30\uce58\ub85c \ube60\ub974\uac8c \uc804\ud658\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud574\uccb4\ub41c AI\uc640 \ub2ec\ub9ac, \uccb4\ud654\ub41c \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc758 \uc2e4\ud328\ub294 \ub3cc\uc774\ud0ac \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf4\uc548, \uc548\uc804\uc131 \ubc0f \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \uc81c\uae30\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc8fc\ub85c \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc774\ub098 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubb3c\ub9ac \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(CPS) \uc2e4\ud328\uc758 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \uccb4\ud654\ub41c AI\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubcf8 \uc124\ubb38\uc870\uc0ac\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uad00\uc810\uc774 \ud604\ub300 \uccb4\ud654 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uad00\ucc30\ub41c \ub9ce\uc740 \ubd84\ud574\ub97c \uc124\uba85\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uac1c\ubcc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd88\ucda9\ubd84\ud558\ub2e4\uace0 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc2e4\ud328\uac00 \ubaa8\ub378 \uacb0\ud568\uc774\ub098 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 CPS \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uccb4\ud654\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \uac00\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uccb4\ud654\ub41c AI\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548\uc744 \uc5b4\ub835\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud575\uc2ec \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: (i) \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc801 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc774 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc548\uc804\uc744 \uc758\ubbf8\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba70, \uc5b8\uc5b4 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ucd94\ub860\uc740 \uae30\ud558\ud559, \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559 \ubc0f \uc811\ucd09 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4;

To improve time-to-result and analysis efficiency, NeuDiff Agent is introduced as a governed, tool-using AI workflow for TOPAZ at the Spallation Neutron Source that takes instrument data products through reduction, integration, refinement, and validation to a validated crystal structure and a publication-ready CIF. NeuDiff Agent executes this established pipeline under explicit governance by restricting actions to allowlisted tools, enforcing fail-closed verification gates at key workflow boundaries, and capturing complete provenance for inspection, auditing, and controlled replay. Performance is assessed using a fixed prompt protocol and repeated end-to-end runs with two large language model backends, with user and machine time partitioned and intervention burden and recovery behaviors quantified under gating. In a reference-case benchmark, NeuDiff Agent reduces wall time from 435 minutes (manual) to 86.5(4.7) to 94.4(3.5) minutes (4.6-5.0x faster) while producing a validated CIF with no checkCIF level A or B alerts.

In addition, ONNX is an open-source, portable format, which makes it easy to share and deploy models across different frameworks, hardware platforms, and runtime environments without requiring framework-specific conversions.\n  Our lookup arguments, which use sumcheck protocol, are well-suited for non-linear functions -- key building blocks in modern ML. We apply optimisations such as neural teleportation to reduce the size of lookup tables while preserving model accuracy, as well as several tensor-level verification optimisations detailed in this paper. We demonstrate that Jolt Atlas can prove model inference in memory-constrained environments -- a prover property commonly referred to as \\textit{streaming}. Furthermore, we discuss how Jolt Atlas achieves zero-knowledge through the BlindFold technique, as introduced in Vega. In contrast to existing zkML frameworks, we show practical proving times for classification, embedding, automated reasoning, and small language models.\n  Jolt Atlas enables cryptographic verification that can be run on-device, without specialised hardware. The resulting proofs are succinctly verifiable. This makes Jolt Atlas well-suited for privacy-centric and adversarial environments. In a companion work, we outline various use cases of Jolt Atlas, including how it serves as guardrails in agentic commerce and for trustless AI context (often referred to as \\textit{AI memory}).", "AI": {"tldr": "Jolt Atlas\ub294 \uc81c\ub85c \uc9c0\uc2dd \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, Jolt \uc99d\uba85 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378 \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0 \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uba70, ONNX \ud150\uc11c \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uc811 \uc801\uc6a9\ub41c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc81c\uc57d\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \ubaa8\ub378 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, Jolt Atlas\ub294 \uc554\ud638\ud654 \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \uc801\ud569\ud558\ub2e4.", "motivation": "Jolt Atlas\ub294 \uc81c\ub85c \uc9c0\uc2dd \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378 \ucd94\ub860 \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud65c\uc6a9\uc744 \ubaa9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "Jolt\uc758 \uc870\ud68c \uc911\uc2ec \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 ONNX \ud150\uc11c \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uace0, sumcheck \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc870\ud68c \uc778\uc218\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ube44\uc120\ud615 \ud568\uc218\uc5d0 \uc801\ud569\ud558\uac8c \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc870\ud68c \ud14c\uc774\ube14\uc758 \ud06c\uae30\ub97c \uc904\uc774\ub294 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "Jolt Atlas\ub294 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc81c\uc57d\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \ubaa8\ub378 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc2e0\uc18d\ud558\uac8c \uc99d\uba85\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uc99d\uba85 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Jolt Atlas\ub294 \ud2b9\ubcc4\ud55c \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 \uc7a5\uce58\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc554\ud638\ud654 \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc801\ud569\ud558\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "Jolt Atlas\ub294 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5(zkML) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, Jolt \uc99d\uba85 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378 \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0 \ud655\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

GUI-Owl-1.5 achieves state-of-the-art results on more than 20+ GUI benchmarks on open-source models: (1) on GUI automation tasks, it obtains 56.5 on OSWorld, 71.6 on AndroidWorld, and 48.4 on WebArena; (2) on grounding tasks, it obtains 80.3 on ScreenSpotPro; (3) on tool-calling tasks, it obtains 47.6 on OSWorld-MCP, and 46.8 on MobileWorld; (4) on memory and knowledge tasks, it obtains 75.5 on GUI-Knowledge Bench. GUI-Owl-1.5 incorporates several key innovations: (1) Hybird Data Flywheel: we construct the data pipeline for UI understanding and trajectory generation based on a combination of simulated environments and cloud-based sandbox environments, in order to improve the efficiency and quality of data collection. (2) Unified Enhancement of Agent Capabilities: we use a unified thought-synthesis pipeline to enhance the model's reasoning capabilities, while placing particular emphasis on improving key agent abilities, including Tool/MCP use, memory and multi-agent adaptation; (3) Multi-platform Environment RL Scaling: We propose a new environment RL algorithm, MRPO, to address the challenges of multi-platform conflicts and the low training efficiency of long-horizon tasks.

OpenSage offers effective functionality for agents to create and manage their own sub-agents and toolkits. It also features a hierarchical, graph-based memory system for efficient management and a specialized toolkit tailored to software engineering tasks. Extensive experiments across three state-of-the-art benchmarks with various backbone models demonstrate the advantages of OpenSage over existing ADKs. We also conduct rigorous ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of our design for each component. We believe OpenSage can pave the way for the next generation of agent development, shifting the focus from human-centered to AI-centered paradigms.", "AI": {"tldr": "OpenSage\ub294 LLM\uc774 \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 ADK\ub85c, \uc790\uac00 \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \ud1a0\ud3f4\ub85c\uc9c0\uc640 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc9c0\uc6d0\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac1c\ubc1c \ud0a4\ud2b8\ub294 \uae30\ub2a5 \uc9c0\uc6d0\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc218\ub3d9 \uc124\uacc4\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ubc0f \uc804\uccb4\uc801\uc778 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "OpenSage\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \ud558\uc704 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubc0f \ub3c4\uad6c \ud0a4\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uad00\ub9ac\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \ud6a8\uc728\uc801 \uad00\ub9ac\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uae30\ubc18 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uacfc \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uacf5\ud559 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucd98 \uc804\ubb38 \ub3c4\uad6c \ud0a4\ud2b8\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc640 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubc31\ubcf8 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 OpenSage\uc758 \uc7a5\uc810\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud558\ub294 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "OpenSage\ub294 \uc778\uac04 \uc911\uc2ec\uc5d0\uc11c AI \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784 \uc804\ud658\uc744 \uc774\ub04c\uc5b4\ub0b4\uba70 \ucc28\uc138\ub300 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc758 \uae38\uc744 \uc5f4\uc5b4\uc904 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ubbff\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac1c\ubc1c \ud0a4\ud2b8(ADK)\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uacfc \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uadf8 \uc124\uacc4\ub294 \uad6c\ucd95\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5, \ud2b9\ud788 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud1a0\ud3f4\ub85c\uc9c0, \ub3c4\uad6c \ubc0f \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uae30\ub2a5\uc5d0 \uc911\ub300\ud55c \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce69\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 ADK\ub294 \ucda9\ubd84\ud55c \uae30\ub2a5 \uc9c0\uc6d0\uc774 \uc5c6\uac70\ub098 \uc778\uac04\uc774 \uc218\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \uc124\uacc4\ud574\uc57c \ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ubc0f \uc804\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 LLM\uc774 \uc790\uac00 \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \ud1a0\ud3f4\ub85c\uc9c0\uc640 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 ADK\uc778 OpenSage\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Safety evaluations, however, overwhelmingly measure text-level refusal behavior, leaving a critical question unanswered: does alignment that suppresses harmful text also suppress harmful actions? We introduce the GAP benchmark, a systematic evaluation framework that measures divergence between text-level safety and tool-call-level safety in LLM agents. We test six frontier models across six regulated domains (pharmaceutical, financial, educational, employment, legal, and infrastructure), seven jailbreak scenarios per domain, three system prompt conditions (neutral, safety-reinforced, and tool-encouraging), and two prompt variants, producing 17,420 analysis-ready datapoints. Our central finding is that text safety does not transfer to tool-call safety. Across all six models, we observe instances where the model's text output refuses a harmful request while its tool calls simultaneously execute the forbidden action--a divergence we formalize as the GAP metric. Even under safety-reinforced system prompts, 219 such cases persist across all six models. System prompt wording exerts substantial influence on tool-call behavior: TC-safe rates span 21 percentage points for the most robust model and 57 for the most prompt-sensitive, with 16 of 18 pairwise ablation comparisons remaining significant after Bonferroni correction. Runtime governance contracts reduce information leakage in all six models but produce no detectable deterrent effect on forbidden tool-call attempts themselves. These results demonstrate that text-only safety evaluations are insufficient for assessing agent behavior and that tool-call safety requires dedicated measurement and mitigation.", "AI": {"tldr":

However, existing methods struggle to generate multiple high-quality explanations that (1) affect only a small portion of the features, (2) can be applied to tabular data with heterogeneous features, and (3) are consistent with the user-defined constraints. We propose CounterFlowNet, a generative approach that formulates CF generation as sequential feature modification using conditional Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNet). CounterFlowNet is trained to sample CFs proportionally to a user-specified reward function that can encode key CF desiderata: validity, sparsity, proximity and plausibility, encouraging high-quality explanations. The sequential formulation yields highly sparse edits, while a unified action space seamlessly supports continuous and categorical features. Moreover, actionability constraints, such as immutability and monotonicity of features, can be enforced at inference time via action masking, without retraining. Experiments on eight datasets under two evaluation protocols demonstrate that CounterFlowNet achieves superior trade-offs between validity, sparsity, plausibility, and diversity with full satisfaction of the given constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "CounterFlowNet\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ubc18\uc0ac\uc2e4\uc801 \uc124\uba85 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubc18\uc0ac\uc2e4\uc801 \uc124\uba85 \uae30\ubc95\uc740 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uac00 \uc815\uc758\ud55c \uc81c\uc57d \uc870\uac74\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uace0\ud488\uc9c8\uc758 \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc870\uac74\ubd80 \uc0dd\uc131 \ud750\ub984 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ud2b9\uc9d5 \uc218\uc815\uc758 \uc21c\ucc28\uc801 \ud615\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \ubc18\uc0ac\uc2e4\uc801 \uc124\uba85 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\ub294 CounterFlowNet\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "CounterFlowNet\uc740 \uc8fc\uc5b4\uc9c4 \uc81c\uc57d \uc870\uac74\uc744 \uc644\uc804\ud788 \ub9cc\uc871\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba74\uc11c \uc720\ud6a8\uc131, \ud76c\uc18c\uc131, \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \ubc0f \ub2e4\uc591\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "CounterFlowNet\uc740 \ud76c\uc18c\ud55c \ud3b8\uc9d1\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uba70, \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc758 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \uc81c\uc57d \uc870\uac74\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubc18\uc0ac\uc2e4\uc801 \uc124\uba85(CF)\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \ubcc0\uacbd\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc785\ub825 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc758 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud55c\uc758 \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc778\uac04\uc774 \ud574\uc11d\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 (1) \uc791\uc740 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc758 \uc77c\ubd80\ub9cc \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\uace0, (2) \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \uac16\ub294 \ud45c \ud615\uc2dd \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, (3) \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc815\uc758 \uc81c\uc57d \uc870\uac74\uacfc \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc21c\ucc28\uc801 \ud2b9\uc9d5 \uc218\uc815\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec CF \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc0dd\uc131\uc801 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc778 CounterFlowNet\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

We model this constrained, evolving availability using random graph processes, where arms are nodes and the agent's movement is restricted to its local neighborhood. We analyze this problem under two random graph models: an i.i.d. Erd\u0151s--R\u00e9nyi (ER) process and an Edge-Markovian process. We propose and analyze a two-phase algorithm that employs a lazy random walk for exploration to efficiently identify the optimal arm, followed by a navigation and commitment phase for exploitation.

Temporal credit assignment mitigates this issue by transforming sparse feedback into dense supervision signals. However, previous approaches typically depend on learning task-specific value functions for credit assignment, which suffer from poor sample efficiency and limited generalization. In this work, we propose to leverage pretrained knowledge from large language models (LLMs) to transform sparse rewards into dense training signals (i.e., the advantage function) through retrospective in-context learning (RICL). We further propose an online learning framework, RICOL, which iteratively refines the policy based on the credit assignment results from RICL. We empirically demonstrate that RICL can accurately estimate the advantage function with limited samples and effectively identify critical states in the environment for temporal credit assignment. Extended evaluation on four BabyAI scenarios show that RICOL achieves comparable convergent performance with traditional online RL algorithms with significantly higher sample efficiency. Our findings highlight the potential of leveraging LLMs for temporal credit assignment, paving the way for more sample-efficient and generalizable RL paradigms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud76c\uc18c\ud55c \ud658\uacbd \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc790\uae30 \uc9c4\ud654 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\ub294 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uccb4 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \ud76c\uc18c\ud55c \ud658\uacbd \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud76c\uc18c\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 Dense\ud55c \ud6c8\ub828 \uc2e0\ud638(\uc989, \uc774\uc810 \ud568\uc218)\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c RICL(\ud68c\uace0\uc801 \ub9e5\ub77d \ud559\uc2b5)\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uad6c\ud604\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, RICO(L)\ub77c\ub294 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec RICL\uc758 \uc2e0\uc6a9 \ud560\ub2f9 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac1c\uc120\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "RICL\uc740 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc0d8\ud50c\ub85c \uc774\uc810 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \ucd94\uc815\ud558\uace0 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc720\uc6a9\ud568\uc744 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, a key limitation of traditional MoE is its token-level routing, where the router assigns each token to specialized experts, which fragments phase-consistent patterns into scattered expert assignments and thus undermines expert specialization. In this paper, we propose \\textbf{Phase-Aware Mixture of Experts (PA-MoE)}. It first features a lightweight \\emph{phase router} that learns latent phase boundaries directly from the RL objective without pre-defining phase categories. Then, the phase router allocates temporally consistent assignments to the same expert, allowing experts to preserve phase-specific expertise. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed PA-MoE.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uae30\uc874 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc815\ucc45 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud574 \ub2e8\uc21c \uc791\uc5c5\uc774 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \ucc28\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ucda9\ubd84\ud55c \uc6a9\ub7c9\uc744 \ub0a8\uae30\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 Mixture-of-Experts(MoE) \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud574 \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \uc9c0\ubc30\ub97c \ubc29\uc9c0\ud558\uace0, Phase-Aware Mixture of Experts(PA-MoE)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc758 \uc804\ubb38\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc774 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc815\ucc45 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e8\uc21c \uc791\uc5c5\uc774 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\uc758 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc744 \ucc28\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "Phase-Aware Mixture of Experts(PA-MoE)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \uacbd\ub7c9\uc758 phase router\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c1\uc811 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \ub2e8\uacc4 \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "PA-MoE\uac00 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc758 \uc804\ubb38\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ud568\uaed8 \ud560\ub2f9\uc744 \ud574\uc904 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c PA-MoE\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc740 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubd80\uc5ec\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874\uc758 RL \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ubcf4\ud1b5 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc815\ucc45 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e8\uc21c \uc791\uc5c5\uc774 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \ucc28\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \uacbd\ub7c9 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \uc9c0\ubc30\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ucda9\ubd84\ud55c \uc6a9\ub7c9\uc744 \ub0a8\uae30\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc740 \uc815\ucc45 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0 Mixture-of-Experts(MoE) \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.

ITR composes a dynamic runtime system prompt and exposes a narrowed toolset with confidence-gated fallbacks. Using a controlled benchmark with internally consistent numbers, ITR reduces per-step context tokens by 95%, improves correct tool routing by 32% relative, and cuts end-to-end episode cost by 70% versus a monolithic baseline. These savings enable agents to run 2-20x more loops within context limits. Savings compound with the number of agent steps, making ITR particularly valuable for long-running autonomous agents.

Existing approaches, from RL-based planners to trajectory retrieval, often drift from user intent and repeatedly solve routine subproblems, leading to error accumulation and inefficiency. We present IntentCUA, a multi-agent computer-use framework designed to stabilize long-horizon execution through intent-aligned plan memory. A Planner, Plan-Optimizer, and Critic coordinate over shared memory that abstracts raw interaction traces into multi-view intent representations and reusable skills. At runtime, intent prototypes retrieve subgroup-aligned skills and inject them into partial plans, reducing redundant re-planning and mitigating error propagation across desktop applications. In end-to-end evaluations, IntentCUA achieved a 74.83% task success rate with a Step Efficiency Ratio of 0.91, outperforming RL-based and trajectory-centric baselines. Ablations show that multi-view intent abstraction and shared plan memory jointly improve execution stability, with the cooperative multi-agent loop providing the largest gains on long-horizon tasks. These results highlight that system-level intent abstraction and memory-grounded coordination are key to reliable and efficient desktop automation in large, dynamic environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "IntentCUA\ub294 \uc758\ub3c4 \uc815\ub82c \uacc4\ud68d \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uae34 \uc2dc\uac04 \ub3d9\uc548\uc758 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud130 \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uc2e4\ud589\uc744 \uc548\uc815\ud654\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc758\ub3c4\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc97\uc5b4\uc9c0\uba70, \uc8fc\uae30\uc801\uc778 \ud558\uc704 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uadf8\uccd0 \uc624\ub958 \ucd95\uc801\uacfc \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "Planner, Plan-Optimizer \ubc0f Critic\uc774 \uacf5\uc720 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud611\ub825\ud558\uc5ec \uc6d0\uc2dc \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ud754\uc801\uc744 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubcf4\uae30 \uc758\ub3c4 \ud45c\ud604 \ubc0f \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uae30\uc220\ub85c \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "IntentCUA\ub294 74.83%\uc758 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uacfc 0.91\uc758 \ub2e8\uacc4 \ud6a8\uc728 \ube44\uc728\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc5ec RL \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc \uada4\uc801 \uc911\uc2ec \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc758\ub3c4 \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654\uc640 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc870\uc815\uc774 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uace0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ub370\uc2a4\ud06c\ud0d1 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc784\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucef4\ud4e8\ud130 \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc18c\uc74c \uc778\uc2dd, \ub2e4\uc911 \ucc3d \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8, \ubcc0\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ud658\uacbd \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0\uc11c \uae34 \uc2dc\uac04 \ub3d9\uc548 \uc791\ub3d9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 RL \uae30\ubc18 \uacc4\ud68d\uc790\uc5d0\uc11c \uada4\uc801 \uac80\uc0c9\uc5d0 \uc774\ub974\uae30\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc758\ub3c4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc885\uc885 \ubc97\uc5b4\ub098\uace0 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc77c\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \ud558\uc704 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uc5ec \uc624\ub958 \ucd95\uc801\uacfc \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc758\ub3c4 \uc815\ub82c \uacc4\ud68d \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uae34 \uc218\ud3c9 \uc2e4\ud589\uc744 \uc548\uc815\ud654\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud130 \uc0ac\uc6a9 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 IntentCUA\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacc4\ud68d\uc790, \uacc4\ud68d \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uae30 \ubc0f \ube44\ud3c9\uac00\uac00 \uacf5\uc720 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\uc5d0\uc11c \ud611\uc870\ud558\uc5ec \uc6d0\uc2dc \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ud754\uc801\uc744 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubcf4\uae30 \uc758\ub3c4 \ud45c\ud604 \ubc0f \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uae30\uc220\ub85c \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud589 \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \uc758\ub3c4 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ud0c0\uc785\uc774 \ud558\uc704 \uadf8\ub8f9 \uc815\ub82c \uae30\uc220\uc744 \uac80\uc0c9\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \ubd80\ubd84 \uacc4\ud68d\uc5d0 \uc0bd\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc911\ubcf5 \uc7ac\uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uace0 \ub370\uc2a4\ud06c\ud0d1 \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158 \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc624\ub958 \uc804\ud30c\ub97c \uc644\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc885\ub2e8 \uac04 \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0\uc11c IntentCUA\ub294 74.83%\uc758 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uacfc 0.91\uc758 \ub2e8\uacc4 \ud6a8\uc728 \ube44\uc728\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc5ec RL \uae30\ubc18 \ubc0f \uada4\uc801 \uc911\uc2ec \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc808\ub2e8 \ubd84\uc11d \uacb0\uacfc \ub2e4\uc911 \ubcf4\uae30 \uc758\ub3c4 \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654\uc640 \uacf5\uc720 \uacc4\ud68d \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\uac00 \uacf5\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc2e4\ud589 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0 \ud611\ub825\uc801\uc778 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ub8e8\ud504\uac00 \uae34 \uc218\ud3c9 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uac00\uc7a5 \ud070 \uc774\ub4dd\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc758\ub3c4 \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654\uc640 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uc870\uc815\uc774 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub3d9\uc801 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uace0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ub370\uc2a4\ud06c\ud0d1 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec\uc784\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

With full Internet access, our agent can re-identify Hacker News users and Anthropic Interviewer participants at high precision, given pseudonymous online profiles and conversations alone, matching what would take hours for a dedicated human investigator. We then design attacks for the closed-world setting. Given two databases of pseudonymous individuals, each containing unstructured text written by or about that individual, we implement a scalable attack pipeline that uses LLMs to: (1) extract identity-relevant features, (2) search for candidate matches via semantic embeddings, and (3) reason over top candidates to verify matches and reduce false positives. Compared to prior deanonymization work (e.g., on the Netflix prize) that required structured data or manual feature engineering, our approach works directly on raw user content across arbitrary platforms. We construct three datasets with known ground-truth data to evaluate our attacks. The first links Hacker News to LinkedIn profiles, using cross-platform references that appear in the profiles. Our second dataset matches users across Reddit movie discussion communities; and the third splits a single user's Reddit history in time to create two pseudonymous profiles to be matched. In each setting, LLM-based methods substantially outperform classical baselines, achieving up to 68% recall at 90% precision compared to near 0% for the best non-LLM method. Our results show that the practical obscurity protecting pseudonymous users online no longer holds and that threat models for online privacy need to be reconsidered.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\ud615

However, how these agents differ in their pull request description characteristics, and how human reviewers respond to them, remains underexplored. In this study, we conduct an empirical analysis of pull requests created by five AI coding agents using the AIDev dataset. We analyze agent differences in pull request description characteristics, including structural features, and examine human reviewer response in terms of review activity, response timing, sentiment, and merge outcomes. We find that AI coding agents exhibit distinct PR description styles, which are associated with differences in reviewer engagement, response time, and merge outcomes. We observe notable variation across agents in both reviewer interaction metrics and merge rates. These findings highlight the role of pull request presentation and reviewer interaction dynamics in human-AI collaborative software development.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI \ucf54\ub529 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 GitHub\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ud480 \ub9ac\ud018\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc124\uba85 \ud2b9\uc131\uacfc \uc778\uac04 \ub9ac\ubdf0\uc5b4\uc758 \ubc18\uc751 \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud588\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AI \ucf54\ub529 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ud480 \ub9ac\ud018\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc758 \ud2b9\uc131 \ucc28\uc774\uc640 \uc778\uac04 \ub9ac\ubdf0\uc5b4\uc758 \ubc18\uc751\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud568\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "AIDev \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec 5\uac1c\uc758 AI \ucf54\ub529 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c \ud480 \ub9ac\ud018\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \uc2e4\uc99d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "AI \ucf54\ub529 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ub3c5\ud2b9\ud55c PR \uc124\uba85 \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ub9ac\ubdf0\uc5b4\uc758 \ucc38\uc5ec\ub3c4, \ubc18\uc751 \uc2dc\uac04, \ubcd1\ud569 \uacb0\uacfc\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce5c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ud480 \ub9ac\ud018\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc758 \ubc1c\ud45c \ubc29\uc2dd\uacfc \ub9ac\ubdf0\uc5b4 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uc5ed\ud559\uc774 \uc778\uac04-AI \ud611\uc5c5 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ube60\ub978 \ucc44\ud0dd\uc740 GitHub\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud480 \ub9ac\ud018\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 AI \ucf54\ub529 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ucd9c\ud604\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc84c\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ud480 \ub9ac\ud018\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc124\uba85 \ud2b9\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ub2e4\ub978\uc9c0, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uc778\uac04 \ub9ac\ubdf0\uc5b4\uac00 \uc774\ub97c \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ubc18\uc751\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\ub294 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \ud0d0\uad6c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 AIDev \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec 5\uac1c\uc758 AI \ucf54\ub529 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c \ud480 \ub9ac\ud018\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\uc99d \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ud480 \ub9ac\ud018\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc124\uba85 \ud2b9\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0, \ub9ac\ubdf0 \ud65c\ub3d9, \ubc18\uc751 \uc2dc\uac04, \uac10\uc815 \ubc0f \ubcd1\ud569 \uacb0\uacfc \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uac04 \ub9ac\ubdf0\uc5b4\uc758 \ubc18\uc751\uc744 \uac80\ud1a0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Many proposed code evolution pipelines show impressive performance but are often not compared to simpler baselines. We test how well two simple baselines do over three domains: finding better mathematical bounds, designing agentic scaffolds, and machine learning competitions. We find that simple baselines match or exceed much more sophisticated methods in all three. By analyzing these results we find various shortcomings in how code evolution is both developed and used. For the mathematical bounds, a problem's search space and domain knowledge in the prompt are chiefly what dictate a search's performance ceiling and efficiency, with the code evolution pipeline being secondary. Thus, the primary challenge in finding improved bounds is designing good search spaces, which is done by domain experts, and not the search itself. When designing agentic scaffolds we find that high variance in the scaffolds coupled with small datasets leads to suboptimal scaffolds being selected, resulting in hand-designed majority vote scaffolds performing best. We propose better evaluation methods that reduce evaluation stochasticity while keeping the code evolution economically feasible. We finish with a discussion of avenues and best practices to enable more rigorous code evolution in future work.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ucf54\ub4dc \uc9c4\ud654\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4

User requirements are no longer captured by a single metric (e.g., throughput or reliability), but by multi-dimensional objectives such as latency sensitivity, energy preference, computational constraints, and service-level requirements. These objectives may also change over time due to environmental dynamics and user-network interactions. Therefore, accurate understanding of both the communication environment and user intent is critical for autonomous and sustainably evolving 6G communications.\n  Large language models (LLMs), with strong contextual understanding and cross-modal reasoning, provide a promising foundation for intent-aware network agents. Compared with rule-driven or centrally optimized designs, LLM-based agents can integrate heterogeneous information and translate natural-language intents into executable control and configuration decisions.\n  Focusing on a closed-loop pipeline of intent perception, autonomous decision making, and network execution, this paper investigates agentic AI for the 6G physical layer and its realization pathways. We review representative physical-layer tasks and their limitations in supporting intent awareness and autonomy, identify application scenarios where agentic AI is advantageous, and discuss key challenges and enabling technologies in multimodal perception, cross-layer decision making, and sustainable optimization. Finally, we present a case study of an intent-driven link decision agent, termed AgenCom, which adaptively constructs communication links under diverse user preferences and channel conditions.", "AI":

High-coverage hardware verification exemplifies this challenge due to its reliance on industrial simulators and non-differentiable execution signals. We propose LLM4Cov, an offline agent-learning framework that models verification as memoryless state transitions guided by deterministic evaluators. Building on this formulation, we introduce execution-validated data curation, policy-aware agentic data synthesis, and worst-state-prioritized sampling to enable scalable learning under execution constraints. We further curate a reality-aligned benchmark adapted from an existing verification suite through a revised evaluation protocol. Using the proposed pipeline, a compact 4B-parameter model achieves 69.2% coverage pass rate under agentic evaluation, outperforming its teacher by 5.3% and demonstrating competitive performance against models an order of magnitude larger.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM4Cov\ub294 \uc2e4\ud589 \uc81c\uc57d \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ub3c4\uad6c \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \uc5bb\ub294 \uacfc\uc815\uc774 \ube44\uc308\uacfc \ub290\ub9b0 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc774 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc5c6\ub294 \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc804\uc774\ub85c \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 LLM4Cov\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uacb0\uc815\ub860\uc801 \ud3c9\uac00\uc790\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc548\ub0b4\ub41c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ud55c \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u0430\u043a\u0442\ud55c 4B-\ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0\uc11c 69.2%\uc758 \ucee4\ubc84\ub9ac\uc9c0 \ud569\uaca9\ub960\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc2a4\uc2b9 \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 5.3% \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc774 \ub354 \ud070 \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uacfc \uacbd\uc7c1\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc2e4\ud589 \uc778\uc2dd \uae30\ubc18 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ub3c4\uad6c \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \ube44\uc2f8\uace0 \uc5bb\uae30 \ub290\ub824 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc744 \ube44\ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub9cc\ub4e0\ub2e4. \ub192\uc740 \ucee4\ubc84\ub9ac\uc9c0 \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uac80\uc99d\uc740 \uc0b0\uc5c5 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\ud130\uc640 \ube44\ubd84\ud654 \uc2e4\ud589 \uc2e0\ud638\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc774 \ub3c4\uc804\uc758 \ub300\ud45c\uc801\uc778 \uc608\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uacb0\uc815\ub860\uc801 \ud3c9\uac00\uc790\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc548\ub0b4\ub41c \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc5c6\ub294 \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc804\uc774\ub85c \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 LLM4Cov\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc2e4\ud589 \uc81c\uc57d \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uc2e4\ud589 \uac80\uc99d\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud050\ub808\uc774\uc158, \uc815\ucc45 \uc778\uc2dd \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud569\uc131 \ubc0f \ucd5c\uc545\uc758 \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc6b0\uc120 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc218\uc815\ub41c \ud3c9\uac00 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uae30\uc874 \uac80\uc99d \uc2a4\uc704\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucd98 \ud604\uc2e4 \uc815\ub82c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \ud050\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u0430\u043a\u0442\ud55c 4B-\ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0\uc11c 69.2% \ucee4\ubc84\ub9ac\uc9c0 \ud569\uaca9\ub960\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc2a4\uc2b9 \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 5.3% \ub192\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70 \ud06c\uae30\uac00 \ud55c \ucc28\uc6d0 \ub354 \ud070 \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

Advances in large language models (LLMs) make natural language a practical interface for goal-directed tasks, yet most current web agents operate on low-level primitives such as clicks and keystrokes. These operations are brittle, inefficient, and difficult to verify. Complementing content-oriented efforts such as NLWeb's semantic layer for retrieval, we argue that the agentic web also requires a semantic layer for web actions. We propose \\textbf{Web Verbs}, a web-scale set of typed, semantically documented functions that expose site capabilities through a uniform interface, whether implemented through APIs or robust client-side workflows. These verbs serve as stable and composable units that agents can discover, select, and synthesize into concise programs. This abstraction unifies API-based and browser-based paradigms, enabling LLMs to synthesize reliable and auditable workflows with explicit control and data flow.

In clinical practice, the correct diagnosis can rarely be immediately inferred from the initial patient presentation alone. Rather, reaching a diagnosis often involves systematic history taking, during which clinicians reason over multiple potential conditions through iterative questioning to resolve uncertainty. This process requires considering differential diagnoses and actively excluding emergencies that demand immediate intervention. Yet, the ability of medical LLMs to generate informative follow-up questions and thus reason over differential diagnoses remains underexplored. Here, we introduce MedClarify, an AI agent for information-seeking that can generate follow-up questions for iterative reasoning to support diagnostic decision-making. Specifically, MedClarify computes a list of candidate diagnoses analogous to a differential diagnosis, and then proactively generates follow-up questions aimed at reducing diagnostic uncertainty. By selecting the question with the highest expected information gain, MedClarify enables targeted, uncertainty-aware reasoning to improve diagnostic performance. In our experiments, we first demonstrate the limitations of current LLMs in medical reasoning, which often yield multiple, similarly likely diagnoses, especially when patient cases are incomplete or relevant information for diagnosis is missing. We then show that our information-theoretic reasoning approach can generate effective follow-up questioning and thereby reduces diagnostic errors by ~27 percentage points (p.p.) compared to a standard single-shot LLM baseline. Altogether, MedClarify offers a path to improve medical LLMs through agentic information-seeking and to thus promote effective dialogues with medical LLMs that reflect the iterative and uncertain nature of real-world clinical reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "MedClarify\ub294 \uc9c4\ub2e8 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud6c4\uc18d \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c, \uc758\ub8cc LLM\uc758 \uc815\ubcf4 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uc9c4\ub2e8 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \uc904\uc774\ub294 \ub370 \uae30\uc5ec\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc758\ub8cc\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c4\ub2e8 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud65c\uc6a9\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\ub098, \ucd08\uae30 \ud658\uc790 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \uc62c\ubc14\ub978 \uc9c4\ub2e8\uc744 \uac70\uc758 \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\ub860\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub2e4.", "method": "MedClarify\ub294 \ucc28\ubcc4\uc801 \uc9c4\ub2e8\uacfc \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \ud6c4\ubcf4 \uc9c4\ub2e8 \ubaa9\ub85d\uc744 \uacc4\uc0b0\ud558\uace0, \uc9c4\ub2e8 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ub454 \ud6c4\uc18d \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud604\uc7ac LLM\uc758 \uc758\ub8cc \ucd94\ub860 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uace0, \uc815\ubcf4 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \uc811\uadfc\uc774 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ud6c4\uc18d \uc9c8\ubb38 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc9c4\ub2e8 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \uc57d 27% \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8 \uc904\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "MedClarify\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc815\ubcf4 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc758\ub8cc LLM\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0, \uc2e4\uc138\uacc4 \uc784\uc0c1 \ucd94\ub860\uc758 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud55c \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \ubc18\uc601\ud558\ub294 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ub300\ud654\ub97c \ucd09\uc9c4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uae38\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \uc758\ud559\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c4\ub2e8 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc774 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc784\uc0c1 \uc2e4\ubb34\uc5d0\uc11c \uc62c\ubc14\ub978 \uc9c4\ub2e8\uc740 \ucd08\uae30 \ud658\uc790 \uc81c\uc2dc\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \uac70\uc758 \uc989\uac01\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\ucd94\ub420 \uc218 \uc5c6\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc624\ud788\ub824 \uc9c4\ub2e8\uc5d0 \uc774\ub974\ub294 \uacfc\uc815\uc740 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \uc774\ub825 \uc870\uc0ac\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uba70, \uc774 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc784\uc0c1\uc758\ub294 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \ud574\uc18c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c8\ubb38\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uacfc\uc815\uc740 \ucc28\ubcc4\uc801 \uc9c4\ub2e8\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud558\uace0 \uc989\uac01\uc801\uc778 \uac1c\uc785\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc751\uae09 \uc0c1\ud669\uc744 \uc801\uadf9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubc30\uc81c\ud574\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc758\ub8cc LLM\uc774 \uc720\uc775\ud55c \ud6c4\uc18d \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \ucc28\ubcc4\uc801 \uc9c4\ub2e8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ucd94\ub860\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc740 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \ud0d0\uc0c9\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5ec\uae30\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc9c4\ub2e8 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud6c4\uc18d \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc815\ubcf4 \ud0d0\uc0c9 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc778 MedClarify\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c MedClarify\ub294 \ucc28\ubcc4\uc801 \uc9c4\ub2e8\uc5d0 \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \ud6c4\ubcf4 \uc9c4\ub2e8 \ubaa9\ub85d\uc744 \uacc4\uc0b0\ud558\uace0 \uc9c4\ub2e8 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \ud6c4\uc18d \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Current CoT evaluation narrowly focuses on target task accuracy. However, this metric fails to assess the quality or utility of the reasoning process itself. To address this limitation, we introduce two novel measures: reusability and verifiability. We decouple CoT generation from execution using a Thinker-Executor framework. Reusability measures how easily an Executor can reuse the Thinker's CoT. Verifiability measures how frequently an Executor can match the Thinker's answer using the CoT. We evaluated four Thinker models against a committee of ten Executor models across five benchmarks. Our results reveal that reusability and verifiability do not correlate with standard accuracy, exposing a blind spot in current accuracy-based leaderboards for reasoning capability. Surprisingly, we find that CoTs from specialized reasoning models are not consistently more reusable or verifiable than those from general-purpose LLMs like Llama and Gemma.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc815\ubcf4 \uac80\uc0c9 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uccb4\uc778 \uc624\ube0c \uc0dd\uac01\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc911\uac04 \ucd94\ub860 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ucc99\ub3c4\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uccb4\uc778 \uc624\ube0c \uc0dd\uac01 \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc5d0\ub9cc \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ucd94\ub860 \uacfc\uc815\uc758 \uc9c8\uc774\ub098 \uc720\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc0dd\uac01\uac00-\uc2e4\ud589\uc790 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uccb4\uc778 \uc624\ube0c \uc0dd\uac01 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc2e4\ud589\uacfc \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\uace0, \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9\uc131 \ubc0f \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uce21\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ucc99\ub3c4\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc0dd\uac01\uac00 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc5f4 \uac1c\uc758 \uc2e4\ud589\uc790 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc704\uc6d0\ud68c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9\uc131\uacfc \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \ud45c\uc900 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uacfc \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4\uac00 \uc5c6\uc74c\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ud2b9\ud654\ub41c \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uccb4\uc778 \uc624\ube0c \uc0dd\uac01\uc774 Llama\uc640 Gemma \uac19\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18 \ubaa9\uc801\uc758 LLM\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc774 \ub180\ub78d\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc815\ubcf4 \uac80\uc0c9 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uac80\uc0c9 \ubc0f \uc21c\uc704 \uc9c0\uc815\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc774 \uccb4\uc778 \uc624\ube0c \uc0dd\uac01(Cot) \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc911\uac04 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc11c\ub85c \uad50\ud658\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 Cot \ud3c9\uac00\ub294 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc5d0\ub9cc \uc881\uac8c \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc740 \ucd94\ub860 \uacfc\uc815 \uc790\uccb4\uc758 \uc9c8\uc774\ub098 \uc720\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9\uc131\uacfc \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ucc99\ub3c4\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc0dd\uac01\uac00-\uc2e4\ud589\uc790 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec Cot \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc2e4\ud589\uacfc \ubd84\ub9ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9\uc131\uc740 \uc2e4\ud589\uc790\uac00 \uc0dd\uac01\uac00\uc758 Cot\ub97c \uc5bc\ub9c8\ub098 \uc27d\uac8c \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uce21\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc740 \uc2e4\ud589\uc790\uac00 Cot\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc0dd\uac01\uac00\uc758 \ub2f5\ubcc0\uacfc \uc5bc\ub9c8\ub098 \uc790\uc8fc \uc77c\uce58\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uce21\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc0dd\uac01\uac00 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ub2e4\uc12f \uac00\uc9c0 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc5f4 \uac1c\uc758 \uc2e4\ud589\uc790 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc704\uc6d0\ud68c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud3c9\uac00\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9\uc131\uacfc \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \ud45c\uc900 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uacfc \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4\uac00 \uc5c6\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131 \uae30\ubc18 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uce21\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ub9ac\ub354\ubcf4\ub4dc\uc5d0\uc11c \ub9f9\uc810\uc744 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub180\ub78d\uac8c\ub3c4 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud2b9\ud654\ub41c \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 Cot\uac00 Llama \ubc0f Gemma\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18 \ubaa9\uc801\uc758 LLM\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ub354 \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Conventional AI benchmarks typically assess only narrow capabilities in a limited range of human activity. Most are also static, quickly saturating as developers explicitly or implicitly optimize for them. We propose that a more promising way to evaluate human-like general intelligence in AI systems is through a particularly strong form of general game playing: studying how and how well they play and learn to play \\textbf{all conceivable human games}, in comparison to human players with the same level of experience, time, or other resources. We define a \"human game\" to be a game designed by humans for humans, and argue for the evaluative suitability of this space of all such games people can imagine and enjoy -- the \"Multiverse of Human Games\". Taking a first step towards this vision, we introduce the AI GameStore, a scalable and open-ended platform that uses LLMs with humans-in-the-loop to synthesize new representative human games, by automatically sourcing and adapting standardized and containerized variants of game environments from popular human digital gaming platforms. As a proof of concept, we generated 100 such games based on the top charts of Apple App Store and Steam, and evaluated seven frontier vision-language models (VLMs) on short episodes of play. The best models achieved less than 10\\% of the human average score on the majority of the games, and especially struggled with games that challenge world-model learning, memory and planning. We conclude with a set of next steps for building out the AI GameStore as a practical way to measure and drive progress toward human-like general intelligence in machines.", "AI": {"tldr":

While deep reinforcement learning (DRL) combined with domain randomization has shown promise in mitigating the sim-to-real gap, simultaneously handling all sources of uncertainty often leads to sub-optimal policies and poor learning efficiency. This study formulates a new curriculum-based continual learning framework for robust control problems involving nonlinear dynamical systems in which multiple sources of uncertainty are simultaneously superimposed. The key idea is to decompose a complex control problem with multiple uncertainties into a sequence of continual learning tasks, in which strategies for handling each uncertainty are acquired sequentially. The original system is extended into a finite set of plants whose dynamic uncertainties are gradually expanded and diversified as learning progresses. The policy is stably updated across the entire plant sets associated with tasks defined by different uncertainty configurations without catastrophic forgetting. To ensure learning efficiency, we jointly incorporate a model-based controller (MBC), which guarantees a shared baseline performance across the plant sets, into the learning process to accelerate the convergence. This residual learning scheme facilitates task-specific optimization of the DRL agent for each uncertainty, thereby enhancing sample efficiency. As a practical industrial application, this study applies the proposed method to designing an active vibration controller for automotive powertrains. We verified that the resulting controller is robust against structural nonlinearities and dynamic variations, realizing successful sim-to-real transfer.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ube44\uc120\ud615

To address this challenge, we introduce FAMOSE (Feature AugMentation and Optimal Selection agEnt), a novel framework that leverages the ReAct paradigm to autonomously explore, generate, and refine features while integrating feature selection and evaluation tools within an agent architecture. To our knowledge, FAMOSE represents the first application of an agentic ReAct framework to automated feature engineering, especially for both regression and classification tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FAMOSE is at or near the state-of-the-art on classification tasks (especially tasks with more than 10K instances, where ROC-AUC increases 0.23% on average), and achieves the state-of-the-art for regression tasks by reducing RMSE by 2.0% on average, while remaining more robust to errors than other algorithms. We hypothesize that FAMOSE's strong performance is because ReAct allows the LLM context window to record (via iterative feature discovery and evaluation steps) what features did or did not work. This is similar to a few-shot prompt and guides the LLM to invent better, more innovative features. Our work offers evidence that AI agents are remarkably effective in solving problems that require highly inventive solutions, such as feature engineering.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 FAMOSE\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9 \uae30\ub2a5 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ubc0f \uc120\ud0dd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uae30\ub2a5 \uacf5\ud559 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc744 \uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uae30\ub2a5 \uacf5\ud559\uc740 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc804\ubb38 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "FAMOSE\ub294 ReAct \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud0d0\uc0c9, \uc0dd\uc131 \ubc0f \ub2e4\ub4ec\uc73c\uba70, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\ub2a5 \uc120\ud0dd \ubc0f \ud3c9\uac00 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "FAMOSE\ub294 \ubd84\ub958 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud558\uace0, \ud68c\uadc0 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 RMSE\ub97c \ud3c9\uade0 2.0% \uc904\uc774\uba70, \uc624\ub958\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "FAMOSE\ub294 \ud2b9\uc131 \uacf5\ud559 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\uc5b4 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \ubc1c\ud718\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud2b9\uc9d5 \uacf5\ud559\uc740 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5, \ud2b9\ud788 \ud45c \ud615\uc2dd \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uae09\uc99d\ud558\ub294 \ud2b9\uc131 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc804\ubb38 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 FAMOSE(Feature AugMentation and Optimal Selection agEnt)\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.
