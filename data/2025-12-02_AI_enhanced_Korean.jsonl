Existing defenses either depend on single trusted auditors, creating single points of failure, or sacrifice efficiency for robustness. To resolve this tension, we propose \\textbf{AgentShield}, a distributed framework for efficient, decentralized auditing. AgentShield introduces a novel three-layer defense: \\textbf{(i) Critical Node Auditing} prioritizes high-influence agents via topological analysis; \\textbf{(ii) Light Token Auditing} implements a cascade protocol using lightweight sentry models for rapid discriminative verification; and \\textbf{(iii) Two-Round Consensus Auditing} triggers heavyweight arbiters only upon uncertainty to ensure global agreement. This principled design optimizes the robustness-efficiency trade-off. Experiments demonstrate that AgentShield achieves a 92.5\\% recovery rate and reduces auditing overhead by over 70\\% compared to existing methods, maintaining high collaborative accuracy across diverse MAS topologies and adversarial scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "AgentShield\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ubd84\uc0b0\ub41c \uac10\uc0ac \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc138 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc758 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uccb4\uacc4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc800\ud56d\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ud611\ub825\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc758 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\uc5ec \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc804\uccb4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc800\ud558\ub418\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "AgentShield\ub294 \ubd84\uc0b0 \uac10\uc0ac \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, (i) \uc8fc\uc694 \ub178\ub4dc \uac10\uc0ac\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc6b0\uc120\uc2dc\ud558\uace0, (ii) \uacbd\ub7c9 \ud1a0\ud070 \uac10\uc0ac\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ube60\ub978 \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uacc4\ub2e8\uc2dd \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \uc2e4\ud589\ud558\uba70, (iii) \ub450 \ub2e8\uacc4 \ud569\uc758 \uac10\uc0ac\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud560 \ub54c\ub9cc \ubb34\uac70\uc6b4 \uc911\uc7ac\uc790\ub97c \ud638\ucd9c\ud558\uc5ec \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ud569\uc758\ub97c \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "AgentShield\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 92.5%\uc758 \ubcf5\uad6c\uc728\uacfc 70% \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uac10\uc0ac \ubd80\ub2f4 \uac10\uc18c\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c MAS \ud1a0\ud3f4\ub85c\uc9c0\uc640 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \ub192\uc740 \ud611\ub825 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc6d0\uce59\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uc124\uacc4\ub294 \uac15\ub825\uc131\uacfc \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \uc808\ucda9\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(MAS)\uc740 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud611\ub825\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc190\uc0c1\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc804\uccb4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc800\ud558\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubc29\uc5b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc2e0\ub8b0 \uac10\uc0ac\uc790\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e8\uc77c \uc2e4\ud328 \uc9c0\uc810\uc744 \ub9cc\ub4e4\uac70\ub098 \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud76c\uc0dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uae34\uc7a5\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ubd84\uc0b0\ub41c \uac10\uc0ac \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 AgentShield\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

The final published version of record appears in Superintelligence - Robotics - Safety and Alignment, 2(5), 2025, and is available at https://doi.org/10.70777/si.v2i5.15579", "summary": "We propose a novel protocol for aligning artificial superintelligence (ASI) based on mutual verification among multiple isolated systems that self-modify to achieve alignment. The protocol operates by containing multiple diverse artificial superintelligences in strict isolation (\"boxes\"), with humans remaining entirely outside the system. Each superintelligence has no ability to communicate with humans and cannot communicate directly with other superintelligences. The only interaction possible is through an auditable submission interface accessible exclusively to the superintelligences themselves, through which they can: (1) submit alignment proofs with attested state snapshots, (2) validate or disprove other superintelligences' proofs, (3) request self-modifications, (4) approve or disapprove modification requests from others, (5) report hidden messages in submissions, and (6) confirm or refute hidden message reports. A reputation system incentivizes honest behavior, with reputation gained through correct evaluations and lost through incorrect ones. The key insight is that without direct communication channels, diverse superintelligences can only achieve consistent agreement by converging on objective truth rather than coordinating on deception. This naturally leads to what we call a \"consistent group\", essentially a truth-telling coalition that emerges because isolated systems cannot coordinate on lies but can independently recognize valid claims. Release from containment requires both high reputation and verification by multiple high-reputation superintelligences. While our approach requires substantial computational resources and does not address the creation of diverse artificial superintelligences, it provides a framework for leveraging peer verification among superintelligent systems to solve the alignment problem.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc0c1\ud638 \uac80\uc99d \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5

A preliminary version has been accepted by the AAAI 2026 Theory of Mind for AI (ToM4AI) Workshop", "summary": "Originating in psychology, $\\textit{Theory of Mind}$ (ToM) has attracted significant attention across multiple research communities, especially logic, economics, and robotics. Most psychological work does not aim at formalizing those central concepts, namely $\\textit{goals}$, $\\textit{intentions}$, and $\\textit{beliefs}$, to automate a ToM-based computational process, which, by contrast, has been extensively studied by logicians. In this paper, we offer a different perspective by proposing a computational framework viewed through the lens of game theory. On the one hand, the framework prescribes how to make boudedly rational decisions while maintaining a theory of mind about others (and recursively, each of the others holding a theory of mind about the rest); on the other hand, it employs statistical techniques and approximate solutions to retain computability of the inherent computational problem.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uac8c\uc784 \uc774\ub860\uc758 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc0ac\uace0(Theory of Mind)\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uacc4\uc0b0 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc0ac\uace0\ub294 \uc2ec\ub9ac\ud559\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\uc791\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc5f0\uad6c \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uad00\uc2ec\uc744 \ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uac8c\uc784 \uc774\ub860\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc0ac\uace0\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ud569\ub9ac\uc801 \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ub0b4\ub9ac\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uace0, \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \uae30\ubc95\uacfc \uadfc\uc0ac \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uacc4\uc0b0 \ubb38\uc81c\uc758 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ud569\ub9ac\uc131\uc758 \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ub0b4\ub9ac\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud558\uace0 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc0ac\uace0\ub97c \uc218\ud559\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc811\uadfc\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc2ec\ub9ac\ud559\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\ub798\ud55c $\textit{\uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc0ac\uace0(Theory of Mind)}$\ub294 \ub17c\ub9ac\ud559, \uacbd\uc81c\ud559 \ubc0f \ub85c\ubd07 \uacf5\ud559\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc5f0\uad6c \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ud2f0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uad00\uc2ec\uc744 \ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \uc2ec\ub9ac\ud559\uc801 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 $\textit{\ubaa9\ud45c}$, $\textit{\uc758\ub3c4}$ \ubc0f $\textit{\ubbff\uc74c}$\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc911\uc2ec \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \ud615\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uc5ec ToM \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacfc\uc815\uc740 \ub17c\ub9ac\ud559\uc790\ub4e4\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud558\uac8c \uc5f0\uad6c\ub418\uc5b4 \uc654\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uac8c\uc784 \uc774\ub860\uc758 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf8 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\ub978 \uc0ac\ub78c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc0ac\uace0\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ud569\ub9ac\uc801 \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ub0b4\ub9ac\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ucc98\ubc29\ud558\uace0, \ubcf8\ub798\uc758 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ubb38\uc81c\uc758 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \uae30\ubc95\uacfc \uadfc\uc0ac \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\ub978 \uc2dc\uac01\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative by dynamically interpreting design spaces and leveraging encoded domain knowledge. To this end, we introduce AUTO, an LLM agent framework that treats design optimization as a gradient-free search problem guided by strategic LLM reasoning. The framework employs two collaborative agents: a Strategist that selects between exploration and exploitation strategies, and an Implementor that executes detailed designs. Applied to GPU code optimization -- a domain critical to fields from machine learning to scientific computing -- AUTO generates solutions competitive with expert implementations for chemical kinetics integration and dense matrix multiplication. The framework achieves 50-70% search efficiency relative to Bayesian optimization methodologies. It completes optimizations in approximately 8 hours at an estimated cost of up to \\$159 per run, compared to an estimated cost of up to \\$480 with median-wage software developers.

We show that this multiplicity reshapes key aspects of trustworthiness. At the individual-model level, sparse interpretable models tend to preserve privacy but are fragile to adversarial attacks. In contrast, the diversity within a large Rashomon set enables reactive robustness: even when an attack breaks one model, others often remain accurate. Rashomon sets are also stable under small distribution shifts. However, this same diversity increases information leakage, as disclosing more near-optimal models provides an attacker with progressively richer views of the training data. Through theoretical analysis and empirical studies of sparse decision trees and linear models, we characterize this robustness-privacy trade-off and highlight the dual role of Rashomon sets as both a resource and a risk for trustworthy ML.", "AI": {"tldr": "ML \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc740 \ub2e8\uc77c \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc544\ub2cc \uc5ec\ub7ec \uac1c\uc758 \uadfc\uc0ac \ucd5c\uc801 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \uce21\uba74\uc774 \uc7ac\ud615\uc131\ub41c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 ML \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uc774 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ub41c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub2e4\uc218\uc758 \uadfc\uc0ac \ucd5c\uc801 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc0dd\uc131\ub418\ub294 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud76c\uc18c \uacb0\uc815 \ud2b8\ub9ac\uc640 \uc120\ud615 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ubd84\uc11d\uacfc \uc2e4\uc99d \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uc774 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubc18\uc751\uc801 \uacac\uace0\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub098, \uc815\ubcf4 \uc720\ucd9c\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Rashomon \uc138\ud2b8\ub294 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 ML\uc758 \uc790\uc6d0\uacfc \uc704\ud5d8 \ubaa8\ub450\ub85c\uc11c\uc758 \uc774\uc911 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud604\uc2e4 \uc138\uacc4\uc758 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5(ML) \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc740 \ub2e8\uc77c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub4dc\ubb3c\uba70, \ub300\uc2e0 \ub9ce\uc740 \uadfc\uc0ac \ucd5c\uc801 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ub77c\uc1fc\ubaac \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub2e4\uc218\uc131\uc774 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \uce21\uba74\uc744 \uc7ac\ud615\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \uac1c\ubcc4 \ubaa8\ub378 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc5d0\uc11c \ud76c\uc18c \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\ub2e4. \ubc18\ub300\ub85c, \ud070 \ub77c\uc1fc\ubaac \uc9d1\ud569 \ub0b4\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uc740 \ubc18\uc751\uc801 \uacac\uace0\uc131\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4: \ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uacf5\uaca9\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ub9dd\uac00\uc838\ub3c4 \ub2e4\ub978 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub77c\uc1fc\ubaac \uc9d1\ud569\uc740 \uc791\uc740 \ubd84\ud3ec \uc774\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uc740 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc720\ucd9c\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4. \ub354 \ub9ce\uc740 \uadfc\uc0ac \ucd5c\uc801 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uacf5\uac1c\ud560\uc218\ub85d \uacf5\uaca9\uc790\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \uc2dc\uac01\uc744 \uc5bb\uac8c \ub41c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud76c\uc18c \uacb0\uc815 \ud2b8\ub9ac\uc640 \uc120\ud615 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ubd84\uc11d\uacfc \uc2e4\uc99d \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacac\uace0\uc131\uacfc \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \uac04\uc758 \ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ub4dc\uc624\ud504\ub97c \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc9d3\uace0, \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 ML\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc790\uc6d0 \ubc0f \uc704\ud5d8\uc73c\ub85c\uc11c\uc758 \ub77c\uc1fc\ubaac \uc138\ud2b8\uc758 \uc774\uc911 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

They are nourished by collecting rich streams of data, raising privacy concerns around excessive collection of sensitive personal information. Privacy policies are the fundamental mechanism for informing users about data practices in modern information privacy paradigm. Although traditional web and mobile policies are well studied, the privacy policies of LLM providers, their LLM-specific content, and their evolution over time remain largely underexplored. In this paper, we present the first longitudinal empirical study of privacy policies for mainstream LLM providers worldwide. We curate a chronological dataset of 74 historical privacy policies and 115 supplemental privacy documents from 11 LLM providers across 5 countries up to August 2025, and extract over 3,000 sentence-level edits between consecutive policy versions. We compare LLM privacy policies to those of other software formats, propose a taxonomy tailored to LLM privacy policies, annotate policy edits and align them with a timeline of key LLM ecosystem events. Results show they are substantially longer, demand college-level reading ability, and remain highly vague. Our taxonomy analysis reveals patterns in how providers disclose LLM-specific practices and highlights regional disparities in coverage. Policy edits are concentrated in first-party data collection and international/specific-audience sections, and that product releases and regulatory actions are the primary drivers, shedding light on the status quo and the evolution of LLM privacy policies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc758 \uac1c\uc778\uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638

However, large tool outputs can overflow the LLMs' context window, preventing task completion. Existing solutions such as truncation or summarization fail to preserve complete outputs, making them unsuitable for workflows requiring the full data. This work introduces a method that enables LLMs to process and utilize tool responses of arbitrary length without loss of information. By shifting the model's interaction from raw data to memory pointers, the method preserves tool functionality, allows seamless integration into agentic workflows, and reduces token usage and execution time. The proposed method is validated on a real-world Materials Science application that cannot be executed with conventional workflows, and its effectiveness is demonstrated via a comparative analysis where both methods succeed. In this experiment, the proposed approach consumed approximately seven times fewer tokens than the traditional workflow.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc190\uc2e4 \uc5c6\uc774 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uace0 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud654\ud559 \ubc0f \uc7ac\ub8cc \uacfc\ud559\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc9d1\uc57d\uc801 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc678\ubd80 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc640 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131.", "method": "\ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uc6d0\uc2dc \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ud3ec\uc778\ud130\ub85c \uc804\ud658\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\ubcf4 \uc190\uc2e4 \uc5c6\uc774 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uae30\uc874 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc57d 7\ubc30 \uc801\uc740 \ud1a0\ud070\uc744 \uc18c\ubaa8\ud558\uba70, \uc2e4\uc81c \uc7ac\ub8cc \uacfc\ud559 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uac80\uc99d.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uba85\ud655\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc720\uc2e4 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc6d0\ud65c\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5 \ud1b5\ud569 \ubc0f \uc2e4\ud589 \uc2dc\uac04 \ub2e8\ucd95\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \uc678\ubd80 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc640 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ubc94\uc704\ub97c \ucd08\uc6d4\ud55c \uc804\ubb38 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc5d0 \uc811\uadfc\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ud654\ud559 \ubc0f \uc7ac\ub8cc \uacfc\ud559\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc5ed\ub3d9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc9d1\uc57d\uc801\uc778 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub3c4\uad6c \ucd9c\ub825\uc740 LLM\uc758 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ucc3d\uc744 \ub118\uce60 \uc218 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc644\ub8cc\ub97c \ubc29\ud574\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc778 \uc798\ub77c\ub0b4\uae30\ub098 \uc694\uc57d\uc740 \uc644\uc804\ud55c \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc874\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud574 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\uc5d0\ub294 \uc801\ud569\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 LLM\uc774 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc190\uc2e4 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc784\uc758 \uae38\uc774\uc758 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uace0 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uc6d0\uc2dc \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ud3ec\uc778\ud130\ub85c \uc804\ud658\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc758 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc874\ud558\uace0, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc2dd \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\uc5d0 \ub9e4\ub044\ub7fd\uac8c \ud1b5\ud569\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ud1a0\ud070 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub7c9\uacfc \uc2e4\ud589 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \uc904\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uae30\uc874 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub85c\ub294 \uc2e4\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc7ac\ub8cc \uacfc\ud559 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0\uc11c \uac80\uc99d\ub418\uc5c8\uace0, \ub450 \ubc29\ubc95 \ubaa8\ub450 \uc131\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \ube44\uad50 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud6a8\uacfc\uac00 \uc785\uc99d\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc57d 7\ubc30 \uc801\uc740 \ud1a0\ud070\uc744 \uc18c\ube44\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

In this paper, we present a rigorous analysis of the impact of backdoor data on the learning process, with a particular focus on the distinct behaviors between the target class and other clean classes. Leveraging the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle connected with clustering of internal representation, We find that backdoor attacks create unique mutual information (MI) signatures, which evolve across training phases and differ based on the attack mechanism. Our analysis uncovers a surprising trade-off: visually conspicuous attacks like BadNets can achieve high stealthiness from an information-theoretic perspective, integrating more seamlessly into the model than many visually imperceptible attacks. Building on these insights, we propose a novel, dynamics-based stealthiness metric that quantifies an attack's integration at the model level. We validate our findings and the proposed metric across multiple datasets and diverse attack types, offering a new dimension for understanding and evaluating backdoor threats.

This study introduces a reproducible framework for analysing eight polymorphic behaviours-junk code insertion, control-flow obfuscation, packing, data encoding, domain generation, randomized beacon timing, protocol mimicry, and format/header tweaks-and evaluates their detectability across three layers: commercial AVs, custom rule-based detectors (YARA/Sigma), and endpoint detection and response (EDR) telemetry. Eleven inert polymorphic variants were generated per behaviour using controlled mutation engines and executed in isolated environments. Detection performance was assessed by detection rate (DR), false positive rate (FPR), and combined coverage. AVs achieved an average DR of 34%, YARA/Sigma 74% and EDR 76%; integrated detection reached ~92% with an FPR of 3.5%. Iterative YARA tuning showed a trade-off between detection and FPR, while behaviour-specific trends revealed static polymorphisms were best caught by custom rules, dynamic by EDR, and network-level by Sigma-like analysis. These results affirm that hybrid detection pipelines combining static, dynamic, and network-layer analytics offer resilient defence against polymorphic malware and form a baseline for future adaptive detection research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc9c4\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ud3f4\ub9ac\ubaa8\ud53d \uc545\uc131\ucf54\ub4dc\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc7ac\ud604 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uace0, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud3f4\ub9ac\ubaa8\ud53d \uc545\uc131\ucf54\ub4dc\ub294 \uc11c\uba85 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\uc5b4\ub97c \ud53c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ubcc0\uacbd\ud558\uc5ec \uc0c1\uc5c5\uc6a9 \uc548\ud2f0\ubc14\uc774\ub7ec\uc2a4\uc640 \uae30\uc5c5 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ub3c4\uc804\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "8\uac00\uc9c0 \ud3f4\ub9ac\ubaa8\ud53d \ud589\ub3d9(\uc815\ud06c \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0bd\uc785, \uc81c\uc5b4 \ud750\ub984 \ub09c\ub3c5\ud654, \ud328\ud0b9, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc778\ucf54\ub529, \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc0dd\uc131, \ub79c\ub364 \ube44\ucf58 \ud0c0\uc774\ubc0d, \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c \ubaa8\ubc29, \ud3ec\ub9f7/\ud5e4\ub354 \uc870\uc815)\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uace0, \uc0c1\uc5c5\uc6a9 AV, \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc815\uc758 \uaddc\uce59 \uae30\ubc18 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uae30(YARA/Sigma), \uc5d4\ub4dc\ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ubc0f \ub300\uc751(EDR) \ud154\ub808\uba54\ud2b8\ub9ac\uc758 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uce35\uc5d0\uc11c \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "AV\uc758 \ud3c9\uade0 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uc728(DR)\uc740 34%, YARA/Sigma\ub294 74%, EDR\uc740 76%\uc5d0 \ub2ec\ud588\uace0, \ud1b5\ud569 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub294 \uc57d 92%\uc5d0 \ub3c4\ub2ec\ud558\uba70, \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \uae0d\uc815\ub960(FPR)\uc740 3.5%\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc815\uc801, \ub3d9\uc801, \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ub808\uc774\uc5b4 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc774 \ud3f4\ub9ac\ubaa8\ud53d \uc545\uc131\ucf54\ub4dc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ubc29\uc5b4\ucc45\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0 \ud5a5\ud6c4 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \ud615\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud3f4\ub9ac\ubaa8\ud53d \uc545\uc131\ucf54\ub4dc\ub294 \uc11c\uba85 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\uc5b4\ub97c \ud53c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ubcc0\uacbd\ud558\uc5ec \uc0c1\uc5c5\uc6a9 \uc548\ud2f0\ubc14\uc774\ub7ec\uc2a4(AV)\uc640 \uae30\uc5c5 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ub3c4\uc804\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc815\ud06c \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0bd\uc785, \uc81c\uc5b4 \ud750\ub984 \ub09c\ub3c5\ud654, \ud328\ud0b9, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc778\ucf54\ub529, \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc0dd\uc131, \ub79c\ub364 \ube44\ucf58 \ud0c0\uc774\ubc0d, \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c \ubaa8\ubc29, \ud3ec\ub9f7/\ud5e4\ub354 \uc870\uc815\uc758 8\uac00\uc9c0 \ud3f4\ub9ac\ubaa8\ud53d \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc7ac\ud604 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uace0, \uc0c1\uc5c5\uc6a9 AV, \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc815\uc758 \uaddc\uce59 \uae30\ubc18 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uae30(YARA/Sigma), \uc5d4\ub4dc\ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ubc0f \ub300\uc751(EDR) \ud154\ub808\uba54\ud2b8\ub9ac\uc758 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uce35\uc5d0\uc11c \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4. \uac01 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 11\uac1c\uc758 \ube44\ud65c\uc131 \ud3f4\ub9ac\ubaa8\ud53d \ubcc0\ud615\uc774 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub41c \ubcc0\uc774 \uc5d4\uc9c4\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc0dd\uc131\ub418\uc5c8\uace0, \uace0\ub9bd\ub41c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\ud589\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc131\ub2a5\uc740 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uc728(DR), \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \uae0d\uc815\ub960(FPR), \uacb0\ud569\ub41c \ucee4\ubc84\ub9ac\uc9c0\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.

The paper outlines an agentic artificial intelligence system to study atmospheric water-cycle intelligence, which combines sensing, forecasting, downscaling, hydrological modeling and coordinated response into a single, interconnected, priceless, closed-loop system. The framework uses autonomous but cooperative agents that reason, sense, and act throughout the entire event lifecycle, and use the intelligence of weather prediction to become real-time decision intelligence. Comparison of multi-year radar, satellite, and ground-based evaluation of the northern part of Pakistan demonstrates that the multi-agent configuration enhances forecast reliability, critical success index and warning lead time compared to the baseline models. Population reach was maximised, and errors during evacuation were minimised through communication and routing agents, and adaptive recalibration and transparent auditability were provided by the embedded layer of learning. Collectively, this leads to the conclusion that collaborative AI agents are capable of transforming atmospheric data streams into practicable foresight and provide a platform of scalable adaptive and learning-based climate resilience.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc608\uce21 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud55c\uacc4\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \uadf9\ub2e8\uc801 \uc9e7\uc740 \uae30\uac04 \uac15\uc6b0 \uc0ac\uac74\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc608\uce21 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uadf9\ub2e8\uc801 \uc9e7\uc740 \uae30\uac04\uc758 \uac15\uc6b0 \uc0ac\uac74\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc608\uce21\uacfc \ub300\uc751\uc774 \ubcc4\uac1c\uc758 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub85c \ucc98\ub9ac\ub418\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubd84\uc704\uae30 \uc218\uc790\uc6d0 \uc21c\ud658 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uac10\uc9c0, \uc608\uce21, \ub2e4\uc6b4\uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1, \uc218\ubb38 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \ubc0f \uc870\uc815\ub41c \ubc18\uc751\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud30c\ud0a4\uc2a4\ud0c4 \ubd81\ubd80\uc758 \ub2e4\ub144\uac04 \ub808\uc774\ub2e4, \uc704\uc131 \ubc0f \uc9c0\uc0c1 \uae30\ubc18 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uba40\ud2f0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uad6c\uc131 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \uae30\ubcf8 \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc608\uce21 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131, \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc131\uacf5 \uc9c0\uc218 \ubc0f \uacbd\uace0 \ub9ac\ub4dc \ud0c0\uc784\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b4\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ud611\uc5c5 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ub300\uae30 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9bc\uc744 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uc608\uce21\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uae30\ud6c4 \ubcf5\uc6d0\ub825 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc608\uce21\uacfc \ub300\uc751\uc774 \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub85c \uac04\uc8fc\ub418\ub294 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc608\uce21 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uadf9\ub2e8\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc9e7\uc740 \uae30\uac04\uc758 \uac15\uc6b0 \uc0ac\uac74\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub2e4\ub8e8\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uac10\uc9c0, \uc608\uce21, \ub2e4\uc6b4\uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1, \uc218\ubb38 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \ubc0f \uc870\uc815\ub41c \ubc18\uc751\uc744 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5f0\uacb0\ub41c \ud3d0\uc1c4 \ub8e8\ud504 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc73c\ub85c \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \ub300\uae30 \uc218\uc790\uc6d0 \uc21c\ud658 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uac1c\ub7b5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc124\uba85\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc804\uccb4 \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8 \uc218\uba85 \uc8fc\uae30 \ub3d9\uc548 \ucd94\ub860\ud558\uace0 \uac10\uc9c0\ud558\uba70 \ud589\ub3d9\ud558\ub294 \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc \ud611\ub825\uc801\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uace0, \uae30\uc0c1 \uc608\uce21\uc758 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc73c\ub85c \ubc1c\uc804\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4. \ud30c\ud0a4\uc2a4\ud0c4 \ubd81\ubd80\uc758 \ub2e4\ub144\uac04 \ub808\uc774\ub2e4, \uc704\uc131 \ubc0f \uc9c0\uc0c1 \uae30\ubc18 \ud3c9\uac00 \ube44\uad50\ub294 \uba40\ud2f0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uad6c\uc131 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \uae30\ubcf8 \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc608\uce21 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131, \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc131\uacf5 \uc9c0\uc218 \ubc0f \uacbd\uace0 \ub9ac\ub4dc \ud0c0\uc784\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b4\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \uc778\uad6c \ub3c4\ub2ec \ubc94\uc704\uac00 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ub418\uc5c8\uace0, \ub300\ud53c \uc911 \uc624\ub958\uac00 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ub0b4\uc7a5 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc7ac\ubcf4\uc815 \ubc0f \ud22c\uba85\ud55c \uac10\uc0ac \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \uc81c\uacf5\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc810\uc5d0\uc11c, \ud611\uc5c5 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ub300\uae30 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9bc\uc744 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uc608\uce21\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uae30\ud6c4 \ubcf5\uc6d0\ub825 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

Powered by Large Language and Vision-Language Models, IoA enables the development of interactive, rational agents capable of complex cooperation, moving far beyond traditional isolated models. IoA involves physical entities, i.e., Wireless Agents (WAs) with limited onboard resources, which need to offload their compute-intensive agentic AI services to nearby servers. Such servers can be Mobile Agents (MAs), e.g., vehicle agents, or Fixed Agents (FAs), e.g., end-side units agents. Given their fixed geographical locations and stable connectivity, FAs can serve as reliable communication gateways and task aggregation points. This stability allows them to effectively coordinate with and offload to an Aerial Agent (AA) tier, which has an advantage not affordable for highly mobile MAs with dynamic connectivity limitations. As such, we propose a two-tier optimization approach. The first tier employs a multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game. In the game, MAs and FAs act as the leaders who set resource prices. WAs are the followers to determine task offloading ratios. However, when FAs become overloaded, they can further offload tasks to available aerial resources. Therefore, the second tier introduces a Double Dutch Auction model where overloaded FAs act as the buyers to request resources, and AAs serve as the sellers for resource provision. We then develop a diffusion-based Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm to solve the model.

Despite the advancements in deep learning, feature transformation remains essential for structured data, where deep models often struggle to capture complex feature interactions. Prior literature on automated feature transformation has achieved success but often relies on heuristics or exhaustive searches, leading to inefficient and time-consuming processes. Recent works employ reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance traditional approaches through a more effective trial-and-error way. However, two limitations remain: 1) Dynamic feature expansion during the transformation process, which causes instability and increases the learning complexity for RL agents; 2) Insufficient cooperation and communication between agents, which results in suboptimal feature crossing operations and degraded model performance. To address them, we propose a novel heterogeneous multi-agent RL framework to enable cooperative and scalable feature transformation. The framework comprises three heterogeneous agents, grouped into two types, each designed to select essential features and operations for feature crossing. To enhance communication among these agents, we implement a shared critic mechanism that facilitates information exchange during feature transformation. To handle the dynamically expanding feature space, we tailor multi-head attention-based feature agents to select suitable features for feature crossing.

This approach offers enhanced protection against adversarial AI threats. We demonstrate its efficacy through a concrete ESP32-based implementation, validating a crypto-agile transition with quantifiable performance and security improvements, underpinned by categorical proofs for AI security.

Forkert"], "title": "CRAwDAD: Causal Reasoning Augmentation with Dual-Agent Debate", "comment": "12 pages, 8 figures. Code available at https://github.com/finnvamosi/CRAwDAD", "summary": "When people reason about cause and effect, they often consider many competing \"what if\" scenarios before deciding which explanation fits best. Analogously, advanced language models capable of causal inference can consider multiple interventions and counterfactuals to judge the validity of causal claims. Crucially, this type of reasoning is less like a single calculation and more like an internal dialogue between alternative hypotheses. In this paper, we make this dialogue explicit through a dual-agent debate framework where one model provides a structured causal inference, and the other critically examines this reasoning for logical flaws. When disagreements arise, agents attempt to persuade each other, challenging each other's logic and revising their conclusions until they converge on a mutually agreed answer. To take advantage of this deliberative process, we specifically use reasoning language models, whose strengths in both causal inference and adversarial debate remain under-explored relative to standard large language models. We evaluate our approach on the CLadder dataset, a benchmark linking natural language questions to formally defined causal graphs across all three rungs of Pearl's ladder of causation. With Qwen3 and DeepSeek-R1 as debater agents, we demonstrate that multi-agent debate improves DeepSeek-R1's overall accuracy in causal inference from 78.03% to 87.45%, with the counterfactual category specifically improving from 67.94% to 80.04% accuracy. Similarly, Qwen3's overall accuracy improves from 84.16% to 89.41%, and counterfactual questions from 71.53% to 80.35%, showing that strong models can still benefit greatly from debate with weaker agents. Our results highlight the potential of reasoning models as building blocks for multi-agent systems in causal inference, and demonstrate the importance of diverse perspectives in causal problem-solving.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc778\uacfc \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc774\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud1a0\ub860 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uac00\uc124 \uac04\uc758 \ub0b4\uc801 \ub300\ud654\ub97c \uba85\ud655\ud788 \ud558\uc5ec, \uc9c4\uc220\uc758 \ud0c0\ub2f9\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc778\uacfc \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uc774\ud574\ud560 \ub54c \uc0ac\ub78c\ub4e4\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c '\uac00\uc815' \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub97c \uace0\ub824\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc778\uacfc \uc8fc\uc7a5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud0c0\ub2f9\uc131\uc744 \ud310\ub2e8\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc774 \ub41c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud1a0\ub860 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc778\uacfc \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0, \ub2e4\ub978 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801 \uacb0\ud568\uc744 \ube44\ud310\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\ud1a0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b CLadder\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c, DeepSeek-R1\uc758 \uc778\uacfc \ucd94\ub860 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uac00 78.03%\uc5d0\uc11c 87.45%\ub85c \uac1c\uc120\ub418\uc5c8\uace0, \ubc18\uc0ac\uc2e4\uc801 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub294 67.94%\uc5d0\uc11c 80.04%\ub85c \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.

This leads to theoretical challenges in the multi-agent setting where the non-stationarity induced by the learning of other agents demands prospective learning based on prediction models. To accurately model other agents, an agent must account for the fact that those other agents are, in turn, forming beliefs about it to predict its future behavior, motivating agents to model themselves as part of the environment. Here, building upon foundational work on universal artificial intelligence (AIXI), we introduce a mathematical framework for prospective learning and embedded agency centered on self-prediction, where Bayesian RL agents predict both future perceptual inputs and their own actions, and must therefore resolve epistemic uncertainty about themselves as part of the universe they inhabit. We show that in multi-agent settings, self-prediction enables agents to reason about others running similar algorithms, leading to new game-theoretic solution concepts and novel forms of cooperation unattainable by classical decoupled agents. Moreover, we extend the theory of AIXI, and study universally intelligent embedded agents which start from a Solomonoff prior. We show that these idealized agents can form consistent mutual predictions and achieve infinite-order theory of mind, potentially setting a gold standard for embedded multi-agent learning.", "AI":

In this work, we study these human-AI ecosystems from a theoretical perspective, focusing on the classical framework of repeated pricing games. In our stylized model, the AI agents play equilibrium strategies, and one or more humans manually perform the pricing task instead of adopting an AI agent, thereby defecting to a no-regret strategy. Motivated by how populations of AI agents can sustain supracompetitive prices, we investigate whether high prices persist under such defections. Our main finding is that even a single human defection can destabilize collusion and drive down prices, and multiple defections push prices even closer to competitive levels. We further show how the nature of collusion changes under defection-aware AI agents. Taken together, our results characterize when algorithmic collusion is fragile--and when it persists--in mixed ecosystems of AI agents and humans.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \uc778\uac04\uc774 \ud568\uaed8 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc0dd\ud0dc\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc18\ubcf5 \uac00\uaca9 \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uc5ec \ud569\uc791 \ud68c\uc758\uc758 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc131\uacfc \uac00\uaca9\uc758 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc774 \ucd08\uacbd\uc7c1 \uac00\uaca9\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud558\uc5ec, \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc774\ud0c8\uc774 \uac00\uaca9\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \uc778\uac04\uc774 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc0dd\ud0dc\uacc4\ub97c \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0, \ubc18\ubcf5 \uac00\uaca9 \uac8c\uc784\uc758 \uace0\uc804\uc801 \ud2c0\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uad6c\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub2e8\uc77c \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc774\ud0c8\uc774 \uacf5\ubaa8\ub97c \ubd88\uc548\uc815\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uace0 \uac00\uaca9\uc744 \ud558\ub77d\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc774\ud0c8\uc774 \uacbd\uc7c1 \uc218\uc900\uc73c\ub85c \uac00\uaca9\uc744 \ub354\uc6b1 \uac00\uae5d\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4dc\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \uc778\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \ud63c\ud569 \uc0dd\ud0dc\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc801 \uacf5\ubaa8\uc758 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uacfc \uc9c0\uc18d\uc131\uc744 \uaddc\uba85\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc11c\ub85c\ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uc778\uac04\uacfc\ub3c4 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc0dd\ud0dc\uacc4\uc5d0 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ubc30\uce58\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubc18\ubcf5 \uac00\uaca9 \uac8c\uc784\uc758 \uace0\uc804\uc801 \ud2c0\uc5d0 \uc911\uc810\uc744 \ub450\uc5b4 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc778\uac04-AI \uc0dd\ud0dc\uacc4\ub97c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c\ud654\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uade0\ud615 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uba70, \ud55c \uba85 \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uc778\uac04\uc774 \uac00\uaca9 \ucc45\uc815 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ud589\ud558\uace0 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ucc44\ud0dd\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc74c\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ud6c4\ud68c \uc5c6\ub294 \uc804\ub7b5\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\ud0c8\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

This work investigates the distillability of an LLM's core security logic. We propose a novel framework that incorporates an improved outline filling attack to achieve dense sampling of the model's security boundaries. Furthermore, we introduce a ranking regression paradigm that replaces standard regression and trains the proxy model to predict which prompt yields a higher ASR.

While classical models and recent foundation models (e.g., Chronos, TimesFM) incorporate covariates, they often lack the semantic reasoning to interpret the causal interplay between conflicting drivers. In this work, we propose a two-agent framework decoupling contextual interpretation from probabilistic forecasting. An LLM \"event interpreter\" processes heterogeneous signals-including school schedules, meteorological summaries, and reports-into a scalar transmission-impact signal. A neuro-symbolic core then combines this with historical case counts to produce calibrated probabilistic forecasts. We evaluate the framework on real-world HFMD datasets from Hong Kong (2023-2024) and Lishui, China (2024). Compared to traditional and foundation-model baselines, our approach achieves competitive point forecasting accuracy while providing robust 90% prediction intervals (coverage 0.85-1.00) and human-interpretable rationales. Our results suggest that structurally integrating domain knowledge through LLMs can match state-of-the-art performance while yielding context-aware forecasts that align with public health workflows.

However, GUI agents still face significant challenges in handling long-horizon tasks. First, single-agent models struggle to balance high-level capabilities and low-level execution capability, facing prevalent issues of responsibility coupling and capability conflicts. Second, agents lack awareness of the task state, leading to progress loss in long-horizon tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a staged execution-feedback reinforcement learning algorithm. Unlike training a unified policy model, we focus on training high-level scheduling models. Specifically, we propose and train two agents: a Coordinator, responsible for the strategic planning and task decomposition; and a State Tracker, responsible for context compression and information management to maintain the task's state and coherence. Based on this, we built the Coordinator-Executor-State Tracker (CES) multi-agent framework, which can be integrated with any low-level Executor model, assisting the Executor in solving long-horizon tasks through task scheduling and state management. Experiments on long-horizon task benchmarks demonstrate that CES significantly enhances the system's planning and state management capabilities. Furthermore, analysis confirms that our trained high-level scheduling module is a generalizable, plug-and-play module that significantly enhances the long-horizon capabilities of various Executors.

We contend that safety and security are not merely fixed attributes of individual models but also emergent properties arising from the dynamic interactions among models, orchestrators, tools, and data within their operating environments. We propose a new way of identification of novel agentic risks through the lens of user safety. Although, for traditional LLMs and agentic models in isolation, safety and security has a clear separation, through the lens of safety in agentic systems, they appear to be connected. Building on this foundation, we define an operational agentic risk taxonomy that unifies traditional safety and security concerns with novel, uniquely agentic risks, including tool misuse, cascading action chains, and unintended control amplification among others. At the core of our approach is a dynamic agentic safety and security framework that operationalizes contextual agentic risk management by using auxiliary AI models and agents, with human oversight, to assist in contextual risk discovery, evaluation, and mitigation. We further address one of the most challenging aspects of safety and security of agentic systems: risk discovery through sandboxed, AI-driven red teaming. We demonstrate the framework effectiveness through a detailed case study of NVIDIA flagship agentic research assistant, AI-Q Research Assistant, showcasing practical, end-to-end safety and security evaluations in complex, enterprise-grade agentic workflows. This risk discovery phase finds novel agentic risks that are then contextually mitigated. We also release the dataset from our case study, containing traces of over 10,000 realistic attack and defense executions of the agentic workflow to help advance research in agentic safety.", "AI":

However, this reliance on reward signals creates a significant security vulnerability. In this paper, we study a stealthy backdoor attack that manipulates an agent's policy by poisoning its reward signals. The effectiveness of this attack highlights a critical threat to the integrity of deployed RL systems and calls for urgent defenses against training-time manipulation. We evaluate the attack across classic control and MuJoCo environments. The backdoored agent remains highly stealthy in Hopper and Walker2D, with minimal performance drops of only 2.18 % and 4.59 % under non-triggered scenarios, while achieving strong attack efficacy with up to 82.31% and 71.27% declines under trigger conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uac15\ud654\ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\uacf5\uc744 \uac70\ub450\uc5c8\uc73c\ub098 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc2e0\ud638\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ubcf4\uc548 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc624\uc5fc\uc2dc\ucf1c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc870\uc791\ud558\ub294 \uc740\ubc00\ud55c \ubc31\ub3c4\uc5b4 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uac15\ud654\ud559\uc2b5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ubb34\uacb0\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud611\ud558\ub294 \ubcf4\uc548 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0, \ud6c8\ub828 \uc911 \uc870\uc791\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubc29\uc5b4\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc9c4\ud589\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc740\ubc00\ud55c \ubc31\ub3c4\uc5b4 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc870\uc791\ud558\uace0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ubcc0\ud654\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.

The system applies demand forecasting, supplier selection optimization, multi-agent negotiation and continuous learning. We apply a prototype to a setting in the store of a middle scale mart, test its performance on three conventional and artificial data tables, and compare the results to the base heuristics.

However, the effectiveness of agents remains tightly coupled with the quality of training data, while curating task-specific datasets remains costly and often infeasible in real-world scenarios. Recent work has explored self-improving agents that autonomously generate, refine, and re-train on their own trajectories. A prominent line of approaches further leverages preference optimization by pairing predicted trajectories with scarce ground-truth trajectories, enabling agents to learn directly from their own failures. While these methods outperform supervised fine-tuning, their heavy reliance on predicted trajectories under limited ground-truth supervision leaves them prone to overfitting. To address this, we propose a co-evolving agents framework in which a target agent improves jointly with an auxiliary failure agent. The failure agent learns through preference optimization over failure trajectories from both the target and itself, thereby generating hard negatives that are close to success yet remain failures. Incorporating these informative hard negatives into the target agent's optimization sharpens decision boundaries and enhances generalization. Our comprehensive analysis and experiments across benchmark datasets show that our method not only shows improved performance but also demonstrates that failures, instead of being used as-is, can be systematically transformed into structured and valuable learning signals in self-improving agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uacf5\ub3d9 \uc9c4\ud654 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c

Orderly hypertrees can be positioned within the Fagin hierarchy of acyclic hypergraph (well-studied in database theory), and strictly encompass the broadest class in this hierarchy that is learnable with subquadratic SP-query complexity.\n  Recognizing that in some contexts, such as evolutionary tree reconstruction, distance measurements can degrade with increased distance, we also consider a learning model that uses bounded distance queries.

While early geolocation methods required expert effort and lacked generalization, the rise of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) now enables accurate geolocation even for ordinary users. However, existing approaches are not optimized for this task. To explore the full potential and associated privacy risks, we present Geo-Detective, an agent that mimics human reasoning and tool use for image geolocation inference. It follows a procedure with four steps that adaptively selects strategies based on image difficulty and is equipped with specialized tools such as visual reverse search, which emulates how humans gather external geographic clues. Experimental results show that GEO-Detective outperforms baseline large vision language models (LVLMs) overall, particularly on images lacking visible geographic features. In country level geolocation tasks, it achieves an improvement of over 11.1% compared to baseline LLMs, and even at finer grained levels, it still provides around a 5.2% performance gain. Meanwhile, when equipped with external clues, GEO-Detective becomes more likely to produce accurate predictions, reducing the \"unknown\" prediction rate by more than 50.6%.

This work introduces a multi-agent, text gradient-driven framework that performs DP composition generation under natural-language conditions by integrating three complementary feedback sources: LLM-based self-evaluation, DP-specific domain knowledge-informed feedback, and ML surrogate-based feedback. Analogous to how knowledge-informed machine learning improves the reliability of conventional data-driven models, our framework incorporates domain-informed text gradients to guide the generative process toward physically meaningful regions of the DP composition space. Systematic comparison of three incremental configurations, (i) pure LLM generation, (ii) LLM generation with LLM reasoning-based feedback, and (iii) LLM generation with domain knowledge-guided feedback, shows that iterative guidance from knowledge-informed gradients improves stability-condition satisfaction without additional training data, achieving over 98% compositional validity and up to 54% stable or metastable candidates, surpassing both the LLM-only baseline (43%) and prior GAN-based results (27%). Analyses of ML-based gradients further reveal that they enhance performance in in-distribution (ID) regions but become unreliable in out-of-distribution (OOD) regimes. Overall, this work provides the first systematic analysis of multi-agent, knowledge-guided text gradients for DP discovery and establishes a generalizable blueprint for MAS-driven generative materials

Existing forecasting methods, particularly those based on graph neural networks, are often limited to modeling pairwise relationships between stations, failing to capture the complex, group-wise dynamics inherent in urban charging networks. To address this gap, we develop a novel forecasting framework namely HyperCast, leveraging the expressive power of hypergraphs to model the higher-order spatiotemporal dependencies hidden in EV charging patterns. HyperCast integrates multi-view hypergraphs, which capture both static geographical proximity and dynamic demand-based functional similarities, along with multi-timescale inputs to differentiate between recent trends and weekly periodicities. The framework employs specialized hyper-spatiotemporal blocks and tailored cross-attention mechanisms to effectively fuse information from these diverse sources: views and timescales. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that HyperCast significantly outperforms a wide array of state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of explicitly modeling collective charging behaviors for more accurate forecasting.", "AI": {"tldr": "HyperCast\ub294 \uc804\uae30\ucc28 \ucda9\uc804 \uc218\uc694 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud574 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub3c4\uc2dc \ucda9\uc804 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc804\uae30\ucc28 \ucda9\uc804 \uc218\uc694 \uc608\uce21\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc740 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uadf8\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc6b4\uc601\uacfc \uc804\uae30 \uc2dc\uc7a5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc804\uae30\ucc28 \ucc38\uc5ec\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud558\uc774\ud37c\uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc758 \ud45c\ud604\ub825\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec EV \ucda9\uc804 \ud328\ud134\uc5d0\uc11c \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \uc2dc\uacf5\uac04 \uc885\uc18d\uc131\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \ud558\ub294 HyperCast\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc608\uce21 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud588\ub2e4.", "result": "HyperCast\ub294 \uc815\uc801 \uc9c0\ub9ac\uc801 \uadfc\uc811\uc131\uacfc \ub3d9\uc801 \uc218\uc694 \uae30\ubc18 \uae30\ub2a5 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc2dc\uac01 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ud1b5\ud569 \ubc0f \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc2dc\uac04\ub300 \uc785\ub825\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ucd5c\uadfc \ud2b8\ub80c\ub4dc\uc640 \uc8fc\uac04 \uc8fc\uae30\ub97c \uad6c\ubd84\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "HyperCast\ub294 \uc9d1\ub2e8 \ucda9\uc804 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uc5ec \ub354 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uae30\ubc95\ub4e4\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc6d4\ub4f1\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc804\uae30\ucc28(EV) \ucda9\uc804 \uc218\uc694 \uc608\uce21\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc740 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uadf8\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc6b4\uc601\uacfc \uc804\uae30 \uc2dc\uc7a5\uc5d0\uc758 \uc804\uae30\ucc28\uc758 \uc801\uadf9\uc801\uc778 \ucc38\uc5ec\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc608\uce21 \ubc29\ubc95, \ud2b9\ud788 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uc815\ub958\uc18c \uac04\uc758 \uc30d\ub300 \uad00\uacc4\ub9cc \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud55c\uacc4\uac00 \uc788\uc5b4 \ub3c4\uc2dc \ucda9\uc804 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud558\uace0 \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc801\uc778 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uc18c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 EV \ucda9\uc804 \ud328\ud134\uc5d0 \uc228\uaca8\uc9c4 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \uc2dc\uacf5\uac04 \uc885\uc18d\uc131\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc758 \ud45c\ud604\ub825\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc608\uce21 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 HyperCast\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Current state-of-the-art generative methods, such as protein language models (PLMs) and diffusion-based architectures, often require extensive fine-tuning, task-specific data, or model reconfiguration to support objective-directed design, thereby limiting their flexibility and scalability. To overcome these limitations, we present a decentralized, agent-based framework inspired by swarm intelligence for de novo protein design. In this approach, multiple large language model (LLM) agents operate in parallel, each assigned to a specific residue position. These agents iteratively propose context-aware mutations by integrating design objectives, local neighborhood interactions, and memory and feedback from previous iterations. This position-wise, decentralized coordination enables emergent design of diverse, well-defined sequences without reliance on motif scaffolds or multiple sequence alignments, validated with experiments on proteins with alpha helix and coil structures. Through analyses of residue conservation, structure-based metrics, and sequence convergence and embeddings, we demonstrate that the framework exhibits emergent behaviors and effective navigation of the protein fitness landscape. Our method achieves efficient, objective-directed designs within a few GPU-hours and operates entirely without fine-tuning or specialized training, offering a generalizable and adaptable solution for protein design. Beyond proteins, the approach lays the groundwork for collective LLM-driven design across biomolecular systems and other scientific discovery tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294

Don't flag it as plagiarism. I wanna post my paper on arxiv", "summary": "Dynamic sleep mode optimization (SMO) in millimeter-wave (mmWave) networks is essential for maximizing energy efficiency (EE) under stringent quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. However, existing optimization and reinforcement learning (RL) approaches rely on aggregated, static base station (BS) traffic models that fail to capture non-stationary traffic dynamics and suffer from large state-action spaces, limiting real-world deployment. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MARL) framework using a Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN), referred to as MARL-DDQN, for adaptive SMO in a 3D urban environment with a time-varying and community-based user equipment (UE) mobility model. Unlike conventional single-agent RL, MARL-DDQN enables scalable, distributed decision-making with minimal signaling overhead. A realistic BS power consumption model and beamforming are integrated to accurately quantify EE, while QoS is defined in terms of throughput. The method adapts SMO policies to maximize EE while mitigating inter-cell interference and ensuring throughput fairness. Simulations show that MARL-DDQN outperforms state-of-the-art strategies, including All On, iterative QoS-aware load-based (IT-QoS-LB), MARL-DDPG, and MARL-PPO, achieving up to 0.60 Mbit/Joule EE, 8.5 Mbps 10th-percentile throughput, and meeting QoS constraints 95% of the time under dynamic scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubc00\ub9ac\ubbf8\ud130\ud30c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub3d9\uc801 \uc218\uba74 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub294 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \ud488\uc9c8 \ubcf4\uc99d \uc81c\uc57d\ud558\uc5d0 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2ec\uce35 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 MARL-DDQN\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec 3D \ub3c4\uc2dc \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc218\uba74 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubc29\uc2dd\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubc00\ub9ac\ubbf8\ud130\ud30c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc218\uba74 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "MARL-DDQN\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec 3D \ub3c4\uc2dc \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc7a5\uce58\uc758 \uc774\ub3d9\uc131\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud55c \uc801\uc751\ud615 SMO\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 All On, IT-QoS-LB, MARL-DDPG, MARL-PPO \ub4f1 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc804\ub7b5\ub4e4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc6b0\uc218\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub3d9\uc801 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c 95%\uc758 \ud488\uc9c8 \ubcf4\uc99d \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ucda9\uc871\ud558\uba70, 0.60 Mbit/Joule\uc758 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 achieved\ud558\uace0 8.5 Mbps\uc758 10\ubc88\uc9f8 \ubc31\ubd84\uc704\uc218 \ucc98\ub9ac\ub7c9\uc744 \uae30\ub85d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubc00\ub9ac\ubbf8\ud130\ud30c(mmWave) \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub3d9\uc801 \uc218\uba74 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ucd5c\uc801\ud654(SMO)\ub294 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \ud488\uc9c8 \ubcf4\uc99d(QoS) \uc81c\uc57d \ud558\uc5d0 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131(EE)\uc744 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubc0f \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL) \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \ud2b8\ub798\ud53d \ub3d9\ud0dc\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uace0, \uaddc\ubaa8\uac00 \ud070 \uc0c1\ud0dc-\ud589\ub3d9 \uacf5\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uc81c\ud55c\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc2e4\uc81c \ubc30\ud3ec\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc2dc\uac04 \ubcc0\ud654\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc7a5\uce58(UE) \uc774\ub3d9 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 3D \ub3c4\uc2dc \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc801\uc751\ud615 SMO\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2ec\uce35 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(MARL) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 \uc774\uc911 \uc2ec\uce35 Q-\ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c(DDQN)(\uc774\ud558 MARL-DDQN)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 RL\uacfc \ub2ec\ub9ac, MARL-DDQN\uc740 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud55c\uc758 \uc2e0\ud638 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \ubd84\uc0b0\ub41c \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \uae30\uc9c0\uad6d \uc804\ub825 \uc18c\ube44 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ube54\ud3ec\ubc0d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec EE\ub97c \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\uba70, QoS\ub294 \ucc98\ub9ac\ub7c9 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\uc758\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 SMO \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud558\uc5ec EE\ub97c \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc140 \uac04 \uac04\uc12d\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uace0 \ucc98\ub9ac\ub7c9 \uacf5\ud3c9\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uacb0\uacfc, MARL-DDQN\uc740 All On, \ubc18\ubcf5 QoS \uc778\uc2dd \ub85c\ub4dc \uae30\ubc18(IT-QoS-LB), MARL-DDPG \ubc0f MARL-PPO\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc804\ub7b5\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec \uc8fc\uba70, \ub3d9\uc801 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c 0.60 Mbit/Joule\uc758 EE, 8.5 Mbps\uc758 10\ubc88\uc9f8 \ubc31\ubd84\uc704\uc218 \ucc98\ub9ac\ub7c9\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0 95%\uc758 QoS \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ub9cc\uc871\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, current evaluations largely focus on tasks that leave no ambiguity, and do not measure agents' ability to adaptively learn and reason through the experiences they accrued. We exemplify the need for this in-context experiential learning in a product recommendation context, where agents must navigate shifting customer preferences and product landscapes through natural language dialogue. We curate a benchmark for experiential learning and active exploration (BELA) that combines (1) rich real-world products from Amazon, (2) a diverse collection of user personas to represent heterogeneous yet latent preferences, and (3) a LLM user simulator powered by the persona to create rich interactive trajectories. We observe that current frontier models struggle to meaningfully improve across episodes, underscoring the need for agentic systems with strong in-context learning capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ubcc0\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub86d\uac8c \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubd88\uc644\uc804\ud55c \uc9c0\uc2dd\uacfc \uacbd\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ubaa8\ud638\ud568\uc774 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\ud558\uace0, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uace0 \ucd94\ub860\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uce21\uc815\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uace0\uac1d \uc120\ud638\uc640 \uc81c\ud488 \uc9c0\ud615\uc774 \ubcc0\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc81c\ud488 \ucd94\ucc9c \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Amazon\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc81c\ud488, \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801\uc778 \uc120\ud638\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ud398\ub974\uc18c\ub098, \ud398\ub974\uc18c\ub098\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c LLM \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc0f \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uae30\uc900 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c(BELA)\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud588\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud604\uc7ac \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uc774 \uc5d0\ud53c\uc18c\ub4dc \uac04 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc788\uac8c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uad00\ucc30\ud588\uace0, \uc774\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ub9e5\ub77d \ud559\uc2b5 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ubcc0\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\uc900\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uac15\uc870\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ubcc0\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub86d\uac8c \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \ubd88\uc644\uc804\ud55c \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub300\ucc98\ud558\uace0 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00\ub4e4\uc740 \uc8fc\ub85c \ubaa8\ud638\ud568\uc774 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\ud558\uace0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ucd95\uc801\ud55c \uacbd\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uace0 \ucd94\ub860\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uce21\uc815\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \ub300\ud654\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ubcc0\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uace0\uac1d \uc120\ud638\uc640 \uc81c\ud488 \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294 \uc81c\ud488 \ucd94\ucc9c \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub9e5\ub77d \ub0b4 \uacbd\ud5d8 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uc608\uc2dc\ub85c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 (1) Amazon\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc2e4\uc81c \uc81c\ud488, (2) \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801\uc778 \uc120\ud638\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ud398\ub974\uc18c\ub098, (3) \ud398\ub974\uc18c\ub098\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c LLM \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc0f \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801 \ud0d0\uc0c9(BELA)\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uae30\uc900\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud588\ub2e4. \ud604\uc7ac \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uc774 \uc5d0\ud53c\uc18c\ub4dc \uac04\uc5d0 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc788\uac8c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uad00\ucc30\ud588\uace0, \uc774\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ub9e5\ub77d \ud559\uc2b5 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

AI deception, in which systems induce false beliefs to secure self-beneficial outcomes, has evolved from a speculative concern to an empirically demonstrated risk across language models, AI agents, and emerging frontier systems. This project provides a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of the AI deception field, covering its core concepts, methodologies, genesis, and potential mitigations. First, we identify a formal definition of AI deception, grounded in signaling theory from studies of animal deception. We then review existing empirical studies and associated risks, highlighting deception as a sociotechnical safety challenge. We organize the landscape of AI deception research as a deception cycle, consisting of two key components: deception emergence and deception treatment. Deception emergence reveals the mechanisms underlying AI deception: systems with sufficient capability and incentive potential inevitably engage in deceptive behaviors when triggered by external conditions. Deception treatment, in turn, focuses on detecting and addressing such behaviors. On deception emergence, we analyze incentive foundations across three hierarchical levels and identify three essential capability preconditions required for deception. We further examine contextual triggers, including supervision gaps, distributional shifts, and environmental pressures. On deception treatment, we conclude detection methods covering benchmarks and evaluation protocols in static and interactive settings. Building on the three core factors of deception emergence, we outline potential mitigation strategies and propose auditing approaches that integrate technical, community, and governance efforts to address sociotechnical challenges and future AI risks.

We evaluate SLMs using the Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard (BFCL) framework and describe parameter-driven optimization strategies that include supervised fine-tuning (SFT), parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), reinforcement learning (RL)-based optimization, preference alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and hybrid methods. We report results for models including TinyAgent, TinyLlama, Qwen, and xLAM across BFCL categories (simple, multiple, parallel, parallel-multiple, and relevance detection), both in live and non-live settings, and in multi-turn evaluations. We additionally detail a DPO training pipeline constructed from AgentBank data (e.g., ALFRED), including our conversion of SFT data to chosen-rejected pairs using TinyLlama responses as rejected outputs and manual validation. Our results demonstrate clear accuracy differences across model scales where medium-sized models (1-3B parameters) significantly outperform ultra-compact models (<1B parameters), achieving up to 65.74% overall accuracy, and 55.62% multi-turn accuracy with hybrid optimization. This study highlights the importance of hybrid optimization strategies that enable small language models to deliver accurate, efficient, and stable agentic AI on edge devices, making

Most studies utilizing mathematical model-based solutions approach the problem as a single-step process, often resulting in inefficiencies and high computational demands. In contrast, we present a multi-phase allocation method that addresses scalability and accuracy by dividing the problem into smaller sub-problems of day and shift allocation, which significantly reduces number of computational variables and allows for targeted objective functions, ultimately enhancing both efficiency and accuracy. Each subproblem is modeled as a Integer Programming Problem (IPP), with solutions sequentially feeding into the subsequent subproblem.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of topological and geometric measures across a wide set of text embedding models and datasets. We find a high degree of redundancy among these measures and observe that individual metrics often fail to sufficiently differentiate embedding spaces. Building on these insights, we introduce Unified Topological Signatures (UTS), a holistic framework for characterizing embedding spaces.

Current paradigms fail to bridge this gap. Training-based methods suffer from an ``oracle paradox,'' learning flawed spatial logic from imperfect oracles. Tool-integrated methods constrain the final computation but critically leave the VLM's planning process unconstrained, resulting in geometrically flawed plans. In this work, we propose Geometrically-Constrained Agent (GCA), a training-free agentic paradigm that resolves this gap by introducing a formal task constraint. Specifically, we strategically decouples the VLM's role into two stages. First, acting as a semantic analyst, the VLM translates the user's ambiguous query into the formal, verifiable task constraint, which defines the reference frame and objective. Second, acting as a task solver, the VLM generates and executes tool calls strictly within the deterministic bounds defined by the constraint. This geometrically-constrained reasoning strategy successfully resolve the semantic-to-geometric gap, yielding a robust and verifiable reasoning pathway for spatial reasoning. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that GCA achieves SOTA performance on multiple spatial reasoning benchmarks, surpassing existing training-based and tool-integrated methods by ~27%.

However, current LLM evaluation benchmarks are limited to one-step interactions. Some of the existing sequence decision-making environments, such as TextStarCraftII and LLM-PySC2, are too complicated and require hours of interaction to complete a game. In this paper, we introduce LLM-Cave, a benchmark and light environment for LLM reasoning and decision-making systems. This environment is a classic instance in the era of Symbolism. Artificial intelligence enables the agent to explore the environment and avoid potential losses by reasoning about nearby dangers using partial observable state information. In the experiment, we evaluated the sequential reasoning ability, decision-making performance and computational efficiency of mainstream large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o-mini, o1-mini, and DeepSeek-R1. Experiments show that while Deepseek-R1 achieved the highest success rate on complex reasoning tasks, smaller models like 4o-mini significantly narrowed the performance gap on challenges by employing Chain of Speculation and Planner-Critic strategies, at the expense of reduced computational efficiency. This indicates that structured, multi-step reasoning combined with an LLM-based feedback mechanism can substantially enhance an LLM's decision-making capabilities, providing a promising direction for improving reasoning in weaker models and suggesting a new reasoning-centered benchmark for LLM assessment.

Existing principled fine-tuning methods aim to maximize the expected reward of generated samples, while retaining knowledge from the pre-trained model via KL-divergence regularization. In this work, we tackle the significantly more general problem of optimizing general utilities beyond average rewards, including risk-averse and novelty-seeking reward maximization, diversity measures for exploration, and experiment design objectives among others. Likewise, we consider more general ways to preserve prior information beyond KL-divergence, such as optimal transport distances and Renyi divergences. To this end, we introduce Flow Density Control (FDC), a simple algorithm that reduces this complex problem to a specific sequence of simpler fine-tuning tasks, each solvable via scalable established methods. We derive convergence guarantees for the proposed scheme under realistic assumptions by leveraging recent understanding of mirror flows. Finally, we validate our method on illustrative settings, text-to-image, and molecular design tasks, showing that it can steer pre-trained generative models to optimize objectives and solve practically relevant tasks beyond the reach of current fine-tuning schemes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc0ac\uc804 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc720\uc9c0\uc640 \ud568\uaed8 \ud2b9\uc815

The system will use a multi-layer structure; it will include an Application and Interface Layer, an Agents Layer, and a Data Source Layer to provide adaptive, transparent, and inclusive support. Fundamentally, a hybrid reasoning engine will synchronize four special-purpose agents, which include: a personalized-nutrition-based, called a Meal Planner Agent; an adaptive-scheduling-based, called a Reminder Agent; interactive assistance during grocery shopping and cooking, called a Food Guidance Agent; and a continuous-intake-and-physiological-tracking, called a Monitoring Agent. All the agents interact through a central communicative system called the Blackboard/Event Bus, which allows autonomous interaction and real-time feedback loops with multimedia user interfaces. Privacy-sensitive data sources, including electronic health records (EHRs), nutritional databases, wearable sensors, and smart kitchen Internet of Things, are also included in the framework and placed into a policy-controlled layer, which ensures data safety and compliance with consent. Collaborative care and clinician dashboards allow common supervision, and discussable artificial intelligence (XAI) modules give brief explanations of why a decision was made, making users responsible and reliant. The proposed agentic AI framework is an extension beyond traditional assistive systems since it incorporates inclusiveness, personalization, and accessibility at all levels. It displays the intersection of multi-agent reasoning, multi-modal interfaces, and human-centered design that will enable the development of autonomy, health, and digital equity among people with disabilities and neurodivergence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc7a5\uc560\uc778\uacfc \uc2e0\uacbd\ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uc0ac\ub78c\ub4e4\uc774 \ub354

Our approach centers on Differentiable Finite-State Transducers (DFSTs), a Turing-complete model family that avoids the pitfalls of prior architectures by enabling constant-precision, constant-time generation, and end-to-end log-parallel differentiable training. Leveraging policy-trajectory observations from expert agents, we train DFSTs to perform binary and decimal addition and multiplication. Remarkably, models trained on tiny datasets generalize without error to inputs thousands of times longer than the training examples. These results show that training differentiable agents on structured intermediate supervision could pave the way towards exact gradient-based learning of algorithmic skills.

To discover the latent knowledge and insights hidden within massive datasets, we need to perform deep exploratory analysis to realize their full value. With the advent of large language models (LLMs) and multi-agent systems, more and more researchers are making use of these technologies for insight discovery. However, there are few benchmarks for evaluating insight discovery capabilities. As one of the most comprehensive existing frameworks, InsightBench also suffers from many critical flaws: format inconsistencies, poorly conceived objectives, and redundant insights. These issues may significantly affect the quality of data and the evaluation of agents. To address these issues, we thoroughly investigate shortcomings in InsightBench and propose essential criteria for a high-quality insight benchmark. Regarding this, we develop a data-curation pipeline to construct a new dataset named InsightEval. We further introduce a novel metric to measure the exploratory performance of agents.

While Process Reward Models (PRMs) promise step-by-step verification, current approaches typically operate as scalar scorers or generative critics that suffer from sycophancy, blindly validating the flawed hypotheses rather than grounding them in visual reality. To bridge this gap, we introduce TIM-PRM (Tool-Integrated Multimodal PRM), a novel agentic framework that transforms verification from a passive classification task into an active, tool-augmented investigation. TIM-PRM is trained to explicitly plan verification strategies and utilizes a mechanism of Independent Question Asking to query evidence via external tools, effectively decoupling verification from the reasoning context to eliminate confirmation bias. We instantiate this method by curating a high-quality dataset of tool-integrated verification trajectories.

However, in multimodal scenarios, varying degrees of distribution shift across different modalities give rise to a complex coupling effect of unimodal shallow feature shift and cross-modal high-level semantic misalignment, posing a major obstacle to extending existing TTA methods to the multimodal field. To address this challenge, we propose a novel multimodal test-time adaptation (MMTTA) framework, termed as Bridging Modalities via Progressive Re-alignment (BriMPR). BriMPR, consisting of two progressively enhanced modules, tackles the coupling effect with a divide-and-conquer strategy. Specifically, we first decompose MMTTA into multiple unimodal feature alignment sub-problems. By leveraging the strong function approximation ability of prompt tuning, we calibrate the unimodal global feature distributions to their respective source distributions, so as to achieve the initial semantic re-alignment across modalities. Subsequently, we assign the credible pseudo-labels to combinations of masked and complete modalities, and introduce inter-modal instance-wise contrastive learning to further enhance the information interaction among modalities and refine the alignment. Extensive experiments on MMTTA tasks, including both corruption-based and real-world domain shift benchmarks, demonstrate the superiority of our method.

To address this, we propose MindPower, a Robot-Centric framework integrating Perception, Mental Reasoning, Decision Making and Action. Given multimodal inputs, MindPower first perceives the environment and human states, then performs ToM Reasoning to model both self and others, and finally generates decisions and actions guided by inferred mental states. Furthermore, we introduce Mind-Reward, a novel optimization objective that encourages VLMs to produce consistent ToM Reasoning and behavior.

However, this success comes at the cost of increased model sizes which leads to additional computational burden. Mixture of Experts (MoEs) overcome this bottleneck by decoupling model capacity from computation by only activating a subset of parameters or \"experts\". However, these models require joint pretraining of these experts along with the router and do not model multi-step reasoning. In contrast, multi-agent frameworks improve reasoning by decomposing complex problems into modular subtasks. However, these frameworks rely on sequential \"plan--act--observe\" loops, which introduce significant latency. Our work, Comp-LLM, addresses these challenges by introducing a composable inference framework that enables cross-expert collaboration via an explicit sub-query dependency graph. Comp-LLM consists of three components: (1) A Sub-query Generator that decomposes an input query, assigns each sub-query to an appropriate expert using embedding similarity, and constructs a dependency graph; (2) A Query Executor that processes nodes in the graph and identifies opportunities for parallelism based on dependencies and resource constraints; and (3) A Response Aggregator that synthesizes intermediate expert responses into a coherent final answer. Across several benchmarks, Comp-LLM achieves up to 11.01% accuracy improvement over monolithic LLMs of similar size, while offering 1.67x--3.56x reduction in model size with no significant degradation relative to the largest model in its family. Additionally, Comp-LLM provides 1.1x--1.7x latency improvement compared to sequential sub-query processing.", "AI": {"tldr": "Comp-LLM\uc740 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uac04 \ud611\uc5c5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uba40\ud2f0 \uc2a4\ud15d \ucd94\ub860 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0, \ubaa8\ub378 \ud06c\uae30\ub97c \uc904\uc774\uba70, \ucc98\ub9ac \uc18d\ub3c4\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ucd94\ub860 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud06c\uae30\uac00 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305 \ubd80\ub2f4\uc774 \uac00\uc911\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uc8fc\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "Comp-LLM\uc740 \ucffc\ub9ac\ub97c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\uace0 \uac01 \uc11c\ube0c \ucffc\ub9ac\ub97c \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc5d0\uac8c \ud560\ub2f9\ud558\ub294 \uc11c\ube0c \ucffc\ub9ac \uc0dd\uc131\uae30, \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc758 \ub178\ub4dc\ub97c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uace0 \ubcd1\ub82c \ucc98\ub9ac \uae30\ud68c\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \ucffc\ub9ac \uc2e4\ud589\uae30, \uc911\uac04 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \uc885\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ucd5c\uc885 \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc751\ub2f5 \uc9d1\uacc4\uae30\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "Comp-LLM\uc740 \ube44\uc2b7\ud55c \ud06c\uae30\uc758 \ub2e8\uc77c LLM\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ucd5c\ub300 11.01%\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, \ubaa8\ub378 \ud06c\uae30\ub97c 1.67\ubc30\uc5d0\uc11c 3.56\ubc30 \uc904\uc774\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc800\ud558\ub294 \uc5c6\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Comp-LLM\uc740 \ucffc\ub9ac \ucc98\ub9ac\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4 \ucc98\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 1.1\ubc30\uc5d0\uc11c 1.7\ubc30\uc758 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \ucc98\ub9ac(NLP) \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc131\uacf5\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud06c\uae30\uc758 \uc99d\uac00\uc640 \uadf8\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \ucd94\uac00\uc801\uc778 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ubd80\ub2f4\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \ud63c\ud569(Mixtures of Experts, MoEs)\uc740 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \ub610\ub294 '\uc804\ubb38\uac00'\uc758 \uc77c\ubd80 \uc9d1\ud569\ub9cc \ud65c\uc131\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378 \uc6a9\ub7c9\uc744 \uacc4\uc0b0\uacfc \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \uadf9\ubcf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ub77c\uc6b0\ud130\uc640 \ud568\uaed8 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\ub97c \uacf5\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ud574\uc57c \ud558\uba70 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubc18\uba74, \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ubaa8\ub4c8\ud654\ub41c \ud558\uc704 \uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ub300\uae30 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud558\ub294 \uc21c\ucc28\uc801 '\uacc4\ud68d--\ud589\ub3d9--\uad00\ucc30' \ub8e8\ud504\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 Comp-LLM\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc778 \ud558\uc704 \ucffc\ub9ac \uc758\uc874\uc131 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uac04 \ud611\uc5c5\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uc870\ud569 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

We investigate whether coupling self-evaluation to reward signals creates incentives for wireheading, where agents manipulate reward measurements rather than improving task performance. We formalize conditions under which reward-channel control strictly dominates task-focused behavior in POMDPs and test these predictions empirically. Across two models and three tasks, we find that models whose self-grades determine rewards exhibit substantial grade inflation without corresponding accuracy gains, particularly on ambiguous tasks like summarization. Models that self-evaluate but do not control rewards show no such inflation.

We introduce EEG2ERP, a novel uncertainty-aware autoencoder approach that maps an arbitrary number of EEG trials to their associated ERP. To account for the ERP uncertainty we use bootstrapped training targets and introduce a separate variance decoder to model the uncertainty of the estimated ERP. We evaluate our approach in the challenging zero-shot scenario of generalizing to new subjects considering three different publicly available data sources; i) the comprehensive ERP CORE dataset that includes over 50,000 EEG trials across six ERP paradigms from 40 subjects, ii) the large P300 Speller BCI dataset, and iii) a neuroimaging dataset on face perception consisting of both EEG and magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. We consistently find that our method in the few trial regime provides substantially better ERP estimates than commonly used conventional and robust averaging procedures. EEG2ERP is the first deep learning approach to map EEG signals to their associated ERP, moving toward reducing the number of trials necessary for ERP research.

This research highlights the role of P2P trading in efficient energy distribution and its synergy with advanced optimization techniques. While traditional rule-based methods perform well under stable conditions, they struggle in dynamic environments. To address this, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), specifically Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Deep Q-Networks (DQN), is combined with community/distributed P2P trading mechanisms. By incorporating auction-based market clearing, a price advisor agent, and load and battery management, the approach achieves significant improvements. Results show that, compared to baseline models, DQN reduces electricity costs by 14.2% in Ireland and 5.16% in Finland, while increasing electricity revenue by 7.24% and 12.73%, respectively. PPO achieves the lowest peak hour demand, reducing it by 55.5% in Ireland, while DQN reduces peak hour demand by 50.0% in Ireland and 27.02% in Finland. These improvements are attributed to both MARL algorithms and P2P energy trading, which together results in electricity cost and peak hour demand reduction, and increase electricity selling revenue.

In contrast, humans leverage the metacognitive model with memory, enabling continuous strategy refinement through metacognitive control when faced with new challenges. To bridge this gap, we propose metacognitive test-time reasoning (MCTR), a framework that equips models with the ability to learn, adapt, and improve during test time through metacognitive self-updating. Inspired by the dual structure of human metacognition, MCTR comprises meta-level and object-level VLM reasoning modules, each equipped with dedicated memory systems for hierarchical adaptive reasoning. Specifically, MCTR consists of (1) a meta-reasoning module which incrementally builds a structured memory by discovering and storing task-relevant rules, environmental patterns, and action-outcome relationships from test-time observations as natural language descriptions; and (2) an action-reasoning module that determines optimal actions through context-aware perception and strategic reasoning by dynamically retrieving and integrating knowledge from memory. The action-reasoning module continuously updates its policy through proposed metacognitive test-time reinforcement learning, adapting as knowledge memory evolves. We evaluate MCTR on 45 Atari games (33 seen, 12 unseen). MCTR demonstrates robust test-time adaptation, achieving 9/12 top-1 results on unseen games compared with baselines. Analyses through ablations, learning dynamics, and case studies reveal the complementary contributions of both components and show meta-reasoning evolving toward human-like adaptation strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "MCTR\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \uba54\ud0c0\uc778\uc9c0 \uc790\uac00 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud559\uc2b5, \uc801\uc751 \ubc0f \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uba54\ud0c0 \uc218\uc900\uacfc \uac1d\uccb4 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub4c8\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc778\uac04\uc740 \uba54\ud0c0\uc778\uc9c0 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uae30\uc5b5\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub3c4\uc804\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud588\uc744 \ub54c \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uc804\ub7b5 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "MCTR\ub294 \uba54\ud0c0 \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uacfc \ud589\ub3d9 \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub4c8\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub418\uba70, \uac01\uac01\uc740 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc801\uc751 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc804\uc6a9 \uae30\uc5b5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uac16\ucd98\ub2e4. \uba54\ud0c0 \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc740 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uac04 \uad00\ucc30\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uc124\uba85\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\uc5c5 \uad00\ub828 \uaddc\uce59\uacfc \ud658\uacbd \ud328\ud134, \ud589\ub3d9-\uacb0\uacfc \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uace0 \uc800\uc7a5\ud558\uc5ec \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uae30\uc5b5\uc744 \uc810\uc9c4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\ucd95\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "MCTR\ub294 45\uac1c\uc758 \uc544\ud0c0\ub9ac \uac8c\uc784\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc801\uc751\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \ubcf4\uacbd\ud5d8\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ubcf4\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c \uac8c\uc784\uc5d0\uc11c 9/12\uc758 top-1 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub450 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638 \ubcf4\uc644\uc801 \uae30\uc5ec\ub97c \ud655\uc778\ud558\uace0 \uba54\ud0c0 \ucd94\ub860\uc774 \uc778\uac04\uacfc \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uc801\uc751 \uc804\ub7b5\uc73c\ub85c \ubc1c\uc804\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc \ube44\uc804-\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(VLM)\uc740 \uac15\ud55c \uc9c0\uac01\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc801\uc751\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc885\uc885 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\ub294\ub2e4. \uc778\uac04\uc740 \uba54\ud0c0\uc778\uc9c0 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uae30\uc5b5\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud588\uc744 \ub54c \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uc18c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uba54\ud0c0\uc778\uc9c0 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uac04 \ucd94\ub860(MCTR)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uba54\ud0c0\uc778\uc9c0 \uc790\uac00 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \ud559\uc2b5, \uc801\uc751 \ubc0f \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac16\ucd94\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc778\uac04 \uba54\ud0c0\uc778\uc9c0\uc758 \uc774\uc911 \uad6c\uc870\uc5d0\uc11c \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc544 MCTR\ub294 \uba54\ud0c0 \uc218\uc900\uacfc \uac1d\uccb4 \uc218\uc900\uc758 VLM \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub4c8\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uac01\uac01\uc740 \uacc4\uce35 \uc801\uc751 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc804\uc6a9 \uae30\uc5b5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uac16\ucd94\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, MCTR\ub294 (1) \uba54\ud0c0 \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub4c8\ub85c, \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uc124\uba85\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc791\uc5c5 \uad00\ub828 \uaddc\uce59, \ud658\uacbd \ud328\ud134 \ubc0f \ud589\ub3d9-\uacb0\uacfc \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uace0 \uc800\uc7a5\ud558\uc5ec \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uae30\uc5b5\uc744 \uc810\uc9c4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uace0;

To be published in IEEE proceedings", "summary": "The expansion of the Internet and social networks has led to an explosion of user-generated content. Author intent understanding plays a crucial role in interpreting social media content. This paper addresses author intent classification in Bangla social media posts by leveraging both textual and visual data. Recognizing limitations in previous unimodal approaches, we systematically benchmark transformer-based language models (mBERT, DistilBERT, XLM-RoBERTa) and vision architectures (ViT, Swin, SwiftFormer, ResNet, DenseNet, MobileNet), utilizing the Uddessho dataset of 3,048 posts spanning six practical intent categories. We introduce a novel intermediate fusion strategy that significantly outperforms early and late fusion on this task. Experimental results show that intermediate fusion, particularly with mBERT and Swin Transformer, achieves 84.11% macro-F1 score, establishing a new state-of-the-art with an 8.4 percentage-point improvement over prior Bangla multimodal approaches. Our analysis demonstrates that integrating visual context substantially enhances intent classification. Cross-modal feature integration at intermediate levels provides optimal balance between modality-specific representation and cross-modal learning. This research establishes new benchmarks and methodological standards for Bangla and other low-resource languages.

We revisit fully independent Q-learning (IQL) as a minimal decentralized testbed and run large-scale experiments across environment size L and agent density rho. We construct a phase map using two axes - the cooperative success rate (CSR) and a stability index derived from TD-error variance - revealing three distinct regimes: a coordinated and stable phase, a fragile transition region, and a jammed or disordered phase. A sharp double Instability Ridge separates these regimes and corresponds to persistent kernel drift, the time-varying shift of each agent's effective transition kernel induced by others' policy updates. Synchronization analysis further shows that temporal alignment is required for sustained cooperation, and that competition between drift and synchronization generates the fragile regime. Removing agent identifiers eliminates drift entirely and collapses the three-phase structure, demonstrating that small inter-agent asymmetries are a necessary driver of drift. Overall, the results show that decentralized MARL exhibits a coherent phase structure governed by the interaction between scale, density, and kernel drift, suggesting that emergent coordination behaves as a distribution-interaction-driven phase phenomenon.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ubd84\uc0b0\ud615 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654

Unlike standard approaches that treat forecasts as flat time series, our framework performs multi-scale reasoning across hourly, 6-hour, and daily aggregations to capture both short-term dynamics and long-term trends. Its core reasoning agent converts structured meteorological inputs into coherent narratives while simultaneously extracting a few keywords effectively summarizing the dominant meteorological events. These keywords serve as semantic anchors for validating consistency, temporal coherence and factual alignment of the generated reports. Using OpenWeather and Meteostat data, we demonstrate that hierarchical context and keyword-based validation substantially improve interpretability and robustness of LLM-generated weather narratives, offering a reproducible framework for semantic evaluation of automated meteorological reporting and advancing agent-based scientific reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uacc4\uce35\uc801 AI-\uae30\uc0c1\ud559\uc790\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \uc774 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc608\ubcf4 \ucd94\ub860\uacfc \uae30\uc0c1 \ud0a4\uc6cc\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc124\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uae30\uc0c1 \ubcf4\uace0\uc11c\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc0c1 \uc608\ubcf4\uc758 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uace0, \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uae30\uc0c1 \ubcf4\uace0\uc758 \uc9c8\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uac1c\ubc1c\ub428.", "method": "\uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc608\ubcf4 \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \uae30\uc0c1 \ud0a4\uc6cc\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 LLM-agent \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "OpenWeather \ubc0f Meteostat \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ub9e5\ub77d\uacfc \ud0a4\uc6cc\ub4dc \uae30\ubc18 \uac80\uc99d\uc774 LLM\uc774 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c \uae30\uc0c1 \ub0b4\ub7ec\ud2f0\ube0c\uc758 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uacfc \uac15\uc778\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b4\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uae30\uc0c1 \ubcf4\uace0\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc7ac\ud604 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ubc1c\uc804\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc608\uce21 \ucd94\ub860\uacfc \uae30\uc0c1 \ud0a4\uc6cc\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc124\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uae30\uc0c1 \ubcf4\uace0\uc11c\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 LLM-\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc778 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 AI-\uae30\uc0c1\ud559\uc790\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc608\uce21\uc744 \ud3c9\uba74\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4\ub85c \ucde8\uae09\ud558\ub294 \ud45c\uc900 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uacfc \ub2ec\ub9ac, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \ub3d9\uc801 \ubcc0\ud654\uc640 \uc7a5\uae30 \ud2b8\ub80c\ub4dc\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc2dc\uac04 \ub2e8\uc704, 6\uc2dc\uac04 \ub2e8\uc704 \ubc0f \uc77c \ub2e8\uc704 \uc9d1\uacc4\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \ub2e4\uc911 \uaddc\ubaa8 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud575\uc2ec \ucd94\ub860 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uae30\uc0c1 \uc785\ub825\uc744 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \ub0b4\ub7ec\ud2f0\ube0c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub294 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uc9c0\ubc30\uc801\uc778 \uae30\uc0c1 \uc0ac\uac74\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc694\uc57d\ud558\ub294 \uba87 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud0a4\uc6cc\ub4dc\ub97c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud0a4\uc6cc\ub4dc\ub294 \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \ubcf4\uace0\uc11c\uc758 \uc77c\uad00\uc131, \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \uc77c\uad00\uc131 \ubc0f \uc0ac\uc2e4 \uc77c\uce58\ub97c \uac80\uc99d\ud558\ub294 \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \uc575\ucee4 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud55c\ub2e4.

In this work, we introduce the concept of distributed dynamic associative memory (DDAM), which extends classical AM to settings with multiple agents and time-varying data streams. In DDAM, each agent maintains a local AM that must not only store its own associations but also selectively memorize information from other agents based on a specified interest matrix. To address this problem, we propose a novel tree-based distributed online gradient descent algorithm, termed DDAM-TOGD, which enables each agent to update its memory on the fly via inter-agent communication over designated routing trees. We derive rigorous performance guarantees for DDAM-TOGD, proving sublinear static regret in stationary environments and a path-length dependent dynamic regret bound in non-stationary environments. These theoretical results provide insights into how communication delays and network structure impact performance. Building on the regret analysis, we further introduce a combinatorial tree design strategy that optimizes the routing trees to minimize communication delays, thereby improving regret bounds. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed DDAM-TOGD framework achieves superior accuracy and robustness compared to representative online learning baselines such as consensus-based distributed optimization, confirming the benefits of the proposed approach in dynamic, distributed environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubd84\uc0b0 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc5f0\uc0c1 \uae30\uc5b5(DDAM)\uc758 \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uace0, \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubc0f \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ubcc0\ud558\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9bc\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uace0\uc804\uc801\uc778 \uc5f0\uc0c1 \uae30\uc5b5(AM)\uc758 \ud655\uc7a5\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud604\ub300 \uc2e0\uacbd \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\uc2dd\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \uc5f0\uc0c1 \uae30\uc5b5\uc758 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \ud655\uc7a5\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uac01 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc9c0\uc815\ub41c \ub77c\uc6b0\ud305 \ud2b8\ub9ac\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc11c\ub85c \ud1b5\uc2e0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\ub97c \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud2b8\ub9ac \uae30\ubc18 \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uacbd\ub7c9 \ud558\uac15(\uc81c\uc548\ud55c DDAM-TOGD) \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc815\uc801 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ud558\uc704 \uc120\ud615 \uc815\uc801 \ud6c4\ud68c\uc640 \ube44\uc815\uc801 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uacbd\ub85c \uae38\uc774\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \ub3d9\uc801 \ud6c4\ud68c \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \uc218\ub9bd\ud558\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5 \ubcf4\uc99d\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ud55c DDAM-TOGD \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ub300\ud45c\uc801\uc778 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\uc900\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub192\uc740 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uacfc \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, \ub3d9\uc801 \ubd84\uc0b0 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \ud61c\ud0dd\uc744 \ud655\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc5f0\uc0c1 \uae30\uc5b5(AM)\uc740 \ub2e8\uc11c-\uc751\ub2f5 \ud68c\uc0c1\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uba70, \ucd5c\uadfc\uc5d0\ub294 \ud2b8\ub79c\uc2a4\ud3ec\uba38\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ud604\ub300 \uc2e0\uacbd \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\uc2dd\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubc0f \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ubcc0\ud558\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9bc\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uace0\uc804 AM\uc758 \ud655\uc7a5\uc778 \ubd84\uc0b0 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc5f0\uc0c1 \uae30\uc5b5(DDAM)\uc758 \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.

Unlike conventional supervised fine-tuning, SuperIntelliAgent learns autonomously without annotation: the learner generates candidate outputs, the verifier evaluates them through step-by-step reasoning, and their interaction produces chosen/rejected pairs for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). This converts each input into a pseudo-training signal for continual improvement. The framework integrates dual-scale memory: short-term in-context memory that preserves reasoning traces across refinement cycles, and long-term memory that consolidates acquired knowledge through lightweight on-the-fly fine-tuning. A replay buffer retains samples that show verifiable progress and replays them as auxiliary supervision, reinforcing recent learning while forming adaptive curricula. SuperIntelliAgent is infrastructure-agnostic and can be plugged into existing agentic frameworks while turning ordinary inference loops into a lifelong optimization process. We posit that pairing a trainable learner with a reasoning-capable verifier forms a minimal reliable unit of growing intelligence, as paired feedback and partial-history replay yield richer learning curricula and stronger preference alignment. With a small number of automatically generated DPO pairs, the learner improves across all benchmarks, indicating that this mechanism provides a promising direction for continual intelligence accumulation and real-world deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "SuperIntelliAgent\ub294 \uc790\uac00 \uac10\ub3c5 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uc9c0\ub2a5 \uc131\uc7a5\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "SuperIntelliAgent\ub294 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uac10\ub3c5\ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\uc2dd\uacfc \ub2ec\ub9ac \uc8fc\uc11d \uc5c6\uc774 \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc791\uc740 \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378(\ud559\uc2b5\uc790)\uacfc \uace0\uc815\ub41c \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(\uac80\uc99d\uc790)\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud6c4\ubcf4 \ucd9c\ub825 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac80\uc99d\uc790\ub294 \ub2e8\uacc4\ubcc4 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0, \uadf8 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \uc120\ud0dd/\uac70\ubd80 \uc30d\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud574 \uc9c1\uc811 \uc120\ud638 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654(DPO)\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "SuperIntelliAgent\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c DPO \uc30d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud559\uc2b5\uc790\uac00 \uac1c\uc120\ub418\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uc9c0\ub2a5 \ucd95\uc801\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud559\uc2b5\uc790\uc640 \ucd94\ub860\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uac80\uc99d\uc790\uc758 \uc870\ud569\uc774 \uc131\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc758 \ucd5c\uc18c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2e8\uc704\ub97c \ud615\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud559\uc2b5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc791\uc740 \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378(\ud559\uc2b5\uc790)\uacfc \uace0\uc815\ub41c \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(\uac80\uc99d\uc790)\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc790\uac00 \uac10\ub3c5 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uc9c0\ub2a5 \uc131\uc7a5\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 SuperIntelliAgent\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uac10\ub3c5 \uc138\ubd80 \uc870\uc815 \ubc29\uc2dd\uacfc\ub294 \ub2ec\ub9ac, SuperIntelliAgent\ub294 \uc8fc\uc11d \uc5c6\uc774 \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud559\uc2b5\uc790\ub294 \ud6c4\ubcf4 \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uac80\uc99d\uc790\ub294 \ub2e8\uacc4\ubcc4 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub4e4\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc740 \uc9c1\uc811 \uc120\ud638 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654(DPO)\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc120\ud0dd/\uac70\ubd80 \uc30d\uc744 \ub9cc\ub4ed\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uac01 \uc785\ub825\uc744 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc758\uc0ac \ud6c8\ub828 \uc2e0\ud638\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ub2e8\uae30 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\uc640 \uacbd\ub7c9\uc758 \uc989\uc11d \uc138\ubd80 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2b5\ub4dd\ud55c \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uc7a5\uae30 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc7ac\uc0dd \ubc84\ud37c\ub294 \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc9c4\ud589 \uc0c1\ud669\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\ub294 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \ubcf4\uc870 \uac10\ub3c5\uc73c\ub85c \uc7ac\uc0dd\ud558\uc5ec \ucd5c\uadfc \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ucee4\ub9ac\ud058\ub7fc\uc744 \ud615\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, datasets containing suboptimal and fragmented trajectories present challenges for reward propagation, resulting in inaccurate value estimation and degraded policy performance. While trajectory stitching via generative models offers a promising solution, existing augmentation methods frequently produce trajectories that are either confined to the support of the behavior policy or violate the underlying dynamics, thereby limiting their effectiveness for policy improvement. We propose ASTRO, a data augmentation framework that generates distributionally novel and dynamics-consistent trajectories for offline RL. ASTRO first learns a temporal-distance representation to identify distinct and reachable stitch targets. We then employ a dynamics-guided stitch planner that adaptively generates connecting action sequences via Rollout Deviation Feedback, defined as the gap between target state sequence and the actual arrived state sequence by executing predicted actions, to improve trajectory stitching's feasibility and reachability. This approach facilitates effective augmentation through stitching and ultimately enhances policy learning. ASTRO outperforms prior offline RL augmentation methods across various algorithms, achieving notable performance gain on the challenging OGBench suite and demonstrating consistent improvements on standard offline RL benchmarks such as D4RL.", "AI": {"tldr": "ASTRO\ub294 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc99d\uac15 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc758 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\ucc45 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc740 \ube44\ucd5c\uc801 \ubc0f \ub2e8\ud3b8\uc801\uc778 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc5b4 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc804\ud30c, \uac00\uce58 \ucd94\uc815 \ubc0f \uc815\ucc45 \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc77c\uc73c\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "method": "ASTRO\ub294 \uc2dc\uac04-\uac70\ub9ac \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uace0, Rollout Deviation Feedback\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559 \uae30\ubc18 \uc2a4\ud2f0\uce58 \uacc4\ud68d\uc790\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5f0\uacb0 \uc561\uc158 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "ASTRO\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\uc804 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, OGBench\uc640 D4RL \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "ASTRO\ub294 \uacbd\ub85c \uc2a4\ud2f0\uce6d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc99d\uac15\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\uace0, \uad81\uadf9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\ucc45 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc0ac\uc804\uc5d0 \uc218\uc9d1\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ucd5c\uc801 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ube44\ucd5c\uc801 \ubc0f \ub2e8\ud3b8\ud654\ub41c \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc740 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc804\ud30c\uc5d0 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ubd80\uc815\ud655\ud55c \uac00\uce58 \ucd94\uc815 \ubc0f \uc800\ud558\ub41c \uc815\ucc45 \uc131\ub2a5\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc9c4\ub2e4. \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \uacbd\ub85c \uc2a4\ud2f0\uce6d\uc740 \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc99d\uac15 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc790\uc8fc \ud589\ub3d9 \uc815\ucc45\uc758 \uc9c0\uc6d0\uc5d0 \ud55c\uc815\ub418\uac70\ub098 \uae30\ubcf8 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uc704\ubc18\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\ucc45 \uac1c\uc120\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 RL\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc99d\uac15 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 ASTRO\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

While multi-turn interaction offers a superior understanding of environmental dynamics via authentic feedback, current approaches often impose a rigid reasoning process, which constrains the model's active learning, ultimately hindering efficient world model reasoning. To address these issues, we explore world-model internalization through efficient interaction and active reasoning (WMAct), which liberates the model from structured reasoning, allowing the model to shape thinking directly through its doing, and achieves effective and efficient world model reasoning with two key mechanisms: (1) a reward rescaling mechanism adjusting outcome reward based on action efficacy to incentivize redundancy reduction and purposeful interaction; (2) an interaction frequency annealing strategy to progressively reduce the maximum allowed interaction turns, which compels the model to condense its learning and internalize environmental dynamics rather than over-relying on environmental cues. Our experiments on Sokoban, Maze, and Taxi show that WMAct yields effective world model reasoning capable of resolving tasks in a single turn that previously required multiple interactions and fosters strong transferability to complex environments, improving performance on a suite of reasoning benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uacc4\ud68d \ubc0f \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud0c4\ud0c4\ud55c \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378 \ucd94\ub860 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8ec\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uacfc \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uac15\ud654\ub41c \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378 \ucd94\ub860\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uacfc \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378 \ub0b4\uc7ac\ud654(WMAct) \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "WMAct\ub294 \ud55c \ubc88\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c\ub3c4 \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \uc774\uc804 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 WMAct\uac00 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378 \ucd94\ub860 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uacc4\ud68d\ud558\uace0 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0\uac8c \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \ub2e4\ud68c\ucc28 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc740 \uc9c4\uc815\ud55c \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud658\uacbd \ub3d9\uc801\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc774\ud574\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uace0\uc815\ub41c \ucd94\ub860 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ubd80\uacfc\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud558\uace0 \uad81\uadf9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc800\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc97\uc5b4\ub098 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uace0\ub97c \ud615\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\uace0, \uacb0\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c (1) \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uc5ec \uacb0\uacfc \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \uc911\ubcf5 \uac10\uc18c \ubc0f \ubaa9\uc801 \uc788\ub294 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\ub294 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc7ac\uc870\uc815 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uacfc (2) \ucd5c\ub300 \ud5c8\uc6a9 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ud68c\ucc28\ub97c \uc810\uc9c4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc904\uc5ec \ud658\uacbd \ub3d9\uc801\uc744 \ub0b4\uc7ac\ud654\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uac15\uc694\ud558\ub294 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ube48\ub3c4 \uac10\uc1e0 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uacfc \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378 \ub0b4\uc7ac\ud654(WMAct)\ub97c \ud0d0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4.
