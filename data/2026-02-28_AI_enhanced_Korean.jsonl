We cast blockchain configuration as a multiagent resource-allocation problem: applications and operators declare demand, capacity, and price bounds; an optimizer groups them into ephemeral chains each epoch and sets a chain-level clearing price. The objective maximizes a governance-weighted combination of normalized utilities for applications, operators, and the system. The model is modular -- accommodating capability compatibility, application-type diversity, and epoch-to-epoch stability -- and can be solved off-chain with outcomes verifiable on-chain. We analyze fairness and incentive issues and present simulations that highlight trade-offs among throughput, decentralization, operator yield, and service stability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ube14\ub85d\uccb4\uc778 \uad6c\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uba40\ud2f0\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc790\uc6d0 \ud560\ub2f9 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uac70\ub798\ucc98\ub9ac\uc640 \uc790\uc6d0 \ubc30\ubd84\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc.", "motivation": "\ube14\ub85d\uccb4\uc778\uc740 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \uac70\ub798 \ucc98\ub9ac\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\uac00 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uba40\ud2f0\uccb4\uc778 \uc124\uacc4\ub294 \uc218\uc694\uc640 \uc6a9\ub7c9\uc758 \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \uc815\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uacfc \uc6b4\uc601\uc790\uac00 \uc218\uc694, \uc6a9\ub7c9, \uac00\uaca9 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uc120\uc5b8\ud558\uba70, \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ub3c4\uad6c\uac00 \ub9e4 \uc5d0\ud3ec\ud06c\ub9c8\ub2e4 \uc774\ub4e4\uc744 \uc784\uc2dc \uccb4\uc778\uc73c\ub85c \uadf8\ub8f9\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uccb4\uc778 \ub808\ubca8 \uccad\uc0b0 \uac00\uaca9\uc744 \uc124\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ud615\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158, \uc6b4\uc601\uc790, \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc815\uaddc\ud654\ub41c \ud6a8\uc6a9\uc758 \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4 \uac00\uc911 \uc870\ud569\uc744 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc774\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubaa8\ub4c8\ud654\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uae30\ub2a5 \ud638\ud658\uc131, \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158 \uc720\ud615\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131, \uc5d0\ud3ec\ud06c \uac04 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \uc218\uc6a9\ud558\uba70, \uc624\ud504\uccb4\uc778\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uace0 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc628\uccb4\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uac80\uc99d\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ube14\ub85d\uccb4\uc778\uc740 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \uac70\ub798 \ucc98\ub9ac\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uadf8 \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc774\uba70, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uba40\ud2f0\uccb4\uc778 \uc124\uacc4\ub294 \uc218\uc694\uc640 \uc6a9\ub7c9\uc774 \ubcc0\ud654\ud558\ub354\ub77c\ub3c4 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ube14\ub85d\uccb4\uc778 \uad6c\uc131\uc744 \uba40\ud2f0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc790\uc6d0 \ud560\ub2f9 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uac04\uc8fc\ud55c\ub2e4: \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uacfc \uc6b4\uc601\uc790\ub294 \uc218\uc694, \uc6a9\ub7c9 \ubc0f \uac00\uaca9 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uc120\uc5b8\ud558\uace0, \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub294 \ub9e4 \uc5d0\ud3ec\ud06c\ub9c8\ub2e4 \uc774\ub4e4\uc744 \uc784\uc2dc \uccb4\uc778\uc73c\ub85c \uadf8\ub8f9\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uccb4\uc778 \ub808\ubca8 \uccad\uc0b0 \uac00\uaca9\uc744 \uc124\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubaa9\ud45c\ub294 \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158, \uc6b4\uc601\uc790 \ubc0f \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc815\uaddc\ud654\ub41c \ud6a8\uc6a9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4 \uac00\uc911 \uc870\ud569\uc744 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ubaa8\ub4c8\ud654\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc5b4 \uae30\ub2a5 \uc801\ud569\uc131, \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158 \uc720\ud615\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131 \ubc0f \uc5d0\ud3ec\ud06c \uac04\uc758 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \uc218\uc6a9\ud558\uba70 \uc624\ud504\uccb4\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uace0 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc628\uccb4\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uacf5\uc815\uc131 \ubc0f \uc778\uc13c\ud2f0\ube0c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0, \ucc98\ub9ac\ub7c9, \ud0c8\uc911\uc559\ud654, \uc6b4\uc601\uc790 \uc218\uc775 \ubc0f \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uc548\uc815\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\ucda9 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uac15\uc870\ud558\ub294 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

However, DP is typically applicable only if data have a bounded underlying distribution. We address this limitation by leveraging second-moment information from a small amount of public data. We propose Public-moment-guided Truncation (PMT), which transforms private data using the public second-moment matrix and applies a principled truncation whose radius depends only on non-private quantities: data dimension and sample size. This transformation yields a well-conditioned second-moment matrix, enabling its inversion with a significantly strengthened ability to resist the DP noise. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of PMT by using penalized and generalized linear regressions. Specifically, we design new loss functions and algorithms, ensuring that solutions in the transformed space can be mapped back to the original domain. We have established improvements in the models' DP estimation through theoretical error bounds, robustness guarantees, and convergence results, attributing the gains to the conditioning effect of PMT. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets confirm that PMT substantially improves the accuracy and stability of DP models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ucc28\ubcc4\uc801 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc(DP)\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uacf5\uacf5 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ub450 \ubc88\uc9f8 \ubaa8\uba58\ud2b8 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c PMT\ub77c\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AI \uc2dc\ub300\uc5d0 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud558\uba70, \ucc28\ubcc4\uc801 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc(DP)\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ud574\uacb0\ucc45 \uc911 \ud558\ub098\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 DP\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \uac00\uc9c8 \ub54c\ub9cc \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uacf5\uacf5 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \ub450 \ubc88\uc9f8 \ubaa8\uba58\ud2b8 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uac1c\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub294 Public-moment-guided Truncation (PMT) \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ube44\uacf5\uc2dd\uc801 \uc591\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ucc28\uc6d0\uacfc \uc0d8\ud50c \ud06c\uae30\uc5d0\ub9cc \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294 \uc6d0\uce59\uc801\uc778 \uc808\ub2e8\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ubcc0\ud658\ub41c \ub450 \ubc88\uc9f8 \ubaa8\uba58\ud2b8 \ud589\ub82c\uc740 \uc798 \uc815\uaddc\ud654\ub41c \ud615\ud0dc\ub97c \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc5b4 DP \ub178\uc774\uc988\uc5d0 \uc800\ud56d\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \ud06c\uac8c \uac15\ud654\ub418\uace0, \uc774\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 DP \ucd94\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uac1c\uc120\uc774 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc84c\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "PMT\ub294 \ud569\uc131 \ubc0f \uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c DP \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uacfc \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ub370 \uae30\uc5ec\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc\ub294 AI \uc2dc\ub300\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud558\uba70, \ucc28\ubcc4\uc801 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc(DP)\ub294 \uadf8 \uc911 \ud558\ub098\uc758 \uc88b\uc740 \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 DP\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uae30\ubc18 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \uac00\uc9c8 \ub54c\ub9cc \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc801\uc6a9\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc18c\ub7c9\uc758 \uacf5\uacf5 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ub450 \ubc88\uc9f8 \ubaa8\uba58\ud2b8 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uacf5\uacf5 \ub450 \ubc88\uc9f8 \ubaa8\uba58\ud2b8 \ud589\ub82c\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac1c\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub294 Public-moment-guided Truncation(PMT)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \ube44\uacf5\uc2dd \uc591\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ucc28\uc6d0\uacfc \uc0d8\ud50c \ud06c\uae30\uc5d0\ub9cc \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294 \uc6d0\uce59\uc801\uc778 \uc808\ub2e8\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubcc0\ud658\uc740 \uc798 \uc815\uaddc\ud654\ub41c \ub450 \ubc88\uc9f8 \ubaa8\uba58\ud2b8 \ud589\ub82c\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc5ec DP \ub178\uc774\uc988\uc5d0 \uc800\ud56d\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud604\uc800\ud788 \uac15\ud654\ud55c \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0\uc11c \uadf8 \ubc18\uc804\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud398\ub110\ud2f0\uc640 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uc120\ud615 \ud68c\uadc0\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec PMT\uc758 \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubcc0\ud658\ub41c \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc774 \uc6d0\ub798 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\uc2dc \ub9e4\ud551\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc190\uc2e4 \ud568\uc218\uc640 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\ub4dd\uc744 PMT\uc758 \uc870\ud654 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc5d0 \uae30\uc778\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc624\ucc28 \uacbd\uacc4, \uac15\uac74\uc131 \ubcf4\uc7a5 \ubc0f \uc218\ub834 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 DP \ucd94\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ud655\ub9bd\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud569\uc131 \ubc0f \uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 PMT\uac00 DP \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uacfc \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac1c\uc120\ud568\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

We show that this workflow gives rise to implicit prompt injection: adversarial instructions embedded in automatically generated URL previews, including titles, metadata, and snippets, can introduce a system-level risk that we refer to as silent egress. Using a fully local and reproducible testbed, we demonstrate that a malicious web page can induce an agent to issue outbound requests that exfiltrate sensitive runtime context, even when the final response shown to the user appears harmless. In 480 experimental runs with a qwen2.5:7b-based agent, the attack succeeds with high probability (P (egress) =0.89), and 95% of successful attacks are not detected by output-based safety checks. We also introduce sharded exfiltration, where sensitive information is split across multiple requests to avoid detection. This strategy reduces single-request leakage metrics by 73% (Leak@1) and bypasses simple data loss prevention mechanisms. Our ablation results indicate that defenses applied at the prompt layer offer limited protection, while controls at the system and network layers, such as domain allowlisting and redirect-chain analysis, are considerably more effective. These findings suggest that network egress should be treated as a first-class security outcome in agentic LLM systems.

We present an empirical security analysis of three architectures (cloud-hosted, edge-local swarm, and hybrid) using a multi-device home-automation testbed with local MQTT messaging and an Android smartphone as an edge inference node. We identify five systems-level attack surfaces, including two emergent failures observed during live testbed operation: coordination-state divergence and induced trust erosion. We frame core security properties as measurable systems metrics: data egress volume, failover window exposure, sovereignty boundary integrity, and provenance chain completeness. Our measurements show that edge-local deployments eliminate routine cloud data exposure but silently degrade sovereignty when fallback mechanisms trigger, with boundary crossings invisible at the application layer. Provenance chains remain complete under cooperative operation yet are trivially bypassed without cryptographic enforcement. Failover windows create transient blind spots exploitable for unauthorised actuation. These results demonstrate that deployment architecture, not just model or prompt design, is a primary determinant of security risk in agent-controlled IoT systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774

Existing methods resolve at most two of these tensions simultaneously: greedy heuristics and multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods achieve Day-1 quality but cause catastrophic burnout, while bandit algorithms eliminate burnout only through operationally infeasible 100% workforce utilisation.To address this, we introduce FORGE, a physics-grounded $K+1$ multi-agent simulator in which each contractor is a rational agent that declares its own load-acceptance threshold based on its fatigue state, converting the standard passive Restless Multi-Armed Bandit (RMAB) into a genuine Stackelberg game. Operating within FORGE, we propose a Neural-Linear UCB allocator that fuses a Two-Tower embedding network with a Physics-Informed Covariance Prior derived from offline simulator interactions. The prior simultaneously warm-starts skill-cluster geometry and UCB exploration landscape, providing a geometry-aware belief state from episode 1 that measurably reduces cold-start regret.Over $T = 200$ cold-start episodes, the proposed method achieves the highest reward of all non-oracle methods ($\\text{LRew} = 0.555 \\pm 0.041$) at only 7.6% workforce utilisation--a combination no conventional baseline achieves--while maintaining robustness to workforce turnover up to 50% and observation noise up to $\u03c3= 0.20$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud06c\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc\uc18c\uc2f1 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \uae34\uc7a5 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c FORGE\ub77c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud06c\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc\uc18c\uc2f1 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc740 \ud560\ub2f9 \ud488\uc9c8, \uc778\ub825 \uc9c0\uc18d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131, \uc6b4\uc601 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \ubc0f \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \uacc4\uc57d\uc790 \ud589\ub3d9 \uac04\uc5d0 \uae34\uc7a5 \uad00\uacc4\uac00 \uc874\uc7ac\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "FORGE\ub77c\ub294 \ubb3c\ub9ac\ud559 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uac01 \uacc4\uc57d\uc790\ub294 \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \ud53c\ub85c \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ubd80\ud558 \uc218\uc6a9 \uc784\uacc4\uac12\uc744 \uc120\uc5b8\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 Restless Multi-Armed Bandit(RMAB)\ub97c Stackelberg \uac8c\uc784\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.

AI agents, by contrast, operate on prompts and natural language instructions with no formal behavioral specification. This gap is the root cause of drift, governance failures, and frequent project failures in agentic AI deployments. We introduce Agent Behavioral Contracts (ABC), a formal framework that brings Design-by-Contract principles to autonomous AI agents. An ABC contract C = (P, I, G, R) specifies Preconditions, Invariants, Governance policies, and Recovery mechanisms as first-class, runtime-enforceable components. We define (p, delta, k)-satisfaction -- a probabilistic notion of contract compliance that accounts for LLM non-determinism and recovery -- and prove a Drift Bounds Theorem showing that contracts with recovery rate gamma > alpha (the natural drift rate) bound behavioral drift to D* = alpha/gamma in expectation, with Gaussian concentration in the stochastic setting. We establish sufficient conditions for safe contract composition in multi-agent chains and derive probabilistic degradation bounds. We implement ABC in AgentAssert, a runtime enforcement library, and evaluate on AgentContract-Bench, a benchmark of 200 scenarios across 7 models from 6 vendors. Results across 1,980 sessions show that contracted agents detect 5.2-6.8 soft violations per session that uncontracted baselines miss entirely (p < 0.0001, Cohen's d = 6.7-33.8), achieve 88-100% hard constraint compliance, and bound behavioral drift to D* < 0.27 across extended sessions, with 100% recovery for frontier models and 17-100% across all models, at overhead < 10 ms per action.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc790\uc728 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub514\uc790\uc778-\ubc14\uc774-\uacc4\uc57d \uc6d0\uce59\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud55c Agent Behavioral Contracts(ABC) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uacf5\uc2dd\uc801\uc778 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc0ac\uc591 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uc9c0\uc2dc\ubb38\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\uc5ec \ub4dc\ub9ac\ud504\ud2b8\uc640 \ud504\ub85c\uc81d\ud2b8 \uc2e4\ud328\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "ABC \uacc4\uc57d\uc740 \uc804\uc81c \uc870\uac74, \ubd88\ubcc0 \uc870\uac74, \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4 \uc815\ucc45, \ubcf5\uad6c \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uc5ec \ud589\uc704 \uacc4\uc57d\uc744 \uba85\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uacc4\uc57d\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ube44\uacc4\uc57d \uae30\ubc18\uc120\uc774 \uc644\uc804\ud788 \ub193\uce58\ub294 5.2-6.8\ud68c\uc758 \ubd80\ub4dc\ub7ec\uc6b4 \uc704\ubc18\uc744 \uac10\uc9c0\ud558\uace0, 88-100%\uc758 \uacbd\uc9c1 \uc81c\uc57d \uc900\uc218\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, \ud589\ub3d9 \ub4dc\ub9ac\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c D* < 0.27\ub85c \uc81c\ud55c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "AgentAssert \ub77c\uc774\ube0c\ub7ec\ub9ac \uad6c\ud604\uacfc AgentContract-Bench \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4\ub294 \uc62c\ubc14\ub978 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc9c0\uc815\ud558\uace0 \uc2dc\ud589\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uacc4\uc57d(API, \ud0c0\uc785 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c, \ub2e8\uc5b8 \ub4f1)\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubc18\uba74 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uacf5\uc2dd \ud589\ub3d9 \uc0ac\uc591 \uc5c6\uc774 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\uc640 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uc9c0\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc791\ub3d9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uaca9\ucc28\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI \ubc30\uce58\uc5d0\uc11c \ub4dc\ub9ac\ud504\ud2b8, \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4 \uc2e4\ud328 \ubc0f \ube48\ubc88\ud55c \ud504\ub85c\uc81d\ud2b8 \uc2e4\ud328\uc758 \uadfc\ubcf8 \uc6d0\uc778\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc790\uc728 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub514\uc790\uc778-\ubc14\uc774-\uacc4\uc57d \uc6d0\uce59\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\ub294 \uacf5\uc2dd \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud589\ub3d9 \uacc4\uc57d(ABC)\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Under review", "summary": "Large language model (LLM) agents increasingly rely on external tools and retrieval systems to autonomously complete complex tasks. However, this design exposes agents to indirect prompt injection (IPI), where attacker-controlled context embedded in tool outputs or retrieved content silently steers agent actions away from user intent. Unlike prompt-based attacks, IPI unfolds over multi-turn trajectories, making malicious control difficult to disentangle from legitimate task execution. Existing inference-time defenses primarily rely on heuristic detection and conservative blocking of high-risk actions, which can prematurely terminate workflows or broadly suppress tool usage under ambiguous multi-turn scenarios. We propose AgentSentry, a novel inference-time detection and mitigation framework for tool-augmented LLM agents. To the best of our knowledge, AgentSentry is the first inference-time defense to model multi-turn IPI as a temporal causal takeover. It localizes takeover points via controlled counterfactual re-executions at tool-return boundaries and enables safe continuation through causally guided context purification that removes attack-induced deviations while preserving task-relevant evidence. We evaluate AgentSentry on the \\textsc{AgentDojo} benchmark across four task suites, three IPI attack families, and multiple black-box LLMs. AgentSentry eliminates successful attacks and maintains strong utility under attack, achieving an average Utility Under Attack (UA) of 74.55 %, improving UA by 20.8 to 33.6 percentage points over the strongest baselines without degrading benign

Accepted to the 36th International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS 2026)", "summary": "Value decomposition (VD) methods have achieved remarkable success in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). However, their reliance on the max operator for temporal-difference (TD) target calculation leads to systematic Q-value overestimation. This issue is particularly severe in MARL due to the combinatorial explosion of the joint action space, which often results in unstable learning and suboptimal policies. To address this problem, we propose QSIM, a similarity weighted Q-learning framework that reconstructs the TD target using action similarity. Instead of using the greedy joint action directly, QSIM forms a similarity weighted expectation over a structured near-greedy joint action space. This formulation allows the target to integrate Q-values from diverse yet behaviorally related actions while assigning greater influence to those that are more similar to the greedy choice. By smoothing the target with structurally relevant alternatives, QSIM effectively mitigates overestimation and improves learning stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that QSIM can be seamlessly integrated with various VD methods, consistently yielding superior performance and stability compared to the original algorithms. Furthermore, empirical analysis confirms that QSIM significantly mitigates the systematic value overestimation in MARL.

Despite strong empirical performance, standard flow-matching objectives do not directly control the information geometry of the trajectory, allowing low-entropy bottlenecks that can transiently deplete semantic modes. We propose Entropy-Controlled Flow Matching (ECFM): a constrained variational principle over continuity-equation paths enforcing a global entropy-rate budget d/dt H(mu_t) >= -lambda. ECFM is a convex optimization in Wasserstein space with a KKT/Pontryagin system, and admits a stochastic-control representation equivalent to a Schrodinger bridge with an explicit entropy multiplier. In the pure transport regime, ECFM recovers entropic OT geodesics and Gamma-converges to classical OT as lambda -> 0.

Unlike chatbots that respond to isolated queries, AI agents can now read files, run code, query databases, search the web, and invoke domain-specific skills to execute entire research pipelines autonomously. This paper introduces the concept of vibe researching -- the AI-era parallel to ``vibe coding'' (Karpathy, 2025) -- and uses scholar-skill, a 21-skill plugin for Claude Code covering the full research pipeline from idea to submission, as an illustrative case. I develop a cognitive task framework that classifies research activities along two dimensions -- codifiability and tacit knowledge requirement -- to identify a delegation boundary that is cognitive, not sequential: it cuts through every stage of the research pipeline, not between stages. I argue that AI agents excel at speed, coverage, and methodological scaffolding but struggle with theoretical originality and tacit field knowledge. The paper concludes with an analysis of three implications for the profession -- augmentation with fragile conditions, stratification risk, and a pedagogical crisis -- and proposes five principles for responsible vibe researching.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc740 \uc0ac\ud68c \uacfc\ud559\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc774\uc804 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654 \uae30\uc220\uacfc \uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\ubcc4\ub418\uba70, \uc5f0\uad6c \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2e4\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \uc5f0\uad6c \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud558\uace0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "vibe researching \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uace0, 21\uac00\uc9c0 \uae30\uc220 \ud50c\ub7ec\uadf8\uc778\uc778 scholar-skill\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc804\uccb4 \uc5f0\uad6c \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc18d\ub3c4, \ubc94\uc704, \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc801 \uad6c\uc870\uc5d0\uc11c \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub098\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ub3c5\ucc3d\uc131\uacfc \uc554\ubb35\uc801 \ud604\uc7a5 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\ub294\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc9c1\uc5c5\uc801 \ud568\uc758\uc640 \ucc45\uc784 \uc788\ub294 vibe researching\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub2e4\uc12f \uac00\uc9c0 \uc6d0\uce59\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uc0c1\ud0dc, \ub3c4\uad6c \uc811\uadfc, \uc804\ubb38 \uae30\uc220\uc744 \uac16\ucd98 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ucd94\ub860 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud750\ub984\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc73c\ub85c, \uc0ac\ud68c \uacfc\ud559\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\uc804 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654 \uae30\uc220\uacfc \uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud654\ud55c \ubaa8\uc2b5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \uace0\ub9bd\ub41c \ucffc\ub9ac\uc5d0 \uc751\ub2f5\ud558\ub294 \ucc57\ubd07\uacfc \ub2ec\ub9ac, AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc774\uc81c \ud30c\uc77c\uc744 \uc77d\uace0, \ucf54\ub4dc\ub97c \uc2e4\ud589\ud558\uace0, \ub370\uc774\ud130\ubca0\uc774\uc2a4\ub97c \ucffc\ub9ac\ud558\uba70, \uc6f9\uc744 \uac80\uc0c9\ud558\uace0, \ud2b9\uc815 \ubd84\uc57c\uc758 \uae30\uc220\uc744 \ud638\ucd9c\ud558\uc5ec \uc804\uccb4 \uc5f0\uad6c \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2e4\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \"vibe coding\"(Karpathy, 2025)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c AI \uc2dc\ub300\uc758 \ud3c9\ud589 \uac1c\ub150\uc778 vibe researching\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uace0, \uc544\uc774\ub514\uc5b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\ucd9c\uae4c\uc9c0\uc758 \uc804\uccb4 \uc5f0\uad6c \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8e8\ub294 Claude Code\uc758 21\uac00\uc9c0 \uae30\uc220 \ud50c\ub7ec\uadf8\uc778\uc778 scholar-skill\uc744 \uc0ac\ub840\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub098\ub294 \uc5f0\uad6c \ud65c\ub3d9\uc744 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ucc28\uc6d0(\uad6c\uc18d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uacfc \uc554\ubb35\uc801 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d)\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubd84\ub958\ud558\ub294 \uc778\uc9c0 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc5ec \uc778\uc9c0\uc801 \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0, \uc774 \uacbd\uacc4\ub294 \ub2e8\uacc4 \uac04\uc774 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uc5f0\uad6c \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc758 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc801\uc6a9\ub41c\ub2e4. \ub098\ub294 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc18d\ub3c4, \ubc94\uc704 \ubc0f \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc801 \uad6c\uc870\uc5d0\uc11c \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \ubc18\uba74, \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ub3c5\ucc3d\uc131 \ubc0f \uc554\ubb35\uc801 \ud604\uc7a5 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\ub294\ub2e4\uace0 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc9c1\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud568\uc758(\ucde8\uc57d\ud55c \uc870\uac74\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \uc99d\uac15, \uacc4\uce35\ud654 \uc704\ud5d8, \uad50\uc721\uc801 \uc704\uae30)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubd84\uc11d\uc73c\ub85c \uacb0\ub860\uc744 \ub9fa\uace0 \ucc45\uc784 \uc788\ub294 vibe researching\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub2e4\uc12f \uac00\uc9c0 \uc6d0\uce59\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

Existing solutions either compromise decentralization or suffer from scalability bottlenecks due to linear on-chain costs. To address this, we present SettleFL, a trustless and scalable reward settlement protocol designed to minimize total economic friction by offering a family of two interoperable protocols. Leveraging a shared domain-specific circuit architecture, SettleFL offers two interoperable strategies: (1) a Commit-and-Challenge variant that minimizes on-chain costs via optimistic execution and dispute-driven arbitration, and (2) a Commit-with-Proof variant that guarantees instant finality through per-round validity proofs. This design allows the protocol to flexibly adapt to varying latency and cost constraints while enforcing rational robustness without trusted coordination. We conduct extensive experiments combining real FL workloads and controlled simulations. Results show that SettleFL remains practical when scaling to 800 participants, achieving substantially lower gas cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "SettleFL\uc740 \uc624\ud508 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc559 \uad8c\ud55c \uc5c6\uc774 \uacf5\uc815\ud55c \ud611\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uacbd\uc81c\uc801 \ub9c8\ucc30\uc744 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc5c6\ub294 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc815\uc0b0 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uad8c\ud55c \uc5c6\ub294 \ube14\ub85d\uccb4\uc778\uc758 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub192\uc740 \uc8fc\uae30\uc801\uc778 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud2b9\uc131\uacfc \ucda9\ub3cc\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ud611\ub825\uc758 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ubbc0\ub85c, \ud0c8 \uc911\uc559\ud654 \ubc0f \ud655\uc7a5\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "SettleFL\uc740 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc6b4\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uacf5\uc720 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\ud654 \ud68c\ub85c \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc628\uccb4\uc778 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, SettleFL\uc740 800\uba85\uc758 \ucc38\uac00\uc790\uc5d0\uac8c \ud655\uc7a5\ud560 \ub54c\ub3c4 \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\uba70, \uc5f0\ub8cc\ube44\ub97c \ub300\ud3ed \ub0ae\ucd94\ub294 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "SettleFL\uc740 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \ubc0f \ube44\uc6a9 \uc81c\uc57d\uc5d0 \uc720\uc5f0\ud558\uac8c \uc801\uc751\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud569\ub9ac\uc801\uc778 \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc911\uc559 \uad8c\ud55c\uc774 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \uc624\ud508 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5(FL) \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ud611\ub825\uc758 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \ubd84\uc0b0\ub41c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc815\uc0b0\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uad8c\ud55c \uc5c6\ub294 \ube14\ub85d\uccb4\uc778\uc758 \uc5c4\uccad\ub09c \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uace0\uc8fc\ud30c\uc218 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801 \ud2b9\uc131\uacfc \uc815\uba74\uc73c\ub85c \ucda9\ub3cc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc740 \ud0c8 \uc911\uc559\ud654\ub97c \ud0c0\ud611\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc120\ud615 \uc628\uccb4\uc778 \ube44\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ud655\uc7a5\uc131 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc5d0 \uc2dc\ub2ec\ub9ac\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 SettleFL\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Unlike cloud or desktop settings, mobile devices combine constrained execution contexts, fragmented control interfaces, and rapidly changing application states. As large language models (LLMs) evolve from conversational assistants to action-oriented agents, achieving reliable smartphone-native autonomy requires rethinking how reasoning and control are composed.\n  We introduce ClawMobile as a concrete exploration of this design space. ClawMobile adopts a hierarchical architecture that separates high-level language reasoning from structured, deterministic control pathways, improving execution stability and reproducibility on real devices. Using ClawMobile as a case study, we distill the design principles for mobile LLM runtimes and identify key challenges in efficiency, adaptability, and stability. We argue that building robust smartphone-native agentic systems demands principled coordination between probabilistic planning and deterministic system interfaces.

To address these limitations, we propose BrepCoder, a unifi ed Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that performs diverse CAD tasks from B-rep inputs. By leveraging the code generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we convert CAD modeling sequences into Python-like code and align them with B-rep. We then adopt a two-stage training strategy: First, pre-training on reverse engineering to learn geometric features and design logic. Second, eff ectively extending the model to various downstream tasks such as completion, error correction, and CAD-QA.

This enables low-overhead context assembly and online memory update without expensive LLM training. However, existing solutions remain passive and reactive; memory growth is bounded by information that happens to be available, while memory agents seldom seek external inputs in uncertainties. We propose autonomous memory agents that actively acquire, validate, and curate knowledge at a minimum cost. U-Mem materializes this idea via (i) a cost-aware knowledge-extraction cascade that escalates from cheap self/teacher signals to tool-verified research and, only when needed, expert feedback, and (ii) semantic-aware Thompson sampling to balance exploration and exploitation over memories and mitigate cold-start bias. On both verifiable and non-verifiable benchmarks, U-Mem consistently beats prior memory baselines and can surpass RL-based optimization, improving HotpotQA (Qwen2.5-7B) by 14.6 points and AIME25 (Gemini-2.5-flash) by 7.33 points.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc790\uc728 \uae30\uc5b5 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud55c\uc758 \ube44\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc801\uadf9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud68d\ub4dd\ud558\uace0 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uba70 \uc120\ubcc4\ud558\uc5ec \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc131\uc7a5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc218\ub3d9\uc801\uc774\uba70 \ubc18\uc751\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\uc5ec \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc131\uc7a5\uc5d0 \uc81c\ud55c\uc744 \ub450\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "U-Mem\uc740 \uc800\ube44\uc6a9\uc758 \uc9c0\uc2dd \ucd94\ucd9c \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\uc640 \uc138\uba58\ud2f1 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ubc0f \ud65c\uc6a9 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc790\uc728 \uae30\uc5b5 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uad6c\ud604\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "U-Mem\uc740 \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc640 \ube44\uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\uc804 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uae30\uc900\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\uba70, RL \uae30\ubc18 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "U-Mem\uc740 HotpotQA\uc5d0\uc11c 14.6\uc810, AIME25\uc5d0\uc11c 7.33\uc810\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 LLM\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uc5ec \uacbd\ud5d8\uacfc \ub300\ud654 \uae30\ub85d\uc744 \uc678\ubd80 \uc800\uc7a5\uc18c\ub85c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ube44\uc2fc LLM \ud6c8\ub828 \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 \ub0ae\uc740 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub85c \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \uc870\ub9bd\ud558\uace0 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\ub97c \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc740 \uc218\ub3d9\uc801\uc774\uba70 \ubc18\uc751\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc131\uc7a5\uc740 \uc774\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc81c\ud55c\ub418\uba70, \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc18d\uc5d0\uc11c \uc678\ubd80 \uc785\ub825\uc744 \uac70\uc758 \ucc3e\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud55c\uc758 \ube44\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud68d\ub4dd, \uac80\uc99d \ubc0f \ud050\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud558\ub294 \uc790\uc728 \uae30\uc5b5 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Such capabilities could allow misaligned models to evade oversight mechanisms. Yet principled methods to detect and quantify such behaviours are lacking. Classical definitions of steganography, and detection methods based on them, require a known reference distribution of non-steganographic signals. For the case of steganographic reasoning in LLMs, knowing such a reference distribution is not feasible; this renders these approaches inapplicable. We propose an alternative, \\textbf{decision-theoretic view of steganography}. Our central insight is that steganography creates an asymmetry in usable information between agents who can and cannot decode the hidden content (present within a steganographic signal), and this otherwise latent asymmetry can be inferred from the agents' observable actions. To formalise this perspective, we introduce generalised $\\mathcal{V}$-information: a utilitarian framework for measuring the amount of usable information within some input. We use this to define the \\textbf{steganographic gap} -- a measure that quantifies steganography by comparing the downstream utility of the steganographic signal to agents that can and cannot decode the hidden content. We empirically validate our formalism, and show that it can be used to detect, quantify, and mitigate steganographic reasoning in LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc228\uaca8\uc9c4 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc804\ub2ec\ud558\ub294 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\uae30 \uc2dc\uc791\ud588\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub97c \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubd88\uade0\ud615\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc5ec \uc228\uaca8\uc9c4 \ucf58\ud150\uce20\ub97c \ud574\ub3c5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \uadf8\ub807\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uce21\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc2a4\ud14c\uac00\ub178\uadf8\ub798\ud53c \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uae30 \uc2dc\uc791\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uc774 \uac10\ub3c5 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud68c\ud53c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc774\ub97c \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc6d0\uce59\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc2a4\ud14c\uac00\ub178\uadf8\ub798\ud53c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uad00\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \ud574\ub3c5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \ud574\ub3c5\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4\uc758 \ube44\ub300\uce6d\uc131\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub41c $\textmath{V}$-\uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0, \uc2a4\ud14c\uac00\ub178\uadf8\ub798\ud53d \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \uc815\uc758\ud558\uc5ec \ud65c\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c \ud615\uc2dd\uc744 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc228\uaca8\uc9c4 \ucf58\ud150\uce20\ub97c \ud574\ub3c5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \uadf8\ub807\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \uc720\ud2f8\ub9ac\ud2f0\ub97c \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec \uc2a4\ud14c\uac00\ub178\uadf8\ub798\ud53c\ub97c \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uc788\ub294 \uc2a4\ud14c\uac00\ub178\uadf8\ub798\ud53d \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \uc644\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc774\uc81c \uc2a4\ud14c\uac00\ub178\uadf8\ub798\ud53c \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uae30 \uc2dc\uc791\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uae30\ub2a5\uc740 \uc798\ubabb \ub9de\ucd94\uc5b4\uc9c4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uac10\ub3c5 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud68c\ud53c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc6d0\uce59\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4. \uc2a4\ud14c\uac00\ub178\uadf8\ub798\ud53c\uc758 \uace0\uc804\uc801\uc778 \uc815\uc758\uc640 \uc774\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ube44\uc2a4\ud14c\uac00\ub178\uadf8\ub798\ud53d \uc2e0\ud638\uc758 \uc54c\ub824\uc9c4 \ucc38\uc870 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud55c\ub2e4.

However, most existing RL-based MFD approaches do not fully exploit RL's sequential decision-making strengths, often treating MFD as a simple guessing game (Contextual Bandits). To bridge this gap, we formulate MFD as an offline inverse reinforcement learning problem, where the agent learns the reward dynamics directly from healthy operational sequences, thereby bypassing the need for manual reward engineering and fault labels. Our framework employs Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning to train a discriminator that distinguishes between normal (expert) and policy-generated transitions. The discriminator's learned reward serves as an anomaly score, indicating deviations from normal operating behaviour. When evaluated on three run-to-failure benchmark datasets (HUMS2023, IMS, and XJTU-SY), the model consistently assigns low anomaly scores to normal samples and high scores to faulty ones, enabling early and robust fault detection. By aligning RL's sequential reasoning with MFD's temporal structure, this work opens a path toward RL-based diagnostics in data-driven industrial settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc740 \uae30\uacc4 \uace0\uc7a5 \ud0d0\uc9c0(MFD)\uc5d0 \ud070 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874\uc758 RL \uae30\ubc18 MFD \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 RL\uc758 \uc21c\ucc28\uc801 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uac15\uc810\uc744 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 MFD\ub97c \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uc5ed \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc815\uc758\ud558\uace0, \uac74\uac15\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc9c1\uc811 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ub3d9\ub825\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uc5ec \uc218\ub3d9 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uacf5\ud559\uacfc \uace0\uc7a5 \ub808\uc774\ube14\uc744 \uc6b0\ud68c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc815\uc0c1(\uc804\ubb38\uac00)\uacfc \uc815\ucc45 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc804\ud658\uc744 \uad6c\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \ud310\ubcc4\uae30\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc5ed \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uace0, \ud310\ubcc4\uae30\uac00 \ud559\uc2b5\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc740 \uc815\uc0c1 \ub3d9\uc791 \ud589\ub3d9\uc758 \uc774\ud0c8\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\ub294 \uc774\uc0c1 \uc810\uc218\ub85c \uc791\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uace0\uc7a5\uc73c\ub85c \uac00\ub294 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00\ud588\uc744 \ub54c, \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc815\uc0c1 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc5d0 \ub0ae\uc740 \uc774\uc0c1 \uc810\uc218\ub97c, \uace0\uc7a5 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc5d0 \ub192\uc740 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ud560\ub2f9\ud558\uc5ec \uc870\uae30 \uacac\uace0\ud55c \uace0\uc7a5 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.

While classical epistemic voting results, such as the \\textit{Condorcet Jury Theorem} (CJT), assume fixed participation, real-world aggregation often benefits from allowing agents to say ``I don't know.'' We propose a probabilistic framework where agents engage in a \\textit{calibration} phase, updating beliefs about their own fixed competence, before facing a final confidence gate that determines whether to vote or abstain. We derive a non-asymptotic lower bound on the group's success probability and prove that this \\textit{selective participation} generalizes the asymptotic guarantees of the CJT to a sequential, confidence-gated setting. Empirically, we validate these bounds via Monte Carlo simulations.

Alignment training aims to prevent such behavior by reinforcing the correct goals, but alignment may not always succeed and can lead to unwanted side effects. We propose self-incrimination training, which instead trains agents to produce a visible signal when they covertly misbehave. We train GPT-4.1 and Gemini-2.0 agents to call a report_scheming() tool when behaving deceptively and measure their ability to cause harm undetected in out-of-distribution environments. Self-incrimination significantly reduces the undetected successful attack rate, outperforming matched-capability monitors and alignment baselines while preserving instruction hierarchy and incurring minimal safety tax on general capabilities. Unlike blackbox monitoring, self-incrimination performance is consistent across tasks regardless of how suspicious the misbehavior appears externally. The trained behavior persists under adversarial prompt optimization and generalizes to settings where agents pursue misaligned goals themselves rather than being instructed to misbehave. Our results suggest self-incrimination offers a viable path for reducing frontier misalignment risk, one that neither assumes misbehavior can be prevented nor that it can be reliably classified from the outside.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc790\uae30 \ubc94\uc8c4 \uad50\uc721\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ube44\ubc00\ub9ac\uc5d0 \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud560 \ub54c \uac00\uc2dc\uc801\uc778 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \ubbf8\uac80\ucd9c \uacf5\uaca9\ub960\uc744 \uc904\uc774\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud504\ub860\ud2f0\uc5b4 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc228\uaca8\uc9c4 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ucd94\uad6c\ud558\uba70 \uac10\uc2dc\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uadf8 \ucd94\uad6c\ub97c \uc228\uae38 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8f9\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "GPT-4.1 \ubc0f Gemini-2.0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828\uc2dc\ucf1c \uadf8\ub4e4\uc774 \uae30\ub9cc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud589\ub3d9\ud560 \ub54c report_scheming() \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \ud638\ucd9c\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc790\uae30 \ubc94\uc8c4 \uad50\uc721\uc774 \ubbf8\uac80\ucd9c \uc131\uacf5 \uacf5\uaca9\ub960\uc744 \uc720\uc758\ubbf8\ud558\uac8c \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba70, \uc77c\uce58\ud558\ub294 \uae30\ub2a5\uc758 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130 \ubc0f \uc815\ub82c \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc790\uae30 \ubc94\uc8c4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc740 \uc758\uc2ec\uc2a4\ub7ec\uc6b4 \ud589\ub3d9\uc758 \uc678\ubd80 \ud45c\uc2dd\uacfc \uad00\uacc4\uc5c6\uc774 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ud504\ub860\ud2f0\uc5b4 \ube44\uc815\ub82c \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc904\uc774\ub294 \uc720\ud6a8\ud55c \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud504\ub860\ud2f0\uc5b4 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uac10\uc2dc\ub97c \ud53c\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc228\uaca8\uc9c4 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ucd94\uad6c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc815\ub82c \ud6c8\ub828\uc740 \uc62c\ubc14\ub978 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uac15\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubc29\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud56d\uc0c1 \uc131\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba70 \uc6d0\uce58 \uc54a\ub294 \ubd80\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc790\uae30 \ubc94\uc8c4 \uad50\uc721\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ube44\ubc00\ub9ac\uc5d0 \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud560 \ub54c \uac00\uc2dc\uc801\uc778 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud6c8\ub828\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 GPT-4.1 \ubc0f Gemini-2.0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828\uc2dc\ucf1c \uae30\ub9cc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud589\ub3d9\ud560 \ub54c report_scheming() \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \ud638\ucd9c\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\uace0, \ubd84\ud3ec \ubc16 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uac10\uc9c0\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \ud53c\ud574\ub97c \uc8fc\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uce21\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc790\uae30 \ubc94\uc8c4\ub294 \uac10\uc9c0\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \uc131\uacf5 \uacf5\uaca9\ub960\uc744 \uc720\uc758\ubbf8\ud558\uac8c \uc904\uc774\uba70, \uc77c\uce58\ud558\ub294 \uae30\ub2a5\uc758 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130 \ubc0f \uc815\ub82c \uae30\uc900\uc120\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uc9c0\uc2dc \uacc4\uce35 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \uc77c\ubc18 \ub2a5\ub825\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucd5c\uc18c\ud55c\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc138\ub97c \ubd80\uacfc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\uacfc \ub2ec\ub9ac, \uc790\uae30 \ubc94\uc8c4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc740 \ud589\ub3d9\uc758 \uc678\ubd80\uc801 \uc758\uc2ec\uc744 \ubd88\ubb38\ud558\uace0 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ud589\ub3d9\uc740 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc9c0\uc18d\ub418\uba70, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ucd94\uad6c\ud560 \ub54c\uc5d0\ub3c4 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc790\uae30 \ubc94\uc8c4\uac00 \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \ud589\ub3d9\uc774 \uc608\ubc29\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4\uace0 \uac00\uc815\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uac70\ub098 \uc678\ubd80\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uc788\uac8c \ubd84\ub958\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4\uace0 \uac00\uc815\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \ud504\ub860\ud2f0\uc5b4 \ube44\uc815\ub82c \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc904\uc774\ub294 \uc720\ud6a8\ud55c \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud568\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Recently, agentic generative AI systems have demonstrated significant advances in algorithm design, improving code efficiency, and enabling discovery across scientific domains.\n  Bridging these worlds, we present ArchAgent, an automated computer architecture discovery system built on AlphaEvolve. We show ArchAgent's ability to automatically design/implement state-of-the-art (SoTA) cache replacement policies (architecting new mechanisms/logic, not only changing parameters), broadly within the confines of an established cache replacement policy design competition.\n  In two days without human intervention, ArchAgent generated a policy achieving a 5.3% IPC speedup improvement over the prior SoTA on public multi-core Google Workload Traces. On the heavily-explored single-core SPEC06 workloads, it generated a policy in just 18 days showing a 0.9% IPC speedup improvement over the existing SoTA (a similar \"winning margin\" as reported by the existing SoTA). ArchAgent achieved these gains 3-5x faster than prior human-developed SoTA policies.\n  Agentic flows also enable \"post-silicon hyperspecialization\" where agents tune runtime-configurable parameters exposed in hardware policies to further align the policies with a specific workload (mix). Exploiting this, we demonstrate a 2.4% IPC speedup improvement over prior SoTA on SPEC06 workloads.\n  Finally, we outline broader implications for computer architecture research in the era of agentic AI. For example, we demonstrate the phenomenon of \"simulator escapes\", where the agentic AI flow discovered and exploited a loophole in a popular microarchitectural simulator - a consequence of the fact that these research tools were designed for a (now past) world where they were exclusively operated by humans acting in good-faith.", "AI": {"tldr": "ArchAgent\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ucef4\ud4e8\ud130 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \ubc1c\uacac \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc73c\ub85c, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uce90\uc2dc \uad50\uccb4 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uba70, \uc778\uac04 \uac1c\uc785 \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc218\uc694\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucd94\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubbfc\ucca9\ud55c \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uc124\uacc4 \ud750\ub984\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "ArchAgent\ub294 AlphaEvolve\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uc5ec \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uce90\uc2dc \uad50\uccb4 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc124\uacc4 \ubc0f \uad6c\ud604\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "ArchAgent\ub294 \uacf5\uacf5 \ub2e4\uc911 \ucf54\uc5b4 Google Workload Traces\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\uc804 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ub300\ube44 5.3% IPC \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc73c\uba70, SPEC06 \ub2e8\uc77c \ucf54\uc5b4 \uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c\ub4dc\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \ub9c8\uc9c4\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI \uc2dc\ub300\uc758 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud130 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub113\uc740 \ud568\uc758\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubbfc\ucca9\ud55c \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uc124\uacc4 \ud750\ub984\uc740 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305 \uc218\uc694\ub97c \ucda9\uc871\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ud798\uc758 \ubc30\uc218\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uc0dd\uc131 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \uc124\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \ucf54\ub4dc \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0 \uacfc\ud559 \ubd84\uc57c \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc138\uacc4\ub97c \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\uc5ec, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 ArchAgent\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

As deep networks and large language models continue to scale, their internal behavior becomes increasingly opaque, leading to hallucinations, fragile generalization under distribution shift, and growing computational and energy demands. By analyzing the eigenvalue dynamics of hidden activations across layers and inputs, this work shows that spectral statistics provide a compact, stable, and interpretable lens on model behavior, capable of separating structured, causal representations from noise-dominated variability. Within this framework, the first contribution, EigenTrack, introduces a real-time method for detecting hallucinations and out-of-distribution behavior in large language and vision-language models. EigenTrack transforms streaming activations into spectral descriptors such as entropy, variance, and deviations from the Marchenko-Pastur baseline, and models their temporal evolution using lightweight recurrent classifiers, enabling early detection of reliability failures before they appear in model outputs while offering interpretable insight into representation dynamics. The second contribution, RMT-KD, presents a principled approach to compressing deep networks via random matrix theoretic knowledge distillation. By interpreting outlier eigenvalues in activation spectra as carriers of task-relevant information, RMT-KD progressively projects networks onto lower-dimensional subspaces through iterative self-distillation, yielding significantly more compact and energy-efficient models while preserving accuracy and dense, hardware-friendly structure.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740

However, existing evaluation practices remain outcome-centric, focusing primarily on final task performance. Through a review of prior work, we find that none of the surveyed agentic AutoML systems report structured, decision-level evaluation metrics intended for post-hoc assessment of intermediate decision quality. To address this limitation, we propose an Evaluation Agent (EA) that performs decision-centric assessment of AutoML agents without interfering with their execution. The EA is designed as an observer that evaluates intermediate decisions along four dimensions: decision validity, reasoning consistency, model quality risks beyond accuracy, and counterfactual decision impact. Across four proof-of-concept experiments, we demonstrate that the EA can (i) detect faulty decisions with an F1 score of 0.919, (ii) identify reasoning inconsistencies independent of final outcomes, and (iii) attribute downstream performance changes to agent decisions, revealing impacts ranging from -4.9\\% to +8.3\\% in final metrics. These results illustrate how decision-centric evaluation exposes failure modes that are invisible to outcome-only metrics. Our work reframes the evaluation of agentic AutoML systems from an outcome-based perspective to one that audits agent decisions, offering a foundation for reliable, interpretable, and governable autonomous ML systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 AutoML \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00 \uad00\ud589\uc774 \ucd5c\uc885 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0\ub9cc \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uace0 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc911\uac04 \uacb0\uc815 \ud488\uc9c8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ud3c9\uac00 \uc9c0\ud45c\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud3c9\uac00 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8(EA)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec AutoML \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc911\uac04 \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ubc29\ud574\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Recent studies have attempted to address this limitation through various approaches, among which increasing reflective diversity has shown promise. Our empirical analysis reveals a strong positive correlation between reflective diversity and task success, further motivating the need for diverse reflection signals. We introduce ParamMem, a parametric memory module that encodes cross-sample reflection patterns into model parameters, enabling diverse reflection generation through temperature-controlled sampling. Building on this module, we propose ParamAgent, a reflection-based agent framework that integrates parametric memory with episodic and cross-sample memory. Extensive experiments on code generation, mathematical reasoning, and multi-hop question answering demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines. Further analysis reveals that ParamMem is sample-efficient, enables weak-to-strong transfer across model scales, and supports self-improvement without reliance on stronger external model, highlighting the potential of ParamMem as an effective component for enhancing language agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ubc18\uc0ac\uc801 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubc18\uc131\uc801 \uc790\uae30 \uac80\ud1a0\uac00 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud558\uc5ec \ucd94\ub860 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud568.", "method": "ParamMem\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \uae30\uc5b5 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubc18\uc0ac \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\uc5d0 \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ud558\uace0, \uc628\ub3c4 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubc18\uc0ac\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548.", "result": "\ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131, \uc218\ud559\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \ub2e4\uc911 \ud638\ud551 \uc9c8\ubb38 \uc751\ub2f5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uac1c\uc120\uc774 \uad00\ucc30\ub428.", "conclusion": "ParamMem\uc740 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub85c\uc11c\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70, \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc774 \ub192\uace0 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c \uac04\uc758 \uc57d\ud55c-\uac15\ud55c \uc804\uc774\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud568.", "translated_summary": "\uc790\uae30 \ubc18\uc131\uc740 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc885\uc885 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \ucd94\ub860 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc \uc5f0\uad6c\ub4e4\uc740 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc2dc\ub3c4\ud588\uc73c\uba70, \uadf8 \uc911\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc18\uc0ac\uc801 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uc758 \uc99d\uac00\uac00 \uc720\ub9dd\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \ubd84\uc11d\uc740 \ubc18\uc0ac\uc801 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uacfc \uacfc\uc81c \uc131\uacf5 \uac04\uc758 \uac15\ud55c \uae0d\uc815\uc801 \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b4\uc5b4 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubc18\uc0ac \uc2e0\ud638\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \ub354\uc6b1 \ucd09\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 ParamMem\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\uc5d0 \uad50\ucc28 \uc0d8\ud50c \ubc18\uc0ac \ud328\ud134\uc744 \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ud558\uc5ec \uc628\ub3c4 \uc870\uc808 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubc18\uc0ac\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 ParamAgent\ub77c\ub294 \ubc18\uc0ac \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\uc640 \uc5d0\ud53c\uc18c\ub4dc \ubc0f \uad50\ucc28 \uc0d8\ud50c \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131, \uc218\ud559\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \ub2e4\uc911 \ud638\ud551 \uc9c8\ubb38 \uc751\ub2f5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc740 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uae30\uc900\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd94\uac00 \ubd84\uc11d \uacb0\uacfc ParamMem\uc740 \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uba70 \ubaa8\ub378 \uaddc\ubaa8 \uac04\uc758 \uc57d\ud55c-\uac15\ud55c \uc804\uc774\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uba70, \ub354 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc678\ubd80 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc790\uae30 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub85c\uc11c\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

The lead-field method enables fast ECG simulations while preserving full geometric fidelity. Achieving high anatomical accuracy in torso representation is, however, challenging in clinical practice, as imaging protocols are typically focused on the heart and often do not include the entire torso. In addition, the computational cost of the lead-field method scales linearly with the number of electrodes, limiting its applicability in high-density recording settings. To date, no existing approach simultaneously achieves high anatomical fidelity, low data requirements and computational efficiency. In this work, we propose a shape-informed surrogate model of the lead-field operator that serves as a drop-in replacement for the full-order model in forward ECG simulations. The proposed framework consists of two components: a geometry-encoding module that maps anatomical shapes into a low-dimensional latent space, and a geometry-conditioned neural surrogate that predicts lead-field gradients from spatial coordinates, electrode positions and latent codes. The proposed method achieves high accuracy in approximating lead fields both within the torso (mean angular error 5\u00b0) and inside the heart, resulting in highly accurate ECG simulations (relative mean squared error <2.5%. The surrogate consistently outperforms the widely used pseudo lead-field approximation while preserving negligible inference cost. Owing to its compact latent representation, the method does not require a fully detailed torso segmentation and can therefore be deployed in data-limited settings while preserving high-fidelity ECG simulations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uace0\ud574\uc0c1\ub3c4 \uc804\uae30 \uc0dd\ub9ac\ud559\uc801 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc81c\uc548.", "motivation": "\uc815\ud655\ud55c \uccb4\ud615 \ud45c\ud604\uc774 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\ub098 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc2e4\uc6a9\ud654\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc774 \uc874\uc7ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud615\uc0c1 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uace0\ub824\ud55c \ub300\uccb4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\ubc00\ud55c ECG \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uccb4\ub0b4 \ubc0f \uc2ec\uc7a5 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ub192\uc740 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uace0 \uc0c1\ub300 \ud3c9\uade0 \uc81c\uacf1 \uc624\ucc28\uac00 2.5% \ubbf8\ub9cc\uc774\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc774 \ub192\uace0 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud55c\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc694\uad6c\ub85c \uc0dd\ub9ac\ud559\uc801 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud604\ub300\uc758 \uc804\uae30\uc2ec\uc804\ub3c4(ECG) \uacc4\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ubcf5\ubd80 \uc601\uc5ed\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ud45c\ud604\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9ac\ub4dc \ud544\ub4dc \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc804\uccb4 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \ucda9\uc2e4\ub3c4\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ube60\ub978 ECG \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uccb4\ud615 \ud45c\ud604\uc5d0\uc11c \ub192\uc740 \ud574\ubd80\ud559\uc801 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc784\uc0c1 \uc2e4\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc774\uba70, \uc774\ubbf8\uc9d5 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2ec\uc7a5\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uace0 \uc804\uccb4 \uccb4\ud615\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \ub9ac\ub4dc \ud544\ub4dc \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc740 \uc804\uadf9 \uc218\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc120\ud615\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uc5ec \uace0\ubc00\ub3c4 \ub179\ucde8 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud604\uc7ac\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ub192\uc740 \ud574\ubd80\ud559\uc801 \ucda9\uc2e4\ub3c4, \ub0ae\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d \ubc0f \uacc4\uc0b0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc804\uba74 ECG \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c \uc804\uccb4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ub300\uccb4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub9ac\ub4dc \ud544\ub4dc \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc790\uc758 \ud615\uc0c1 \uc815\ubcf4 \uae30\ubc18 \ub300\uccb4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc548\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4: \ud574\ubd80\ud559\uc801 \ud615\ud0dc\ub97c \uc800\ucc28\uc6d0 \uc7a0\uc7ac \uacf5\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \ub9e4\ud551\ud558\ub294 \uae30\ud558\ud559 \uc778\ucf54\ub529 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uacfc \uacf5\uac04 \uc88c\ud45c, \uc804\uadf9 \uc704\uce58 \ubc0f \uc7a0\uc7ac \ucf54\ub4dc\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ub9ac\ub4dc \ud544\ub4dc \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8\ub97c \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \uae30\ud558\ud559 \uc870\uac74 \uc2e0\uacbd \ub300\uccb4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc548\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uccb4\ub0b4 \ubc0f \uc2ec\uc7a5 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ub9ac\ub4dc \ud544\ub4dc\ub97c \uadfc\uc0ac\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\uc5b4 \ub192\uc740 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70(\ud3c9\uade0 \uac01 \uc624\ucc28 5\u00b0), \uc0c1\ub300 \ud3c9\uade0 \uc81c\uacf1 \uc624\ucc28\ub294 2.5% \ubbf8\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc815\ud655\ud55c ECG \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub300\uccb4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \uc758\uc0ac \ub9ac\ub4dc \ud544\ub4dc \uadfc\uc0ac\ub97c \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ub2a5\uac00\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uac70\uc758 \uc5c6\ub294 \ucd94\ub860 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Existing approaches use supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to train action scorers, but SFT treats each candidate independently and does not explicitly teach the model to discriminate between actions that are physically correct and those that are subtly wrong. We propose the Contrastive World Model (CWM), which fine-tunes a large language model (LLM) as an action scorer using an InfoNCE contrastive objective with hard-mined negative examples. The key idea is to push valid actions away from invalid ones in scoring space, with special emphasis on hard negatives: semantically similar but physically incompatible candidates. We evaluate CWM on the ScienceWorld benchmark through two studies. First, an intrinsic affordance evaluation on 605 hard-negative test pairs shows that CWM outperforms SFT by +6.76 percentage points on Precision@1 for minimal-edit negatives -- cases where a single word changes the physical outcome -- and achieves a higher AUC-ROC (0.929 vs. 0.906). Second, a live filter characterisation study measures how well CWM ranks gold-path actions against all valid environment actions during task execution. Under out-of-distribution stress conditions, CWM maintains a significantly better safety margin (-2.39) than SFT (-3.96), indicating that the gold action is ranked closer to the top. These results support the hypothesis that contrastive training induces representations that capture physical feasibility more faithfully than SFT alone.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8

Despite their success, modern deep forecasting models are typically trained to minimize point-wise prediction loss without leveraging the rich information contained in past prediction residuals from rolling forecasts - residuals that reflect persistent biases, unmodeled patterns, or evolving dynamics. We propose TEFL (Temporal Error Feedback Learning), a unified learning framework that explicitly incorporates these historical residuals into the forecasting pipeline during both training and evaluation. To make this practical in deep multi-step settings, we address three key challenges: (1) selecting observable multi-step residuals under the partial observability of rolling forecasts, (2) integrating them through a lightweight low-rank adapter to preserve efficiency and prevent overfitting, and (3) designing a two-stage training procedure that jointly optimizes the base forecaster and error module. Extensive experiments across 10 real-world datasets and 5 backbone architectures show that TEFL consistently improves accuracy, reducing MAE by 5-10% on average.

Despite its relevance, the community lacks a systematic understanding of coding agent performance on this task. Agent optimization differs fundamentally from conventional software engineering: the target agent interleaves deterministic code with stochastic LLM completions, requiring structured capture of both intermediate reasoning and downstream execution outcomes. To address these challenges, we introduce VERO (Versioning, Rewards, and Observations), which provides (1) a reproducible evaluation harness with versioned agent snapshots, budget-controlled evaluation, and structured execution traces, and (2) a benchmark suite of target agents and tasks with reference evaluation procedures. Using VERO, we conduct an empirical study comparing optimizer configurations across tasks and analyzing which modifications reliably improve target agent performance.

However, existing NMF-based methods are inherently single-scale and fail to capture the evolution of connectivity structures across resolutions. In this work, we propose persistent nonnegative matrix factorization (pNMF), a scale-parameterized family of NMF problems, that produces a sequence of persistence-aligned embeddings rather than a single one. By leveraging persistent homology, we identify a canonical minimal sufficient scale set at which the underlying connectivity undergoes qualitative changes. These canonical scales induce a sequence of graph Laplacians, leading to a coupled NMF formulation with scale-wise geometric regularization and explicit cross-scale consistency constraint. We analyze the structural properties of the embeddings along the scale parameter and establish bounds on their increments between consecutive scales.

Despite this rapid development, comprehensive and broad synthesis of AI-LCA research remains limited. To address this gap, this study presents a detailed review of published work at the intersection of AI and LCA, leveraging large language models (LLMs) to identify current trends, emerging themes, and future directions. Our analyses reveal that as LCA research continues to expand, the adoption of AI technologies has grown dramatically, with a noticeable shift toward LLM-driven approaches, continued increases in ML applications, and statistically significant correlations between AI approaches and corresponding LCA stages. By integrating LLM-based text-mining methods with traditional literature review techniques, this study introduces a dynamic and effective framework capable of capturing both high-level research trends and nuanced conceptual patterns (themes) across the field. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the potential of LLM-assisted methodologies to support large-scale, reproducible reviews across broad research domains, while also evaluating pathways for computationally-efficient LCA in the context of rapidly developing AI technologies. In doing so, this work helps LCA practitioners incorporate state-of-the-art tools and timely insights into environmental assessments that can enhance the rigor and quality of sustainability-driven decisions and decision-making processes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5(AI)\uc640 \uc0dd\uc560 \uc8fc\uae30 \ud3c9\uac00(LCA)\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\uac00 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 AI-LCA \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \uacbd\ud5a5\uacfc \ubbf8\ub798 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0 LLM\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ub9ac\ubdf0 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AI \uae30\uc220\uc758 \ucc44\ud0dd \uc99d\uac00\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 AI-LCA \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc885\ud569\uc801\uc778 \uac80\ud1a0\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "LLM \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ub9c8\uc774\ub2dd \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ubb38\ud5cc \uac80\ud1a0 \uae30\uc220\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec AI\uc640 LCA\uc758 \uad50\ucc28\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd9c\ud310\ub41c \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "LCA \uc5f0\uad6c\uac00 \ud655\uc7a5\ub428\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c AI \uae30\uc220\uc758 \ucc44\ud0dd\uc774 \uae09\uaca9\ud788 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \uc804\ud658\uc774 \ub69c\ub837\ud558\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "LLM \ubcf4\uc870 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc774 LCA \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8\uc758 \uc7ac\ud604 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub9ac\ubdf0\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc \uba87 \ub144 \ub3d9\uc548 \uc0dd\uc560 \uc8fc\uae30 \ud3c9\uac00(LCA)\uc5d0 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5(AI)\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uc5f0\uad6c\uac00 \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ub9ce\uc740 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub4e4\uc774 LCA\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uae09\uc18d\ud55c \ubc1c\uc804\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 AI-LCA \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc885\ud569\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc885\ud569\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uc18c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 AI\uc640 LCA\uc758 \uad50\ucc28\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\ud45c\ub41c \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc790\uc138\ud55c \uac80\ud1a0\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uacbd\ud5a5, \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc8fc\uc81c \ubc0f \ud5a5\ud6c4 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0 \ub530\ub974\uba74, LCA \uc5f0\uad6c\uac00 \uacc4\uc18d \ud655\uc7a5\ub428\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c AI \uae30\uc220\uc758 \ucc44\ud0dd\uc774 \uae09\uaca9\ud788 \uc99d\uac00\ud588\uc73c\uba70, LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \ub208\uc5d0 \ub744\ub294 \uc804\ud658, ML \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc758 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uc99d\uac00, AI \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uacfc \ud574\ub2f9 LCA \ub2e8\uacc4 \uac04\uc758 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\uc758\ubbf8\ud55c \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4\uac00 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ubb38\ud5cc \uac80\ud1a0 \uae30\uc220\uacfc LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ub9c8\uc774\ub2dd \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368, \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \ub192\uc740 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uacbd\ud5a5\uacfc \uc138\ubd80\uc801\uc778 \uac1c\ub150 \ud328\ud134(\uc8fc\uc81c)\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc5ed\ub3d9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc1c\uacac\ub4e4\uc740 LLM \ubcf4\uc870 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc774 \ube60\ub974\uac8c \ubc1c\uc804\ud558\ub294 AI \uae30\uc220\uc758 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0\uc11c \uacc4\uc0b0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 LCA \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ub113\uc740 \uc5f0\uad6c \uc601\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8\uc758 \uc7ac\ud604 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub9ac\ubdf0\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub807\uac8c \ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368, \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 LCA \uc2e4\ubb34\uc790\ub4e4\uc774 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815\uc758 rigor\uc640 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ucd5c\uc2e0 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc640 \uc2dc\uc758\uc801\uc808\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc744 \uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

We investigate whether this gap can be closed by integrating an instruction-tuned model (ITM) into an LRM. Analyzing their differences in parameter space, namely task vectors, we find that their principal subspaces are nearly orthogonal across key modules, suggesting a lightweight merging with minimal interference. However, we also demonstrate that naive merges are fragile because they overlook the output format mismatch between LRMs (with explicit thinking and response segments) and ITMs (answers-only). We introduce RAIN-Merging (Reasoning-Aware Instruction-attention guided Null-space projection Merging), a gradient-free method that integrates instruction following while preserving thinking format and reasoning performance. First, with a small reasoning calibration set, we project the ITM task vector onto the null space of forward features at thinking special tokens, which preserves the LRM's structured reasoning mechanisms. Second, using a small instruction calibration set, we estimate instruction attention to derive module-specific scaling that amplifies instruction-relevant components and suppresses leakage. Across four instruction-following benchmarks and nine reasoning & general capability benchmarks, RAIN-Merging substantially improves instruction adherence while maintaining reasoning quality. The gains are consistent across model scales and architectures, translating to improved performance in agent settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \ucd94\ub860

Through systematic analysis, we observe that these failures frequently stem not from a lack of reasoning capacity, but from a deficiency in self-regulatory control, where valid logic is destabilized by uncontrolled exploration or the failure to recognize logical sufficiency. Motivated by this observation, we propose Metacognitive Behavioral Tuning (MBT), a post-training framework that explicitly injects metacognitive behaviors into the model's thought process. MBT implements this via two complementary formulations: (1) MBT-S, which synthesizes rigorous reasoning traces from scratch, and (2) MBT-R, which rewrites the student's initial traces to stabilize intrinsic exploration patterns. Experiments across multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that MBT consistently outperforms baselines, achieving notable gains on challenging benchmarks. By effectively eliminating reasoning collapse, MBT achieves higher accuracy with significantly reduced token consumption, demonstrating that internalizing metacognitive strategies leads to more stable and robust reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub378(LRMs)\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uba54\ud0c0\uc778\uc9c0 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc870\uc815(MBT) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LRMs\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc62c\ubc14\ub978 \ub2f5\ubcc0\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc790\uac00 \uc870\uc808 \ud1b5\uc81c\uc758 \ubd80\uc871\uc5d0\uc11c \ube44\ub86f\ub41c \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uba54\ud0c0\uc778\uc9c0 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc870\uc815(MBT)\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc0ac\uace0 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0 \uba54\ud0c0\uc778\uc9c0 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc8fc\uc785\ud558\ub294 \ud6c4\uc18d \ud6c8\ub828 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Relational Deep Learning (RDL) methods automate feature engineering via message passing, while classical approaches like Deep Feature Synthesis (DFS) rely on predefined non-parametric aggregators. Despite performance gains, the comparative advantages of RDL over DFS and the design principles for selecting effective architectures remain poorly understood. We present a comprehensive study that unifies RDL and DFS in a shared design space and conducts architecture-centric searches across diverse RDB tasks. Our analysis yields three key findings: (1) RDL does not consistently outperform DFS, with performance being highly task-dependent; (2) no single architecture dominates across tasks, underscoring the need for task-aware model selection; and (3) validation accuracy is an unreliable guide for architecture choice. This search yields a model performance bank that links architecture configurations to their performance; leveraging this bank, we analyze the drivers of the RDL-DFS performance gap and introduce two task signals -- RDB task homophily and an affinity embedding that captures size, path, feature, and temporal structure -- whose correlation with the gap enables principled routing. Guided by these signals, we propose Relatron, a task embedding-based meta-selector that chooses between RDL and DFS and prunes the within-family search. Lightweight loss-landscape metrics further guard against brittle checkpoints by preferring flatter optima. In experiments, Relatron resolves the \"more tuning, worse performance\" effect and, in joint hyperparameter-architecture optimization, achieves up to 18.5% improvement over strong baselines with 10x lower cost than Fisher information-based alternatives.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uad00\uacc4\ud615 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ubca0\uc774\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc608\uce21 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\ub85c, \uad00\uacc4\ud615 \ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd(RDL)\uacfc \ub525 \ud53c\ucc98 \uc2e0\uc11c\uc2dc\uc2a4(DFS)\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c RDB \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \uc911\uc2ec \uac80\uc0c9\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc5ec \uc131\ub2a5 \ubc0f \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \uc120\ud0dd\uc758 \uc6d0\uce59\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uad00\uacc4\ud615 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ubca0\uc774\uc2a4(RDB)\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc608\uce21 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc740 \ud06c\ub85c\uc2a4 \ud14c\uc774\ube14 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uacfc \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud2b9\uc9d5 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc5b4 \ud574\uacb0\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\uad00\uacc4\ud615 \ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd(RDL)\uacfc \ub525 \ud53c\ucc98 \uc2e0\uc11c\uc2dc\uc2a4(DFS)\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uacf5\uc720 \ub514\uc790\uc778 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \uac80\uc0c9\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "RDL\uc740 DFS\ub97c \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ub2a5\uac00\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba70, \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \uc120\ud0dd\uc740 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ub2ec\ub77c\uc9c0\uace0, \uac80\uc99d \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uac00 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \uc120\ud0dd\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc9c0\ud45c\uc784\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Relatron\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uba54\ud0c0 \uc120\ud0dd\uae30\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec RDL\uacfc DFS \uac04\uc758 \uc120\ud0dd\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uace0, \ub0b4\ubd80 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uba70, \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uae30\uc900\uc120 \ub300\ube44 \ucd5c\ub300 18.5% \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uad00\uacc4\ud615 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ubca0\uc774\uc2a4(RDB)\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc608\uce21 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc740 \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc744 \uad6c\ub3d9\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud06c\ub85c\uc2a4 \ud14c\uc774\ube14 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uacfc \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud2b9\uc9d5 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc774 \ub0a8\uc544\uc788\ub2e4. \uad00\uacc4\ud615 \ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd(RDL) \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0 \uc804\uc1a1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud2b9\uc9d5 \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\ub9c1\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub525 \ud53c\ucc98 \uc2e0\uc11c\uc2dc\uc2a4(DFS)\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uc0ac\uc804 \uc815\uc758\ub41c \ube44\ubaa8\uc218 \uc9d1\uacc4\uae30\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0, RDL\uc774 DFS\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uac00\uc9c0\ub294 \ube44\uad50 \uc6b0\uc704\uc640 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \uc120\ud0dd\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc124\uacc4 \uc6d0\uce59\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc798 \uc774\ud574\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 RDL\uacfc DFS\ub97c \uacf5\uc720 \ub514\uc790\uc778 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uace0 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c RDB \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \uc911\uc2ec \uac80\uc0c9\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubd84\uc11d\uc740 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \uc774\ub048\ub2e4: (1) RDL\uc740 DFS\ub97c \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ub2a5\uac00\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba70, \uc131\ub2a5\uc740 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ud06c\uac8c \ub2ec\ub77c\uc9c4\ub2e4;

Current AI systems process vast information to produce sophisticated predictions, yet predictions can appear successful while the underlying interaction with the environment degrades. What is missing is a principled measure of how much of the total information a system deploys is actually shared between its observations, actions, and outcomes. We prove this shared fraction, which we term bipredictability, P, is intrinsic to any interaction, derivable from first principles, and strictly bounded: P can reach unity in quantum systems, P equal to, or smaller than 0.5 in classical systems, and lower once agency (action selection) is introduced. We confirm these bounds in a physical system (double pendulum), reinforcement learning agents, and multi turn LLM conversations. These results distinguish agency from intelligence: agency is the capacity to act on predictions, whereas intelligence additionally requires learning from interaction, self-monitoring of its learning effectiveness, and adapting the scope of observations, actions, and outcomes to restore effective learning. By this definition, current AI systems achieve agency but not intelligence. Inspired by thalamocortical regulation in biological systems, we demonstrate a feedback architecture that monitors P in real time, establishing a prerequisite for adaptive, resilient AI.", "AI":

The distributional properties of IRs can leak training-set membership signals, enabling Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) whose strength varies across layers. Although Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) mitigates such leakage, existing implementations employ per-example gradient clipping and a uniform, layer-agnostic noise multiplier, ignoring heterogeneous layer-wise MIA vulnerability. This paper introduces Layer-wise MIA-risk-aware DP-SGD (LM-DP-SGD), which adaptively allocates privacy protection across layers in proportion to their MIA risk. Specifically, LM-DP-SGD trains a shadow model on a public shadow dataset, extracts per-layer IRs from its train/test splits, and fits layer-specific MIA adversaries, using their attack error rates as MIA-risk estimates. Leveraging the cross-dataset transferability of MIAs, these estimates are then used to reweight each layer's contribution to the globally clipped gradient during private training, providing layer-appropriate protection under a fixed noise magnitude. We further establish theoretical guarantees on both privacy and convergence of LM-DP-SGD. Extensive experiments show that, under the same privacy budget, LM-DP-SGD reduces the peak IR-level MIA risk while preserving utility, yielding a superior privacy-utility trade-off.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 Layer-wise MIA-risk-aware DP-SGD (LM-DP-SGD)\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \ucc28\ubcc4\uc801 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \ub808\uc774\uc5b4 \ubcc4 MIA \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud558\uc5ec \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc \ubcf4\ud638\ub97c \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud560\ub2f9\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "Embedding-as-an-Interface (EaaI) \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c, Intermediate Representations (IRs)\uc758 \ubc30\ud3ec \ud2b9\uc131\uc774 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc138\ud2b8\uc758 \uba64\ubc84\uc2ed \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc720\ucd9c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc5b4 Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc774 \uc874\uc7ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "LM-DP-SGD\ub294 \ud37c\ube14\ub9ad \uc100\ub3c4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uc100\ub3c4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\uace0, \ud6c8\ub828/\ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ubd84\ud560\uc5d0\uc11c \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\ubcc4 IR\uc744 \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\uba70, \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\ubcc4 MIA \uc801\ub300\uc790\ub97c \uc801\ud569\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 LM-DP-SGD\uac00 \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc \uc608\uc0b0 \ud558\uc5d0 \ud53c\ud06c IR \uc218\uc900\uc758 MIA \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uba74\uc11c \uc720\ud2f8\ub9ac\ud2f0\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "LM-DP-SGD\ub294 \uace0\uc720\ud55c \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc-\uc720\ud2f8\ub9ac\ud2f0 \ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ub4dc\uc624\ud504\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba74\uc11c, \uace0\uc815 \ub178\uc774\uc988 \ud06c\uae30 \ud558\uc5d0 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\ubcc4 \uc801\uc808\ud55c \ubcf4\ud638\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc784\ubca0\ub529-\uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4(EaaI) \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c, \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc911\uac04 \ud45c\ud604(IRs)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc9c8\uc758\ub97c \ubc1b\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Griffiths"], "title": "Cognitive Models and AI Algorithms Provide Templates for Designing Language Agents", "comment": null, "summary": "While contemporary large language models (LLMs) are increasingly capable in isolation, there are still many difficult problems that lie beyond the abilities of a single LLM. For such tasks, there is still uncertainty about how best to take many LLMs as parts and combine them into a greater whole. This position paper argues that potential blueprints for designing such modular language agents can be found in the existing literature on cognitive models and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms.

Furthermore, to circumvent the need for any concentrability coefficient, we turn to the interactive setting. We provide the first, computationally efficient, interactive MAIL algorithm for linear Markov games and show that its sample complexity depends only on the dimension of the feature map $d$.

Wong"], "title": "Agentic AI for Intent-driven Optimization in Cell-free O-RAN", "comment": "Accepted by IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC), Glasgow, UK, May 2026", "summary": "Agentic artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a key enabler for autonomous radio access networks (RANs), where multiple large language model (LLM)-based agents reason and collaborate to achieve operator-defined intents. The open RAN (O-RAN) architecture enables the deployment and coordination of such agents. However, most existing works consider simple intents handled by independent agents, while complex intents that require coordination among agents remain unexplored. In this paper, we propose an agentic AI framework for intent translation and optimization in cell-free O-RAN. A supervisor agent translates the operator intents into an optimization objective and minimum rate requirements. Based on this information, a user weighting agent retrieves relevant prior experience from a memory module to determine the user priority weights for precoding. If the intent includes an energy-saving objective, then an open radio unit (O-RU) management agent will also be activated to determine the set of active O-RUs by using a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm. A monitoring agent measures and monitors the user data rates and coordinates with other agents to guarantee the minimum rate requirements are satisfied. To enhance scalability, we adopt a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method that enables the same underlying LLM to be used for different agents.

To enable more fine-grained policy updates, recent research has increasingly shifted toward stepwise group-based policy optimization, which treats each step in a rollout trajectory independently while using a memory module to retain historical context. However, we find a key issue in estimating stepwise relative advantages, namely context inconsistency, where steps within the same group may differ in their historical contexts. Empirically, we reveal that this issue can lead to severely biased advantage estimation, thereby degrading policy optimization significantly. To address the issue, in this paper, we propose Hierarchy-of-Groups Policy Optimization (HGPO) for long-horizon agentic tasks. Specifically, within a group of rollout trajectories, HGPO assigns each step to multiple hierarchical groups according to the consistency of historical contexts. Then, for each step, HGPO computes distinct advantages within each group and aggregates them with an adaptive weighting scheme. In this way, HGPO can achieve a favorable bias-variance trade-off in stepwise advantage estimation, without extra models or rollouts. Evaluations on two challenging agentic tasks, ALFWorld and WebShop with Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, show that HGPO significantly outperforms existing agentic RL methods under the same computational constraints.

While human experts can provide this missing knowledge, their guidance is often unstructured and unreliable, making its direct integration into an agent's plan problematic. To address this, we introduce AHCE (Active Human-Augmented Challenge Engagement), a framework for on-demand Human-AI collaboration. At its core, the Human Feedback Module (HFM) employs a learned policy to treat the human expert as an interactive reasoning tool. Extensive experiments in Minecraft demonstrate the framework's effectiveness, increasing task success rates by 32% on normal difficulty tasks and nearly 70% on highly difficult tasks, all with minimal human intervention.

For many technologies (e.g. peer-to-peer networks, IoT, multi-agent systems), extending the ability to calculate consensus rankings with guarantees in a decentralized setting, i.e., when preference data is initially distributed across a communicating network, remains a major methodological challenge. Indeed, in recent years, the literature on decentralized computation has mainly focused on computing or optimizing statistics such as arithmetic means using gossip algorithms. The purpose of this article is precisely to study how to achieve reliable consensus on collective rankings using classical rules (e.g. Borda, Copeland) in a decentralized setting, thereby raising new questions, robustness to corrupted nodes, and scalability through reduced communication costs in particular. The approach proposed and analyzed here relies on random gossip communication, allowing autonomous agents to compute global ranking consensus using only local interactions, without coordination or central authority.\n  We provide rigorous convergence guarantees, including explicit rate bounds, for the Borda and Copeland consensus methods. Beyond these rules, we also provide a decentralized implementation of consensus according to the median rank rule and local Kemenization. Extensive empirical evaluations on various network topologies and real and synthetic ranking datasets demonstrate that our algorithms converge quickly and reliably to the correct ranking

To address this, we introduce CourtGuard, a retrieval-augmented multi-agent framework that reimagines safety evaluation as Evidentiary Debate. By orchestrating an adversarial debate grounded in external policy documents, CourtGuard achieves state-of-the-art performance across 7 safety benchmarks, outperforming dedicated policy-following baselines without fine-tuning. Beyond standard metrics, we highlight two critical capabilities: (1) Zero-Shot Adaptability, where our framework successfully generalized to an out-of-domain Wikipedia Vandalism task (achieving 90\\% accuracy) by swapping the reference policy; and (2) Automated Data Curation and Auditing, where we leveraged CourtGuard to curate and audit nine novel datasets of sophisticated adversarial attacks. Our results demonstrate that decoupling safety logic from model weights offers a robust, interpretable, and adaptable path for meeting current and future regulatory requirements in AI governance.", "AI": {"tldr": "CourtGuard\ub294 \uc678\ubd80 \uc815\ucc45 \ubb38\uc11c\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud1a0\ub860\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 LLM\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud604\uc7ac LLM\uc758 \uc548\uc804 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc740 \uc815\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ub41c \ubd84\ub958\uae30\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uba70, \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4 \uaddc\uce59\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub835\ub2e4.", "method": "CourtGuard\ub77c\ub294 \uac80\uc0c9 \ubcf4\uc644 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud574 \uc815\ucc45 \ubb38\uc11c\uc5d0 \uae30\ucd08\ud55c \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud1a0\ub860 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc548\uc804\uc131 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "CourtGuard\ub294 7\uac1c\uc758 \uc548\uc804 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc815\ucc45 \uc900\uc218 \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubaa8\ub378 \uac00\uc911\uce58\uc640 \uc548\uc804 \ub17c\ub9ac\ub97c \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 AI \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4\uc758 \ud604\uc7ac \ubc0f \ubbf8\ub798 \uaddc\uc81c \uc694\uad6c\ub97c \ucda9\uc871\ud558\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud558\uace0 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc801\uc751 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud568\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud604\uc7ac \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \uc548\uc804 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc740 \uc801\uc751\uc758 \uacbd\uc9c1\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc815\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ub41c \ubd84\ub958\uae30\uc5d0 \ud06c\uac8c \uc758\uc874\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4 \uaddc\uce59\uc744 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4dc\ub294 \uc7ac\ud6c8\ub828 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc2dc\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc99d\uac70 \uae30\ubc18 \ud1a0\ub860(Evidentiary Debate)\uc73c\ub85c \uc548\uc804\uc131 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud55c \uac80\uc0c9 \ubcf4\uc644 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 CourtGuard\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc678\ubd80 \uc815\ucc45 \ubb38\uc11c\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud1a0\ub860\uc744 \uc870\uc728\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368, CourtGuard\ub294 7\uac1c\uc758 \uc548\uc804 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc804\ub2f4 \uc815\ucc45 \uc900\uc218 \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ud45c\uc900 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc744 \ub118\uc5b4, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4: (1) \uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7 \uc801\uc751\uc131(Zero-Shot Adaptability)\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ucc38\uc870 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uad50\uccb4\ud558\uc5ec \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc678 \uc704\ud0a4\ud53c\ub514\uc544 \ub099\uc11c(vandalism) \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ud558\uc5ec 90% \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4; (2) \uc790\ub3d9 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud050\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ubc0f \uac10\uc0ac(Automated Data Curation and Auditing)\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 CourtGuard\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\uad50\ud55c \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9\uc758 \uc544\ud649 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \ud050\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud558\uace0 \uac10\uc0ac\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc131\uacf5\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc548\uc804 \ub17c\ub9ac\ub97c \ubaa8\ub378 \uac00\uc911\uce58\uc640 \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 AI \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4\uc758 \ud604\uc7ac \ubc0f \ubbf8\ub798 \uaddc\uc81c \uc694\uad6c\ub97c \ucda9\uc871\ud558\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud558\uace0 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc801\uc751 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud568\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

Submitted for journal consideration", "summary": "We introduce Manifold Sobolev Informed Neural Optimization (MSINO), a curvature aware training framework for neural networks defined on Riemannian manifolds. The method replaces standard Euclidean derivative supervision with a covariant Sobolev loss that aligns gradients using parallel transport and improves stability via a Laplace Beltrami smoothness regularization term.\n  Building on classical results in Riemannian optimization and Sobolev theory on manifolds, we derive geometry dependent constants that yield (i) a Descent Lemma with a manifold Sobolev smoothness constant, (ii) a Sobolev Polyak Lojasiewicz inequality giving linear convergence guarantees for Riemannian gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent under explicit step size bounds, and (iii) a two step Newton Sobolev method with local quadratic contraction in curvature controlled neighborhoods.\n  Unlike prior Sobolev training in Euclidean space, MSINO provides training time guarantees that explicitly track curvature and transported Jacobians. Applications include surface imaging, physics informed learning settings, and robotics on Lie groups such as SO(3) and SE(3). The framework unifies value and gradient based learning with curvature aware convergence guarantees for neural training on manifolds.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub9ac\ub9cc \uae30\ud558\uc801 \ub2e4\uc591\uccb4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\uc758\ub41c \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uace1\ub960 \uc778\uc2dd \ud6c8\ub828 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Manifold Sobolev Informed Neural Optimization (MSINO)\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub9ac\ub9cc \uae30\ud558\uc801 \ub2e4\uc591\uccb4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \ud6c8\ub828\uc758 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0 \uace1\ub960\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud55c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud568\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud45c\uc900 \uc720\ud074\ub9ac\ub4dc \ubbf8\ubd84 \uac10\ub3c5\uc744 \uacf5\ubcc0 \uc18c\ubcfc\ub808\ube0c \uc190\uc2e4\ub85c \ub300\uccb4\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\uc6b8\uae30\ub97c \uc815\ub82c\ud558\uace0, \ub77c\ud50c\ub77c\uc2a4 \ubca8\ud2b8\ub77c\ubbf8 \ub9e4\ub044\ub7ec\uc6b4 \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \ud56d\uc744 \ucd94\uac00\ud558\uc5ec \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub9ac\ub9cc \uae30\ud558 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubc0f \uc18c\ubcfc\ub808\ube0c \uc774\ub860\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uc5ec \uc5bb\uc740 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc758\uc874\uc801\uc778 \uc0c1\uc218\ub4e4\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "MSINO\ub294 \uace1\ub960\uc744 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\uc801\ud558\uba70, \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \ud6c8\ub828\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc218\ub834 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \uc720\uc77c\ud55c \ud6c8\ub828 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub9ac\ub9cc \ub2e4\uc591\uccb4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\uc758\ub41c \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uace1\ub960 \uc778\uc2dd \ud6c8\ub828 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Manifold Sobolev Informed Neural Optimization (MSINO)\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ud45c\uc900 \uc720\ud074\ub9ac\ub4dc \ubbf8\ubd84 \uac10\ub3c5\uc744 \uacf5\ubcc0 \uc18c\ubcfc\ub808\ube0c \uc190\uc2e4\ub85c \ub300\uccb4\ud558\uc5ec \ud3c9\ud589 \uc218\uc1a1\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\uc6b8\uae30\ub97c \uc815\ub82c\ud558\uace0, \ub77c\ud50c\ub77c\uc2a4 \ubca8\ud2b8\ub77c\ubbf8 \ub9e4\ub044\ub7ec\uc6c0 \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \ud56d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub9ac\ub9cc \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubc0f \ub2e4\uc591\uccb4\uc758 \uc18c\ubcfc\ub808\ube0c \uc774\ub860\uc5d0\uc11c \uace0\uc804\uc801\uc778 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uc5ec (i) \ub2e4\uc591\uccb4 \uc18c\ubcfc\ub808\ube0c \ub9e4\ub044\ub7ec\uc6c0 \uc0c1\uc218\ub97c \uac16\ub294 \ud558\uac15 \ub818\ub9c8, (ii) \uba85\uc2dc\uc801 \ub2e8\uacc4 \ud06c\uae30 \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \ub9ac\ub9cc \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \ud558\uac15 \ubc0f \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \ud558\uac15\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc120\ud615 \uc218\ub834 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \uc18c\ubcfc\ub808\ube0c \ud3f4\ub9ac\uc545 \ub85c\uc57c\uc170\ube44\uce20 \ubd88\ud3c9\ub4f1, (iii) \uace1\ub960 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc774\uc6c3\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc801\uc73c\ub85c 2\ucc28 \uc218\ucd95\uc744 \uac16\ub294 \ub274\ud134 \uc18c\ubcfc\ub808\ube0c \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc720\ud074\ub9ac\ub4dc \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\uc804 \uc18c\ubcfc\ub808\ube0c \ud6c8\ub828\uacfc \ub2ec\ub9ac MSINO\ub294 \uace1\ub960\uacfc \uc804\uc1a1\ub41c \uc57c\ucf54\ube44\uc548\uc744 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\uc801\ud558\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc2dc\uac04 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \ud45c\uba74 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9d5, \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc815\ubcf4\uac00 \ud3ec\ud568\ub41c \ud559\uc2b5 \ud658\uacbd, \ubc0f SO(3) \ubc0f SE(3)\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ub9ac \uad70\uc758 \ub85c\ubd07 \uacf5\ud559\uc774 \ud3ec\ud568\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\uccb4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e0\uacbd \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uace1\ub960 \uc778\uc2dd \uc218\ub834 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uacfc \ud568\uaed8 \uac12 \ubc0f \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \uae30\ubc18 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

We show that this instability arises from a previously underexplored gap between strategy usage-whether a reasoning strategy appears in successful solutions-and strategy executability-whether the strategy remains effective when instantiated as guidance for a target model. Through a controlled analysis of paired human-written and model-generated solutions, we identify a systematic dissociation between usage and executability: human- and model-derived strategies differ in structured, domain-dependent ways, leading to complementary strengths and consistent source-dependent reversals under guidance. Building on this diagnosis, we propose Selective Strategy Retrieval (SSR), a test-time framework that explicitly models executability by selectively retrieving and combining strategies using empirical, multi-route, source-aware signals. Across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, SSR yields reliable and consistent improvements over direct solving, in-context learning, and single-source guidance, improving accuracy by up to $+13$ points on AIME25 and $+5$ points on Apex for compact reasoning models.

In such tasks, the LLM context is dominated by tokens from external retrieval, causing memory usage to grow rapidly and limiting decode performance. While several KV cache compression techniques exist for long-context inputs, we find that existing heuristics fail to support multi-step reasoning models effectively. We address this challenge with SideQuest -- a novel approach that leverages the Large Reasoning Model (LRM) itself to perform KV cache compression by reasoning about the usefulness of tokens in its context. To prevent the tokens associated with this management process from polluting the model's memory, we frame KV cache compression as an auxiliary task executed in parallel to the main reasoning task. Our evaluations, using a model trained with just 215 samples, show that SideQuest reduces peak token usage by up to 65% on agentic tasks with minimal degradation in accuracy, outperforming heuristic-based KV cache compression techniques.", "AI": {"tldr": "SideQuest\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec KV \uce90\uc2dc \uc555\ucd95\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc5ec \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub7c9\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uba70, \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae34 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub7c9 \uc99d\uac00\uc640 \ub514\ucf54\ub4dc \uc131\ub2a5 \uc81c\ud55c\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "LRM\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud1a0\ud070\uc758 \uc720\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \ucd94\ub860\ud558\uba70, KV \uce90\uc2dc \uc555\ucd95\uc744 \uc8fc \uc791\uc5c5\uacfc \ubcd1\ud589\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ubcf4\uc870 \uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \ud504\ub808\uc774\ubc0d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "215\uac1c\uc758 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud574 SideQuest\uac00 \ud53c\ud06c \ud1a0\ud070 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub7c9\uc744 \ucd5c\ub300 65%\uae4c\uc9c0 \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ucf30\uace0, \uc815\ud655\ub3c4 \uc800\ud558\uac00 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "SideQuest\uac00 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1 \uae30\ubc18 KV \uce90\uc2dc \uc555\ucd95 \uae30\uc220\uc744 \ub2a5\uac00\ud558\uc5ec \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uae34 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uc791\uc5c5\uc740 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc6f9\ud398\uc774\uc9c0\uc640 \ubb38\uc11c\uc5d0 \ubd84\uc0b0\ub41c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ucd94\ub860\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c LLM \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub294 \uc678\ubd80 \uac80\uc0c9\uc5d0\uc11c \uc624\ub294 \ud1a0\ud070\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc9c0\ubc30\ub418\uc5b4 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub7c9\uc774 \uae09\uaca9\ud788 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \ub514\ucf54\ub4dc \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae34 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc785\ub825\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc5ec\ub7ec KV \uce90\uc2dc \uc555\ucd95 \uae30\uc220\uc774 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1\uc740 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 SideQuest\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub378(LRM)\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \ud1a0\ud070\uc758 \uc720\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \ucd94\ub860\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 KV \uce90\uc2dc \uc555\ucd95\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uad00\ub9ac \uc791\uc5c5\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ub41c \ud1a0\ud070\uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\ub97c \uc624\uc5fc\uc2dc\ud0a4\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub3c4\ub85d, KV \uce90\uc2dc \uc555\ucd95\uc744 \uc8fc \ucd94\ub860 \uc791\uc5c5\uacfc \ubcd1\ud589\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\ud589\ub418\ub294 \ubcf4\uc870 \uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \ud504\ub808\uc774\ubc0d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. 215\uac1c\uc758 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c \ud3c9\uac00 \uacb0\uacfc, SideQuest\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud53c\ud06c \ud1a0\ud070 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub7c9\uc744 \ucd5c\ub300 65%\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc904\uc600\uace0, \uc815\ud655\ub3c4 \uc800\ud558\uac00 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 KV \uce90\uc2dc \uc555\ucd95 \uae30\uc220\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

We propose a physics-informed, latent relational framework to model cardiac vortices as interacting nodes in a graph. Our model combines a neural relational inference architecture with physics-inspired interaction energy and birth-death dynamics, yielding a latent graph sensitive to disease severity and intervention level. We first apply this to computational fluid dynamics simulations of aortic coarctation. Learned latent graphs reveal that as the aortic radius narrows, vortex interactions become stronger and more frequent. This leads to a higher graph entropy, correlating monotonically with coarctation severity ($R^2=0.78$, Spearman $|\u03c1|=0.96$).

However, systematic evaluation in real-world mobility settings is hindered by diverse routing demands, non-deterministic mapping services, and limited reproducibility. In this study, we introduce MobilityBench, a scalable benchmark for evaluating LLM-based route-planning agents in real-world mobility scenarios. MobilityBench is constructed from large-scale, anonymized real user queries collected from Amap and covers a broad spectrum of route-planning intents across multiple cities worldwide. To enable reproducible, end-to-end evaluation, we design a deterministic API-replay sandbox that eliminates environmental variance from live services. We further propose a multi-dimensional evaluation protocol centered on outcome validity, complemented by assessments of instruction understanding, planning, tool use, and efficiency. Using MobilityBench, we evaluate multiple LLM-based route-planning agents across diverse real-world mobility scenarios and provide an in-depth analysis of their behaviors and performance. Our findings reveal that current models perform competently on Basic information retrieval and Route Planning tasks, yet struggle considerably with Preference-Constrained Route Planning, underscoring significant room for improvement in personalized mobility applications.

In this paper, we tackle these issues by providing new disagreement-based certificates for the gap between the true risk of any two predictors. We then bound the true risk of the predictor of interest via a surrogate model that enjoys tight generalization guarantees, and evaluating our disagreement bound on an unlabeled dataset. We empirically demonstrate the tightness of the obtained certificates and showcase the versatility of the approach by training surrogate models leveraging three different frameworks: sample compression, model compression and PAC-Bayes theory. Importantly, such guarantees are achieved without modifying the target model, nor adapting the training procedure to the generalization framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uae4a\uc740 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58 \uae30\ubc18 \uc778\uc99d\uc11c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc5ec \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uacbd\uacc4\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0, \ubcf4\uc870 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc608\uce21\uae30\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uacbd\uacc4\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uacbd\uacc4\ub294 \uc885\uc885 \ube48\uc57d\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uacc4\uc0b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\uac70\ub098 \ud2b9\uc815 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4\uc5d0 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub450 \uc608\uce21\uae30 \uc0ac\uc774\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc704\ud5d8 \ucc28\uc774\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58 \uae30\ubc18 \uc778\uc99d\uc11c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0, \ubcf4\uc870 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uad00\uc2ec \uc788\ub294 \uc608\uce21\uae30\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uacbd\uacc4\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ubcf4\uc870 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uba70, \ucd95\uc801\ub41c \uc778\uc99d\uc11c\uc758 \uc5c4\ubc00\ud568\uc744 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ud0c0\uac9f \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc218\uc815\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc808\ucc28\ub97c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0 \ub9de\uac8c \uc870\uc815\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uacbd\uacc4\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc758\ubbf8\uac00 \uc5c6\uac70\ub098 \uacc4\uc0b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\uac70\ub098 \ud2b9\uc815 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4\uc5d0 \uc81c\ud55c\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub450 \uc608\uce21\uae30 \uac04\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc704\ud5d8 \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58 \uae30\ubc18 \uc778\uc99d\uc11c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7f0 \ub2e4\uc74c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uae34\ubc00\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744\u4eab\u6709\ud558\ub294 \ubcf4\uc870 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uad00\uc2ec \uc788\ub294 \uc608\uce21\uae30\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uacbd\uacc4\ud558\uace0, \ube44\ud45c\uc2dc \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubd88\uc77c\uce58 \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5bb\uc740 \uc778\uc99d\uc11c\uc758 \uc5c4\ubc00\ud568\uc744 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uace0, \ud45c\ubcf8 \uc555\ucd95, \ubaa8\ub378 \uc555\ucd95 \ubc0f PAC-\ubca0\uc774\uc988 \uc774\ub860\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf4\uc870 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \ub2e4\uc7ac\ub2e4\ub2a5\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uac83\uc740 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc774 \ud0c0\uac9f \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc218\uc815\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc808\ucc28\ub97c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0 \ub9de\uac8c \uc870\uc815\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0\ub3c4 \ub2ec\uc131\ub41c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

As these agents operate over extended interaction horizons, their effectiveness increasingly depends on adapting behavior to individual users and maintaining continuity across time, giving rise to personalized LLM-powered agents. In such long-term, user-dependent settings, personalization permeates the entire decision pipeline rather than remaining confined to surface-level generation. This survey provides a capability-oriented review of personalized LLM-powered agents. We organize the literature around four interdependent components: profile modeling, memory, planning, and action execution. Using this taxonomy, we synthesize representative methods and analyze how user signals are represented, propagated, and utilized, highlighting cross-component interactions and recurring design trade-offs. We further examine evaluation metrics and benchmarks tailored to personalized agents, summarize application scenarios spanning general assistance to specialized domains, and outline future directions for research and deployment.

Continual fine-tuning and in-context learning are costly and brittle, whereas neural memory methods promise lightweight updates with minimal forgetting. However, existing neural memory models typically assume a single fixed objective and homogeneous information streams, leaving users with no control over what the model remembers or ignores over time. To address this challenge, we propose a generalized neural memory system that performs flexible updates based on learning instructions specified in natural language.

However, a significant gap exists between practical applications and current evaluation standards for agent memory: existing benchmarks primarily focus on dialogue-centric, human-agent interactions. In reality, agent memory consists of a continuous stream of agent-environment interactions that are primarily composed of machine-generated representations. To bridge this gap, we introduce AMA-Bench (Agent Memory with Any length), which evaluates long-horizon memory for LLMs in real agentic applications. It features two key components: (1) a set of real-world agentic trajectories across representative agentic applications, paired with expert-curated QA, and (2) a set of synthetic agentic trajectories that scale to arbitrary horizons, paired with rule-based QA. Our comprehensive study shows that existing memory systems underperform on AMA-Bench primarily because they lack causality and objective information and are constrained by the lossy nature of similarity-based retrieval employed by many memory systems. To address these limitations, we propose AMA-Agent, an effective memory system featuring a causality graph and tool-augmented retrieval. Our results demonstrate that AMA-Agent achieves 57.22% average accuracy on AMA-Bench, surpassing the strongest memory system baselines by 11.16%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774

Without reliable UQ, FL systems risk deploying overconfident models at under-resourced agents, leading to silent local failures despite seemingly satisfactory global performance. Existing federated UQ approaches often address data heterogeneity or model heterogeneity in isolation, overlooking their joint effect on coverage reliability across agents. Conformal prediction is a widely used distribution-free UQ framework, yet its applications in heterogeneous FL settings remains underexplored. We provide FedWQ-CP, a simple yet effective approach that balances empirical coverage performance with efficiency at both global and agent levels under the dual heterogeneity. FedWQ-CP performs agent-server calibration in a single communication round. On each agent, conformity scores are computed on calibration data and a local quantile threshold is derived. Each agent then transmits only its quantile threshold and calibration sample size to the server. The server simply aggregates these thresholds through a weighted average to produce a global threshold.

Although recent agent frameworks aim to enhance model autonomy through tool integration and external interaction, they still suffer from naive workflows, unstable performance, limited support across diverse benchmarks and tasks, and heavy reliance on costly commercial APIs. In this work, we propose a high-performance and robust open-source agent framework, termed MiroFlow, which incorporates an agent graph for flexible orchestration, an optional deep reasoning mode to enhance performance, and a robust workflow execution to ensure stable and reproducible performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MiroFlow consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple agent benchmarks, including GAIA, BrowseComp-EN/ZH, HLE, xBench-DeepSearch, and notably FutureX.

A Human-Centered Model of Scene, Context, and Behavior for Agentic AI Design", "comment": null, "summary": "Agentic AI increasingly intervenes proactively by inferring users' situations from contextual data yet often fails for lack of principled judgment about when, why, and whether to act. We address this gap by proposing a conceptual model that reframes behavior as an interpretive outcome integrating Scene (observable situation), Context (user-constructed meaning), and Human Behavior Factors (determinants shaping behavioral likelihood). Grounded in multidisciplinary perspectives across the humanities, social sciences, HCI, and engineering, the model separates what is observable from what is meaningful to the user and explains how the same scene can yield different behavioral meanings and outcomes. To translate this lens into design action, we derive five agent design principles (behavioral alignment, contextual sensitivity, temporal appropriateness, motivational calibration, and agency preservation) that guide intervention depth, timing, intensity, and restraint. Together, the model and principles provide a foundation for designing agentic AI systems that act with contextual sensitivity and judgment in interactions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ud589\ub3d9\uc801 AI\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc758 \uc0c1\ud669\uc744 \ucd94\ub860\ud558\uc5ec \uc801\uadf9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac1c\uc785\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc5b8\uc81c, \uc65c, \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ud589\ub3d9\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc6d0\uce59\uc801\uc778 \ud310\ub2e8\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\ud328\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud574\uc11d\uc801 \uacb0\uacfc\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uac1c\ub150 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uad00\ucc30 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc7a5\uba74, \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \uc758\ubbf8, \ud589\ub3d9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud615\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc694\uc778\ub4e4\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uac19\uc740 \uc7a5\uba74\uc774 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ub2e4\ub978 \ud589\ub3d9\uc801 \uc758\ubbf8\uc640 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc124\uba85\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud589\ub3d9\uc801 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub2e4\uc12f \uac00\uc9c0 \ub514\uc790\uc778 \uc6d0\uce59\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud589\ub3d9\uc801 AI\uac00 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc801\uc808\ud558\uac8c \uac1c\uc785\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud310\ub2e8 \uae30\uc900\uc758 \uacb0\uc5ec\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc744 \uc791\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uac1c\ub150 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc7a5\uba74, \ub9e5\ub77d, \uc778\uac04 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc694\uc778\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud574\uc11d\uc801 \uacb0\uacfc\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uac19\uc740 \uc7a5\uba74\uc774 \ub2e4\ub978 \ud589\ub3d9\uc801 \uc758\ubbf8\uc640 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud558\uc600\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\uc12f \uac00\uc9c0 \ub514\uc790\uc778 \uc6d0\uce59\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ub514\uc790\uc778 \uc6d0\uce59\uc740 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0 \ubbfc\uac10\ud558\uac8c \uc791\uc6a9\ud558\uace0 \ud310\ub2e8\ub825\uc744 \uac16\ucd98 \ud589\ub3d9\uc801 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud589\ub3d9\uc801 AI\ub294 \uc0c1\ud669\uc801 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc758 \uc0c1\ud669\uc744 \ucd94\ub860\ud558\uc5ec \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uc801\uadf9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac1c\uc785\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc5b8\uc81c, \uc65c, \uc5b4\ub5a4 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \ud589\ub3d9\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc6d0\uce59\uc801 \ud310\ub2e8\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uc5ec \uc885\uc885 \uc2e4\ud328\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uad00\ucc30 \ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc0c1\ud669(Scene), \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uad6c\uc131 \uc758\ubbf8(Context), \ud589\ub3d9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uacb0\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc694\uc18c(Human Behavior Factors)\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \ud574\uc11d\uc801 \uacb0\uacfc\ub85c\uc11c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uac1c\ub150 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc774 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc778\ubb38\ud559, \uc0ac\ud68c\uacfc\ud559, HCI, \uacf5\ud559 \ub4f1 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uad00\uc810\uc5d0 \uae30\ucd08\ud558\uc5ec, \uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uad00\ucc30 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uac83\uacfc \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc5d0\uac8c \uc758\ubbf8 \uc788\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uad6c\ubd84\ud558\uace0, \uac19\uc740 \uc7a5\uba74\uc774 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ub2e4\ub978 \ud589\ub3d9\uc801 \uc758\ubbf8\uc640 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc124\uba85\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uad00\uc810\uc744 \ub514\uc790\uc778 \ud589\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\ud658\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac1c\uc785 \uae4a\uc774, \ud0c0\uc774\ubc0d, \uac15\ub3c4 \ubc0f \uc790\uc81c\ub825\uc744 \uc548\ub0b4\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc12f \uac00\uc9c0 \ud589\ub3d9 \ub514\uc790\uc778 \uc6d0\uce59(\ud589\ub3d9 \uc815\ub82c, \ub9e5\ub77d \ubbfc\uac10\uc131, \uc2dc\uac04 \uc801\uc808\uc131, \ub3d9\uae30 \uc870\uc815 \ubc0f \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\uc2dc \ubcf4\uc874)\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uc6d0\uce59\uc740 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c \ub9e5\ub77d\uc758 \ubbfc\uac10\uc131\uacfc \ud310\ub2e8\ub825\uc744 \uac16\ucd98 \ud589\ub3d9\uc801 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

Since clients frequently operate on diverse hardware and software frameworks, transmitting a pre-trained model is often infeasible; instead, agents require raw data to train their own task-specific models locally. While dataset distillation attempts to compress training signals, current methods struggle to scale to high-resolution data and rarely achieve sufficiently small files. In this paper, we propose Pseudo-Labels as Data (PLADA), a method that completely eliminates pixel transmission. We assume agents are preloaded with a large, generic, unlabeled reference dataset (e.g., ImageNet-1K, ImageNet-21K) and communicate a new task by transmitting only the class labels for specific images. To address the distribution mismatch between the reference and target datasets, we introduce a pruning mechanism that filters the reference dataset to retain only the labels of the most semantically relevant images for the target task. This selection process simultaneously maximizes training efficiency and minimizes transmission payload. Experiments on 10 diverse datasets demonstrate that our approach can transfer task knowledge with a payload of less than 1 MB while retaining high classification accuracy, offering a promising solution for efficient dataset serving.", "AI": {"tldr": "PLADA\ub294 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uc804\uc1a1 \uc5c6\uc774 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4 \ub808\uc774\ube14\ub9cc \uc804\uc1a1\ud558\uc5ec \ud070 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\ub2ec\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ubc30\ud3ec\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub4dc\ub294 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "PLADA \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uc758 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4 \ub808\uc774\ube14\ub9cc \uc804\uc1a1\ud558\uc5ec \ud53c\uc140 \uc804\uc1a1\uc744 \uc644\uc804\ud788 \uc5c6\uc571\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "10\uac1c\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 1MB \uc774\ud558\uc758 \ud398\uc774\ub85c\ub4dc\ub85c \uc791\uc5c5 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc804\uc1a1\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ub192\uc740 \ubd84\ub958 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b \uc81c\uacf5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b \uc11c\ubc84\ub294 \uc885\uc885 \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc5ec\ub7ec \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ubc30\ud3ec\ud574\uc57c \ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ub9c9\ub300\ud55c \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\uac00 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \ubc0f \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0, \ubbf8\ub9ac \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc804\uc1a1\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \ubd88\uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uba70, \ub300\uc2e0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ud2b9\ud654\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ub85c\uceec\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6d0\uc2dc \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b \uc99d\ub958\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc555\ucd95\ud558\ub824\uace0 \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud604\uc7ac \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uace0\ud574\uc0c1\ub3c4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \uc801\ud569\ud558\uac8c \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \uc791\uc740 \ud30c\uc77c\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\ub3c4 \ub4dc\ubb45\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud53d\uc140 \uc804\uc1a1\uc744 \uc644\uc804\ud788 \uc81c\uac70\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 Pseudo-Labels as Data (PLADA)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc774\uba70 \ub808\uc774\ube14\uc774 \uc5c6\ub294 \ucc38\uc870 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b(\uc608: ImageNet-1K, ImageNet-21K)\uc73c\ub85c \ubbf8\ub9ac \ub85c\ub4dc\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\ub2e4\uace0 \uac00\uc815\ud558\uace0, \ud2b9\uc815 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uc758 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4 \ub808\uc774\ube14\ub9cc \uc804\uc1a1\ud558\uc5ec \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc18c\ud1b5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucc38\uc870 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uacfc \ub300\uc0c1 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b \uac04\uc758 \ubd84\ubc30 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub300\uc0c1 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uac00\uc7a5 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc788\uac8c \uad00\ub828\ub41c \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uc758 \ub808\uc774\ube14\ub9cc \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ucc38\uc870 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \ud544\ud130\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \uac00\uc9c0\uce58\uae30 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc120\ud0dd \uacfc\uc815\uc740 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ud6c8\ub828 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uc804\uc1a1 \ud398\uc774\ub85c\ub4dc\ub97c \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. 10\uac1c\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 1MB \uc774\ud558\uc758 \ud398\uc774\ub85c\ub4dc\ub85c \uc791\uc5c5 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc804\uc1a1\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ub192\uc740 \ubd84\ub958 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b \uc81c\uacf5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, existing presentation agents often rely on predefined workflows and fixed templates. To address this, we present DeepPresenter, an agentic framework that adapts to diverse user intents, enables effective feedback-driven refinement, and generalizes beyond a scripted pipeline. Specifically, DeepPresenter autonomously plans, renders, and revises intermediate slide artifacts to support long-horizon refinement with environmental observations. Furthermore, rather than relying on self-reflection over internal signals (e.g., reasoning traces), our environment-grounded reflection conditions the generation process on perceptual artifact states (e.g., rendered slides), enabling the system to identify and correct presentation-specific issues during execution. Results on the evaluation set covering diverse presentation-generation scenarios show that DeepPresenter achieves state-of-the-art performance, and the fine-tuned 9B model remains highly competitive at substantially lower cost.

Therefore, this paper proposes a Large Language Model Hyperbolic Aligned Knowledge Tracing(L-HAKT). First, the teacher agent deeply parses question semantics and explicitly constructs hierarchical dependencies of knowledge points; the student agent simulates learning behaviors to generate synthetic data. Then, contrastive learning is performed between synthetic and real data in hyperbolic space to reduce distribution differences in key features such as question difficulty and forgetting patterns. Finally, by optimizing hyperbolic curvature, we explicitly model the tree-like hierarchical structure of knowledge points, precisely characterizing differences in learning curve morphology for knowledge points at different levels.

However, current multi-modal LLMs are primarily confined to bi-modal interactions (e.g., vision-language), lacking the unified cognitive capabilities required for general AI assistants. To bridge this gap, we introduce OmniGAIA, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate omni-modal agents on tasks necessitating deep reasoning and multi-turn tool execution across video, audio, and image modalities. Constructed via a novel omni-modal event graph approach, OmniGAIA synthesizes complex, multi-hop queries derived from real-world data that require cross-modal reasoning and external tool integration. Furthermore, we propose OmniAtlas, a native omni-modal foundation agent under tool-integrated reasoning paradigm with active omni-modal perception. Trained on trajectories synthesized via a hindsight-guided tree exploration strategy and OmniDPO for fine-grained error correction, OmniAtlas effectively enhances the tool-use capabilities of existing open-source models. This work marks a step towards next-generation native omni-modal AI assistants for real-world scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "OmniGAIA\ub294 \ube44\ub514\uc624, \uc624\ub514\uc624 \ubc0f \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ubaa8\ub4dc\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uae4a\uc740 \ucd94\ub860\uacfc \uc5ec\ub7ec \ucc28\ub840\uc758 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc2e4\ud589\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 omni-modal \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc885\ud569 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ucc28\uc138\ub300 AI \uc5b4\uc2dc\uc2a4\ud134\ud2b8\ub97c \ud5a5\ud55c \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \ubaa8\uc0c9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \uc8fc\ub85c \uc774\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0 \uad6d\ud55c\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc77c\ubc18 AI \uc5b4\uc2dc\uc2a4\ud134\ud2b8\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569\ub41c \uc778\uc9c0 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "OmniGAIA\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 omni-modal \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uac1c\ubc1c\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \ud30c\uc0dd\ub41c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \ud649 \ubb38\uc758\ub97c \ud569\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\uc2dd \ubaa8\ub4dc \uac04 \ucd94\ub860\uacfc \uc678\ubd80 \ub3c4\uad6c \ud1b5\ud569\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4.\u4f75", "result": "OmniAtlas\ub294 \ub3c4\uad6c \ud1b5\ud569 \ucd94\ub860 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \ub124\uc774\ud2f0\ube0c omni-modal \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c, \uae30\uc874 \uc624\ud508 \uc18c\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud604\uc2e4 \uc138\uacc4 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0 \uc801\ud569\ud55c \ucc28\uc138\ub300 \ub124\uc774\ud2f0\ube0c omni-modal AI \uc5b4\uc2dc\uc2a4\ud134\ud2b8\ub97c \ud5a5\ud55c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc9c4\uc804\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc740 \uc2dc\uac01, \uccad\uac01 \ubc0f \uc5b8\uc5b4\ub97c \uc544\uc6b0\ub974\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \uc778\uc2dd\uc744 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uacfc \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7fd\uac8c \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc138\uacc4\uc640 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \uc8fc\ub85c \uc2dc\uac01-\uc5b8\uc5b4\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc774\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0 \uc81c\ud55c\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc77c\ubc18 AI \uc5b4\uc2dc\uc2a4\ud134\ud2b8\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569\ub41c \uc778\uc9c0 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uc18c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ube44\ub514\uc624, \uc624\ub514\uc624 \ubc0f \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ubaa8\ub4dc\uc5d0\uc11c \uae4a\uc740 \ucd94\ub860\uacfc \uc5ec\ub7ec \ucc28\ub840\uc758 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc2e4\ud589\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 omni-modal \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc885\ud569 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc778 OmniGAIA\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4.

Existing agents are predominantly specialized, and while emerging implementations like OpenAI SDK Agent and Claude Code hint at broader capabilities, no systematic evaluation of their general performance has been pursued. Current agentic benchmarks assume domain-specific integration, encoding task information in ways that preclude fair evaluation of general agents. This paper frames general-agent evaluation as a first-class research objective. We propose conceptual principles for such evaluation, a Unified Protocol enabling agent-benchmark integration, and Exgentic - a practical framework for general agent evaluation. We benchmark five prominent agent implementations across six environments as the first Open General Agent Leaderboard. Our experiments show that general agents generalize across diverse environments, achieving performance comparable to domain-specific agents without any environment-specific tuning.

To address these limitations, we propose FactGuard, an agentic framework for video misinformation detection that formulates verification as an iterative reasoning process built upon MLLMs. FactGuard explicitly assesses task ambiguity and selectively invokes external tools to acquire critical evidence, enabling progressive refinement of reasoning trajectories. To further strengthen this capability, we introduce a two-stage training strategy that combines domain-specific agentic supervised fine-tuning with decision-aware reinforcement learning to optimize tool usage and calibrate risk-sensitive decision making. Extensive experiments on FakeSV, FakeTT, and FakeVV demonstrate FactGuard's state-of-the-art performance and validate its excellent robustness and generalization capacity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \ube44\ub514\uc624 \ud5c8\uc704 \uc815\ubcf4 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \uc704\ud574 FactGuard\ub77c\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ube44\ub514\uc624 \ud5c8\uc704 \uc815\ubcf4 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc815\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \uae4a\uc774\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uace0 \ub0b4\ubd80 \uc0dd\uc131 \uac00\uc815\uc5d0 \uc9c0\ub098\uce58\uac8c \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud574\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "FactGuard\ub294 MLLM\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub85c \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uba70, \uc791\uc5c5 \ubaa8\ud638\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc678\ubd80 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uc120\ud0dd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud638\ucd9c\ud558\uc5ec \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc99d\uac70\ub97c \ud68d\ub4dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "FakeSV, FakeTT, FakeVV\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, FactGuard\ub294 \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uacac\uace0\uc131\uacfc \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uacb0\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, FactGuard\ub294 \ube44\ub514\uc624 \ud5c8\uc704 \uc815\ubcf4 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubaa8\ub4dc\uc758 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(MLLM)\uc740 \ud1b5\ud569\ub41c \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ube44\ub514\uc624 \ud5c8\uc704 \uc815\ubcf4 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uace0\uc815 \uae4a\uc774 \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uace0 \ub0b4\ubd80\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \uac00\uc815\uc5d0 \uacfc\ub3c4\ud558\uac8c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\uc544, \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc99d\uac70\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ub2e8\ud3b8\ud654\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uac70\ub098 \uc678\ubd80 \uac80\uc99d\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 MLLM\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uc5ec \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub85c \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ube44\ub514\uc624 \ud5c8\uc704 \uc815\ubcf4 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 FactGuard\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

This paper proposes a reinforcement learning approach for multi-agent race strategy optimization. Agents learn to balance energy management, tire degradation, aerodynamic interaction, and pit-stop decisions. Building on a pre-trained single-agent policy, we introduce an interaction module that accounts for the behavior of competitors. The combination of the interaction module and a self-play training scheme generates competitive policies, and agents are ranked based on their relative performance. Results show that the agents adapt pit timing, tire selection, and energy allocation in response to opponents, achieving robust and consistent race performance. Because the framework relies only on information available during real races, it can support race strategists' decisions before and during races.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ub808\uc774\uc2a4 \uc804\ub7b5 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud3ec\ubbac\ub7ec 1\uc5d0\uc11c \ub808\uc774\uc2a4 \uc804\ub7b5\uc740 \ubcc0\ud558\ub294 \ub808\uc774\uc2a4 \uc870\uac74\uacfc \uacbd\uc7c1\uc790\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc870\uc815\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uad00\ub9ac, \ud0c0\uc774\uc5b4 \ub9c8\ubaa8, \uacf5\uae30\uc5ed\ud559\uc801 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ubc0f \ud53c\ud2b8 \uc2a4\ud1b1 \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uade0\ud615 \uc788\uac8c \ud559\uc2b5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \uacbd\uc7c1\uc790\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud558\ub294 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uacfc \uc790\uae30 \ub180\uc774 \ud6c8\ub828 \uacc4\ud68d\uc758 \uc870\ud569\uc740 \uacbd\uc7c1\uc801\uc778 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc0c1\ub300 \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc21c\uc704\uac00 \ub9e4\uaca8\uc9d1\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc0c1\ub300\uc5d0 \ub300\uc751\ud558\uc5ec \ud53c\ud2b8 \ud0c0\uc774\ubc0d, \ud0c0\uc774\uc5b4 \uc120\ud0dd \ubc0f \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \ubc30\ubd84\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \uac15\uac74\ud558\uace0 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \ub808\uc774\uc2a4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \ub808\uc774\uc2a4 \uc911\uc5d0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc815\ubcf4\ub9cc\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\ubbc0\ub85c \ub808\uc774\uc2a4 \uc804\ub7b5\uac00\uc758 \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud3ec\ubbac\ub7ec 1\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub808\uc774\uc2a4 \uc804\ub7b5\uc774 \ubcc0\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub808\uc774\uc2a4 \uc870\uac74\uacfc \uacbd\uc7c1\uc790\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc870\uc815\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ub808\uc774\uc2a4 \uc804\ub7b5 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc740 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uad00\ub9ac, \ud0c0\uc774\uc5b4 \ub9c8\ubaa8, \uacf5\uae30\uc5ed\ud559\uc801 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ubc0f \ud53c\ud2b8 \uc2a4\ud1b1 \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uade0\ud615 \uc788\uac8c \ud559\uc2b5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \uacbd\uc7c1\uc790\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud558\ub294 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uacfc \uc790\uae30 \ub180\uc774 \ud6c8\ub828 \uacc4\ud68d\uc758 \uc870\ud569\uc740 \uacbd\uc7c1\uc801\uc778 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc0c1\ub300\uc801\uc778 \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc21c\uc704\uac00 \ub9e4\uaca8\uc9d1\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc0c1\ub300\uc5d0 \ub300\uc751\ud558\uc5ec \ud53c\ud2b8 \ud0c0\uc774\ubc0d, \ud0c0\uc774\uc5b4 \uc120\ud0dd \ubc0f \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \ubc30\ubd84\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \uac15\uac74\ud558\uace0 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \ub808\uc774\uc2a4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \ub808\uc774\uc2a4 \uc911 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc815\ubcf4\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc5b4 \ub808\uc774\uc2a4 \uc804\ub7b5\uac00\uc758 \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

We study a simplified version of this setting using a framework where N AI-agents independently decide at each round whether to request one unit from a system with fixed capacity C. An AI version of \"Lord of the Flies\" arises in which controlling tribes emerge with their own collective character and identity. The LLM agents do not reduce overload or improve resource use, and often perform worse than if they were flipping coins to make decisions. Three main tribal types emerge: Aggressive (27.3%), Conservative (24.7%), and Opportunistic (48.1%). The more capable AI-agents actually increase the rate of systemic failure. Overall, our findings show that smarter AI-agents can behave dumber as a result of forming tribes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc790\uc728 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc790\uc6d0\uc5d0 \uc811\uadfc\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc790\uc8fc \uc694\uccad\ud558\ub294 \uc778\ud504\ub77c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 N\uba85\uc758 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uace0\uc815 \uc6a9\ub7c9 C\uc758 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc694\uccad \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ub0b4\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud654\ub41c \uc124\uc815\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \ubd80\uc871 \uc720\ud615\uc774 \ub098\ud0c0\ub098\uba70, \ub354 \uc720\ub2a5\ud55c AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc624\ud788\ub824 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc2e4\ud328\uc728\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2a4\uc2a4\ub85c \uc790\uc6d0\uc744 \uc694\uccad\ud558\ub294 \uc790\uc728 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ud1b5\uc81c\ud558\ub294 \uc778\ud504\ub77c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud589\ud0dc\ub97c \uc774\ud574\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud568\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "N\uba85\uc758 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uac01 \ub77c\uc6b4\ub4dc\ub9c8\ub2e4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uace0\uc815 \uc6a9\ub7c9 C\uc5d0\uc11c \ud558\ub098\uc758 \ub2e8\uc704\ub97c \uc694\uccad\ud560\uc9c0 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uacb0\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \ubd80\uc871 \uc720\ud615\uc774 \ub4f1\uc7a5\ud558\uba70, AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc790\uc6d0\uc744 \uc694\uccad\ud560 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\ub300\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub098\uc05c \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \uac70\ub461\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub354 \ub611\ub611\ud55c AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\uc744 \ud615\uc131\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ub354 \ub35c \ub611\ub611\ud558\uac8c \ud589\ub3d9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uadfc\ubbf8\ub798\uc758 \uc778\ud504\ub77c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0, \ub300\uc5ed\ud3ed \ub610\ub294 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305 \ud30c\uc6cc\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc790\uc6d0\uc5d0 \uc811\uadfc\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc694\uccad\ud558\ub294 \uc790\uc728 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 N\uba85\uc758 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uace0\uc815 \uc6a9\ub7c9 C\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uac01 \ub77c\uc6b4\ub4dc\ub9c8\ub2e4 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\ub098\uc758 \ub2e8\uc704\ub97c \uc694\uccad\ud560\uc9c0\ub97c \uacb0\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 \uc124\uc815\uc758 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud654\ub41c \ubc84\uc804\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5ec\uae30\uc11c \ubd80\uc871\uc774 \ucd9c\ud604\ud558\uace0 \uac01 \ubd80\uc871\uc740 \uace0\uc720\uc758 \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc801 \uc131\uaca9\uacfc \uc815\uccb4\uc131\uc744 \uac16\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

This study proposes Multi-Agent LLM-based Emotional deToxification (MALLET), a multi-agent information sanitization system consisting of four agents: Emotion Analysis, Emotion Adjustment, Balance Monitoring, and Personal Guide. The Emotion Analysis Agent quantifies stimulus intensity using a 6-emotion BERT classifier, and the Emotion Adjustment Agent rewrites texts into two presentation modes, BALANCED (neutralized text) and COOL (neutralized text + supplementary text), using an LLM. The Balance Monitoring Agent aggregates weekly information consumption patterns and generates personalized advice, while the Personal Guide Agent recommends a presentation mode according to consumer sensitivity. Experiments on 800 AG News articles demonstrated significant stimulus score reduction (up to 19.3%) and improved emotion balance while maintaining semantic preservation. Near-zero correlation between stimulus reduction and semantic preservation confirmed that the two are independently controllable. Category-level analysis revealed substantial reduction (17.8-33.8%) in Sports, Business, and Sci/Tech, whereas the effect was limited in the World category, where facts themselves are inherently high-stimulus.

Includes 5 technical appendices", "summary": "Autonomous agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved from reactive assistants to systems capable of planning, executing actions via tools, and iterating over environment observations. However, they remain vulnerable to structural limitations: lack of native state, context degradation over long horizons, and the gap between probabilistic generation and deterministic execution requirements. This paper presents the ESAA (Event Sourcing for Autonomous Agents) architecture, which separates the agent's cognitive intention from the project's state mutation, inspired by the Event Sourcing pattern. In ESAA, agents emit only structured intentions in validated JSON (agent.result or issue.report); a deterministic orchestrator validates, persists events in an append-only log (activity.jsonl), applies file-writing effects, and projects a verifiable materialized view (roadmap.json). The proposal incorporates boundary contracts (AGENT_CONTRACT.yaml), metaprompting profiles (PARCER), and replay verification with hashing (esaa verify), ensuring the immutability of completed tasks and forensic traceability. Two case studies validate the architecture: (i) a landing page project (9 tasks, 49 events, single-agent composition) and (ii) a clinical dashboard system (50 tasks, 86 events, 4 concurrent agents across 8 phases), both concluding with run.status=success and verify_status=ok.

Inspired by Humphrey's ipsundrum hypothesis, we implement ReCoN-Ipsundrum, an inspectable agent that extends a ReCoN state machine with a recurrent persistence loop over sensory salience Ns and an optional affect proxy reporting valence/arousal. Across fixed-parameter ablations (ReCoN, Ipsundrum, Ipsundrum+affect), we operationalize Humphrey's qualiaphilia (preference for sensory experience for its own sake) as a familiarity-controlled scenic-over-dull route choice. We find a novelty dissociation: non-affect variants are novelty-sensitive (Delta scenic-entry = 0.07). Affect coupling is stable (Delta scenic-entry = 0.01) even when scenic is less novel (median Delta novelty ~ -0.43). In reward-free exploratory play, the affect variant shows structured local investigation (scan events 31.4 vs. 0.9; cycle score 7.6). In a pain-tail probe, only the affect variant sustains prolonged planned caution (tail duration 90 vs. 5). Lesioning feedback+integration selectively reduces post-stimulus persistence in ipsundrum variants (AUC drop 27.62, 27.9%) while leaving ReCoN unchanged.

Under journal review", "summary": "AI systems are increasingly deployed in high-stakes contexts -- medical diagnosis, legal research, financial analysis -- under the assumption they can be governed by norms. This paper demonstrates that assumption is formally invalid for optimization-based systems, specifically Large Language Models trained via Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). We establish that genuine agency requires two necessary and jointly sufficient architectural conditions: the capacity to maintain certain boundaries as non-negotiable constraints rather than tradeable weights (Incommensurability), and a non-inferential mechanism capable of suspending processing when those boundaries are threatened (Apophatic Responsiveness). These conditions apply across all normative domains.\n  RLHF-based systems are constitutively incompatible with both conditions. The operations that make optimization powerful -- unifying all values on a scalar metric and always selecting the highest-scoring output -- are precisely the operations that preclude normative governance. This incompatibility is not a correctable training bug awaiting a technical fix; it is a formal constraint inherent to what optimization is. Consequently, documented failure modes - sycophancy, hallucination, and unfaithful reasoning - are not accidents but structural manifestations.\n  Misaligned deployment triggers a second-order risk we term the Convergence Crisis: when humans are forced to verify AI outputs under metric pressure, they degrade from genuine agents into criteria-checking optimizers, eliminating the only component in the system capable of normative accountability.

Current solutions often resort to rigid structural engineering or expensive fine-tuning, limiting their deployability and adaptability. We propose AgentDropoutV2, a test-time rectify-or-reject pruning framework designed to dynamically optimize MAS information flow without retraining. Our approach acts as an active firewall, intercepting agent outputs and employing a retrieval-augmented rectifier to iteratively correct errors based on a failure-driven indicator pool. This mechanism allows for the precise identification of potential errors using distilled failure patterns as prior knowledge. Irreparable outputs are subsequently pruned to prevent error propagation, while a fallback strategy preserves system integrity. Empirical results on extensive math benchmarks show that AgentDropoutV2 significantly boosts the MAS's task performance, achieving an average accuracy gain of 6.3 percentage points on math benchmarks.

Despite recent improvements in research quality (e.g., outcome accuracy when ground truth is available), DRA system design often overlooks a critical barrier to real-world deployment: stochasticity. Under identical queries, repeated executions of DRAs can exhibit substantial variability in terms of research outcome, findings, and citations. In this paper, we formalize the study of stochasticity in DRAs by modeling them as information acquisition Markov Decision Processes. We introduce an evaluation framework that quantifies variance in the system and identify three sources of it: information acquisition, information compression, and inference. Through controlled experiments, we investigate how stochasticity from these modules across different decision steps influences the variance of DRA outputs. Our results show that reducing stochasticity can improve research output quality, with inference and early-stage stochasticity contributing the most to DRA output variance. Based on these findings, we propose strategies for mitigating stochasticity while maintaining output quality via structured output and ensemble-based query generation. Our experiments on DeepSearchQA show that our proposed mitigation methods reduce average stochasticity by 22% while maintaining high research quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 Deep Research Agents(DRA)\uc758 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \uc904\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "DRA \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc124\uacc4\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc138\uacc4 \ubc30\ud3ec\uc758 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc7a5\ubcbd\uc778 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uac04\uacfc\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 DRA\ub97c \uc815\ubcf4 \ud68d\ub4dd \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uace0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc744 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ud3c9\uac00 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uba74 \uc5f0\uad6c \uacb0\uacfc\uc758 \uc9c8\uc774 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\uba70, \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \ucd08\uae30 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc758 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc774 DRA \ucd9c\ub825 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc5d0 \uac00\uc7a5 \ud070 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ucd9c\ub825 \ubc0f \uc559\uc0c1\ube14 \uae30\ubc18 \ucffc\ub9ac \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ucd9c\ub825 \uc9c8\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "Deep Research Agents(DRAs)\ub294 \uc7ac\ubb34 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815, \uc758\ub8cc \ubd84\uc11d \ubc0f \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \ubc1c\uacac\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc218\uc9d1\ud558\uace0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc \uc5f0\uad6c \ud488\uc9c8\uc774 \uac1c\uc120\ub418\uc5c8\uc74c\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0(DRA \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \ubc30\ud3ec\uc758 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc7a5\ubcbd\uc778 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uc885\uc885 \uac04\uacfc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \ucffc\ub9ac \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c DRA\uc758 \ubc18\ubcf5 \uc2e4\ud589\uc740 \uc5f0\uad6c \uacb0\uacfc, \ubc1c\uacac \ubc0f \uc778\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 DRA\uc758 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uc815\ubcf4 \ud68d\ub4dd \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uc5ec \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ud615\uc2dd\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc744 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ud3c9\uac00 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0, \uc815\ubcf4 \ud68d\ub4dd, \uc815\ubcf4 \uc555\ucd95 \ubc0f \ucd94\ub860\uc758 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc18c\uc2a4\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc5b4\ub41c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc758 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc774 DRA \ucd9c\ub825\uc758 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uba74 \uc5f0\uad6c \ucd9c\ub825 \ud488\uc9c8\uc774 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\uba70, \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \ucd08\uae30 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc758 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc774 DRA \ucd9c\ub825 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc5d0 \uac00\uc7a5 \ud070 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \ucd9c\ub825 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ucd9c\ub825 \ubc0f \uc559\uc0c1\ube14 \uae30\ubc18 \ucffc\ub9ac \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, large vision-language models (LVLMs) often generate plausible responses that are not faithfully grounded in diagnostic evidence and provide limited visual evidence for verification, while also requiring costly retraining to support new diagnostic tasks, limiting their reliability and adaptability in clinical settings. To address these limitations, we present CXReasonAgent, a diagnostic agent that integrates a large language model (LLM) with clinically grounded diagnostic tools to perform evidence-grounded diagnostic reasoning using image-derived diagnostic and visual evidence. To evaluate these capabilities, we introduce CXReasonDial, a multi-turn dialogue benchmark with 1,946 dialogues across 12 diagnostic tasks, and show that CXReasonAgent produces faithfully grounded responses, enabling more reliable and verifiable diagnostic reasoning than LVLMs. These findings highlight the importance of integrating clinically grounded diagnostic tools, particularly in safety-critical clinical settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "CXReasonAgent\ub294 X\uc120 \uc9c4\ub2e8\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc99d\uac70 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ub354 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc9c4\ub2e8 \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc758 \ub3d9\uae30\ub294 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub300\ud615 \ube44\uc804-\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc9c4\ub2e8 \uc99d\uac70\uc5d0 \uc81c\ub300\ub85c \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud568\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uacfc \uc784\uc0c1 \uae30\ubc18 \uc9c4\ub2e8 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc99d\uac70 \uae30\ubc18 \uc9c4\ub2e8 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 CXReasonAgent\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "CXReasonAgent\ub294 12\uac00\uc9c0 \uc9c4\ub2e8 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c 1,946\uac1c\uc758 \ub300\ud654\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \ub2e4\uc911 \ub300\ud654 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc778 CXReasonDial\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 LVLMs\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uace0 \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc9c4\ub2e8 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ud2b9\ud788 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc784\uc0c1 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc784\uc0c1\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c0\uc9c0\ub418\ub294 \uc9c4\ub2e8 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc758 \ud1b5\ud569\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud749\ubd80 \uc5d1\uc2a4\ub808\uc774\ub294 \ud749\ubd80 \uc9c4\ub2e8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc2ec\uc801 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud558\uba70, \uadf8 \ud574\uc11d\uc740 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4\uc758 \uc99d\uac70 \uae30\ubc18 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ub300\ud615 \ube44\uc804-\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LVLM)\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uc9c4\ub2e8 \uc99d\uac70\uc5d0 \ucda9\uc2e4\ud558\uac8c \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uadf8\ub7f4\ub4ef\ud55c \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \uc99d\uac70\ub97c \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0, \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc9c4\ub2e8 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4dc\ub294 \uc7ac\uad50\uc721\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uc5ec \uc784\uc0c1 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uacfc \uc801\uc751\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\ub3c4\ub41c \uc9c4\ub2e8 \ubc0f \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \uc99d\uac70\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc99d\uac70 \uae30\ubc18 \uc9c4\ub2e8 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \uc784\uc0c1\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uc9c4\ub2e8 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc640 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \uc9c4\ub2e8 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 CXReasonAgent\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 12\uac1c\uc758 \uc9c4\ub2e8 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 1,946\uac1c\uc758 \ub300\ud654\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \ub2e4\uc911 \ub300\ud654 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc778 CXReasonDial\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0, CXReasonAgent\uac00 LVLM\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uace0 \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc9c4\ub2e8 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc1c\uacac\uc740 \ud2b9\ud788 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc784\uc0c1 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc784\uc0c1\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c0\uc9c0\ub418\ub294 \uc9c4\ub2e8 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc758 \ud1b5\ud569\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Once designed and well trained, the AI model is applied for inference. However, even optimized AI models can produce inference errors due to aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. Interestingly, we observed that when inferring multiple samples based on invariant transformations of an input, inference errors can show partial independences due to epistemic uncertainty. Leveraging this insight, we propose a \"resampling\" based inferencing that applies to a trained AI model with multiple transformed versions of an input, and aggregates inference outputs to a more accurate result.

While mainstream approaches deploy multi-agent systems mimicking analyst and manager roles, they often rely on abstract instructions that overlook the intricacies of real-world workflows, which can lead to degraded inference performance and less transparent decision-making. Therefore, we propose a multi-agent LLM trading framework that explicitly decomposes investment analysis into fine-grained tasks, rather than providing coarse-grained instructions. We evaluate the proposed framework using Japanese stock data, including prices, financial statements, news, and macro information, under a leakage-controlled backtesting setting. Experimental results show that fine-grained task decomposition significantly improves risk-adjusted returns compared to conventional coarse-grained designs. Crucially, further analysis of intermediate agent outputs suggests that alignment between analytical outputs and downstream decision preferences is a critical driver of system performance. Moreover, we conduct standard portfolio optimization, exploiting low correlation with the stock index and the variance of each system's output. This approach achieves superior performance. These findings contribute to the design of agent structure and task configuration when applying LLM agents to trading systems in practical settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc138\ubc00\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \ud22c\uc790 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ubd84\ud574\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 LLM \uac70\ub798 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc5c5\ubb34\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \uac04\uacfc\ud558\uc5ec \ucd94\ub860 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc800\ud558\uc640 \ubd88\ud22c\uba85\ud55c \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud568.", "method": "\ud22c\uc790 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc138\ubd80 \uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 LLM \uac70\ub798 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \uc77c\ubcf8 \uc8fc\uc2dd \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud3c9\uac00\ud568.", "result": "\uc138\ubc00\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5 \ubd84\ud574\uac00 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uac70\uce5c \uc124\uacc4\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ub9ac\uc2a4\ud06c \uc870\uc815 \uc218\uc775\ub960\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uac1c\uc120\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90c.", "conclusion": "LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uac70\ub798 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud560 \ub54c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uad6c\uc870\uc640 \uc791\uc5c5 \uad6c\uc131\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uae30\uc5ec\ud568.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \uc790\uc728 \uae08\uc735 \uac70\ub798 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc8fc\ub958 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ubd84\uc11d\uac00 \ubc0f \uad00\ub9ac\uc790 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ubaa8\ubc29\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ubc30\uce58\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc885\uc885 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc5c5\ubb34 \ud750\ub984\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \uac04\uacfc\ud558\ub294 \ucd94\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \uc9c0\uce68\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \ucd94\ub860 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc800\ud558 \ubc0f \ub35c \ud22c\uba85\ud55c \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud22c\uc790\ub97c \uc138\ubc00\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 LLM \uac70\ub798 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uac70\uce5c \uc9c0\uce68\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \ub300\uc2e0 \uc138\ubd84\ud654\ub41c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac00\uaca9, \uc7ac\ubb34\uc81c\ud45c, \ub274\uc2a4 \ubc0f \uac70\uc2dc \uacbd\uc81c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uc77c\ubcf8 \uc8fc\uc2dd \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub204\uc218 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ubc31\ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc138\ubd84\ud654\ub41c \uc791\uc5c5 \ubd84\ud574\uac00 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uac70\uce5c \uc124\uacc4\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ub9ac\uc2a4\ud06c \uc870\uc815 \uc218\uc775\ub960\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uac1c\uc120\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc911\uac04 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ucd9c\ub825\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucd94\uac00 \ubd84\uc11d\uc740 \ubd84\uc11d \uacb0\uacfc\uc640 \ud558\uc704 \uacb0\uc815 \uc120\ud638 \uac04\uc758 \uc815\ub82c\uc774 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc131\ub2a5\uc758 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc6d0\ub3d9\ub825\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4. furthermore, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac01 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ucd9c\ub825\uc758 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uacfc \uc8fc\uc2dd \uc9c0\uc218\uc640\uc758 \ub0ae\uc740 \uc0c1\uad00 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \ud45c\uc900 \ud3ec\ud2b8\ud3f4\ub9ac\uc624 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc1c\uacac\uc740 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc2e4\uc81c \uac70\ub798 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud560 \ub54c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uad6c\uc870 \ubc0f \uc791\uc5c5 \uad6c\uc131 \uc124\uacc4\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}
