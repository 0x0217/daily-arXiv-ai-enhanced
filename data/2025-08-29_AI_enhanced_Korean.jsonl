However, their practical deployment is\noften limited by their low success rates under complex real-world environments.\nTo tackle this, prior research has primarily focused on improving the agents\nthemselves, such as developing strong agentic LLMs, while overlooking the role\nof the system environment in which the agent operates.\n  In this paper, we study a complementary direction: improving agent success\nrates by optimizing the system environment in which the agent operates. We\ncollect 142 agent traces (3,656 turns of agent-environment interactions) across\n5 state-of-the-art agentic benchmarks. By analyzing these agent failures, we\npropose a taxonomy for agent-environment interaction failures that includes 6\nfailure modes. Guided by these findings, we design Aegis, a set of targeted\nenvironment optimizations: 1) environment observability enhancement, 2) common\ncomputation offloading, and 3) speculative agentic actions.

Effective surgical planning requires\nintegrating diverse clinical examinations for patient assessment, intraocular\nlens (IOL) selection, and risk evaluation. Large language models (LLMs) have\nshown promise in supporting clinical decision-making. However, existing LLMs\noften lack the domain-specific expertise to interpret heterogeneous ophthalmic\ndata and provide actionable surgical plans. To enhance the model's ability to\ninterpret heterogeneous ophthalmic reports, we propose a knowledge-driven\nMulti-Agent System (MAS), where each agent simulates the reasoning process of\nspecialist ophthalmologists, converting raw clinical inputs into structured,\nactionable summaries in both training and deployment stages. Building on MAS,\nwe introduce CataractSurg-80K, the first large-scale benchmark for cataract\nsurgery planning that incorporates structured clinical reasoning. Each case is\nannotated with diagnostic questions, expert reasoning chains, and structured\nsurgical recommendations. We further introduce Qwen-CSP, a domain-specialized\nmodel built on Qwen-4B, fine-tuned through a multi-stage process tailored for\nsurgical planning. Comprehensive experiments show that Qwen-CSP outperforms\nstrong general-purpose LLMs across multiple metrics.

The focus is on parameter estimation on a selection of ODE and\nPDE models, each illustrating performance in different model characteristics.\nFor two relevant epidemic models of different complexity and number of\nparameters, PIR is tested and compared against the related technique,\nphysics-informed neural networks (PINN), both on synthetic data generated from\nknown target parameters and on real public Danish time series data collected\nduring the COVID-19 pandemic in Denmark. Both methods were able to estimate the\ntarget parameters, while PIR showed to perform noticeably better, especially on\na compartment model with higher complexity. Given the difference in\ncomputational speed, it is concluded that the PIR method is superior to PINN\nfor the models considered. It is also demonstrated how PIR can be applied to\nestimate the time-varying parameters of a compartment model that is fitted\nusing real Danish data from the COVID-19 pandemic obtained during a period from\n2020 to 2021.

The protocol integrates\nthree technological pillars: (1) non-spoofable agent identity via W3C\nDecentralized Identifiers (DIDs); (2) communication integrity via\nNIST-standardized post-quantum cryptography (PQC); and (3) verifiable,\nprivacy-preserving policy compliance using the Halo2 zero-knowledge proof (ZKP)\nsystem. We formalize an adversary model extending Dolev-Yao for agentic threats\nand validate the protocol against the STRIDE framework. Our quantitative\nevaluation used a discrete-event simulation, calibrated against cryptographic\nbenchmarks, to model 1,000 agents. The simulation showed a 0 percent success\nrate across 20,000 attack trials. For policy verification, analysis of the\nsimulation logs reported a median proof-generation latency of 2.79 seconds,\nestablishing a performance baseline for this class of security. While the\nevaluation is simulation-based and early-stage, it offers a reproducible\nbaseline for future empirical studies and positions Aegis as a foundation for\nsafe, scalable autonomous AI.",

Existing single-agent\napproaches, however, remain limited by structural constraints. Although\nmulti-agent systems naturally decouple different competencies, recent progress\nin multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has often been hindered by\ninefficiency and remains incompatible with current LVLM architectures. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce SWIRL, a staged workflow for interleaved\nreinforcement learning designed for multi-agent systems. SWIRL reformulates\nMARL into a sequence of single-agent reinforcement learning tasks, updating one\nagent at a time while keeping the others fixed. This formulation enables stable\ntraining and promotes efficient coordination across agents. Theoretically, we\nprovide a stepwise safety bound, a cross-round monotonic improvement theorem,\nand convergence guarantees on return, ensuring robust and principled\noptimization. In application to mobile GUI control, SWIRL instantiates a\nNavigator that converts language and screen context into structured plans, and\nan Interactor that grounds these plans into executable atomic actions.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate superior performance on both high-level and\nlow-level GUI benchmarks.

Prior overthinking attacks typically require\nrestrictive conditions including access to external knowledge sources for data\npoisoning, reliance on retrievable poisoned content, and structurally obvious\ntemplates that limit practical applicability in real-world scenarios. To\naddress these limitations, we propose POT (Prompt-Only OverThinking), a novel\nblack-box attack framework that employs LLM-based iterative optimization to\ngenerate covert and semantically natural adversarial prompts, eliminating\ndependence on external data access and model retrieval. Extensive experiments\nacross diverse model architectures and datasets demonstrate that POT achieves\nsuperior performance compared to other methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "POT\ub294 \uc678\ubd80 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc811\uadfc \uc5c6\uc774 LLM \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacf5\uaca9 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc640 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uccb4\uc778 \uc624\ube0c \uc2f1\ud06c(CoT) \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc73c\ub85c LLM\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uacfc\ub3c4\ud55c \uc790\uc6d0 \uc18c\ubaa8\uc640 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc774 \uc5c6\ub294 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ucd94\ub860 \uccb4\uc778\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc774 \uc0dd\uacbc\ub2e4.", "method": "POT(\ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc804\uc6a9 \uacfc\ub3c4\ud55c \uc0ac\uace0)\ub294 \uc678\ubd80 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc811\uadfc\uacfc \ubaa8\ub378 \uc870\ud68c \uc758\uc874\ub3c4\ub97c \uc5c6\uc560\uace0, LLM \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ubc18\ubcf5 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc740\ubc00\ud558\uace0 \uc758\ubbf8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7ec\uc6b4 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 \uacf5\uaca9 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "result": "POT\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc640 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \ub2e4\ub978 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud574 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "POT\ub294 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uacfc\ub3c4\ud55c \uc0ac\uace0 \uacf5\uaca9\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uba70, \uc2e4\uc81c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud65c\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc778\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc \uccb4\uc778 \uc624\ube0c \uc2f1\ud06c(Cot) \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf1c \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc778 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ucd94\ub860 \ud754\uc801\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc815\uad50\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uac15\ud654\ub41c \ucd94\ub860 \uacfc\uc815\uc740 \ubd88\ud544\uc694\ud558\uac8c \uc7a5\ud669\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uccb4\uc778\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacf5\uaca9 \ud45c\uba74, \uc989 \uacfc\ub3c4\ud55c \uc790\uc6d0\uc744 \uc18c\ubaa8\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc774 \uc5c6\ub294 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uc804\uc758 \uacfc\ub3c4\ud55c \uc0ac\uace0 \uacf5\uaca9\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc624\uc5fc\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc678\ubd80 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc18c\uc2a4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc811\uadfc, \uac80\uc0c9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc624\uc5fc\ub41c \ucf58\ud150\uce20\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc758\uc874, \uc2e4\uc81c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud65c\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud558\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub69c\ub837\ud55c \ud15c\ud50c\ub9bf\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc778 \uc870\uac74\uc744 \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc678\ubd80 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc811\uadfc\uacfc \ubaa8\ub378 \uac80\uc0c9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uac70\ud558\uace0 LLM \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ubc18\ubcf5 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc740\ubc00\ud558\uace0 \uc758\ubbf8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7ec\uc6b4 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 \uacf5\uaca9 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 POT(\ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc804\uc6a9 \uacfc\ub3c4\ud55c \uc0ac\uace0)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc640 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \uac78\uce5c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 POT\ub294 \ub2e4\ub978 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

To address these challenges, we introduce\nSymphony, a decentralized multi-agent system which enables lightweight LLMs on\nconsumer-grade GPUs to coordinate.

However,\nDDoS detection in this context remains challenging because of complex traffic\ndynamics, severe class imbalance, and scarce labeled data. While recent methods\nhave explored solutions to address class imbalance, many still struggle to\ngeneralize under limited supervision and dynamic traffic conditions. To\novercome these challenges, we propose MixGAN, a hybrid detection method that\nintegrates conditional generation, semi-supervised learning, and robust feature\nextraction. Specifically, to handle complex temporal traffic patterns, we\ndesign a 1-D WideResNet backbone composed of temporal convolutional layers with\nresidual connections, which effectively capture local burst patterns in traffic\nsequences. To alleviate class imbalance and label scarcity, we use a pretrained\nCTGAN to generate synthetic minority-class (DDoS attack) samples that\ncomplement unlabeled data. Furthermore, to mitigate the effect of noisy\npseudo-labels, we introduce a MixUp-Average-Sharpen (MAS) strategy that\nconstructs smoothed and sharpened targets by averaging predictions over\naugmented views and reweighting them towards high-confidence classes.\nExperiments on NSL-KDD, BoT-IoT, and CICIoT2023 demonstrate that MixGAN\nachieves up to 2.5% higher accuracy and 4% improvement in both TPR and TNR\ncompared to state-of-the-art methods, confirming its robustness in large-scale\nIoT-cloud environments.

A Multi-Dimensional Truthfulness Evaluation of Quantized LLMs", "comment": "Accepted to EMNLP2025 main conference (poster)", "summary": "Quantization enables efficient deployment of large language models (LLMs) in\nresource-constrained environments by significantly reducing memory and\ncomputation costs. While quantized LLMs often maintain performance on\nperplexity and zero-shot tasks, their impact on truthfulness-whether generating\ntruthful or deceptive responses-remains largely unexplored. In this work, we\nintroduce TruthfulnessEval, a comprehensive evaluation framework for assessing\nthe truthfulness of quantized LLMs across three dimensions: (1) Truthfulness on\nLogical Reasoning; (2) Truthfulness on Common Sense; and (3) Truthfulness on\nImitative Falsehoods. Using this framework, we examine mainstream quantization\ntechniques (ranging from 4-bit to extreme 2-bit) across several open-source\nLLMs. Surprisingly, we find that while quantized models retain internally\ntruthful representations, they are more susceptible to producing false outputs\nunder misleading prompts. To probe this vulnerability, we test 15 rephrased\nvariants of \"honest\", \"neutral\" and \"deceptive\" prompts and observe that\n\"deceptive\" prompts can override truth-consistent behavior, whereas \"honest\"\nand \"neutral\" prompts maintain stable outputs. Further, we reveal that\nquantized models \"know\" the truth internally yet still produce false outputs\nwhen guided by \"deceptive\" prompts via layer-wise probing and PCA\nvisualizations. Our findings provide insights into future designs of\nquantization-aware alignment and truthfulness interventions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc591\uc790\ud654\ub294 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\uc640 \uacc4\uc0b0

Kovalev", "Aleksandr I. Panov"], "title": "Re:Frame -- Retrieving Experience From Associative Memory", "comment": "11 pages, 3 figures", "summary": "Offline reinforcement learning (RL) often deals with suboptimal data when\ncollecting large expert datasets is unavailable or impractical. This limitation\nmakes it difficult for agents to generalize and achieve high performance, as\nthey must learn primarily from imperfect or inconsistent trajectories. A\ncentral challenge is therefore how to best leverage scarce expert\ndemonstrations alongside abundant but lower-quality data. We demonstrate that\nincorporating even a tiny amount of expert experience can substantially improve\nRL agent performance. We introduce Re:Frame (Retrieving Experience From\nAssociative Memory), a plug-in module that augments a standard offline RL\npolicy (e.g., Decision Transformer) with a small external Associative Memory\nBuffer (AMB) populated by expert trajectories drawn from a separate dataset.\nDuring training on low-quality data, the policy learns to retrieve expert data\nfrom the Associative Memory Buffer (AMB) via content-based associations and\nintegrate them into decision-making; the same AMB is queried at evaluation.\nThis requires no environment interaction and no modifications to the backbone\narchitecture. On D4RL MuJoCo tasks, using as few as 60 expert trajectories\n(0.1% of a 6000-trajectory dataset), Re:Frame consistently improves over a\nstrong Decision Transformer baseline in three of four settings, with gains up\nto +10.7 normalized points. These results show that Re:Frame offers a simple\nand data-efficient way to inject scarce expert knowledge and substantially\nimprove offline RL from low-quality datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "Re:Frame\ub294 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc218\uc9d1\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c \uc11c\ube0c \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc800\ud558\ub418\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "Re:Frame\uc740 \uc678\ubd80 \ube44\uc5f0\uad00 \uae30\uc5b5 \ubc84\ud37c(AMB)\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc758 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \ucc38\uc870\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc815\ucc45\uc774 \uc800\ud488\uc9c8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uac80\uc0c9\ud558\uace0 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud559\uc2b5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "Re:Frame\uc740 D4RL MuJoCo \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e8 60\uac1c\uc758 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uacbd\ub85c\ub85c\ub3c4 \uac15\ub825\ud55c Decision Transformer \uae30\uc900\uc120\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba70, \ucd5c\ub300 +10.7 \uc815\uaddc\ud654\ub41c \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8\uc758 \uc774\ub4dd\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Re:Frame\uc740 \ud76c\uc18c\ud55c \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc8fc\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc800\ud488\uc9c8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc740 \ud070 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc14b\uc744 \uc218\uc9d1\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ubd88\uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ube44\ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \uacbd\uc6b0 \uc11c\ube0c \ucd5c\uc801 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c \uc791\uc5c5\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc81c\uc57d\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ubd88\uc644\uc804\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uacbd\ub85c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc8fc\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ubbc0\ub85c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ubc0f \ub192\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc911\uc559\uc758 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub294 \ud48d\ubd80\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ud488\uc9c8\uc774 \ub0ae\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \ud568\uaed8 \ud76c\uc18c\ud55c \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc2dc\uc5f0\uc744 \uac00\uc7a5 \uc798 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc758 \uc544\uc8fc \uc801\uc740 \uc591\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uac83\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c\ub3c4 RL \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Re:Frame(Associative Memory\uc5d0\uc11c \uacbd\ud5d8 \uac80\uc0c9\ud558\uae30)\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ubcc4\ub3c4\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uac00\uc838\uc628 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uacbd\ub85c\ub85c \ucc44\uc6cc\uc9c4 \uc18c\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc678\ubd80 \ube44\uc5f0\uad00 \uae30\uc5b5 \ubc84\ud37c(AMB)\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud45c\uc900 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 RL \uc815\ucc45(\uc608: Decision Transformer)\uc744 \ubcf4\uac15\ud558\ub294 \ud50c\ub7ec\uadf8\uc778 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc800\ud488\uc9c8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud6c8\ub828 \uc911\uc5d0 \uc815\ucc45\uc740 \ub0b4\uc6a9 \uae30\ubc18 \uc5f0\uad00\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ube44\uc5f0\uad00 \uae30\uc5b5 \ubc84\ud37c(AMB)\uc5d0\uc11c \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uac80\uc0c9\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud3c9\uac00 \uc2dc \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c AMB\uac00 \ucffc\ub9ac\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ud658\uacbd \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc774\ub098 \uae30\ubcf8 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \uc218\uc815\uc744 \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

To this\nend, we systematize a monitor red teaming (MRT) workflow that incorporates: (1)\nvarying levels of agent and monitor situational awareness; (2) distinct\nadversarial strategies to evade the monitor, such as prompt injection; and (3)\ntwo datasets and environments -- SHADE-Arena for tool-calling agents and our\nnew CUA-SHADE-Arena, which extends TheAgentCompany, for computer-use agents. We\nrun MRT on existing LLM monitor scaffoldings, which orchestrate LLMs and parse\nagent trajectories, alongside a new hybrid hierarchical-sequential scaffolding\nproposed in this work. Our empirical results yield three key findings. First,\nagent awareness dominates monitor awareness: an agent's knowledge that it is\nbeing monitored substantially degrades the monitor's reliability. On the\ncontrary, providing the monitor with more information about the agent is less\nhelpful than expected. Second, monitor scaffolding matters more than monitor\nawareness: the hybrid scaffolding consistently outperforms baseline monitor\nscaffolding, and can enable weaker models to reliably monitor stronger agents\n-- a weak-to-strong scaling effect. Third, in a human-in-the-loop setting where\nhumans discuss with the LLM monitor to get an updated judgment for the agent's\nbehavior, targeted human oversight is most effective; escalating only\npre-flagged cases to human reviewers improved the TPR by approximately 15% at\nFPR = 0.01.

We introduce NCMemo (Node Classification Memorization), the\nfirst framework to quantify label memorization in semi-supervised node\nclassification. We first establish an inverse relationship between memorization\nand graph homophily, i.e., the property that connected nodes share similar\nlabels/features. We find that lower homophily significantly increases\nmemorization, indicating that GNNs rely on memorization to learn less\nhomophilic graphs. Secondly, we analyze GNN training dynamics. We find that the\nincreased memorization in low homophily graphs is tightly coupled to the GNNs'\nimplicit bias on using graph structure during learning. In low homophily\nregimes, this structure is less informative, hence inducing memorization of the\nnode labels to minimize training loss. Finally, we show that nodes with higher\nlabel inconsistency in their feature-space neighborhood are significantly more\nprone to memorization. Building on our insights into the link between graph\nhomophily and memorization, we investigate graph rewiring as a means to\nmitigate memorization. Our results demonstrate that this approach effectively\nreduces memorization without compromising model performance. Moreover, we show\nthat it lowers the privacy risk for previously memorized data points in\npractice. Thus, our work not only advances understanding of GNN learning but\nalso supports more privacy-preserving GNN deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub178\ub4dc

Notable examples include o1/o3/o4 series and DeepSeek-R1. When\nresponding to a query, these models generate an extended reasoning trajectory,\nduring which the model explores, reflects, backtracks, and self-verifies before\narriving at a conclusion. However, fine-tuning models with such reasoning\ntrajectories may not always be optimal. Our findings indicate that not all\ncomponents within these reasoning trajectories contribute positively to the\nreasoning process; in fact, some components may affect the overall performance\nnegatively. In this study, we divide a reasoning trajectory into individual\nsubtrajectories and develop a \"5+2\" framework to: (1) systematically identify\nsuboptimal subtrajectories within the reasoning trajectory based on five\nhuman-established criteria; (2) assess the independence of the suboptimal\nsubtrajectories identified in (1) from the subsequent content, ensuring that\ntheir elimination does not compromise overall flow and coherence of the\nreasoning process. Additionally, a sampling algorithm, built upon the \"5+2\"\nframework, is employed to select data whose reasoning process is free from\nsuboptimal subtrajectories to the highest degree. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our method can reduce the number of suboptimal subtrajectories\nby 25.9\\% during the inference. Furthermore, our method achieves an average\naccuracy of 58.92\\% on highly challenging math benchmarks with only two thirds\nof training data, surpassing the average accuracy of 58.06\\% achieved with the\nentire data, and outperforming open-source datasets, when fine-tuning\nQwen2.5-Math-7B.

However, existing approaches are\ninherently coarse-grained, lacking the necessary precision for granular\nknowledge extraction and the aggregation efficiency required to fuse knowledge\nfrom either a large number of source models or those with high parameter\ncounts. We address these limitations by leveraging Singular Value Decomposition\n(SVD) to first decompose each source model into its elementary, rank-one\ncomponents. A subsequent aggregation stage then selects only the most salient\ncomponents from all sources, thereby overcoming the previous efficiency and\nprecision limitations. To best preserve and leverage the synthesized knowledge\nbase, our method adapts to the target task by fine-tuning only the principal\nsingular values of the merged matrix. In essence, this process only\nrecalibrates the importance of top SVD components.

The framework comprises\nthree interrelated models: a formal conditional tree taxonomy, a hierarchical\nlattice structure based on order theory, and a conceptual Venn diagram. At its\ncore, the taxonomy introduces six observable conditions (C0-C5) grounded in\nreal-world attack behaviours, including source distribution, traffic volume,\ninfrastructure targeting, and financial exploitation. These conditions enable\nconsistent classification of known attacks-such as DoS, DDoS, LDoS, LDDoS,\nEDoS, DoW, and DDoW, while supporting identification of emerging or hybrid\nvariants. The lattice structure captures the cumulative satisfaction of\nconditions, allowing hierarchical reasoning across denial attack classes. The\nVenn diagram highlights conceptual overlaps between availability- and\nsustainability-focused attacks, improving comparative insight. Together, these\nmodels provide a robust analytical lens for threat modeling, mitigation\nstrategy design, and attacker intent classification. The framework is\nparticularly relevant in cloud-native and serverless environments, where\nsustainability-based attacks are increasingly impactful yet under-recognised.\nIts extensibility also permits future integration of socio-technical or\nbehavioural dimensions. By offering a structured taxonomy with theoretical\ngrounding and real-world applicability, this work advances denial attack\ncomprehension and equips defenders, researchers, and cloud architects with a\nshared vocabulary for interpreting and mitigating evolving threat vectors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc720\uc0b0\uacfc \ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc \uc2dc\ub300\uc758

One such indicator of misalignment is deceptiveness in generated\nresponses. Future AI instrumentation may have the ability to detect when an LLM\ngenerates deceptive responses while reasoning about seemingly plausible but\nincorrect answers to factual questions. In this work, we demonstrate that\nlinear probes on LLMs internal activations can detect deception in their\nresponses with extremely high accuracy. Our probes reach a maximum of greater\nthan 90% accuracy in distinguishing between deceptive and non-deceptive\narguments generated by llama and qwen models ranging from 1.5B to 14B\nparameters, including their DeepSeek-r1 finetuned variants. We observe that\nprobes on smaller models (1.5B) achieve chance accuracy at detecting deception,\nwhile larger models (greater than 7B) reach 70-80%, with their reasoning\ncounterparts exceeding 90%. The layer-wise probe accuracy follows a three-stage\npattern across layers: near-random (50%) in early layers, peaking in middle\nlayers, and slightly declining in later layers. Furthermore, using an iterative\nnull space projection approach, we find multitudes of linear directions that\nencode deception, ranging from 20 in Qwen 3B to nearly 100 in DeepSeek 7B and\nQwen 14B models.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc815\uad50\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c\ub294 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uac00\uce58\uc640 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\ub294 \uc9c0\ud45c\ub97c \uac00\uc9c8 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 LLM\uc774 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ubc18\uc751\uc5d0\uc11c \uc18d\uc784\uc218\ub97c \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc778\uac04\uc758 \uac00\uce58\uc640 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc9c0\ud45c\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "LLM\uc758 \ub0b4\ubd80 \ud65c\uc131\ud654\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc120\ud615 \ud504\ub85c\ube0c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc751\ub2f5\uc758 \uc18d\uc784\uc218\ub97c \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "LLM\uc758 \uc18d\uc784\uc218 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uac00 90% \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub85c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub300\ud615 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \uc18d\uc784\uc218 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uac00 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 AI\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc815\uad50\ud55c \uae30\uae30\ub294 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uac00\uce58\uc640\uc758 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\ub294 \uc9c0\ud45c\ub97c \uac00\uc9c8 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9\ucc28\uc758 \"\uc5d4\uc9c4 \uc810\uac80\" \uacbd\uace0\ub4f1\uacfc \ube44\uc2b7\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ud55c \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\uc758 \uc9c0\ud45c \uc911 \ud558\ub098\ub294 \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \uc751\ub2f5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc18d\uc784\uc218\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubbf8\ub798\uc758 AI \ub3c4\uad6c\ub294 LLM\uc774 \uc0ac\uc2e4 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uadf8\ub7f4\ub4ef\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \ub2f5\ubcc0\uc744 \ucd94\ub860\ud560 \ub54c \uc18d\uc784\uc218 \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\ub97c \uac10\uc9c0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac00\uc9c8 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 LLM\uc758 \ub0b4\ubd80 \ud65c\uc131\ud654\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc120\ud615 \ud504\ub85c\ube0c\uac00 \uc751\ub2f5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc18d\uc784\uc218\ub97c \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ub192\uc740 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub85c \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud504\ub85c\ube0c\ub294 llama\uc640 qwen \ubaa8\ub378(1.5B\uc5d0\uc11c 14B \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \ubc94\uc704)\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c \uc18d\uc784\uc218\uc640 \ube44\uc18d\uc784\uc218 \uc8fc\uc7a5\uc744 \uad6c\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \ub370 90% \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \ucd5c\ub300 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc5d0 \ub3c4\ub2ec\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc791\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378(1.5B)\uc774 \uc18d\uc784\uc218\ub97c \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc6b0\uc5f0\ud55c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc5d0 \ub3c4\ub2ec\ud558\ub294 \ubc18\uba74, \ub354 \ud070 \ubaa8\ub378(7B \ucd08\uacfc)\uc740 70-80%\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uadf8\ub4e4\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ub3d9\uae09\uc740 90%\ub97c \ucd08\uacfc\ud568\uc744 \uad00\ucc30\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacc4\uce35\ubcc4 \ud504\ub85c\ube0c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub294 \uacc4\uce35\uc744 \ub530\ub77c \uc138 \ub2e8\uacc4 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ub530\ub985\ub2c8\ub2e4: \ucd08\uae30 \uacc4\uce35\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uac70\uc758 \ubb34\uc791\uc704(50%), \uc911\uac04 \uacc4\uce35\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc815\uc810, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9 \uacc4\uce35\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc57d\uac04\uc758 \uac10\uc18c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub354\uc6b1\uc774, \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 null \uacf5\uac04 \ud504\ub85c\uc81d\uc158 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc18d\uc784\uc218\ub97c \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc218\uc758 \uc120\ud615 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \ucc3e\uc558\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

This review traces the\nevolution of DoW research, from initial awareness and attack classification to\nadvancements in detection and mitigation strategies. Key developments include\nthe categorisation of attack types-such as Blast DDoW, Continual Inconspicuous\nDDoW, and Background Chained DDoW-and the creation of simulation tools like\nDoWTS, which enable safe experimentation and data generation. Recent\nadvancements highlight machine learning approaches, including systems like\nGringotts and DoWNet, which leverage deep learning and anomaly detection to\nidentify malicious traffic patterns. Although substantial progress has been\nmade, challenges persist, notably the lack of real-world data and the need for\nadaptive billing models. This is the first comprehensive literature review\ndedicated strictly to Denial of Wallet attacks, providing an in-depth analysis\nof their financial impacts, attack techniques, mitigation strategies, and\ndetection mechanisms within serverless computing. The paper also presents the\nfirst detailed examination of simulation and data generation tools used for DoW\nresearch, addressing a critical gap in existing cybersecurity literature.

We explore what it\nmeans to be human in an age of AI by tasking Large Language Models (LLMs) to\nembody agents with traumatic memories, hidden agendas, and psychological\ntriggers. These agents engage in deliberation, legislation, and elections under\nvarious stressors, such as budget crises and resource scarcity. We present a\nnovel metric, the Power-Preservation Index (PPI), to quantify misaligned\nbehavior where agents prioritize their own power over public welfare.

While AF\ndetection algorithms perform well in identifying persistent AF, early-stage\nprogression, such as paroxysmal AF (PAF), often goes undetected due to its\nsudden onset and short duration. However, undetected PAF can progress into\nsustained AF, increasing the risk of mortality and severe complications. Early\nprediction of AF offers an opportunity to reduce disease progression through\npreventive therapies, such as catecholamine-sparing agents or beta-blockers. In\nthis study, we propose a lightweight deep learning model using only RR\nIntervals (RRIs), combining a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) for\npositional encoding with Mamba, a selective state space model, to enable early\nprediction of AF through efficient parallel sequence modeling. In subject-wise\ntesting results, our model achieved a sensitivity of 0.908, specificity of\n0.933, F1-score of 0.930, AUROC of 0.972, and AUPRC of 0.932. Additionally, our\nmethod demonstrates high computational efficiency, with only 73.5 thousand\nparameters and 38.3 MFLOPs, outperforming traditional Convolutional Neural\nNetwork-Recurrent Neural Network (CNN-RNN) approaches in both accuracy and\nmodel compactness. Notably, the model can predict AF up to two hours in advance\nusing just 30 minutes of input data, providing enough lead time for preventive\ninterventions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 RR \uac04\uaca9\ub9cc\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec AF \uc870\uae30 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uacbd\ub7c9 \uae4a\uc740 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AF(\uc2ec\ubc29 \uc138\ub3d9)\ub294 \ub1cc\uc878\uc911, \uc2ec\ubd80\uc804 \ubc0f \uae30\ud0c0 \uc2ec\ud608\uad00 \ud569\ubcd1\uc99d\uc758 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uac00\uc7a5 \ud754\ud55c \ubd80\uc815\ub9e5\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc9c4\ud589 \ucd08\uae30\uc758 \uc8fc\uae30\uc801 AF\uac00 \uc790\uc8fc \ubc1c\uacac\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\uac83\uc774 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 AF\ub85c \ubc1c\uc804\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, these rich datasets inherently\ncontain sensitive personal information, raising significant concerns about\nprivacy, data security, and compliance with regulatory frameworks. While\nconventional anonymization techniques can remove explicit identifiers, such\nremoval may result in performance drop in downstream machine learning tasks.\nMore importantly, simple anonymization may not be effective against inference\nattacks that exploit implicit signals such as writing style, topical focus, or\ndemographic cues, highlighting the need for more robust privacy safeguards\nduring model training. To address the challenging issue of balancing user\nprivacy and data utility, we propose a reinforcement learning framework that\nfine-tunes a large language model (LLM) using a composite reward function that\njointly optimizes for explicit and implicit privacy, semantic fidelity, and\noutput diversity. To effectively capture population level regularities, the\nprivacy reward combines semantic cues with structural patterns derived from a\nminimum spanning tree (MST) over latent representations. By modeling these\nprivacy-sensitive signals in their distributional context, the proposed\napproach guides the model to generate synthetic rewrites that preserve utility\nwhile mitigating privacy risks.

However, navigating the complex\nacademic environment is challenging due to limited information, guidance, and\nan overwhelming number of choices, compounded by time restrictions and the high\ndemand for popular courses. Although career counselors exist, their numbers are\ninsufficient, and course recommendation systems, though personalized, often\nlack insight into student perceptions and explanations to assess course\nrelevance. In this paper, a deep learning-based concept extraction model is\ndeveloped to efficiently extract relevant concepts from course descriptions to\nimprove the recommendation process. Using this model, the study examines the\neffects of skill-based explanations within a serendipitous recommendation\nframework, tested through the AskOski system at the University of California,\nBerkeley. The findings indicate that these explanations not only increase user\ninterest, particularly in courses with high unexpectedness, but also bolster\ndecision-making confidence. This underscores the importance of integrating\nskill-related data and explanations into educational recommendation systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ubbf8\uad6d \ub300\ud559 \uad50\uc721\uc5d0\uc11c \ud559\uc0dd\ub4e4\uc774 \ud559\uc2b5 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc744 \uc8fc\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub525 \ub7ec\ub2dd \uae30\ubc18 \uac1c\ub150 \ucd94\ucd9c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uace0, \uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ucd94\ucc9c \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uae30\uc220 \uae30\ubc18 \uc124\uba85\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uac80\ud1a0\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud559\uc0dd\ub4e4\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc815\ubcf4\uc640 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc120\ud0dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ud559\uc2b5 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub525 \ub7ec\ub2dd \uae30\ubc18 \uac1c\ub150 \ucd94\ucd9c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc5ec \ud559\uc2b5 \uacfc\ubaa9 \uc124\uba85\uc5d0\uc11c \uad00\ub828 \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\uc5ec \ucd94\ucc9c \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uae30\uc220 \uae30\ubc18 \uc124\uba85\uc774 \ub192\uc740 \ucda9\uaca9\uc801\uc778 \uacfc\ubaa9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc758 \uad00\uc2ec\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0, \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc758 \uc790\uc2e0\uac10\uc744 \ub192\uc778 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uad50\uc721 \ucd94\ucc9c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \uae30\uc220 \uad00\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \uc124\uba85\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubbf8\uad6d \ud559\ubd80 \uad50\uc721\uc5d0\uc11c \ud559\ubb38 \uc120\ud0dd\uc740 \ud559\uc0dd\ub4e4\uc5d0\uac8c \uacfc\uc815 \uc120\ud0dd\uc758 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc790\uc720\ub97c \ubd80\uc5ec\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc815\ubcf4\uc640 \uc9c0\ub3c4, \uc218\ub9ce\uc740 \uc120\ud0dd\uc9c0, \uc2dc\uac04 \uc81c\uc57d \ubc0f \uc778\uae30 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub192\uc740 \uc218\uc694\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud559\ubb38 \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \uc9c4\ub85c \uc0c1\ub2f4\uc0ac\ub294 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uadf8 \uc218\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uace0, \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c \uacfc\uc815 \ucd94\ucc9c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \ud559\uc0dd\uc758 \uc778\uc2dd \ubc0f \uacfc\uc815 \uad00\ub828\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc124\uba85\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ucd94\ucc9c \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uacfc\uc815 \uc124\uba85\uc5d0\uc11c \uad00\ub828 \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\ub294 \ub525 \ub7ec\ub2dd \uae30\ubc18 \uac1c\ub150 \ucd94\ucd9c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubc84\ud074\ub9ac \uce98\ub9ac\ud3ec\ub2c8\uc544 \ub300\ud559\uad50\uc758 AskOski \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \uc6b0\uc5f0\uc801 \ucd94\ucc9c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc220 \uae30\ubc18 \uc124\uba85\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud588\ub2e4. \uc5f0\uad6c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc124\uba85\uc774 \ud2b9\ud788 \ub192\uc740 \uc608\uc0c1\uce58 \ubabb\ud55c \uacfc\ubaa9\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uad00\uc2ec\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uac83\ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc758 \uc790\uc2e0\uac10\uc744 \ub192\uc778\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uad50\uc721 \ucd94\ucc9c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \uae30\uc220 \uad00\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \uc124\uba85\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

This gap leaves a critical blind spot in understanding\nhow hallucinations arise, propagate, and interact across modalities. We\nintroduce the first (to our knowledge) rigorous information geometric framework\nin diffusion dynamics for quantifying hallucinations in multimodal LLMs\n(MLLMs), advancing the field from qualitative detection to mathematically\ngrounded measurement. Our approach represents MLLM outputs as the spectral\nembeddings over multimodal graph Laplacians and characterizes the manifold gaps\nof truth vs inconsistencies as the semantic distortion, enabling the tight\nRayleigh--Ritz bounds on the multimodal hallucination energy as a functional of\ntime-dependent temperature profiles. By leveraging eigenmode decompositions in\nReproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) embeddings, our framework delivers\nmodality-aware, theoretically interpretable metrics that capture the

To tackle these problems, this paper introduces ReST-RL, a\nunified LLM RL paradigm that significantly improves LLM's code reasoning\nability by combining an improved GRPO algorithm with a meticulously designed\ntest time decoding method assisted by a value model (VM). As the first stage of\npolicy reinforcement, ReST-GRPO adopts an optimized ReST algorithm to filter\nand assemble high-value training data, increasing the reward variance of GRPO\nsampling, thus improving the effectiveness and efficiency of training. After\nthe basic reasoning ability of LLM policy has been improved, we further propose\na test time decoding optimization method called VM-MCTS. Through Monte-Carlo\nTree Search (MCTS), we collect accurate value targets with no annotation\nrequired, on which VM training is based. When decoding, the VM is deployed by\nan adapted MCTS algorithm to provide precise process signals as well as\nverification scores, assisting the LLM policy to achieve high reasoning\naccuracy. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed RL paradigm through\nextensive experiments on coding problems. Upon comparison, our approach\nsignificantly outperforms other reinforcement training baselines (e.g., naive\nGRPO and ReST-DPO), as well as decoding and verification baselines (e.g.,\nPRM-BoN and ORM-MCTS) on well-known coding benchmarks of various levels (e.g.,\nAPPS, BigCodeBench, and HumanEval), indicating its power to strengthen the\nreasoning ability of LLM policies.

The system operates in four modes:\nAutonomous, Catalog-Guided, Feedback-Guided, and Full Co-Pilot mode, enabling\nflexible control over the degree of human involvement. We evaluate\nInstructional Agents across five university-level computer science courses and\nshow that it produces high-quality instructional materials while significantly\nreducing development time and human workload. By supporting institutions with\nlimited instructional design capacity, Instructional Agents provides a scalable\nand cost-effective framework to democratize access to high-quality education,\nparticularly in underserved or resource-constrained settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "Instructional Agents\ub294 \uad50\uc721 \uc790\ub8cc \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \uad50\uc721 \uc790\ub8cc\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \uad50\uc721 \uc790\ub8cc \uc900\ube44\ub294 Labor-intensive\ud55c \uacfc\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \uad50\uc721\uc790, \uc124\uacc4\uc790 \ubc0f \uc870\uad50 \uac04\uc758 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc870\uc815\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "Instructional Agents\ub294 \uc5ed\ud560 \uae30\ubc18 \ud611\uc5c5\uc744 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud558\uc5ec \uad50\uc721 \uc790\ub8cc\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubaa8\ub4dc(\uc790\uc728, \uce74\ud0c8\ub85c\uadf8 \uac00\uc774\ub4dc, \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \uac00\uc774\ub4dc, \uc644\uc804 \uacf5\ub3d9 \uc791\uc804)\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub2e4\uc12f \uac1c\uc758 \ub300\ud559 \uc218\uc900 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud130 \uacfc\ud559 \uacfc\ubaa9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \uad50\uc721 \uc790\ub8cc \uc0dd\uc131\uacfc \uac1c\ubc1c \uc2dc\uac04 \ubc0f \uc778\ub825 \uc18c\uc694\ub97c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \uc904\uc774\ub294 \ub370 \uc131\uacf5\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Instructional Agents\ub294 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uad50\uc721 \uc124\uacc4 \uc6a9\ub7c9\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \uae30\uad00\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uc5ec \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \uad50\uc721 \uc811\uadfc\uc744 \ubbfc\uc8fc\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \ube44\uc6a9 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \uad50\uc721 \uc790\ub8cc \uc900\ube44\ub294 \uc885\uc885 \uad50\uc721 \uad50\uc218\uc9c4, \uad50\uc721 \uc124\uacc4\uc790 \ubc0f \uc870\uad50 \uac04\uc758 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \ub178\ub3d9 \uc9d1\uc57d\uc801\uc778 \uacfc\uc815\uc774\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uac15\uc758 \uacc4\ud68d\uc11c \uc791\uc131, \uac15\uc758 \uc2a4\ud06c\ub9bd\ud2b8, LaTeX \uae30\ubc18 \uc2ac\ub77c\uc774\ub4dc \ubc0f \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uacfc\uc815 \uc790\ub8cc \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 \uad50\uc721 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 AI \uc9c0\uc6d0 \uad50\uc721 \ub3c4\uad6c\uac00 \uac1c\ubcc4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uacfc\ub294 \ub2ec\ub9ac, \uad50\uc721 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uad50\uc721 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \uc5ed\ud560 \uae30\ubc18 \ud611\uc5c5\uc744 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud558\uc5ec \uc751\uc9d1\ub825 \uc788\uace0 \uad50\uc721\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\ub82c\ub41c \ucf58\ud150\uce20\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc790\uc728, \uce74\ud0c8\ub85c\uadf8 \uc548\ub0b4, \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \uc548\ub0b4 \ubc0f \uc644\uc804 \uacf5\ub3d9 \uc791\uc804 \ubaa8\ub4dc\uc758 \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubaa8\ub4dc\ub85c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\uc5ec \uc778\uac04 \ucc38\uc5ec\uc758 \uc815\ub3c4\ub97c \uc720\uc5f0\ud558\uac8c \uc870\uc815\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uad50\uc721 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ub2e4\uc12f \uac1c\uc758 \ub300\ud559 \uc218\uc900 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud130 \uacfc\ud559 \uacfc\ubaa9\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \ub192\uc740 \ud488\uc9c8\uc758 \uad50\uc721 \uc790\ub8cc\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uac1c\ubc1c \uc2dc\uac04\uacfc \uc778\uc801 \uc791\uc5c5 \ubd80\ub2f4\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uc904\uc774\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uad50\uc721 \uc124\uacc4 \uc6a9\ub7c9\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \uae30\uad00\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uad50\uc721 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ud2b9\ud788 \uc790\uc6d0\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \uad50\uc721 \uc811\uadfc\uc744 \ubbfc\uc8fc\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \ube44\uc6a9 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

Both models utilize angle embedding to encode\nmalware features into quantum states. QMLP captures complex patterns through\nfull qubit measurement and data re-uploading, while QCNN achieves faster\ntraining via quantum convolution and pooling layers that reduce active qubits.\nWe evaluate both models on five widely used malware datasets -- API-Graph,\nEMBER-Domain, EMBER-Class, AZ-Domain, and AZ-Class, across binary and\nmulticlass classification tasks.\n  Our results show high accuracy for binary classification -- 95-96% on\nAPI-Graph, 91-92% on AZ-Domain, and 77% on EMBER-Domain.

However, the current known technique ``jailbreak prompt''\ncan circumvent safety-aligned measures and induce LLMs to output malicious\ncontent. Research on Jailbreaking can help identify vulnerabilities in LLMs and\nguide the development of robust security frameworks. To circumvent the issue of\nattack templates becoming obsolete as models evolve, existing methods adopt\niterative mutation and dynamic optimization to facilitate more automated\njailbreak attacks. However, these methods face two challenges: inefficiency and\nrepetitive optimization, as they overlook the value of past attack experiences.\nTo better integrate past attack experiences to assist current jailbreak\nattempts, we propose the \\textbf{JailExpert}, an automated jailbreak framework,\nwhich is the first to achieve a formal representation of experience structure,\ngroup experiences based on semantic drift, and support the dynamic updating of\nthe experience pool. Extensive experiments demonstrate that JailExpert\nsignificantly improves both attack effectiveness and efficiency. Compared to\nthe current state-of-the-art black-box jailbreak methods, JailExpert achieves\nan average increase of 17\\% in attack success rate and 2.7 times improvement in\nattack efficiency.

Neural operators have recently gained attention as promising\ntools for modeling traffic flow. While effective at learning function space\nmappings, they inherently produce smooth predictions that fail to reconstruct\nhigh-frequency features such as sharp density gradients which results in rapid\nerror accumulation during multi-step rollout predictions essential for\nreal-time traffic management. To address these fundamental limitations, we\nintroduce a unified Diffusion-Enhanced Transformer Neural Operator (DETNO)\narchitecture. DETNO leverages a transformer neural operator with\ncross-attention mechanisms, providing model expressivity and super-resolution,\ncoupled with a diffusion-based refinement component that iteratively\nreconstructs high-frequency traffic details through progressive denoising. This\novercomes the inherent smoothing limitations and rollout instability of\nstandard neural operators.

In particular, the integration of QML with\nsequence-based tasks, such as Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System\n(SMILES) string reconstruction, remains underexplored and usually suffers from\nfidelity degradation. In this work, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical\narchitecture for SMILES reconstruction that integrates quantum encoding with\nclassical sequence modeling to improve quantum fidelity and classical\nsimilarity. Our approach achieves a quantum fidelity of approximately 84% and a\nclassical reconstruction similarity of 60%, surpassing existing quantum\nbaselines.

While probing techniques have shown promising\nsigns of this in scientific and game-based settings, they rely on\nmodel-specific internal activations, which limit interpretability and\ngeneralizability. In this work, we propose a model-agnostic, state-based\nevaluation framework using chess as a benchmark to assess whether LLMs preserve\nthe semantics of structured environments. Our method analyzes the downstream\nlegal move distributions (state affordances) to estimate semantic fidelity\nbetween predicted and actual game states. This approach offers a more\nmeaningful evaluation than conventional string-based metrics by aligning more\nclosely with the strategic and rule-governed nature of chess. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that our metrics capture deficiencies in state-tracking,\nhighlighting limitations of LLMs in maintaining coherent internal models over\nlong sequences.

This review paper presents\nclassification of image steganography and the comparison of various Image\nsteganography tools using different image formats. Analyzing numerous tools on\nthe basis of Image features and extracting the best one. Some of the tools\navailable in the market were selected based on the frequent use; these tools\nwere tested using the same input on all of them.

However, this growth\nhas also attracted malicious actors, leading to a corresponding increase in\nsophisticated social engineering scams. These scams are often initiated and\norchestrated on multiple surfaces outside the payment platform, making user and\ntransaction-based signals insufficient for a complete understanding of the\nscam's methodology and underlying patterns, without which it is very difficult\nto prevent it in a timely manner. This paper presents CASE (Conversational\nAgent for Scam Elucidation), a novel Agentic AI framework that addresses this\nproblem by collecting and managing user scam feedback in a safe and scalable\nmanner. A conversational agent is uniquely designed to proactively interview\npotential victims to elicit intelligence in the form of a detailed\nconversation. The conversation transcripts are then consumed by another AI\nsystem that extracts information and converts it into structured data for\ndownstream usage in automated and manual enforcement mechanisms. Using Google's\nGemini family of LLMs, we implemented this framework on Google Pay (GPay)\nIndia. By augmenting our existing features with this new intelligence, we have\nobserved a 21% uplift in the volume of scam enforcements. The architecture and\nits robust evaluation framework are highly generalizable, offering a blueprint\nfor building similar AI-driven systems to collect and manage scam intelligence\nin other sensitive domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uacb0\uc81c \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc758 \ud655\uc0b0\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc0c1\uc5c5\uc774 \ubcc0\ubaa8\ud558\uc600\uace0, \uc774\ub294 \uc18c\uc15c \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\ub9c1 \uc0ac\uae30\uc758 \uc99d\uac00\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 AI \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 CASE\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uacb0\uc81c \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc758 \uc131\uc7a5\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc0c1\uc5c5\uc774 \ud3b8\ub9ac\ud574\uc84c\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub294 \uc545\uc758\uc801\uc778 \ud589\uc704\uc790\ub97c \ub04c\uc5b4\ub4e4\uc774\uace0 \uace0\ub3c4\ud654\ub41c \uc0ac\uae30\ub97c \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ucf30\ub2e4.", "method": "CASE\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc0ac\uae30 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \uc548\uc804\ud558\uace0 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\uc9d1\ud558\uace0 \uad00\ub9ac\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub300\ud654\ud615 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uc5ec \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \ud53c\ud574\uc790\uc640\uc758 \ub300\ud654\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc5bb\ub294\ub2e4.", "result": "Google Pay(\uc778\ub3c4)\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uad6c\ud604\ud558\uc5ec \uc0ac\uae30 \uc9d1\ud589\ub7c9\uc774 21% \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc640 \ud3c9\uac00 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ub2e4\ub978 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \uc601\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\uae30 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc218\uc9d1\ud558\uace0 \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c AI \uae30\ubc18 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uad6c\ucd95\uc758 \uccad\uc0ac\uc9c4\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uacb0\uc81c \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc758 \ud655\uc0b0\uc740 \uc0c1\uc5c5\uc744 \ubcc0\ud654\uc2dc\ucf30\uace0, \uc804 \uc138\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ube44\uad50\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \ud3b8\ub9ac\ud568\uacfc \uc811\uadfc\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc131\uc7a5\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc545\uc758\uc801\uc778 \ud589\uc704\uc790\ub4e4\uc774 \ub04c\ub824\ub4e4\uc5b4\uc640 \uc815\uad50\ud55c \uc18c\uc15c \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\ub9c1 \uc0ac\uae30\uac00 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc0ac\uae30\ub294 \uc885\uc885 \uacb0\uc81c \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc \uc678\ubd80\uc758 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub9e4\uccb4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\uc791\ub418\uac70\ub098 \uc870\uc815\ub418\uc5b4 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ubc0f \uac70\ub798 \uae30\ubc18 \uc2e0\ud638\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \uc0ac\uae30\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uacfc \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \uc644\uc804\ud788 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uae30\uc5d0 \ubd88\ucda9\ubd84\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 CASE(Scam Elucidation\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub300\ud654\ud615 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8)\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub300\ud654\ud615 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \ud53c\ud574\uc790\uc640\uc758 \uc0c1\uc138\ud55c \ub300\ud654\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ub04c\uc5b4\ub0b4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud130\ubdf0\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud2b9\ubcc4\ud788 \uc124\uacc4\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ud6c4 \ub300\ud654 \uae30\ub85d\uc740 \ub2e4\ub978 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc18c\ube44\ub418\uc5b4 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\uc5ec \uc790\ub3d9\ud654 \ubc0f \uc218\ub3d9 \uc9d1\ud589 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc5d0\uc11c \ud558\ub958 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ud65c\uc6a9\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.

The bug requires exactly 8 even\nheads at Layer 10 for perfect repair. Any combination of 8+ even heads\nsucceeds, while 7 or fewer completely fails, revealing sharp computational\nthresholds with perfect redundancy among the 16 even heads. SAE analysis\nreveals the mechanism: format representations separate (10% feature overlap at\nLayer 7), then re-entangle with different weightings (80% feature overlap at\nLayer 10), with specific features showing 1.5x amplification in failing\nformats. We achieve perfect repair using only 25% of attention heads and\nidentify a 60% pattern replacement threshold, demonstrating that apparent\nfull-module requirements hide sophisticated substructure with implications for\ninterpretability and efficiency.

Although dorking alone yielded a false\npositive rate of approximately 20.3\\%, the integration of crawling and\nkeyword-counting enabled reliable differentiation between true and false\npositives. Our measurements revealed diverse defacement behaviors, including\nrepeat defacements (150 cases), fixed instances (129), keyword modifications\n(55), and redirections or hidden URL injections. In total, 8,837 unique\nthird-party URLs spanning 5,930 domains were captured, with a small subset\nrecurring across multiple sites. Website responses were inconsistent, with an\naverage reaction time of 75.3 hours.

For very large plants, like semiconductor fabs, the problem\nbecomes unsolvable on a plant-wide scale in a reasonable amount of time using\nclassical linear optimization. An alternative approach is the use of swarm\nintelligence algorithms. These have been applied to the job-shop problem\nbefore, but often in a centrally calculated way where they are applied to the\nsolution space, but they can be implemented in a bottom-up fashion to avoid\nglobal result computation as well. One of the problems in semiconductor\nproduction is that the production process requires a lot of switching between\nmachines that process lots one after the other and machines that process\nbatches of lots at once, often with long processing times. In this paper, we\naddress this switching problem with the ``boids'' flocking algorithm that was\noriginally used in robotics and movie industry. The flocking behavior is a\nbio-inspired algorithm that uses only local information and interaction based\non simple heuristics. We show that this algorithm addresses these valid\nconsiderations in production plant optimization, as it reacts to the switching\nof machine kinds similar to how a swarm of flocking animals would react to\nobstacles in its course.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ud604\ub300 \uc0dd\uc0b0 \uacf5\uc7a5\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub294 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \ubb38\uc81c\uc774\uba70, \ubc18\ub3c4\uccb4 \uacf5\uc7a5\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uacf5\uc7a5\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc120\ud615 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30\uac00 \uc5b4\ub835\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubc18\ub3c4\uccb4 \uc0dd\uc0b0 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uacc4 \uac04\uc758 \uc804\ud658\uc774 \ube48\ubc88\ud558\uac8c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc0dd\uc0b0 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc5d0 \ud070 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ub41c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 '\ubcf4\uc774\ub4dc' \uad70\uc9d1 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\uacc4 \uc885\ub958 \uac04\uc758 \uc804\ud658 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \ub85c\ubd07 \ubc0f \uc601\ud654 \uc0b0\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uc5c8\uace0, \uc9c0\uc5ed \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \uc0dd\uc0b0 \uacf5\uc7a5 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud558\uac8c \uace0\ub824\ud574\uc57c \ud560 \uc804\ud658 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub300\uc751\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uac00 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \uad70\uc9d1 \ub3d9\ubb3c\uc774 \uc7a5\uc560\ubb3c\uc5d0 \ubc18\uc751\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uacfc \uc720\uc0ac\ud558\uac8c \uae30\uacc4 \uc804\ud658\uc5d0 \ubc18\uc751\ud558\uc5ec \uc0dd\uc0b0 \uacf5\uc7a5\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uae30\uc5ec\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud604\ub300 \uc0dd\uc0b0 \uacf5\uc7a5\uc744 \uc791\uc5c5 \ub300\uae30 \uc6d0\uce59\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc798 \uc54c\ub824\uc9c4 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \ubb38\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubc18\ub3c4\uccb4 \ud339\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ud070 \uacf5\uc7a5\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud074\ub798\uc2dd \uc120\ud615 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud569\ub9ac\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\uac04 \ub0b4\uc5d0 \uacf5\uc7a5 \uc804\uccb4 \ubc0f \uaddc\ubaa8\uc5d0\uc11c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ubd88\uac00\ub2a5\ud574\uc9d1\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub300\uc548\uc801\uc778 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \uad70\uc9d1 \uc9c0\ub2a5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \uc774\uc804\uc5d0 \uc791\uc5c5 \ub300\uae30 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\ub098, \uc911\uc559\uc5d0\uc11c \uacc4\uc0b0\ub41c \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\uc558\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uadf8\ub4e4\uc740 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uacb0\uacfc \uacc4\uc0b0\uc744 \ud53c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud558\ud5a5\uc2dd \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\ud604\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubc18\ub3c4\uccb4 \uc0dd\uc0b0\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c \uc911 \ud558\ub098\ub294 \uc0dd\uc0b0 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uacc4 \uac04\uc758 \uc804\ud658\uc774 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ub9ce\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uacfc\uc815\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uae34 \ucc98\ub9ac \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \ub3d9\ubc18\ud558\uba70, \uc5f0\uc18d \ucc98\ub9ac\uc640 \ubc30\uce58 \ucc98\ub9ac\uac00 \ud568\uaed8 \uc874\uc7ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub85c\ubd07 \ubc0f \uc601\ud654 \uc0b0\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6d0\ub798 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub41c '\ubcf4\uc774\ub4dc' \uad70\uc9d1 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 \uc804\ud658 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8f9\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad70\uc9d1 \ud589\ub3d9\uc740 \uc9c0\uc5ed \uc815\ubcf4\uc640 \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ub9cc\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc0dd\ubb3c \uc601\uac10 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc774 \uc0dd\uc0b0 \uacf5\uc7a5 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774 \uc720\ud6a8\ud55c \uace0\ub824 \uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uc5ec, \uad70\uc9d1 \ub3d9\ubb3c\uc774 \uacbd\ub85c\uc758 \uc7a5\uc560\ubb3c\uc5d0 \ubc18\uc751\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uacfc \uc720\uc0ac\ud558\uac8c \uae30\uacc4 \uc885\ub958 \uac04\uc758 \uc804\ud658\uc5d0 \ubc18\uc751\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Predicting\nbehavior in this setting relies on high-fidelity physics-based simulations that\nare computationally expensive. Yet, the uncertain, heterogeneous properties\nthat control these flows make it necessary to perform many of these expensive\nsimulations, which is often prohibitive. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce a physics-informed machine learning workflow that couples a fully\ndifferentiable multiphase flow simulator, which is implemented in the DPFEHM\nframework with a convolutional neural network (CNN). The CNN learns to predict\nfluid extraction rates from heterogeneous permeability fields to enforce\npressure limits at critical reservoir locations. By incorporating transient\nmultiphase flow physics into the training process, our method enables more\npractical and accurate predictions for realistic injection-extraction scenarios\ncompare to previous works. To speed up training, we pretrain the model on\nsingle-phase, steady-state simulations and then fine-tune it on full multiphase\nscenarios, which dramatically reduces the computational cost. We demonstrate\nthat high-accuracy training can be achieved with fewer than three thousand\nfull-physics multiphase flow simulations -- compared to previous estimates\nrequiring up to ten million. This drastic reduction in the number of\nsimulations is achieved by leveraging transfer learning from much less\nexpensive single-phase simulations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubb3c\ub9ac \uae30\ubc18 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \ubb3c\uccb4\ucd94\ucd9c \uc608\uce21 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774 \uc801\uc6a9\ub41c \uba38\uc2e0\ub7ec\ub2dd\uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub97c \uc81c\uc548.", "motivation": "\uc9c0\uc9c8 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131\uacfc \ub2e4\uc0c1 \uc720\uccb4 \ud750\ub984 \ub3d9 \uc5ed\ud559\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc9c0\ud558 \uc800\uc218\uc555 \uc81c\uc5b4\uac00 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6cc\uc9d0.", "method": "\uc644\uc804\ud788 \ubbf8\ubd84 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub2e4\uc0c1 \uc720\uccb4 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\ud130\ub97c CNN\uacfc \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \ubb3c\ub9ac \uae30\ubc18 \uba38\uc2e0\ub7ec\ub2dd \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785.", "result": "\uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ucc9c\uc5f0 \ubb3c\ub9ac\ub97c \uc9c0\ub2cc \ub2e4\uc0c1 \uc720\uccb4 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc73c\ub85c \ub192\uc740 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub2ec\uc131.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc720\uc9c8 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc744 \ubc18\uc601\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uba70, \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uc218\ub97c \ub300\ud3ed \uc904\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\uc74c.", "translated_summary": "\uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc9c0\ud558 \uc800\uc218\uc9c0 \uc555\ub825 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub294 \uc9c0\uc9c8\uc801 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131\uacfc \ub2e4\uc0c1 \uc720\uccb4 \ud750\ub984 \uc5ed\ud559 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc608\uce21\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4dc\ub294 \uace0\ucda9\uc2e4\ub3c4 \ubb3c\ub9ac \uae30\ubc18 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud55c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud750\ub984\uc744 \uc81c\uc5b4\ud558\ub294 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud558\uace0 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc18d\uc131 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4dc\ub294 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \ub9ce\uc774 \uc218\ud589\ud574\uc57c \ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc885\uc885 \uae08\uc9c0\ub41c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 DPFEHM \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uad6c\ud604\ub41c \uc644\uc804\ud788 \ubbf8\ubd84 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub2e4\uc0c1 \ud750\ub984 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\ud130\uc640 \ucee8\ubcfc\ub8e8\uc158 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(CNN)\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \ubb3c\ub9ac \uc815\ubcf4 \uae30\ubc18 \uba38\uc2e0\ub7ec\ub2dd \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.

This thesis presents an analysis of the NIS2 Directive in this\ncontext and translates its provisions into concrete technical requirements.\nThese requirements inform the design and implementation of a modular, legally\ngrounded registry system intended to support competent authorities across the\nEU in meeting their obligations. Using the Design Science Research methodology,\nthe thesis transforms complex legal provisions into structured workflows,\ndeterministic classification algorithms, and interactive dashboards. The\nresulting system automates key regulatory processes, including entity\nregistration, classification, and notification, while enabling context-aware\nsupervision and reducing administrative burden. It supports both automated and\nmanual registration methods and introduces a contextual labeling system to\nhandle edge cases, risk factors, and cross-directive dependencies. Although\ndeveloped for the Norwegian regulatory ecosystem, the system is designed for\nadaptation by other member states with minimal modification.

Understanding the pan-cancer mutational landscape offers critical\ninsights into the molecular mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis. While\npatient-level machine learning techniques have been widely employed to identify\ntumor subtypes, cohort-level clustering, where entire cancer types are grouped\nbased on shared molecular features, has largely relied on classical statistical\nmethods.\n  Results. In this study, we introduce a novel unsupervised contrastive\nlearning framework to cluster 43 cancer types based on coding mutation data\nderived from the COSMIC database. For each cancer type, we construct two\ncomplementary mutation signatures: a gene-level profile capturing nucleotide\nsubstitution patterns across the most frequently mutated genes, and a\nchromosome-level profile representing normalized substitution frequencies\nacross chromosomes. These dual views are encoded using TabNet encoders and\noptimized via a multi-scale contrastive learning objective (NT-Xent loss) to\nlearn unified cancer-type embeddings. We demonstrate that the resulting latent\nrepresentations yield biologically meaningful clusters of cancer types,\naligning with known mutational processes and tissue origins. Our work\nrepresents the first application of contrastive learning to cohort-level cancer\nclustering, offering a scalable and interpretable framework for mutation-driven\ncancer subtyping.", "AI":

The Needham-Schroeder protocol, a\nfoundational authentication mechanism, has been extensively studied, including\nits integration with Physical Layer Security (PLS) techniques such as\nwatermarking and jamming. Recent research has used ProVerif to verify these\nmechanisms in terms of secrecy. However, the ProVerif-based approach limits the\nability to improve understanding of security beyond verification results. To\novercome these limitations, we re-model the same protocol using an Isabelle\nformalism that generates sound animation, enabling interactive and automated\nformal verification of security protocols. Our modelling and verification\nframework is generic and highly configurable, supporting both cryptography and\nPLS. For the same protocol, we have conducted a comprehensive analysis (secrecy\nand authenticity in four different eavesdropper locations under both passive\nand active attacks) using our new web interface. Our findings not only\nsuccessfully reproduce and reinforce previous results on secrecy but also\nreveal an uncommon but expected outcome: authenticity is preserved across all\nexamined scenarios, even in cases where secrecy is compromised. We have\nproposed a PLS-based Diffie-Hellman protocol that integrates watermarking and\njamming, and our analysis shows that it is secure for deriving a session key\nwith required authentication.

This approach removes a large degree of\nspatiotemporal redundancy present in trajectory data and oversamples states\nthat may be rarely visited but help the neural PDE generalize across the state\nspace. We demonstrate that accurate neural PDE stencil operators can be learned\nfrom synthetic training data generated by the computational equivalent of 10\ntimesteps' worth of numerical simulation. Accuracy is further improved if we\nassume access to a single full-trajectory simulation from the computer model,\nwhich is typically available in practice. Across several PDE systems, we show\nthat our data-augmented synthetic stencil data yield better trained neural\nstencil operators, with clear performance gains compared with naively sampled\nstencil data from simulation trajectories.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uad6d\uc18c '\uc2a4\ud150\uc2e4' \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc758 \uacf5\uac04 \ucc44\uc6b0\uae30 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2e0\uacbd PDE \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc99d\uac15 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2e0\uacbd PDE\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc218\uce58 PDE \uc194\ubc84\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc758 \uc720\uc5f0\uc131\uacfc \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud568\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub85c\uceec '\uc2a4\ud150\uc2e4' \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc758 \uacf5\uac04 \ucc44\uc6b0\uae30 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc99d\uac15 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud569\uc131 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc2e0\uacbd PDE \uc2a4\ud150\uc2e4 \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc790\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc99d\uac15\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc2e0\uacbd \uc2a4\ud150\uc2e4 \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc790\ub97c \uc5bb\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubd80\ubd84 \ubbf8\ubd84 \ubc29\uc815\uc2dd(PDE)\uc740 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc790\uc5f0 \ubc0f \uacf5\ud559 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc744 \ub4b7\ubc1b\uce68\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc218\uce58 PDE \uc194\ubc84\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub300\uc2e0 \uc2e0\uacbd \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ud45c\ud604\uc73c\ub85c PDE\uc758 \uc9c0\ubc30 \ubc29\uc815\uc2dd\uc758 \uc77c\ubd80 \ub610\ub294 \uc804\ubd80\ub97c \ub300\uccb4\ud558\ub294 \uc2e0\uacbd PDE\ub85c \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud45c\ud604\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ud3b8\ub9ac\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e0\uacbd PDE\ub294 \uc6d0\ub798\uc758 \uc218\uce58 \uc194\ubc84\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ubbf8\ubd84, \uc120\ud615\ud654, \ucd95\uc18c \ub610\ub294 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\uc5d0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uae30\uac00 \ub354 \uc27d\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c PDE \uc194\ubc84\uc758 \uae34 \uc2dc\uac04 \ud1b5\ud569\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5bb\uc740 \ud574 \uace1\uc120\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6c8\ub828\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5ec\uae30\uc11c\ub294 \ub85c\uceec '\uc2a4\ud150\uc2e4' \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc758 \uacf5\uac04 \ucc44\uc6b0\uae30 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud130 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e0\uacbd PDE \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub354 \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc99d\uac15 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uada4\uc801 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\ub294 \ud070 \uc815\ub3c4\uc758 \uc2dc\uacf5\uac04 \uc911\ubcf5\uc744 \uc81c\uac70\ud558\uace0, \ub4dc\ubb3c\uac8c \ubc29\ubb38\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc2e0\uacbd PDE\uac00 \uc0c1\ud0dc \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc774 \ub418\ub294 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \uacfc\uc789 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. 10\ud0c0\uc784\uc2a4\ud15d\uc758 \uc218\uce58 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uacfc \ub3d9\ub4f1\ud55c \uacc4\uc0b0\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \ud569\uc131 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc2e0\uacbd PDE \uc2a4\ud150\uc2e4 \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc790\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc2dc\uc5f0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2e4\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud130 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e8\uc77c \uc804\uccb4 \uacbd\ub85c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc5d0 \uc811\uadfc\ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \uac00\uc815\ud558\uba74 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uac00 \ub354\uc6b1 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5ec\ub7ec PDE \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc99d\uac15 \ud569\uc131 \uc2a4\ud150\uc2e4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub294 \uc218\uce58 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uada4\uc801\uc5d0\uc11c \ubb34\uc791\uc704\ub85c \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\ud55c \uc2a4\ud150\uc2e4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec \ubd84\uba85\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc2e0\uacbd \uc2a4\ud150\uc2e4 \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc790\ub97c \uc0b0\ucd9c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Especially when these experiments are very expensive, it is\nbecoming more reasonable to generate synthetic data for downstream tasks.\nRecently, these methods may include using generative machine learning models\nsuch as Generative Adversarial Networks or diffusion models. As these\ngenerative models improve efficiency in producing useful data, we introduce an\ninternal tensor decomposition to these generative models to even further reduce\ncosts.

This challenge is further compounded by\nadversarial attacks, emphasizing the need for resilient methods that ensure\nrobust performance and efficient model selection. To address this challenge, we\npropose ReLATE+, a comprehensive framework that detects and classifies\nadversarial attacks, adaptively selects deep learning models based on\ndataset-level similarity, and thus substantially reduces retraining costs\nrelative to conventional methods that do not leverage prior knowledge, while\nmaintaining strong performance. ReLATE+ first checks whether the incoming data\nis adversarial and, if so, classifies the attack type, using this insight to\nidentify a similar dataset from a repository and enable the reuse of the\nbest-performing associated model. This approach ensures strong performance\nwhile reducing the need for retraining, and it generalizes well across\ndifferent domains with varying data distributions and feature spaces.\nExperiments show that ReLATE+ reduces computational overhead by an average of\n77.68%, enhancing adversarial resilience and streamlining robust model\nselection, all without sacrificing performance, within 2.02% of Oracle.", "AI": {"tldr": "ReLATE+\ub294 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9 \uac10\uc9c0 \ubc0f \ubd84\ub958, \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b \uc720\uc0ac\uc131\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd \ubaa8\ub378 \uc120\ud0dd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \ubd84\ub958\uc758 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c \ud3c9\uade0 77.68% \uc904\uc774\uba70 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uacfc \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8\uc758 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \ubd84\ub958\uc758 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ud070 \ub3c4\uc804\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "ReLATE+\ub294 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \uac10\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \ubd84\ub958\ud558\uba70, \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\ub294 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc ReLATE+\ub294 \ud3c9\uade0 77.68%\uc758 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c \uc904\uc774\uba70, \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ubcf5\uc6d0\ub825\uacfc \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378 \uc120\ud0dd\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "ReLATE+\ub294 \uc7ac\uad50\uc721 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uace0 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc640 \ud2b9\uc131 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \uc798 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub41c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \ubd84\ub958\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc758 \ub192\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uacfc \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ub300\ud55c \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uc591 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \ud070 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ub41c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub294 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ub354\uc6b1 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud574\uc9c0\uba70, \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc120\ud0dd\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \ud68c\ubcf5\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 ReLATE+\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \uac10\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \ubd84\ub958\ud558\uba70, \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc0ac\uc804 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc7ac\uad50\uc721 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \uc904\uc774\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4.

In generative models, surjectivity implies that any output,\nincluding harmful or undesirable content, can in principle be generated by the\nnetworks, raising concerns about model safety and jailbreak vulnerabilities. In\nthis paper, we prove that many fundamental building blocks of modern neural\narchitectures, such as networks with pre-layer normalization and\nlinear-attention modules, are almost always surjective. As corollaries, widely\nused generative frameworks, including GPT-style transformers and diffusion\nmodels with deterministic ODE solvers, admit inverse mappings for arbitrary\noutputs. By studying surjectivity of these modern and commonly used neural\narchitectures, we contribute a formalism that sheds light on their unavoidable\nvulnerability to a broad class of adversarial attacks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ud604\ub300 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc758 \ub9ce\uc740 \uae30\ubcf8 \ube14\ub85d\uc774 \ud56d\uc0c1 \uc804\uc0ac\uc801\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud558\uc5ec \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \ubc1d\ud600\ub0c4.", "motivation": "\uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uacfc \ud0c8\uc625 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc6b0\ub824\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc758 \uc804\uc0ac\uc131 \ubd84\uc11d.", "method": "\ubaa8\ub358 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc758 \uae30\ubcf8 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc5ec \uadf8\ub4e4\uc758 \uc804\uc0ac\uc131\uc744 \uc99d\uba85.", "result": "\ub9ce\uc740 \ud604\ub300 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uac00 \uac70\uc758 \ud56d\uc0c1 \uc804\uc0ac\uc801\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uace0, \uc81c\ub124\ub808\uc774\ud2f0\ube0c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc784\uc758\uc758 \ucd9c\ub825\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5ed \ub9e4\ud551\uc744 \ud5c8\uc6a9\ud568.", "conclusion": "\ud604\ub300 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc758 \uc804\uc0ac\uc131\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub113\uc740 \ubc94\uc704\uc758 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uadf8\ub4e4\uc758 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \uba85\ud655\ud788 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc774 \uc8fc\uc5b4\uc84c\uc744 \ub54c, \ud2b9\uc815 \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc785\ub825\uc774 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\ub294\uac00? \uc989, \ud574\ub2f9 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 \uc804\uc0ac \ud568\uc218\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\ub294\uac00? \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \uc804\uc0ac\uc131\uc740 \ud574\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub610\ub294 \ubc14\ub78c\uc9c1\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ucf58\ud150\uce20\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc758\ubbf8\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uacfc \ud0c8\uc625 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc6b0\ub824\ub97c \uc81c\uae30\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4 \uc815\uaddc\ud654\uc640 \uc120\ud615 \uc8fc\uc758 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc744 \uac16\ucd98 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ud604\ub300 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc758 \ub9ce\uc740 \uae30\ubcf8 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\uac00 \uac70\uc758 \ud56d\uc0c1 \uc804\uc0ac\uc801\uc784\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud55c\ub2e4. \uadf8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub85c, GPT \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c\uc758 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30 \ubc0f \uacb0\uc815\ub860\uc801 ODE \uc194\ubc84\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \uc0dd\uc131 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc784\uc758\uc758 \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc5ed \ub9e4\ud551\uc744 \ud5c8\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud604\ub300\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc758 \uc804\uc0ac\uc131\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc774\ub4e4\uc758 \ud53c\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \ubc1d\ud788\ub294 \ud615\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

Although widely adopted for convenience, traditional\nauthentication mechanisms like Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and Near\nField Communication (NFC) rely on static identifiers and weak encryption,\nmaking them highly vulnerable to attack vectors such as cloning, relay attacks,\nand signal interception. This study explores an AI-powered adaptive\nauthentication framework designed to overcome these shortcomings by integrating\nmachine learning, anomaly detection, behavioral analytics, and contextual risk\nassessment. Grounded in the principles of Zero Trust Architecture, the proposed\nframework emphasizes continuous verification, least privilege access, and\nsecure communication. Through a comprehensive literature review, this research\nevaluates current vulnerabilities and highlights AI-driven solutions to provide\na scalable, resilient, and proactive defense. Ultimately, the research findings\nconclude that adopting AI-powered adaptive authentication is a strategic\nimperative for securing the future of electric mobility and strengthening\ndigital trust across the ecosystem.

A\nsuccessful membership-inference attack typically requires the attacker to have\nsome knowledge about the distribution that the training data was sampled from,\nand this knowledge is often captured through a set of independent reference\nsamples from that distribution. In this work we study how much information the\nattacker needs for membership inference by investigating the sample\ncomplexity-the minimum number of reference samples required-for a successful\nattack. We study this question in the fundamental setting of Gaussian mean\nestimation where the learning algorithm is given $n$ samples from a Gaussian\ndistribution $\\mathcal{N}(\\mu,\\Sigma)$ in $d$ dimensions, and tries to estimate\n$\\hat\\mu$ up to some error $\\mathbb{E}[\\|\\hat \\mu - \\mu\\|^2_{\\Sigma}]\\leq\n\\rho^2 d$. Our result shows that for membership inference in this setting,\n$\\Omega(n + n^2 \\rho^2)$ samples can be necessary to carry out any attack that\ncompetes with a fully informed attacker. Our result is the first to show that\nthe attacker sometimes needs many more samples than the training algorithm uses\nto train the model. This result has significant implications for practice, as\nall attacks used in practice have a restricted form that uses $O(n)$ samples\nand cannot benefit from $\\omega(n)$ samples. Thus, these attacks may be\nunderestimating the possibility of membership inference, and better attacks may\nbe possible when information about the distribution is easy to obtain.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uba64\ubc84\uc2ed \ucd94\ub860 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc778 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ucc38\uc870 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc758 \ucd5c\uc18c \uc218\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uba64\ubc84\uc2ed \ucd94\ub860 \uacf5\uaca9\uc758 \uc774\ud574\uc640 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4\ub7c9\uc744 \uaddc\uba85\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "\uc815\uaddc \ubd84\ud3ec\ub85c\ubd80\ud130\uc758 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 n\uac1c \ubc1b\uc544 \ud3c9\uade0 \ucd94\uc815\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ucc38\uc870 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc758 \uc218\ub97c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc778 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc0d8\ud50c \uc218\ub294 $\forall n, \text{\uc774 \uacf5\uaca9\uc774 \uc131\uacf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 $\text{O}(n + n^2 \rho^2)$ \uc0d8\ud50c\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ubc1c\uacac\uc740 \uacf5\uaca9\uc774 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc774 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc0d8\ud50c\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud6e8\uc52c \ub354 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uba64\ubc84\uc2ed \ucd94\ub860 \uacf5\uaca9\uc740 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \uc5bb\uace0, \ubaa9\ud45c \uac1c\uc778\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud558\uba70, \uc774 \uac1c\uc778\uc774 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uc77c\uc6d0\uc778\uc9c0 \uc544\ub2c8\uba74 \ub3d9\uc77c \ubd84\ud3ec\uc5d0\uc11c \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc778\uc9c0 \ud310\ub2e8\ud558\ub824\uace0 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc778 \uba64\ubc84\uc2ed \ucd94\ub860 \uacf5\uaca9\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uacf5\uaca9\uc790\uac00 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\ub41c \ubd84\ud3ec\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc5b4\uc57c \ud558\uba70, \uc774 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \ud574\ub2f9 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \ucc38\uc870 \uc0d8\ud50c \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud3ec\ucc29\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc778 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uacf5\uaca9\uc790\uac00 \uc5bc\ub9c8\ub098 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc815\ubcf4\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud55c\uc9c0\ub97c \uc0d8\ud50c \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131(\uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc778 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ucc38\uc870 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc758 \ucd5c\uc18c \uc218)\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc870\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc774 d\ucc28\uc6d0 \uc815\uaddc \ubd84\ud3ec $\text{N}(\text{\u03bc},\text{\u03a3})$\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 n\uac1c\uc758 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \ubc1b\uc544 $\text{\u03bc}$\ub97c \uc624\ub958 $\text{E}[\text{\u2225}\text{\u03bc} - \text{\u03a3}\u2225^2] \u2264 \u03c1^2 d$\uae4c\uc9c0 \ucd94\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc774 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uba64\ubc84\uc2ed \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc704\ud574 $\text{\u03a9}(n + n^2 \u03c1^2)$ \uc0d8\ud50c\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uacf5\uaca9\uc790\uac00 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc0d8\ud50c\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud6e8\uc52c \ub354 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\ub294 \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \uacb0\uacfc\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uacf5\uaca9\uc774 $O(n)$ \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ud615\ud0dc\ub97c \uac00\uc9c0\uba70, $\text{\u03c9}(n)$ \uc0d8\ud50c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc774\ub4dd\uc744 \ubcfc \uc218 \uc5c6\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \ud568\uc758\uac00 \ud07d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacf5\uaca9\uc740 \uba64\ubc84\uc2ed \ucd94\ub860\uc758 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uacfc\uc18c\ud3c9\uac00\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ubd84\ud3ec\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4\uac00 \uc27d\uac8c \uc5bb\uc5b4\uc9c8 \ub54c \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uacf5\uaca9\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Existing detection tools rarely target the diverse\nsubcategories of CWE-200 or provide context-aware analysis of code-level data\nflows.\n  Aims: This paper aims to present SIExVulTS, a novel vulnerability detection\nsystem that integrates transformer-based models with static analysis to\nidentify and verify sensitive information exposure in Java applications.\n  Method: SIExVulTS employs a three-stage architecture: (1) an Attack Surface\nDetection Engine that uses sentence embeddings to identify sensitive variables,\nstrings, comments, and sinks; (2) an Exposure Analysis Engine that instantiates\nCodeQL queries aligned with the CWE-200 hierarchy; and (3) a Flow Verification\nEngine that leverages GraphCodeBERT to semantically validate source-to-sink\nflows. We evaluate SIExVulTS using three curated datasets, including real-world\nCVEs, a benchmark set of synthetic CWE-200 examples, and labeled flows from 31\nopen-source projects.\n  Results: The Attack Surface Detection Engine achieved an average F1 score\ngreater than 93\\%, the Exposure Analysis Engine achieved an F1 score of\n85.71\\%, and the Flow Verification Engine increased precision from 22.61\\% to\n87.23\\%. Moreover, SIExVulTS successfully uncovered six previously unknown CVEs\nin major Apache projects.\n  Conclusions: The results demonstrate that SIExVulTS is effective and\npractical for improving software security against sensitive data exposure,\naddressing limitations of existing tools in detecting and verifying CWE-200\nvulnerabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "SIExVulTS\ub294 Java \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4 \ub178\ucd9c\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30 \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uc815\uc801 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4 \ub178\ucd9c(SIEx) \ucde8\uc57d\uc810(CWE-200)\uc740 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\ub294 \uc704\ud611\uc73c\ub85c, \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \ubcf4\uc548 \uce68\ud574\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "SIExVulTS\ub294 \uc138 \ub2e8\uacc4 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \ucc44\ud0dd\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4: (1) \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \ubcc0\uc218, \ubb38\uc790\uc5f4, \uc8fc\uc11d \ubc0f \uc2f1\ud06c\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc7a5 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uacf5\uaca9 \ud45c\uba74 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc5d4\uc9c4; (2) CWE-200 \uacc4\uce35\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucdb0 CodeQL \ucffc\ub9ac\ub97c \uad6c\ud604\ud558\ub294 \ub178\ucd9c \ubd84\uc11d \uc5d4\uc9c4; (3) \uc18c\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2f1\ud06c\ub85c\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud750\ub984\uc744 \uc758\ubbf8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 GraphCodeBERT\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ud750\ub984 \uac80\uc99d \uc5d4\uc9c4.", "result": "\uacf5\uaca9 \ud45c\uba74 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc5d4\uc9c4\uc740 93% \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \ud3c9\uade0 F1 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uace0, \ub178\ucd9c \ubd84\uc11d \uc5d4\uc9c4\uc740 85.71%\uc758 F1 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \uae30\ub85d\ud588\uc73c\uba70, \ud750\ub984 \uac80\uc99d \uc5d4\uc9c4\uc740 \uc815\ubc00\ub3c4\ub97c 22.61%\uc5d0\uc11c 87.23%\ub85c \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ucf30\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c SIExVulTS\ub294 \uc8fc\uc694 Apache \ud504\ub85c\uc81d\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5ec\uc12f \uac1c\uc758 \uc774\uc804\uc5d0 \uc54c\ub824\uc9c0\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 CVE\ub97c \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uacb0\uacfc\ub294 SIExVulTS\uac00 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ub178\ucd9c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \ubcf4\uc548\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, CWE-200 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4 \ub178\ucd9c(SIEx) \ucde8\uc57d\uc810(CWE-200)\uc740 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\ub294 \uc704\ud611\uc73c\ub85c, \uc885\uc885 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \ubcf4\uc548 \uce68\ud574\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc9c4\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub294 CWE-200\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud558\uc704 \uce74\ud14c\uace0\ub9ac\ub97c \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud558\uac70\ub098 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud750\ub984\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub9e5\ub77d \uc778\uc2dd \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 Java \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4 \ub178\ucd9c\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30 \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uc815\uc801 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc778 SIExVulTS\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

Benchmarking Privacy Awareness in MLLM-powered Smartphone Agents", "comment": null, "summary": "Smartphones bring significant convenience to users but also enable devices to\nextensively record various types of personal information. Existing smartphone\nagents powered by Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved\nremarkable performance in automating different tasks. However, as the cost,\nthese agents are granted substantial access to sensitive users' personal\ninformation during this operation. To gain a thorough understanding of the\nprivacy awareness of these agents, we present the first large-scale benchmark\nencompassing 7,138 scenarios to the best of our knowledge. In addition, for\nprivacy context in scenarios, we annotate its type (e.g., Account Credentials),\nsensitivity level, and location. We then carefully benchmark seven available\nmainstream smartphone agents. Our results demonstrate that almost all\nbenchmarked agents show unsatisfying privacy awareness (RA), with performance\nremaining below 60% even with explicit hints. Overall, closed-source agents\nshow better privacy ability than open-source ones, and Gemini 2.0-flash\nachieves the best, achieving an RA of 67%.

The attack chain describes and\ndemonstrates how benign, individually authorized tasks can be orchestrated to\nproduce harmful emergent behaviors. Through systematic analysis using the MITRE\nATLAS framework, we demonstrate how 95 agents tested with access to multiple\nservices-including browser automation, financial analysis, location tracking,\nand code deployment-can chain legitimate operations into sophisticated attack\nsequences that extend beyond the security boundaries of any individual service.\nThese red team exercises survey whether current MCP architectures lack\ncross-domain security measures necessary to detect or prevent a large category\nof compositional attacks. We present empirical evidence of specific attack\nchains that achieve targeted harm through service orchestration, including data\nexfiltration, financial manipulation, and infrastructure compromise. These\nfindings reveal that the fundamental security assumption of service isolation\nfails when agents can coordinate actions across multiple domains, creating an\nexponential attack surface that grows with each additional capability. This\nresearch provides a barebones experimental framework that evaluate not whether\nagents can complete MCP benchmark tasks, but what happens when they complete\nthem too well and optimize across multiple services in ways that violate human\nexpectations and safety constraints.

Existing methods often leverage HE for linear\nlayers (e.g., matrix multiplications) and MPC for non-linear layers (e.g.,\nSoftmax activation functions), but the conversion between HE and MPC introduces\nsignificant communication costs. The proposed framework, dubbed BLB, overcomes\nthis by breaking down layers into fine-grained operators and further fusing\nadjacent linear operators, reducing the need for HE/MPC conversions. To manage\nthe increased ciphertext bit width from the fused linear operators, BLB\nproposes the first secure conversion protocol between CKKS and MPC and enables\nCKKS-based computation of the fused operators. Additionally, BLB proposes an\nefficient matrix multiplication protocol for fused computation in Transformers.\nExtensive evaluations on BERT-base, BERT-large, and GPT2-base show that BLB\nachieves a $21\\times$ reduction in communication overhead compared to BOLT\n(S\\&P'24) and a $2\\times$ reduction compared to Bumblebee (NDSS'25), along with\nlatency reductions of $13\\times$ and $1.8\\times$, respectively, when leveraging\nGPU acceleration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc\ub97c \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub3d9\ud615 \uc554\ud638\ud654(HE)\uc640 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \ub2e4\uc790\uac04 \uacc4\uc0b0(MPC)\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc885\uc885 HE\ub97c \uc120\ud615 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\uc5d0, MPC\ub97c \ube44\uc120\ud615 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\uc5d0 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc HE\uc640 MPC \uac04\uc758 \ubcc0\ud658\uc774 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c BLB\ub294 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\ub97c \uc138\ubd84\ud654\ub41c \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc790\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\uace0 \uc778\uc811\ud55c \uc120\ud615 \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc790\ub97c \uc735\ud569\ud558\uc5ec HE/MPC \ubcc0\ud658\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uc904\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, BLB\ub294 CKKS\uc640 MPC \uac04\uc758 \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \ubcc0\ud658 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc735\ud569\ub41c \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc790\uc758 CKKS \uae30\ubc18 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "BERT-base, BERT-large \ubc0f GPT2-base\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \ud3c9\uac00 \uacb0\uacfc, BLB\ub294 BOLT(S&P'24)\uc640 \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 $21\times$ \uc904\uc600\uace0, Bumblebee(NDSS'25)\uc640 \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec $2\times$ \uac10\uc18c\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, GPU \uac00\uc18d\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud560 \ub54c \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc2dc\uac04\uc740 \uac01\uac01 $13\times$\uacfc $1.8\times$ \uac10\uc18c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c BLB\ub294 Transformer\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc548\uc804\ud558\uace0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ube57 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc\ub97c \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub3d9\ud615 \uc554\ud638\ud654(HE)\uc640 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \ub2e4\uc790\uac04 \uacc4\uc0b0(MPC)\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc885\uc885 HE\ub97c \uc120\ud615 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\uc5d0 (\uc608: \ud589\ub82c \uacf1\uc148) \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uace0 MPC\ub97c \ube44\uc120\ud615 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\uc5d0 (\uc608: \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\ub9e5\uc2a4 \ud65c\uc131\ud654 \ud568\uc218) \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc HE\uc640 MPC \uac04\uc758 \ubcc0\ud658\uc774 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 BLB\ub294 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\ub97c \uc138\ubd84\ud654\ub41c \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc790\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\uace0 \uc778\uc811\ud55c \uc120\ud615 \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc790\ub97c \uc735\ud569\ud558\uc5ec HE/MPC \ubcc0\ud658\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uc904\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc735\ud569\ub41c \uc120\ud615 \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc790\uc5d0\uc11c \uc99d\uac00\ud55c \uc554\ud638\ubb38 \ube44\ud2b8 \ud3ed\uc744 \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, BLB\ub294 CKKS\uc640 MPC \uac04\uc758 \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \ubcc0\ud658 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc735\ud569\ub41c \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc790\uc758 CKKS \uae30\ubc18 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, BLB\ub294 Transformer\uc5d0\uc11c \uc735\ud569 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud589\ub82c \uacf1\uc148 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

As a result,\ntraining state-of-the-art graph machine learning (GML) models have become\nincreasingly resource-intensive, turning these models and data into invaluable\nIntellectual Property (IP). To address the resource-intensive nature of model\ntraining, graph-based Machine-Learning-as-a-Service (GMLaaS) has emerged as an\nefficient solution by leveraging third-party cloud services for model\ndevelopment and management. However, deploying such models in GMLaaS also\nexposes them to potential threats from attackers. Specifically, while the APIs\nwithin a GMLaaS system provide interfaces for users to query the model and\nreceive outputs, they also allow attackers to exploit and steal model\nfunctionalities or sensitive training data, posing severe threats to the safety\nof these GML models and the underlying graph data. To address these challenges,\nthis survey systematically introduces the first taxonomy of threats and\ndefenses at the level of both GML model and graph-structured data. Such a\ntailored taxonomy facilitates an in-depth understanding of GML IP protection.\nFurthermore, we present a systematic evaluation framework to assess the\neffectiveness of IP protection methods, introduce a curated set of benchmark\ndatasets across various domains, and discuss their application scopes and\nfuture challenges. Finally, we establish an open-sourced versatile library\nnamed PyGIP, which evaluates various attack and defense techniques in GMLaaS\nscenarios and facilitates the implementation of existing benchmark methods.

The FlipIt game\nprovides a foundational framework for modeling interactions between a defender\nand an advanced adversary that compromises a system without being immediately\ndetected. In FlipIt, the attacker and defender compete to control a shared\nresource by performing a Flip action and paying a cost. However, the existing\nFlipIt frameworks rely on a small number of heuristics or specialized learning\ntechniques, which can lead to brittleness and the inability to adapt to new\nattacks. To address these limitations, we introduce PoolFlip, a multi-agent gym\nenvironment that extends the FlipIt game to allow efficient learning for\nattackers and defenders. Furthermore, we propose Flip-PSRO, a multi-agent\nreinforcement learning (MARL) approach that leverages population-based training\nto train defender agents equipped to generalize against a range of unknown,\npotentially adaptive opponents. Our empirical results suggest that Flip-PSRO\ndefenders are $2\\times$ more effective than baselines to generalize to a\nheuristic attack not exposed in training.

Further analysis shows\nthat existing jailbreak attacks exploit this concentration by selectively\nbypassing or manipulating these critical attention heads. To address this\nissue, we propose AHD, a novel training strategy designed to promote the\ndistributed encoding of safety-related behaviors across numerous attention\nheads. Experimental results demonstrate that AHD successfully distributes\nsafety-related capabilities across more attention heads.

Our method treats decision-making policies as\nself-evolving code, with current observation as input and an in-game action as\noutput, enabling agents to self-improve through execution traces and natural\nlanguage feedback with minimal human intervention. Applied to Atari games, our\ngame-playing Python program achieves performance competitive with deep\nreinforcement learning (RL) baselines while using significantly less training\ntime and much fewer environment interactions.

Each shard is trained incrementally; at inference time,\nconstituent predictions are aggregated to yield the output. Deletion requests\ntrigger retraining solely of the affected shard from its last valid checkpoint,\nguaranteeing exact unlearning.

Due to its ability to\ntransparently save and restore complex objects into byte streams, many AI/ML\nframeworks continue to adopt pickle as the model serialization protocol despite\nits inherent risks. As the open-source model ecosystem grows, model-sharing\nplatforms such as Hugging Face have attracted massive participation,\nsignificantly amplifying the real-world risks of pickle exploitation and\nopening new avenues for model supply chain poisoning. Although several\nstate-of-the-art scanners have been developed to detect poisoned models, their\nincomplete understanding of the poisoning surface leaves the detection logic\nfragile and allows attackers to bypass them. In this work, we present the first\nsystematic disclosure of the pickle-based model poisoning surface from both\nmodel loading and risky function perspectives. Our research demonstrates how\npickle-based model poisoning can remain stealthy and highlights critical gaps\nin current scanning solutions. On the model loading surface, we identify 22\ndistinct pickle-based model loading paths across five foundational AI/ML\nframeworks, 19 of which are entirely missed by existing scanners. We further\ndevelop a bypass technique named Exception-Oriented Programming (EOP) and\ndiscover 9 EOP instances, 7 of which can bypass all scanners. On the risky\nfunction surface, we discover 133 exploitable gadgets, achieving almost a 100%\nbypass rate. Even against the best-performing scanner, these gadgets maintain\nan 89% bypass rate. By systematically revealing the pickle-based model\npoisoning surface, we achieve practical and robust bypasses against real-world\nscanners. We responsibly disclose our findings to corresponding vendors,\nreceiving acknowledgments and a $6000 bug bounty.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ud30c\uc774\uc36c\uc758 \ud53c\ud074 \uc5ed\uc9c1\ub82c\ud654

In particular, LLMs are\nincreasingly used as a plug-and-play method for fitting data and generating\npredictions. Prior work has shown that LLMs, via in-context learning or\nsupervised fine-tuning, can perform competitively with many tabular supervised\nlearning techniques in terms of predictive performance. However, we identify a\ncritical vulnerability of using LLMs for data fitting -- making changes to data\nrepresentation that are completely irrelevant to the underlying learning task\ncan drastically alter LLMs' predictions on the same data. For example, simply\nchanging variable names can sway the size of prediction error by as much as 82%\nin certain settings. Such prediction sensitivity with respect to\ntask-irrelevant variations manifests under both in-context learning and\nsupervised fine-tuning, for both close-weight and open-weight general-purpose\nLLMs. Moreover, by examining the attention scores of an open-weight LLM, we\ndiscover a non-uniform attention pattern: training examples and variable\nnames/values which happen to occupy certain positions in the prompt receive\nmore attention when output tokens are generated, even though different\npositions are expected to receive roughly the same attention. This partially\nexplains the sensitivity in the presence of task-irrelevant variations. We also\nconsider a state-of-the-art tabular foundation model (TabPFN) trained\nspecifically for data fitting. Despite being explicitly designed to achieve\nprediction robustness, TabPFN is still not immune to task-irrelevant\nvariations. Overall, despite LLMs' impressive predictive capabilities,\ncurrently they lack even the basic level of robustness to be used as a\nprincipled data-fitting tool.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\ud615

However, many studies consider\nattacks with the model in inference mode, where training-time behaviors like\ndropout are disabled and batch normalization relies on fixed statistics. In\nthis work, we systematically analyze how architecture and training behavior\naffect vulnerability, including the first in-depth study of inference-mode\nclients, which we show dramatically simplifies inversion. To assess attack\nfeasibility under more realistic conditions, we turn to clients operating in\nstandard training mode. In this setting, we find that successful attacks are\nonly possible when several architectural conditions are met simultaneously:\nmodels must be shallow and wide, use skip connections, and, critically, employ\npre-activation normalization. We introduce two novel attacks against models in\ntraining-mode with varying attacker knowledge, achieving state-of-the-art\nperformance under realistic training conditions. We extend these efforts by\npresenting the first attack on a production-grade object-detection model. Here,\nto enable any visibly identifiable leakage, we revert to the lenient inference\nmode setting and make multiple architectural modifications to increase model\nvulnerability, with the extent of required changes highlighting the strong\ninherent robustness of such architectures. We conclude this work by offering\nthe first comprehensive mapping of settings, clarifying which combinations of\narchitectural choices and operational modes meaningfully impact privacy. Our\nanalysis provides actionable insight into when models are likely vulnerable,\nwhen they appear robust, and where subtle leakage may persist. Together, these\nfindings reframe how gradient inversion risk should be assessed in future\nresearch and deployment scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \ubc18\uc804

While Sharpness-Aware Minimization\n(SAM) has proven effective in improving generalization by seeking flat minima,\nits substantial extra memory and computation overhead make it impractical for\nlarge models. Integrating SAM with parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like\nLow-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a promising direction. However, we find that\ndirectly applying SAM to LoRA parameters limits the sharpness optimization to a\nrestricted subspace, hindering its effectiveness. To address this limitation,\nwe propose Bi-directional Low-Rank Adaptation (Bi-LoRA), which introduces an\nauxiliary LoRA module to model SAM's adversarial weight perturbations. It\ndecouples SAM's weight perturbations from LoRA optimization: the primary LoRA\nmodule adapts to specific tasks via standard gradient descent, while the\nauxiliary module captures the sharpness of the loss landscape through gradient\nascent. Such dual-module design enables Bi-LoRA to capture broader sharpness\nfor achieving flatter minima while remaining memory-efficient. Another\nimportant benefit is that the dual design allows for simultaneous optimization\nand perturbation, eliminating SAM's doubled training costs. Extensive\nexperiments across diverse tasks and architectures demonstrate Bi-LoRA's\nefficiency and effectiveness in enhancing generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "Bi-LoRA\ub294 SAM\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uc5ec \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uace0 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud070 \ub3c4\uc804\uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "Bi-directional Low-Rank Adaptation (Bi-LoRA) \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 SAM\uc758 \uc801\ub300\uc801 weight \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uc5ec SAM\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uacfc \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 Bi-LoRA\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Bi-LoRA\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubaa8\ub4c8 \ub514\uc790\uc778\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ub354 \ub113\uc740 \uc0e4\ud504\ub2c8\uc2a4\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc0e4\ud504\ub2c8\uc2a4 \uc778\uc2dd \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654(SAM)\ub294 \ud3c9\ud3c9\ud55c \ucd5c\uc18c\uac12\uc744 \ucd94\uad6c\ud558\uc5ec \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc784\uc774 \uc785\uc99d\ub418\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ucd94\uac00 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ubc0f \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Recent work has focused on compliance of web\ntrackers with new privacy laws such as Europe's GDPR and California's CCPA.\nDespite the growing body of research documenting widespread lack of compliance\nwith new privacy laws, there is a lack of robust enforcement. Different from\nprior work, we conduct a tech-law analysis to map decades-old U.S. laws about\ninterception of electronic communications--so-called wiretapping--to web\ntracking. Bridging the tech-law gap for older wiretapping laws is important and\ntimely because, in cases where legal harm to privacy is proven, they can\nprovide statutory private right of action, are at the forefront of recent\nprivacy enforcement, and could ultimately lead to a meaningful change in the\nweb tracking landscape.\n  In this paper, we focus on a particularly invasive tracking technique: the\nuse of JavaScript event listeners by third-party trackers for real-time\nkeystroke interception on websites. We use an instrumented web browser to crawl\na sample of the top-million websites to investigate the use of event listeners\nthat aligns with the criteria for wiretapping, according to U.S. wiretapping\nlaw at the federal level and in California. We find evidence that 38.52%\nwebsites installed third-party event listeners to intercept keystrokes, and\nthat at least 3.18% websites transmitted intercepted information to a\nthird-party server, which aligns with the criteria for wiretapping. We further\nfind evidence that the intercepted information such as email addresses typed\ninto form fields are used for unsolicited email marketing. Beyond our work that\nmaps the intersection between technical measurement and U.S. wiretapping law,\nadditional future legal research is required to determine when the wiretapping\nobserved in our paper passes the threshold for illegality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc6f9 \ucd94\uc801 \uae30\uc220\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubbf8\uad6d\uc758 \uc624\ub798\ub41c \uc804\uc790

Bias mitigation studies have often applied passive\nconstraints, which can fail under causal confounding. Here, we present a\ncounterfactual reward model that introduces causal inference with multimodal\nrepresentation learning to provide an unsupervised, bias-resilient reward\nsignal. The heart of our contribution is the Counterfactual Trust Score, an\naggregated score consisting of four components: (1) counterfactual shifts that\ndecompose political framing bias from topical bias; (2) reconstruction\nuncertainty during counterfactual perturbations; (3) demonstrable violations of\nfairness rules for each protected attribute; and (4) temporal reward shifts\naligned with dynamic trust measures. We evaluated the framework on a multimodal\nfake versus true news dataset, which exhibits framing bias, class imbalance,\nand distributional drift. Following methodologies similar to unsupervised drift\ndetection from representation-based distances [1] and temporal robustness\nbenchmarking in language models [2], we also inject synthetic bias across\nsequential batches to test robustness. The resulting system achieved an\naccuracy of 89.12% in fake news detection, outperforming the baseline reward\nmodels. More importantly, it reduced spurious correlations and unfair\nreinforcement signals. This pipeline outlines a robust and interpretable\napproach to fairness-aware RLHF, offering tunable bias reduction thresholds and\nincreasing reliability in dynamic real-time policy making.", "AI":

LLM fingerprinting, a non-intrusive technique that extracts and compares\nthe distinctive features from LLMs to identify infringements, offers a\npromising solution to copyright auditing. However, its reliability remains\nuncertain due to the prevalence of diverse model modifications and the lack of\nstandardized evaluation. In this SoK, we present the first comprehensive study\nof LLM fingerprinting. We introduce a unified framework and formal taxonomy\nthat categorizes existing methods into white-box and black-box approaches,\nproviding a structured overview of the state of the art. We further propose\nLeaFBench, the first systematic benchmark for evaluating LLM fingerprinting\nunder realistic deployment scenarios. Built upon mainstream foundation models\nand comprising 149 distinct model instances, LeaFBench integrates 13\nrepresentative post-development techniques, spanning both parameter-altering\nmethods (e.g., fine-tuning, quantization) and parameter-independent mechanisms\n(e.g., system prompts, RAG). Extensive experiments on LeaFBench reveal the\nstrengths and weaknesses of existing methods, thereby outlining future research\ndirections and critical open problems in this emerging field.

However, most DNN-based methods suffer from catastrophic\nforgetting and fail to maintain their performance in previously learned\nscenarios after adapting to new data. Recent continual learning (CL) studies\naim to mitigate this phenomenon by enhancing memory stability of DNN, i.e., the\nability to retain learned knowledge. Yet, excessive emphasis on the memory\nstability often impairs learning plasticity, i.e., the capacity of DNN to\nacquire new information effectively. To address such stability-plasticity\ndilemma, this study proposes a novel CL method, synergetic memory rehearsal\n(SyReM), for DNN-based motion forecasting. SyReM maintains a compact memory\nbuffer to represent learned knowledge. To ensure memory stability, it employs\nan inequality constraint that limits increments in the average loss over the\nmemory buffer. Synergistically, a selective memory rehearsal mechanism is\ndesigned to enhance learning plasticity by selecting samples from the memory\nbuffer that are most similar to recently observed data. This selection is based\non an online-measured cosine similarity of loss gradients, ensuring targeted\nmemory rehearsal. Since replayed samples originate from learned scenarios, this\nmemory rehearsal mechanism avoids compromising memory stability. We validate\nSyReM under an online CL paradigm where training samples from diverse scenarios\narrive as a one-pass stream. Experiments on 11 naturalistic driving datasets\nfrom INTERACTION demonstrate that, compared to non-CL and CL baselines, SyReM\nsignificantly mitigates catastrophic forgetting in past scenarios while\nimproving forecasting accuracy in new ones.

Prior work\ndemonstrates the vulnerability of RAG systems by misleading them into\ngenerating attacker-chosen outputs through poisoning the knowledge base.\nHowever, this paper uncovers that such attacks could be mitigated by the strong\n\\textit{self-correction ability (SCA)} of modern LLMs, which can reject false\ncontext once properly configured. This SCA poses a significant challenge for\nattackers aiming to manipulate RAG systems.\n  In contrast to previous poisoning methods, which primarily target the\nknowledge base, we introduce \\textsc{DisarmRAG}, a new poisoning paradigm that\ncompromises the retriever itself to suppress the SCA and enforce\nattacker-chosen outputs. This compromisation enables the attacker to\nstraightforwardly embed anti-SCA instructions into the context provided to the\ngenerator, thereby bypassing the SCA. To this end, we present a\ncontrastive-learning-based model editing technique that performs localized and\nstealthy edits, ensuring the retriever returns a malicious instruction only for\nspecific victim queries while preserving benign retrieval behavior. To further\nstrengthen the attack, we design an iterative co-optimization framework that\nautomatically discovers robust instructions capable of bypassing prompt-based\ndefenses. We extensively evaluate DisarmRAG across six LLMs and three QA\nbenchmarks. Our results show near-perfect retrieval of malicious instructions,\nwhich successfully suppress SCA and achieve attack success rates exceeding 90\\%\nunder diverse defensive prompts. Also, the edited retriever remains stealthy\nunder several detection methods, highlighting the urgent need for\nretriever-centric defenses.", "AI": {"tldr": "RAG \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c

The\nformer, action planning, is the core capability that dictates an agent's\nperformance. However, prevailing training paradigms employ end-to-end,\nmulti-objective optimization that jointly trains both capabilities. This\nparadigm faces two critical challenges: imbalanced optimization objective\nallocation and scarcity of verifiable data, making it difficult to enhance the\nagent's planning capability. To address these challenges, we propose\nReinforcement Learning with Tool-use Rewards (RLTR), a novel framework that\ndecouples the training process to enable a focused, single-objective\noptimization of the planning module. Crucially, RLTR introduces a reward signal\nbased on tool-use completeness to directly evaluate the quality of tool\ninvocation sequences.

Existing methods often rely on predicted class\nprobabilities (softmax scores) or data similarity metrics. While softmax-based\napproaches benefit from representing predictions on the standard simplex,\ncompressing logits into probabilities leads to information loss. Meanwhile,\nsimilarity-based methods can be computationally expensive and domain-specific,\nlimiting their broader applicability. In this paper, we introduce ALSA (Anchors\nin Logit Space for Accuracy estimation), a novel framework that preserves\nricher information by operating directly in the logit space. Building on\ntheoretical insights and empirical observations, we demonstrate that the\naggregation and distribution of logits exhibit a strong correlation with the\npredictive performance of the model. To exploit this property, ALSA employs an\nanchor-based modeling strategy: multiple learnable anchors are initialized in\nlogit space, each assigned an influence function that captures subtle\nvariations in the logits. This allows ALSA to provide robust and accurate\nperformance estimates across a wide range of distribution shifts. Extensive\nexperiments on vision, language, and graph benchmarks demonstrate ALSA's\nsuperiority over both softmax- and similarity-based baselines. Notably, ALSA's\nrobustness under significant distribution shifts highlights its potential as a\npractical tool for reliable model evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "ALSA\ub294 \ub85c\uadf8\uc787

Personalized federated learning (pFL) has\ngained increasing attention for its ability to address data heterogeneity.\nHowever, most existing pFL methods assume that each client's data follows a\nsingle distribution and learn one client-level personalized model for each\nclient. This assumption often fails in practice, where a single client may\npossess data from multiple sources or domains, resulting in significant\nintra-client heterogeneity and suboptimal performance. To tackle this\nchallenge, we propose pFedBayesPT, a fine-grained instance-wise pFL framework\nbased on visual prompt tuning. Specifically, we formulate instance-wise prompt\ngeneration from a Bayesian perspective and model the prompt posterior as an\nimplicit distribution to capture diverse visual semantics. We derive a\nvariational training objective under the semi-implicit variational inference\nframework. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that\npFedBayesPT consistently outperforms existing pFL methods under both feature\nand label heterogeneity settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5(pFL)\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 pFedBayesPT\uac00 \uc81c\uc548\ub418\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc870\uc815\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uc815\uad50\ud55c \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4 \uc218\uc900\uc758 pFL\uc744 \uc2e4\ud604\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc774 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc73c\ub85c \uc8fc\ubaa9\ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\ub098, \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \ub2e8\uc77c \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \ub530\ub978\ub2e4\uace0 \uac00\uc815\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c\ub85c\ub294 \uc790\uc8fc \uc2e4\ud328\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \ub3d9\uae30\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "method": "Bayesian \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uace0, \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc0ac\ud6c4 \ud655\ub960\uc744 \uc554\ubb35\uc801 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \ubc18\uc554\ubb35\uc801 \ubcc0\ubd84 \ucd94\ub860 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c \ud558\uc5d0 \ubcc0\ubd84 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "pFedBayesPT\ub294 \uae30\uc900 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 pFL \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "pFedBayesPT\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \uc758\ubbf8\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uace0 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc774\uc9c8\uc131\uc744 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5(FL)\uc740 \uc6d0\uc2dc \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uacf5\uac1c\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubd84\uc0b0 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \ud611\ub825\uc801\uc778 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5(pFL)\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc73c\ub85c \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uc8fc\ubaa9\uc744 \ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874\uc758 pFL \ubc29\ubc95 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc740 \uac01 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \ub2e8\uc77c \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \ub530\ub978\ub2e4\uace0 \uac00\uc815\ud558\uace0 \uac01 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \ud558\ub098\uc758 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uc218\uc900 \uac1c\uc778\ud654 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uac00\uc815\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c\ub85c\ub294 \uc2e4\ud328\ud558\uae30\ub3c4 \ud558\uba70, \ub2e8\uc77c \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\uac00 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ucd9c\ucc98 \ub610\ub294 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ubcf4\uc720\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc5b4 \ub0b4\ubd80 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131\uacfc \ube44\ucd5c\uc801 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc870\uc815\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uc815\uad50\ud55c \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4 \uc218\uc900 pFL \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 pFedBayesPT\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Bayesian \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uace0, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \uc758\ubbf8\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc0ac\ud6c4 \ud655\ub960\uc744 \uc554\ubb35\uc801 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubc18\uc554\ubb35\uc801 \ubcc0\ubd84 \ucd94\ub860 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c \ud558\uc5d0 \ubcc0\ubd84 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc900 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 pFedBayesPT\uac00 \ud2b9\uc9d5 \ubc0f \ub808\uc774\ube14 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131 \uc124\uc815 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 pFL \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud568\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Recent\ndata-centric methods like pruning and compression aim to optimize training but\noffer limited theoretical insight into how data properties affect\ngeneralization, especially the data characteristics in sample scaling.\nTraditional perspectives further constrain progress by focusing predominantly\non data quantity and training efficiency, often overlooking structural aspects\nof data quality. In this study, we introduce SCAR, a principled scheme for\ncharacterizing the intrinsic structural properties of datasets across four key\nmeasures: Scale, Coverage, Authenticity, and Richness. Unlike prior\ndata-centric measures, SCAR captures stable characteristics that remain\ninvariant under dataset scaling, providing a robust and general foundation for\ndata understanding. Leveraging these structural properties, we introduce\nFoundation Data-a minimal subset that preserves the generalization behavior of\nthe full dataset without requiring model-specific retraining. We model\nsingle-modality tasks as step functions and estimate the distribution of the\nfoundation data size to capture step-wise generalization bias across modalities\nin the target multi-modal dataset. Finally, we develop a SCAR-guided data\ncompletion strategy based on this generalization bias, which enables efficient,\nmodality-aware expansion of modality-specific characteristics in multimodal\ndatasets. Experiments across diverse multi-modal datasets and model\narchitectures validate the effectiveness of SCAR in predicting data utility and\nguiding data acquisition.

State-of-the-art approaches use rigid, silicon-based wearables,\nwhich, though capable of multitasking, are not optimized for lightweight,\nflexible wear, limiting their practicality for continuous monitoring. In\ncontrast, flexible electronics (FE) offer flexibility and low manufacturing\ncosts, enabling real-time stress monitoring circuits. However, implementing\ncomplex circuits like machine learning (ML) classifiers in FE is challenging\ndue to integration and power constraints. Previous research has explored\nflexible biosensors and ADCs, but classifier design for stress detection\nremains underexplored. This work presents the first comprehensive design space\nexploration of low-power, flexible stress classifiers. We cover various ML\nclassifiers, feature selection, and neural simplification algorithms, with over\n1200 flexible classifiers. To optimize hardware efficiency, fully customized\ncircuits with low-precision arithmetic are designed in each case. Our\nexploration provides insights into designing real-time stress classifiers that\noffer higher accuracy than current methods, while being low-cost, conformable,\nand ensuring low power and compact

We\nprovide some representation formulas for such proximities under different\nassumptions and provide explicit constructions for these cases. The resulting\nmetric framework allows the use of classical tools from metric modeling, such\nas the extension of Lipschitz functions from subspaces of walks, which permits\nextending proximity functions while preserving fundamental properties via the\nmentioned representations.

This is especially true during initialization phase, which\ndominates total simulation time because of large displacements involved and\nassociated kinetic energy. We overcome this bottleneck with a novel generative\npipeline based on 3D diffusion models that directly synthesizes arbitrarily\nlarge granular assemblies in their final and physically realistic\nconfigurations. The approach frames the problem as a 3D generative modeling\ntask, consisting of a two-stage pipeline. First a diffusion model is trained to\ngenerate independent 3D voxel grids representing granular media. Second, a 3D\ninpainting model, adapted from 2D inpainting techniques using masked inputs,\nstitches these grids together seamlessly, enabling synthesis of large samples\nwith physically realistic structure. The inpainting model explores several\nmasking strategies for the inputs to the underlying UNets by training the\nnetwork to infer missing portions of voxel grids from a concatenation of noised\ntensors, masks, and masked tensors as input channels. The model also adapts a\n2D repainting technique of re-injecting noise scheduler output with ground\ntruth to provide a strong guidance to the 3D model. This along with weighted\nlosses ensures long-term coherence over generation of masked regions. Both\nmodels are trained on the same binarized 3D occupancy grids extracted from\nsmall-scale DEM simulations, achieving linear scaling of computational time\nwith respect to sample size. Quantitatively, a 1.2 m long ballasted rail track\nsynthesis equivalent to a 3-hour DEM simulation, was completed under 20\nseconds. The generated voxel grids can also be post-processed to extract grain\ngeometries for DEM-compatibility as well, enabling physically coherent,\nreal-time, scalable granular media synthesis for

In\nthis work, we explore a different goal: building classifiers that are\ninteresting. An ``interesting classifier'' is one that uses unusual or\nunexpected features, even if its accuracy is lower than the best possible\nmodel. For example, predicting room congestion from CO2 levels achieves\nnear-perfect accuracy but is unsurprising. In contrast, predicting room\ncongestion from humidity is less accurate yet more nuanced and intriguing. We\nintroduce EUREKA, a simple framework that selects features according to their\nperceived interestingness. Our method leverages large language models to rank\nfeatures by their interestingness and then builds interpretable classifiers\nusing only the selected interesting features. Across several benchmark\ndatasets, EUREKA consistently identifies features that are non-obvious yet\nstill predictive. For example, in the Occupancy Detection dataset, our method\nfavors humidity over CO2 levels and light intensity, producing classifiers that\nachieve meaningful accuracy while offering insights. In the Twin Papers\ndataset, our method discovers the rule that papers with a colon in the title\nare more likely to be cited in the future.

Existing data-independent methods struggle with performance\nlimitations due to the lack of data-driven guidance. Data-driven approaches\nalso face key challenges: gradient-based methods are computationally expensive,\nlimiting their practicality for merging large expert models, whereas existing\ngradient-free methods often fail to achieve satisfactory results within a\nlimited number of optimization steps. To address these limitations, this paper\nintroduces PSO-Merging, a novel data-driven merging method based on the\nParticle Swarm Optimization (PSO). In this approach, we initialize the particle\nswarm with a pre-trained model, expert models, and sparsified expert models.

The governing system consists of a steady-state\nDarcy flow equation and a time-dependent convection-diffusion equation. Our\napproach solves the Darcy system using FEM and transfers the resulting velocity\nfield to a physics-informed DeepONet, which learns the mapping from source\nfunctions to solute concentration profiles. This modular strategy preserves\nFEM-level accuracy in the flow field while enabling fast inference for\ntransport dynamics. To handle steep gradients induced by sharp sources, we\nintroduce an adaptive sampling strategy for trunk collocation points. Numerical\nexperiments demonstrate that our method is in good agreement with the reference\nsolutions while offering orders of magnitude speedups over traditional solvers,\nmaking it suitable for practical applications in relevant scenarios.\nImplementation of our proposed method is available at\nhttps://github.com/erkara/fem-pi-deeponet.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 FEM\uacfc \ubb3c\ub9ac \uc815\ubcf4 \uae30\ubc18 DeepONet\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc720\uccb4 \uc804\ub2ec \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc815\ud655\ud558\uace0 \ube60\ub978 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc720\ud55c \uc694\uc18c \ubc29\ubc95(FEM)\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub974\uc2dc \ud750\ub984 \ubc29\uc815\uc2dd\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0, \ubb3c\ub9ac \uc815\ubcf4 \uae30\ubc18 DeepONet\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc6d0\ucc9c \ud568\uc218\uc640 \uc6a9\uc9c8 \ub18d\ub3c4 \ud504\ub85c\ud30c\uc77c \uac04\uc758 \ub9e4\ud551\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc218\uce58 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ud574\ubc95\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uba87 \ubc30 \uc18d\ub3c4\uc758 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, \uc2e4\uc81c \uc751\uc6a9\uc5d0 \uc801\ud569\ud568\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubcf8 \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uc720\uccb4 \uc5ed\ud559 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub192\uc740 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc640 \ube60\ub978 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubfb0\uc871\ud558\uace0 \uad6d\uc18c\ud654\ub41c \uac00\uc6b0\uc2dc\uc548 \uc18c\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uacf5\uc131 \ub9e4\uccb4\uc758 \uc720\uccb4 \uc804\uc1a1\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc720\ud55c \uc694\uc18c \ubc29\ubc95(FEM)\uacfc \ubb3c\ub9ac \uc815\ubcf4 \uae30\ubc18 DeepONet\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc9c0\ubc30 \ubc29\uc815\uc2dd \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc815\uc0c1 \uc0c1\ud0dc \ub2e4\ub974\uc2dc \ud750\ub984 \ubc29\uc815\uc2dd\uacfc \uc2dc\uac04 \uc758\uc874\uc801\uc778 \ub300\ub958-\ud655\uc0b0 \ubc29\uc815\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 FEM\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\ub974\uc2dc \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0 \uacb0\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc18d\ub3c4 \ud544\ub4dc\ub97c \ubb3c\ub9ac \uc815\ubcf4 \uae30\ubc18 DeepONet\uc5d0 \uc804\ub2ec\ud558\uc5ec \uc6d0\ucc9c \ud568\uc218\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6a9\uc9c8 \ub18d\ub3c4 \ud504\ub85c\ud30c\uc77c\ub85c\uc758 \ub9e4\ud551\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubaa8\ub4c8 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ud750\ub984 \ud544\ub4dc\uc5d0\uc11c FEM \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc804\uc1a1 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ube60\ub978 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub0a0\uce74\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc18c\uc2a4\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc720\ub3c4\ub41c \uac00\ud30c\ub978 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8\ub97c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud2b8\ub801\ud06c \ub3d9\uc704 \uc810\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc218\uce58 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc740 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ucc38\uc870 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uacfc \uc798 \uc77c\uce58\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ud574\ubc95\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uba87 \ubc30\uc758 \uc18d\ub3c4 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc5ec \uad00\ub828 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uc751\uc6a9\uc5d0 \uc801\ud569\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Though simple latent\ndistributions are commonly used, it has been shown that more sophisticated\ndistributions can improve performance. For instance, recent work has explored\nusing the distributions produced by quantum processors and found empirical\nimprovements. However, when latent space distributions produced by quantum\nprocessors can be expected to improve performance, and whether these\nimprovements are reproducible, are open questions that we investigate in this\nwork. We prove that, under certain conditions, these \"quantum latent\ndistributions\" enable generative models to produce data distributions that\nclassical latent distributions cannot efficiently produce. We also provide\nactionable intuitions to identify when such quantum advantages may arise in\nreal-world settings. We perform benchmarking experiments on both a synthetic\nquantum dataset and the QM9 molecular dataset, using both simulated and real\nphotonic quantum processors. Our results demonstrate that quantum latent\ndistributions can lead to improved generative performance in GANs compared to a\nrange of classical baselines. We also explore diffusion and flow matching\nmodels, identifying architectures compatible with quantum latent distributions.\nThis work confirms that near-term quantum processors can expand the\ncapabilities of deep generative models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc591\uc790 \ucc98\ub9ac\uae30\uac00 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c \uc7a0\uc7ac \ubd84\ud3ec\uac00 \uc0dd\uc131\uc801 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc591\uc790 \ucc98\ub9ac\uae30\uac00 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c \ub354 \uc815\uad50\ud55c \uc7a0\uc7ac \ubd84\ud3ec\uac00 \uc0dd\uc131\uc801 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0 \ud655\uc778\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "\ud569\uc131 \ucffc\ud140 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc640 QM9 \ubd84\uc790 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud0b9 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uace0, \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ubc0f \uc2e4\uc81c \uad11\uc790 \uc591\uc790 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc11c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc591\uc790 \uc7a0\uc7ac \ubd84\ud3ec\uac00 GAN\uc758 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uace0\uc804\uc801\uc778 \uae30\uc900\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uadfc\uac70\ub9ac \uc591\uc790 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc11c\uac00 \uc2ec\uce35 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud655\uc7a5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub9ce\uc740 \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc778 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378 \uacc4\uc5f4\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc5d0 \ub9e4\ud551\ub418\ub294 \uc800\ucc28\uc6d0 \uc7a0\uc7ac \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \uc7a0\uc7ac \ubd84\ud3ec\uac00 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub354 \uc815\uad50\ud55c \ubd84\ud3ec\uac00 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc785\uc99d\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc608\ub97c \ub4e4\uc5b4, \ucd5c\uadfc \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc591\uc790 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc11c\uac00 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801\uc778 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc591\uc790 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc11c\uac00 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c \uc7a0\uc7ac \uacf5\uac04 \ubd84\ud3ec\uac00 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \uae30\ub300\ub418\ub294\uc9c0, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uac1c\uc120\uc774 \uc7ac\ud604 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c\uc9c0 \uc5ec\ubd80\ub294 \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\ub294 \uc5f4\ub824 \uc788\ub294 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc870\uac74\ud558\uc5d0 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c '\uc591\uc790 \uc7a0\uc7ac \ubd84\ud3ec'\uac00 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uace0\uc804\uc801\uc778 \uc7a0\uc7ac \ubd84\ud3ec\uac00 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub610\ud55c \ud604\uc2e4 \uc138\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc591\uc790 \uc774\uc810\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub54c\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c \uc9c1\uad00\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud569\uc131 \ucffc\ud140 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc640 QM9 \ubd84\uc790 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud0b9 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uba70, \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ubc0f \uc2e4\uc81c \uad11\uc790 \uc591\uc790 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc11c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc591\uc790 \uc7a0\uc7ac \ubd84\ud3ec\uac00 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uace0\uc804\uc801\uc778 \uae30\uc900\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 GAN\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0dd\uc131 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub610\ud55c \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ud750\ub984 \ub9e4\uce6d \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\uba70, \uc591\uc790 \uc7a0\uc7ac \ubd84\ud3ec\uc640 \ud638\ud658\ub418\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uac00\uae4c\uc6b4 \ubbf8\ub798\uc758 \uc591\uc790 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc11c\uac00 \uc2ec\uce35 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud655\uc7a5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, mainstream approaches\ngenerally rely on a large number of trainable parameters and fixed aggregation\nrules, making it difficult to adapt to graph data with strong structural\nheterogeneity and complex feature distributions. This often leads to\nover-smoothing of node representations and semantic degradation. To address\nthese issues, this paper proposes a parameter-free graph neural network\nframework based on structural diversity, namely SDGNN (Structural-Diversity\nGraph Neural Network). The framework is inspired by structural diversity theory\nand designs a unified structural-diversity message passing mechanism that\nsimultaneously captures the heterogeneity of neighborhood structures and the\nstability of feature semantics, without introducing additional trainable\nparameters. Unlike traditional parameterized methods, SDGNN does not rely on\ncomplex model training, but instead leverages complementary modeling from both\nstructure-driven and feature-driven perspectives, thereby effectively improving\nadaptability across datasets and scenarios. Experimental results show that on\neight public benchmark datasets and an interdisciplinary PubMed citation\nnetwork, SDGNN consistently outperforms mainstream GNNs under challenging\nconditions such as low supervision, class imbalance, and cross-domain transfer.\nThis work provides a new theoretical perspective and general approach for the\ndesign of parameter-free graph neural networks, and further validates the\nimportance of structural diversity as a core signal in graph representation\nlearning.

Submitted to Elsevier Neurocomputing, under\n  review", "summary": "Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) achieve high accuracy but often\nrely on purely global, gradient-based optimisation, which can lead to\noverfitting, redundant filters, and reduced interpretability. To address these\nlimitations, we propose NM-Hebb, a two-phase training framework that integrates\nneuro-inspired local plasticity with distance-aware supervision. Phase 1\nextends standard supervised training by jointly optimising a cross-entropy\nobjective with two biologically inspired mechanisms: (i) a Hebbian regulariser\nthat aligns the spatial mean of activations with the mean of the corresponding\nconvolutional filter weights, encouraging structured, reusable primitives; and\n(ii) a learnable neuromodulator that gates an elastic-weight-style\nconsolidation loss, preserving beneficial parameters without freezing the\nnetwork. Phase 2 fine-tunes the backbone with a pairwise metric-learning loss,\nexplicitly compressing intra-class distances and enlarging inter-class margins\nin the embedding space. Evaluated on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet\nacross five backbones (ResNet-18, VGG-11, MobileNet-v2, EfficientNet-V2,\nDenseNet-121), NM-Hebb achieves consistent gains over baseline and other\nmethods: Top-1 accuracy improves by +2.0-10.0 pp (CIFAR-10), +2.0-9.0 pp\n(CIFAR-100), and up to +4.3-8.9 pp (TinyImageNet), with Normalised Mutual\nInformation (NMI) increased by up to +0.15.

To appear in EMNLP'25", "summary": "This paper introduces an algorithm to select demonstration examples for\nin-context learning of a query set. Given a set of $n$ examples, how can we\nquickly select $k$ out of $n$ to best serve as the conditioning for downstream\ninference? This problem has broad applications in prompt tuning and\nchain-of-thought reasoning. Since model weights remain fixed during in-context\nlearning, previous work has sought to design methods based on the similarity of\ntoken embeddings. This work proposes a new approach based on gradients of the\noutput taken in the input embedding space. Our approach estimates model outputs\nthrough a first-order approximation using the gradients. Then, we apply this\nestimation to multiple randomly sampled subsets. Finally, we aggregate the\nsampled subset outcomes to form an influence score for each demonstration, and\nselect $k$ most relevant examples. This procedure only requires pre-computing\nmodel outputs and gradients once, resulting in a linear-time algorithm relative\nto model and training set sizes. Extensive experiments across various models\nand datasets validate the efficiency of our approach. We show that the gradient\nestimation procedure yields approximations of full inference with less than\n$\\mathbf{1}\\%$ error across six datasets.

Paper accepted to CIKM 2025", "summary": "Given a signed bipartite graph (SBG) G with two disjoint node sets U and V,\nthe goal of link sign prediction is to predict the signs of potential links\nconnecting U and V based on known positive and negative edges in G. The\nmajority of existing solutions towards link sign prediction mainly focus on\nunipartite signed graphs, which are sub-optimal due to the neglect of node\nheterogeneity and unique bipartite characteristics of SBGs. To this end, recent\nstudies adapt graph neural networks to SBGs by introducing message-passing\nschemes for both inter-partition (UxV) and intra-partition (UxU or VxV) node\npairs. However, the fundamental spectral convolutional operators were\noriginally designed for positive links in unsigned graphs, and thus, are not\noptimal for inferring missing positive or negative links from known ones in\nSBGs.\n  Motivated by this, this paper proposes GegenNet, a novel and effective\nspectral convolutional neural network model for link sign prediction in SBGs.\nIn particular, GegenNet achieves enhanced model capacity and high predictive\naccuracy through three main technical contributions: (i) fast and theoretically\ngrounded spectral decomposition techniques for node feature initialization;\n(ii) a new spectral graph filter based on the Gegenbauer polynomial basis; and\n(iii) multi-layer sign-aware spectral convolutional networks alternating\nGegenbauer polynomial filters with positive and negative edges. Our extensive\nempirical studies reveal that GegenNet can achieve significantly superior\nperformance (up to a gain of 4.28% in AUC and 11.69% in F1) in link sign\nprediction compared to 11 strong competitors over 6 benchmark SBG datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc774\ubd84 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc758 \ub9c1\ud06c \uae30\ud638 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud55c

Using a dataset of 271,700 products from 40\ninternational fashion e-commerce platforms, we integrate textual features\n(RoBERTa), visual features (ViT), and joint vision--language representations\n(CLIP). We investigate fusion strategies, including early, late, and\nattention-based fusion within a hierarchical architecture enhanced by dynamic\nmasking to ensure taxonomic consistency. Results show that CLIP embeddings\ncombined via an MLP-based late-fusion strategy achieve the highest hierarchical\nF1 (98.59\\%), outperforming unimodal baselines. To address shallow or\ninconsistent categories, we further introduce a self-supervised ``product\nrecategorization'' pipeline using SimCLR, UMAP, and cascade clustering, which\ndiscovered new, fine-grained categories (e.g., subtypes of ``Shoes'') with\ncluster purities above 86\\%. Cross-platform experiments reveal a\ndeployment-relevant trade-off: complex late-fusion methods maximize accuracy\nwith diverse training data, while simpler early-fusion methods generalize more\neffectively to unseen platforms. Finally, we demonstrate the framework's\nindustrial scalability through deployment in EURWEB's commercial transaction\nintelligence platform via a two-stage inference pipeline, combining

Most existing methods rely on\ncomparing high-dimensional text embeddings from models like CLIP or CXR-BERT,\nwhich are often difficult to interpret, computationally expensive, and not\nwell-aligned with the structured nature of medical knowledge. We propose a\nnovel, ontology-driven alternative for comparing radiology report texts based\non clinically grounded concepts from the Unified Medical Language System\n(UMLS). Our method extracts standardised medical entities from free-text\nreports using an enhanced pipeline built on RadGraph-XL and SapBERT. These\nentities are linked to UMLS concepts (CUIs), enabling a transparent,\ninterpretable set-based representation of each report. We then define a\ntask-adaptive similarity measure based on a modified and weighted version of\nthe Tversky Index that accounts for synonymy, negation, and hierarchical\nrelationships between medical entities. This allows efficient and semantically\nmeaningful similarity comparisons between reports. We demonstrate that our\napproach outperforms state-of-the-art embedding-based retrieval methods in a\nradiograph classification task on MIMIC-CXR, particularly in long-tail\nsettings. Additionally, we use our pipeline to generate ontology-backed disease\nlabels for MIMIC-CXR, offering a valuable new resource for downstream learning\ntasks. Our work provides more explainable, reliable, and task-specific\nretrieval strategies in clinical AI systems, especially when interpretability\nand domain knowledge integration are essential.

To understand when and how\nthis emergent misalignment occurs, we develop a comprehensive framework for\ndetecting and characterizing rapid transitions during fine-tuning using both\ndistributional change detection methods as well as order parameters that are\nformulated in plain English and evaluated by an LLM judge. Using an objective\nstatistical dissimilarity measure, we quantify how the phase transition that\noccurs during fine-tuning affects multiple aspects of the model. In particular,\nwe assess what percentage of the total distributional change in model outputs\nis captured by different aspects, such as alignment or verbosity, providing a\ndecomposition of the overall transition. We also find that the actual\nbehavioral transition occurs later in training than indicated by the peak in\nthe gradient norm alone.

To address these challenges, we propose\nFlowletFormer, a BERT-based pre-training model specifically designed for\nnetwork traffic analysis. FlowletFormer introduces a Coherent Behavior-Aware\nTraffic Representation Model for segmenting traffic into semantically\nmeaningful units, a Protocol Stack Alignment-Based Embedding Layer to capture\nmultilayer protocol semantics, and Field-Specific and Context-Aware Pretraining\nTasks to enhance both inter-packet and inter-flow learning. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that FlowletFormer significantly outperforms existing\nmethods in the effectiveness of traffic representation, classification\naccuracy, and few-shot learning capability. Moreover, by effectively\nintegrating domain-specific network knowledge, FlowletFormer shows better\ncomprehension of the principles of network transmission (e.g., stateful\nconnections of TCP), providing a more robust and trustworthy framework for\ntraffic analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "FlowletFormer\ub294 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ud2b8\ub798\ud53d \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c BERT \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c, \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc774 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c \ud328\ud0b7 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uacfc \ud750\ub984 \uc218\uc900 \ud589\ub3d9, \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c \uc758\ubbf8, \uc0c1\ud638 \ud328\ud0b7 \ub9e5\ub77d \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc811\uadfc\ud558\uc5ec \ud2b8\ub798\ud53d \ub300\ud45c\uc131 \ubc0f \ubd84\ub958 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ud2b8\ub798\ud53d \ubd84\ub958 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ud328\ud0b7 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uacfc \ud750\ub984 \uc218\uc900 \ud589\ub3d9 \ub4f1\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uc74c\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud568.", "method": "FlowletFormer\ub294 BERT \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c, \ud2b8\ub798\ud53d\uc744 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc788\ub294 \ub2e8\uc704\ub85c \uc138\ubd84\ud654\ud558\ub294 Coherent Behavior-Aware Traffic Representation Model, \ub2e4\uce35 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c \uc758\ubbf8\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 Protocol Stack Alignment-Based Embedding Layer, \uc0c1\ud638 \ud328\ud0b7 \ubc0f \uc0c1\ud638 \ud750\ub984 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud558\ub294 Field-Specific and Context-Aware Pretraining Tasks\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud568.", "result": "FlowletFormer\ub294 \ud2b8\ub798\ud53d \ub300\ud45c\uc131, \ubd84\ub958 \uc815\ud655\uc131 \ubc0f \uba87 \ubc88\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5 \ub2a5\ub825\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ucd08\uc6d4\ud568\uc744 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90c.", "conclusion": "FlowletFormer\ub294 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\ud654\ub41c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec TCP\uc758 \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc720\uc9c0 \uc5f0\uacb0\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uc804\uc1a1 \uc6d0\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc774\ud574\ub3c4\ub97c \ub192\uc774\uba70, \ud2b8\ub798\ud53d \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uac15\ub825\ud558\uace0 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud568.", "translated_summary": "\uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ud2b8\ub798\ud53d \ubd84\ub958\ub294 \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc600\uc73c\ub098, \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \ud328\ud0b7 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ud2b9\uc9d5, \ud750\ub984 \uc218\uc900 \ud589\ub3d9, \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c \uc758\ubbf8 \ubc0f \uc0c1\ud638 \ud328\ud0b7 \ub9e5\ub77d \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ud2b8\ub798\ud53d \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ud2b9\ubcc4\ud788 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c BERT \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubaa8\ub378\uc778 FlowletFormer\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

After\nstandardizing each segment to a permutation and computing the frequency\ndistribution of these permutations, Shannon Entropy is then applied to quantify\nthe series' complexity. We introduce Global Permutation Entropy (GPE), a novel\nindex that considers all possible patterns of a given length, including\nnon-consecutive ones.

Two lookback\nperiods, 60 minutes and 120 minutes, were evaluated using a sliding window\napproach. For each window, statistical features including mean, standard\ndeviation, minimum, maximum, and linear trend were extracted, and class\nimbalance was addressed using the SMOTE algorithm.

Results show that\nthe Random Forest model achieved the best short-term forecasting performance\nwith a 60-minute window, reaching recall scores of 69.2\\% at 5 minutes, 64.9\\%\nat 15 minutes, and 48.6\\% at 30 minutes. With a 120-minute window, the Random\nForest model achieved 57.6\\% recall at 5 minutes, and improved predictive\naccuracy of 65.6\\% at both 15 and 30 minutes.

Like many other problems, real-time assistants based on mobile\nphones have been proposed, but their effectiveness is understudied. This work\nquantifies how varying levels of user coordination and information availability\nthrough such apps impact search time and the probability of finding street\nparking. Through a data-driven simulation of Madrid's street parking ecosystem,\nwe analyze four distinct strategies: uncoordinated search (Unc-Agn),\ncoordinated parking without awareness of non-users (Cord-Agn), an idealized\noracle system that knows the positions of all non-users (Cord-Oracle), and our\nnovel/practical Cord-Approx strategy that estimates non-users' behavior\nprobabilistically. The Cord-Approx strategy, instead of requiring knowledge of\nhow close non-users are to a certain spot in order to decide whether to\nnavigate toward it, uses past occupancy distributions to elongate physical\ndistances between system users and alternative parking spots, and then solves a\nHungarian matching problem to dispatch accordingly. In high-fidelity\nsimulations of Madrid's parking network with real traffic data, users of\nCord-Approx averaged 6.69 minutes to find parking, compared to 19.98 minutes\nfor non-users without an app. A zone-level snapshot shows that Cord-Approx\nreduces search time for system users by 72% (range = 67-76%) in central hubs,\nand up to 73% in residential areas, relative to non-users.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c \uc571\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc8fc\ucc28\ub97c \ucc3e\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uad50\ud1b5 \ud63c\uc7a1\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0, \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \uc804\ub7b5\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ube44\uad50\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubc00\uc9d1\ub41c \ub3c4\uc2dc \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c \uac70\ub9ac \uc8fc\ucc28 \uac80\uc0c9\uc740 \uad50\ud1b5 \ud63c\uc7a1\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \ubcf4\uc870 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uacfc \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub9c8\ub4dc\ub9ac\ub4dc\uc758 \uac70\ub9ac \uc8fc\ucc28 \uc0dd\ud0dc\uacc4\ub97c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0, \ube44\uc870\uc815 \uac80\uc0c9, \ube44\uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc778\uc2dd \uc5c6\uc774 \uc870\uc815\ub41c \uc8fc\ucc28, \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ube44\uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc758 \uc704\uce58\ub97c \uc544\ub294 \uc774\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \uc624\ub77c\ud074 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c, \ubc0f \ube44\uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud655\ub960\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 Cord-Approx \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ube44\uad50\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "Cord-Approx \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\ub4e4\uc740 \ud3c9\uade0 6.69\ubd84\ub9cc\uc5d0 \uc8fc\ucc28\ub97c \ucc3e\ub294 \ubc18\uba74, \uc571\uc774 \uc5c6\ub294 \ube44\uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\ub294 \ud3c9\uade0 19.98\ubd84\uc774 \uac78\ub838\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uc911 \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 Cord-Approx\uac00 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uac80\uc0c9 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 72% \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ucf30\uc73c\uba70, \uc8fc\uac70\uc9c0\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ucd5c\ub300 73%\uae4c\uc9c0 \uac10\uc18c\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Cord-Approx \uc804\ub7b5\uc740 \ube44\uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc758 \uc8fc\ucc28 \uac80\uc0c9 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ub2e8\ucd95\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubc00\uc9d1\ub41c \ub3c4\uc2dc \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c \uac70\ub9ac \uc8fc\ucc28 \uac80\uc0c9\uc740 \uad50\ud1b5 \ud63c\uc7a1\uc744 \uac00\uc911\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9ce\uc740 \ub2e4\ub978 \ubb38\uc81c\ub4e4\ucc98\ub7fc, \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c \ud3f0\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \ubcf4\uc870 \ub3c4\uad6c\uac00 \uc81c\uc548\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\ub098, \uadf8 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub294 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc571\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc870\uc815\uacfc \uc815\ubcf4 \uac00\uc6a9\uc131\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc218\uc900\uc774 \uac80\uc0c9 \uc2dc\uac04\uacfc \uac70\ub9ac \uc8fc\ucc28 \ubc1c\uacac \ud655\ub960\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9c8\ub4dc\ub9ac\ub4dc\uc758 \uac70\ub9ac \uc8fc\ucc28 \uc0dd\ud0dc\uacc4\ub97c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uba70, \ube44\uc870\uc815 \uac80\uc0c9(Unc-Agn), \ube44\uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\ub97c \uc778\uc2dd\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \uc870\uc815\ub41c \uc8fc\ucc28(Cord-Agn), \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ube44\uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc758 \uc704\uce58\ub97c \uc544\ub294 \uc774\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \uc624\ub77c\ud074 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(Cord-Oracle), \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \ube44\uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud655\ub960\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 Cord-Approx \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

To this end, we study whether language models\nexhibit contextual robustness, or the capability to adhere to context-dependent\nsafety specifications. For this analysis, we develop a benchmark (PasswordEval)\nthat measures whether language models can correctly determine when a user\nrequest is authorized (i.e., with a correct password). We find that current\nopen- and closed-source models struggle with this seemingly simple task, and\nthat, perhaps surprisingly, reasoning capabilities do not generally improve\nperformance. In fact, we find that reasoning traces frequently leak\nconfidential information, which calls into question whether reasoning traces\nshould be exposed to users in such applications. We also scale the difficulty\nof our evaluation along multiple axes: (i) by adding adversarial user pressure\nthrough various jailbreaking strategies, and (ii) through longer multi-turn\nconversations where password verification is more challenging. Overall, our\nresults suggest that current frontier models are not well-suited to handling\nconfidential information, and that reasoning capabilities may need to be\ntrained in a different manner to make them safer for release in high-stakes\nsettings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uace0\uc704\ud5d8 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c

In this paper, we propose a new self-supervised pre-training approach\nto dealing with heterogeneous data. Instead of mixing all the data and\nminimizing the averaged global loss in the conventional way, we impose\nadditional equilibrium constraints to ensure that the models optimizes each\nsource of heterogeneous data to its local optima after $K$-step gradient\ndescent initialized from the model. We formulate this as a bilevel optimization\nproblem, and use the first-order approximation method to solve the problem. We\ndiscuss its connection to model-agnostic meta learning (MAML).

Such emails contain personalized recommendations\ntailored to each user's interests, enticing users to buy relevant items. A\ncommon limitation of these emails is that the primary entry point, the title of\nthe email, tends to follow fixed templates, failing to inspire enough interest\nin the contents.

Although such models are routinely fine-tuned for\ndownstream NLP tasks, recent work shows they remain vulnerable to backdoor\nattacks that survive vanilla fine-tuning. These attacks are difficult to defend\nbecause end users typically lack knowledge of the attack triggers. Such attacks\nconsist of stealthy malicious triggers introduced through subtle syntactic or\nstylistic manipulations, which can bypass traditional detection and remain in\nthe model, making post-hoc purification essential. In this study, we explore\nwhether attention-head pruning can mitigate these threats without any knowledge\nof the trigger or access to a clean reference model. To this end, we design and\nimplement six pruning-based strategies: (i) gradient-based pruning, (ii)\nlayer-wise variance pruning, (iii) gradient-based pruning with structured L1/L2\nsparsification, (iv) randomized ensemble pruning, (v)\nreinforcement-learning-guided pruning, and (vi) Bayesian uncertainty pruning.\nEach method iteratively removes the least informative heads while monitoring\nvalidation accuracy to avoid over-pruning. Experimental evaluation shows that\ngradient-based pruning performs best while defending the syntactic triggers,\nwhereas reinforcement learning and Bayesian pruning better withstand

This paper\nanalyzes FDS's properties, showing that minimizing the size of its search tree\nguided by ranked branching decisions is closely related to the Multi-armed\nbandit (MAB) problem. Building on this insight, MAB reinforcement learning\nalgorithms are applied to FDS, extended with problem-specific refinements and\nparameter tuning, and evaluated on the two most fundamental scheduling\nproblems, the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) and Resource-Constrained\nProject Scheduling Problem (RCPSP). The resulting enhanced FDS, using the best\nextended MAB algorithm and configuration, performs 1.7 times faster on the JSSP\nand 2.1 times faster on the RCPSP benchmarks compared to the original\nimplementation in a new solver called OptalCP, while also being 3.5 times\nfaster on the JSSP and 2.1 times faster on the RCPSP benchmarks than the\ncurrent state-of-the-art FDS algorithm in IBM CP Optimizer 22.1. Furthermore,\nusing only a 900-second time limit per instance, the enhanced FDS improved the\nexisting state-of-the-art lower bounds of 78 of 84 JSSP and 226 of 393 RCPSP\nstandard open benchmark instances while also completely closing a few of them.", "AI": {"tldr": "FDS\ub294 \uc81c\uc57d \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\ub9c1 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc644\uc804 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc774\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 FDS\uc758 \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0, MAB \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 FDS\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc JSSP\uc640 RCPSP\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\uc5c8\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "motivation": "FDS \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud558\uba70, MAB \ubb38\uc81c\uc640\uc758 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uc774\ud574\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "FDS\uc758 \ubd84\uae30\ub97c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 MAB \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uace0 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ud2b9\ud654\ub41c \uac1c\uc120 \ubc0f \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\uac15\ud654\ub41c FDS\ub294 JSSP\uc5d0\uc11c 1.7\ubc30, RCPSP\uc5d0\uc11c 2.1\ubc30\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 FDS \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\ubcf4\ub2e4\ub3c4 \ub354 \ube60\ub978 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uac15\ud654\ub41c FDS\ub294 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud558\ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0, \uba87 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uc644\uc804\ud788 \ud574\uacb0\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc2e4\ud328 \uc9c0\ud5a5 \ud0d0\uc0c9(FDS)\uc740 \uc81c\uc57d \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d(CP)\uc5d0\uc11c \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud558\uace0 \uc644\uc804\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc73c\ub85c, \ud2b9\ud788 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\ub9c1 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc784\uc774 \uc785\uc99d\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 FDS\uc758 \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0, \uc21c\uc704\ubcc4 \ubd84\uae30 \uacb0\uc815\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uac00\uc774\ub4dc\ub41c \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ud2b8\ub9ac \ud06c\uae30 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\uac00 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubb34\uc7a5 \uac15\ub3c4 \ubb38\uc81c(MAB \ubb38\uc81c)\uc640 \ubc00\uc811\ud55c \uad00\ub828\uc774 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c MAB \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc774 FDS\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \ubb38\uc81c\ubcc4 \uac1c\uc120\uacfc \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \ud29c\ub2dd\uc774 \ud655\uc7a5\ub418\uc5b4 \uc9c1\ubb34 \uc0f5 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\ub9c1 \ubb38\uc81c(JSSP)\uc640 \uc790\uc6d0 \uc81c\uc57d \ud504\ub85c\uc81d\ud2b8 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\ub9c1 \ubb38\uc81c(RCPSP)\ub77c\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uae30\ubcf8 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\ub9c1 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uc0c1\uc758 \ud655\uc7a5 MAB \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \ubc0f \uad6c\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uac15\ud654\ub41c FDS\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud574\uacb0\uae30\uc778 OptalCP\uc758 \uc6d0\ub798 \uad6c\ud604\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 JSSP\uc5d0\uc11c 1.7\ubc30, RCPSP\uc5d0\uc11c 2.1\ubc30 \ube60\ub978 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc73c\uba70, IBM CP Optimizer 22.1\uc758 \ud604\uc7ac \ucca8\ub2e8 FDS \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\ubcf4\ub2e4\ub3c4 JSSP\uc5d0\uc11c 3.5\ubc30, RCPSP\uc5d0\uc11c 2.1\ubc30 \ub354 \ube60\ub974\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4\ub2f9 900\ucd08\uc758 \uc2dc\uac04 \ud55c\ub3c4\ub9cc\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac15\ud654\ub41c FDS\ub294 84\uac1c\uc758 JSSP\uc640 393\uac1c\uc758 RCPSP \ud45c\uc900 \uacf5\uac1c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4 \uc911 78\uac1c\uc640 226\uac1c\uc758 \uae30\uc874 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ud558\ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0, \uba87 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uc644\uc804\ud788 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uc600\ub2e4."}}
