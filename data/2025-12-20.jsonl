Owing to their unique combination of efficiency, scalability, and expressive capacity, SSMs have become compelling alternatives to transformer-based models, which suffer from the quadratic computational and memory costs of attention mechanisms. As SSMs are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, it is critical to assess their susceptibility to both software- and hardware-level threats to ensure secure and reliable operation. Among such threats, hardware-induced bit-flip attacks (BFAs) pose a particularly severe risk by corrupting model parameters through memory faults, thereby undermining model accuracy and functional integrity. To investigate this vulnerability, we introduce RAMBO, the first BFA framework specifically designed to target Mamba-based architectures. Through experiments on the Mamba-1.4b model with LAMBADA benchmark, a cloze-style word-prediction task, we demonstrate that flipping merely a single critical bit can catastrophically reduce accuracy from 74.64% to 0% and increase perplexity from 18.94 to 3.75 x 10^6. These results demonstrate the pronounced fragility of SSMs to adversarial perturbations."}

As cyber threats grow increasingly sophisticated, NIDS must evolve to detect both emerging threats and deviations from normal behavior. This study explores the application of machine learning (ML) methods to improve the NIDS accuracy through analyzing intricate structures in deep-featured network traffic records. Leveraging the 1999 KDD CUP intrusion dataset as a benchmark, this research evaluates and optimizes several ML algorithms, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naïve Bayes variants (MNB, BNB), Random Forest (RF), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Decision Trees (DT), AdaBoost, XGBoost, Logistic Regression (LR), Ridge Classifier, Passive-Aggressive (PA) Classifier, Rocchio Classifier, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Perceptron (PPN). Initial evaluations without hyper-parameter optimization demonstrated suboptimal performance, highlighting the importance of tuning to enhance classification accuracy. After hyper-parameter optimization using grid and random search techniques, the SVM classifier achieved 99.12% accuracy with a 0.0091 False Alarm Rate (FAR), outperforming its default configuration (98.08% accuracy, 0.0123 FAR) and all other classifiers. This result confirms that SVM accomplishes the highest accuracy among the evaluated classifiers. We validated the effectiveness of all classifiers using a tenfold cross-validation approach, incorporating Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) for feature selection to enhance the classifiers accuracy and efficiency. Our outcomes indicate that ML classifiers are both adaptable and reliable, contributing to enhanced accuracy in systems for detecting network intrusions."}

Modern MAS are inherently heterogeneous, integrating conventional Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) with emerging Large Language Model (LLM) agent architectures utilizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). A critical shared vulnerability is reliance on centralized memory components: the shared Experience Replay (ER) buffer in MARL and the external Knowledge Base (K) in RAG agents. This paper proposes XAMT (Bilevel Optimization for Covert Memory Tampering in Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Architectures), a novel framework that formalizes attack generation as a bilevel optimization problem. The Upper Level minimizes perturbation magnitude (delta) to enforce covertness while maximizing system behavior divergence toward an adversary-defined target (Lower Level). We provide rigorous mathematical instantiations for CTDE MARL algorithms and RAG-based LLM agents, demonstrating that bilevel optimization uniquely crafts stealthy, minimal-perturbation poisons evading detection heuristics. Comprehensive experimental protocols utilize SMAC and SafeRAG benchmarks to quantify effectiveness at sub-percent poison rates (less than or equal to 1 percent in MARL, less than or equal to 0.1 percent in RAG). XAMT defines a new unified class of training-time threats essential for developing intrinsically secure MAS, with implications for trust, formal verification, and defensive strategies prioritizing intrinsic safety over perimeter-based detection."}

However, the openness and heterogeneity of LLM-based multi-agent systems also amplify the risks of deception, fraud, and misinformation, posing severe challenges to trust establishment and system robustness. To address this issue, we propose Ev-Trust, a strategy-equilibrium trust mechanism grounded in evolutionary game theory. This mechanism integrates direct trust, indirect trust, and expected revenue into a dynamic feedback structure that guides agents' behavioral evolution toward equilibria. Within a decentralized \"Request-Response-Payment-Evaluation\" service framework, Ev-Trust enables agents to adaptively adjust strategies, naturally excluding malicious participants while reinforcing high-quality collaboration. Furthermore, our theoretical derivation based on replicator dynamics equations proves the existence and stability of local evolutionary equilibria. Experimental results indicate that our approach effectively reflects agent trustworthiness in LLM-driven open service interaction scenarios, reduces malicious strategies, and increases collective revenue. We hope Ev-Trust can provide a new perspective on trust modeling for the agentic service web in group evolutionary game scenarios."}

We evaluated 13 experiments spanning fundamental optics (Hong-Ou-Mandel interference, Michelson/Mach-Zehnder interferometry, Bell states, delayed-choice quantum eraser), quantum information protocols (BB84 QKD, Franson interferometry, GHZ states, quantum teleportation, hyperentanglement), and advanced technologies (boson sampling, electromagnetically induced transparency, frequency conversion).

Trusted for their ability to act without direct oversight, such agents are increasingly considered in high-stakes domains including financial management, dispute resolution, and governance. Yet in practice, agents execute on infrastructure controlled by a host, who can tamper with models, inputs, or outputs, undermining any meaningful notion of autonomy.\n  We address this gap by introducing VET (Verifiable Execution Traces), a formal framework that achieves host-independent authentication of agent outputs and takes a step toward host-independent autonomy. Central to VET is the Agent Identity Document (AID), which specifies an agent's configuration together with the proof systems required for verification. VET is compositional: it supports multiple proof mechanisms, including trusted hardware, succinct cryptographic proofs, and notarized TLS transcripts (Web Proofs).\n  We implement VET for an API-based LLM agent and evaluate our instantiation on realistic workloads. We find that for today's black-box, secret-bearing API calls, Web Proofs appear to be the most practical choice, with overhead typically under 3$\\times$ compared to direct API calls, while for public API calls, a lower-overhead TEE Proxy is often sufficient. As a case study, we deploy a verifiable trading agent that produces proofs for each decision and composes Web Proofs with a TEE Proxy. Our results demonstrate that practical, host-agnostic authentication is already possible with current technology, laying the foundation for future systems that achieve full host-independent autonomy."}

Various multi-view support vector machine (MvSVM) approaches have been developed, demonstrating significant success. Moreover, these models face challenges in effectively capturing decision boundaries in high-dimensional spaces using the kernel trick. They are also prone to errors and struggle with view inconsistencies, which are common in multi-view datasets. In this work, we introduce the multiview twin restricted kernel machine (TMvRKM), a novel model that integrates the strengths of kernel machines with the multiview framework, addressing key computational and generalization challenges associated with traditional kernel-based approaches. Unlike traditional methods that rely on solving large quadratic programming problems (QPPs), the proposed TMvRKM efficiently determines an optimal separating hyperplane through a regularized least squares approach, enhancing both computational efficiency and classification performance. The primal objective of TMvRKM includes a coupling term designed to balance errors across multiple views effectively. By integrating early and late fusion strategies, TMvRKM leverages the collective information from all views during training while remaining flexible to variations specific to individual views. The proposed TMvRKM model is rigorously tested on UCI, KEEL, and AwA benchmark datasets. Both experimental results and statistical analyses consistently highlight its exceptional generalization performance, outperforming baseline models in every scenario."}

This paper introduces the Principle of Proportional Duty (PPD), a novel framework that models how ethical responsibility scales with an agent's epistemic state. The framework reveals that moral duty is not lost to uncertainty but transforms: as uncertainty increases, Action Duty (the duty to act decisively) is proportionally converted into Repair Duty (the active duty to verify, inquire, and resolve uncertainty).\n  This dynamic is expressed by the equation D_total = K[(1-HI) + HI * g(C_signal)], where Total Duty is a function of Knowledge (K), Humility/Uncertainty (HI), and Contextual Signal Strength (C_signal). Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that systems maintaining a baseline humility coefficient (lambda > 0) produce more stable duty allocations and reduce the risk of overconfident decision-making.\n  By formalizing humility as a system parameter, the PPD offers a mathematically tractable approach to moral responsibility that could inform the development of auditable AI decision systems. This paper applies the framework across four domains, clinical ethics, recipient-rights law, economic governance, and artificial intelligence, to demonstrate its cross-disciplinary validity. The findings suggest that proportional duty serves as a stabilizing principle within complex systems, preventing both overreach and omission by dynamically balancing epistemic confidence against contextual risk."}

Our findings show that LLMs are already widely deployed within scam organizations, with 87% of scam labor consisting of systematized conversational tasks readily susceptible to automation. In a week-long study, an LLM agent not only elicited greater trust from study participants (p=0.007) but also achieved higher compliance with requests than human operators (46% vs. 18% for humans). Meanwhile, popular safety filters detected 0.0% of romance baiting dialogues. Together, these results suggest that romance-baiting scams may be amenable to full-scale LLM automation, while existing defenses remain inadequate to prevent their expansion."}

We provide the first systematic study of this risk. First, we establish a formal framework, attributing the risk's root cause to the agent's misaligned objective function: an overoptimization for helpfulness while neglecting privacy awareness. Second, we construct TOP-Bench, comprising paired leakage and benign scenarios, to comprehensively evaluate this risk. To quantify the trade-off between safety and robustness, we introduce the H-Score as a holistic metric. The evaluation results reveal that TOP-R is a severe risk: the average Risk Leakage Rate (RLR) of eight representative models reaches 90.24%, while the average H-Score is merely 0.167, with no model exceeding 0.3. Finally, we propose the Privacy Enhancement Principle (PEP) method, which effectively mitigates TOP-R, reducing the Risk Leakage Rate to 46.58% and significantly improving the H-Score to 0.624.

The approach combines classical dimensional analysis with modern machine learning techniques. Starting from measurements of physical quantities, the method identifies the fundamental ways to combine variables into dimensionless groups, then uses neural networks to discover which combinations best predict the experimental output. A key innovation is a regularization technique that encourages the learned coefficients to take simple, interpretable values like integers or half-integers, making the discovered laws both accurate and physically meaningful. We systematically investigate how measurement noise and discrete sampling affect the discovery process, demonstrating that the regularization approach provides robustness to experimental uncertainties.

However, current model-centric agent architectures struggle to self-evolve post-deployment: improving personalization, capability, and efficiency typically requires continuous model retraining/fine-tuning, which incurs prohibitive computational overheads and suffers from an inherent trade-off between model accuracy and inference efficiency.\n  To enable iterative self-evolution without model retraining, we propose MOBIMEM, a memory-centric agent system. MOBIMEM first introduces three specialized memory primitives to decouple agent evolution from model weights: (1) Profile Memory uses a lightweight distance-graph (DisGraph) structure to align with user preferences, resolving the accuracy-latency trade-off in user profile retrieval; (2) Experience Memory employs multi-level templates to instantiate execution logic for new tasks, ensuring capability generalization; and (3) Action Memory records fine-grained interaction sequences, reducing the reliance on expensive model inference. Building upon this memory architecture, MOBIMEM further integrates a suite of OS-inspired services to orchestrate execution: a scheduler that coordinates parallel sub-task execution and memory operations; an agent record-and-replay (AgentRR) mechanism that enables safe and efficient action reuse; and a context-aware exception handling that ensures graceful recovery from user interruptions and runtime errors.\n  Evaluation on AndroidWorld and top-50 apps shows that MOBIMEM achieves 83.1% profile alignment with 23.83 ms retrieval time (280x faster than GraphRAG baselines), improves task success rates by up to 50.3%, and reduces end-to-end latency by up to 9x on mobile devices."}

In traditional adversarial settings, code obfuscation has long been used as a general strategy to bypass auditing tools, preserving exploitability without tampering with the tools themselves. Numerous efforts have explored obfuscation methods and tools, yet their capabilities differ in terms of supported techniques, granularity, and programming languages, making it difficult to systematically assess their impact on LLM-based vulnerability detection. To address this gap, we provide a structured systematization of obfuscation techniques and evaluate them under a unified framework. Specifically, we categorize existing obfuscation methods into three major classes (layout, data flow, and control flow) covering 11 subcategories and 19 concrete techniques. We implement these techniques across four programming languages (Solidity, C, C++, and Python) using a consistent LLM-driven approach, and evaluate their effects on 15 LLMs spanning four model families (DeepSeek, OpenAI, Qwen, and LLaMA), as well as on two coding agents (GitHub Copilot and Codex). Our findings reveal both positive and negative impacts of code obfuscation on LLM-based vulnerability detection, highlighting conditions under which obfuscation leads to performance improvements or degradations. We further analyze these outcomes with respect to vulnerability characteristics, code properties, and model attributes. Finally, we outline several open problems and propose future directions to enhance the robustness of LLMs for real-world vulnerability detection."}

These scenarios are central to multimodal audio-video understanding, where models must jointly reason over audio and visual streams in applications such as conversational video assistants and meeting analytics. We introduce AMUSE, a benchmark designed around tasks that are inherently agentic, requiring models to decompose complex audio-visual interactions into planning, grounding, and reflection steps. It evaluates MLLMs across three modes zero-shot, guided, and agentic and six task families, including spatio-temporal speaker grounding and multimodal dialogue summarization. Across all modes, current models exhibit weak multi-speaker reasoning and inconsistent behavior under both non-agentic and agentic evaluation. Motivated by the inherently agentic nature of these tasks and recent advances in LLM agents, we propose RAFT, a data-efficient agentic alignment framework that integrates reward optimization with intrinsic multimodal self-evaluation as reward and selective parameter adaptation for data and parameter efficient updates. Using RAFT, we achieve up to 39.52\\% relative improvement in accuracy on our benchmark. Together, AMUSE and RAFT provide a practical platform for examining agentic reasoning in multimodal models and improving their capabilities."}

Most of the standard RAG frameworks regard all retrieved information as equally reliable, overlooking the varying credibility and interconnected nature of large textual corpora. GraphRAG approaches offer potential improvement to RAG systems by integrating knowledge graphs, which structure information into nodes and edges, capture entity relationships, and enable multi-step logical traversal. However, GraphRAG is not always an ideal solution as it depends on high-quality graph representations of the corpus, which requires either pre-existing knowledge graphs that are expensive to build and update, or automated graph construction pipelines that are often unreliable. Moreover, systems following this paradigm typically use large language models to guide graph traversal and evidence retrieval, leading to challenges similar to those encountered with standard RAG. In this paper, we propose a novel RAG framework that employs the spreading activation algorithm to retrieve information from a corpus of documents interconnected by automatically constructed knowledge graphs, thereby enhancing the performance of large language models on complex tasks such as multi-hop question answering. Experiments show that our method achieves better or comparable performance to iterative RAG methodologies, while also being easily integrable as a plug-and-play module with a wide range of RAG-based approaches. Combining our method with chain-of-thought iterative retrieval yields up to a 39\\% absolute gain in answer correctness compared to naive RAG, achieving these results with small open-weight language models and highlighting its effectiveness in resource-constrained settings."}

While traditional low-rank approximations often rely on static rank assumptions--limiting their flexibility across diverse input contexts--our method dynamically selects ranks based on real-time sequence dynamics, layer-specific sensitivities, and hardware constraints. The core innovation lies in an RL agent that formulates rank selection as a sequential policy optimization problem, where the reward function strictly balances attention fidelity against computational latency. Crucially, we employ online matrix perturbation bounds to enable incremental rank updates, thereby avoiding the prohibitive cost of full decomposition during inference. Furthermore, the integration of a lightweight Transformer-based policy network and batched Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) operations ensures scalable deployment on modern GPU architectures. Experiments demonstrate that DR-RL maintains downstream accuracy statistically equivalent to full-rank attention while significantly reducing Floating Point Operations (FLOPs), particularly in long-sequence regimes (L > 4096).

While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across diverse tasks, their extensive computational requirements make them cost-prohibitive for routine enterprise use. This limitation motivates the exploration of Small Language Models (SLMs), which can deliver comparable performance in targeted applications while drastically reducing infrastructure overhead (Irugalbandara et al., 2023). In this work, we investigate the feasibility of replacing LLM-driven workflows with optimized SLMs. We trained a domain-adapted SLM to execute representative tasks traditionally handled by LLMs, such as document summarization, query answering, and structured data interpretation. As part of the experiment, we investigated the fine-tuning of facebook/opt-350m model (single epoch only) using the Hugging Face TRL (Transformer Reinforcement Learning), specifically the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) trainer. The OPT-350M model was released by Meta AI in 2022 as part of the OPT (Open Pretrained Transformer) family of models. Similar studies demonstrate that even models at the 350M parameter scale can meaningfully contribute to instruction-tuning pipelines (Mekala et al., 2024). Experimental results demonstrated that our fine-tuned SLM achieves exceptional performance with a 77.55\\% pass rate on ToolBench evaluation, significantly outperforming all baseline models including ChatGPT-CoT (26.00\\%), ToolLLaMA-DFS (30.18\\%), and ToolLLaMA-CoT (16.27\\%).

Conventional approaches often rely on location-independent parameterizations and independent training, underutilizing transfer learning and spatial heterogeneity in the inputs, and limiting their applicability in regions with substantial variability. We propose FTBSC-KGML (Fine-Tuning-Based Site Calibration-Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning), a pretraining- and fine-tuning-based, spatial-variability-aware, and knowledge-guided machine learning framework that augments KGML-ag with a pretraining-fine-tuning process and site-specific parameters. Using a pretraining-fine-tuning process with remote-sensing GPP, climate, and soil covariates collected across multiple midwestern sites, FTBSC-KGML estimates land emissions while leveraging transfer learning and spatial heterogeneity. A key component is a spatial-heterogeneity-aware transfer-learning scheme, which is a globally pretrained model that is fine-tuned at each state or site to learn place-aware representations, thereby improving local accuracy under limited data without sacrificing interpretability. Empirically, FTBSC-KGML achieves lower validation error and greater consistency in explanatory power than a purely global model, thereby better capturing spatial variability across states.

We address this gap by repositioning the LLM as an intelligent judge that evaluates, explains, and strategically coordinates an ensemble of foundation models. To overcome the LLM's inherent lack of domain-specific knowledge on time series, we introduce an R1-style finetuning process, guided by SHAP-based faithfulness scores, which teaches the model to interpret ensemble weights as meaningful causal statements about temporal dynamics. The trained agent then engages in iterative, multi-turn conversations to perform forward-looking assessments, provide causally-grounded explanations for its weighting decisions, and adaptively refine the optimization strategy.

Prevailing efforts to address this through enhancing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are trapped in a dilemma: template-based datasets are scalable but structurally rigid, while manual annotation is linguistically diverse but unscalable and, critically, computationally imprecise. We introduce SPRITE, a novel framework that overcomes this dilemma by leveraging simulators and large models to programmatically synthesize scalable, diverse, and high-quality spatial reasoning data. The core innovation of SPRITE is to reframe ground-truth generation as a code-generation task. We utilize LLMs to compile complex spatial questions into executable programs, which are then verified against high-precision scene meta-information extracted from simulators. This ensures our ground truth is both computationally precise and verifiable, while the generative power of LLMs provides vast linguistic diversity. Leveraging this pipeline, we have curated a dataset encompassing 3 simulators, 11k+ scenes, and 300k+ image/video instruction-tuning pairs. We demonstrate that a VLM trained on our data achieves significant performance gains on multiple spatial benchmarks and outperforms other open-source datasets of equivalent size. Furthermore, a scalability analysis confirms our hypothesis that overcoming the low-diversity nature of traditional template methods is essential for building robust, generalizable spatial intelligence.

Position-independent caching (PIC) enables chunk-level reuse at arbitrary positions, but requires selective recomputation and positional-encoding (PE) adjustments. However, because these operations vary across queries, KV for the same chunk diverges across requests. Moreover, without page alignment, chunk KV layouts diverge in memory, preventing page sharing. These issues result in only modest HBM savings even when many requests reuse the same content.\n  We present MEPIC, a memory-efficient PIC system that enables chunk KV reuse across positions, requests, and batches. MEPIC aligns chunk KV to paged storage, shifts recomputation from token- to block-level so only the first block is request-specific, removes positional encodings via Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) fusion in the attention kernel, and makes remaining blocks fully shareable. These techniques eliminate most duplicate chunk KV in HBM, reducing usage by up to 2x over state-of-the-art PIC at comparable latency and accuracy, and up to 5x for long prompts, without any model changes."}

Yet standard schemes (linear weight soups, task vectors, and Fisher-weighted averaging) can preserve loss while quietly destroying alignment. We argue that merging is not a numerical trick but a geometry-constrained operation around an already-aligned anchor: fusion must be steered to respect safety geometry, not validated post hoc.\n  We introduce AlignMerge, a geometry-aware merging framework that makes alignment an explicit invariant. In a local Fisher chart around an instruction-tuned base, we estimate an alignment subspace with projector P_A and optimize:\n  L_AlignMerge = L_geo + lambda_align * L_align + lambda_bud * L_bud,\n  where L_geo keeps the merge close to its experts in Fisher-Rao geometry, L_align penalizes motion along alignment-sensitive directions, and L_bud enforces a soft alignment budget. As the alignment functional we use the decoding-invariant Alignment Quality Index (AQI), a latent-space criterion that captures how cleanly aligned and misaligned behaviors separate in representation space.\n  Across five model families (LLaMA-3 8B, Mistral 7B, Qwen 2, Phi-3.5, Gemma 2), merging safety anchors with task experts, AlignMerge improves alignment metrics (AQI, toxicity, LLM-judge alignment) while matching or exceeding the best expert on instruction-following, reasoning, and helpfulness. It also exhibits smaller alignment-subspace drift and fewer budget violations than Fisher soups, TIES, SafeMerge, and MergeAlign. These results make alignment-preserving merging a first-class design goal and suggest a path to geometry-aware composition of future foundation models."}

In this paper, we present LaMer, a general Meta-RL framework that enables LLM agents to actively explore and learn from the environment feedback at test time. LaMer consists of two key components: (i) a cross-episode training framework to encourage exploration and long-term rewards optimization; and (ii) in-context policy adaptation via reflection, allowing the agent to adapt their policy from task feedback signal without gradient update. Experiments across diverse environments show that LaMer significantly improves performance over RL baselines, with 11%, 14%, and 19% performance gains on Sokoban, MineSweeper and Webshop, respectively. Moreover, LaMer also demonstrates better generalization to more challenging or previously unseen tasks compared to the RL-trained agents.

These scenarios are central to multimodal audio-video understanding, where models must jointly reason over audio and visual streams in applications such as conversational video assistants and meeting analytics. We introduce AMUSE, a benchmark designed around tasks that are inherently agentic, requiring models to decompose complex audio-visual interactions into planning, grounding, and reflection steps. It evaluates MLLMs across three modes zero-shot, guided, and agentic and six task families, including spatio-temporal speaker grounding and multimodal dialogue summarization. Across all modes, current models exhibit weak multi-speaker reasoning and inconsistent behavior under both non-agentic and agentic evaluation. Motivated by the inherently agentic nature of these tasks and recent advances in LLM agents, we propose RAFT, a data-efficient agentic alignment framework that integrates reward optimization with intrinsic multimodal self-evaluation as reward and selective parameter adaptation for data and parameter efficient updates. Using RAFT, we achieve up to 39.52\\% relative improvement in accuracy on our benchmark.

Recent studies suggest that RLVR can elicit strong mathematical reasoning in LLMs through two seemingly paradoxical mechanisms: spurious rewards, which suppress exploitation by rewarding outcomes unrelated to the ground truth, and entropy minimization, which suppresses exploration by pushing the model toward more confident and deterministic outputs, highlighting a puzzling dynamic: both discouraging exploitation and discouraging exploration improve reasoning performance, yet the underlying principles that reconcile these effects remain poorly understood. We focus on two fundamental questions: (i) how policy entropy relates to performance, and (ii) whether spurious rewards yield gains, potentially through the interplay of clipping bias and model contamination. Our results show that clipping bias under spurious rewards reduces policy entropy, leading to more confident and deterministic outputs, while entropy minimization alone is insufficient for improvement. We further propose a reward-misalignment model explaining why spurious rewards can enhance performance beyond contaminated settings. Our findings clarify the mechanisms behind spurious-reward benefits and provide principles for more effective RLVR training."}

We evaluated 13 experiments spanning fundamental optics (Hong-Ou-Mandel interference, Michelson/Mach-Zehnder interferometry, Bell states, delayed-choice quantum eraser), quantum information protocols (BB84 QKD, Franson interferometry, GHZ states, quantum teleportation, hyperentanglement), and advanced technologies (boson sampling, electromagnetically induced transparency, frequency conversion).

A critical finding distinguishes structural correctness from quantitative accuracy: high alignment confirms correct physics architecture, while numerical predictions require expert review.

Referee logic plus an efficient top-$k$ predicate updater keeps costs low by prioritizing checks and resolving conflicts hierarchically. Measured on ST-WebAgentBench (ICML CUA~'25) and AgentHarm (ICLR~'25), \\textsc{QuadSentinel} improves guardrail accuracy and rule recall while reducing false positives. Against single-agent baselines such as ShieldAgent (ICML~'25), it yields better overall safety control.

Owing to their unique combination of efficiency, scalability, and expressive capacity, SSMs have become compelling alternatives to transformer-based models, which suffer from the quadratic computational and memory costs of attention mechanisms. As SSMs are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, it is critical to assess their susceptibility to both software- and hardware-level threats to ensure secure and reliable operation. Among such threats, hardware-induced bit-flip attacks (BFAs) pose a particularly severe risk by corrupting model parameters through memory faults, thereby undermining model accuracy and functional integrity. To investigate this vulnerability, we introduce RAMBO, the first BFA framework specifically designed to target Mamba-based architectures. Through experiments on the Mamba-1.4b model with LAMBADA benchmark, a cloze-style word-prediction task, we demonstrate that flipping merely a single critical bit can catastrophically reduce accuracy from 74.64% to 0% and increase perplexity from 18.94 to 3.75 x 10^6.

While critic models offer a promising solution, their effectiveness is hindered by the lack of diverse, high-quality GUI feedback data and public critic benchmarks for step-level evaluation in computer use. To bridge these gaps, we introduce OS-Oracle that makes three core contributions: (1) a scalable data pipeline for synthesizing cross-platform GUI critic data; (2) a two-stage training paradigm combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and consistency-preserving group relative policy optimization (CP-GRPO); (3) OS-Critic Bench, a holistic benchmark for evaluating critic model performance across Mobile, Web, and Desktop platforms.

Leveraging the 1999 KDD CUP intrusion dataset as a benchmark, this research evaluates and optimizes several ML algorithms, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naïve Bayes variants (MNB, BNB), Random Forest (RF), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Decision Trees (DT), AdaBoost, XGBoost, Logistic Regression (LR), Ridge Classifier, Passive-Aggressive (PA) Classifier, Rocchio Classifier, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Perceptron (PPN).

MOBIMEM first introduces three specialized memory primitives to decouple agent evolution from model weights: (1) Profile Memory uses a lightweight distance-graph (DisGraph) structure to align with user preferences, resolving the accuracy-latency trade-off in user profile retrieval; (2) Experience Memory employs multi-level templates to instantiate execution logic for new tasks, ensuring capability generalization; and (3) Action Memory records fine-grained interaction sequences, reducing the reliance on expensive model inference. Building upon this memory architecture, MOBIMEM further integrates a suite of OS-inspired services to orchestrate execution: a scheduler that coordinates parallel sub-task execution and memory operations; an agent record-and-replay (AgentRR) mechanism that enables safe and efficient action reuse; and a context-aware exception handling that ensures graceful recovery from user interruptions and runtime errors.\n  Evaluation on AndroidWorld and top-50 apps shows that MOBIMEM achieves 83.1% profile alignment with 23.83 ms retrieval time (280x faster than GraphRAG baselines), improves task success rates by up to 50.3%, and reduces end-to-end latency by up to 9x on mobile devices."}

In traditional adversarial settings, code obfuscation has long been used as a general strategy to bypass auditing tools, preserving exploitability without tampering with the tools themselves. Numerous efforts have explored obfuscation methods and tools, yet their capabilities differ in terms of supported techniques, granularity, and programming languages, making it difficult to systematically assess their impact on LLM-based vulnerability detection. To address this gap, we provide a structured systematization of obfuscation techniques and evaluate them under a unified framework. Specifically, we categorize existing obfuscation methods into three major classes (layout, data flow, and control flow) covering 11 subcategories and 19 concrete techniques. We implement these techniques across four programming languages (Solidity, C, C++, and Python) using a consistent LLM-driven approach, and evaluate their effects on 15 LLMs spanning four model families (DeepSeek, OpenAI, Qwen, and LLaMA), as well as on two coding agents (GitHub Copilot and Codex). Our findings reveal both positive and negative impacts of code obfuscation on LLM-based vulnerability detection, highlighting conditions under which obfuscation leads to performance improvements or degradations.

We are witnessing the rise of a dangerous literacy gap, where a focus on the functional, operational skills of using AI tools is eclipsing the development of critical and ethical reasoning about them. This position paper argues for a systemic shift toward comprehensive AI literacy that centers human agency - the empowered capacity for intentional, critical, and responsible choice. This principle applies to all stakeholders in the educational ecosystem: it is the student's agency to question, create with, or consciously decide not to use AI based on the task; it is the teacher's agency to design learning experiences that align with instructional values, rather than ceding pedagogical control to a tool. True literacy involves teaching about agency itself, framing technology not as an inevitability to be adopted, but as a choice to be made. This requires a deep commitment to critical thinking and a robust understanding of epistemology. Through the AI Literacy, Fluency, and Competency frameworks described in this paper, educators and students will become agents in their own human-centric approaches to AI, providing necessary pathways to clearly articulate the intentions informing decisions and attitudes toward AI and the impact of these decisions on academic work, career, and society."}

We systematically compare single-agent and multi-agent pipelines on four visual math benchmarks: Geometry3K, MathVerse, OlympiadBench, and We-Math. For open-source models, multi-agent consistently improves performance. For example, Qwen-2.5-VL (7B) gains +6.8 points and Qwen-2.5-VL (32B) gains +3.3 on Geometry3K, and both Qwen-2.5-VL variants see further gains on OlympiadBench and We-Math. In contrast, the closed-source Gemini-2.0-Flash generally performs better in single-agent mode on classic benchmarks, while multi-agent yields only modest improvements on the newer We-Math dataset.

Here we argue that this patchwork AGI hypothesis needs to be given serious consideration, and should inform the development of corresponding safeguards and mitigations. The rapid deployment of advanced AI agents with tool-use capabilities and the ability to communicate and coordinate makes this an urgent safety consideration. We therefore propose a framework for distributional AGI safety that moves beyond evaluating and aligning individual agents. This framework centers on the design and implementation of virtual agentic sandbox economies (impermeable or semi-permeable), where agent-to-agent transactions are governed by robust market mechanisms, coupled with appropriate auditability, reputation management, and oversight to mitigate collective risks."}

To address this limitation, we propose GLOW, a unified framework for AW performance prediction that combines the graph-structure modeling capabilities of GNNs with the reasoning power of LLMs. Specifically, we introduce a graph-oriented LLM, instruction-tuned on graph tasks, to extract topologically aware semantic features, which are fused with GNN-encoded structural representations. A contrastive alignment strategy further refines the latent space to distinguish high-quality AWs.

Trusted for their ability to act without direct oversight, such agents are increasingly considered in high-stakes domains including financial management, dispute resolution, and governance. Yet in practice, agents execute on infrastructure controlled by a host, who can tamper with models, inputs, or outputs, undermining any meaningful notion of autonomy.\n  We address this gap by introducing VET (Verifiable Execution Traces), a formal framework that achieves host-independent authentication of agent outputs and takes a step toward host-independent autonomy. Central to VET is the Agent Identity Document (AID), which specifies an agent's configuration together with the proof systems required for verification. VET is compositional: it supports multiple proof mechanisms, including trusted hardware, succinct cryptographic proofs, and notarized TLS transcripts (Web Proofs).\n  We implement VET for an API-based LLM agent and evaluate our instantiation on realistic workloads. We find that for today's black-box, secret-bearing API calls, Web Proofs appear to be the most practical choice, with overhead typically under 3$\\times$ compared to direct API calls, while for public API calls, a lower-overhead TEE Proxy is often sufficient. As a case study, we deploy a verifiable trading agent that produces proofs for each decision and composes Web Proofs with a TEE Proxy. Our results demonstrate that practical, host-agnostic authentication is already possible with current technology, laying the foundation for future systems that achieve full host-independent autonomy."}

We propose FTBSC-KGML (Fine-Tuning-Based Site Calibration-Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning), a pretraining- and fine-tuning-based, spatial-variability-aware, and knowledge-guided machine learning framework that augments KGML-ag with a pretraining-fine-tuning process and site-specific parameters.

A key component is a spatial-heterogeneity-aware transfer-learning scheme, which is a globally pretrained model that is fine-tuned at each state or site to learn place-aware representations, thereby improving local accuracy under limited data without sacrificing interpretability. Empirically, FTBSC-KGML achieves lower validation error and greater consistency in explanatory power than a purely global model, thereby better capturing spatial variability across states.

To address this issue, we propose Ev-Trust, a strategy-equilibrium trust mechanism grounded in evolutionary game theory. This mechanism integrates direct trust, indirect trust, and expected revenue into a dynamic feedback structure that guides agents' behavioral evolution toward equilibria. Within a decentralized \"Request-Response-Payment-Evaluation\" service framework, Ev-Trust enables agents to adaptively adjust strategies, naturally excluding malicious participants while reinforcing high-quality collaboration. Furthermore, our theoretical derivation based on replicator dynamics equations proves the existence and stability of local evolutionary equilibria.

Our findings show that LLMs are already widely deployed within scam organizations, with 87% of scam labor consisting of systematized conversational tasks readily susceptible to automation.

However, this architecture also introduces a new and severe privacy risk, which we term Tools Orchestration Privacy Risk (TOP-R), where an agent, to achieve a benign user goal, autonomously aggregates information fragments across multiple tools and leverages its reasoning capabilities to synthesize unexpected sensitive information. We provide the first systematic study of this risk. First, we establish a formal framework, attributing the risk's root cause to the agent's misaligned objective function: an overoptimization for helpfulness while neglecting privacy awareness. Second, we construct TOP-Bench, comprising paired leakage and benign scenarios, to comprehensively evaluate this risk. To quantify the trade-off between safety and robustness, we introduce the H-Score as a holistic metric. The evaluation results reveal that TOP-R is a severe risk: the average Risk Leakage Rate (RLR) of eight representative models reaches 90.24%, while the average H-Score is merely 0.167, with no model exceeding 0.3. Finally, we propose the Privacy Enhancement Principle (PEP) method, which effectively mitigates TOP-R, reducing the Risk Leakage Rate to 46.58% and significantly improving the H-Score to 0.624.

However, the lack of effective evaluation methodologies has made it difficult to estimate the risk of bias, making deployment of such systems unsafe in high stakes domains such as consumer finance, where biased decisions can translate directly into regulatory breaches and financial loss. To address this challenge, we need to develop fairness evaluation methodologies for multi-agent predictive systems and measure the fairness characteristics of these systems in the financial tabular domain. Examining fairness metrics using large-scale simulations across diverse multi-agent configurations, with varying communication and collaboration mechanisms, we reveal patterns of emergent bias in financial decision-making that cannot be traced to individual agent components, indicating that multi-agent systems may exhibit genuinely collective behaviors. Our findings highlight that fairness risks in financial multi-agent systems represent a significant component of model risk, with tangible impacts on tasks such as credit scoring and income estimation. We advocate that multi-agent decision systems must be evaluated as holistic entities rather than through reductionist analyses of their constituent components."}

However, the RL-trained agents often struggle in tasks that require active exploration and fail to efficiently adapt from trial-and-error experiences. In this paper, we present LaMer, a general Meta-RL framework that enables LLM agents to actively explore and learn from the environment feedback at test time. LaMer consists of two key components: (i) a cross-episode training framework to encourage exploration and long-term rewards optimization; and (ii) in-context policy adaptation via reflection, allowing the agent to adapt their policy from task feedback signal without gradient update. Experiments across diverse environments show that LaMer significantly improves performance over RL baselines, with 11%, 14%, and 19% performance gains on Sokoban, MineSweeper and Webshop, respectively. Moreover, LaMer also demonstrates better generalization to more challenging or previously unseen tasks compared to the RL-trained agents. Overall, our results demonstrate that Meta-RL provides a principled approach to induce exploration in language agents, enabling more robust adaptation to novel environments through learned exploration strategies."}

Exploitation: Rethinking RLVR through Clipping, Entropy, and Spurious Reward", "comment": "35 pages", "summary": "This paper examines the exploration-exploitation trade-off in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), a framework for improving the reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent studies suggest that RLVR can elicit strong mathematical reasoning in LLMs through two seemingly paradoxical mechanisms: spurious rewards, which suppress exploitation by rewarding outcomes unrelated to the ground truth, and entropy minimization, which suppresses exploration by pushing the model toward more confident and deterministic outputs, highlighting a puzzling dynamic: both discouraging exploitation and discouraging exploration improve reasoning performance, yet the underlying principles that reconcile these effects remain poorly understood. We focus on two fundamental questions: (i) how policy entropy relates to performance, and (ii) whether spurious rewards yield gains, potentially through the interplay of clipping bias and model contamination. Our results show that clipping bias under spurious rewards reduces policy entropy, leading to more confident and deterministic outputs, while entropy minimization alone is insufficient for improvement. We further propose a reward-misalignment model explaining why spurious rewards can enhance performance beyond contaminated settings. Our findings clarify the mechanisms behind spurious-reward benefits and provide principles for more effective RLVR training."}
