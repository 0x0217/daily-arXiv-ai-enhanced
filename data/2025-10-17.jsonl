However, these systems often suffer substantial overhead from\nrepeated reprocessing of overlapping contexts across agents. In typical\npipelines, once an agent receives a message from its predecessor, the full\ncontext-including prior turns-must be reprocessed from scratch, leading to\ninefficient processing. While key-value (KV) caching is an effective solution\nfor avoiding redundant computation in single-agent settings where prefixes\nremain unchanged, it cannot be directly reused in multi-agent scenarios due to\ndiverging prefixes introduced by agent-specific context extensions. We identify\nthat the core challenge lies in the offset variance of KV-caches across agents.\nTo address this, we propose KVCOMM, a training-free framework that enables\nefficient prefilling in multi-agent inference by reusing KV-caches and aligning\ncache offsets of overlapping contexts under diverse prefix contexts. KVCOMM\nestimates and adjusts KV-caches for shared content by referencing a pool of\ncached examples-termed anchors-that store observed cache deviations under\nvarying prefixes. The anchor pool is maintained and updated online, allowing\ndynamic adaptation to distinct user requests and context structures. KVCOMM\nachieves over 70% reuse rate across diverse multi-agent workloads, including\nretrieval-augmented generation, math reasoning, and collaborative coding tasks,\nall without quality degradation. Particularly, when each fully-connected agent\nreceives 1K input tokens with 512 prefix tokens and 512 output tokens under a\nfive-agent setting, KVCOMM achieves up to 7.8x speedup compared to the standard\nprefill pipeline, reducing TTFT from ~430 ms to ~55 ms."}

Recently, MARL\nmodels, such as the Multi-Agent Transformer (MAT) and ACtion dEpendent deep\nQ-learning (ACE), have significantly improved performance by leveraging\nsequential decision-making processes. Although these models can enhance\nperformance, they do not explicitly consider the importance of the order in\nwhich agents make decisions.

The proposed model explicitly incorporates the sequence\nof action decisions into the learning process, allowing the model to learn and\npredict the optimal order of agent actions. The AOAD-MAT model leverages a\nTransformer-based actor-critic architecture that dynamically adjusts the\nsequence of agent actions. To achieve this, we introduce a novel MARL\narchitecture that cooperates with a subtask focused on predicting the next\nagent to act, integrated into a Proximal Policy Optimization based loss\nfunction to synergistically maximize the advantage of the sequential\ndecision-making.

We model this interaction as a\nStackelberg game where a principal, acting as the classifier, first announces\nits decision policy, and then strategic agents, acting as followers, manipulate\ntheir features to receive a desired outcome.

This paper presents a\nphysics-augmented multi-task Gaussian Process (P-M-GP) framework tailored for\nspatiotemporal dynamic systems. Specifically, we develop a geometry-aware,\nmulti-task Gaussian Process (M-GP) model to effectively capture intrinsic\nspatiotemporal structure and inter-task dependencies. To further enhance the\nmodel fidelity and robustness, we incorporate governing physical laws through a\nphysics-based regularization scheme, thereby constraining predictions to be\nconsistent with governing dynamical principles. We validate the proposed P-M-GP\nframework on a 3D cardiac electrodynamics modeling task. Numerical experiments\ndemonstrate that our method significantly improves prediction accuracy over\nexisting methods by effectively incorporating domain-specific physical\nconstraints and geometric prior."}

However, time-varying optimization has emerged as an important\nsubject for decision-making in dynamic environments. In this work, we study the\nproblem of learning from streaming data through a time-varying optimization\nlens. Unlike prior works that focus on generic formulations, we introduce a\nstructured, \\emph{weight-based} formulation that explicitly captures the\nstreaming-data origin of the time-varying objective, where at each time step,\nan agent aims to minimize a weighted average loss over all the past data\nsamples. We focus on two specific weighting strategies: (1) uniform weights,\nwhich treat all samples equally, and (2) discounted weights, which\ngeometrically decay the influence of older data. For both schemes, we derive\ntight bounds on the ``tracking error'' (TE), defined as the deviation between\nthe model parameter and the time-varying optimum at a given time step, under\ngradient descent (GD) updates. We show that under uniform weighting, the TE\nvanishes asymptotically with a $\\mathcal{O}(1/t)$ decay rate, whereas\ndiscounted weighting incurs a nonzero error floor controlled by the discount\nfactor and the number of gradient updates performed at each time step.

In this work, we introduce the first paradigm of\nrevocable backdoor attacks, where the backdoor can be proactively and\nthoroughly removed after the attack objective is achieved. We formulate the\ntrigger optimization in revocable backdoor attacks as a bilevel optimization\nproblem: by simulating both backdoor injection and unlearning processes, the\ntrigger generator is optimized to achieve a high attack success rate (ASR)\nwhile ensuring that the backdoor can be easily erased through unlearning.
