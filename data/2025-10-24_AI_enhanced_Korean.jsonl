To that end, tremendous efforts\nhave been made to pretraining large models on extensive unlabeled fMRI data\nusing scalable self-supervised learning. Since self-supervision is not\nnecessarily aligned with the brain-to-outcome relationship, most foundation\nmodels are suboptimal to the downstream task, such as predicting disease\noutcomes. By capitalizing on rich environmental variables and demographic data\nalong with an unprecedented amount of functional neuroimages, we form the brain\nmodeling as a multitask learning and present a scalable model architecture for\n(i) multitask pretraining by tokenizing multiple brain-environment interactions\n(BEI) and (ii) semi-supervised finetuning by assigning pseudo-labels of\npretrained BEI. We have evaluated our foundation model on a variety of\napplications, including sex prediction, human behavior recognition, and disease\nearly diagnosis of Autism, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's

Presented at the 6th Deep Learning Indaba (DLI\n  2024), Dakar, Senegal; non-archival presentation. Poster:\n  https://storage.googleapis.com/indaba-public/Oluwaseun_Ajayi%20.pdf", "summary": "The recent widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) and machine\nlearning in general has sparked research interest in exploring the\npossibilities of deploying these models on smaller devices such as laptops and\nmobile phones. This creates a need for frameworks and approaches that are\ncapable of taking advantage of on-device hardware. The MLX framework was\ncreated to address this need. It is a framework optimized for machine learning\n(ML) computations on Apple silicon devices, facilitating easier research,\nexperimentation, and prototyping.\n  This paper presents a performance evaluation of MLX, focusing on inference\nlatency of transformer models. We compare the performance of different\ntransformer architecture implementations in MLX with their Pytorch\ncounterparts. For this research we create a framework called MLX-transformers\nwhich includes different transformer implementations in MLX and downloads the\nmodel checkpoints in pytorch and converts it to the MLX format. By leveraging\nthe advanced architecture and capabilities of Apple Silicon, MLX-Transformers\nenables seamless execution of transformer models directly sourced from Hugging\nFace, eliminating the need for checkpoint conversion often required when\nporting models between frameworks.\n  Our study benchmarks different transformer models on two Apple Silicon\nmacbook devices against an NVIDIA CUDA GPU. Specifically, we compare the\ninference latency performance of models with the same parameter sizes and\ncheckpoints. We evaluate the performance of BERT, RoBERTa, and XLM-RoBERTa\nmodels, with the intention of extending future work to include models of\ndifferent modalities, thus providing a more comprehensive assessment of MLX's\ncapabilities.

Agentic AI has emerged as a key enabler by supporting autonomous\ndecision-making and adaptive coordination, allowing urban systems to respond in\nreal time to dynamic conditions. Its benefits are evident in areas such as\ntransportation, where the integration of traffic data, weather forecasts, and\nsafety sensors enables dynamic rerouting and a faster response to hazards.\nHowever, its deployment across heterogeneous smart city ecosystems raises\ncritical governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) challenges, including\naccountability, data privacy, and regulatory alignment within decentralized\ninfrastructures. Evaluation of SORA-ATMAS with three domain agents (Weather,\nTraffic, and Safety) demonstrated that its governance policies, including a\nfallback mechanism for high-risk scenarios, effectively steer multiple LLMs\n(GPT, Grok, DeepSeek) towards domain-optimized, policy-aligned outputs,\nproducing an average MAE reduction of 35% across agents. Results showed stable\nweather monitoring, effective handling of high-risk traffic plateaus 0.85, and\nadaptive trust regulation in Safety/Fire scenarios 0.65. Runtime profiling of a\n3-agent deployment confirmed scalability, with throughput between 13.8-17.2\nrequests per second, execution times below 72~ms, and governance delays under\n100 ms, analytical projections suggest maintained performance at larger scales.\nCross-domain rules ensured safe interoperability, with traffic rerouting\npermitted only under validated weather conditions. These findings validate\nSORA-ATMAS as a regulation-aligned, context-aware, and verifiable governance\nframework that consolidates distributed agent outputs into accountable,\nreal-time decisions, offering a resilient foundation for smart-city management.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uc2dc\ud2f0\uc758 \ube60\ub978 \ubc1c\uc804\uc774 \uc778\ud504\ub77c\uc640 \uc2dc\ubbfc\uc758 \ubcf5\uc9c0\ub97c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc5f0\uacb0\ub41c \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ucf30\ub2e4.

Although obtaining tight bounds remains challenging, such\nmeasures are often assumed to reproduce qualitative generalization trends. In\nthis position paper, we argue that many post-mortem generalization measures --\nthose computed on trained networks -- are \\textbf{fragile}: small training\nmodifications that barely affect the underlying DNN can substantially change a\nmeasure's value, trend, or scaling behavior. For example, minor hyperparameter\nchanges, such as learning rate adjustments or switching between SGD variants\ncan reverse the slope of a learning curve in widely used generalization\nmeasures like the path norm. We also identify subtler forms of fragility. For\ninstance, the PAC-Bayes origin measure is regarded as one of the most reliable,\nand is indeed less sensitive to hyperparameter tweaks than many other measures.\nHowever, it completely fails to capture differences in data complexity across\nlearning curves. This data fragility contrasts with the function-based\nmarginal-likelihood PAC-Bayes bound, which does capture differences in\ndata-complexity, including scaling behavior, in learning curves, but which is\nnot a post-mortem measure. Beyond demonstrating that many bounds -- such as\npath, spectral and Frobenius norms, flatness proxies, and deterministic\nPAC-Bayes surrogates -- are fragile, this position paper also argues that\ndevelopers of new measures should explicitly audit them for fragility.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub525 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(DNN)\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uce21\uc815\uc774 \uc5bc\ub9c8\ub098 \ucde8\uc57d\ud55c\uc9c0\ub97c \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud558\uba70, \uc791\uc740 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc218\uc815\uc774 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ucc99\ub3c4\uc758 \uac12\uc774\ub098 \ucd94\uc138\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "DNN\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uce21\uc815\uc740 \ud754\ud788 \uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc744 \uc7ac\ud604\ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \uac00\uc815\ub418\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc2e4\uc81c\ub85c\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uacc4\uc0b0\ub418\ub294 \ub9ce\uc740 \ucc99\ub3c4\uac00 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "\uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ucc99\ub3c4\uc758 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \ubc1d\ud790 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uba87 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc608\uc2dc\uc640 \uad00\ucc30\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5.", "result": "\ud558\uc774\ud37c\ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130\uc758 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc774 DNN\uc5d0 \uac70\uc758 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc74c\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \uacbd\ub7c9\ud654 \uacbd\ud5a5 \uce21\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ud070 \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uce21\uc815\uce58\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\ub294 \uc0ac\ub78c\ub4e4\uc740 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc778\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uce21\uc815\uc774 \ub525 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(DNN)\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uc5c4\ubc00\ud55c \uacbd\uacc4 \uac12\uc744 \uc5bb\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uce21\uc815\uce58\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ucd94\uc138\ub97c \uc7ac\ud604\ud560 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \uac00\uc815\ub418\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uacc4\uc0b0\ub41c \ub9ce\uc740 \uc0ac\ud6c4 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uce21\uc815\uc774 '\ucde8\uc57d'\ud558\ub2e4\uace0 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

In this technical\nreport, we present ColorAgent, an OS agent designed to engage in long-horizon,\nrobust interactions with the environment while also enabling personalized and\nproactive user interaction. To enable long-horizon interactions with the\nenvironment, we enhance the model's capabilities through step-wise\nreinforcement learning and self-evolving training, while also developing a\ntailored multi-agent framework that ensures generality, consistency, and\nrobustness. In terms of user interaction, we explore personalized user intent\nrecognition and proactive engagement, positioning the OS agent not merely as an\nautomation tool but as a warm, collaborative partner. We evaluate ColorAgent on\nthe AndroidWorld and AndroidLab benchmarks, achieving success rates of 77.2%\nand 50.7%, respectively, establishing a new state of the art. Nonetheless, we\nnote that current benchmarks are insufficient for a comprehensive evaluation of\nOS agents and propose further exploring directions in future work, particularly\nin the areas of evaluation paradigms, agent collaboration, and security.

By injecting malicious instructions into the data\nthat LLMs access, an attacker can arbitrarily override the original user task\nand redirect the agent toward unintended, potentially harmful actions. Existing\ndefenses either require access to model weights (fine-tuning), incur\nsubstantial utility loss (detection-based), or demand non-trivial system\nredesign (system-level). Motivated by this, we propose DataFilter, a test-time\nmodel-agnostic defense that removes malicious instructions from the data before\nit reaches the backend LLM. DataFilter is trained with supervised fine-tuning\non simulated injections and leverages both the user's instruction and the data\nto selectively strip adversarial content while preserving benign information.\nAcross multiple benchmarks, DataFilter consistently reduces the prompt\ninjection attack success rates to near zero while maintaining the LLMs'\nutility. DataFilter delivers strong security, high utility, and plug-and-play\ndeployment, making it a strong practical defense to secure black-box commercial\nLLMs against prompt injection.

This work establishes a\nvision-language model (VLM) that encodes videos with text input in order to\nclassify various behaviors of a mouse existing in and engaging with their\nenvironment. Importantly, this model produces a behavioral vector over time for\neach subject and for each session the subject undergoes. The output is a\nvaluable dataset that few programs are able to produce with as high accuracy\nand with minimal user input. Specifically, we use the open-source Qwen2.5-VL\nmodel and enhance its performance through prompts, in-context learning (ICL)\nwith labeled examples, and frame-level preprocessing. We found that each of\nthese methods contributes to improved classification, and that combining them\nresults in strong F1 scores across all behaviors, including rare classes like\nfreezing and fleeing, without any model fine-tuning. Overall, this model will\nsupport interdisciplinary researchers studying mouse behavior by enabling them\nto integrate diverse behavioral features, measured across multiple time points\nand environments, into a comprehensive dataset that can address complex\nresearch questions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ube44\ub514\uc624\uc640 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc785\ub825\uc744 \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ud558\uc5ec \ud658\uacbd\uacfc \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc950\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubd84\ub958\ud558\ub294 \ube44\uc804-\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(VLM)\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud1b5\ud569\uc740 \ub9ce\uc740 \uacfc\ud559 \ud0d0\uad6c \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub2e8\uacc4\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "Qwen2.5-VL \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uace0, \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8, \ub9e5\ub77d \ud559\uc2b5(ICL), \ud504\ub808\uc784 \uc218\uc900 \uc804\ucc98\ub9ac\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf30\ub2e4.", "result": "\uac01 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ubd84\ub958 \uac1c\uc120\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \uc870\ud569\ud558\uba74 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud29c\ub2dd \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c F1 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \uc5bb\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc2dc\uc810\uacfc \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uce21\uc815\ub41c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc744 \uc904 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ud1b5\ud569\uc740 \ub9ce\uc740 \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \ud0d0\uad6c \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub2e8\uacc4\uac00 \ub420 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc791\uc5c5\uc740 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\uace0 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc791\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc950\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubd84\ub958\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ube44\ub514\uc624\uc640 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc785\ub825\uc744 \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ud558\ub294 \ube44\uc804-\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(VLM)\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uac83\uc740 \uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uac01 \uc8fc\uccb4\uc640 \uc8fc\uccb4\uac00 \uacaa\ub294 \uac01 \uc138\uc158\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \ud589\ub3d9 \ubca1\ud130\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4. \ucd9c\ub825\uc740 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ub192\uc740 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub85c \ucd5c\uc18c\ud55c\uc758 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc785\ub825\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uadc0\uc911\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc774\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc624\ud508 \uc18c\uc2a4 Qwen2.5-VL \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uace0 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8, \ub808\uc774\ube14\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uc608\uc2dc\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \ub0b4\ubd80 \ud559\uc2b5(ICL), \ud504\ub808\uc784 \uc218\uc900 \uc804\ucc98\ub9ac\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf30\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac01 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ubd84\ub958 \uac1c\uc120\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub4e4\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uba74 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c F1 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\uace0, \uc5bc\uc5b4\ubd99\uae30 \ubc0f \ub3c4\ub9dd\uac00\uae30\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ud76c\uadc0 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4 \uc5ed\uc2dc \ubaa8\ub378 \ud29c\ub2dd \uc5c6\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc5bb\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc804\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc950 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \ud559\uc81c\uac04 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc790\ub4e4\uc774 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc2dc\uc810\uacfc \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uce21\uc815\ub41c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c \uc9c8\ubb38\uc5d0 \ub300\uc751\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc744 \uc904 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4."}}

This\npaper presents an architecture for modeling realistic human mobility behavior\nin complex multimodal transport systems, demonstrated through a case study in\nToulouse, France. We apply Large Language Models (LLMs) within an agent-based\nsimulation to capture decision-making in a real urban setting. The framework\nintegrates the GAMA simulation platform with an LLM-based generative agent,\nalong with General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data for public transport,\nand OpenTripPlanner for multimodal routing. GAMA platform models the\ninteractive transport environment, providing visualization and dynamic agent\ninteractions while eliminating the need to construct the simulation environment\nfrom scratch. This design enables a stronger focus on developing generative\nagents and evaluating their performance in transport decision-making processes.\nOver a simulated month, results show that agents not only make context-aware\ntransport decisions but also form habits over time. We conclude that combining\nLLMs with agent-based simulation offers a promising direction for advancing\nintelligent transportation systems and personalised multimodal mobility\nsolutions.

However, this often leads\nto overthinking, resulting in unnecessary computational overhead. To address\nthis issue, Mode Selection aims to automatically decide between Long-CoT\n(Chain-of-Thought) or Short-CoT by utilizing either a Thinking or NoThinking\nmode. Simultaneously, Early Exit determines the optimal stopping point during\nthe iterative reasoning process. Both methods seek to reduce the computational\nburden. In this paper, we first identify Mode Selection as a more challenging\nvariant of the Early Exit problem, as they share similar objectives but differ\nin decision timing. While Early Exit focuses on determining the best stopping\npoint for concise reasoning at inference time, Mode Selection must make this\ndecision at the beginning of the reasoning process, relying on pre-defined fake\nthoughts without engaging in an explicit reasoning process, referred to as\nzero-step thinking. Through empirical studies on nine baselines, we observe\nthat prompt-based approaches often fail due to their limited classification\ncapabilities when provided with minimal hand-crafted information.

In this work, we focus on\nmean-field parameterization and advance the theoretical understanding of NGVI\nin three key directions. First, we derive sufficient conditions under which the\nvariational loss satisfies relative smoothness with respect to a suitable\nmirror map. Second, leveraging this structure, we propose a modified NGVI\nalgorithm incorporating non-Euclidean projections and prove its global\nnon-asymptotic convergence to a stationary point. Finally, under additional\nstructural assumptions about the likelihood, we uncover hidden convexity\nproperties of the variational loss and establish fast global convergence of\nNGVI to a global optimum.

This problem\nis fundamental to swarm robotics applications like self-reconfiguration and\nmarching, where standard MAPF is insufficient as it does not guarantee the\nrequired connectivity between agents. While unlabeled MAPF is tractable in\noptimization, CUMAPF is NP-hard even on highly restricted graph classes. To\ntackle this challenge, we propose PULL, a complete and polynomial-time\nalgorithm with a simple design. It is based on a rule-based one-step function\nthat computes a subsequent configuration that preserves connectivity and\nadvances towards the target configuration.

However, trustworthiness issues in MAS\nremain a critical concern. Unlike challenges in single-agent systems, MAS\ninvolve more complex communication processes, making them susceptible to\ncorruption attacks. To mitigate this issue, several defense mechanisms have\nbeen developed based on the graph representation of MAS, where agents represent\nnodes and communications form edges. Nevertheless, these methods predominantly\nfocus on static graph defense, attempting to either detect attacks in a fixed\ngraph structure or optimize a static topology with certain defensive\ncapabilities. To address this limitation, we propose a dynamic defense paradigm\nfor MAS graph structures, which continuously monitors communication within the\nMAS graph, then dynamically adjusts the graph topology, accurately disrupts\nmalicious communications, and effectively defends against evolving and diverse\ndynamic attacks. Experimental results in increasingly complex and dynamic MAS\nenvironments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing MAS\ndefense mechanisms, contributing an effective guardrail for their trustworthy\napplications.

We present WebGraphEval, a framework that\nabstracts trajectories from multiple agents into a unified, weighted action\ngraph. This representation is directly compatible with benchmarks such as\nWebArena, leveraging leaderboard runs and newly collected trajectories without\nmodifying environments.

We establish finite-time\nconvergence analysis for the algorithm under Markov-sampling. Specifically, to\nattain the $\\varepsilon$-accurate stationary point, the sample complexity is of\norder $\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon^{-3})$ and the communication complexity is of\norder $\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon^{-1}\\tau^{-1})$, where tau denotes the number of\nlocal training steps.

The existing SILVER\nframework (Li, Siddique, and Cao 2025) explains RL policy via Shapley-based\nregression but remains restricted to low-dimensional, binary-action domains. We\npropose SILVER with RL-guided labeling, an enhanced variant that extends SILVER\nto multi-action and high-dimensional environments by incorporating the RL\npolicy's own action outputs into the boundary points identification. Our method\nfirst extracts compact feature representations from image observations,\nperforms SHAP-based feature attribution, and then employs RL-guided labeling to\ngenerate behaviorally consistent boundary datasets. Surrogate models, such as\ndecision trees and regression-based functions, are subsequently trained to\ninterpret RL policy's decision structure. We evaluate the proposed framework on\ntwo Atari environments using three deep RL algorithms and conduct human-subject\nstudy to assess the clarity and trustworthiness of the derived interpretable\npolicy. Results show that our approach maintains competitive task performance\nwhile substantially improving transparency and human understanding of agent\nbehavior.

However, real-world environments are typically\nnon-stationary, requiring agents to continuously adapt to new tasks and\nchanging conditions. Although Continual Reinforcement Learning facilitates\nlearning across multiple tasks, existing methods often suffer from catastrophic\nforgetting and inefficient knowledge utilization. To address these challenges,\nwe propose Continual Knowledge Adaptation for Reinforcement Learning (CKA-RL),\nwhich enables the accumulation and effective utilization of historical\nknowledge. Specifically, we introduce a Continual Knowledge Adaptation\nstrategy, which involves maintaining a task-specific knowledge vector pool and\ndynamically using historical knowledge to adapt the agent to new tasks. This\nprocess mitigates catastrophic forgetting and enables efficient knowledge\ntransfer across tasks by preserving and adapting critical model parameters.\nAdditionally, we propose an Adaptive Knowledge Merging mechanism that combines\nsimilar knowledge vectors to address scalability challenges, reducing memory\nrequirements while ensuring the retention of essential knowledge. Experiments\non three benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed CKA-RL outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods, achieving an improvement of 4.20% in overall\nperformance and 8.02% in forward transfer.

The lacking of meaningful functional rewards hinders\nthe preference optimization based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) for producing\nfunctionally correct Verilog code. In this paper, we propose Signal-Aware\nLearning for Verilog code generation (QiMeng-SALV) by leveraging code segments\nof functionally correct output signal to optimize RL training. Considering\nVerilog code specifies the structural interconnection of hardware gates and\nwires so that different output signals are independent, the key insight of\nQiMeng-SALV is to extract verified signal-aware implementations in partially\nincorrect modules, so as to enhance the extraction of meaningful functional\nrewards. Roughly, we verify the functional correctness of signals in generated\nmodule by comparing with that of reference module in the training data. Then\nabstract syntax tree (AST) is employed to identify signal-aware code segments\nwhich can provide meaningful functional rewards from erroneous modules.\nFinally, we introduce signal-aware DPO which is optimized on the correct\nsignal-level code segments, thereby preventing noise and interference from\nincorrect signals. The proposed QiMeng-SALV underscores the paradigm shift from\nconventional module-level to fine-grained signal-level optimization in Verilog\ncode generation, addressing the issue of insufficient functional rewards.\nExperiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance\non VerilogEval and RTLLM, with a 7B parameter model matching the performance of\nthe DeepSeek v3 671B model and significantly outperforming the leading\nopen-source model CodeV trained on the same dataset.

These rules often feature vague boundaries\nand implicit logic relationships, making precise application challenging for\nagents. However, this critical capability is largely overlooked by current\nagent benchmarks.\n  To fill this gap, we introduce HSCodeComp, the first realistic, expert-level\ne-commerce benchmark designed to evaluate deep search agents in hierarchical\nrule application. In this task, the deep reasoning process of agents is guided\nby these rules to predict 10-digit Harmonized System Code (HSCode) of products\nwith noisy but realistic descriptions. These codes, established by the World\nCustoms Organization, are vital for global supply chain efficiency. Built from\nreal-world data collected from large-scale e-commerce platforms, our proposed\nHSCodeComp comprises 632 product entries spanning diverse product categories,\nwith these HSCodes annotated by several human experts.\n  Extensive experimental results on several state-of-the-art LLMs, open-source,\nand closed-source agents reveal a huge performance gap: best agent achieves\nonly 46.8% 10-digit accuracy, far below human experts at 95.0%. Besides,\ndetailed analysis demonstrates the challenges of hierarchical rule application,\nand test-time scaling fails to improve performance further.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740

To this end, we present NeSyPr, a novel embodied reasoning\nframework that compiles knowledge via neurosymbolic proceduralization, thereby\nequipping LM-based agents with structured, adaptive, and timely reasoning\ncapabilities. In NeSyPr, task-specific plans are first explicitly generated by\na symbolic tool leveraging its declarative knowledge. These plans are then\ntransformed into composable procedural representations that encode the plans'\nimplicit production rules, enabling the resulting composed procedures to be\nseamlessly integrated into the LM's inference process. This neurosymbolic\nproceduralization abstracts and generalizes multi-step symbolic structured\npath-finding and reasoning into single-step LM inference, akin to human\nknowledge compilation. It supports efficient test-time inference without\nrelying on external symbolic guidance, making it well suited for deployment in\nlatency-sensitive and resource-constrained physical systems.

However, the flexibility of linguistic\ninstructions induces substantial ambiguity across language-conditioned tasks,\nseverely degrading algorithmic performance. To address these limitations, we\npresent a novel method named DAIL (Distributional Aligned Learning), featuring\ntwo key components: distributional policy and semantic alignment.

However, existing urban sensing systems struggle with limited\ngeneralization across diverse urban scenarios and poor interpretability in\ndecision-making. In this work, we introduce AgentSense, a hybrid, training-free\nframework that integrates large language models (LLMs) into participatory urban\nsensing through a multi-agent evolution system. AgentSense initially employs\nclassical planner to generate baseline solutions and then iteratively refines\nthem to adapt sensing task assignments to dynamic urban conditions and\nheterogeneous worker preferences, while producing natural language explanations\nthat enhance transparency and trust. Extensive experiments across two\nlarge-scale mobility datasets and seven types of dynamic disturbances\ndemonstrate that AgentSense offers distinct advantages in adaptivity and\nexplainability over traditional methods. Furthermore, compared to single-agent\nLLM baselines, our approach outperforms in both performance and robustness,\nwhile delivering more reasonable and transparent explanations.

In the current paradigm of training\ntransformer-based policies for embodied sequential decision-making tasks,\nvisual inputs often overwhelm the context limits of transformers, while humans\ncan maintain and utilize a lifetime of experience compressed as memories.\nSignificant compression is possible in principle, as much of the input is\nirrelevant and can be abstracted. However, existing approaches predominantly\nfocus on either recurrent models with fixed-size memory or transformers with\nfull-context reliance. In this work, we propose Memo, a transformer-based\narchitecture and training recipe for reinforcement learning (RL) on\nmemory-intensive, long-horizon tasks. Memo incorporates the creation and\nretrieval of memory by interleaving periodic summarization tokens with the\ninputs of a model during training. We demonstrate Memo's effectiveness on a\ngridworld meta-RL benchmark and a multi-object navigation task in\nphoto-realistic indoor settings.

Speculative decoding\nreduces this latency without sacrificing output quality, by leveraging a small\ndraft model to propose tokens that the larger target model verifies in\nparallel. In practice, however, there may exist a set of potential draft\nmodels- ranging from faster but less inaccurate, to slower yet more reliable.\nWe introduce Hierarchical Speculative Decoding (HSD), an algorithm that stacks\nthese draft models into a hierarchy, where each model proposes tokens, and the\nnext larger model verifies them in a single forward pass, until finally the\ntarget model verifies tokens. We derive an expression for the expected latency\nof any such hierarchy and show that selecting the latency-optimal hierarchy can\nbe done in polynomial time. Empirically, HSD gives up to 1.2x speed-up over the\nbest single-draft baseline, demonstrating the practicality of our algorithm in\nreducing generation latency beyond previous techniques.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ucd94\uc815 \ub514\ucf54\ub529(HSD) \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc0dd\uc131\uc758 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \uc904\uc774\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "Transformer \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc0dd\uc131 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uace0\uc790 \ud568.", "method": "HSD \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ucd08\uc548 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uacc4\uce35\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc313\uc544, \uac01\uac01\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud1a0\ud070\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0 \ub2e4\uc74c \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc774\ub97c \uac80\uc99d\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc124\uacc4\ud568.", "result": "HSD\ub294 \ucd5c\uc0c1\uc758 \ub2e8\uc77c \ucd08\uc548 \uae30\uc900\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ucd5c\ub300 1.2\ubc30\uc758 \uc18d\ub3c4 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud568.", "conclusion": "HSD \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \uc774\uc804 \uae30\uc220\uc744 \ub118\uc5b4\uc11c \uc0dd\uc131 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \uc904\uc774\ub294 \ub370 \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90c.", "translated_summary": "Transformers \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \uc790\uac00 \ud68c\uadc0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \ucd94\ub860 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc2dc\uac04\uc774 \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \ud1a0\ud070 \uc218\uc5d0 \ube44\ub840\ud558\uac8c \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd94\uce21\uc801 \ub514\ucf54\ub529\uc740 \uc791\uc740 \ucd08\uc548 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub354 \ud070 \ubaa9\ud45c \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ubcd1\ub82c\ub85c \uac80\uc99d\ud558\ub294 \ud1a0\ud070\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ucd9c\ub825 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \ud76c\uc0dd\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc774 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \uc904\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc2e4\uc81c\ub85c\ub294 \ub354 \ube60\ub974\uc9c0\ub9cc \ub35c \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ub290\ub9ac\uc9c0\ub9cc \ub354 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \ucd08\uc548 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc138\ud2b8\uac00 \uc874\uc7ac\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ucd08\uc548 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uacc4\uce35\uc73c\ub85c \uc313\ub294 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ucd94\uce21\uc801 \ub514\ucf54\ub529(HSD) \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac01 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ud1a0\ud070\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0 \ub2e4\uc74c \ub354 \ud070 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc774\ub97c \ub2e8\uc77c \ud3ec\uc6cc\ub4dc \ud328\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uba70 \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa9\ud45c \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud1a0\ud070\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacc4\uce35\uc758 \uc608\uc0c1 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud45c\ud604\uc2dd\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uace0, \uc9c0\uc5f0 \ucd5c\uc801 \uacc4\uce35\uc744 \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ub2e4\ud56d \uc2dc\uac04 \ub0b4\uc5d0 \uc218\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, HSD\ub294 \ucd5c\uc0c1\uc758 \ub2e8\uc77c \ucd08\uc548 \uae30\uc900\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ucd5c\ub300 1.2\ubc30\uc758 \uc18d\ub3c4 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\uc804 \uae30\uc220\uc744 \ub118\uc5b4\uc11c \uc0dd\uc131 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \uc904\uc774\ub294 \ub370 \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

To address this gap, we\npresent PROBE (Proactive Resolution Of BottlEnecks). PROBE decomposes\nproactivity as a pipeline of three core capabilities: (1) searching for\nunspecified issues, (2) identifying specific bottlenecks, and (3) executing\nappropriate resolutions. We apply PROBE to evaluate leading LLMs and popular\nagentic frameworks, showing that even state-of-the-art models struggle to solve\nthis benchmark. Computing our consistent measurements across frontier LLMs and\nagents, we find that the best end-to-end performance of 40% is achieved by both\nGPT-5 and Claude Opus-4.1.

To be reliable, CFXs must avoid regions of high\npredictive uncertainty, where explanations may be misleading or inapplicable.\nHowever, existing methods often neglect uncertainty or lack principled\nmechanisms for incorporating it with formal guarantees. We propose CONFEX, a\nnovel method for generating uncertainty-aware counterfactual explanations using\nConformal Prediction (CP) and Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP). CONFEX\nexplanations are designed to provide local coverage guarantees, addressing the\nissue that CFX generation violates exchangeability. To do so, we develop a\nnovel localised CP procedure that enjoys an efficient MILP encoding by\nleveraging an offline tree-based partitioning of the input space.

Current methods for learning and\nevaluating world models diverge from this goal: training and evaluation are\nanchored to next-frame prediction, and success is scored by reward maximization\nin the same environment. We propose WorldTest, a protocol to evaluate\nmodel-learning agents that separates reward-free interaction from a scored test\nphase in a different but related environment. WorldTest is\nopen-ended$\\unicode{x2014}$models should support many different tasks unknown\nahead of time$\\unicode{x2014}$and agnostic to model representation, allowing\ncomparison across approaches. We instantiated WorldTest with AutumnBench, a\nsuite of 43 interactive grid-world environments and 129 tasks across three\nfamilies: masked-frame prediction, planning, and predicting changes to the\ncausal dynamics. We compared 517 human participants and three frontier models\non AutumnBench. We found that humans outperform the models, and scaling compute\nimproves performance only in some environments but not others.
