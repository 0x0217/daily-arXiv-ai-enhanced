Such\napplications promise benefits but also raise many questions about agent\naccountability and value for users. Addressing these questions requires\nunderstanding how agents behave in realistic market conditions. However,\nprevious research has largely evaluated agents in constrained settings, such as\nsingle-task marketplaces (e.g., negotiation) or structured two-agent\ninteractions. Real-world markets are fundamentally different: they require\nagents to handle diverse economic activities and coordinate within large,\ndynamic ecosystems where multiple agents with opaque behaviors may engage in\nopen-ended dialogues. To bridge this gap, we investigate two-sided agentic\nmarketplaces where Assistant agents represent consumers and Service agents\nrepresent competing businesses. To study these interactions safely, we develop\nMagentic-Marketplace -- a simulated environment where Assistants and Services\ncan operate. This environment enables us to study key market dynamics: the\nutility agents achieve, behavioral biases, vulnerability to manipulation, and\nhow search mechanisms shape market outcomes. Our experiments show that frontier\nmodels can approach optimal welfare -- but only under ideal search conditions.\nPerformance degrades sharply with scale, and all models exhibit severe\nfirst-proposal bias, creating 10-30x advantages for response speed over\nquality. These findings reveal how behaviors emerge across market conditions,\ninforming the design of fair and efficient agentic marketplaces."}

The framework includes a\nself-interested market maker (Agent~A), which is trained in an uncertain\nenvironment shaped by an adversary, and three bottom-layer competitors: the\nself-interested Agent~B1 (whose objective is to maximize its own PnL), the\ncompetitive Agent~B2 (whose objective is to minimize the PnL of its opponent),\nand the hybrid Agent~B$^\\star$, which can modulate between the behavior of the\nother two.

Current approaches either ignore these biases,\nleading to suboptimal decisions, or require expensive calibration procedures\nthat are often infeasible in practice. This performance gap has real\nconsequences: inaccurate environmental monitoring, unreliable financial\npredictions, and flawed aggregation of human judgments. This paper addresses\nthe fundamental question: when can we learn and correct for these unknown\nbiases to recover near-optimal performance, and when is such learning futile?\nWe develop a theoretical framework that decomposes biases into learnable\nsystematic components and irreducible stochastic components, introducing the\nconcept of learnability ratio as the fraction of bias variance predictable from\nobservable covariates. This ratio determines whether bias learning is\nworthwhile for a given system. We prove that the achievable performance\nimprovement is fundamentally bounded by this learnability ratio, providing\nsystem designers with quantitative guidance on when to invest in bias learning\nversus simpler approaches. We present the Adaptive Bias Learning and Optimal\nCombining (ABLOC) algorithm, which iteratively learns bias-correcting\ntransformations while optimizing combination weights through closedform\nsolutions, guaranteeing convergence to these theoretical bounds.

We address dynamic vehicle\nrouting through a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for\ncoordinated, network-aware fleet navigation. We first propose Adaptive\nNavigation (AN), a decentralized MARL model where each intersection agent\nprovides routing guidance based on (i) local traffic and (ii) neighborhood\nstate modeled using Graph Attention Networks (GAT). To improve scalability in\nlarge networks, we further propose Hierarchical Hub-based Adaptive Navigation\n(HHAN), an extension of AN that assigns agents only to key intersections\n(hubs). Vehicles are routed hub-to-hub under agent control, while SPF handles\nmicro-routing within each hub region. For hub coordination, HHAN adopts\ncentralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) under the Attentive\nQ-Mixing (A-QMIX) framework, which aggregates asynchronous vehicle decisions\nvia attention. Hub agents use flow-aware state features that combine local\ncongestion and predictive dynamics for proactive routing.

Current methods for this task operate under a\nmodel-centric paradigm, selecting benchmarking items based on the collective\nperformance of existing models. Such approaches are limited by large upfront\ncosts, an inability to immediately handle new benchmarks (`cold-start'), and\nthe fragile assumption that future models will share the failure patterns of\ntheir predecessors. In this work, we challenge this paradigm and propose a\nitem-centric approach to benchmark subset selection, arguing that selection\nshould be based on the intrinsic properties of the task items themselves,\nrather than on model-specific failure patterns. We instantiate this\nitem-centric efficient benchmarking approach via a novel method, Scales++,\nwhere data selection is based on the cognitive demands of the benchmark\nsamples. Empirically, we show Scales++ reduces the upfront selection cost by\nover 18x while achieving competitive predictive fidelity. On the Open LLM\nLeaderboard, using just a 0.5\\% data subset, we predict full benchmark scores\nwith a 2.9% mean absolute error. We demonstrate that this item-centric approach\nenables more efficient model evaluation without significant fidelity\ndegradation, while also providing better cold-start performance and more\ninterpretable benchmarking."}

We\nstudy a minimal control interface where an agent chooses whether to act\nautonomously (play) or defer (ask), while a human simultaneously chooses\nwhether to be permissive (trust) or to engage in oversight (oversee). If the\nagent defers, the human's choice determines the outcome, potentially leading to\na corrective action or a system shutdown. We model this interaction as a\ntwo-player Markov Game. Our analysis focuses on cases where this game qualifies\nas a Markov Potential Game (MPG), a class of games where we can provide an\nalignment guarantee: under a structural assumption on the human's value\nfunction, any decision by the agent to act more autonomously that benefits\nitself cannot harm the human's value.

If the reward structures of the human-agent game\nmeet these conditions, we have a formal guarantee that the agent improving its\nown outcome will not harm the human's. Practically, this model motivates a\ntransparent control layer with predictable incentives where the agent learns to\ndefer when risky and act when safe, while its pretrained policy and the\nenvironment's reward structure remain untouched.

We\nstudy a minimal control interface where an agent chooses whether to act\nautonomously (play) or defer (ask), while a human simultaneously chooses\nwhether to be permissive (trust) or to engage in oversight (oversee). If the\nagent defers, the human's choice determines the outcome, potentially leading to\na corrective action or a system shutdown. We model this interaction as a\ntwo-player Markov Game. Our analysis focuses on cases where this game qualifies\nas a Markov Potential Game (MPG), a class of games where we can provide an\nalignment guarantee: under a structural assumption on the human's value\nfunction, any decision by the agent to act more autonomously that benefits\nitself cannot harm the human's value.

We first propose Adaptive\nNavigation (AN), a decentralized MARL model where each intersection agent\nprovides routing guidance based on (i) local traffic and (ii) neighborhood\nstate modeled using Graph Attention Networks (GAT). To improve scalability in\nlarge networks, we further propose Hierarchical Hub-based Adaptive Navigation\n(HHAN), an extension of AN that assigns agents only to key intersections\n(hubs). Vehicles are routed hub-to-hub under agent control, while SPF handles\nmicro-routing within each hub region. For hub coordination, HHAN adopts\ncentralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) under the Attentive\nQ-Mixing (A-QMIX) framework, which aggregates asynchronous vehicle decisions\nvia attention. Hub agents use flow-aware state features that combine local\ncongestion and predictive dynamics for proactive routing. Experiments on\nsynthetic grids and real urban maps (Toronto, Manhattan) show that AN reduces\naverage travel time versus SPF and learning baselines, maintaining 100% routing\nsuccess. HHAN scales to networks with hundreds of intersections, achieving up\nto 15.9% improvement under heavy traffic.
