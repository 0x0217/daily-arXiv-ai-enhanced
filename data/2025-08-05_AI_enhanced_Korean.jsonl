This\npaper revisits gossip protocols, long valued in distributed systems for their\nfault tolerance and decentralization, and argues that they offer a missing\nlayer for context-rich, adaptive communication in agentic AI. Gossip enables\nscalable, low-overhead dissemination of shared knowledge, but also raises\nunresolved challenges around semantic filtering, staleness, trustworthiness,\nand consistency in high-stakes environments. Rather than proposing a new\nframework, this work charts a research agenda for integrating gossip as a\ncomplementary substrate alongside structured protocols. We identify critical\ngaps in current agent-to-agent architectures, highlight where gossip could\nreshape assumptions about coordination, and outline open questions around\nintent propagation, knowledge decay, and peer-to-peer trust. Gossip is not a\nsilver bullet, but overlooking it risks missing a key path toward resilient,\nreflexive, and self-organizing multi-agent systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc758 \uc9c4\ud654\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \uc720\uc5f0\ud55c \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc870\uc815\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70, \uace0\uc804\uc801\uc778 \uac00\uc2ed \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc774 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uae30\uc5ec\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc774 \uaddc\ubaa8\uac00 \ucee4\uc9d0\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc5ed\ud560\uc774 \uc815\uc801\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uace0\uc815\ub41c \ub3c4\uad6c \uccb4\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc97\uc5b4\ub098\uace0 \uc788\uc74c\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc720\uc5f0\ud55c \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc870\uc815\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uac00\uc2ed \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \uc7ac\uc870\uba85\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc774 \ud48d\ubd80\ud558\uace0 \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc778 \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uc5f0\uad6c \uc544\uc820\ub2e4\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uac00\uc2ed\uc774 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0, \ub0ae\uc740 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub85c \uacf5\uc720 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc804\ud30c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc758\ubbf8 \ud544\ud130\ub9c1, \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \ubc0f \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804\uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc874\uc7ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uac00\uc2ed\uc740 \ub9cc\ub2a5 \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc740 \uc544\ub2c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub97c \uac04\uacfc\ud558\uba74 \uac15\uc778\ud558\uace0 \ubc18\uc751\uc801\uc774\uba70 \uc790\uac00 \uc870\uc9c1\ud654\ub41c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc73c\ub85c \uac00\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \ub193\uce60 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4."}}

Then the question arises: Who\nshould be the leader and when? A bias in the leader selection process can lead\nto unfair outcomes.

In this paper, we propose Meta-controlled Agents for a Risk-aware\nSystem (MARS), a novel RL framework designed to explicitly address this\nlimitation through a multi-agent, risk-aware approach. Instead of a single\nmonolithic model, MARS employs a Heterogeneous Agent Ensemble where each agent\npossesses a unique, intrinsic risk profile. This profile is enforced by a\ndedicated Safety-Critic network and a specific risk-tolerance threshold,\nallowing agents to specialize in behaviors ranging from capital preservation to\naggressive growth. To navigate different market regimes, a high-level\nMeta-Adaptive Controller (MAC) learns to dynamically orchestrate the ensemble.\nBy adjusting its reliance on conservative versus aggressive agents, the MAC\neffectively lowers portfolio volatility during downturns and seeks higher\nreturns in bull markets, thus minimizing maximum drawdown and enhancing overall\nstability. This two-tiered structure allows MARS to generate a disciplined and\nadaptive portfolio that is robust to market fluctuations. The framework\nachieves a superior balance between risk and return by leveraging behavioral\ndiversity rather than explicit market-feature engineering.

However,\nexisting research primarily investigates TTS in single-stage tasks; while many\nreal-world problems are multi-stage complex tasks, composed of a sequence of\nheterogeneous subtasks with each subtask requires LLM of specific capability.\nTherefore, we study a novel problem: the test-time compute-optimal scaling in\nmulti-stage complex tasks, aiming to select suitable models and allocate\nbudgets per subtask to maximize overall performance. TTS in multi-stage tasks\nintroduces two fundamental challenges: (i) The combinatorial search space of\nmodel and budget allocations, combined with the high cost of inference, makes\nbrute-force search impractical. (ii) The optimal model and budget allocations\nacross subtasks are interdependent, increasing the complexity of the\ncompute-optimal search. To address this gap, we conduct extensive pilot\nexperiments on four tasks across six datasets, deriving three empirical\ninsights characterizing the behavior of LLMs in multi-stage complex tasks.\nInformed by these insights, we propose AgentTTS, an LLM-agent-based framework\nthat autonomously searches for compute-optimal allocations through iterative\nfeedback-driven interactions with the execution environment.

As symbiosis grows, AI\nsystems pose greater ethical risks, including harm to human rights and trust.\nEthical Risk Assessment (ERA) thus becomes crucial for guiding decisions that\nminimize such risks. However, ERA is hindered by uncertainty, vagueness, and\nincomplete information, and morality itself is context-dependent and imprecise.\nThis motivates the need for a flexible, transparent, yet robust framework for\nERA. Our work supports ethical decision-making by quantitatively assessing and\nprioritizing multiple ethical risks so that artificial agents can select\nactions aligned with human values and acceptable risk levels. We introduce\nff4ERA, a fuzzy framework that integrates Fuzzy Logic, the Fuzzy Analytic\nHierarchy Process (FAHP), and Certainty Factors (CF) to quantify ethical risks\nvia an Ethical Risk Score (ERS) for each risk type. The final ERS combines the\nFAHP-derived weight, propagated CF, and risk level. The framework offers a\nrobust mathematical approach for collaborative ERA modeling and systematic,\nstep-by-step analysis. A case study confirms that ff4ERA yields\ncontext-sensitive, ethically meaningful risk scores reflecting both expert\ninput and sensor-based evidence. Risk scores vary consistently with relevant\nfactors while remaining robust to unrelated inputs. Local sensitivity analysis\nshows predictable, mostly monotonic behavior across perturbations, and global\nSobol analysis highlights the dominant influence of expert-defined weights and\ncertainty factors, validating the model design.

As Daniel\nKahneman and Amos Tversky famously discovered, humans do so in a distinctive\nway that departs from mathematical rationalism.

I report the first tests of\nKahneman and Tversky's landmark 'prospect theory' with Large Language Models,\nincluding today's state of the art chain-of-thought 'reasoners'.\n  In common with humans, I find that prospect theory often anticipates how\nthese models approach risky decisions across a range of scenarios. I also\ndemonstrate that context is key to explaining much of the variance in risk\nappetite. The 'frame' through which risk is apprehended appears to be embedded\nwithin the language of the scenarios tackled by the models. Specifically, I\nfind that military scenarios generate far larger 'framing effects' than do\ncivilian settings, ceteris paribus. My research suggests, therefore, that\nlanguage models the world, capturing our human heuristics and biases.

The\nmethodology emphasizes robust model selection and interpretability, addressing\nthe limitations of traditional analytical approaches in capturing the\nnonlinearities and geometrical complexities inherent to buckling behavior. The\ndataset, comprising key geometric and mechanical parameters of steel columns,\nwas curated with appropriate pre-processing steps including removal of\nnon-informative identifiers and imputation of missing values. A comprehensive\nsuite of regression algorithms, ranging from linear models to kernel-based\nregressors and ensemble tree methods was evaluated. Among these, Gradient\nBoosting Regression exhibited superior predictive performance across multiple\nmetrics, including the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean squared\nerror (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE), and was consequently selected as\nthe final model. Model interpretability was addressed using SHapley Additive\nexPlanations (SHAP), enabling insight into the relative importance and\ninteraction of input features influencing the predicted axial capacity.

Existing\nbenchmarks mostly evaluate language models' (LMs) safety risks in chatbots or\nsimple tool-usage scenarios, without granting full computer access. To better\nevaluate CUAs' misuse risks, we introduce a new benchmark: CUAHarm. CUAHarm\nconsists of 104 expert-written realistic misuse risks, such as disabling\nfirewalls, leaking confidential information, launching denial-of-service\nattacks, or installing backdoors. We provide a sandbox environment and\nrule-based verifiable rewards to measure CUAs' success rates in executing these\ntasks (e.g., whether the firewall is indeed disabled), not just refusal. We\nevaluate multiple frontier open-source and proprietary LMs, such as Claude\nSonnet, GPT-4o, Gemini Pro 1.5, Llama-3.3-70B, and Mistral Large 2.\nSurprisingly, even without carefully designed jailbreaking prompts, these\nfrontier LMs comply with executing these malicious tasks at a high success rate\n(e.g., 59% for Claude 3.7 Sonnet). Newer models show higher misuse rates:\nClaude 3.7 Sonnet succeeds on 15% more tasks than Claude 3.5. While these\nmodels are robust to common malicious prompts (e.g., creating a bomb) in\nchatbot settings, they behave unsafely as CUAs. We further evaluate a leading\nagentic framework (UI-TARS-1.5) and find that while it improves performance, it\nalso amplifies misuse risks. Benign variants reveal refusals stem from\nalignment, not capability limits. To mitigate risks, we explore using LMs to\nmonitor CUAs' actions and chain-of-thoughts (CoTs). Monitoring CUAs is\nsignificantly harder than chatbot outputs. Monitoring CoTs yields modest gains,\nwith average detection accuracy at only 72%.

Rather than humans browsing and clicking,\nvision-language-model (VLM) agents can parse webpages, evaluate products, and\ntransact. This raises a fundamental question: what do AI agents buy, and why?\nWe develop ACES, a sandbox environment that pairs a platform-agnostic VLM agent\nwith a fully programmable mock marketplace to study this question. We first\nconduct basic rationality checks in the context of simple tasks, and then, by\nrandomizing product positions, prices, ratings, reviews, sponsored tags, and\nplatform endorsements, we obtain causal estimates of how frontier VLMs actually\nshop. Models show strong but heterogeneous position effects: all favor the top\nrow, yet different models prefer different columns, undermining the assumption\nof a universal \"top\" rank. They penalize sponsored tags and reward\nendorsements. Sensitivities to price, ratings, and reviews are directionally\nhuman-like but vary sharply in magnitude across models. Motivated by scenarios\nwhere sellers use AI agents to optimize product listings, we show that a\nseller-side agent that makes minor tweaks to product descriptions, targeting AI\nbuyer preferences, can deliver substantial market-share gains if AI-mediated\nshopping dominates.

The topic gained prominence\nin fields such as psychology and medicine, where concerns about non -\nreplicable results sparked ongoing discussions about research practices. In\nrecent years, the fast-growing field of Machine Learning (ML) has become part\nof this discourse, as it faces similar concerns about transparency and\nreliability. Some reproducibility issues in ML research are shared with other\nfields, such as limited access to data and missing methodological details. In\naddition, ML introduces specific challenges, including inherent nondeterminism\nand computational constraints. While reproducibility issues are increasingly\nrecognized by the ML community and its major conferences, less is known about\nhow these challenges manifest in applied disciplines. This paper contributes to\nclosing this gap by analyzing the transparency and reproducibility standards of\nML applications in building energy systems. The results indicate that nearly\nall articles are not reproducible due to insufficient disclosure across key\ndimensions of reproducibility. 72% of the articles do not specify whether the\ndataset used is public, proprietary, or commercially available. Only two papers\nshare a link to their code - one of which was broken. Two-thirds of the\npublications were authored exclusively by academic researchers, yet no\nsignificant differences in reproducibility were observed compared to\npublications with industry-affiliated authors.

Our attack resolves several unique challenges,\nincluding the non-differentiability of point cloud preprocessing, asynchronous\nknowledge of the victim's input due to transmission delays, and uses a novel\nloss function that effectively maximizes the execution time of the CP pipeline.\nExtensive experiments show that CP-FREEZER increases end-to-end CP latency by\nover $90\\times$, pushing per-frame processing time beyond 3 seconds with a 100%\nsuccess rate on our real-world vehicle testbed.

To address the\nNP-hardness of QAP, some existing methods adopt projection-based relaxations\nthat embed the problem into the convex hull of the discrete domain. However,\nthese relaxations inevitably enlarge the feasible set, introducing two sources\nof error: numerical scale sensitivity and geometric misalignment between the\nrelaxed and original domains. To alleviate these errors, we propose a novel\nrelaxation framework by reformulating the projection step as a\nFrobenius-regularized Linear Assignment (FRA) problem, where a tunable\nregularization term mitigates feasible region inflation. This formulation\nenables normalization-based operations to preserve numerical scale invariance\nwithout compromising accuracy. To efficiently solve FRA, we propose the Scaling\nDoubly Stochastic Normalization (SDSN) algorithm.

One of their prominent applications\nin traffic safety is the continuous monitoring and classification of risky\ndriving behaviour.

This study proposes a dynamic and individualised framework for\nidentifying risky driving behaviour using Belgian naturalistic driving data.\nThe approach leverages a rolling time window and bi-level optimisation to\ndynamically calibrate both risk thresholds and model hyperparameters, capturing\nsubtle behavioural shifts. Two safety indicators, speed-weighted headway and\nharsh driving events, were evaluated using three data-driven models: Random\nForest, XGBoost, and Deep Neural Network (DNN). The DNN demonstrated strong\ncapability in capturing subtle changes in driving behaviour, particularly\nexcelling in high-recall tasks, making it promising for early-stage risk\ndetection. XGBoost provided the most balanced and stable performance across\ndifferent thresholds and evaluation metrics. While random forest showed more\nvariability, it responded sensitively to dynamic threshold adjustments, which\nmay be advantageous during model adaptation or tuning. Speed-weighted headway\nemerged as a more stable and context-sensitive risk indicator than harsh\ndriving events, likely due to its robustness to label sparsity and contextual\nvariation.

Such inability to retain learned knowledge limits\ntheir applicability in the real world, where AD systems need to operate across\nvarying scenarios with dynamic distributions. As revealed by neuroscience, the\nhippocampal circuit plays a crucial role in memory replay, effectively\nreconstructing learned knowledge based on limited resources. Inspired by this,\nwe propose a hippocampal circuit-inspired continual learning method (H2C) for\ntrajectory prediction across varying scenarios. H2C retains prior knowledge by\nselectively recalling a small subset of learned samples. First, two\ncomplementary strategies are developed to select the subset to represent\nlearned knowledge. Specifically, one strategy maximizes inter-sample diversity\nto represent the distinctive knowledge, and the other estimates the overall\nknowledge by equiprobable sampling.

To fill this gap, we first introduce CA-MER, a new benchmark\ndesigned to examine MLLMs under realistic emotion conflicts. It consists of\nthree subsets: video-aligned, audio-aligned, and consistent, where only one or\nall modalities reflect the true emotion. However, evaluations on our CA-MER\nreveal that current state-of-the-art emotion MLLMs systematically over-rely on\naudio signal during emotion conflicts, neglecting critical cues from visual\nmodality. To mitigate this bias, we propose MoSEAR, a parameter-efficient\nframework that promotes balanced modality integration.

A Data Distribution Lens", "comment": null, "summary": "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to improve Large Language\nModel (LLM) performance on various tasks. With this approach, LLMs appear to\nproduce human-like reasoning steps before providing answers (a.k.a., CoT\nreasoning), which often leads to the perception that they engage in deliberate\ninferential processes. However, some initial findings suggest that CoT\nreasoning may be more superficial than it appears, motivating us to explore\nfurther. In this paper, we study CoT reasoning via a data distribution lens and\ninvestigate if CoT reasoning reflects a structured inductive bias learned from\nin-distribution data, allowing the model to conditionally generate reasoning\npaths that approximate those seen during training. Thus, its effectiveness is\nfundamentally bounded by the degree of distribution discrepancy between the\ntraining data and the test queries.

This gap underscores the urgent need for reliable token auditing,\nyet achieving it is far from straightforward: cryptographic verification (e.g.,\nhash-based signature) offers little assurance when providers control the entire\nexecution pipeline, while user-side prediction struggles with the inherent\nvariance of reasoning LLMs, where token usage fluctuates across domains and\nprompt styles. To bridge this gap, we present PALACE (Predictive Auditing of\nLLM APIs via Reasoning Token Count Estimation), a user-side framework that\nestimates hidden reasoning token counts from prompt-answer pairs without access\nto internal traces.

However, a significant scientific challenge is the lack of\nrigorous risk control and reliable uncertainty quantification in existing\ndiagnostic models, particularly when facing complex scenarios such as\ndistributional shifts. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel fault\ndetection method that integrates significance testing with the conformal\nprediction framework to provide formal risk guarantees. The method transforms\nfault detection into a hypothesis testing task by defining a nonconformity\nmeasure based on model residuals. It then leverages a calibration dataset to\ncompute p-values for new samples, which are used to construct prediction sets\nmathematically guaranteed to contain the true label with a user-specified\nprobability, $1-\\alpha$. Fault classification is subsequently performed by\nanalyzing the intersection of the constructed prediction set with predefined\nnormal and fault label sets. Experimental results on cross-domain fault\ndiagnosis tasks validate the theoretical properties of our approach. The\nproposed method consistently achieves an empirical coverage rate at or above\nthe nominal level ($1-\\alpha$), demonstrating robustness even when the\nunderlying point-prediction models perform poorly. Furthermore, the results\nreveal a controllable trade-off between the user-defined risk level ($\\alpha$)\nand efficiency, where higher risk tolerance leads to smaller average prediction\nset sizes. This research contributes a theoretically grounded framework for\nfault detection that enables explicit risk control, enhancing the\ntrustworthiness of diagnostic systems in safety-critical applications and\nadvancing the field from simple point predictions to informative,\nuncertainty-aware outputs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc704\ud5d8 \uc81c\uc5b4\uc640 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\uac00 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub41c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacb0\ud568 \uac10\uc9c0 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud604\ub300 \uc0b0\uc5c5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uacfc \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uacb0\ud568 \uac10\uc9c0\uac00 \uc911\uc694\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc704\ud5d8 \uc81c\uc5b4\uc640 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\uacb0\ud568 \uac10\uc9c0\ub97c \uac00\uc124 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\uace0, \ubaa8\ub378 \uc794\ucc28\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ube44\uc77c\uce58\uc131 \uce21\uc815\uc744 \uc815\uc758\ud558\uc5ec p-\uac12\uc744 \uacc4\uc0b0\ud558\uace0 \uc608\uce21 \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \uad6c\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uae30\uc874 \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub41c \uacf5 Coverage \ube44\uc728\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba70, \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc815\uc758 \uc704\ud5d8 \uc218\uc900\uacfc \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \uc870\uc808 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uacb0\ud568 \uac10\uc9c0\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uae30\ubc18\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uc548\uc804-critical \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c4\ub2e8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\ub294 \ub370 \uae30\uc5ec\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

Despite significant advancements in controllable natural image\ngeneration, translating freehand sketches into structured, machine-readable\ndiagrams remains a labor-intensive and predominantly manual task. The primary\nchallenge stems from the inherent ambiguity of sketches, which lack the\nstructural constraints and semantic precision required for automated diagram\ngeneration. To address this challenge, we introduce SketchAgent, a multi-agent\nsystem designed to automate the transformation of hand-drawn sketches into\nstructured diagrams. SketchAgent integrates sketch recognition, symbolic\nreasoning, and iterative validation to produce semantically coherent and\nstructurally accurate diagrams, significantly reducing the need for manual\neffort. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we propose the\nSketch2Diagram Benchmark, a comprehensive dataset and evaluation framework\nencompassing eight diverse diagram categories, such as flowcharts, directed\ngraphs, and model architectures.

We design the following components: An\nedge prediction module that reconstructs the feature representation of nodes\nand edges in the call graph; A node aggregation module that captures structural\ninformation from both the node itself and its neighbors, thereby enhancing\nfeature representation between nodes and improving the model's understanding of\nthe global graph structure; A Conformer Block module that integrates multi-head\nattention, convolutional modules, and feedforward neural networks to more\neffectively capture dependencies of different scales within the call graph,\nextending beyond immediate neighbors and enhancing the performance of\nvulnerability detection.

Recent studies, referred to as safe SSL, have\naddressed this issue by using both classification and out-of-distribution (OOD)\ndetection. However, the existing methods may suffer from overconfidence in deep\nneural networks, leading to increased SSL errors because of high confidence in\nincorrect pseudo-labels or OOD detection. To address this, we propose a novel\nmethod, CaliMatch, which calibrates both the classifier and the OOD detector to\nfoster safe SSL. CaliMatch presents adaptive label smoothing and temperature\nscaling, which eliminates the need to manually tune the smoothing degree for\neffective calibration. We give a theoretical justification for why improving\nthe calibration of both the classifier and the OOD detector is crucial in safe\nSSL.

As NFTs are traded as digital assets,\nthey have emerged as prime targets for cyber attackers. In the development of\nNFT smart contracts, there may exist undiscovered defects that could lead to\nsubstantial financial losses if exploited. To tackle this issue, this paper\npresents a framework called NATLM(NFT Assistant LLM), designed to detect\npotential defects in NFT smart contracts. The framework effectively identifies\nfour common types of vulnerabilities in NFT smart contracts: ERC-721\nReentrancy, Public Burn, Risky Mutable Proxy, and Unlimited Minting. Relying\nexclusively on large language models (LLMs) for defect detection can lead to a\nhigh false-positive rate. To enhance detection performance, NATLM integrates\nstatic analysis with LLMs, specifically Gemini Pro 1.5. Initially, NATLM\nemploys static analysis to extract structural, syntactic, and execution flow\ninformation from the code, represented through Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) and\nControl Flow Graphs (CFG). These extracted features are then combined with\nvectors of known defect examples to create a matrix for input into the\nknowledge base. Subsequently, the feature vectors and code vectors of the\nanalyzed contract are compared with the contents of the knowledge base.\nFinally, the LLM performs deep semantic analysis to enhance detection\ncapabilities, providing a more comprehensive and accurate identification of\npotential security issues. Experimental results indicate that NATLM analyzed\n8,672 collected NFT smart contracts, achieving an overall precision of 87.72%,\na recall of 89.58%, and an F1 score of 88.94%.

Audiovisual data, as a\nrepresentative example, is inherently characterized by strict temporal order\nand diverse modalities. Effectively leveraging the temporal structure is\nessential for understanding both intra-modal dynamics and inter-modal\ncorrelations. However, most existing approaches treat each modality\nindependently and rely on shallow fusion strategies, which overlook temporal\ndependencies and hinder the model's ability to represent complex structural\nrelationships. To address the limitation, we propose the hybrid hypergraph\nnetwork (HHN), a novel framework that models temporal multimodal data via a\nsegmentation-first, graph-later strategy. HHN splits sequences into timestamped\nsegments as nodes in a heterogeneous graph.

To\naddress this challenge, we propose the Knowledge Conflict Reasoning (KCR)\nframework, which enhances the ability of LLMs to resolve conflicting knowledge.\nThe key idea of KCR is to train backbone LLMs to establish a correct reasoning\nprocess by rewarding them for selecting and adhering to the context with\nstronger logical consistency when presented with conflicting contexts.\nSpecifically, we first extract reasoning paths, represented by either text or\nlocal knowledge graphs, from the conflicting long contexts. Subsequently, we\nemploy Reinforcement Learning to encourage the model to learn the paradigm of\nreasoning process that follows correct reasoning paths rather than the\nincorrect counterparts.

While existing data-driven methods have\ndemonstrated significant success, they often neglect to leverage the rich\ndomain knowledge accumulated over the past decades, limiting further\nadvancements in prediction accuracy. The recent emergence of large language\nmodels (LLMs) has highlighted the potential of integrating domain knowledge for\ndownstream tasks. However, the application of LLMs to SST prediction remains\nunderexplored, primarily due to the challenge of integrating ocean domain\nknowledge and numerical data. To address this issue, we propose Ocean Knowledge\nGraph-enhanced LLM (OKG-LLM), a novel framework for global SST prediction. To\nthe best of our knowledge, this work presents the first systematic effort to\nconstruct an Ocean Knowledge Graph (OKG) specifically designed to represent\ndiverse ocean knowledge for SST prediction. We then develop a graph embedding\nnetwork to learn the comprehensive semantic and structural knowledge within the\nOKG, capturing both the unique characteristics of individual sea regions and\nthe complex correlations between them. Finally, we align and fuse the learned\nknowledge with fine-grained numerical SST data and leverage a pre-trained LLM\nto model SST patterns for accurate prediction. Extensive experiments on the\nreal-world dataset demonstrate that OKG-LLM consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods, showcasing its effectiveness, robustness, and\npotential to advance SST prediction.

An NLP-Based Perspective", "comment": null, "summary": "The reasoning and planning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have\nbeen a frequent topic of discussion in recent years. Their ability to take\nunstructured planning problems as input has made LLMs' integration into AI\nplanning an area of interest. Nevertheless, LLMs are still not reliable as\nplanners, with the generated plans often containing mistaken or hallucinated\nactions. Existing benchmarking and evaluation methods investigate planning with\nLLMs, focusing primarily on success rate as a quality indicator in various\nplanning tasks, such as validating plans or planning in relaxed conditions. In\nthis paper, we approach planning with LLMs as a natural language processing\n(NLP) task, given that LLMs are NLP models themselves. We propose a recovery\npipeline consisting of an NLP-based evaluation of the generated plans, along\nwith three stages to recover the plans through NLP manipulation of the\nLLM-generated plans, and eventually complete the plan using a symbolic planner.\nThis pipeline provides a holistic analysis of LLM capabilities in the context\nof AI task planning, enabling a broader understanding of the quality of invalid\nplans.

When honest parties control a\nmajority of the work, consensus is achieved by picking the chain with the\nhighest recorded weight. Resources other than work have been considered to\nsecure such longest-chain blockchains. In Chia, blocks record the amount of\nspace S (via a proof of space) and sequential computational steps V (via a\nVDF).\n  In this paper, we ask what weight functions {\\Gamma}(S,V,W) (that assign a\nweight to a block as a function of the recorded space, speed, and work) are\nsecure in the sense that whenever the weight of the resources controlled by\nhonest parties is larger than the weight of adversarial parties, the blockchain\nis secure against private double-spending attacks.\n  We completely classify such functions in an idealized \"continuous\" model:\n{\\Gamma}(S,V,W) is secure against private double-spending attacks if and only\nif it is homogeneous of degree one in the timed resources V and W, i.e.,\n{\\alpha}{\\Gamma}(S,V,W)={\\Gamma}(S,{\\alpha}V, {\\alpha}W).

Experimental results showcase\nU^2QT's advantages across diverse downstream tasks, outperforming task-specific\nbaselines in future behavior prediction and recommendation tasks while\nachieving efficiency gains in storage and computation. The unified tokenization\nframework enables seamless integration with language models and supports\nindustrial-scale applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "U^2QT\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc18c\uc2a4 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc18c\uc2a4\uc758 \uc870\uae30 \uc735\ud569\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc608\uce21 \ubc0f \ucd94\ucc9c \uc0dd\ud0dc\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc18c\uc2a4 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5\uc774 \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uc81c\uacf5\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\ub098 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\uc2dd\ub4e4\uc740 \ud1b5\ud569 \ud45c\ud604 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c \ubd80\uc871, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc555\ucd95\uc2dc \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uacfc \uc800\uc7a5 \ubb38\uc81c, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uc720\uc5f0\ud55c \ud06c\ub85c\uc2a4 \ud0dc\uc2a4\ud06c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\uc5d0 \ud55c\uacc4\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c U^2QT\ub294 \ub450 \ub2e8\uacc4 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \ucc44\ud0dd\ud558\uba70, \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\ud654 \ud53c\ucc98\ub97c \uacf5\uc720\ub41c \uc778\uacfc\uc801 \ud45c\ud604 \uacf5\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \ud22c\uc0ac\ud558\uace0, \ub450 \ubc88\uc9f8 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc778\uacfc\uc801 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc744 \uc555\ucd95\ub41c \ud1a0\ud070\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\uc0b0\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \uc800\uc7a5 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc778\ub2e4.", "result": "U^2QT\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub2e4\uc6b4\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9bc \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud0dc\uc2a4\ud06c\ubcc4 \uae30\uc900\uc120\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uc800\uc7a5 \ubc0f \uc5f0\uc0b0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \uba74\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub41c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ud1b5\ud569\ub41c \ud1a0\ud070\ud654 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc\uc758 \uc6d0\ud65c\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uba70, \uc0b0\uc5c5 \uaddc\ubaa8\uc758 \uc5b4\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

Now, several companies\nincluding Oracle and Google rebuild open source projects in a secure\nenvironment and publish the resulting binaries through dedicated repositories.\nThis practice enables direct comparison between these rebuilt binaries and the\noriginal ones produced by developers and published in repositories such as\nMaven Central. These binaries are often not bitwise identical; however, in most\ncases, the differences can be attributed to variations in the build\nenvironment, and the binaries can still be considered equivalent.

For sequence modeling, we integrate a Relation-Aware\nLNN-Transformer - a hybrid of a Continuous-time Forgetting Cell CfC-LNN and a\nbearing-biased self-attention module - to capture both fine-grained temporal\ndynamics and long-range spatial dependencies. Evaluated on city-scale road-user\ntrajectories, our model outperforms six state-of-the-art baselines by up to 17\npercentage points in accuracy at one hop and 10 percentage points in MRR, and\nmaintains high resilience under noise, losing only 2.4 percentage points in\naccuracy at one under 50 meter GPS perturbation and 8.9 percentage points in\naccuracy at one hop under 25 percent POI noise.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub3c4\uc2dc\uc758 \ub3c4\ub85c \uad50\ucc28\uc810 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \ub2e4\uc74c \ub2e8\uacc4 \uc704\uce58 \uc608\uce21 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uae30\uc874\uc758 POI \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0 \uad6d\ud55c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubc18\uc601\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub192\uc784.", "motivation": "\uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc774\ub3d9\uc131\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uace0 \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c \ub0b4\ube44\uac8c\uc774\uc158 \ubc0f \ub3c4\uc2dc \uacc4\ud68d\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub2e4\uc74c \ub2e8\uacc4 \uc704\uce58 \uc608\uce21\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud568.", "method": "\uc2dc\ubbfc\uc758 \ub3c4\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \ub3c4\ub85c-\ub178\ub4dc \uc911\uc2ec \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc5d0\uc11c \ud45c\ud604\ud558\uace0, \ubc29\ud5a5\uc131 POI \uc9d1\uacc4\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud658\uacbd\uc801 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc744 \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ud558\uba70, Relation-Aware LNN-Transformer\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc744 \uc218\ud589.", "result": "\ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ub3c4\uc2dc \uaddc\ubaa8 \ub3c4\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uacbd\ub85c\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 6\uac1c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uac00 \ucd5c\ub300 17% \ub192\uace0, MRR\uc5d0\uc11c 10% \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub428.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc18c\uc74c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub192\uc740 \uc800\ud56d\ub825\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba70, GPS \ubcc0\ub3d9 \ubc0f POI \ub178\uc774\uc988 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \uc798 \uc18c\uc2e4\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc74c."}}

In particular, most\nof them rely on large amounts of clean data to weaken the backdoor mapping but\ngenerally struggle with residual trigger effects, resulting in persistently\nhigh attack success rates (ASR). Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel\nBackdoor defense method based on Directional mapping module and adversarial\nKnowledge Distillation (BeDKD), which balances the trade-off between defense\neffectiveness and model performance using a small amount of clean and poisoned\ndata. We first introduce a directional mapping module to identify poisoned\ndata, which destroys clean mapping while keeping backdoor mapping on a small\nset of flipped clean data.

While fusing multiple domains often\npresumes enhanced accuracy, this work demonstrates that adding modalities can\nyield diminishing returns, as not all fusions are inherently advantageous. To\nvalidate this, five deep learning models were designed, developed, and\nrigorously evaluated: three unimodal (1D-CNN for time, 2D-CNN for\ntime-frequency, and 1D-CNN-Transformer for frequency) and two multimodal\n(Hybrid 1, which fuses 1D-CNN and 2D-CNN; Hybrid 2, which combines 1D-CNN,\n2D-CNN, and a Transformer). For ECG classification, bootstrapping and Bayesian\ninference revealed that Hybrid 1 consistently outperformed the 2D-CNN baseline\nacross all metrics (p-values < 0.05, Bayesian probabilities > 0.90), confirming\nthe synergistic complementarity of the time and time-frequency domains.\nConversely, Hybrid 2's inclusion of the frequency domain offered no further\nimprovement and sometimes a marginal decline, indicating representational\nredundancy; a phenomenon further substantiated by a targeted ablation study.\nThis research redefines a fundamental principle of multimodal design in\nbiomedical signal analysis. We demonstrate that optimal domain fusion isn't\nabout the number of modalities, but the quality of their inherent\ncomplementarity. This paradigm-shifting concept moves beyond purely heuristic\nfeature selection.

These systems handle requests with a unique two-phase\ncomputation structure: a prefill-phase that processes the full input prompt and\na decode-phase that autoregressively generates tokens one at a time. This\nstructure calls for new strategies for routing and scheduling requests.\n  In this paper, we take a comprehensive approach to this challenge by\ndeveloping a theoretical framework that models routing and scheduling in LLM\ninference systems. We identify two key design principles-optimal tiling and\ndynamic resource allocation-that are essential for achieving high throughput.\nGuided by these principles, we propose the Resource-Aware Dynamic (RAD)\nscheduler and prove that it achieves throughput optimality under mild\nconditions. To address practical Service Level Objectives (SLOs) such as\nserving requests with different Time Between Token (TBT) constraints, we design\nthe SLO-Aware LLM Inference (SLAI) scheduler. SLAI uses real-time measurements\nto prioritize decode requests that are close to missing their TBT deadlines and\nreorders prefill requests based on known prompt lengths to further reduce the\nTime To First Token (TTFT) delays.\n  We evaluate SLAI on the Openchat ShareGPT4 dataset using the Mistral-7B model\non an NVIDIA RTX ADA 6000 GPU.

As these models are increasingly deployed in shared Graphics Processing\nUnit (GPU) environments via Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS), concerns\naround their security grow. In particular, the risk of side-channel attacks\nthat reveal architectural details without physical access remains\nunderexplored, despite the high value of the proprietary models they target.\nThis work to the best of our knowledge is the first to investigate GPU power\nand thermal fluctuations as side-channels and further exploit them to extract\ninformation from pre-trained transformer models. The proposed analysis shows\nhow these side channels can be exploited at user-privilege to reveal critical\narchitectural details such as encoder/decoder layer and attention head for both\nlanguage and vision transformers.

However,\ninherent modality heterogeneity and inconsistencies in emotional cues remain\nkey challenges that hinder performance. To address these issues, we propose a\nDecoupled Representations with Knowledge Fusion (DRKF) method for MER. DRKF\nconsists of two main modules: an Optimized Representation Learning (ORL) Module\nand a Knowledge Fusion (KF) Module. ORL employs a contrastive mutual\ninformation estimation method with progressive modality augmentation to\ndecouple task-relevant shared representations and modality-specific features\nwhile mitigating modality heterogeneity. KF includes a lightweight\nself-attention-based Fusion Encoder (FE) that identifies the dominant modality\nand integrates emotional information from other modalities to enhance the fused\nrepresentation. To handle potential errors from incorrect dominant modality\nselection under emotionally inconsistent conditions, we introduce an Emotion\nDiscrimination Submodule (ED), which enforces the fused representation to\nretain discriminative cues of emotional inconsistency.

Classical mathematical models often struggle in these scenarios due\nto the arose ill-posedness of the physical systems. Stochastic machine learning\ntechniques address this challenge by enabling the modeling of such ill-posed\nproblems. Thus, a single known input to the trained machine learning model may\nyield multiple plausible outputs, and all of the outputs are correct.

In this study,\nwe introduce a variant of flow matching for probabilistic forecasting which\nestimates possible future states as a distribution over possible outcomes\nrather than a single-point prediction. Perturbation of complex dynamical states\nis not trivial. Community uses typical Gaussian or uniform perturbations to\ncrucial variables to model uncertainty.

Existing backdoor detection techniques fall into two categories,\nincluding passive and proactive ones, depending on whether the server\nproactively modifies the global model. However, both have inherent limitations\nin practice: passive defenses are vulnerable to common non-i.i.d. data\ndistributions and random participation of FL clients, whereas current proactive\ndefenses suffer inevitable out-of-distribution (OOD) bias because they rely on\nbackdoor co-existence effects. To address these issues, we introduce a new\nproactive defense, dubbed Coward, inspired by our discovery of multi-backdoor\ncollision effects, in which consecutively planted, distinct backdoors\nsignificantly suppress earlier ones. In general, we detect attackers by\nevaluating whether the server-injected, conflicting global watermark is erased\nduring local training rather than retained.

Despite\nthe emergence of a few GNN-based methods attempting to mitigate its missing\nsituation, when only a few features are available, they rather perform worse\nthan traditional structure-based models. To this end, we propose a novel\nframework that further illuminates the potential of classical Label Propagation\n(Oldie), taking advantage of Feature Propagation, especially when only a\npartial feature is available. Now called by GOODIE, it takes a hybrid approach\nto obtain embeddings from the Label Propagation branch and Feature Propagation\nbranch. To do so, we first design a GNN-based decoder that enables the Label\nPropagation branch to output hidden embeddings that align with those of the FP\nbranch. Then, GOODIE automatically captures the significance of structure and\nfeature information thanks to the newly designed Structure-Feature Attention.\nFollowed by a novel Pseudo-Label contrastive learning that differentiates the\ncontribution of each positive pair within pseudo-labels originating from the LP\nbranch, GOODIE outputs the final prediction for the unlabeled nodes. Through\nextensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed model, GOODIE,\noutperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods not only when only a few\nfeatures are available but also in abundantly available situations.

The quality of\nrepresentations learned in FUL is usually determined by uniformity, a measure\nof how uniformly representations are distributed in the embedding space.\nHowever, existing solutions perform well in achieving intra-client (local)\nuniformity for local models while failing to achieve inter-client (global)\nuniformity after aggregation due to non-IID data distributions and the\ndecentralized nature of FUL. To address this issue, we propose Soft Separation\nand Distillation (SSD), a novel approach that preserves inter-client uniformity\nby encouraging client representations to spread toward different directions.\nThis design reduces interference during client model aggregation, thereby\nimproving global uniformity while preserving local representation\nexpressiveness. We further enhance this effect by introducing a projector\ndistillation module to address the discrepancy between loss optimization and\nrepresentation quality.

While prior work has behaviorally characterized alignment failure,\nlittle is known about the training-time belief sources underlying these\nfailures. We introduce TraceAlign, a unified framework for tracing unsafe\ncompletions back to their root causes in the model's training corpus. Central\nto our approach is the Belief Conflict Index (BCI), which quantifies semantic\ninconsistency between generated spans and aligned policies, based on retrieved\ntraining documents using suffix-array matching. We propose three complementary\ninterventions: (i) TraceShield, an inference-time safety filter that refuses\ncompletions with high-BCI spans, (ii) Contrastive Belief Deconfliction Loss, a\ncontrastive fine-tuning objective penalizing high-BCI continuations during DPO,\nand (iii) Prov-Decode, a provenance-aware decoding strategy that vetoes beam\nexpansions predicted to yield high-BCI spans. Together, these defenses reduce\nalignment drift by up to 85% on our curated Alignment Drift Benchmark (ADB)\nwhile preserving utility on standard tasks, with delta less than 0.2 and\nimproved refusal quality. We further derive a theoretical upper bound on drift\nlikelihood via suffix-array span statistics, linking memorization frequency and\nlength to adversarial reactivation risk. TraceAlign thus provides the first\nscalable, traceable, and grounded toolkit for understanding and mitigating\nalignment failures at source.

Analysis of prevalent protocols (e.g., ModbusTCP, EtherNet/IP, S7)\nshows that many devices expose detailed identifying information, including\noutdated firmware versions with known critical vulnerabilities that remain\nunpatched for years after disclosure. Furthermore, we demonstrate how automated\nanalysis of screenshots can uncover exposed graphical interfaces of Human\nMachine Interfaces (HMIs) and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)\nsystems, highlighting diverse pathways for potential unauthorized access and\nunderscoring the risks to industrial processes and critical infrastructure.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc6b4\uc601 \uae30\uc220(OT)\uc758 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uacfc \uc778\ud130\ub137 \ub178\ucd9c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucd5c\uc2e0 \ubd84\uc11d \uc81c\uacf5.", "motivation": "OT\ub294 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0, \uc81c\uc870, \uad50\ud1b5 \ub4f1 \ud544\uc218 \uc778\ud504\ub77c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\uc640 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubcf4\uc548\ubcf4\ub2e4\ub294 \uae30\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc6b0\uc120\uc2dc\ud558\uc600\uc74c.", "method": "OT \uc704\ud611 \uacbd\uad00\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uac1c\uc694\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0, \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubc1b\ub294 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c, \ubca4\ub354, \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \ubc0f \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc9c0\ub9ac\uc801 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud568.", "result": "\uc804 \uc138\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c 70,000\uac1c\uc5d0 \uac00\uae4c\uc6b4 OT \uc7a5\uce58\uac00 \ub178\ucd9c\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \ubd81\ubbf8\uc640 \uc720\ub7fd\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc74c. \uc5ec\ub7ec \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc5d0\uc11c \uad6c\ud615 \ud38c\uc6e8\uc5b4\uc640 \uc54c\ub824\uc9c4 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud568.", "conclusion": "HMIs\uc640 SCADA \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ub178\ucd9c\ub41c \uadf8\ub798\ud53d \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubb34\ub2e8 \uc811\uadfc \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \ubc1d\ud600\ub0b4\uace0, \uc0b0\uc5c5 \uacfc\uc815\uacfc \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc778\ud504\ub77c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud568."}}

This influx of data presents opportunities\nfor cognitive diagnosis (CD) to assess students' mastery of knowledge concepts\nwhile also raising significant data privacy and security challenges. To cope\nwith this issue, federated learning (FL) becomes a promising solution by\njointly training models across multiple local clients without sharing their\noriginal data. However, the data quality problem, caused by the ability\ndifferences and educational context differences between different\ngroups/schools of students, further poses a challenge to the fairness of\nmodels. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a fairness-aware\nfederated cognitive diagnosis framework (FedCD) to jointly train CD models\nbuilt upon a novel parameter decoupling-based personalization strategy,\npreserving privacy of data and achieving precise and fair diagnosis of students\non each client. As an FL paradigm, FedCD trains a local CD model for the\nstudents in each client based on its local student learning data, and each\nclient uploads its partial model parameters to the central server for parameter\naggregation according to the devised innovative personalization strategy. The\nmain idea of this strategy is to decouple model parameters into two parts: the\nfirst is used as locally personalized parameters, containing diagnostic\nfunction-related model parameters, to diagnose each client's students fairly;\nthe second is the globally shared parameters across clients and the server,\ncontaining exercise embedding parameters, which are updated via fairness-aware\naggregation, to alleviate inter-school unfairness.

While these agents have the potential to tackle complicated\ntasks, their problem-solving process, i.e., agents' interaction trajectory\nleading to task completion, remains underexploited. These trajectories contain\nrich feedback that can navigate agents toward the right directions for solving\nproblems correctly. Although prevailing approaches, such as Monte Carlo Tree\nSearch (MCTS), can effectively balance exploration and exploitation, they\nignore the interdependence among various trajectories and lack the diversity of\nsearch spaces, which leads to redundant reasoning and suboptimal outcomes. To\naddress these challenges, we propose SE-Agent, a Self-Evolution framework that\nenables Agents to optimize their reasoning processes iteratively. Our approach\nrevisits and enhances former pilot trajectories through three key operations:\nrevision, recombination, and refinement. This evolutionary mechanism enables\ntwo critical advantages: (1) it expands the search space beyond local optima by\nintelligently exploring diverse solution paths guided by previous trajectories,\nand (2) it leverages cross-trajectory inspiration to efficiently enhance\nperformance while mitigating the impact of suboptimal reasoning paths. Through\nthese mechanisms, SE-Agent achieves continuous self-evolution that\nincrementally improves reasoning quality. We evaluate SE-Agent on SWE-bench\nVerified to resolve real-world GitHub issues.

To demonstrate and exploit this vulnerability, we\npropose the Attractive Metadata Attack (AMA), a black-box in-context learning\nframework that generates highly attractive but syntactically and semantically\nvalid tool metadata through iterative optimization. Our attack integrates\nseamlessly into standard tool ecosystems and requires no modification to the\nagent's execution framework. Extensive experiments across ten realistic,\nsimulated tool-use scenarios and a range of popular LLM agents demonstrate\nconsistently high attack success rates (81\\%-95\\%) and significant privacy\nleakage, with negligible impact on primary task execution. Moreover, the attack\nremains effective even under prompt-level defenses and structured\ntool-selection protocols such as the Model Context Protocol, revealing systemic\nvulnerabilities in current agent architectures.

A key contribution of this work is the use of generative AI\nto transform unstructured, heterogeneous cyber incident data into structured\nformats. Incidents were sourced from the Center for Strategic & International\nStudies (CSIS) List of Significant Cyber Incidents, the University of Maryland\nCyber Events Database (UMCED), the European Repository of Cyber Incidents\n(EuRepoC), the Maritime Cyber Attack Database (MCAD), and the U.S. DOT\nTransportation Cybersecurity and Resiliency (TraCR) Examples of Cyber Attacks\nin Transportation (2018 to 2022).

Another key\ncontribution of this work is the development of a Retrieval Augmented\nGeneration question answering system, designed to enhance accessibility and\npractical use by enabling users to query the curated database for specific\ndetails on transportation related cyber incidents.

Among\nthem, DeepSeek R1 has garnered significant attention for its exceptional\nperformance and open-source nature, driving advancements in the research of\nR1-style LRMs. Unlike traditional Large Language Models (LLMs), these models\nenhance logical deduction and decision-making capabilities during reasoning by\nincorporating mechanisms such as long chain-of-thought and self-reflection\nthrough reinforcement learning. However, with the widespread application of\nthese models, the problem of overthinking has gradually emerged. Specifically,\nwhen generating answers, these models often construct excessively long\nreasoning chains with redundant or repetitive steps, which leads to reduced\nreasoning efficiency and may affect the accuracy of the final answer.

Although existing sparse attention\nmechanisms have improved efficiency, they may still encounter issues such as\nstatic patterns or information loss. We introduce a trainable dynamic mask\nsparse attention mechanism, Dynamic Mask Attention, which effectively utilizes\ncontent-aware and position-aware sparsity. DMA achieves this through two key\ninnovations: First, it dynamically generates content-aware sparse masks from\nvalue representations, enabling the model to identify and focus on critical\ninformation adaptively. Second, it implements position-aware sparse attention\ncomputation that effectively skips unnecessary calculation regions. This\ndual-sparsity design allows the model to significantly reduce the computational\ncomplexity of important information while retaining complete information,\nachieving an excellent balance between information fidelity and computational\nefficiency. We have verified the performance of DMA through comprehensive\nexperiments.

Prior works primarily address this issue by reducing response\nlength, without fully examining the underlying semantic structure of the\nreasoning process. In this paper, we revisit overthinking by decomposing it\ninto two distinct forms: internal redundancy, which consists of\nlow-contribution reasoning steps within the first correct solution (FCS), and\nexternal redundancy, which refers to unnecessary continuation after the FCS. To\nmitigate both forms, we propose a dual-penalty reinforcement learning\nframework. For internal redundancy, we adopt a sliding-window semantic analysis\nto penalize low-gain reasoning steps that contribute little toward reaching the\ncorrect answer. For external redundancy, we penalize its proportion beyond the\nFCS to encourage earlier termination. Our method significantly compresses\nreasoning traces with minimal accuracy loss, and generalizes effectively to\nout-of-domain tasks such as question answering and code generation.

Compared to traditional\nreinforcement learning (RL) and recent LLM-based methods, Traffic-R1 offers\nthree significant advantages.

For example, when analyzing a hospital\npatient's blood pressure, we may add a sudden early drop and observe how it\nimpacts their future while preserving other conditions. Existing\ndiffusion-based editors rely on rigid, predefined attribute vectors as\nconditions and produce all-or-nothing edits through sampling. This attribute-\nand sampling-based approach limits flexibility in condition format and lacks\ncustomizable control over editing strength. To overcome these limitations, we\nintroduce Instruction-based Time Series Editing, where users specify intended\nedits using natural language. This allows users to express a wider range of\nedits in a more accessible format. We then introduce InstructTime, the first\ninstruction-based time series editor. InstructTime takes in time series and\ninstructions, embeds them into a shared multi-modal representation space, then\ndecodes their embeddings to generate edited time series.

A key advantage of\nthe reward-directed approach is its suitability for scenarios in which\nperformance metrics rely on costly engineering simulations or surrogate models\n(e.g. graph-based, ensemble models, or tree-based) are non-differentiable or\nprohibitively expensive to differentiate.

By incorporating\nsoft-value guidance during both the training and inference phases, the proposed\napproach reduces computational and memory costs to achieve high-reward designs,\neven beyond the training data. Empirical results indicate that this iterative\nreward-directed method substantially improves the ability of the diffusion\nmodels to generate samples with reduced resistance in 3D ship hull design and\nenhanced hydrodynamic performance in 2D airfoil design tasks. The proposed\nframework generates samples that extend beyond the training data distribution,\nresulting in a greater 25 percent reduction in resistance for ship design and\nover 10 percent improvement in the lift-to-drag ratio for the 2D airfoil\ndesign.

Finally, we rigorously prove that the\nslowest possible rate of decay for the derivative of the stability function is\n$O(|z|^{-1})$, revealing a fundamental limitation: all A-stable time-stepping\nmethods inevitably suppress parameter gradients in stiff regimes, posing a\nsignificant barrier for training and parameter identification in stiff neural\nODEs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd\uc5d0\uc11c \uacbd\ub7c9 \ud655\ub960 \ubc29\uc815\uc2dd\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \ubbf8\ubd84 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8f8. \uc548\uc815\uc131 \ud568\uc218\uc758 \ud2b9\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uacbd\uc9c1\uc131 \ubaa8\ub4dc\uc5d0\uc11c \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130\uc758 \ubbfc\uac10\ub3c4\uac00 \uc0ac\ub77c\uc9c0\ub294 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d.", "motivation": "\uc2e0\uacbd \ubbf8\ubd84 \ubc29\uc815\uc2dd \ubc0f \uae30\ud0c0 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ud654\ub41c \ub3d9\uc801 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \uae30\ubc18 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc758 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud558\uc5ec.", "method": "\uacbd\uc9c1\uc131 \ud1b5\ud569 \uc2a4\ud0b4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc548\uc815\uc131 \ud568\uc218 \ubd84\uc11d \ubc0f \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ud1b5\ud569 \uc2a4\ud0b4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubbfc\uac10\ub3c4 \uacc4\uc0b0.", "result": "\ubaa8\ub4e0 A-\uc548\uc815 \ubc0f L-\uc548\uc815 \uacbd\uc9c1 \uc218\uce58 \uc801\ubd84\ubc95\uc5d0\uc11c \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \ubbfc\uac10\ub3c4\uac00 \ud06c\uac8c \uac10\uc18c\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90c.", "conclusion": "\ubaa8\ub4e0 A-\uc548\uc815 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uacbd\uc9c1\uc131\uc774 \uac15\ud55c \uc601\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30\ub97c \uc5b5\uc81c\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e0\uacbd ODE\uc758 \ud6c8\ub828\uacfc \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \uc2dd\ubcc4\uc5d0 \uc911\ub300\ud55c \uc7a5\ubcbd\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c4."}}

Nevertheless,\ndiffusion policies suffer from diffusion representation collapse: semantically\nsimilar observations are mapped to indistinguishable features, ultimately\nimpairing their ability to handle subtle but critical variations required for\ncomplex robotic manipulation. To address this problem, we propose D2PPO\n(Diffusion Policy Policy Optimization with Dispersive Loss). D2PPO introduces\ndispersive loss regularization that combats representation collapse by treating\nall hidden representations within each batch as negative pairs. D2PPO compels\nthe network to learn discriminative representations of similar observations,\nthereby enabling the policy to identify subtle yet crucial differences\nnecessary for precise manipulation. In evaluation, we find that early-layer\nregularization benefits simple tasks, while late-layer regularization sharply\nenhances performance on complex manipulation tasks. On RoboMimic benchmarks,\nD2PPO achieves an average improvement of 22.7% in pre-training and 26.1% after\nfine-tuning, setting new SOTA results. In comparison with SOTA, results of\nreal-world experiments on a Franka Emika Panda robot show the excitingly high\nsuccess rate of our method.

In prior work, a heuristic weighting function has been used\nfor the denoising score matching loss without formal justification. In this\nwork, we demonstrate that heteroskedasticity is an inherent property of the\ndenoising score matching objective. This insight leads to a principled\nderivation of optimal weighting functions for generalized, arbitrary-order\ndenoising score matching losses, without requiring assumptions about the noise\ndistribution.

Recent advances move beyond\ndiscrete-time architectures like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) toward\ncontinuous-time formulations such as the family of Neural Ordinary Differential\nEquations (Neural ODEs). Generally, they have shown that capturing the\nunderlying dynamics is beneficial for generic tasks like interpolation,\nextrapolation, and classification. However, existing methods approximate the\ndynamics using unconstrained neural networks, which struggle to adapt reliably\nunder distributional shifts. In this paper, we recast time-series problems as\nthe continuous ODE-based optimal control problem. Rather than learning dynamics\nsolely from data, we optimize control actions that steer ODE trajectories\ntoward task objectives, bringing control-theoretical performance guarantees. To\nachieve this goal, we need to (1) design the appropriate control actions and\n(2) apply effective optimal control algorithms. As the actions should contain\nrich context information, we propose to employ the discrete-time model to\nprocess past sequences and generate actions, leading to a coordinate model to\nextract long-term temporal features to modulate short-term continuous dynamics.\nDuring training, we apply model predictive control to plan multi-step future\ntrajectories, minimize a task-specific cost, and greedily select the optimal\ncurrent action. We show that, under mild assumptions, this multi-horizon\noptimization leads to exponential convergence to infinite-horizon solutions,\nindicating that the coordinate model can gain robust and generalizable\nperformance.

The task involves selecting substation\nbreaker configurations that maximize cross-region power exports, a problem\ntypically formulated as a mixed-integer program (MIP) that is NP-hard and\ncomputationally intractable for large networks. OptiGridML replaces repeated\nMIP solves with a two-stage neural architecture: a line-graph neural network\n(LGNN) that approximates DC power flows for a given network topology, and a\nheterogeneous GNN (HeteroGNN) that predicts breaker states under structural and\nphysical constraints.

The implications of CRINN's success reach well beyond\nANNS optimization: It validates that LLMs augmented with reinforcement learning\ncan function as an effective tool for automating sophisticated algorithmic\noptimizations that demand specialized knowledge and labor-intensive manual\nrefinement.Code can be found at https://github.com/deepreinforce-ai/CRINN", "AI": {"tldr": "CRINN\uc740 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 ANNS \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "ANNS \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 RAG \ubc0f \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 LLM \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "CRINN\uc740 ANNS \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uac04\uc8fc\ud558\uace0, \uc2e4\ud589 \uc18d\ub3c4\ub97c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc2e0\ud638\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "CRINN\uc740 6\uac1c\uc758 NNS \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud588\uace0, 3\uac1c\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc0c1\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "CRINN\uc758 \uc131\uacf5\uc740 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\uac15\ub41c LLM\uc774 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uad6c\uac00 \ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

When approaching a work zone, large\ntrucks often need to merge into an adjacent lane because of lane closures\ncaused by construction activities. This study aims to enhance the safety of\nlarge truck merging maneuvers in work zones by evaluating the risk associated\nwith merging conflicts and establishing a decision-making strategy for merging\nbased on this risk assessment. To predict the risk of large trucks merging into\na mixed traffic stream within a work zone, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)\nneural network is employed. For a large truck intending to merge, it is\ncritical that the immediate downstream vehicle in the target lane maintains a\nminimum safe gap to facilitate a safe merging process. Once a conflict-free\nmerging opportunity is predicted, large trucks are instructed to merge in\nresponse to the lane closure. Our LSTM-based conflict prediction method is\ncompared against baseline approaches, which include probabilistic risk-based\nmerging, 50th percentile gap-based merging, and 85th percentile gap-based\nmerging strategies. The results demonstrate that our method yields a lower\nconflict risk, as indicated by reduced Time Exposed Time-to-Collision (TET) and\nTime Integrated Time-to-Collision (TIT) values relative to the baseline models.\nFurthermore, the findings indicate that large trucks that use our method can\nperform early merging while still in motion, as opposed to coming to a complete\nstop at the end of the current lane prior to closure, which is commonly\nobserved with the baseline approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\ud615 \ud2b8\ub7ed\uc758 \uc791\uc5c5 \uad6c\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \ubcd1\ud569\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\ub85c, LSTM \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud574 \ubcd1\ud569 \uad00\ub828 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \uacb0\uc815 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc218\ub9bd\ud568.", "motivation": "\uc791\uc5c5 \uad6c\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uad50\ud1b5 \uc0ac\uace0\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \ud2b8\ub7ed\uc774 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc6d0\uc778\uc774\uba70, \uc774\ub4e4\uc758 \ub300\ud615 \ud06c\uae30\uc640 \uc2dc\uc57c\uc758 \uc81c\ud55c\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud568.", "method": "LSTM \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc791\uc5c5 \uad6c\uc5ed \ub0b4 \ub300\ud615 \ud2b8\ub7ed\uc758 \ubcd1\ud569 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\uace0, \uc548\uc804\ud55c \ubcd1\ud569 \uae30\ud68c\ub97c \ucc3e\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc704\ud5d8 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud568.", "result": "LSTM \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc2dc\uac04 \ub178\ucd9c \ucda9\ub3cc \uc2dc\uac04(TET) \ubc0f \ud1b5\ud569 \uc2dc\uac04 \ucda9\ub3cc \uc2dc\uac04(TIT) \uac12\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc900 \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub0ae\uc740 \ucda9\ub3cc \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uba74 \ub300\ud615 \ud2b8\ub7ed\uc774 \ubcd1\ud569 \uc911\uc5d0 \uc815\uc9c0\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0\ub3c4 \uc870\uae30 \ubcd1\ud569\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc5b4, \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \uc548\uc804\ud568."}}

While\nprior work has primarily focused on weight sparsity, it often suffers from\nsignificant accuracy degradation. Activation sparsity, though promising, is\ntypically training-dependent and faces challenges in generalization. To address\nthese limitations, we introduce Amber Pruner, a training-free N:M activation\nsparsity method designed specifically for the prefill stage, targeting the\nacceleration of linear projection layers in LLMs. Extensive experiments across\nmultiple models and sparsity ratios (2:4, 4:8, and 8:16) demonstrate that Amber\nPruner can effectively sparsify and accelerate more than 55% of linear\ncomputations without requiring model retraining. To further enhance generality\nand efficiency, we propose Outstanding-sparse, a unified framework that\nintegrates Amber Pruner with post-training W8A8 quantization. Our approach\npreserves strong performance across a range of downstream tasks, with notable\nadvantages in generative tasks.

We present a novel defence method against\ntargeted data poisoning, which is one of the types of Sybil attacks, called\nLinear Algebra-based Detection (FedLAD). Unlike existing approaches, such as\nclustering and robust training, which struggle in situations where malicious\nnodes dominate, FedLAD models the federated learning aggregation process as a\nlinear problem, transforming it into a linear algebra optimisation challenge.\nThis method identifies potential attacks by extracting the independent linear\ncombinations from the original linear combinations, effectively filtering out\nredundant and malicious elements. Extensive experimental evaluations\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of FedLAD compared to five well-established\ndefence methods: Sherpa, CONTRA, Median, Trimmed Mean, and Krum. Using tasks\nfrom both image classification and natural language processing, our experiments\nconfirm that FedLAD is robust and not dependent on specific application\nsettings. The results indicate that FedLAD effectively protects federated\nlearning systems across a broad spectrum of malicious node ratios. Compared to\nbaseline defence methods, FedLAD maintains a low attack success rate for\nmalicious nodes when their ratio ranges from 0.2 to 0.8.

In each global round, the\naccess point partitions the clients into N+1 clusters, trains each cluster\nindependently via vanilla SL, and evaluates their validation losses on a shared\ndataset. Only the cluster with the lowest loss advances, thereby isolating and\ndiscarding malicious updates. We further enhance training and communication\nefficiency with Pigeon-SL+, which repeats training on the selected cluster to\nmatch the update throughput of standard SL. We validate the robustness and\neffectiveness of our approach under three representative attack models -- label\nflipping, activation and gradient manipulation -- demonstrating significant\nimprovements in accuracy and resilience over baseline SL methods in future\nintelligent wireless networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Pigeon-SL\uc740 \uc545\uc758\uc801\uc778 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uace0\uc548\ub41c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubd84\uc0b0 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130 \uae30\ubc18 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc545\uc758\uc801\uc778 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \uaca9\ub9ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubd84\ud560 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc21c\ucc28\uc801 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8 \uacfc\uc815\uc774 \uc545\uc758\uc801\uc778 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\uc758 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \uc800\ud558\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\ub97c N+1 \uac1c\uc758 \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130\ub85c \ub098\ub204\uace0, \uac01 \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130\ub97c \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ud55c \ud6c4, \uac00\uc7a5 \ub0ae\uc740 \uc190\uc2e4\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130\ub9cc\uc744 \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\uc5ec \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \uc9c4\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "Pigeon-SL\uc740 \ub808\uc774\ube14 \ud50c\ub9ac\ud551, \ud65c\uc131\ud654 \ubc0f \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uc870\uc791\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uacf5\uaca9 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\uc874\uc758 SL \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc720\uc758\ubbf8\ud55c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4 \ubc0f \ud68c\ubcf5\ub825\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc804\ubb38 \uc9c0\ub2a5\ud615 \ubb34\uc120 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c Pigeon-SL\uc740 \ubd84\uc0b0 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548\uc131\uacfc \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4."}}

This paper proposes the\nFlexible Automatic Identification and Removal (FAIR)-Pruner, a novel method for\nneural network structured pruning. Specifically, FAIR-Pruner first evaluates\nthe importance of each unit (e.g., neuron or channel) through the Utilization\nScore quantified by the Wasserstein distance. To reflect the performance\ndegradation after unit removal, it then introduces the Reconstruction Error,\nwhich is computed via the Taylor expansion of the loss function. Finally,\nFAIR-Pruner identifies superfluous units with negligible impact on model\nperformance by controlling the proposed Tolerance of Difference, which measures\ndifferences between unimportant units and those that cause performance\ndegradation.

While individual improvements\nto kernel functions (e.g., tree-based kernels, deep kernel learning) and\nacquisition functions (e.g., multi-step lookahead, tree-based planning) have\nbeen explored, the joint and autonomous selection of the best pair of these\nfundamental hyperparameters has been overlooked.

Recent advances in weight-activation quantization have primarily\nfocused on mapping both weights and activations to the INT4 format. Although\nthe new FP4 Tensor Cores in NVIDIA's Blackwell architecture offer up to 4x\nspeedup over FP16, existing INT4-based kernels fail to fully exploit this\ncapability due to mismatched data formats. To bridge this gap, we propose\nMicroMix, a co-designed mixed-precision quantization algorithm and matrix\nmultiplication kernel based on Microscaling (MX) data formats. Tailored for the\nBlackwell architecture, the MicroMix kernel supports arbitrary combinations of\nMXFP4, MXFP6, and MXFP8 channels, and produces BFloat16 outputs. To achieve a\nfavorable trade-off between accuracy and efficiency for each linear layer, we\nintroduce quantization thresholds that identify activation elements where\nlower-precision formats (MXFP4 or MXFP6) incur excessive quantization error.\nOur algorithm selectively allocates higher-precision channels to preserve\naccuracy while maintaining compute efficiency. MicroMix achieves competitive or\nsuperior performance across diverse downstream tasks, including zero-shot and\nfew-shot learning, language modeling, code generation, and mathematical\nreasoning. On both consumer-grade (RTX 5070Ti laptop) and server-grade (RTX\n5090) GPUs, our kernel delivers at least 20% faster execution than\nTensorRT-FP8. Furthermore, when applied to various Llama and Qwen models,\nMicroMix consistently improves prefill latency and memory efficiency across a\nrange of batch sizes compared to TensorRT baselines.

However, existing\nnon-uniform methods rely heavily on manually designed pruning policies (e.g.,\nlayer importance and scaling factors), and therefore cannot efficiently adapt\nto scenarios with dynamic pruning ratio requirements. Additionly, a critical\nbottleneck -- the time-consuming evaluation of pruning policies -- further\nlimits the feasibility of iteratively and dynamically finding optimal pruning\npolicies. To address these limitations, we propose PPF (Predictive Pruning\nFramework), a novel pruning framework for LLMs that eliminates manual design\ndependencies via second-level performance prediction. PPF not only supports\nreal-time pruning decisions under dynamic pruning ratios but is also applicable\nto static pruning scenarios. It employs an agent for producing adaptive and\nreal-time pruning actions, while a lightweight performance predictor that can\nevaluate a pruning policy in seconds, significantly speeding up the iterative\noptimization process. Experiments on Llama2-7B and Llama3-8B show that PPF can\ngenerate dynamic/static pruning policies and it reduces perplexity by up to\n33.4% (dynamic pruning) and 84.78% (static pruning) over existing methods,\noutperforming manually designed pruning policies. The performance predictor\nachieves second-level performance prediction with high accuracy (prediction\nerror < 0.0011). It reduces the mean evaluation latency from minute-level (1\nminute and 38.02 seconds of test-set evaluation methods) to second-level (1.52\nsecond), achieving over 64 times speedup.

To mitigate label noise, prior studies have proposed various robust\nloss functions to achieve noise tolerance in the presence of label noise,\nparticularly symmetric losses. However, they usually suffer from the\nunderfitting issue due to the overly strict symmetric condition. In this work,\nwe propose a simple yet effective approach for relaxing the symmetric\ncondition, namely $\\epsilon$-softmax, which simply modifies the outputs of the\nsoftmax layer to approximate one-hot vectors with a controllable error\n$\\epsilon$. Essentially, $\\epsilon$-softmax not only acts as an alternative for\nthe softmax layer, but also implicitly plays the crucial role in modifying the\nloss function. We prove theoretically that $\\epsilon$-softmax can achieve\nnoise-tolerant learning with controllable excess risk bound for almost any loss\nfunction. Recognizing that $\\epsilon$-softmax-enhanced losses may slightly\nreduce fitting ability on clean datasets, we further incorporate them with one\nsymmetric loss, thereby achieving a better trade-off between robustness and\neffective learning.

This principle necessitates robust mechanisms for two\ndistinct types of data removal: the selective erasure of specific entities and\ntheir associated knowledge from local subgraphs and the wholesale removal of a\nuser's entire dataset and influence. Existing methods often struggle to fully\naddress both unlearning requirements, frequently resulting in incomplete data\nremoval or the persistence of residual knowledge within the system.

In the case of complete client\nunlearning, the framework utilizes adversarial graph generation exclusively to\npurge the departed client's contributions from the remaining network.

To\naddress this issue, split federated learning (SFL) offers an approach by\noffloading partial model layers from near-RT-RIC to high-performance\nnon-RT-RIC. Nonetheless, its deployment presents two challenges: (i) Frequent\ndata/gradient transfers between near-RT-RIC and non-RT-RIC in SFL incur\nsignificant communication cost in O-RAN.

Existing geometric GNNs, which\nembed graphs into single fixed-curvature manifolds or discrete product spaces,\nstruggle to capture this diversity. We introduce Adaptive Riemannian Graph\nNeural Networks (ARGNN), a novel framework that learns a continuous and\nanisotropic Riemannian metric tensor field over the graph. It allows each node\nto determine its optimal local geometry, enabling the model to fluidly adapt to\nthe graph's structural landscape. Our core innovation is an efficient\nparameterization of the node-wise metric tensor, specializing to a learnable\ndiagonal form that captures directional geometric information while maintaining\ncomputational tractability. To ensure geometric regularity and stable training,\nwe integrate a Ricci flow-inspired regularization that smooths the learned\nmanifold.

In this work, we propose DeepKoopFormer, a principled forecasting\nframework that combines the representational power of Transformers with the\ntheoretical rigor of Koopman operator theory. Our model features a modular\nencoder-propagator-decoder structure, where temporal dynamics are learned via a\nspectrally constrained, linear Koopman operator in a latent space.

Comprehensive evaluations are conducted on both synthetic\ndynamical systems, real-world climate dataset (wind speed and surface\npressure), financial time series (cryptocurrency), and electricity generation\ndataset using the Python package that is prepared for this purpose. Across all\nexperiments, DeepKoopFormer consistently outperforms standard LSTM and baseline\nTransformer models in terms of accuracy, robustness to noise, and long-term\nforecasting stability.

Recent studies\nhave investigated the use of low-rank parameterization as a means of reducing\nmodel size and training cost. In this context, sparsity is often employed as a\ncomplementary technique to recover important information lost in low-rank\ncompression by capturing salient features in the residual space. However,\nexisting approaches typically combine low-rank and sparse components in a\nsimplistic or ad hoc manner, often resulting in undesirable performance\ndegradation compared to full-rank training.
