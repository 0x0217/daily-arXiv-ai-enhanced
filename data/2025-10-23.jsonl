In this paper,\nwe introduce RiskTagger, a large-language-model-based agent for the automatic\nannotation of crypto laundering behaviors in Web3. RiskTagger is designed to\nreplace or complement human annotators by addressing three key challenges:\nextracting clues from complex unstructured reports, reasoning over multichain\ntransaction paths, and producing auditor-friendly explanations. RiskTagger\nimplements an end-to-end multi-module agent, integrating a key-clue extractor,\na multichain fetcher with a laundering-behavior reasoner, and a data explainer,\nforming a data annotation pipeline. Experiments on the real case Bybit Hack\n(with the highest stolen asset value) demonstrate that RiskTagger achieves 100%\naccuracy in clue extraction, 84.1% consistency with expert judgment, and 90%\ncoverage in explanation generation.

Although\nhigh-performing verifiers can detect reasoning errors, making them reliable\nrequires substantial training. To address these challenges, we introduce a\nnovel inference-time framework, Adaptive Coopetition (AdCo), in which LLM\nagents utilize an adaptive, UCB-based \"coopetition\" mechanism.

To enhance complex reasoning, multi-agent\nsystems have been proposed to harness the collective intelligence of LLM\nagents.

Recent approaches model multi-agent systems\nas graph networks but optimize purely for agent performance, neglecting the\nquality of interactions.

While\nsingle-turn attacks have been extensively explored, adaptability, efficiency\nand effectiveness continue to remain key challenges for their multi-turn\ncounterparts. To address these gaps, we present PLAGUE, a novel plug-and-play\nframework for designing multi-turn attacks inspired by lifelong-learning\nagents. PLAGUE dissects the lifetime of a multi-turn attack into three\ncarefully designed phases (Primer, Planner and Finisher) that enable a\nsystematic and information-rich exploration of the multi-turn attack family.\nEvaluations show that red-teaming agents designed using PLAGUE achieve\nstate-of-the-art jailbreaking results, improving attack success rates (ASR) by\nmore than 30% across leading models in a lesser or comparable query budget.\nParticularly, PLAGUE enables an ASR (based on StrongReject) of 81.4% on\nOpenAI's o3 and 67.3% on Claude's Opus 4.1, two models that are considered\nhighly resistant to jailbreaks in safety literature. Our work offers tools and\ninsights to understand the importance of plan initialization, context\noptimization and lifelong learning in crafting multi-turn attacks for a\ncomprehensive model vulnerability evaluation."}

Sparse autoencoders\n(SAEs) make hidden activations more interpretable by exposing latent features\nthat often align with human concepts. Yet, these features are fragile and\npassive, offering no mechanism for systematic reasoning or model control. To\naddress this, we introduce ActivationReasoning (AR), a framework that embeds\nexplicit logical reasoning into the latent space of LLMs. It proceeds in three\nstages: (1) Finding latent representations, first latent concept\nrepresentations are identified (e.g., via SAEs) and organized into a\ndictionary; (2) Activating propositions, at inference time AR detects\nactivating concepts and maps them to logical propositions; and (3)Logical\nreasoning, applying logical rules over these propositions to infer higher-order\nstructures, compose new concepts, and steer model behavior. We evaluate AR on\nmulti-hop reasoning (PrOntoQA), abstraction and robustness to indirect concept\ncues (Rail2Country), reasoning over natural and diverse language (ProverQA),\nand context-sensitive safety (BeaverTails). Across all tasks, AR scales\nrobustly with reasoning complexity, generalizes to abstract and\ncontext-sensitive tasks, and transfers across model backbones. These results\ndemonstrate that grounding logical structure in latent activations not only\nimproves transparency but also enables structured reasoning, reliable control,\nand alignment with desired behaviors, providing a path toward more reliable and\nauditable AI."}

In our setting, agents\nare unsupervised and have no explicit rewards or learning objectives but\ninstead evolve over time according to reproduction, mutation, and natural\nselection. As they act, agents also shape their environment and the population\naround them in an ongoing dynamic ecology. Our goal is not to optimize a single\nhigh-performance policy, but instead to examine how behaviors emerge and evolve\nacross large populations due to natural competition and environmental\npressures. In an effort to discover how complex behaviors naturally emerge, we\nconduct experiments in large-scale worlds that reach populations of more than\n60,000 individual agents, each with their own evolved neural network policy. We\nidentify various emergent behaviors such as long-range resource extraction,\nvision-based foraging, and predation that arise under competitive and survival\npressures. We examine how sensing modalities and environmental scale affect the\nemergence of these behaviors, finding that some appear only in sufficiently\nlarge environments and populations, with larger scales increasing behavioral\nstability and consistency.

However,\ntask imbalance remains a major challenge in MTL. Although balancing the\nconvergence speeds of different tasks is an effective approach to address this\nissue, it is highly challenging to accurately characterize the training\ndynamics and convergence speeds of multiple tasks within the complex MTL\nsystem. To this end, we attempt to analyze the training dynamics in MTL by\nleveraging Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory and propose a new MTL method,\nNTKMTL. Specifically, we introduce an extended NTK matrix for MTL and adopt\nspectral analysis to balance the convergence speeds of multiple tasks, thereby\nmitigating task imbalance. Based on the approximation via shared\nrepresentation, we further propose NTKMTL-SR, achieving training efficiency\nwhile maintaining competitive performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat our methods achieve state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of\nbenchmarks, including both multi-task supervised learning and multi-task\nreinforcement learning.

We\nevaluated three deep learning models: a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), a Tabular\nResNet, and a Feature Tokenizer Transformer, on structured datasets from\nfinance, healthcare, and socioeconomics.

While conceptual modeling languages like i* provide rich qualitative\nrepresentations of strategic dependencies, they lack mechanisms for\nquantitative analysis of dynamic trade-offs. Conversely, classical game theory\noffers mathematical rigor but strips away contextual richness. This technical\nreport bridges this gap by developing computational foundations that formalize\ntwo critical dimensions of coopetition: interdependence and complementarity. We\nground interdependence in i* structural dependency analysis, translating\ndepender-dependee-dependum relationships into quantitative interdependence\ncoefficients through a structured translation framework. We formalize\ncomplementarity following Brandenburger and Nalebuff's Added Value concept,\nmodeling synergistic value creation with validated parameterization. We\nintegrate structural dependencies with bargaining power in value appropriation\nand introduce a game-theoretic formulation where Nash Equilibrium incorporates\nstructural interdependence. Validation combines comprehensive experimental\ntesting across power and logarithmic value function specifications,\ndemonstrating functional form robustness, with empirical application to the\nSamsung-Sony S-LCD joint venture (2004-2011), where logarithmic specifications\nachieve superior empirical fit (validation score 45/60) while power functions\nprovide theoretical tractability.
