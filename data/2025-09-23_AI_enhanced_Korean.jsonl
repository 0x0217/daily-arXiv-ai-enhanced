MICA\ncoordinates five role-specialized language agents, audited by a safety checker,\nto ensure accurate and compliant support. To achieve robust step understanding,\nwe introduce Adaptive Step Fusion (ASF), which dynamically blends expert\nreasoning with online adaptation from natural speech feedback. Furthermore, we\nestablish a new multi-agent coordination benchmark across representative task\ncategories and propose evaluation metrics tailored to industrial assistance,\nenabling systematic comparison of different coordination topologies. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that MICA consistently improves task success,\nreliability, and responsiveness over baseline structures, while remaining\ndeployable on practical offline hardware. Together, these contributions\nhighlight MICA as a step toward deployable, privacy-preserving multi-agent\nassistants for dynamic factory environments.

Without requiring additional nodes or extensive\nradio frequency chains, the FAS effectively enables adaptive antenna port\nselection by exploiting channel spatial correlation to enhance the key\ngeneration rate (KGR) at legitimate nodes. To comprehensively evaluate the\nefficiency of the FAS in PLKG, we propose an FAS-assisted PLKG model that\nintegrates transmit beamforming and sparse port selection under independent and\nidentically distributed and spatially correlated channel models, respectively.\nSpecifically, the PLKG utilizes reciprocal channel probing to derive a\nclosed-form KGR expression based on the mutual information between legitimate\nchannel estimates. Nonconvex optimization problems for these scenarios are\nformulated to maximize the KGR subject to transmit power constraints and sparse\nport activation. We propose an iterative algorithm by capitalizing on\nsuccessive convex approximation and Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to obtain a\nlocally optimal solution. A reweighted $\\ell_1$-norm-based algorithm is applied\nto advocate for the sparse port activation of FAS-assisted PLKG. Furthermore, a\nlow-complexity sliding window-based port selection is proposed to substitute\nreweighted $\\ell_1$-norm method based on Rayleigh-quotient analysis. Simulation\nresults demonstrate that the FAS-PLKG scheme significantly outperforms the\nFA-PLKG scheme in both independent and spatially correlated environments.

However, a problem with using\nReinforcement Learning in Traffic Signal Control is the reliability of the\ntrained RL agents due to the dynamically changing distribution of the input\ndata with respect to the distribution of the data used for training. This\npresents a major challenge and a reliability problem for the trained network of\nAI agents and could have very undesirable and even detrimental consequences if\na suitable solution is not found. Several researchers have tried to address\nthis problem using different approaches. In particular, Meta Reinforcement\nLearning (Meta RL) promises to be an effective solution. In this paper, we\nevaluate and analyze a state-of-the-art Meta RL approach called MetaLight and\nshow that, while under certain conditions MetaLight can indeed lead to\nreasonably good results, under some other conditions it might not perform well\n(with errors of up to 22%), suggesting that Meta RL schemes are often not\nrobust enough and can even pose major reliability problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uba54\ud0c0 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(Meta RL)\uc774 \uad50\ud1b5 \uc2e0\ud638 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c1\uba74\ud55c \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0 \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc774 \uad50\ud1b5 \uc2e0\ud638 \uc81c\uc5b4\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c RL \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud558\ub294 \ud544\uc694\uc131.", "method": "\ucd5c\uc2e0 \uba54\ud0c0 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc778 MetaLight\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0 \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "MetaLight\uac00 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc870\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc88b\uc740 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ub0bc \uc218 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub2e4\ub978 \uc870\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ucd5c\ub300 22%\uc758 \uc624\ub958\uc728\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc800\ud558\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uba54\ud0c0 RL \uccb4\uacc4\ub294 \uc885\uc885 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \uac15\ub825\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba70 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc77c\uc73c\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uad50\ud1b5 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5(ML)\uacfc \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5(AI)\uc758 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc774 \ucd5c\uadfc \uba87 \ub144 \ub3d9\uc548 \ud06c\uac8c \uc99d\uac00\ud588\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c ML \ubc0f AI \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd \uc911\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc740 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc800\uc790\ub4e4\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc785\uc99d\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uad50\ud1b5 \uc2e0\ud638 \uc81c\uc5b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \ub54c\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828\uc5d0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc785\ub825 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c RL \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc774\uc790 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \uc801\uc808\ud55c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc774 \ubc1c\uacac\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba74 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ubc14\ub78c\uc9c1\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc5f0\uad6c\uc790\ub4e4\uc774 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud588\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788, \uba54\ud0c0 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(Meta RL)\uc740 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc774 \ub420 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \uae30\ub300\ub41c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uba54\ud0c0\ub77c\uc774\ud2b8(MetaLight)\ub77c\ub294 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uba54\ud0c0 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uba70, \ud2b9\uc815 \uc870\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uba54\ud0c0\ub77c\uc774\ud2b8\uac00 \uc2e4\uc81c\ub85c \uad1c\ucc2e\uc740 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub2e4\ub978 \uc870\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc88b\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4(\ucd5c\ub300 22%\uc758 \uc624\ub958). \uc774\ub294 \uba54\ud0c0 RL \uccb4\uacc4\uac00 \uc885\uc885 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \uac15\ub825\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba70 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc77c\uc73c\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

This tight\nintegration, however, also introduces a new and critical attack surface.\nAttackers can exploit these components by injecting malicious instructions into\nuntrusted external sources, effectively hijacking the Agent to perform harmful\noperations beyond the user's intention or awareness. This emerging threat has\nquickly attracted research attention, leading to various proposed attack\nvectors, such as hijacking Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers to access\nprivate data. However, most existing approaches lack stealth and persistence,\nlimiting their practical impact.\n  We propose the Cuckoo Attack, a novel attack that achieves stealthy and\npersistent command execution by embedding malicious payloads into configuration\nfiles. These files, commonly used in AI-IDEs, execute system commands during\nroutine operations, without displaying execution details to the user. Once\nconfigured, such files are rarely revisited unless an obvious runtime error\noccurs, creating a blind spot for attackers to exploit. We formalize our attack\nparadigm into two stages, including initial infection and persistence. Based on\nthese stages, we analyze the practicality of the attack execution process and\nidentify the relevant exploitation techniques. Furthermore, we analyze the\nimpact of Cuckoo Attack, which can not only invade the developer's local\ncomputer but also achieve supply chain attacks through the spread of\nconfiguration files. We contribute seven actionable checkpoints for vendors to\nevaluate their product security. The critical need for these checks is\ndemonstrated by our end-to-end Proof of Concept, which validated the proposed\nattack across nine mainstream Agent and AI-IDE pairs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Cuckoo

Although several MAPF methods which\nsolve full-horizon MAPF have completeness guarantees, very few MAPF methods\nthat plan partial paths have completeness guarantees. Recent work introduced\nthe Windowed Complete MAPF (WinC-MAPF) framework, which shows how windowed\noptimal MAPF solvers (e.g., SS-CBS) can use heuristic updates and disjoint\nagent groups to maintain completeness even when planning partial paths\n(Veerapaneni et al. 2024). A core limitation of WinC-MAPF is that they required\noptimal MAPF solvers. Our main contribution is to extend WinC-MAPF by showing\nhow we can use a bounded suboptimal solver while maintaining completeness. In\nparticular, we design Dynamic Agent Grouping ECBS (DAG-ECBS) which dynamically\ncreates and plans agent groups while maintaining that each agent group solution\nis bounded suboptimal. We prove how DAG-ECBS can maintain completeness in the\nWinC-MAPF framework. DAG-ECBS shows improved scalability compared to SS-CBS and\ncan outperform windowed ECBS without completeness guarantees. More broadly, our\nwork serves as a blueprint for designing more MAPF methods that can use the\nWinC-MAPF framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc644\uc804\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc900\ucd5c\uc801 \ud574\ubc95\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uc5ec WinC-MAPF\ub97c \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\ub294\ub370 \uc911\uc810\uc744 \ub450\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uadf8\ub8f9\ud654\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uadf8\ub8f9 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "MAPF \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd80\ubd84 \uacbd\ub85c \uacc4\ud68d\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uc644\uc804\uc131 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "Dynamic Agent Grouping ECBS (DAG-ECBS)\ub97c \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uc5ec \uac01 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uadf8\ub8f9 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc900\ucd5c\uc801\uc784\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uadf8\ub8f9\uc744 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uacc4\ud68d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "DAG-ECBS\ub294 SS-CBS\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub41c \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, \uc644\uc804\uc131 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc774 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc708\ub3c4\uc6b0 ECBS\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 WinC-MAPF \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc740 MAPF \ubc29\ubc95 \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uccad\uc0ac\uc9c4 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uba40\ud2f0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uacbd\ub85c \ucc3e\uae30(MAPF)\ub294 \ud300\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ucda9\ub3cc \uc5c6\ub294 \uacbd\ub85c \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \ucc3e\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc804\uccb4 \uc218\ud3c9 MAPF\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec MAPF \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc774 \uc644\uc804\uc131 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubd80\ubd84 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uacc4\ud68d\ud558\ub294 MAPF \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ub4dc\ubb45\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc708\ub3c4\uc6b0 \ucd5c\uc801 MAPF \ud574\ubc95(\uc608: SS-CBS)\uc774 \ubd80\ubd84 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uacc4\ud68d\ud560 \ub54c\ub3c4 \uc644\uc804\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8 \ubc0f \ubd84\ub9ac\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uadf8\ub8f9\uc744 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\ub294 \uc708\ub3c4\uc6b0 \uc644\uc804 MAPF(WinC-MAPF) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4(Veerapaneni \uc678, 2024).

This work introduces a diagnostic framework for\nexpert systems that not only evaluates but also facilitates the transfer of\nexpert behaviour into LLM-powered agents. The framework integrates (i) curated\ngolden datasets of expert annotations, (ii) silver datasets generated through\ncontrolled behavioural mutation, and (iii) an LLM-based Agent Judge that scores\nand prescribes targeted improvements. These prescriptions are embedded into a\nvectorized recommendation map, allowing expert interventions to propagate as\nreusable improvement trajectories across multiple system instances. We\ndemonstrate the framework on a multi-agent recruiter-assistant system, showing\nthat it uncovers latent cognitive failures - such as biased phrasing,\nextraction drift, and tool misrouting - while simultaneously steering agents\ntoward expert-level reasoning and style.

This survey offers a comprehensive and systematic\nexamination of quantumsafe security for Cloud Computing (CC), focusing on the\nvulnerabilities, transition strategies, and mitigation mechanisms required to\nsecure cloud infrastructures in the quantum era. We evaluated the landscape of\nquantum threats across the entire CC stack, demonstrating how quantum\nalgorithms can undermine classical encryption and compromise cloud security at\nmultiple architectural layers. Using a structured risk assessment methodology\nbased on the STRIDE model, we evaluate quantum-induced attack vectors and their\nimpact on cloud environments. To address these challenges, we propose a layered\nsecurity framework that integrates hybrid cryptographic transition strategies,\ncryptographic agility, and proactive risk mitigation. We analyze the\npreparation and implementation approaches of the major Cloud Service Providers\n(CSPs), including AWS, Azure and GCP, synthesizing platform-specific\ninitiatives toward Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC). Furthermore, we provide a\ndetailed evaluation of standardized PQC algorithms, exploring their resilience\nto side-channel and active attacks within cloud-native deployments. This survey\nserves as a strategic reference for cloud architects, policymakers, and\nresearchers, offering actionable insights for navigating the complex transition\nto quantum-resilient cloud systems. We conclude by identifying six key future\nresearch directions: standardization and interoperability, performance and\nscalability, implementation security, integration with emerging technologies,\nsystemic preparedness, and crypto-agile migration frameworks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc591\uc790 \uc548\uc804 \ubcf4\uc548\uc774 \ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uba70, \uad00\ub828 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uacfc \uc804\ud658 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc591\uc790 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305\uc774 \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \ubcf4\uc548\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc704\ud611\uc744 \ub2e4\uac01\ub3c4\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0 \ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc \uc778\ud504\ub77c\ub97c \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud568.", "method": "\uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc704\ud5d8 \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860(STRIDE \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18)\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc591\uc790 \uacf5\uaca9 \ubca1\ud130\uc640 \ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc591\uc790 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc774 \uace0\uc804\uc801\uc778 \uc554\ud638\ud654 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc57d\ud654\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc \ubcf4\uc548\uc744 \uc800\ud574\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc554\ud638 \uc804\ud658 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \ub2e4\uce35 \ubcf4\uc548 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ud5a5\ud6c4 \uc5f0\uad6c \ubc29\ud5a5\uc73c\ub85c \ud45c\uc900\ud654\uc640 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc6b4\uc6a9\uc131, \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \ud655\uc7a5\uc131, \uad6c\ud604 \ubcf4\uc548, \uc2e0\uae30\uc220 \ud1b5\ud569, \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc801 \ub300\ube44, \uc554\ud638 \ubbfc\ucca9\ud55c \ub9c8\uc774\uadf8\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc591\uc790 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305(QC)\uc740 \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \uace0\uc804 \uc554\ud638 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc704\ud611\ud558\ub294 \ubcc0\ud601\uc801 \uc704\ud611\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc124\ubb38\uc870\uc0ac\ub294 \uc591\uc790 \uc548\uc804 \ubcf4\uc548\uc758 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \uac80\ud1a0\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305(CC)\uc758 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810, \uc804\ud658 \uc804\ub7b5, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uc591\uc790 \uc2dc\ub300\uc758 \ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc \uc778\ud504\ub77c\ub97c \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc644\ud654 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucda5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 CC \uc2a4\ud0dd \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc591\uc790 \uc704\ud611\uc758 \uacbd\uacfc\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0, \uc591\uc790 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc774 \uace0\uc804\uc801\uc778 \uc554\ud638\ud654 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc57d\ud654\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc \ubcf4\uc548\uc744 \uc800\ud574\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Because a scheming AI would deliberately try to hide its\nmisaligned goals and actions, measuring and mitigating scheming requires\ndifferent strategies than are typically used in ML. We propose that assessing\nanti-scheming interventions requires at least (1) testing propensity to scheme\non far out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks, (2) evaluating whether lack of scheming\nis driven by situational awareness, and (3) checking for robustness to\npre-existing misaligned goals. We use a broad category of \"covert actions\" --\nsuch as secretly breaking rules or intentionally underperforming in tests -- as\na proxy for scheming, and design evaluations for covert actions. We then\nstress-test deliberative alignment as a case study for anti-scheming. Across 26\nOOD evaluations (180+ environments), deliberative alignment reduces covert\naction rates (OpenAI o3: 13%->0.4%) but does not fully eliminate them. Our\nmitigation is also able to largely stop agents from pursuing a hidden goal\npreviously trained into the model, but we still find misbehavior after\nadditional red-teaming. We find that models' chain-of-thought (CoT) often\ndemonstrates awareness of being evaluated for alignment, and show causal\nevidence that this awareness decreases covert behavior, while unawareness\nincreases it. Therefore, we cannot exclude that the observed reductions in\ncovert action rates are at least partially driven by situational awareness.\nWhile we rely on human-legible CoT for training, studying situational\nawareness, and demonstrating clear evidence of misalignment, our ability to\nrely on this degrades as models continue to depart from reasoning in standard\nEnglish. We encourage research into alignment mitigations for scheming and\ntheir assessment, especially for the adversarial case of deceptive alignment,\nwhich this paper does not address.", "AI": {"tldr":

However,\ntheir static deployment conflicts with growing societal and regulatory demands\n-- particularly the need to unlearn specific data upon request, as mandated by\nprivacy frameworks such as the GDPR. Traditional unlearning approaches,\nincluding retraining, activation editing, or distillation, are often\ncomputationally expensive, fragile, and ill-suited for real-time or\ncontinuously evolving systems. In this paper, we propose a paradigm shift:\nrethinking unlearning not as a retroactive intervention but as a built-in\ncapability. We introduce a prompt-based learning framework that unifies\nknowledge acquisition and removal within a single training phase. Rather than\nencoding information in model weights, our approach binds class-level semantics\nto dedicated prompt tokens. This design enables instant unlearning simply by\nremoving the corresponding prompt -- without retraining, model modification, or\naccess to original data. Experiments demonstrate that our framework preserves\npredictive performance on retained classes while effectively erasing forgotten\nones. Beyond utility, our method exhibits strong privacy and security\nguarantees: it is resistant to membership inference attacks, and prompt removal\nprevents any residual knowledge extraction, even under adversarial conditions.\nThis ensures compliance with data protection principles and safeguards against\nunauthorized access to forgotten information, making the framework suitable for\ndeployment in sensitive and regulated environments. Overall, by embedding\nremovability into the architecture itself, this work establishes a new\nfoundation for designing modular, scalable and ethically responsive AI models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8

Second, we employ a dual anomaly detection approach that integrates\nIsolation Forest unsupervised learning algorithms with status code validation\nto achieve comprehensive trace anomaly identification. Third, we design a\nstatistical symmetry ratio filtering mechanism coupled with a two-stage LLM\nanalysis strategy to enable full-stack phenomenon summarization across\nnode-service-pod hierarchies. The multimodal root cause analysis module\nleverages carefully designed cross-modal prompts to deeply integrate multimodal\nanomaly information, fully exploiting the cross-modal understanding and logical\nreasoning capabilities of large language models to generate structured analysis\nresults encompassing fault components, root cause descriptions, and reasoning\ntrace. Comprehensive ablation studies validate the complementary value of each\nmodal data and the effectiveness of the system architecture. The proposed\nsolution demonstrates superior performance in complex microservice fault\nscenarios, achieving a final score of 50.71.

Recently, there has been growing interest in integrating GenAI\ninto wireless sensing systems. By leveraging generative techniques such as data\naugmentation, domain adaptation, and denoising, wireless sensing applications,\nincluding device localization, human activity recognition, and environmental\nmonitoring, can be significantly improved. This survey investigates the\nconvergence of GenAI and wireless sensing from two complementary perspectives.\nFirst, we explore how GenAI can be integrated into wireless sensing pipelines,\nfocusing on two modes of integration: as a plugin to augment task-specific\nmodels and as a solver to directly address sensing tasks. Second, we analyze\nthe characteristics of mainstream generative models, such as Generative\nAdversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and diffusion\nmodels, and discuss their applicability and unique advantages across various\nwireless sensing tasks. We further identify key challenges in applying GenAI to\nwireless sensing and outline a future direction toward a wireless foundation\nmodel: a unified, pre-trained design capable of scalable, adaptable, and\nefficient signal understanding across diverse sensing tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc0dd\uc131\uc801 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5(GenAI)\uacfc \ubb34\uc120 \uac10\uc9c0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud1b5\ud569\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc870\uc0ac.", "motivation": "GenAI\ub294 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud130 \ube44\uc804\uacfc \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \ucc98\ub9ac \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \ubb34\uc120 \uac10\uc9c0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc758 \ud1b5\ud569\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad00\uc2ec\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubb34\uc120 \uac10\uc9c0 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc5d0 GenAI\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubaa8\ub4dc\ub97c \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\uace0, Gan, VAE \ubc0f \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "GenAI\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uba74 \uc7a5\uce58 \uc704\uce58 \ucd94\uc801, \uc778\uac04 \ud65c\ub3d9 \uc778\uc2dd \ubc0f \ud658\uacbd \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\uc774 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "GenAI\uc758 \ubb34\uc120 \uac10\uc9c0 \uc801\uc6a9\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uac10\uc9c0 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\ud574\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569 \uc608\ube44 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc124\uacc4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc0dd\uc131\uc801 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5(GenAI)\uc740 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud130 \ube44\uc804(CV) \ubc0f \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \ucc98\ub9ac(NLP)\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4 \uace0\ucda9\uc2e4\ub3c4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud569\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc\uc5d0\ub294 \ubb34\uc120 \uac10\uc9c0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 GenAI\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad00\uc2ec\uc774 \ub192\uc544\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc99d\uac15, \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc801\uc751 \ubc0f \uc7a1\uc74c \uc81c\uac70\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc0dd\uc131 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc7a5\uce58 \uc704\uce58 \ucd94\uc801, \uc778\uac04 \ud65c\ub3d9 \uc778\uc2dd \ubc0f \ud658\uacbd \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ubb34\uc120 \uac10\uc9c0 \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc774 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc870\uc0ac\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc0c1\ubcf4\uc801 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c GenAI\uc640 \ubb34\uc120 \uac10\uc9c0\uc758 \uc735\ud569\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uccab\uc9f8, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 GenAI\ub97c \ubb34\uc120 \uac10\uc9c0 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\uba70, \uc791\uc5c5 \ud2b9\uc815 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ubcf4\uac15\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud50c\ub7ec\uadf8\uc778\uc73c\ub85c\uc11c\uc758 \ud1b5\ud569 \ubc0f \uac10\uc9c0 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc9c1\uc811 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc194\ubc84\ub85c\uc11c\uc758 \ud1b5\ud569\uc758 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubaa8\ub4dc\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucda5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub458\uc9f8, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc0dd\uc131\uc801 \uc801\ub300 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(GAN), \ubcc0\ub7c9 \uc790\ub3d9 \uc778\ucf54\ub354(VAE) \ubc0f \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc8fc\ub958 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubb34\uc120 \uac10\uc9c0 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uacfc \uace0\uc720\ud55c \uc7a5\uc810\uc744 \ub17c\uc758\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub610\ud55c \ubb34\uc120 \uac10\uc9c0\uc5d0 GenAI\ub97c \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc8fc\uc694 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uac10\uc9c0 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uc801\uc751 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uba70 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc2e0\ud638 \uc774\ud574\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569 \ubbf8\ub9ac \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc124\uacc4\uc778 \ubb34\uc120 \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubbf8\ub798 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

In neural and physical\nsystems, Kuramoto models capture synchronization phenomena across coupled\noscillators -- a behavior that we re-purpose here as an inductive bias for\nstructured image generation. In our framework, the forward process performs\n\\textit{synchronization} among phase variables through globally or locally\ncoupled oscillator interactions and attraction to a global reference phase,\ngradually collapsing the data into a low-entropy von Mises distribution. The\nreverse process then performs \\textit{desynchronization}, generating diverse\npatterns by reversing the dynamics with a learned score function. This approach\nenables structured destruction during forward diffusion and a hierarchical\ngeneration process that progressively refines global coherence into fine-scale\ndetails. We implement wrapped Gaussian transition kernels and periodicity-aware\nnetworks to account for the circular geometry. Our method achieves competitive\nresults on general image benchmarks and significantly improves generation\nquality on orientation-dense datasets like fingerprints and textures.\nUltimately, this work

This study presents a comparison between these two\nmethodologies, analyzing their respective strengths, limitations, and\napplication scenarios, and proposes a basic framework to evaluate their key\nproperties. Rule-based systems offer high interpretability, deterministic\nbehavior, and ease of implementation in stable environments, making them ideal\nfor regulated industries and safety-critical applications. However, they face\nchallenges with scalability, adaptability, and performance in complex or\nevolving contexts. Conversely, data-driven systems excel in detecting hidden\nanomalies, enabling predictive maintenance and dynamic adaptation to new\nconditions. Despite their high accuracy, these models face challenges related\nto data availability, explainability, and integration complexity. The paper\nsuggests hybrid solutions as a possible promising direction, combining the\ntransparency of rule-based logic with the analytical power of machine learning.\nOur hypothesis is that the future of industrial monitoring lies in intelligent,\nsynergic systems that leverage both expert knowledge and data-driven insights.\nThis dual approach enhances resilience, operational efficiency, and trust,\npaving the way for smarter and more flexible industrial environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc0b0\uc5c5 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uaddc\uce59 \uae30\ubc18 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc5d0\uc11c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc774 \uc804\ud658\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc758 \ube44\uad50\uc640 \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc758 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc0b0\uc5c5 4.0 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc9c4\ud654\uc640 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131.", "method": "\uaddc\uce59 \uae30\ubc18 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uacfc \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc7a5\ub2e8\uc810 \ubc0f \uc801\uc6a9 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624 \ubd84\uc11d.", "result": "\ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc774 \uc81c\uc548\ub418\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uaddc\uce59 \uae30\ubc18 \ub17c\ub9ac\uc640 \uba38\uc2e0 \ub7ec\ub2dd\uc758 \ubd84\uc11d \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ud5a5.", "conclusion": "\ubbf8\ub798\uc758 \uc0b0\uc5c5 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\uc740 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uacfc \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18 \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc801 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud560 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc0b0\uc5c5 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ud2b9\ud788 \uc0b0\uc5c5 4.0 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uaddc\uce59 \uae30\ubc18 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc5d0\uc11c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc774 \uc804\ud658\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \ube44\uad50\ud558\uba70, \uac01\uac01\uc758 \uac15\uc810, \ud55c\uacc4 \ubc0f \uc801\uc6a9 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0, \uc8fc\uc694 \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uae30\ubcf8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uaddc\uce59 \uae30\ubc18 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ub192\uc740 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131, \uacb0\uc815\ub860\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9 \ubc0f \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uad6c\ud604 \uc6a9\uc774\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ubbc0\ub85c \uaddc\uc81c \uc0b0\uc5c5 \ubc0f \uc548\uc804-critical \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc5d0 \uc801\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc9c4\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\ub9e5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud655\uc7a5\uc131, \uc801\uc751\uc131 \ubc0f \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ub41c \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubc18\ub300\ub85c, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc228\uaca8\uc9c4 \uc774\uc0c1\uc744 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \uc608\uce21 \uc720\uc9c0\ubcf4\uc218 \ubc0f \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc870\uac74\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub3d9\uc801 \uc801\uc751\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub192\uc740 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uac00\uc6a9\uc131, \uc124\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \ubc0f \ud1b5\ud569 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ub41c \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uaddc\uce59 \uae30\ubc18 \ub17c\ub9ac\uc758 \ud22c\uba85\uc131\uacfc \uba38\uc2e0 \ub7ec\ub2dd\uc758 \ubd84\uc11d \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \ubc29\ud5a5\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uac00\uc124\uc740 \uc0b0\uc5c5 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\uc758 \ubbf8\ub798\uac00 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uacfc \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18 \uc778\uc0ac\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc2dc\ub108\uc9c0\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \uc788\ub2e4\uace0 \uc0dd\uac01\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc774\uc911 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ud0c4\ub825\uc131, \uc6b4\uc601 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \ubc0f \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf1c \ub354 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8\ud558\uace0 \uc720\uc5f0\ud55c \uc0b0\uc5c5 \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \uc870\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Recently, leveraging\ncontrastive loss to construct more transferable and less forgetful\nrepresentations has been a promising direction in CL. Despite advancements,\ntheir performance is still limited due to confusion arising from both\ninter-task and intra-task features. To address the problem, we propose a simple\nyet effective contrastive strategy named \\textbf{G}lobal \\textbf{P}re-fixing,\n\\textbf{L}ocal \\textbf{A}djusting for \\textbf{S}upervised \\textbf{C}ontrastive\nlearning (GPLASC). Specifically, to avoid task-level confusion, we divide the\nentire unit hypersphere of representations into non-overlapping regions, with\nthe centers of the regions forming an inter-task pre-fixed \\textbf{E}quiangular\n\\textbf{T}ight \\textbf{F}rame (ETF).

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables integration\nbetween LLMs and external tools.\n  Objective: To evaluate whether an LLM connected to an EHR database via MCP\ncan autonomously retrieve clinically relevant information in a real hospital\nsetting.\n  Methods: We developed EHR-MCP, a framework of custom MCP tools integrated\nwith the hospital EHR database, and used GPT-4.1 through a LangGraph ReAct\nagent to interact with it. Six tasks were tested, derived from use cases of the\ninfection control team (ICT). Eight patients discussed at ICT conferences were\nretrospectively analyzed. Agreement with physician-generated gold standards was\nmeasured.\n  Results: The LLM consistently selected and executed the correct MCP tools.\nExcept for two tasks, all tasks achieved near-perfect accuracy. Performance was\nlower in the complex task requiring time-dependent calculations. Most errors\narose from incorrect arguments or misinterpretation of tool results. Responses\nfrom EHR-MCP were reliable, though long and repetitive data risked exceeding\nthe context window.\n  Conclusions: LLMs can retrieve clinical data from an EHR via MCP tools in a\nreal hospital setting, achieving near-perfect performance in simple tasks while\nhighlighting challenges in complex ones. EHR-MCP provides an infrastructure for\nsecure, consistent data access and may serve as a foundation for hospital AI\nagents.

Compressed sensing finds applications in\ncritical domains, from medical imaging to cryptography, where adversarial\nrobustness is crucial to prevent catastrophic failures. However, a solid\ntheoretical understanding of the performance of unfolding networks in the\npresence of adversarial attacks is still in its infancy. In this paper, we\nstudy the adversarial generalization of unfolding networks when perturbed with\n$l_2$-norm constrained attacks, generated by the fast gradient sign method.\nParticularly, we choose a family of state-of-the-art overaparameterized\nunfolding networks and deploy a new framework to estimate their adversarial\nRademacher complexity. Given this estimate, we provide adversarial\ngeneralization error bounds for the networks under study, which are tight with\nrespect to the attack level. To our knowledge, this is the first theoretical\nanalysis on the adversarial generalization of unfolding networks.

The\nobjective can be formulated as a structured bi-level optimization problem, in\nwhich the leader needs to learn a policy maximizing its reward, anticipating\nthe response of the followers. Existing methods for solving these (and related)\nproblems often rely on restrictive independence assumptions between the\nleader's and followers' objectives, use samples inefficiently due to\nnested-loop algorithm structure, and lack finite-time convergence guarantees.\nTo address these limitations, we propose AC-SMFG, a single-loop actor-critic\nalgorithm that operates on continuously generated Markovian samples. The\nalgorithm alternates between (semi-)gradient updates for the leader, a\nrepresentative follower, and the mean field, and is simple to implement in\npractice. We establish the finite-time and finite-sample convergence of the\nalgorithm to a stationary point of the Stackelberg objective. To our knowledge,\nthis is the first Stackelberg MFG algorithm with non-asymptotic convergence\nguarantees. Our key assumption is a \"gradient alignment\" condition, which\nrequires that the full policy gradient of the leader can be approximated by a\npartial component of it, relaxing the existing leader-follower independence\nassumption.

To mitigate the\nepistemic uncertainty associated with unknown parameters, we take a Bayesian\napproach to estimate the parameters from data and impose a coherent risk\nfunctional (with respect to the Bayesian posterior distribution) on the loss.\nSince this formulation usually does not satisfy the interchangeability\nprinciple, it does not admit Bellman equations and cannot be solved by\napproaches based on dynamic programming.

Currently, a common training problem set choice in existing MetaBBOs\nis well-known benchmark suites CoCo-BBOB. Although such choice facilitates the\nMetaBBO's development, problem instances in CoCo-BBOB are more or less limited\nin diversity, raising the risk of overfitting of MetaBBOs, which might further\nresults in poor generalization. In this paper, we propose an instance\ngeneration approach, termed as \\textbf{LSRE}, which could generate diverse\ntraining problem instances for MetaBBOs to learn more generalizable policies.\nLSRE first trains an autoencoder which maps high-dimensional problem features\ninto a 2-dimensional latent space. Uniform-grid sampling in this latent space\nleads to hidden representations of problem instances with sufficient diversity.\nBy leveraging a genetic-programming approach to search function formulas with\nminimal L2-distance to these hidden representations, LSRE reverse engineers a\ndiversified problem set, termed as \\textbf{Diverse-BBO}. We validate the\neffectiveness of LSRE by training various MetaBBOs on Diverse-BBO and observe\ntheir generalization performances on either synthetic or realistic scenarios.\nExtensive experimental results underscore the superiority of Diverse-BBO to\nexisting training set choices in MetaBBOs. Further ablation studies not only\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of design choices in LSRE, but also reveal\ninteresting insights on instance diversity and MetaBBO's generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 Meta-Black-Box Optimization (MetaBBO)\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uac15\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 LSRE \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \uc124\uacc4\uc5d0 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc9d1\uc911\uc801\uc778 \uc778\uac04 \uc804\ubb38\uc131\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \ucd5c\uadfc MetaBBO \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uba54\ud0c0 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uac15\uc810\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "LSRE\ub294 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \ubb38\uc81c \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 2\ucc28\uc6d0 \uc7a0\uc7ac \uacf5\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \ub9e4\ud551\ud558\ub294 \uc624\ud1a0\uc778\ucf54\ub354\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\uace0, \uc774 \uc7a0\uc7ac \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \uade0\uc77c \uadf8\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uc774 \ucda9\ubd84\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c MetaBBO\ub97c Diverse-BBO\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub4e4\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uad00\ucc30\ud558\uace0, \uae30\uc874\uc758 MetaBBO \ud6c8\ub828 \uc138\ud2b8 \uc120\ud0dd\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud568\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "LSRE \uc124\uacc4 \uc120\ud0dd\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc785\uc99d\ud558\ub294 \ucd94\uac00\uc801\uc778 \uc808\uc81c \uc5f0\uad6c\ub4e4\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uacfc MetaBBO\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud765\ubbf8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud1b5\ucc30\uc774 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0ac\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc9d1\uc911\uc801\uc778 \uc778\uac04 \uc804\ubb38 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc5c6\uc774 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \ucd5c\uadfc \uba54\ud0c0 \ube14\ub799 \ubc15\uc2a4 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654(MetaBBO) \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uba54\ud0c0 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uac15\ub3c4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \ubbf8\ub9ac \uc815\uc758\ub41c \ud6c8\ub828 \ubb38\uc81c \uc9d1\ud569\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \uae30\ubc18 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \uc124\uacc4 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc800\uc218\uc900 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc758 \uc801\uc751 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud604\uc7ac \uae30\uc874 MetaBBO\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubb38\uc81c \uc9d1\ud569 \uc120\ud0dd\uc740 \uc798 \uc54c\ub824\uc9c4 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ubaa8\uc74c\uc778 CoCo-BBOB\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc120\ud0dd\uc740 MetaBBO\uc758 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, CoCo-BBOB\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc5b4 MetaBBO\uc758 \uacfc\uc801\ud569 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc800\ud558\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc9c8 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 LSRE\ub77c\ub294 \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 MetaBBO\uac00 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud6c8\ub828 \ubb38\uc81c \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

In\nthis paper, we anticipate and, most importantly, evaluate two promising\nstrategies. First, we consider the use of foundation world models (FWMs) that\nexploit the prior knowledge of FMs to enable training and evaluating agents\nwith simulated interactions. Second, we consider the use of foundation agents\n(FAs) that exploit the reasoning capabilities of FMs for decision-making. We\nevaluate both approaches empirically in a family of grid-world environments\nthat are suitable for the current generation of large language models (LLMs).\nOur results suggest that improvements in LLMs already translate into better\nFWMs and FAs; that FAs based on current LLMs can already provide excellent\npolicies for sufficiently simple environments; and that the coupling of FWMs\nand reinforcement learning agents is highly promising for more complex settings\nwith partial observability and stochastic elements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2e4\uc81c \uc751\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c \ube44\uc309\ub2c8\ub2e4\ub78c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uae30\ucd08 \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uae30\ucd08 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc0f \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "LLM\uc758 \uac1c\uc120\uc774 FWMs\uc640 FAs\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc9c4\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "FWMs\uacfc \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ud070 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac80\uc99d\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uace0 \ud3c9\uac00\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378(FMs)\uacfc \uae30\ucd08 \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378(FWMs)\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uae30\ucd08 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8(FAs)\uac00 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc704\ud574 FMs\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 LLM(\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378) \uc138\ub300\uc5d0 \uc801\ud569\ud55c \uadf8\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc138\uacc4 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc2e4\uc99d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 LLM\uc758 \uac1c\uc120\uc774 FWMs \ubc0f FAs\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc9c0\uba70, \ud604\uc7ac LLM \uae30\ubc18 FAs\uac00 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\uace0, FWMs\uacfc \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uacb0\ud569\uc774 \ubd80\ubd84 \uad00\ucc30\uc131\uacfc \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uc694\uc18c\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ud070 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

The inability to access other agents' actions often leads\nto non-stationarity during value function updates and relative\novergeneralization during value function estimation, hindering effective\ncooperative policy learning. However, existing works fail to address both\nissues simultaneously, due to their inability to model the joint policy of\nother agents in a fully decentralized setting. To overcome this limitation, we\npropose a novel method named Dynamics-Aware Context (DAC), which formalizes the\ntask, as locally perceived by each agent, as an Contextual Markov Decision\nProcess, and further addresses both non-stationarity and relative\novergeneralization through dynamics-aware context modeling. Specifically, DAC\nattributes the non-stationary local task dynamics of each agent to switches\nbetween unobserved contexts, each corresponding to a distinct joint policy.\nThen, DAC models the step-wise dynamics distribution using latent variables and\nrefers to them as contexts. For each agent, DAC introduces a context-based\nvalue function to address the non-stationarity issue during value function\nupdate. For value function estimation, an optimistic marginal value is derived\nto promote the selection of cooperative actions, thereby addressing the\nrelative overgeneralization issue. Experimentally, we evaluate DAC on various\ncooperative tasks (including matrix game, predator and prey, and SMAC), and its\nsuperior performance against multiple baselines validates its effectiveness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc644\uc804 \ubd84\uc0b0 \ud611\ub825 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uba70, \uac01 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc0c1\ud0dc, \ub85c\uceec \ud589\ub3d9 \ubc0f \uacf5\uc720\ub41c \ubcf4\uc0c1\ub9cc\uc744 \uad00\ucc30\ud558\ub294 \uc0c1\ud669\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8f9\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ube44\uc815\ub958\uc131\uacfc \uc0c1\ub300\uc801 \uacfc\ub3c4 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294\ub370, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Dynamics-Aware Context(DAC)\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, the inherent heterogeneity and dynamicity of RL\nworkflows often lead to low hardware utilization and slow training on existing\nsystems. In this paper, we present RLinf, a high-performance RL training system\nbased on our key observation that the major roadblock to efficient RL training\nlies in system flexibility. To maximize flexibility and efficiency, RLinf is\nbuilt atop a novel RL system design paradigm called macro-to-micro flow\ntransformation (M2Flow), which automatically breaks down high-level,\neasy-to-compose RL workflows at both the temporal and spatial dimensions, and\nrecomposes them into optimized execution flows. Supported by RLinf worker's\nadaptive communication capability, we devise context switching and elastic\npipelining to realize M2Flow transformation, and a profiling-guided scheduling\npolicy to generate optimal execution plans. Extensive evaluations on both\nreasoning RL and embodied RL tasks demonstrate that RLinf consistently\noutperforms state-of-the-art systems, achieving 1.1x-2.13x speedup in\nend-to-end training throughput.", "AI": {"tldr": "RLinf\ub294 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uace0\uc131\ub2a5 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc73c\ub85c, M2Flow\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub514\uc790\uc778 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \ub290\ub9b0 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc18d\ub3c4\uac00 \ubb38\uc81c\uc600\ub2e4.", "method": "M2Flow \ub514\uc790\uc778 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub192\uc740 \uc218\uc900\uc758 RL \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\ub97c \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ud574 \ubc0f \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\ud589 \ud750\ub984\uc744 \uc7ac\uc870\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "RLinf\uac00 \uae30\uc874 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 1.1\ubc30\uc5d0\uc11c 2.13\ubc30 \ube60\ub974\uac8c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "RLinf\ub294 \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud568\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc740 \uc778\uacf5 \uc77c\ubc18 \uc9c0\ub2a5, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc9c0\ub2a5 \ubc0f \uad6c\ud604\ub41c \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\uc804\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ub370 \ud070 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 RL \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc758 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131\uacfc \ub3d9\uc801 \ud2b9\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uae30\uc874 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \ud65c\uc6a9\ub3c4\uac00 \ub0ae\uace0 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc18d\ub3c4\uac00 \ub290\ub9ac\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 RL \ud6c8\ub828\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc7a5\uc560\ubb3c\uc774 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc720\uc5f0\uc131\uc5d0 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uc8fc\uc694 \uad00\ucc30\uc744 \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uace0\uc131\ub2a5 RL \ud6c8\ub828 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc778 RLinf\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc720\uc5f0\uc131\uacfc \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, RLinf\ub294 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \ubc0f \uacf5\uac04\uc801 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc5d0\uc11c \ub192\uc740 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc26c\uc6b4 RL \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\ub97c \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\uace0 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub41c \uc2e4\ud589 \ud750\ub984\uc73c\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 RL \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ub514\uc790\uc778 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc778 \ub9e4\ud06c\ub85c-\ub9c8\uc774\ud06c\ub85c \ud750\ub984 \ubcc0\ud658(M2Flow) \uc704\uc5d0 \uad6c\ucd95\ub41c\ub2e4.

The prevalent single-query approach is simple, but\nsuffers from high estimation variance, motivating a multi-query paradigm to\nimproves estimation accuracy. This, however, creates a critical trade-off:\nunder a fixed budget of queries (i.e. cost), queries per iteration and the\ntotal number of optimization iterations are inversely proportional to one\nanother. How to best allocate this budget is a fundamental, under-explored\nquestion.\n  This work systematically resolves this query allocation problem. We analyze\ntwo aggregation methods: the de facto simple averaging (ZO-Avg), and a new\nProjection Alignment method (ZO-Align) we derive from local surrogate\nminimization. By deriving convergence rates for both methods that make the\ndependence on the number of queries explicit across strongly convex, convex,\nnon-convex, and stochastic settings, we uncover a stark dichotomy: For ZO-Avg,\nwe prove that using more than one query per iteration is always\nquery-inefficient, rendering the single-query approach optimal. On the\ncontrary, ZO-Align generally performs better with more queries per iteration,\nresulting in a full-subspace estimation as the optimal approach. Thus, our work\nclarifies that the multi-query problem boils down to a choice not about an\nintermediate query size, but between two classic algorithms, a choice dictated\nentirely by the aggregation method used.

We propose\nSmooth Policy Regularisation from Demonstrations (SPReD), a framework that\naddresses the fundamental question: when should an agent imitate a\ndemonstration versus follow its own policy? SPReD uses ensemble methods to\nexplicitly model Q-value distributions for both demonstration and policy\nactions, quantifying uncertainty for comparisons. We develop two complementary\nuncertainty-aware methods: a probabilistic approach estimating the likelihood\nof demonstration superiority, and an advantage-based approach scaling imitation\nby statistical significance. Unlike prevailing methods (e.g. Q-filter) that\nmake binary imitation decisions, SPReD applies continuous,\nuncertainty-proportional regularisation weights, reducing gradient variance\nduring training. Despite its computational simplicity, SPReD achieves\nremarkable gains in experiments across eight robotics tasks, outperforming\nexisting approaches by up to a factor of 14 in complex tasks while maintaining\nrobustness to demonstration quality and quantity.

Recent works discretize the reverse sampling process\nto enable GRPO-style training, yet they inherit fundamental drawbacks,\nincluding solver restrictions, forward-reverse inconsistency, and complicated\nintegration with classifier-free guidance (CFG). We introduce Diffusion\nNegative-aware FineTuning (DiffusionNFT), a new online RL paradigm that\noptimizes diffusion models directly on the forward process via flow matching.\nDiffusionNFT contrasts positive and negative generations to define an implicit\npolicy improvement direction, naturally incorporating reinforcement signals\ninto the supervised learning objective. This formulation enables training with\narbitrary black-box solvers, eliminates the need for likelihood estimation, and\nrequires only clean images rather than sampling trajectories for policy\noptimization.

However, their progress is fundamentally constrained by\nthe scarcity of scalable, high-quality trajectory data. Existing data\ncollection strategies either rely on costly and inconsistent manual annotations\nor on synthetic generation methods that trade off between diversity and\nmeaningful task coverage. To bridge this gap, we present GUI-ReWalk: a\nreasoning-enhanced, multi-stage framework for synthesizing realistic and\ndiverse GUI trajectories. GUI-ReWalk begins with a stochastic exploration phase\nthat emulates human trial-and-error behaviors, and progressively transitions\ninto a reasoning-guided phase where inferred goals drive coherent and\npurposeful interactions. Moreover, it supports multi-stride task generation,\nenabling the construction of long-horizon workflows across multiple\napplications. By combining randomness for diversity with goal-aware reasoning\nfor structure, GUI-ReWalk produces data that better reflects the intent-aware,\nadaptive nature of human-computer interaction. We further train Qwen2.5-VL-7B\non the GUI-ReWalk dataset and evaluate it across multiple benchmarks, including\nScreenspot-Pro, OSWorld-G, UI-Vision, AndroidControl, and GUI-Odyssey. Results\ndemonstrate that GUI-ReWalk enables superior coverage of diverse interaction\nflows, higher trajectory entropy, and more realistic user intent.

Our approach\nleverages estimated gradients of a Fenchel-Young loss through a\nnon-differentiable deterministic solver to shape the latent space. Unlike\nstandard Inverse Optimization or Inverse Reinforcement Learning methods, which\ntypically recover a single or context-specific cost function, IO-LVM captures a\ndistribution over cost functions, enabling the identification of diverse\nsolution behaviors arising from different agents or conditions not available\nduring the training process.

McClelland"], "title": "Latent learning: episodic memory complements parametric learning by enabling flexible reuse of experiences", "comment": null, "summary": "When do machine learning systems fail to generalize, and what mechanisms\ncould improve their generalization? Here, we draw inspiration from cognitive\nscience to argue that one weakness of machine learning systems is their failure\nto exhibit latent learning -- learning information that is not relevant to the\ntask at hand, but that might be useful in a future task. We show how this\nperspective links failures ranging from the reversal curse in language modeling\nto new findings on agent-based navigation. We then highlight how cognitive\nscience points to episodic memory as a potential part of the solution to these\nissues. Correspondingly, we show that a system with an oracle retrieval\nmechanism can use learning experiences more flexibly to generalize better\nacross many of these challenges. We also identify some of the essential\ncomponents for effectively using retrieval, including the importance of\nwithin-example in-context learning for acquiring the ability to use information\nacross retrieved examples. In summary, our results illustrate one possible\ncontributor to the relative data inefficiency of current machine learning\nsystems compared to natural intelligence, and help to understand how retrieval\nmethods can complement parametric learning to improve generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uc2e4\ud328 \uc774\uc720\uc640 \uc774\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c.", "motivation": "\uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uc2e4\ud328\ub97c \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ubaa8\uc0c9\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "\uc778\uc9c0 \uacfc\ud559\uc5d0\uc11c \uc601\uac10\uc744 \uc5bb\uc5b4 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uace0 \uc624\ub77c\ud074 \uac80\uc0c9 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uad6c\ud604\uc744 \uc81c\uc548.", "result": "\uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \ub354 \uc798 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \uc0ac\ub840 \ubc0f \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc.", "conclusion": "\ud604\uc7ac \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc774 \uc790\uc5f0 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc774\uc720\ub97c \uc124\uba85\ud558\uace0 \uac80\uc0c9 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc774\ud574\ub97c \ub3d5\ub294\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc5b8\uc81c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\uc5d0 \uc2e4\ud328\ud558\uba70, \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc740 \ubb34\uc5c7\uc778\uac00? \uc5ec\uae30\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc778\uc9c0 \uacfc\ud559\uc5d0\uc11c \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc544 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud55c \uac00\uc9c0 \uc57d\uc810\uc774 \uc791\uc5c5\uacfc \uad00\ub828 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \uc7a0\uc7ac \ud559\uc2b5(latent learning) \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc784\uc744 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \uad00\uc810\uc774 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc5ed\uc804 \uc800\uc8fc(reversal curse)\uc640 \ud589\ub3d9 \uae30\ubc18 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc1c\uacac\uc5d0 \uc774\ub974\ub294 \uc2e4\ud328\ub97c \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7f0 \ub2e4\uc74c, \uc778\uc9c0 \uacfc\ud559\uc774 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c \uc5d0\ud53c\uc18c\ub4dc \uae30\uc5b5(eposodic memory)\uc744 \uc9c0\uc801\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc624\ub77c\ud074 \uac80\uc0c9 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uac16\ucd98 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \ud559\uc2b5 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc744 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc720\uc5f0\ud558\uac8c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub3c4\uc804\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0\uc11c \ub354 \uc798 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac80\uc0c9\ub41c \uc0ac\ub840 \uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc2b5\ub4dd\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc608\uc2dc \ub0b4 \ubb38\ub9e5 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uc5ec \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\uc0c9\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uba87 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud544\uc218 \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc694\uc57d\ud558\uba74, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ud604\uc7ac \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc0c1\ub300\uc801 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc758 \ud55c \uac00\uc9c0 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \uc788\ub294 \uae30\uc5ec\uc790\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uace0, \uac80\uc0c9 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc644\ud558\uc5ec \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc744 \uc900\ub2e4."}}
