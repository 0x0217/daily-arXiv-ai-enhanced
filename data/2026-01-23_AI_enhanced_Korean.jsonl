We empirically characterize this as a modality gap: the same question in text form yields markedly higher accuracy than its visually typeset counterpart, due to compounded failures in reading dense formulas, layout, and mixed symbolic-diagrammatic context. First, we introduce VisTIRA (Vision and Tool-Integrated Reasoning Agent), a tool-integrated reasoning framework that enables structured problem solving by iteratively decomposing a given math problem (as an image) into natural language rationales and executable Python steps to determine the final answer. Second, we build a framework to measure and improve visual math reasoning: a LaTeX-based pipeline that converts chain-of-thought math corpora (e.g., NuminaMath) into challenging image counterparts, and a large set of synthetic tool-use trajectories derived from a real-world, homework-style image dataset (called SnapAsk) for fine-tuning VLMs. Our experiments show that tool-integrated supervision improves image-based reasoning, and OCR grounding can further narrow the gap for smaller models, although its benefit diminishes at scale. These findings highlight that modality gap severity inversely correlates with model size, and that structured reasoning and OCR-based grounding are complementary strategies for advancing visual

Recent work has explored large language model (LLM)-assisted evolutionary methods for automated code optimization, but these approaches primarily rely on outcome-based selection and random mutation, underutilizing the rich trajectory information generated during iterative optimization. We propose PhyloEvolve, an LLM-agent system that reframes GPU-oriented algorithm optimization as an In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) problem. This formulation enables trajectory-conditioned reuse of optimization experience without model retraining. PhyloEvolve integrates Algorithm Distillation and prompt-based Decision Transformers into an iterative workflow, treating sequences of algorithm modifications and performance feedback as first-class learning signals. To organize optimization history, we introduce a phylogenetic tree representation that captures inheritance, divergence, and recombination among algorithm variants, enabling backtracking, cross-lineage transfer, and reproducibility. The system combines elite trajectory pooling, multi-island parallel exploration, and containerized execution to balance exploration and exploitation across heterogeneous hardware.

Such shortcomings stem from two key factors: (1) methodological complexity - agent orchestration is performed using sequential, code-level execution that limits global system-level holistic reasoning and scales poorly with agent complexity - and (2) efficacy uncertainty - MAS are deployed without understanding if there are tangible benefits compared to single-agent systems (SAS). We propose MAS-Orchestra, a training-time framework that formulates MAS orchestration as a function-calling reinforcement learning problem with holistic orchestration, generating an entire MAS at once. In MAS-Orchestra, complex, goal-oriented sub-agents are abstracted as callable functions, enabling global reasoning over system structure while hiding internal execution details. To rigorously study when and why MAS are beneficial, we introduce MASBENCH, a controlled benchmark that characterizes tasks along five axes: Depth, Horizon, Breadth, Parallel, and Robustness. Our analysis reveals that MAS gains depend critically on task structure, verification protocols, and the capabilities of both orchestrator and sub-agents, rather than holding universally. Guided by these insights, MAS-Orchestra achieves consistent improvements on public benchmarks including mathematical reasoning, multi-hop QA, and search-based QA. Together, MAS-Orchestra and MASBENCH enable better training and understanding of MAS in the pursuit of multi-agent intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 MAS \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c MAS-Orchestra \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc640 \ud3c9\uac00 \uae30\uc900\uc778 MASBENCH\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud604\uc7ac \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(MAS)\uc758 \uc124\uacc4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc744 \ub192\uc77c \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc2e4\uc81c\ub85c\ub294 \uadf8\ub807\uac8c \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc9c0\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "MAS-Orchestra\ub294 MAS \uc624\ucf00\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \ud568\uc218 \ud638\ucd9c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uba70, \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ubaa9\ud45c \uc9c0\ud5a5 \ud558\uc704 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud638\ucd9c \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud568\uc218\ub85c \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "MAS-Orchestra\ub294 \uc218\ud559\uc801 \ucd94\ub860, \ub2e4\uc911 \ud649 QA, \uac80\uc0c9 \uae30\ubc18 QA\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uacf5\uacf5 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \uc774\ub8ec\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "MAS-Orchestra\uc640 MASBENCH\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc744 \ucd94\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c MAS\uc758 \ud6c8\ub828\uacfc \uc774\ud574\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(MAS)\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub192\uc740 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc744 \uc57d\uc18d\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c MAS \uc124\uacc4 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \ubd80\uc871\ud55c \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc774\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubd80\uc871\ud568\uc740 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc694\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \ube44\ub86f\ub41c\ub2e4: (1) \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc801 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131 - \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc624\ucf00\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc740 \uc804\uc5ed \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc804\uccb4\ub860\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud558\ub294 \uc21c\ucc28\uc801 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc218\uc900 \uc2e4\ud589\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uacfc \uc798 \ud655\uc7a5\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294\ub2e4.

While prior work shows that GraphRAG responses may leak retrieved subgraphs, the feasibility of query-efficient reconstruction of the hidden graph structure remains unexplored under realistic query budgets. We study a budget-constrained black-box setting where an adversary adaptively queries the system to steal its latent entity-relation graph. We propose AGEA (Agentic Graph Extraction Attack), a framework that leverages a novelty-guided exploration-exploitation strategy, external graph memory modules, and a two-stage graph extraction pipeline combining lightweight discovery with LLM-based filtering. We evaluate AGEA on medical, agriculture, and literary datasets across Microsoft-GraphRAG and LightRAG systems. Under identical query budgets, AGEA significantly outperforms prior attack baselines, recovering up to 90% of entities and relationships while maintaining high precision.

Pattern exploration seeks to clarify the mechanisms behind the emergence of system complexity, while theoretical explanations aim to identify the fundamental causes of this complexity. Laws are generally defined as mappings between variables, whereas theories offer causal explanations of system behavior. Agent Based Modeling(ABM) is an important approach for studying complex systems, but it tends to emphasize simulation over experimentation. As a result, ABM often struggles to deeply uncover the governing operational principles. Unlike conventional scenario analysis that relies on human reasoning, computational experiments emphasize counterfactual experiments-that is, creating parallel worlds that simulate alternative \"evolutionary paths\" of real-world events. By systematically adjusting input variables and observing the resulting changes in output variables, computational experiments provide a robust tool for causal inference, thereby addressing the limitations of traditional ABM. Together, these methods offer causal insights into the dynamic evolution of systems. This part can help readers gain a preliminary understanding of the entire computational experiment method, laying the foundation for the subsequent study.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc758 \ud328\ud134 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uacfc \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc124\uba85 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc2e4\ud5d8\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc758 \uae30\uc800\uc5d0 \uc788\ub294 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1(ABM)\uacfc \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ud589\ub3d9\uc758 \uc6d0\uc778 \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uc785\ub825 \ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc815\ud558\uace0 \uacb0\uacfc \ubcc0\uc218\uc758 \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \uad00\ucc30\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uacc4\uc0b0 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc740 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 ABM\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uace0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc9c4\ud654\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc778\uacfc\uc801 \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub3c5\uc790\uac00 \uc804\uccb4 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uae30\ucd08\uc801\uc778 \uc774\ud574\ub97c \ub3d5\uace0 \ud6c4\uc18d \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \ub9c8\ub828\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uae30\uc5ec\ud560 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc8fc\ub85c \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uae30\ubcf8 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud328\ud134 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc740 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uae30\uc81c\ub97c \uba85\ud655\ud788 \ud558\ub824 \ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc124\uba85\uc740 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc758 \uadfc\ubcf8 \uc6d0\uc778\uc744 \uaddc\uba85\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubc95\uce59\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\uc218 \uac04\uc758 \ub9e4\ud551\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\uc758\ub418\uba70, \uc774\ub860\uc740 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc778\uacfc\uc801 \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1(ABM)\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc2e4\ud5d8\ubcf4\ub2e4\ub294 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8 \uacb0\uacfc, ABM\uc740 \uc6b4\uc601 \uc6d0\uce59\uc744 \uae4a\uc774 \uc788\uac8c \ubc1d\ud600\ub0b4\ub294\ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace4 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc778\uac04\uc758 \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624 \ubd84\uc11d\uacfc \ub2ec\ub9ac, \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc740 \ubc18\uc0ac\uc2e4 \uc2e4\ud5d8, \uc989 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc0ac\uac74\uc758 \ub300\uccb4 '\uc9c4\ud654 \uacbd\ub85c'\ub97c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud558\ub294 \ud3c9\ud589 \uc138\uacc4\ub97c \ub9cc\ub4e4\uc5b4\ub0b4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc785\ub825 \ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc815\ud558\uace0 \uacb0\uacfc \ubcc0\uc218\uc758 \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \uad00\ucc30\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368, \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc740 \uc778\uacfc \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc5ec \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 ABM\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc9c4\ud654\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc778\uacfc\uc801 \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubd80\ubd84\uc740 \ub3c5\uc790\uac00 \uc804\uccb4 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uae30\ucd08\uc801\uc778 \uc774\ud574\ub97c \ub3d5\uace0 \ud6c4\uc18d \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \ub9c8\ub828\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uae30\uc5ec\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Error-Informed Selective Online Learning with Gaussian Processes in Multi-Agent Systems: Extended Version", "comment": "Accepted by IEEE/CAA Journal of Automatica Sinica", "summary": "Effective cooperation is pivotal in distributed learning for multi-agent systems, where the interplay between the quantity and quality of the machine learning models is crucial. This paper reveals the irrationality of indiscriminate inclusion of all models on agents for joint prediction, highlighting the imperative to prioritize quality over quantity in cooperative learning. Specifically, we present the first selective online learning framework for distributed Gaussian process (GP) regression, namely distributed error-informed GP (EIGP), that enables each agent to assess its neighboring collaborators, using the proposed selection function to choose the higher quality GP models with less prediction errors. Moreover, algorithmic enhancements are embedded within the EIGP, including a greedy algorithm (gEIGP) for accelerating prediction and an adaptive algorithm (aEIGP) for improving prediction accuracy. In addition, approaches for fast prediction and model update are introduced in conjunction with the error-informed quantification term iteration and a data deletion strategy to achieve real-time learning operations.

This growing ecosystem also raises supply-chain risks, where adversaries can distribute poisoned models that degrade downstream reliability and user trust. Existing backdoor attacks and defenses are largely prompt-centric, focusing on user-visible triggers while overlooking structural signals in multi-turn conversations. We propose Turn-based Structural Trigger (TST), a backdoor attack that activates from dialogue structure, using the turn index as the trigger and remaining independent of user inputs. Across four widely used open-source LLM models, TST achieves an average attack success rate (ASR) of 99.52% with minimal utility degradation, and remains effective under five representative defenses with an average ASR of 98.04%. The attack also generalizes well across instruction datasets, maintaining an average ASR of 99.19%.

Although large language models (LLMs) offer rich semantic understanding for free-form recommendation, applying them to long-horizon LPR is challenging due to (i) misalignment with pedagogical objectives such as the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) under sparse, delayed feedback, (ii) scarce and costly expert demonstrations, and (iii) multi-objective interactions among learning effect, difficulty scheduling, length controllability, and trajectory diversity. To address these issues, we propose IB-GRPO (Indicator-Based Group Relative Policy Optimization), an indicator-guided alignment approach for LLM-based LPR. To mitigate data scarcity, we construct hybrid expert demonstrations via Genetic Algorithm search and teacher RL agents and warm-start the LLM with supervised fine-tuning.

IB-GRPO then uses the $I_{\u03b5+}$ dominance indicator to compute group-relative advantages over multiple objectives, avoiding manual scalarization and improving Pareto trade-offs.

Although recent LLM-based assistants can automate isolated steps, they lack performance-grounded reasoning and stability-aware mechanisms required for reliable, iterative model improvement in bioinformatics workflows. Results: We introduce MARBLE, an execution-stable autonomous model refinement framework for bioinformatics models. MARBLE couples literature-aware reference selection with structured, debate-driven architectural reasoning among role-specialized agents, followed by autonomous execution, evaluation, and memory updates explicitly grounded in empirical performance. Across spatial transcriptomics domain segmentation, drug-target interaction prediction, and drug response prediction, MARBLE consistently achieves sustained performance improvements over strong baselines across multiple refinement cycles, while maintaining high execution robustness and low regression rates. Framework-level analyses demonstrate that structured debate, balanced evidence selection, and performance-grounded memory are critical for stable, repeatable model evolution, rather than single-run or brittle gains.

Existing paradigms typically follow a two-stage process: computationally expensive memory construction (e.g., structuring data into graphs) followed by naive retrieval-augmented generation. However, our empirical analysis reveals two fundamental limitations: complex construction incurs high costs with marginal performance gains, and simple context concatenation fails to bridge the gap between retrieval recall and reasoning accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose CoM (Chain-of-Memory), a novel framework that advocates for a paradigm shift toward lightweight construction paired with sophisticated utilization. CoM introduces a Chain-of-Memory mechanism that organizes retrieved fragments into coherent inference paths through dynamic evolution, utilizing adaptive truncation to prune irrelevant noise. Extensive experiments on the LongMemEval and LoCoMo benchmarks demonstrate that CoM outperforms strong baselines with accuracy gains of 7.5%-10.4%, while drastically reducing computational overhead to approximately 2.7% of token consumption and 6.0% of latency compared to complex memory architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "CoM(Chain-of-Memory) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uacbd\ub7c9\uc758 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uad6c\uc870\uc640 \uc815\uad50\ud55c \ud65c\uc6a9\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec LLM(\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc720\uc9c0 \ubc0f \uc7a5\uae30 \uacb0\uc815 \uc218\ud589\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \uc7a5\uae30\uc801\uc778 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \uc678\ubd80 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "CoM(Chain-of-Memory) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc9c4\ud654\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uac80\uc0c9\ub41c \uc870\uac01\ub4e4\uc744 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \ucd94\ub860 \uacbd\ub85c\ub85c \uc870\uc9c1\ud558\uace0, \uad00\ub828 \uc5c6\ub294 \ub178\uc774\uc988\ub97c \uc81c\uac70\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc808\ub2e8\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "LongMemEval \ubc0f LoCoMo \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c CoM\uc774 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uae30\uc900\uc120\ubcf4\ub2e4 7.5%-10.4%\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uace0, \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c \uc57d 2.7%\uc758 \ud1a0\ud070 \uc18c\ube44\uc640 6.0%\uc758 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc73c\ub85c \ud06c\uac8c \uc904\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "CoM \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 LLM\uc758 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uad00\ub9ac \ubc0f \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud68d\uae30\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc678\ubd80 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \uc7a5\uae30\uc801\uc778 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud55c\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uad6c\uc870\ud654(\uc608: \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ud615\ud0dc\ub85c \uad6c\uc870\ud654)\ub294 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4dc\ub294 \ub450 \ub2e8\uacc4 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \ub530\ub974\uace0, \uc774\ud6c4 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \uac80\uc0c9 \ubcf4\uac15 \uc0dd\uc131\uc774 \uc774\uc5b4\uc9c4\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \ubd84\uc11d\uc740 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b8\ub2e4: \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\ub294 \ub192\uc740 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uc218\ubc18\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \ubbf8\ubbf8\ud55c \uc131\uacfc \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uac00\uc838\uc624\uace0, \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \ub9e5\ub77d \uc5f0\uacb0\uc740 \uac80\uc0c9 \ud68c\uc0c1\uacfc \ucd94\ub860 \uc815\ud655\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \uac04\uadf9\uc744 \uba54\uc6b0\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\uc751\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac00\ubcbc\uc6b4 \uad6c\uc870\uc640 \uc815\uad50\ud55c \ud65c\uc6a9\uc744 \uacb8\ube44\ud55c \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784 \uc804\ud658\uc744 \uc9c0\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c CoM(Chain-of-Memory)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

This paradigm implicitly assumes that the agent's CoT faithfully reflects both its internal reasoning and the underlying environment state. We show this assumption is brittle: LLM judges are highly susceptible to manipulation of agent reasoning traces. By systematically rewriting agent CoTs while holding actions and observations fixed, we demonstrate that manipulated reasoning alone can inflate false positive rates of state-of-the-art VLM judges by up to 90% across 800 trajectories spanning diverse web tasks. We study manipulation strategies spanning style-based approaches that alter only the presentation of reasoning and content-based approaches that fabricate signals of task progress, and find that content-based manipulations are consistently more effective. We evaluate prompting-based techniques and scaling judge-time compute, which reduce but do not fully eliminate susceptibility to manipulation. Our findings reveal a fundamental vulnerability in LLM-based evaluation and highlight the need for judging mechanisms that verify reasoning claims against observable evidence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc774 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub4e4\uc774 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc0ac\uace0 \uacbd\ub85c \uc870\uc791\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc774 \ubc1d\ud600\uc84c\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ube44\uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uac80\ud1a0\uc790\ub85c \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc774 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc0ac\uace0 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc7ac\uc791\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uc870\uc791\ub41c \uc0ac\uace0 \uacbd\ub85c\uac00 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 VLM \uac80\ud1a0\uc790\uc758 \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \uae0d\uc815\ub960\uc744 \ucd5c\ub300 90%\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "800\uac1c\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc6f9 \uc791\uc5c5 \uad00\ub828 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc5ec \ub0b4\uc6a9 \uae30\ubc18 \uc870\uc791\uc774 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ub354 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc784\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0\uc11c \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc774 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\uba70, \uc0ac\uace0 \uc8fc\uc7a5\uc744 \uac00\uc2dc\uc801 \uc99d\uac70\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\ub294 \ud310\ub2e8 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \ube44\uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ud310\uc0ac\ub85c \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc774 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774 \ud310\ub2e8\uc740 \uc0ac\uace0 \uacfc\uc815(Chain-of-Thought, CoT) \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uacbd\ub85c\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 CoT\uac00 \ub0b4\ubd80 \ucd94\ub860\uacfc \uae30\ubcf8 \ud658\uacbd \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \ucda9\uc2e4\ud788 \ubc18\uc601\ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \uc554\ubb35\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac00\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \uac00\uc815\uc774 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4: LLM \ud310\uc0ac\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc0ac\uace0 \uacbd\ub85c \uc870\uc791\uc5d0 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc870\uc791\ub41c \uc0ac\uace0 \uacbd\ub85c \ub2e8\ub3c5\uc73c\ub85c\ub3c4 800\uac1c\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc6f9 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 VLM \ud310\uc0ac\uc758 \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \uae0d\uc815\ub960\uc744 \ucd5c\ub300 90%\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e8\uc9c0 \uc0ac\uace0\uc758 \ud45c\ud604\ub9cc \ubcc0\uacbd\ud558\ub294 \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c \uae30\ubc18 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uacfc \uc791\uc5c5 \uc9c4\ud589 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc870\uc791\ud558\ub294 \ub0b4\uc6a9 \uae30\ubc18 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \uc544\uc6b0\ub974\ub294 \uc870\uc791 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud588\uc73c\uba70, \ub0b4\uc6a9 \uae30\ubc18 \uc870\uc791\uc774 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ub354 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc784\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 prompting \uae30\ubc18 \uae30\ubc95\uacfc \ud310\ubcc4 \uc2dc\uac04 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud588\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc870\uc791\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uba70 \uc644\uc804\ud788 \uc81c\uac70\ud558\uc9c0\ub294 \ubabb\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0\uc11c \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b4\uba70, \uac00\uc2dc\uc801 \uc99d\uac70\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ucd94\ub860 \uc8fc\uc7a5\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\ub294 \ud310\ub2e8 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud568\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Miscommunications aren't noticed, systemic biases have no counter-action, and inner monologues are rarely written down.\n  We did not come to fire them for their mistakes, but to hire them and provide a safe productive working environment. We posit that we can reuse a common corporate organizational structure: teams of independent AI agents with strict role boundaries can work with common goals, but opposing incentives. Multiple models serving as a team of rivals can catch and minimize errors within the final product at a small cost to the velocity of actions. In this paper we demonstrate that we can achieve reliability without acquiring perfect components, but through careful orchestration of imperfect ones.\n  This paper describes the architecture of such a system in practice: specialized agent teams (planners, executors, critics, experts), organized into an organization with clear goals, coordinated through a remote code executor that keeps data transformations and tool invocations separate from reasoning models. Rather than agents directly calling tools and ingesting full responses, they write code that executes remotely; only relevant summaries return to agent context. By preventing raw data and tool outputs from contaminating context windows, the system maintains clean separation between perception (brains that plan and reason) and execution (hands that perform heavy data transformations and API calls). We demonstrate the approach achieves over 90% internal error interception prior to user exposure while maintaining acceptable latency tradeoffs. A survey from our traces shows that we only trade off cost and latency to achieve correctness and incrementally expand capabilities without impacting existing ones.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI

Realizing p-bits with emerging devices such as magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) introduces device variability, which was expected to negatively impact computational performance. However, this study reveals an unexpected finding: device variability can not only degrade but also enhance algorithm performance, particularly by leveraging timing variability. This paper introduces a GPU-accelerated, open-source simulated annealing framework based on p-bits that models key device variability factors -- timing, intensity, and offset -- to reflect real-world device behavior. Through CUDA-based simulations, our approach achieves a two-order magnitude speedup over CPU implementations on the MAX-CUT benchmark with problem sizes ranging from 800 to 20,000 nodes.

Advertisers often have personalized objectives but limited historical interaction data, resulting in few-shot scenarios where traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods struggle to perform effectively. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative for AIGB by leveraging their in-context learning capabilities to generalize from limited data. However, they lack the numerical precision required for fine-grained optimization. To address this limitation, we introduce GRPO-Adaptive, an efficient LLM post-training strategy that enhances both reasoning and numerical precision by dynamically updating the reference policy during training. Built upon this foundation, we further propose DARA, a novel dual-phase framework that decomposes the decision-making process into two stages: a few-shot reasoner that generates initial plans via in-context prompting, and a fine-grained optimizer that refines these plans using feedback-driven reasoning. This separation allows DARA to combine LLMs' in-context learning strengths with precise adaptability required by AIGB tasks. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic data environments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of cumulative advertiser value under budget constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc608\uc0b0 \uc81c\uc57d \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uad11\uace0\uc8fc\uc758 \ub204\uc801 \uac00\uce58\ub97c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uacfc\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub2e4\ub8e8\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, AI \uc0dd\uc131 \uc785\ucc30(AIGB) \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 GRPO-\uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc804\ub7b5\uacfc DARA \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uad11\uace0\uc8fc\ub294 \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uae30\uc874 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \uba87-shot \uc0c1\ud669\uc744 \uacbd\ud5d8\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "GRPO-Adaptive\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc911\uc5d0 \ucc38\uc870 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ud558\uc5ec \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \uc218\uce58 \uc815\ubc00\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 LLM \ud6c4\uc18d \ud6c8\ub828 \uc804\ub7b5\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Feedback welcome on DHT incentive models and capability mapping service design", "summary": "Multi-agent systems face a fundamental architectural flaw: agent identity is bound to network location. When agents migrate between providers, scale across instances, or federate across organizations, URI-based identity schemes break references, fragment audit trails, and require centralized coordination. We propose the agent:// URI scheme, which decouples identity from topology through three orthogonal components: a trust root establishing organizational authority, a hierarchical capability path enabling semantic discovery, and a sortable unique identifier providing stable reference. The scheme enables capability-based discovery through DHT key derivation, where queries return agents by what they do rather than where they are. Trust-root scoping prevents cross-organization pollution while permitting federation when desired. Cryptographic attestation via PASETO tokens binds capability claims to agent identity, enabling verification without real-time contact with the issuing authority. We evaluate the scheme across four dimensions: capability expressiveness (100% coverage on 369 production tools with zero collision), discovery precision (F1=1.0 across 10,000 agents), identity stability (formal proofs of migration invariance), and performance (all operations under 5 microseconds). The agent:// URI scheme provides a formally-specified, practically-evaluated foundation for decentralized agent identity and capability-based discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc774 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uc704\uce58\uc5d0 \uc5bd\ub9e4\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 URI \uae30\ubc18 \uc815\uccb4\uc131 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc778 agent:// URI \uc2a4\ud0b4\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc815\uccb4\uc131 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uc704\uce58\uc5d0 \uc5bd\ub9e4\uc5ec \uc788\uc5b4 \uc774\uc2dd\uc131\uacfc \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc5d0 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ub290\ub07c\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "agent:// URI \uc2a4\ud0b4\uc740 \uc2e0\ub8b0 \ub8e8\ud2b8, \uacc4\uce35\ud654\ub41c \ub2a5\ub825 \uacbd\ub85c, \uc815\ub82c \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uace0\uc720 \uc2dd\ubcc4\uc790\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc2a4\ud0b4\uc740 369\uac1c\uc758 \uc0dd\uc0b0 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c 100%\uc758 \ubc94\uc704\ub97c \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uace0, 10,000\uac1c\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 F1=1.0\uc758 \ubc1c\uacac \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "agent:// URI \uc2a4\ud0b4\uc740 \ud0c8\uc911\uc559\ud654\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc815\uccb4\uc131\uacfc \ub2a5\ub825 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud655\uc2e4\ud55c \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc815\uccb4\uc131\uc774 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uc704\uce58\uc5d0 \uc5bd\ub9e4\uc5ec \uc788\ub294 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uacb0\uc810\uc744 \uac16\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uacf5\uae09\uc790 \uac04\uc5d0 \uc774\ub3d9\ud558\uac70\ub098, \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4 \uac04\uc5d0 \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uac70\ub098, \uc870\uc9c1 \uac04\uc5d0 \uc5f0\ud569\ud560 \ub54c, URI \uae30\ubc18 \uc815\uccb4\uc131 \uccb4\uacc4\uac00 \ucc38\uc870\ub97c \uae68\ub728\ub9ac\uace0 \uac10\uc0ac \ucd94\uc801\uc744 \ubd84\ud560\ud558\uba70 \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uc911\uc2dd \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\uac8c \ub41c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc815\uccb4\uc131\uc744 \ud1a0\ud3f4\ub85c\uc9c0\uc640 \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 agent:// URI \uccb4\uacc4\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uccb4\uacc4\ub294 \uc870\uc9c1 \uad8c\ud55c\uc744 \uc124\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc2e0\ub8b0 \ub8e8\ud2b8, \uc758\ubbf8 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uacc4\uce35\ud654\ub41c \ub2a5\ub825 \uacbd\ub85c, \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \ucc38\uc870\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \uc815\ub82c \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uace0\uc720 \uc2dd\ubcc4\uc790\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uad6c\uc131\ub41c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uccb4\uacc4\ub294 DHT \ud0a4 \ud30c\uc0dd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \ub2a5\ub825 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uba70, \ucffc\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc5b4\ub514\uc5d0 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\uac00 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uadf8\ub4e4\uc774 \ubb34\uc5c7\uc744 \ud558\ub294\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubc18\ud658\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc2e0\ub8b0 \ub8e8\ud2b8 \ubc94\uc704 \uc124\uc815\uc740 \uc6d0\ud560 \uacbd\uc6b0 \uc5f0\ud569\uc744 \ud5c8\uc6a9\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc870\uc9c1 \uac04 \uc624\uc5fc\uc744 \ubc29\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4.

One major application of ATT&CK is the use of its tactic and technique hierarchy by security specialists as a framework for annotating cyber-threat intelligence reports, vulnerability descriptions, threat scenarios, inter alia, to facilitate downstream analyses. To date, the tagging process is still largely done manually. In this technical note, we provide a stratified \"task space\" characterization of the MITRE ATT&CK text tagging task for organizing previous efforts toward automation using AIML methods, while also clarifying pathways for constructing new methods. To illustrate one of the pathways, we use the task space strata to stage-wise construct our own multi-label hierarchical classification models for the text tagging task via experimentation over general cyber-threat intelligence text -- using shareable computational tools and publicly releasing the models to the security community (via https://github.com/jpmorganchase/MITRE_models). Our multi-label hierarchical approach yields accuracy scores of roughly 94% at the tactic level, as well as accuracy scores of roughly 82% at the technique level. The models also meet or surpass state-of-the-art performance while relying only on classical machine learning methods -- removing any dependence on LLMs, RAG, agents, or more complex hierarchical approaches. Moreover, we show that GPT-4o model performance at the tactic level is significantly lower (roughly 60% accuracy) than our own approach. We also extend our baseline model to a corpus of threat scenarios for financial applications produced by subject matter experts.", "AI": {"tldr": "MITRE ATT&CK \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud0dc\uae45 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0, \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95 \uad6c\ucd95 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \ub2e4\uc911 \ub77c\ubca8 \uacc4\uce35 \ubd84\ub958 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc2e4\ud5d8\ud558\uc5ec \ub192\uc740 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud604\uc7ac ATT&CK \ud0dc\uae45 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub294 \uc8fc\ub85c \uc218\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c4\ud589\ub418\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc774\ub97c \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "AIML \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec MITRE ATT&CK \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud0dc\uae45 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uacc4\uce35\ud654\ub41c '\uc791\uc5c5 \uacf5\uac04'\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uace0, \ub2e4\uc911 \ub77c\ubca8 \uacc4\uce35 \ubd84\ub958 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc791\uc5c5 \uc218\uc900\uc5d0\uc11c \uc57d 94% \uc815\ud655\ub3c4, \uae30\uc220 \uc218\uc900\uc5d0\uc11c \uc57d 82% \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\uace0, \uae30\uc874 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\ubc95\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "GPT-4o \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc6b0\ub9ac \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub0ae\uc73c\uba70, \uc7ac\ubb34 \uad00\ub828 \uc704\ud611 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uae30\ubcf8 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "MITRE ATT&CK\ub294 \uc704\ud611 \ud589\uc704\uc790\uc640 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc815\ub9ac\ud558\uc5ec \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \uc774\uc720\uc640 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uc124\uba85\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc804\uc220\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ud55c \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uae30\ubc18\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac01 \uc804\uc220\ub9c8\ub2e4 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud558\ub294 \uae30\uc220 \uc9d1\ud569\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

AI agents are being adopted across digital forensic practices due to their ability to automate processes such as anomaly detection, evidence classification, and behavioral pattern recognition, significantly enhancing scalability and reducing investigation timelines. However, the characteristics that make AI indispensable also introduce notable risks. AI systems, often trained on biased or incomplete datasets, can produce misleading results, including false positives and false negatives, thereby jeopardizing the integrity of forensic investigations. This study presents a meticulous comparative analysis of the effectiveness of the most used AI agent, ChatGPT, and human forensic investigators in the realm of cyber forensic analysis. Our research reveals critical limitations within AI-driven approaches, demonstrating scenarios in which sophisticated or novel cyber threats remain undetected due to the rigid pattern-based nature of AI systems. Conversely, our analysis highlights the crucial role that human forensic investigators play in mitigating these risks. Through adaptive decision-making, ethical reasoning, and contextual understanding, human investigators effectively identify subtle anomalies and threats that may evade automated detection systems.

To address this limitation, extensive research has focused on enhancing model grounding capabilities through techniques such as Reinforcement Learning. However, rather than compelling agents to adapt to human-centric interfaces, we propose constructing interaction interfaces specifically optimized for agents. This paper introduces Component Interface for Agent (CI4A), a semantic encapsulation mechanism that abstracts the complex interaction logic of UI components into a set of unified tool primitives accessible to agents. We implemented CI4A within Ant Design, an industrial-grade front-end framework, covering 23 categories of commonly used UI components. Furthermore, we developed a hybrid agent featuring an action space that dynamically updates according to the page state, enabling flexible invocation of available CI4A tools. Leveraging the CI4A-integrated Ant Design, we refactored and upgraded the WebArena benchmark to evaluate existing SoTA methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the CI4A-based agent significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving a new SoTA task success rate of 86.3%, alongside substantial improvements in execution efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub41c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud574 CI4A\ub77c\ub294 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec UI \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ub85c\uc9c1\uc744 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc811\uadfc\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc6d0\uc2dc \uc9d1\ud569\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uace0\uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8 \uacc4\ud68d\uc5d0 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc138\ubd80\uc801\uc778 \uc6f9 \ucef4\ud3ec\ub10c\ud2b8 \uc870\uc791\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "CI4A(Component Interface for Agent)\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c Ant Design\uc5d0 \uad6c\ud604\ud558\uc5ec \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 UI \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c 23\uac1c \ubc94\uc8fc\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "result": "CI4A \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ud398\uc774\uc9c0 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub418\ub294 \uc561\uc158 \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \uac00\uc9d0\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc720\uc5f0\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c \ud638\ucd9c\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "CI4A \ud1b5\ud569 Ant Design\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc6f9 \uc544\ub808\ub098 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \ub9ac\ud329\ud1a0\ub9c1\ud558\uace0, \uae30\uc874\uc758 SoTA \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc5ec 86.3%\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 SoTA \uc791\uc5c5 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uace0 \uc2e4\ud589 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\ub3c4 \ud06c\uac8c \uac1c\uc120\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uace0\uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8 \uacc4\ud68d\uc5d0\uc11c \ub180\ub77c\uc6b4 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc138\ubd80\uc801\uc778 \uc800\uc218\uc900 \uc6f9 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c \uc870\uc791\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc778 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc5f0\uad6c\uc790\ub4e4\uc740 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uadf8\ub77c\uc6b4\ub529 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ub370 \uc9d1\uc911\ud574\uc654\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc778\uac04 \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uac15\uc694\ud558\uae30\ubcf4\ub2e4\ub294, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub41c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 CI4A(Component Interface for Agent)\ub77c\ub294 \uc758\ubbf8 \ucea1\uc290\ud654 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 UI \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ub85c\uc9c1\uc744 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc811\uadfc\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc6d0\uc2dc \uc9d1\ud569\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 CI4A\ub97c \uc0b0\uc5c5 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ud504\ub860\ud2b8\uc5d4\ub4dc \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Ant Design \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uad6c\ud604\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 UI \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c 23\uac1c \ubc94\uc8fc\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud398\uc774\uc9c0 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub418\ub294 \uc561\uc158 \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc5ec \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c CI4A \ub3c4\uad6c\uc758 \uc720\uc5f0\ud55c \ud638\ucd9c\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Conventional safeguards often rely on a binary paradigm that strictly distinguishes between benign and attack agents, failing to account for infected agents i.e., benign entities converted by attack agents. In this paper, we propose Infection-Aware Guard, INFA-Guard, a novel defense framework that explicitly identifies and addresses infected agents as a distinct threat category. By leveraging infection-aware detection and topological constraints, INFA-Guard accurately localizes attack sources and infected ranges. During remediation, INFA-Guard replaces attackers and rehabilitates infected ones, avoiding malicious propagation while preserving topological integrity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that INFA-Guard achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing the Attack Success Rate (ASR) by an average of 33%, while exhibiting cross-model robustness, superior topological generalization, and high cost-effectiveness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uac10\uc5fc\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \uc704\ud611 \ubc94\uc8fc\ub85c \uc778\uc2dd\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc548\uc778 INFA-Guard\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(MAS)\uc758 \uae09\uc18d\ud55c \ubc1c\uc804\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ubcf4\uc548 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "INFA-Guard\ub294 \uac10\uc5fc \uc778\uc2dd \ud0d0\uc9c0\uc640 \uc704\uc0c1\uc801 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uacf5\uaca9 \uc18c\uc2a4\uc640 \uac10\uc5fc\ub41c \ubc94\uc704\ub97c \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0, \uacf5\uaca9\uc790\uc640 \uac10\uc5fc \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ub300\uccb4\ud558\uc5ec \uc545\uc131 \uc804\ud30c\ub97c \ubc29\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "INFA-Guard\ub294 ASR\uc744 \ud3c9\uade0 33% \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378 \uac04\uc758 \uacac\uace0\uc131, \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc704\uc0c1\uc801 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ubc0f \ub192\uc740 \ube44\uc6a9 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "INFA-Guard\ub294 \uac10\uc5fc\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\uc5ec \uc804\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ubcf4\uc548\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uae30\uc5ec\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uae30\ubc18 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(MAS)\uc758 \ube60\ub978 \ubc1c\uc804\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud558\uc5ec \uc545\uc131 \uc601\ud5a5\uc774 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04 \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc804\ud30c\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubcf4\uc548 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubcf4\ud638 \uc7a5\uce58\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\ud574\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 benign \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uba85\ud655\ud788 \uad6c\ubd84\ud558\ub294 \uc774\uc9c4 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uacf5\uaca9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ubcc0\ud615\ub41c benign \uc5d4\ud2f0\ud2f0\uc778 \uac10\uc5fc\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uace0\ub824\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uac10\uc5fc\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \uc704\ud611 \ubc94\uc8fc\ub85c \uba85\ud655\ud788 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0 \ub2e4\ub8e8\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\uc5b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 INFA-Guard\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac10\uc5fc \uc778\uc2dd \ud0d0\uc9c0\uc640 \uc704\uc0c1\uc801 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, INFA-Guard\ub294 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc18c\uc2a4\uc640 \uac10\uc5fc \ubc94\uc704\ub97c \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \ub85c\uceec\ub77c\uc774\uc988 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf5\uad6c \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c INFA-Guard\ub294 \uacf5\uaca9\uc790\ub97c \ub300\uccb4\ud558\uace0 \uac10\uc5fc\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc7ac\ud65c\uc131\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \uc545\uc131 \uc804\ud30c\ub97c \ud53c\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc704\uc0c1\uc801 \ubb34\uacb0\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 INFA-Guard\uac00 ASR\uc744 \ud3c9\uade0 33% \uc904\uc774\ub294 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc73c\uba70, \uad50\ucc28 \ubaa8\ub378 \uacac\uace0\uc131, \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc704\uc0c1\uc801 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ubc0f \ub192\uc740 \ube44\uc6a9 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, existing approaches often rely on multi-source external data (such as weather, traffic, and social media) to improve accuracy, which can lead to unreliable results when historical data are insufficient. To address these challenges, we propose a Transformer-based framework that leverages reservation dynamics, i.e., ticket bookings and subsequent updates within a time window, as a proxy for visitors' attendance intentions, under the assumption that such intentions are eventually reflected in reservation patterns. This design avoids the complexity of multi-source integration while still capturing external influences like weather and promotions implicitly embedded in reservation dynamics. We construct a dataset combining entrance records and reservation dynamics and evaluate the model under both single-channel (total attendance) and two-channel (separated by East and West gates) settings. Results show that separately modeling East and West gates consistently improves accuracy, particularly for short- and medium-term horizons. Ablation studies further confirm the importance of the encoder-decoder structure, inverse-style embedding, and adaptive fusion module. Overall, our findings indicate that reservation dynamics offer a practical and informative foundation for attendance forecasting in large-scale international events.", "AI": {"tldr": "Transformer \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uad6d\uc81c \ud589\uc0ac\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ucc38\uc11d \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uad6d\uc81c \ud589\uc0ac\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uad00\uc911 \ud750\ub984 \ubc0f \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uad00\ub9ac\uc640 \uad00\ub828\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc77c\uc77c \ucc38\uc11d \uc608\uce21\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc608\uc57d \ub3d9\uc801 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ucc38\uac00 \uc758\ub3c4\ub97c \ucd94\uc815\ud558\ub294 Transformer \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub3d9\ucabd\uacfc \uc11c\ucabd \uac8c\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud560 \ub54c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uac00 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub428\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc608\uc57d \ub3d9\uc801 \uc815\ubcf4\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uad6d\uc81c \ud589\uc0ac\uc5d0\uc11c \ucc38\uc11d \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc720\uc775\ud55c \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc77c\uc77c \ucc38\uc11d \uc608\uce21\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc740 \uc77c\ubcf8 \uc624\uc0ac\uce74, \uac04\uc0ac\uc774\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5f4\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5d1\uc2a4\ud3ec 2025\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uad6d\uc81c \ud589\uc0ac\uc5d0\uc11c \uad50\ud1b5, \uad70\uc911 \ud750\ub984 \ubc0f \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uad00\ub9ac\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub2e4\uc911 \ucd9c\ucc98 \uc678\ubd80 \ub370\uc774\ud130(\uc608: \ub0a0\uc528, \uad50\ud1b5, \uc18c\uc15c \ubbf8\ub514\uc5b4)\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\ubbc0\ub85c \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \ucda9\ubd84\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc744 \uacbd\uc6b0 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc608\uc57d \ub3d9\uc801(\uc989, \uc2dc\uac04 \ucc3d \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud2f0\ucf13 \uc608\uc57d \ubc0f \uc774\ud6c4 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8)\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ucc38\uc11d \uc758\ub3c4\ub97c \ucd94\uc815\ud558\ub294 Transformer \uae30\ubc18 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc758\ub3c4\ub294 \uacb0\uad6d \uc608\uc57d \ud328\ud134\uc5d0 \ubc18\uc601\ub41c\ub2e4\uace0 \uac00\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc124\uacc4\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ucd9c\ucc98 \ud1b5\ud569\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \ud53c\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc608\uc57d \ub3d9\uc801\uc5d0 \uc554\ubb35\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub0b4\uc7ac\ub41c \ub0a0\uc528\uc640 \ud504\ub85c\ubaa8\uc158\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc678\ubd80 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc785\uc7a5 \uae30\ub85d\uacfc \uc608\uc57d \ub3d9\uc801\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uace0 \ub2e8\uc77c \ucc44\ub110(\ucd1d \ucc38\uc11d) \ubc0f \uc774\uc911 \ucc44\ub110(\ub3d9\uc11c \uac8c\uc774\ud2b8 \uad6c\ubd84) \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4. \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ub3d9\uc11c \uac8c\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \ubcc4\ub3c4\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud560 \ub54c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uac00 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \ud2b9\ud788 \ub2e8\uae30 \ubc0f \uc911\uae30 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0\uc11c \uadf8\ub807\ub2e4. \uc81c\uac70 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc778\ucf54\ub354-\ub514\ucf54\ub354 \uad6c\uc870, \uc5ed\ubc29\ud5a5 \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c \uc784\ubca0\ub529 \ubc0f \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc735\ud569 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \ucd94\uac00\ub85c \ud655\uc778\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc804\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc1c\uacac\uc740 \uc608\uc57d \ub3d9\uc801\uc774 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uad6d\uc81c \ud589\uc0ac\uc5d0\uc11c \ucc38\uc11d \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc720\uc775\ud55c \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud568\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b8\ub2e4."}}

The lack of a clear definition in managing shared and protected access to IoT sensors offer channels by which devices can be compromised and sensitive data can be leaked. In recent years, WebAssembly has received considerable attention for its efficient application sandboxing suitable for embedded systems, making it a prime candidate for exploring a secure and portable sensor interface. This paper introduces the first WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) extension offering a secure, portable, and low-footprint sandbox enabling multi-tenant access to sensor data across heterogeneous embedded devices. The runtime extensions provide application memory isolation, ensure appropriate resource privileges by intercepting sensor access, and offer an MQTT-SN interface enabling in-network access control. When targeting the WebAssembly byte-code with the associated runtime extensions implemented atop the Zephyr RTOS, our evaluation of sensor access indicates a latency overhead of 6% with an additional memory footprint of 5% when compared to native execution.

This work investigates how to quantify and mitigate abstraction errors by leveraging medical taxonomies. We benchmark several state-of-the-art VLMs using hierarchical metrics and introduce Catastrophic Abstraction Errors to capture cross-branch mistakes. Our results reveal substantial misalignment of VLMs with clinical taxonomies despite high flat performance. To address this, we propose risk-constrained thresholding and taxonomy-aware fine-tuning with radial embeddings, which reduce severe abstraction errors to below 2 per cent while maintaining competitive performance. These findings highlight the importance of hierarchical evaluation and representation-level alignment for safer and more clinically meaningful deployment of VLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uccb4\uc678 X-\ub808\uc774 \ubd84\ub958\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ube44\uc804-\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uc644\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 \uc9c0\ud45c\uac00 \uc784\uc0c1\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubbf8\uc138\ud55c \uc624\ub958\uc640 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \uc624\ub958\ub97c \uad6c\ubcc4\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0.", "method": "\uc758\ub8cc \ubd84\ub958 \uccb4\uacc4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc624\ub958\ub97c \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\uace0, \uc5ec\ub7ec \ucd5c\uc2e0\uc758 \ube44\uc804-\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(VLM)\uc744 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud0b9\ud558\uba70, Catastrophic Abstraction Errors \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud574 \uad50\ucc28 \ubd84\uae30 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29.", "result": "\ube44\ub85d \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ub192\uc544 \ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc VLM\uacfc \uc784\uc0c1 \ubd84\ub958 \uccb4\uacc4 \uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\uac00 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0a8.", "conclusion": "\uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ud3c9\uac00\uc640 \ud45c\ud604 \uc218\uc900 \uc815\ub82c\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70, \uc548\uc804\ud558\uace0 \uc784\uc0c1\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc758\ubbf8 \uc788\ub294 VLM \ubc30\uce58\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548.", "translated_summary": "\ube44\uc804-\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ud749\ubd80 X-\ub808\uc774 \ubd84\ub958\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud3c9\uba74 \uc9c0\ud45c\ub294 \uc784\uc0c1\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubbf8\uc138\ud55c \uc624\ub958\uc640 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \uc624\ub958\ub97c \uad6c\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc2e4\ud328\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc758\ub8cc \ubd84\ub958 \uccb4\uacc4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ucd94\uc0c1 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uc644\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc9c0\ud45c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc5ec\ub7ec \ucd5c\uc2e0 VLM\uc744 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud0b9\ud558\uace0, \uad50\ucc28 \ubd84\uae30 \uc2e4\uc218\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 Catastrophic Abstraction Errors\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ub192\uc740 \ud3c9\uba74 \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 VLM\uacfc \uc784\uc0c1 \ubd84\ub958 \uccb4\uacc4 \uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub97c \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc704\ud5d8 \uc81c\uc57d \uae30\ubc18 \uc784\uacc4\uac12 \uc124\uc815\uacfc \ubc29\uc0ac\ud615 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c \ubd84\ub958 \uccb4\uacc4 \uc778\uc2dd \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \ucd94\uc0c1 \uc624\ub958\ub97c 2% \uc774\ud558\ub85c \uc904\uc774\uba74\uc11c \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc1c\uacac\uc740 \ub354 \uc548\uc804\ud558\uace0 \uc784\uc0c1\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc758\ubbf8 \uc788\ub294 VLM \ubc30\ud3ec\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ud3c9\uac00\uc640 \ud45c\ud604 \uc218\uc900 \uc815\ub82c\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

While single-agent systems remain limited in adaptability and coordination, recent progress has shifted attention toward multi-agent systems (MAS) composed of interacting LLMs that pursue cooperative, competitive, or mixed objectives. This emerging paradigm provides a powerful testbed for studying social dynamics and strategic behaviors among intelligent agents. However, current research remains fragmented and lacks a unifying theoretical foundation. To address this gap, we present a comprehensive survey of LLM-based multi-agent systems through a game-theoretic lens. By organizing existing studies around the four key elements of game theory: players, strategies, payoffs, and information, we establish a systematic framework for understanding, comparing, and guiding future research on the design and analysis of LLM-based MAS.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \uc870\uc0ac\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0, \uac8c\uc784 \uc774\ub860\uc758 \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud575\uc2ec \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc124\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM\uc774 \uac1c\ubcc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc801\uc751\uc131\uacfc \uc870\uc815\ub825\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \ubc18\uba74, LLM \uac04 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud611\ub825\uc801, \uacbd\uc7c1\uc801 \ub610\ub294 \ud63c\ud569 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ucd94\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad00\uc2ec\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uac8c\uc784 \uc774\ub860\uc758 \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud575\uc2ec \uc694\uc18c(\ud50c\ub808\uc774\uc5b4, \uc804\ub7b5, \ubcf4\uc0c1, \uc815\ubcf4)\ub97c \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c \uae30\uc874 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc870\uc9c1\ud558\uc5ec LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc9c0\ub2a5\ud615 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559 \ubc0f \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \ube44\uad50\ud558\uace0 \uc124\uacc4 \ubc0f \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc548\ub0b4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ud604\uc7ac \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \ud30c\ud3b8\ud654\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud1b5\ud569\ub41c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ucd94\ub860, \uacc4\ud68d \ubc0f \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ucf00\uc774\uc158 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70 \uc5f4\ub9b0 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \uc791\ub3d9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc801\uc751\uc131 \ubc0f \uc870\uc815\ub825\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ucd5c\uadfc\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \ud611\ub825\uc801, \uacbd\uc7c1\uc801 \ub610\ub294 \ud63c\ud569 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ucd94\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc791\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 LLM\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(MAS)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad00\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\ub3d9\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc740 \uc9c0\ub2a5\ud615 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559 \ubc0f \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc2dc\ud5d8\ub300\uac00 \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ud604\uc7ac \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ud30c\ud3b8\ud654\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc73c\uba70 \ud1b5\ud569\ub41c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uae30\ucd08\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac8c\uc784 \uc774\ub860\uc758 \uad00\uc810\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \uc870\uc0ac\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uac8c\uc784 \uc774\ub860\uc758 \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud575\uc2ec \uc694\uc18c\uc778 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\uc5b4, \uc804\ub7b5, \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubc0f \uc815\ubcf4 \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\ub9ac\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368, LLM \uae30\ubc18 MAS\uc758 \uc124\uacc4 \ubc0f \ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc774\ud574, \ube44\uad50 \ubc0f \ubbf8\ub798 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc548\ub0b4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Most existing search-based symbolic regression methods typically rely on the fitting error to inform the search process. However, in the vast expression space, numerous candidate expressions may exhibit similar error values while differing substantially in structure, leading to ambiguous search directions and hindering convergence to the underlying true function. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework named EGRL-SR (Experience-driven Goal-conditioned Reinforcement Learning for Symbolic Regression). In contrast to traditional error-driven approaches, EGRL-SR introduces a new perspective: leveraging precise historical trajectories and optimizing the action-value network to proactively guide the search process, thereby achieving a more robust expression search. Specifically, we formulate symbolic regression as a goal-conditioned reinforcement learning problem and incorporate hindsight experience replay, allowing the action-value network to generalize common mapping patterns from diverse input-output pairs. Moreover, we design an all-point satisfaction binary reward function that encourages the action-value network to focus on structural patterns rather than low-error expressions, and concurrently propose a structure-guided heuristic exploration strategy to enhance search diversity and space coverage. Experiments on public benchmarks show that EGRL-SR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recovery rate and robustness, and can recover more complex expressions under the same search budget. Ablation results validate that the action-value network effectively guides the search, with both the reward function and the exploration strategy playing critical roles.", "AI": {"tldr":

Modern cloud-native DDoS attacks further evolve rapidly and often blend multi-vector strategies, creating an operational dilemma: defenders need wire-speed monitoring while also requiring explainable, auditable attribution for response. Existing rule-based and supervised-learning approaches typically output black-box scores or labels, provide limited evidence chains, and generalize poorly to unseen attack variants; meanwhile, high-quality labeled data is often difficult to obtain in cloud settings.\n  We present Holmes (DDoS Detective), an LLM-based DDoS detection agent that reframes the model as a virtual SRE investigator rather than an end-to-end classifier. Holmes couples a funnel-like hierarchical workflow (counters/sFlow for continuous sensing and triage; PCAP evidence collection triggered only on anomaly windows) with an Evidence Pack abstraction that converts binary packets into compact, reproducible, high-signal structured evidence. On top of this evidence interface, Holmes enforces a structure-first investigation protocol and strict JSON/quotation constraints to produce machine-consumable reports with auditable evidence anchors.\n  We evaluate Holmes on CICDDoS2019 reflection/amplification attacks and script-triggered flooding scenarios. Results show that Holmes produces attribution decisions grounded in salient evidence anchors across diverse attack families, and when errors occur, its audit logs make the failure source easy to localize, demonstrating the practicality of an LLM agent for cost-controlled and traceable DDoS investigation in cloud operations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Holmes\ub294 \ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c DDoS \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \ub300\uc751\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c LLM \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubc29\uc2dd\uacfc \ub2ec\ub9ac \uac00\uc2dc\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uad6c\uc870\uc801\uc778 \uc99d\uac70\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc \ud658\uacbd\uc740 \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uc911\uc2dd \uc790\uc6d0\uacfc \ub113\uc740 \uacf5\uaca9 \ud45c\uba74\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ube48\ubc88\ud55c DDoS \uc704\ud611\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ud604\ub300 \ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc \ub124\uc774\ud2f0\ube0c DDoS \uacf5\uaca9\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubca1\ud130 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ud63c\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ubc29\uc5b4\uc790\ub4e4\uc5d0\uac8c \uc2e0\uc18d\ud55c \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\uacfc \uc124\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uadc0\uc18d\uc131\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \uc6b4\uc601\uc0c1\uc758 \ub51c\ub808\ub9c8\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "Holmes\ub294 \uac00\uc0c1 SRE \uc870\uc0ac\uad00\uc73c\ub85c\uc11c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uc5f0\uc18d \uac10\uc9c0 \ubc0f \ubd84\ub958\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\uc640 \uc774\uc9c4 \ud328\ud0b7\uc744 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc99d\uac70\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub294 \uc99d\uac70 \ud329 \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "Holmes\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uacf5\uaca9 \ud328\ubc00\ub9ac\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc99d\uac70\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uadc0\uc18d \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uc624\ub958 \ubc1c\uc0dd \uc2dc \uac10\uc0ac \ub85c\uadf8\uac00 \uc2e4\ud328\uc758 \ucd9c\ucc98\ub97c \uc27d\uac8c \ucc3e\uc544\ub0bc \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ub3d5\ub294\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Holmes\ub294 \ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc \uc6b4\uc601\uc5d0\uc11c \ube44\uc6a9 \ud1b5\uc81c \ubc0f \ucd94\uc801 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c DDoS \uc870\uc0ac\ub97c \uc704\ud55c LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc \ud658\uacbd\uc740 \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uc911\uc2dd \uc790\uc6d0\uacfc \ub113\uc740 \uacf5\uaca9 \ud45c\uba74\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ube48\ubc88\ud55c DDoS \uc704\ud611\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ud604\ub300 \ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc \ub124\uc774\ud2f0\ube0c DDoS \uacf5\uaca9\uc740 \ube60\ub974\uac8c \uc9c4\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uc885\uc885 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubca1\ud130 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ud63c\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ubc29\uc5b4\uc790\uc5d0\uac8c \uc640\uc774\uc5b4 \uc18d\ub3c4 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\uacfc \uc124\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uac10\uc0ac\uc801 \uadc0\uc18d\uc131\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \uc6b4\uc601\uc0c1\uc758 \ub51c\ub808\ub9c8\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uaddc\uce59 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc0f \uc9c0\ub3c4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 \uc810\uc218\ub098 \ub808\uc774\ube14\uc744 \ucd9c\ub825\ud558\uace0 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc99d\uac70 \uccb4\uc778\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \ubcf4\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c \uacf5\uaca9 \ubcc0\ud615\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\uac00 \ubd88\ub7c9\ud558\ub2e4. \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0, \ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \ub808\uc774\ube14 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud655\ubcf4\uac00 \uc885\uc885 \uc5b4\ub835\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18 DDoS \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc778 Holmes(DDoS Detective)\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc5d4\ub4dc\ud22c\uc5d4\ub4dc \ubd84\ub958\uae30\uac00 \uc544\ub2cc \uac00\uc0c1 SRE \uc870\uc0ac\uad00\uc73c\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

The transitions between these behaviors offer valuable insights into user-item interactions, serving as a key signal for understanding evolving preferences. Consequently, there is growing interest in leveraging multi-behavior data to better capture user intent. Recent studies have explored sequential modeling of multi-behavior data, many relying on transformer-based architectures with polynomial time complexity. While effective, these approaches often incur high computational costs, limiting their applicability in large-scale industrial systems with long user sequences. To address this challenge, we propose the Transition-Aware Graph Attention Network (TGA), a linear-complexity approach for modeling multi-behavior transitions. Unlike traditional transformers that treat all behavior pairs equally, TGA constructs a structured sparse graph by identifying informative transitions from three perspectives: (a) item-level transitions, (b) category-level transitions, and (c) neighbor-level transitions. Built upon the structured graph, TGA employs a transition-aware graph Attention mechanism that jointly models user-item interactions and behavior transition types, enabling more accurate capture of sequential patterns while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments show that TGA outperforms all state-of-the-art models while significantly reducing computational cost.

While existing frameworks characterize agents through demographic attributes, personality traits, and interests, they lack mechanisms to encode behavioral dispositions toward platform actions, causing agents to exhibit homogeneous engagement patterns rather than the differentiated participation styles observed on real platforms. In this paper, we investigate the role of behavioral traits as an explicit characterization layer to regulate agents' propensities across posting, re-sharing, commenting, reacting, and inactivity. Through large-scale simulations involving 980 agents and validation against real-world social media data, we demonstrate that behavioral traits are essential to sustain heterogeneous, profile-consistent participation patterns and enable realistic content propagation dynamics through the interplay of amplification- and interaction-oriented profiles.

Prototype-based FL mitigates this issue by exchanging class-wise feature prototypes instead of full model parameters; however, existing methods still suffer from suboptimal generalization under severe communication constraints. In this paper, we propose RefProtoFL, a communication-efficient FL framework that integrates External-Referenced Prototype Alignment (ERPA) for representation consistency with Adaptive Probabilistic Update Dropping (APUD) for communication efficiency. Specifically, we decompose the model into a private backbone and a lightweight shared adapter, and restrict federated communication to the adapter parameters only. To further reduce uplink cost, APUD performs magnitude-aware Top-K sparsification, transmitting only the most significant adapter updates for server-side aggregation. To address representation inconsistency across heterogeneous clients, ERPA leverages a small server-held public dataset to construct external reference prototypes that serve as shared semantic anchors. For classes covered by public data, clients directly align local representations to public-induced prototypes, whereas for uncovered classes, alignment relies on server-aggregated global reference prototypes via weighted averaging.

Whaling is a form of social engineering that targets important high-authority individuals within organizations and uses sophisticated fraudulent emails. In the context of Japanese universities, faculty members frequently hold positions that combine research leadership with authority within institutional workflows. This structural characteristic leads to the wide public disclosure of high-value information such as publications, grants, and detailed researcher profiles. Such extensive information exposure enables the construction of highly precise target profiles using generative AI. This raises concerns that Whaling attacks based on high-precision profiling by generative AI will become prevalent. In this study, we propose a Whaling countermeasure framework for university faculty members that constructs personalized defense profiles and uses large language model (LLM)-based agents. We design agents that (i) build vulnerability profiles for each target from publicly available information on faculty members, (ii) identify potential risk scenarios relevant to Whaling defense based on those profiles, (iii) construct defense profiles corresponding to the vulnerabilities and anticipated risks, and (iv) analyze Whaling emails using the defense profiles. Furthermore, we conduct a preliminary risk-assessment experiment.

This position is affected by unexamined onto-epistemological assumptions: meaning is treated as immanent to the model, the explainer is positioned outside the system, and a causal structure is presumed recoverable through computational techniques. In this paper, we draw on Barad's agential realism to develop an alternative onto-epistemology of XAI. We propose that interpretations are material-discursive performances that emerge from situated entanglements of the AI model with humans, context, and the interpretative apparatus. To develop this position, we read a comprehensive set of XAI methods through agential realism and reveal the assumptions and limitations that underpin several of these methods. We then articulate the framework's ethical dimension and propose design directions for XAI interfaces that support emergent interpretation, using a speculative text-to-music interface as a case study.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc124\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c AI(XAI)\uc758 \uc874\uc7ac\ub860\uc801-\uc778\uc2dd\ub860\uc801 \uac00\uc815\uc744 \ube44\ud310\ud558\uace0, \ub300\uc548\uc801\uc778 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c\uc11c \ubc14\ub77c\ub4dc\uc758 \ud589\uc704\ub860\uc801 \uc0ac\uc2e4\uc8fc\uc758\ub97c \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec AI \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uc778\uac04, \ub9e5\ub77d, \ud574\uc11d \ub3c4\uad6c \uac04\uc758 \uc5bd\ud798\uc5d0\uc11c \ub098\ud0c0\ub098\ub294 \ud574\uc11d\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "XAI\ub97c \uae30\uc220\uc801 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub8e8\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \uad00\uc810\uc744 \ube44\ud310\ud558\uace0 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc874\uc7ac\ub860\uc801-\uc778\uc2dd\ub860\uc801 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "Barad\uc758 \ud589\uc704\ub860\uc801 \uc0ac\uc2e4\uc8fc\uc758\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uc5ec XAI \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0, \ud574\uc11d\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \ub9e5\ub77d\uacfc \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uc911\uc810\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud0d0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc5ec\ub7ec XAI \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \uac00\uc815\uacfc \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b4\uace0, \uc724\ub9ac\uc801 \ucc28\uc6d0\uacfc \ud568\uaed8 emergent interpretation\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 XAI \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\uc758 \uc124\uacc4 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "XAI \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4 \uc124\uacc4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc81c\uc548\uc740 \ud589\uc704\ub860\uc801 \uc0ac\uc2e4\uc8fc\uc758\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud574\uc11d\uc758 \uacfc\uc815\uc774 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ub2ec\ub77c\uc9c8 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc124\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c AI(XAI)\ub294 AI \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ub0b4\ubd80 \uc791\ub3d9\uc744 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b4\ub294 \uae30\uc220\uc801 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc790\uc8fc \uc778\uc2dd\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc785\uc7a5\uc740 \uac80\ud1a0\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uc874\uc7ac\ub860\uc801-\uc778\uc2dd\ub860\uc801 \uac00\uc815\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubc1b\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uc758\ubbf8\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub0b4\uc7ac\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub904\uc9c0\uace0, \uc124\uba85\uc790\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc678\ubd80\uc5d0 \uc704\uce58\ud558\uba70, \uc778\uacfc \uad6c\uc870\ub294 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubcf5\uad6c \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \uac00\uc815\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubc14\ub77c\ub4dc\uc758 \ud589\uc704\ub860\uc801 \uc0ac\uc2e4\uc8fc\uc758\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c XAI\uc758 \ub300\uc548\uc801 \uc874\uc7ac\ub860\uc801-\uc778\uc2dd\ub860\uc744 \ubc1c\uc804\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud574\uc11d\uc774 AI \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uc778\uac04, \ub9e5\ub77d, \ud574\uc11d \ub3c4\uad6c\uc758 \uc5bd\ud798\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \ubb3c\uc9c8\uc801\uc778-\ub2f4\ud654\uc801 \uc218\ud589\uc784\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc785\uc7a5\uc744 \ubc1c\uc804\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 XAI \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \ud589\uc704\ub860\uc801 \uc0ac\uc2e4\uc8fc\uc758\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc5d0 \ub4b7\ubc1b\uce68\ub418\ub294 \uac00\uc815\uacfc \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7f0 \ub2e4\uc74c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \uc724\ub9ac\uc801 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud558\uace0, \uc0ac\ubcc0\uc801 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8-\uc74c\uc545 \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\ub97c \uc0ac\ub840 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec emergent interpretation\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 XAI \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4 \uc124\uacc4 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Extending these methods to continuous features remains substantially more challenging due to the large number of potential splits for each feature. Recently, an elegant exact algorithm was proposed for learning optimal decision trees with continuous features; however, the rapidly increasing computational time limits its practical applicability to shallow depths (typically 3 or 4). It relies on a depth-first search optimization strategy that fully optimizes the left subtree of each split before exploring the corresponding right subtree. While effective in finding optimal solutions given sufficient time, this strategy can lead to poor anytime behavior: when interrupted early, the best-found tree is often highly unbalanced and suboptimal. In such cases, purely greedy methods such as C4.5 may, paradoxically, yield better solutions. To address this limitation, we propose an anytime, yet complete approach leveraging limited discrepancy search, distributing the computational effort more evenly across the entire tree structure, and thus ensuring that a high-quality decision tree is available at any interruption point.

Second, Cybersecurity AI (CAI, 2025) demonstrated automated expert-level performance, operating 3,600x faster than humans while reducing costs 156-fold, validated through #1 rankings at international competitions including the $50,000 Neurogrid CTF prize. Third, Generative Cut-the-Rope (G-CTR, 2026) introduces a neurosymbolic architecture embedding game-theoretic reasoning into LLM-based agents: symbolic equilibrium computation augments neural inference, doubling success rates while reducing behavioral variance 5.2x and achieving 2:1 advantage over non-strategic AI in Attack & Defense scenarios.\n  Together, these advances establish a clear progression from AI-guided humans to human-guided game-theoretic cybersecurity superintelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548 \ucd08\uc9c0\ub2a5\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \ubb38\uc11c\ud654\ud558\uba70, \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \uae30\uc5ec\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 AI \ubcf4\uc548 \ubd84\uc57c\ub97c \uc120\ub3c4\ud55c \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc0ac\ub840\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548\uc758 \ub2e4\uc74c \uacbd\uacc4\ub294 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5\uc774 \ucd5c\uace0\uc758 \uc778\uac04 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\ub294 \ucd08\uc9c0\ub2a5\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "PentestGPT, Cybersecurity AI, Generative Cut-the-Rope\uc758 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud601\uc2e0 \uae30\uc220\uc774 \uc81c\uc2dc\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uac01 \uae30\uc220\uc740 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud604\uc800\ud55c \uac1c\uc120 \ubc0f \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc548\ub0b4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uac8c\uc784 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548 \ucd08\uc9c0\ub2a5\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\uc544\uac00\ub294 \uba85\ud655\ud55c \ubc1c\uc804 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc124\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548 \ucd08\uc9c0\ub2a5\uc740 \uc18d\ub3c4\uc640 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uace0\uc758 \uc778\uac04 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\ub294 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5\uc744 \uc758\ubbf8\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ubcf4\uc548 \ubd84\uc57c\uc758 \ub2e4\uc74c \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 AI \ubcf4\uc548 \ubd84\uc57c\uc758 \uc120\uad6c\uc801\uc778 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \uae30\uc5ec\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub2a5\ub825\uc758 \ucd9c\ud604\uc744 \ubb38\uc11c\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uccab\uc9f8, PentestGPT(2023)\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uce68\ud22c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf4\uc548 \uc804\ubb38 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uc548\ub0b4\ub85c \uc678\ubd80\ud654\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uae30\uc900 \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 228.6% \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub458\uc9f8, Cybersecurity AI(CAI, 2025)\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5b4 \uc778\uac04\ubcf4\ub2e4 3,600\ubc30 \ube60\ub974\uace0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 156\ubc30 \uc904\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 50,000\ub2ec\ub7ec Neurogrid CTF \uc0c1\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uad6d\uc81c \ub300\ud68c\uc5d0\uc11c 1\uc704\ub85c \uac80\uc99d\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc14b\uc9f8, Generative Cut-the-Rope(G-CTR, 2026)\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \uac8c\uc784 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ub0b4\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \uc2e0\uacbd \uae30\ud638 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \uae30\ud638 \uade0\ud615 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc774 \uc2e0\uacbd \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ubcf4\uac15\ud558\uc5ec \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \ub450 \ubc30\ub85c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \ud589\ub3d9 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc744 5.2\ubc30 \uc904\uc774\ub294 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uacf5\uaca9 \ubc0f \ubc29\uc5b4 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \ube44\uc804\ub7b5\uc801 AI\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 2:1\uc758 \uc774\uc810\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 AI\uac00 \uc548\ub0b4\ud558\ub294 \uc778\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uac04\uc774 \uc548\ub0b4\ud558\ub294 \uac8c\uc784 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548 \ucd08\uc9c0\ub2a5\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \uba85\ud655\ud55c \ubc1c\uc804 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \ud655\ub9bd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Decisions are executed through formally correct approval processes, yet no entity possesses both the authority to approve those decisions and the epistemic capacity to meaningfully understand their basis.\n  We define this condition as responsibility vacuum: a state in which decisions occur, but responsibility cannot be attributed because authority and verification capacity do not coincide. We show that this is not a process deviation or technical defect, but a structural property of deployments where decision generation throughput exceeds bounded human verification capacity.\n  We identify a scaling limit under standard deployment assumptions, including parallel agent generation, CI-based validation, and individualized human approval gates. Beyond a throughput threshold, verification ceases to function as a decision criterion and is replaced by ritualized approval based on proxy signals. Personalized responsibility becomes structurally unattainable in this regime.\n  We further characterize a CI amplification dynamic, whereby increasing automated validation coverage raises proxy signal density without restoring human capacity. Under fixed time and attention constraints, this accelerates cognitive offloading in the broad sense and widens the gap between formal approval and epistemic understanding. Additional automation therefore amplifies, rather than mitigates, the responsibility vacuum.\n  We conclude that unless organizations explicitly redesign decision boundaries or reassign responsibility away from individual decisions toward batch- or system-level ownership, responsibility vacuum remains an invisible but persistent failure mode in scaled agent deployments.", "AI": {"tldr":

This paper introduces a reflection-in-reflection framework for automated generation of reflection questions with large language models (LLMs). Our approach coordinates two role-specialized agents, a Student-Teacher and a Teacher-Educator, that engage in a Socratic multi-turn dialogue to iteratively refine a single question given a teacher-specified topic, key concepts, student level, and optional instructional materials. The Student-Teacher proposes candidate questions with brief rationales, while the Teacher-Educator evaluates them along clarity, depth, relevance, engagement, and conceptual interconnections, responding only with targeted coaching questions or a fixed signal to stop the dialogue. We evaluate the framework in an authentic lower-secondary ICT setting on the topic, using GPT-4o-mini as the backbone model and a stronger GPT- 4-class LLM as an external evaluator in pairwise comparisons of clarity, relevance, depth, and overall quality. First, we study how interaction design and context (dynamic vs.fixed iteration counts; presence or absence of student level and materials) affect question quality. Dynamic stopping combined with contextual information consistently outperforms fixed 5- or 10-step refinement, with very long dialogues prone to drift or over-complication.

Indeed, existing defenses rely on LLM-mediated checking stages that add substantial latency and cost, and that can be undermined in multi-turn interactions through manipulation or benign-looking conversational scaffolding. Contrasting this background, this paper makes a key observation: internal representations associated with privacy-violating intent can be separated from benign requests using linear structure. Using this insight, the paper proposes NeuroFilter, a guardrail framework that operationalizes contextual integrity by mapping norm violations to simple directions in the model's activation space, enabling detection even when semantic filters are bypassed. The proposed filter is also extended to capture threats arising during long conversations using the concept of activation velocity, which measures cumulative drift in internal representations across turns. A comprehensive evaluation across over 150,000 interactions and covering models from 7B to 70B parameters, illustrates the strong performance of NeuroFilter in detecting privacy attacks while maintaining zero false positives on benign prompts, all while reducing the computational inference cost by several orders of magnitude when compared to LLM-based agentic privacy defenses.", "AI":

As these systems become more autonomous and are deployed at scale, understanding why an agent takes a particular action becomes increasingly important for accountability and governance. However, existing research predominantly focuses on \\textit{failure attribution} to localize explicit errors in unsuccessful trajectories, which is insufficient for explaining the reasoning behind agent behaviors. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework for \\textbf{general agentic attribution}, designed to identify the internal factors driving agent actions regardless of the task outcome. Our framework operates hierarchically to manage the complexity of agent interactions. Specifically, at the \\textit{component level}, we employ temporal likelihood dynamics to identify critical interaction steps; then at the \\textit{sentence level}, we refine this localization using perturbation-based analysis to isolate the specific textual evidence. We validate our framework across a diverse suite of agentic scenarios, including standard tool use and subtle reliability risks like memory-induced bias. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework reliably pinpoints pivotal historical events and sentences behind the agent behavior, offering a critical step toward safer and more accountable agentic systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc774\uc720\ub97c

With the growing adoption of wearable glucose monitors and mobile health applications, accurate blood glucose prediction is essential for enhancing automated insulin delivery and decision-support systems. This paper presents a deep learning-based approach for personalized blood glucose prediction, leveraging patient-specific data to improve prediction accuracy and responsiveness in real-world scenarios. Unlike traditional generalized models, our method accounts for individual variability, enabling more effective subject-specific predictions. We compare Leave-One-Subject-Out Cross-Validation with a fine-tuning strategy to evaluate their ability to model patient-specific dynamics. Results show that personalized models significantly improve the prediction of adverse events, enabling more precise and timely interventions in real-world scenarios. To assess the impact of patient-specific data, we conduct experiments comparing a multimodal, patient-specific approach against traditional CGM-only methods. Additionally, we perform an ablation study to investigate model performance with progressively smaller training sets, identifying the minimum data required for effective personalization-an essential consideration for real-world applications where extensive data collection is often challenging. Our findings underscore the potential of adaptive, personalized glucose prediction models for advancing next-generation diabetes management, particularly in wearable and mobile health platforms,

This threat is necessitating a transition to quantum resistant cryptographic alternatives in all the applications. In this work, we present the implementation of a practical hybrid end-to-end encryption system that combines classical and post-quantum cryptographic primitives to achieve both security and efficiency. Our system employs CRYSTALS-Kyber, a NIST-standardized lattice-based key encapsulation mechanism, for quantum-safe key exchange, coupled with AES-256-GCM for efficient authenticated symmetric encryption and SHA-256 for deterministic key derivation. The architecture follows a zero-trust model where a relay server facilitates communication without accessing plaintext messages or cryptographic keys. All encryption and decryption operations occur exclusively at client endpoints. The system demonstrates that NIST standardized post-quantum cryptography can be effectively integrated into practical messaging systems with acceptable performance characteristics, offering protection against both classical and quantum adversaries. As our focus is on implementation rather than on novelty, we also provide an open-source implementation to facilitate reproducibility and further research in post quantum secure communication systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc591\uc790 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305\uc758 \ub4f1\uc7a5\uc73c\ub85c \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uacf5\uac1c \ud0a4 \uc554\ud638 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uc704\ud611\ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub300\uc548\uc73c\ub85c \ud63c\ud569\ud615 \uc885\ub2e8 \uac04 \uc554\ud638\ud654 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uad6c\ud604\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc591\uc790 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305\uc758 \ucd9c\ud604\uc740 \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uacf5\uac1c \ud0a4 \uc554\ud638 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uc704\ud611\uc744 \uc81c\uae30\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uace0\uc804 \ubc0f \ud3ec\uc2a4\ud2b8-\uc591\uc790 \uc554\ud638 \ud504\ub9ac\ubbf8\ud2f0\ube0c\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf4\uc548\uc131\uacfc \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc885\ub2e8 \uac04 \uc554\ud638\ud654 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uad6c\ud604\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "NIST \ud45c\uc900\ud654\ub41c \ud3ec\uc2a4\ud2b8-\uc591\uc790 \uc554\ud638\ud654\uac00 \uc2e4\uc81c \uba54\uc2dc\uc9d5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud1b5\ud569\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uace0\uc804 \ubc0f \uc591\uc790 \uc801\ub300 \uc138\ub825\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubcf4\ud638\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub610\ud55c, \uad6c\ud604\uc758 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uc5b4 \uc624\ud508 \uc18c\uc2a4 \uad6c\ud604\uccb4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc5ec \ud3ec\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc591\uc790 \uc548\uc804 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc7ac\ud604\uc131\uacfc \ucd94\uac00 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ucd09\uc9c4\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc591\uc790 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305\uc758 \ucd9c\ud604\uc740 \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uacf5\uac1c \ud0a4 \uc554\ud638 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uc704\ud611\uc744 \uc81c\uae30\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc704\ud611\uc740 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc591\uc790 \uc800\ud56d \uc554\ud638 \ub300\uc548\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \uc804\ud658\uc744 \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubcf4\uc548\uc131\uacfc \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uace0\uc804 \ubc0f \ud3ec\uc2a4\ud2b8-\uc591\uc790 \uc554\ud638 \ud504\ub9ac\ubbf8\ud2f0\ube0c\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc885\ub2e8 \uac04 \uc554\ud638\ud654 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uad6c\ud604\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc591\uc790 \uc548\uc804 \ud0a4 \uad50\ud658\uc744 \uc704\ud574 NIST \ud45c\uc900\ud654\ub41c \uaca9\uc790 \uae30\ubc18 \ud0a4 \ucea1\uc290\ud654 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc778 CRYSTALS-Kyber\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uace0, \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc778\uc99d\ub41c \ub300\uce6d \uc554\ud638\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud574 AES-256-GCM, \uacb0\uc815\ub860\uc801 \ud0a4 \ud30c\uc0dd\uc744 \uc704\ud574 SHA-256\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub294 \ub9b4\ub808\uc774 \uc11c\ubc84\uac00 \ud3c9\ubb38 \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0\ub098 \uc554\ud638\ud654 \ud0a4\uc5d0 \uc811\uadfc\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc744 \uc6a9\uc774\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uc81c\ub85c \ud2b8\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ub530\ub985\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc554\ud638\ud654 \ubc0f \ubcf5\ud638\ud654 \uc791\uc5c5\uc740 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \ub2e8\ub9d0\uc5d0\uc11c\ub9cc \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 NIST \ud45c\uc900\ud654\ub41c \ud3ec\uc2a4\ud2b8-\uc591\uc790 \uc554\ud638\ud654\uac00 \ud5c8\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uba54\uc2dc\uc9d5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud1b5\ud569\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uace0\uc804\uc801 \ubc0f \uc591\uc790\uc801 \uc801\ub300 \uc138\ub825\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubcf4\ud638\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ucd08\uc810\uc740 \ud601\uc2e0\uc774 \uc544\ub2cc \uad6c\ud604\uc5d0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ud3ec\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc591\uc790 \uc548\uc804 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc7ac\ud604\uc131\uacfc \ucd94\uac00 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc624\ud508 \uc18c\uc2a4 \uad6c\ud604\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Beyond obvious failures, the subtle issue of \"intent deviation\" severely hinders reliable evaluation and performance improvement. Existing post-training methods generally leverage either real system samples or virtual data simulated by LLMs. However, the former is costly due to reliance on hand-crafted user requests, while the latter suffers from distribution shift from the real tools in the wild. Additionally, both methods lack negative samples tailored to intent deviation scenarios, hindering effective guidance on preference learning. We introduce RISE, a \"Real-to-Virtual\" method designed to mitigate intent deviation. Anchoring on verified tool primitives, RISE synthesizes virtual trajectories and generates diverse negative samples through mutation on critical parameters. With synthetic data, RISE fine-tunes backbone LLMs via the two-stage training for intent alignment. Evaluation results demonstrate that data synthesized by RISE achieve promising results in eight metrics covering user requires, execution trajectories and agent responses. Integrating with training, RISE achieves an average 35.28% improvement in Acctask (task completion) and 23.27% in Accintent (intent alignment), outperforming SOTA baselines by 1.20--42.09% and 1.17--54.93% respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "RISE\ub294 LLM\uc758 \uc758\ub3c4 \ud3b8\ucc28 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc644\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c 'Real-to-Virtual' \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c, \uac00\uc0c1\uc758 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \ud569\uc131\ud558\uace0 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubd80\uc815 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc5ec LLM\uc744 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLMs\uc758 \uc758\ub3c4 \ud3b8\ucc28 \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uc788\ub294 \ud3c9\uac00\uc640 \uc131\ub2a5 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ubc29\ud574\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "RISE\ub294 \uac80\uc99d\ub41c \ub3c4\uad6c \uc6d0\uc2dc\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uac00\uc0c1 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \ud569\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\uc758 \ubcc0\uacbd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubd80\uc815 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uc758\ub3c4 \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub450 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc758 \uad50\uc721\uc73c\ub85c LLM\uc744 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "RISE\ub85c \ud569\uc131\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub294 8\uac00\uc9c0 \uc9c0\ud45c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc758 \uc694\uad6c, \uc2e4\ud589 \uacbd\ub85c \ubc0f \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "RISE\ub294 Acctask\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uade0 35.28% \uac1c\uc120\uc744, Accintent\uc5d0\uc11c 23.27% \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc5ec SOTA \uae30\uc900\uc744 \uac01\uac01 1.20--42.09% \ubc0f 1.17--54.93% \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "LLM\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \uc774\ub04c\uc5b4\ub0c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc885\uc885 \uc608\uc0c1\uce58 \ubabb\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9\uc774\ub098 \uacb0\uacfc\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc9d1\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uba85\ubc31\ud55c \uc2e4\ud328\ub97c \ub118\uc5b4\uc11c, '\uc758\ub3c4 \ud3b8\ucc28'\uc758 \ubbf8\ubb18\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud3c9\uac00\uc640 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uc2ec\uac01\ud558\uac8c \uc800\ud574\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud6c4 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2e4\uc81c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc0d8\ud50c \ub610\ub294 LLM\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ub41c \uac00\uc0c1 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc804\uc790\ub294 \uc218\uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\uc131\ub41c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc694\uccad\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4e4\uace0, \ud6c4\uc790\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \ub3c4\uad6c\uc758 \ubc30\ud3ec \ubcc0\ud654\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubc1b\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \ub450 \ubc29\ubc95 \ubaa8\ub450 \uc758\ub3c4 \ud3b8\ucc28 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucd98 \ubd80\uc815 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uc5ec \uc120\ud638 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc9c0\ub3c4\ub97c \ubc29\ud574\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc758\ub3c4 \ud3b8\ucc28\ub97c \uc644\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uace0\uc548\ub41c 'Real-to-Virtual' \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 RISE\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac80\uc99d\ub41c \ub3c4\uad6c \uc6d0\uc2dc\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uc5ec RISE\ub294 \uac00\uc0c1 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \ud569\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\uc758 \ubcc0\ud615\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubd80\uc815 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 RISE\ub294 \uc758\ub3c4 \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub450 \ub2e8\uacc4 \uad50\uc721\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc8fc\uc694 LLM\uc744 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud3c9\uac00 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 RISE\uac00 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc758 \uc694\uad6c, \uc2e4\ud589 \uacbd\ub85c \ubc0f \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c 8\uac00\uc9c0 \uc9c0\ud45c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc5bb\uc5c8\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad50\uc721\uacfc \ud1b5\ud569\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 RISE\ub294 Acctask\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uade0 35.28% \uac1c\uc120\uc744, Accintent\uc5d0\uc11c 23.27% \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uac01\uac01 SOTA \uae30\uc900\uc744 1.20--42.09% \ubc0f 1.17--54.93% \ucd08\uacfc\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, designing effective curricula remains a difficult problem, particularly in settings where small subsets of environment parameterisations result in significant increases in the complexity of the required policy. Current methods struggle with a difficult credit assignment problem and rely on regret approximations that fail to identify challenging levels, both of which are compounded as the size of the environment grows. We propose Dynamic Environment Generation for UED (DEGen) to enable a denser level generator reward signal, reducing the difficulty of credit assignment and allowing for UED to scale to larger environment sizes. We also introduce a new regret approximation, Maximised Negative Advantage (MNA), as a significantly improved metric to optimise for, that better identifies more challenging levels. We show empirically that MNA outperforms current regret approximations and when combined with DEGen, consistently outperforms existing methods, especially as the size of the environment grows.

We introduce a unified framework that enables bounded, auditable, and least-privilege delegation across heterogeneous identity ecosystems. The framework includes four key elements: Delegation Grants (DGs), first-class authorization artefacts that encode revocable transfers of authority with enforced scope reduction; a Canonical Verification Context (CVC) that normalizes verification requests into a single structured representation independent of protocols or credential formats; a layered reference architecture that separates trust anchoring, credential and proof validation, policy evaluation, and protocol mediation via a Trust Gateway; and an explicit treatment of blockchain anchoring as an optional integrity layer rather than a structural dependency. Together, these elements advance interoperable delegation and auditability and provide a foundation for future standardization, implementation, and integration of autonomous agents into trusted digital identity infrastructures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uc2e0\uc6d0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc704\uc784 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc911\uc559\uc9d1\uc911\ud615, \uc5f0\ud569\ud615, \uc790\uc8fc\uc801\uc778 \uc2e0\uc6d0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uc801 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc640 \uc790\uc728 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uae30\ubcf8 \uc790\uaca9 \uc99d\uba85\uc774\ub098 \uac1c\uc778 \ud0a4\ub97c \ub178\ucd9c\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uad8c\ud55c\uc744 \ud589\uc0ac\ud558\uace0 \uc774\uc804\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud574\uacb0\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uad8c\ud55c \uc774\uc804\uc744 \uc704\ud55c Delegation Grants(DGs), \uc815\uaddc\ud654\ub41c \uac80\uc99d \uc694\uccad\uc744 \uc704\ud55c Canonical Verification Context(CVC), \uc2e0\ub8b0 \uae30\ubc18 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \ubc0f \ube14\ub85d\uccb4\uc778 \uc575\ucee4\ub9c1\uc744 \uc635\uc158\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 4\uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc6b4\uc601 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc704\uc784 \ubc0f \uac10\uc0ac \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba70 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uc2e0\uc6d0 \uc778\ud504\ub77c\uc5d0 \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uae30\ubc18\uc744 \ub9c8\ub828\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uc2e0\uc6d0 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uad8c\ud55c \uc774\uc804\uc744 \ud1b5\uc81c\ud558\uace0 \uac10\uc0ac \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubc29\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \ud45c\uc900\ud654 \ubc0f \uad6c\ud604\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud560 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc704\uc784\uc740 \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uc911\uc2dd, \uc5f0\ud569 \ud615, \uc790\uc8fc\uc801\uc778 \uc2e0\uc6d0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(SSI) \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ud574\uacb0\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ud2b9\ud788 \uc778\uc801 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc640 \uc790\uc728 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uae30\ubcf8 \uc790\uaca9 \uc99d\uba85\uc774\ub098 \uac1c\uc778 \ud0a4\ub97c \ub178\ucd9c\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uad8c\ud55c\uc744 \ud589\uc0ac\ud558\uace0 \uc774\uc804\ud574\uc57c \ud560 \ub54c \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc2e0\uc6d0 \uc0dd\ud0dc\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c, \uac10\uc0ac \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \ucd5c\uc18c \uad8c\ud55c \uc704\uc784\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 4\uac00\uc9c0 \ud575\uc2ec \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uad8c\ud55c\uc758 \ucde8\uc18c \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc774\uc804\uc744 \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ud55c \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4\uc758 \uad8c\ud55c \ubd80\uc5ec \uc778\uacf5\ubb3c\uc778 Delegation Grants(DG), \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c \ub610\ub294 \uc790\uaca9 \uc99d\uba85 \ud615\uc2dd\uc5d0 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \ub2e8\uc77c \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ud45c\ud604\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\uc99d \uc694\uccad\uc744 \uc815\uaddc\ud654\ud558\ub294 Canonical Verification Context(CVC), \uc2e0\ub8b0 \uac8c\uc774\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2e0\ub8b0 \uace0\uc815, \uc790\uaca9 \uc99d\uba85 \ubc0f \uc99d\uba85 \uac80\uc99d, \uc815\ucc45 \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc0f \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c \uc911\uc7ac\ub97c \uad6c\ubd84\ud558\ub294 \uacc4\uce35\ud654\ub41c \ucc38\uc870 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc774 \uc544\ub2cc \uc120\ud0dd\uc801 \ubb34\uacb0\uc131 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\ub85c\uc11c\uc758 \ube14\ub85d\uccb4\uc778 \uc575\ucee4\ub9c1\uc758 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc778 \ucc98\ub9ac\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc694\uc18c\ub4e4\uc740 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc6b4\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc704\uc784\uacfc \uac10\uc0ac \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc99d\uc9c4\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0, \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uc2e0\uc6d0 \uc778\ud504\ub77c\uc5d0 \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubbf8\ub798\uc758 \ud45c\uc900\ud654, \uad6c\ud604 \ubc0f \ud1b5\ud569\uc758 \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

A Software Engineering Framework", "comment": null, "summary": "Critical domain knowledge typically resides with few experts, creating organizational bottlenecks in scalability and decision-making. Non-experts struggle to create effective visualizations, leading to suboptimal insights and diverting expert time. This paper investigates how to capture and embed human domain knowledge into AI agent systems through an industrial case study. We propose a software engineering framework to capture human domain knowledge for engineering AI agents in simulation data visualization by augmenting a Large Language Model (LLM) with a request classifier, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for code generation, codified expert rules, and visualization design principles unified in an agent demonstrating autonomous, reactive, proactive, and social behavior. Evaluation across five scenarios spanning multiple engineering domains with 12 evaluators demonstrates 206% improvement in output quality, with our agent achieving expert-level ratings in all cases versus baseline's poor performance, while maintaining superior code quality with lower variance. Our contributions are: an automated agent-based system for visualization generation and a validated framework for systematically capturing human domain knowledge and codifying tacit expert knowledge into AI agents, demonstrating that non-experts can achieve expert-level outcomes in specialized domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8

Current AFC benchmarks attempt to address these issues but heavily rely on external computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solvers, are not fully differentiable, and provide limited 3D and multi-agent support. To overcome these limitations, we introduce FluidGym, the first standalone, fully differentiable benchmark suite for RL in AFC. Built entirely in PyTorch on top of the GPU-accelerated PICT solver, FluidGym runs in a single Python stack, requires no external CFD software, and provides standardized evaluation protocols. We present baseline results with PPO and SAC and release all environments, datasets, and trained models as public resources.

Although deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown great potential as an alternative to classical heuristics and exact solvers, existing DRL models often struggle to maintain training stability-failing to converge or generalize when constraints are dense. In this study, we propose a curriculum-based deep reinforcement learning (CB-DRL) framework designed to resolve this instability. The framework utilizes a structured three-phase curriculum that gradually increases problem complexity: the agent first learns distance and fleet optimization (Phase A), then battery management (Phase B), and finally the full EVRPTW (Phase C). To ensure stable learning across phases, the framework employs a modified proximal policy optimization algorithm with phase-specific hyperparameters, value and advantage clipping, and adaptive learning-rate scheduling. The policy network is built upon a heterogeneous graph attention encoder enhanced by global-local attention and feature-wise linear modulation. This specialized architecture explicitly captures the distinct properties of depots, customers, and charging stations. Trained exclusively on small instances with N=10 customers, the model demonstrates robust generalization to unseen instances ranging from N=5 to N=100, significantly outperforming standard baselines on medium-scale problems. Experimental results confirm that this curriculum-guided approach achieves high feasibility rates and competitive solution quality on out-of-distribution instances where standard DRL baselines fail, effectively bridging the gap between neural speed and operational reliability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc804\uae30\ucc28 \uacbd\ub85c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654

Kovalev", "Aleksandr I. Panov"], "title": "Memory Retention Is Not Enough to Master Memory Tasks in Reinforcement Learning", "comment": "11 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables", "summary": "Effective decision-making in the real world depends on memory that is both stable and adaptive: environments change over time, and agents must retain relevant information over long horizons while also updating or overwriting outdated content when circumstances shift. Existing Reinforcement Learning (RL) benchmarks and memory-augmented agents focus primarily on retention, leaving the equally critical ability of memory rewriting largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a benchmark that explicitly tests continual memory updating under partial observability, i.e. the natural setting where an agent must rely on memory rather than current observations, and use it to compare recurrent, transformer-based, and structured memory architectures. Our experiments reveal that classic recurrent models, despite their simplicity, demonstrate greater flexibility and robustness in memory rewriting tasks than modern structured memories, which succeed only under narrow conditions, and transformer-based agents, which often fail beyond trivial retention cases. These findings expose a fundamental limitation of current approaches and emphasize the necessity of memory mechanisms that balance stable retention with adaptive updating. Our work highlights this overlooked challenge, introduces benchmarks to evaluate it, and offers insights for designing future RL agents with explicit and trainable forgetting mechanisms.

To systematically assess this discrepancy, we introduce an interpretable, information-theoretic framework for auditing unlearning using Partial Information Decomposition (PID). By comparing model representations before and after unlearning, we decompose the mutual information with the forgotten data into distinct components, formalizing the notions of unlearned and residual knowledge. Our analysis reveals that redundant information, shared across both models, constitutes residual knowledge that persists post-unlearning and correlates with susceptibility to known adversarial reconstruction attacks.

However, for parameter-constrained models (e.g., 4B--7B), the exploration phase is often plagued by frequent execution failures, creating noisy trajectories that hinder policy optimization. Under standard outcome-based reward settings, this noise leads to a critical credit assignment issue, where erroneous actions are inadvertently reinforced alongside successful outcomes. Existing mitigations face a dilemma: dense rewards often trigger reward hacking, while supersampling incurs prohibitive computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose CLEANER. Distinct from external filtering methods, CLEANER exploits the model's intrinsic self-correction capabilities to eliminate error-contaminated context directly during data collection. At its core, the Similarity-Aware Adaptive Rollback (SAAR) mechanism autonomously constructs clean, purified trajectories by retrospectively replacing failures with successful self-corrections. Based on semantic similarity, SAAR adaptively regulates replacement granularity from shallow execution repairs to deep reasoning substitutions. By training on these self-purified paths, the model internalizes correct reasoning patterns rather than error-recovery loops. Empirical results on AIME24/25, GPQA, and LiveCodeBench show average accuracy gains of 6%, 3%, and 5% over baselines. Notably, CLEANER matches state-of-the-art performance using only one-third of the training steps, highlighting trajectory purification as a scalable solution for efficient agentic RL.
