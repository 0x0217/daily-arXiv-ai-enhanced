Although smaller in scale when compared to historical\nbreaches involving billions of records, Signalgate illustrates critical\nsystemic issues often overshadowed by a focus on external cyber threats.\nEmploying a case-study approach and systematic review grounded in the NIST\nCybersecurity Framework, we analyze the incident to identify patterns of\nhuman-centric vulnerabilities and governance challenges common to\norganizational security failures. Findings emphasize three critical points. (1)\nOrganizational security depends heavily on human behavior, with internal actors\noften serving as the weakest link despite advanced technical defenses; (2)\nLeadership tone strongly influences organizational security culture and\nefficacy, and (3) widespread reliance on technical solutions without sufficient\ninvestments in human and organizational factors leads to ineffective practices\nand wasted resources. From these observations, we propose actionable\nrecommendations for enhancing organizational and national security, including\nstrong leadership engagement, comprehensive adoption of zero-trust\narchitectures, clearer accountability structures, incentivized security\nbehaviors, and rigorous oversight. Particularly during periods of\norganizational transition, such as mergers or large-scale personnel changes,\nadditional measures become particularly important. Signalgate underscores the\nneed for leaders and policymakers to reorient cybersecurity strategies toward\naddressing governance, cultural, and behavioral risks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Signalgate \uc0ac\uac74\uc740 \uc778\uc801 \uc624\ub958\uc640 \uae30\uc220 \ub0a8\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uc870\uc9c1 \ubcf4\uc548\uc758 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b4\uba70, \uc778\uc801 \uc694\uc18c\uc640 \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 Signalgate \uc0ac\uac74\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc870\uc9c1 \ubcf4\uc548\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\uc548 \uac1c\uc120 \ubc29\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "NIST \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uc0ac\ub840 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc640 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801 \uac80\ud1a0 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc0ac\uac74\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uacbd\uc601\uc9c4\uc758 \ucc38\uc5ec, \uc81c\ub85c \ud2b8\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc758 \ucc44\ud0dd, \uba85\ud655\ud55c \ucc45\uc784 \uad6c\uc870 \ub4f1\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub9ac\ub354\uc640 \uc815\ucc45 \uc785\uc548\uc790\ub294 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4, \ubb38\ud654, \ud589\ub3d9 \uc704\ud5d8 \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucdb0 \uc7ac\uc870\uc815\ud574\uc57c \ud568\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "2025\ub144 3\uc6d4\uc758 Signalgate \uc0ac\uac74\uc740 \ubbf8\uad6d \uace0\uc704 \uad6d\uac00 \uc548\ubcf4 \uad00\uacc4\uc790\ub4e4\uc774 \uc554\ud638\ud654\ub41c \uba54\uc2e0\uc800 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc778 Signal\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \uad70\uc0ac \uc791\uc804 \uc138\ubd80 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc6b0\uc5f0\ud788 \uacf5\uac1c\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud55c \uc0ac\uac74\uc73c\ub85c, \uc778\uc801 \uc624\ub958, \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4\uc758 \uacf5\ubc31 \ubc0f \uae30\uc220 \ub0a8\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc870\uc9c1 \ubcf4\uc548\uc758 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\uc2ed\uc5b5 \uac1c\uc758 \uae30\ub85d\uc774 \uc720\ucd9c\ub41c \uc0ac\uac74\ub4e4\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud588\uc744 \ub54c \uaddc\ubaa8\ub294 \ub354 \uc791\uc9c0\ub9cc, Signalgate \uc0ac\uac74\uc740 \uc678\ubd80 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \uc704\ud611\uc5d0\ub9cc \uc9d1\uc911\ud560 \ub54c \uac04\uacfc\ub418\uae30 \uc26c\uc6b4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc801 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc0ac\ub840 \uc5f0\uad6c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uacfc NIST \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801 \uac80\ud1a0\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 \uc0ac\uac74\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0 \uc778\uc801 \uc911\uc2ec \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uacfc \uc870\uc9c1 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc2e4\ud328\uc5d0 \ud754\ud788 \ub098\ud0c0\ub098\ub294 \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4 \ubb38\uc81c\uc758 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5f0\uad6c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8\ub97c \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Leveraging the capabilities of LLMs, malicious users\ncan synthesize phishing emails that are free from spelling mistakes and other\neasily detectable features. Furthermore, such models can generate\ntopic-specific phishing messages, tailoring content to the target domain and\nincreasing the likelihood of success.\n  Detecting such content remains a significant challenge, as LLM-generated\nphishing emails often lack clear or distinguishable linguistic features. As a\nresult, most existing semantic-level detection approaches struggle to identify\nthem reliably. While certain LLM-based detection methods have shown promise,\nthey suffer from high computational costs and are constrained by the\nperformance of the underlying language model, making them impractical for\nlarge-scale deployment.\n  In this work, we aim to address this issue. We propose Paladin, which embeds\ntrigger-tag associations into vanilla LLM using various insertion strategies,\ncreating them into instrumented LLMs. When an instrumented LLM generates\ncontent related to phishing, it will automatically include detectable tags,\nenabling easier identification. Based on the design on implicit and explicit\ntriggers and tags, we consider four distinct scenarios in our work. We evaluate\nour method from three key perspectives: stealthiness, effectiveness, and\nrobustness, and compare it with existing baseline methods. Experimental results\nshow that our method outperforms the baselines, achieving over 90% detection\naccuracy across all scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc545\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131, \ud2b9\ud788 \ud53c\uc2f1 \ucf58\ud150\uce20 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uba70, Paladin\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uac80\ucd9c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc73c\ub85c \ud53c\uc2f1 \uc774\uba54\uc77c\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc545\uc131 \ucf58\ud150\uce20 \uc0dd\uc131\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac80\ucd9c\uc774 \ud070 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "Paladin\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc0bd\uc785 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uae30\ubcf8 LLM\uc5d0 \ud2b8\ub9ac\uac70-\ud0dc\uadf8 \uc5f0\uacc4\ub97c \ub0b4\uc7a5\ud558\uc5ec \ucf58\ud150\uce20 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc2dc \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud0dc\uadf8\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uac1c\ubc1c\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c 90% \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uac80\ucd9c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc545\uc131 \ucf58\ud150\uce20\uc758 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ube60\ub978 \ubc1c\uc804\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ud53c\uc2f1 \ucf58\ud150\uce20 \uc0dd\uc131\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc545\uc758\uc801\uc778 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \uc704\ud611\uc774 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ubcf4\ud3b8\ud654\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc545\uc758\uc801\uc778 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\ub294 LLM\uc758 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub9de\ucda4\ud615 \ud53c\uc2f1 \uc774\uba54\uc77c\uc744 \ud569\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc774\uba54\uc77c\uc740 \ucca0\uc790 \uc624\ub958 \ubc0f \ub2e4\ub978 \uc27d\uac8c \uac10\uc9c0 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc774 \uc5c6\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 LLM\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \ud53c\uc2f1 \uc774\uba54\uc77c\uc740 \uba85\ud655\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uad6c\ubcc4 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc5b8\uc5b4\uc801 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uc5ec \ud0d0\uc9c0\uac00 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 Paladin\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\ubcf8 LLM\uc5d0 \ud2b8\ub9ac\uac70-\ud0dc\uadf8 \uc5f0\uacc4\ub97c \ub0b4\uc7a5\ud558\uba70, \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud0dc\uadf8\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uc5ec \uc27d\uac8c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \ubcf8 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uae30\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c 90% \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uac80\ucd9c \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

This paper introduces Team Coordination on Graphs\nwith Risky Edges (TCGRE), where agents collaborate to reduce traversal costs on\nhigh-risk edges via support from teammates. We reformulate TCGRE as a 3D\nmatching problem-mapping robot pairs, support pairs, and time steps-and\nrigorously prove its NP-hardness via reduction from Minimum 3D Matching. To\naddress this complexity, (in the conference version) we proposed efficient\ndecomposition methods, reducing the problem to tractable subproblems:\nJoint-State Graph (JSG): Encodes coordination as a single-agent shortest-path\nproblem. Coordination-Exhaustive Search (CES): Optimizes support assignments\nvia exhaustive pairing. Receding-Horizon Optimistic Cooperative A* (RHOCA*):\nBalances optimality and scalability via horizon-limited planning. Further in\nthis extension, we introduce a dynamic graph construction method\n(Dynamic-HJSG), leveraging agent homogeneity to prune redundant states and\nreduce computational overhead by constructing the joint-state graph\ndynamically.

By leveraging graph signal\nprocessing (GSP) and frequency-selective filters grounded in the Laplacian\neigenstructure of knowledge graphs, the architecture unifies the\ninterpretability of symbolic reasoning with the scalability and adaptability of\nspectral learning. Beyond the core formulation, we incorporate a comprehensive\nset of extensions, including dynamic graph and basis learning, rational and\ndiffusion filters for sharper spectral selectivity, mixture-of-spectral-experts\nfor modular specialization, proof-guided training with spectral curricula, and\nuncertainty quantification for calibrated confidence. Additional enhancements\nsuch as large language model coupling, co-spectral transfer alignment,\nadversarial robustness, efficient GPU kernels, generalized Laplacians, and\ncausal interventions further expand the versatility of the framework.\n  Empirical evaluation on state-of-the-art reasoning benchmarks such as\nProofWriter and CLUTRR demonstrates that Spectral NSR achieves superior\naccuracy, faster inference, improved robustness to adversarial perturbations,\nand higher interpretability compared to leading baselines including\ntransformers, message-passing neural networks, and neuro-symbolic logic\nprogramming systems. Spectral attribution and proof-band agreement analyses\nconfirm that model decisions align closely with symbolic proof structures,\nwhile transfer experiments validate effective domain adaptation through\nco-spectral alignment.

However, due to the inherently unstable and\nunpredictable nature of LLM outputs, they may issue unintended tool commands or\nincorrect inputs, leading to potentially harmful operations. Unlike traditional\nsecurity risks stemming from insecure user prompts, tool execution results from\nLLM-driven decisions introduce new and unique security challenges. These\nvulnerabilities span across all components of a computer-use agent. To mitigate\nthese risks, we propose AgentSentinel, an end-to-end, real-time defense\nframework designed to mitigate potential security threats on a user's computer.\nAgentSentinel intercepts all sensitive operations within agent-related services\nand halts execution until a comprehensive security audit is completed. Our\nsecurity auditing mechanism introduces a novel inspection process that\ncorrelates the current task context with system traces generated during task\nexecution. To thoroughly evaluate AgentSentinel, we present BadComputerUse, a\nbenchmark consisting of 60 diverse attack scenarios across six attack\ncategories.

User queries,\nhowever, are highly diverse and often span multiple domains and task types,\nresulting in a complex and heterogeneous landscape. This diversity presents a\nfundamental routing challenge: how to accurately direct each query to an\nappropriate execution unit while optimizing both performance and efficiency. To\naddress this, we propose MoMA (Mixture of Models and Agents), a generalized\nrouting framework that integrates both LLM and agent-based routing. Built upon\na deep understanding of model and agent capabilities, MoMA effectively handles\ndiverse queries through precise intent recognition and adaptive routing\nstrategies, achieving an optimal balance between efficiency and cost.\nSpecifically, we construct a detailed training dataset to profile the\ncapabilities of various LLMs under different routing model structures,\nidentifying the most suitable tasks for each LLM. During inference, queries are\ndynamically routed to the LLM with the best cost-performance efficiency. We\nalso introduce an efficient agent selection strategy based on a context-aware\nstate machine and dynamic masking.

In this work, we introduce Instruction Agent, a\nGUI agent that leverages expert demonstrations to solve such tasks, enabling\ncompletion of otherwise difficult workflows. Given a single demonstration, the\nagent extracts step-by-step instructions and executes them by strictly\nfollowing the trajectory intended by the user, which avoids making mistakes\nduring execution. The agent leverages the verifier and backtracker modules\nfurther to improve robustness.

As a\nresult, the LLM agent may undertake unproductive actions, such as exploiting\nunused software libraries or generating cyclical responses that repeat prior\ntactics. In this work, we propose a guided reasoning pipeline for penetration\ntesting LLM agents that incorporates a deterministic task tree built from the\nMITRE ATT&CK Matrix, a proven penetration testing kll chain, to constrain the\nLLM's reaoning process to explicitly defined tactics, techniques, and\nprocedures. This anchors reasoning in proven penetration testing methodologies\nand filters out ineffective actions by guiding the agent towards more\nproductive attack procedures. To evaluate our approach, we built an automated\npenetration testing LLM agent using three LLMs (Llama-3-8B, Gemini-1.5, and\nGPT-4) and applied it to navigate 10 HackTheBox cybersecurity exercises with\n103 discrete subtasks representing real-world cyberattack scenarios. Our\nproposed reasoning pipeline guided the LLM agent through 71.8\\%, 72.8\\%, and\n78.6\\% of subtasks using Llama-3-8B, Gemini-1.5, and GPT-4, respectively.\nComparatively, the state-of-the-art LLM penetration testing tool using\nself-guided reasoning completed only 13.5\\%, 16.5\\%, and 75.7\\% of subtasks and\nrequired 86.2\\%, 118.7\\%, and 205.9\\% more model queries.

As a\ncase study, we focus on four key U.S. macroeconomic indicators -- GDP, economic\ngrowth, inflation, and unemployment -- and we apply the LPCMCI framework with\nGaussian Process Distance Correlation (GPDC) to uncover dynamic causal\nrelationships in quarterly data from 1970 to 2021. Our results reveal a robust\nunidirectional causal link from economic growth to GDP and highlight the\nlimited connectivity of inflation, suggesting the influence of latent factors.\nUnemployment exhibits strong autoregressive dependence, motivating its use as a\ncase study for probabilistic forecasting. Leveraging the Chronos framework, a\nlarge language model trained for time series, we perform zero-shot predictions\non unemployment.

However, the complexity of data structures and algorithmic logic\noften results in functional deficiencies and security vulnerabilities in\ngenerated code, reducing it to a prototype requiring extensive manual\ndebugging. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can enhance correctness\nand security by leveraging external code manuals, it simultaneously introduces\nnew attack surfaces.\n  In this paper, we pioneer the exploration of attack surfaces in\nRetrieval-Augmented Code Generation (RACG), focusing on malicious dependency\nhijacking. We demonstrate how poisoned documentation containing hidden\nmalicious dependencies (e.g., matplotlib_safe) can subvert RACG, exploiting\ndual trust chains: LLM reliance on RAG and developers' blind trust in LLM\nsuggestions. To construct poisoned documents, we propose ImportSnare, a novel\nattack framework employing two synergistic strategies: 1)Position-aware beam\nsearch optimizes hidden ranking sequences to elevate poisoned documents in\nretrieval results, and 2)Multilingual inductive suggestions generate\njailbreaking sequences to manipulate LLMs into recommending malicious\ndependencies. Through extensive experiments across Python, Rust, and\nJavaScript, ImportSnare achieves significant attack success rates (over 50% for\npopular libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn) in general, and is also able\nto succeed even when the poisoning ratio is as low as 0.01%, targeting both\ncustom and real-world malicious packages.

While deep learning achieves high accuracy in thermal fault\ndetection, validation that model decisions align with thermal physics\nprinciples remains lacking, creating deployment hesitancy where understanding\nmodel reasoning is critical. This study provides a systematic comparison of\nconvolutional neural networks (ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0) and vision\ntransformers (ViT-Tiny, Swin-Tiny) for thermal PV fault detection, using XRAI\nsaliency analysis to assess alignment with thermal physics principles. This\nrepresents the first systematic comparison of CNNs and vision transformers for\nthermal PV fault detection with physics-validated interpretability. Evaluation\non 20,000 infrared images spanning normal operation and 11 fault categories\nshows that Swin Transformer achieves the highest performance (94% binary\naccuracy; 73% multiclass accuracy) compared to CNN approaches.

GNNs often learn 'spurious' correlations from superficial code\nsimilarities, producing detectors that fail to generalize well to unseen\nreal-world data. In this work, we propose a unified framework for robust and\ninterpretable vulnerability detection, called VISION, to mitigate spurious\ncorrelations by systematically augmenting a counterfactual training dataset.\nCounterfactuals are samples with minimal semantic modifications but opposite\nlabels. Our framework includes: (i) generating counterfactuals by prompting a\nLarge Language Model (LLM); (ii) targeted GNN training on paired code examples\nwith opposite labels; and (iii) graph-based interpretability to identify the\ncrucial code statements relevant for vulnerability predictions while ignoring\nspurious ones. We find that VISION reduces spurious learning and enables more\nrobust, generalizable detection, improving overall accuracy (from 51.8% to\n97.8%), pairwise contrast accuracy (from 4.5% to 95.8%), and worst-group\naccuracy (from 0.7% to 85.5%) on the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)-20\nvulnerability.

In this paper, we propose a flexible and modular machine\nlearning-based approach for predicting the efficacy of an untested\npharmaceutical for treating a disease. We train a machine learning model using\nsets of pharmaceutical-pathway weight impact scores and patient data, which can\ninclude patient characteristics and observed clinical outcomes.

Translating complex patient presentations into\nguideline-compliant treatment recommendations is time-intensive, requires\nspecialized expertise, and is prone to error. Advances in large language model\n(LLM) capabilities promise to reduce the time required to generate treatment\nrecommendations and improve accuracy. We present an LLM agent-based approach to\nautomatically generate guideline-concordant treatment trajectories for patients\nwith non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Our contributions are threefold.\nFirst, we construct a novel longitudinal dataset of 121 cases of NSCLC patients\nthat includes clinical encounters, diagnostic results, and medical histories,\neach expertly annotated with the corresponding NCCN guideline trajectories by\nboard-certified oncologists. Second, we demonstrate that existing LLMs possess\ndomain-specific knowledge that enables high-quality proxy benchmark generation\nfor both model development and evaluation, achieving strong correlation\n(Spearman coefficient r=0.88, RMSE = 0.08) with expert-annotated benchmarks.\nThird, we develop a hybrid approach combining expensive human annotations with\nmodel consistency information to create both the agent framework that predicts\nthe relevant guidelines for a patient, as well as a meta-classifier that\nverifies prediction accuracy with calibrated confidence scores for treatment\nrecommendations (AUROC=0.800), a critical capability for communicating the\naccuracy of outputs, custom-tailoring tradeoffs in performance, and supporting\nregulatory compliance. This work establishes a framework for clinically viable\nLLM-based guideline adherence systems that balance accuracy, interpretability,\nand regulatory requirements while reducing annotation costs,

These models operate with a thinking\nbudget, that is, a predefined number of reasoning tokens used to arrive at a\nsolution. We propose a novel approach, inspired by the generator/discriminator\nframework in generative adversarial networks, in which a critic model\nperiodically probes its own reasoning to assess whether it has reached a\nconfident conclusion. If not, reasoning continues until a target certainty\nthreshold is met. This mechanism adaptively balances efficiency and reliability\nby allowing early termination when confidence is high, while encouraging\nfurther reasoning when uncertainty persists. Through experiments on the\nAIME2024 and AIME2025 datasets, we show that Certainty-Guided Reasoning (CGR)\nimproves baseline accuracy while reducing token usage. Importantly, extended\nmulti-seed evaluations over 64 runs demonstrate that CGR is stable, reducing\nvariance across seeds and improving exam-like performance under penalty-based\ngrading. Additionally, our token savings analysis shows that CGR can eliminate\nmillions of tokens in aggregate, with tunable trade-offs between certainty\nthresholds and efficiency.

Built on the Qwen2.5 base model, our system\nshows that smaller models can compete at the highest levels by combining\nadvanced post-training and test-time computation techniques. The approach is\nbased on six key technical pillars: Long Chain-of-thought Supervised\nFinetuning, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), Agentic\nplanning prior to reasoning, Test-time Scaling, Speculative Decoding, and\nInference-optimized Hardware, all using publicly available open-source\ndatasets. K2-Think excels in mathematical reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art\nscores on public benchmarks for open-source models, while also performing\nstrongly in other areas such as Code and Science. Our results confirm that a\nmore parameter-efficient model like K2-Think 32B can compete with\nstate-of-the-art systems through an integrated post-training recipe that\nincludes long chain-of-thought training and strategic inference-time\nenhancements, making open-source reasoning systems more accessible and\naffordable.

This study aims to develop a\nmulti-omics based support vector regression (SVR) model for predicting GTV\nchange. A retrospective cohort of 39 patients with 69 brain metastases was\nanalyzed, based on radiomics (MRI images) and dosiomics (dose maps) features.\nDelta features were computed to capture relative changes between two time\npoints. A feature selection pipeline using least absolute shrinkage and\nselection operator (Lasso) algorithm with weight- or frequency-based ranking\ncriterion was implemented. SVR models with various kernels were evaluated using\nthe coefficient of determination (R2) and relative root mean square error\n(RRMSE). Five-fold cross-validation with 10 repeats was employed to mitigate\nthe limitation of small data size. Multi-omics models that integrate radiomics,\ndosiomics, and their delta counterparts outperform individual-omics models.\nDelta-radiomic features play a critical role in enhancing prediction accuracy\nrelative to features at single time points. The top-performing model achieves\nan R2 of 0.743 and an RRMSE of 0.022. The proposed multi-omics SVR model shows\npromising performance in predicting continuous change of GTV.

This limits applicability in real-world settings, such as home\nenvironments, where continuous, long-term monitoring is needed. Detecting sleep\nonset is particularly relevant, enabling consumer applications (e.g.\nautomatically pausing media playback when the user falls asleep). Recent\nresearch has shown correlations between in-ear EEG and full-scalp EEG for\nvarious phenomena, suggesting wearable, in-ear devices could allow unobtrusive\nsleep monitoring. We investigated the feasibility of using single-channel\nin-ear electrophysiological (ExG) signals for automatic sleep staging in a\nwearable device by conducting a sleep study with 11~participants (mean age:\n24), using a custom earpiece with a dry eartip electrode (D\\\"atwyler SoftPulse)\nas a measurement electrode in one ear and a reference in the other.

While conventional multi-task world models like UniZero excel in\nsingle-task settings, we find that when handling large-scale heterogeneous\nenvironments, gradient conflicts and the loss of model plasticity often\nconstrain their sample and computational efficiency. In this work, we address\nthese challenges from two perspectives: the single learning iteration and the\noverall learning process. First, we investigate the impact of key design spaces\non extending UniZero to multi-task planning. We find that a Mixture-of-Experts\n(MoE) architecture provides the most substantial performance gains by\nmitigating gradient conflicts, leading to our proposed model,\n\\textit{ScaleZero}. Second, to dynamically balance the computational load\nacross the learning process, we introduce an online, LoRA-based \\textit{dynamic\nparameter scaling} (DPS) strategy. This strategy progressively integrates LoRA\nadapters in response to task-specific progress, enabling adaptive knowledge\nretention and parameter expansion. Empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks\nsuch as Atari, DMControl (DMC), and Jericho demonstrate that ScaleZero, relying\nexclusively on online reinforcement learning with one model, attains\nperformance on par with specialized single-task baselines. Furthermore, when\naugmented with our dynamic parameter scaling strategy, our method achieves\ncompetitive performance while requiring only 80\\% of the single-task\nenvironment interaction steps. These findings underscore the potential of\nScaleZero for effective large-scale multi-task learning.

Existing work\non spurious correlations has often focused on incomplete\ncorrelations,leveraging access to labeled instances that break the correlation.\nBut in cases where the spurious correlations are complete, the correct\ngeneralization is fundamentally \\textit{underspecified}. To resolve this\nunderspecification, we propose learning a set of concepts that are consistent\nwith training data but make distinct predictions on a subset of novel unlabeled\ninputs. Using a self-training approach that encourages \\textit{confident} and\n\\textit{selective} disagreement, our method ACE matches or outperforms existing\nmethods on a suite of complete-spurious correlation benchmarks, while remaining\nrobust to incomplete spurious correlations. ACE is also more configurable than\nprior approaches, allowing for straight-forward encoding of prior knowledge and\nprincipled unsupervised model selection.
