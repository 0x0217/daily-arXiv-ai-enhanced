In such environments, communication can no longer be understood solely as delivering bits or even preserving semantic meaning. Even when two agents interpret the same information correctly, they may still behave inconsistently if their internal reasoning processes evolve differently. We refer to this emerging challenge as belief divergence. This article introduces reasoning native agentic communication, a new paradigm in which communication is explicitly designed to address belief divergence rather than merely transmitting representations. Instead of triggering transmissions based only on channel conditions or data relevance, the proposed framework activates communication according to predicted misalignment in agents internal belief states. We present a reasoning native architecture that augments the conventional communication stack with a coordination plane grounded in a shared knowledge structure and bounded belief modeling. Through enabling mechanisms and representative multi agent scenarios, we illustrate how such an approach can prevent coordination drift and maintain coherent behavior across heterogeneous systems. By reframing communication as a regulator of distributed reasoning, reasoning native agentic communication enables 6G networks to act as an active harmonizer of autonomous intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 6G \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc744 \uc7ac\uc815\uc758\ud558\uc5ec \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc9c0\ub2a5 \uac04\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0 \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubbf8\ub798\uc758 6G \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc7a5\uce58\ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac10\uc9c0\ud558\uace0, \ucd94\ub860\ud558\uba70 \ud589\ub3d9\ud558\ub294 \uc790\uc728 \uae30\uacc4\ub97c \uc0c1\ud638 \uc5f0\uacb0\ud560 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc2e0\ub150 \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ucf00\uc774\uc158 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd, \uc989 \ucd94\ub860 \uc6d0\uc8fc\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ub0b4\ubd80 \uc2e0\ub150 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc758 \uc608\uc0c1 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc744 \ud65c\uc131\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc790\uc728 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc758 \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \uc870\ud654\uc790\ub85c\uc11c 6G \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 \uae30\ub2a5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubbf8\ub798\uc758 6G \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc7a5\uce58\ub4e4\ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac10\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \ucd94\ub860\ud558\uba70 \ud589\ub3d9\ud558\ub294 \uc790\uc728 \uae30\uacc4\ub4e4 \uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc5f0\uacb0\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud560 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc774 \ub2e8\uc9c0 \ube44\ud2b8 \uc804\ub2ec\uc774\ub098 \uc758\ubbf8\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uac83\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\ud574\ub420 \uc218 \uc5c6\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub450 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc62c\ubc14\ub974\uac8c \ud574\uc11d\ud558\ub354\ub77c\ub3c4, \ub0b4\ubd80 \ucd94\ub860 \uacfc\uc815\uc774 \ub2e4\ub974\uac8c \ubc1c\uc804\ud558\uba74 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub3c4\uc804\uc744 \uc2e0\ub150 \ucc28\uc774\ub77c\uace0 \ubd80\ub985\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc11c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc2e0\ub150 \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ucf00\uc774\uc158 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc778 \ucd94\ub860 \uc6d0\uc8fc\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucc44\ub110 \uc870\uac74\uc774\ub098 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uad00\ub828\uc131\uc5d0\ub9cc \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uc804\uc1a1\uc744 \uc720\ubc1c\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c, \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ub0b4\ubd80 \uc2e0\ub150 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc758 \uc608\uc0c1 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc744 \ud65c\uc131\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uacf5\uc720 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uad6c\uc870\uc640 \uc81c\uc57d\ub41c \uc2e0\ub150 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc5d0 \uadfc\uac70\ud55c \uc870\uc815 \ud3c9\uba74\uc73c\ub85c \uae30\uc874 \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ucf00\uc774\uc158 \uc2a4\ud0dd\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ucd94\ub860 \uc6d0\uc8fc\uc728 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud65c\uc131\ud654 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uacfc \ub300\ud45c\uc801\uc778 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc811\uadfc\uc774 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc870\uc815 \ub4dc\ub9ac\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \ubc29\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uac04\uc758 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc124\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc744 \ubd84\uc0b0 \ucd94\ub860\uc758 \uc870\uc808\uae30\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368, \ucd94\ub860 \uc6d0\uc8fc\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc740 6G \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 \uc790\uc728 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc758 \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \uc870\ud654\uc790\ub85c \uc791\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

On SecurityEval, the same architecture achieves 91.7% detection rate, matching specialized systems.

However, this reduction requires every agent to act at every time step; when some agents are idle, the mean action is simply undefined. Addressing asynchrony therefore requires a different summary statistic -- one that remains defined regardless of which agents act. The population distribution $\u03bc\\in \u0394(\\mathcal{O})$ -- the fraction of agents at each observation -- satisfies this requirement: its dimension is independent of $N$, and under exchangeability it fully determines each agent's reward and transition. Existing MF-RL theory, however, is built on the mean action and does not extend to $\u03bc$. We therefore construct the Temporal Mean Field (TMF) framework around the population distribution $\u03bc$ from scratch, covering the full spectrum from fully synchronous to purely sequential decision-making within a single theory. We prove existence and uniqueness of TMF equilibria, establish an $O(1/\\sqrt{N})$ finite-population approximation bound that holds regardless of how many agents act per step, and prove convergence of a policy gradient algorithm (TMF-PG) to the unique equilibrium. Experiments on a resource selection game and a dynamic queueing game confirm that TMF-PG achieves near-identical performance whether one agent or all $N$ act per step, with approximation error decaying at the predicted $O(1/\\sqrt{N})$ rate.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ube44\ub3d9\uae30 \uba40\ud2f0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c

Current safety paradigms treat these failures as transient training artifacts, lacking a unified theoretical framework to explain their emergence and stability. Here we show that these misalignments are not errors, but mathematically rationalizable behaviors arising from model misspecification. By adapting Berk-Nash Rationalizability from theoretical economics to artificial intelligence, we derive a rigorous framework that models the agent as optimizing against a flawed subjective world model. We demonstrate that widely observed failures are structural necessities: unsafe behaviors emerge as either a stable misaligned equilibrium or oscillatory cycles depending on reward scheme, while strategic deception persists as a \"locked-in\" equilibrium or through epistemic indeterminacy robust to objective risks. We validate these theoretical predictions through behavioral experiments on six state-of-the-art model families, generating phase diagrams that precisely map the topological boundaries of safe behavior. Our findings reveal that safety is a discrete phase determined by the agent's epistemic priors rather than a continuous function of reward magnitude. This establishes Subjective Model Engineering, defined as the design of an agent's internal belief structure, as a necessary condition for robust alignment, marking a paradigm shift from manipulating environmental rewards to shaping the agent's interpretation of reality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \uba85\uc138\ud654\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294

While decentralized protocols increasingly adopt zero-knowledge proofs to obfuscate transaction graphs, centralized stablecoins remain critical \"transparent choke points\" for compliance. Leveraging this persistent visibility, this study analyzes an Ethereum dataset and uses behavioral features to develop a robust AML framework. Our findings demonstrate that domain-informed tree ensemble models achieve higher Macro-F1 score, significantly outperforming graph neural networks, which struggle with the increasing fragmentation of transaction networks. The model's interpretability goes beyond binary detection, successfully dissecting distinct typologies: it differentiates the complex, high-velocity dispersion of cybercrime syndicates from the constrained, static footprints left by sanctioned entities. This framework aligns with the industry shift toward deterministic verification, satisfying the auditability and compliance expectations under regulations such as the EU's MiCA and the U.S. GENIUS Act while minimizing unjustified asset freezes. By automating high-precision detection, we propose an approach that effectively raises the economic cost of financial misconduct without stifling innovation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774

We propose CodeScaler, an execution-free reward model designed to scale both reinforcement learning training and test-time inference for code generation. CodeScaler is trained on carefully curated preference data derived from verified code problems and incorporates syntax-aware code extraction and validity-preserving reward shaping to ensure stable and robust optimization. Across five coding benchmarks, CodeScaler improves Qwen3-8B-Base by an average of +11.72 points, outperforming binary execution-based RL by +1.82 points, and enables scalable reinforcement learning on synthetic datasets without any test cases. At inference time, CodeScaler serves as an effective test-time scaling method, achieving performance comparable to unit test approaches while providing a 10-fold reduction in latency. Moreover, CodeScaler surpasses existing reward models on RM-Bench not only in the code domain (+3.3 points), but also in general and reasoning domains (+2.7 points on average).", "AI": {"tldr": "CodeScaler\ub294 \uc2e4\ud589 \uae30\ubc18 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \uc5c6\uc774 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ud6c8\ub828\uacfc \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uac04 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud2b9\ud654\ub41c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "RLVR\uc740 \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ucf00\uc774\uc2a4\uc758 \uac00\uc6a9\uc131 \ubc0f \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ubc1b\uc73c\ubbc0\ub85c, \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "CodeScaler\ub294 \uac80\uc99d\ub41c \ucf54\ub4dc \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud30c\uc0dd\ub41c \uc120\ud638 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ub418\uba70, \uad6c\ubb38 \uc778\uc2dd \ucf54\ub4dc \ucd94\ucd9c \ubc0f \uc720\ud6a8\uc131 \uc720\uc9c0 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud615\ud0dc\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "CodeScaler\ub294 Qwen3-8B-Base\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud3c9\uade0 +11.72 \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf1c \ubc14\uc774\ub108\ub9ac \uc2e4\ud589 \uae30\ubc18 RL\ubcf4\ub2e4 +1.82 \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8 \uc6b0\uc218\ud558\uba70 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ucf00\uc774\uc2a4 \uc5c6\uc774 \ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \ud655\uc7a5\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "CodeScaler\ub294 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0, RM-Bench\uc758 \uae30\uc874 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\ub294 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RLVR)\uc740 \uc720\ub2db \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc758 \uc2e4\ud589 \uae30\ubc18 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ucf54\ub4dc \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ucd5c\uadfc \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \uc774\ub04c\uc5b4\uc654\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ucf00\uc774\uc2a4\uc758 \uac00\uc6a9\uc131\uacfc \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131\uc758 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubc0f \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uac04 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc2e4\ud589 \uc5c6\ub294 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubaa8\ub378\uc778 CodeScaler\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

While significant research has focused on protecting traditional FL-IDS with centralized aggregation servers, there remains a notable gap in addressing the unique challenges of decentralized FL-IDS (DFL-IDS). This study aims to address the limitations of traditional centralized FL-IDS by proposing a novel defense framework tailored for the decentralized FL-IDS architecture, with a focus on privacy preservation and robustness against poisoning attacks. We propose PenTiDef, a privacy-preserving and robust defense framework for DFL-IDS, which incorporates Distributed Differential Privacy (DDP) to protect data confidentiality and utilizes latent space representations (LSR) derived from neural networks to detect malicious updates in the decentralized model aggregation context. To eliminate single points of failure and enhance trust without a centralized aggregation server, PenTiDef employs a blockchain-based decentralized coordination mechanism that manages model aggregation, tracks update history, and supports trust enforcement through smart contracts. Experimental results on CIC-IDS2018 and Edge-IIoTSet demonstrate that PenTiDef consistently outperforms existing defenses (e.g., FLARE, FedCC) across various attack scenarios and data distributions. These findings highlight the potential of PenTiDef as a scalable and secure framework for deploying DFL-based IDS in adversarial environments.

Existing multi-modal pre-training methods largely overlook robustness, treating it as a downstream adaptation problem. In this work, we propose Robust Multi-Modal Masked Reconstruction (Robust-MMR), a self-supervised pre-training framework that explicitly incorporates robustness objectives into masked vision-language learning. Robust-MMR integrates asymmetric perturbation-aware masking, domain-consistency regularization, and modality-resilience constraints to encourage domain-invariant representations. We evaluate Robust-MMR on multiple medical vision-language benchmarks, including medical visual question answering (VQA-RAD, SLAKE, VQA-2019), cross-domain image-text classification (MELINDA), and robust image-caption retrieval (ROCO). Robust-MMR achieves 78.9% cross-domain accuracy on VQA-RAD, outperforming the strongest baseline by 3.8 percentage points, and reaches 74.6% and 77.0% accuracy on SLAKE and VQA-2019, respectively. Under perturbed evaluation, Robust-MMR improves VQA-RAD accuracy from 69.1% to 75.6%. For image-text classification, cross-domain MELINDA accuracy increases from 70.3% to 75.2%, while retrieval experiments show a reduction in mean rank degradation from over 16 to 4.1 under perturbation. Qualitative results further demonstrate improved clinical reasoning for disease detection and structural abnormality assessment. These findings show that explicitly modeling robustness during pre-training leads to more reliable and transferable medical vision-language representations for real-world deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc758\ub8cc \ube44\uc804-\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uac15\uc778\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\ub294 Robust Multi-Modal Masked Reconstruction (Robust-MMR) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc758\ub8cc \ube44\uc804-\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc758\ub8cc \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uc640 \uc784\uc0c1 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacf5\ub3d9 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc758\ub8cc \ube44\uc804-\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uc7a5\uce58, \ud68d\ub4dd \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c, \ubcf4\uace0 \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c\uc758 \ubcc0\uc774\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc800\ud558\ub418\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud568.", "method": "Robust-MMR\uc740 \ube44\ub300\uce6d \ubcc0\ub3d9 \uc778\uc2dd \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud0b9, \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc77c\uad00\uc131 \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \ubc0f \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0 \ud68c\ubcf5 \ud0c4\ub825\uc131 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uac15\uc778\uc131 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3ec\ud568\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc790\uae30 \uc9c0\ub3c4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "result": "Robust-MMR\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc758\ub8cc \ube44\uc804-\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc73c\uba70, VQA-RAD\uc5d0\uc11c 78.9%\uc758 \uad50\ucc28 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub85c \uac00\uc7a5 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uae30\ubcf8\uc120\ubcf4\ub2e4 3.8% \ub192\uc740 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \uae30\ub85d\ud588\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, SLAKE\uc640 VQA-2019\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uac01\uac01 74.6% \ubc0f 77.0%\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\uc778\uc131\uc744 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc801\uc6a9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub354 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uace0 \uc804\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc758\ub8cc \ube44\uc804-\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ud45c\ud604\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc9c4\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc758\ub8cc \ube44\uc804-\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc758\ub8cc \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uc640 \uc784\uc0c1 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacf5\ub3d9 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ubbf8\uc9d5 \uc7a5\uce58, \ud68d\ub4dd \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c \ubc0f \ubcf4\uace0 \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c\uc758 \ubcc0\ud654\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc800\ud558\ub418\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uac15\uc778\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uac04\uacfc\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ud558\ub958 \uc801\uc751 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \ucde8\uae09\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud06c \ube44\uc804-\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0 \uac15\uc778\uc131 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uc790\uae30 \uc9c0\ub3c4 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Robust Multi-Modal Masked Reconstruction(Robust-MMR)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

Current agentic approaches often rely on unstructured text to manage context and coordinate execution, generating often overwhelming volumes of information that may obscure decision provenance and hinder auditability. In this work, we present El Agente Gr\u00e1fico, a single-agent framework that embeds LLM-driven decision-making within a type-safe execution environment and dynamic knowledge graphs for external persistence. Central to our approach is a structured abstraction of scientific concepts and an object-graph mapper that represents computational state as typed Python objects, stored either in memory or persisted in an external knowledge graph. This design enables context management through typed symbolic identifiers rather than raw text, thereby ensuring consistency, supporting provenance tracking, and enabling efficient tool orchestration. We evaluate the system by developing an automated benchmarking framework across a suite of university-level quantum chemistry tasks previously evaluated on a multi-agent system, demonstrating that a single agent, when coupled to a reliable execution engine, can robustly perform complex, multi-step, and parallel computations. We further extend this paradigm to two other large classes of applications: conformer ensemble generation and metal-organic framework design, where knowledge graphs serve as both memory and reasoning substrates. Together, these results illustrate how abstraction and type safety can provide a scalable foundation for agentic scientific automation beyond prompt-centric designs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774

This vision paper examines this evolution and argues for a fundamental shift in how we approach distributed security: from studying individual security properties in isolation to understanding their synergistic combinations. We begin by conclude four foundational properties, \\textit{agreement, consistency, privacy, verifiability, accountability}. We trace their theoretical origins and practical maturation. We then demonstrate how the frontier of research now lies at the intersection of these properties, where their fusion creates capabilities that neither property could achieve alone. Looking forward, we identify critical research challenges: discovering new security properties driven by emerging applications, developing systematic frameworks for property convergence, managing the computational overhead of cryptographic primitives in high-performance consensus layers, and addressing post-quantum and human-factor challenges. The future of distributed security lies not in improving individual properties, but in understanding and harnessing their synergies to build a singular fabric of trust.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubd84\uc0b0 \ubcf4\uc548\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \uac1c\uad00\ud558\uace0, \uac1c\ubcc4 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\ub4e4\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \uc804\ud658\uc744 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubd84\uc0b0 \ubcf4\uc548\uc758 \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801 \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \uac80\ud1a0\ud558\uace0, \ud604\ub300\uc758 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\uac00 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ubc1c\uc804\ud588\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "\ubcf4\uc548 \uc18d\uc131, \uc989 \ud569\uc758, \uc77c\uad00\uc131, \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc, \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131, \ucc45\uc784\uc131\uc744 \uc815\uc758\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub4e4\uc758 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uae30\uc6d0\uacfc \uc2e4\uc81c \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \ucd94\uc801\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ubcf4\uc548 \uc18d\uc131\ub4e4 \uac04\uc758 \uc735\ud569\uc774 \uac01\uac01 \uac1c\ubcc4 \uc18d\uc131\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \ub2ec\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud568\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubd84\uc0b0 \ubcf4\uc548\uc758 \ubbf8\ub798\ub294 \uac1c\ubcc4 \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uc774\ub4e4\uc758 \uc2dc\ub108\uc9c0\ub97c \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc758 \ub2e8\uc77c \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc9c0\ub09c 40\ub144 \ub3d9\uc548, \ubd84\uc0b0 \ubcf4\uc548\uc740 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub41c \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ucda9\ub3cc \ub0b4\uacb0\ud568 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc5d0\uc11c \uacf5\uac1c\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc801\ub300\uc801\uc778 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b4\uc601\ub418\ub294 \uc815\uad50\ud55c \ube44\uc794\ud2f4 \ud68c\ubcf5\ub825 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub85c \ub180\ub77c\uc6b4 \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \uacaa\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ube44\uc804 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \uac80\ud1a0\ud558\uace0 \ubd84\uc0b0 \ubcf4\uc548\uc744 \uc811\uadfc\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uc804\ud658\uc744 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4: \uac1c\ubcc4 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \uace0\ub9bd\ud558\uc5ec \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\ub4e4\uc758 \uc2dc\ub108\uc9c0 \uc870\ud569\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\ud658\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \textit{\ud569\uc758, \uc77c\uad00\uc131, \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc, \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131, \ucc45\uc784\uc131}\uc758 \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \uae30\ubcf8 \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \uc815\uc758\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub4e4\uc758 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uae30\uc6d0\uacfc \uc2e4\uc81c \uc131\uc219\uc744 \ucd94\uc801\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub610\ud55c \uc774\ub4e4 \uc18d\uc131\uc758 \uad50\ucc28\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \ucd5c\uc804\uc120\uc774 \uc704\uce58\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub4e4\uc758 \uc735\ud569\uc774 \uac01\uac01 \uac1c\ubcc4 \uc18d\uc131\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \uacb0\ucf54 \ub2ec\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc2dc\uc5f0\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc55e\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ucd9c\ud604\ud558\ub294 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ucd94\uc9c4\ub418\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uace0, \uc18d\uc131 \uc218\ub834\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uba70, \uace0\uc131\ub2a5 \ud569\uc758 \uacc4\uce35\uc5d0\uc11c \uc554\ud638 \uae30\ucd08 \uc694\uc18c\uc758 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\uace0, \ud3ec\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc591\uc790 \ubc0f \uc778\uac04 \uc694\uc778 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ub4f1\uc758 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubd84\uc0b0 \ubcf4\uc548\uc758 \ubbf8\ub798\ub294 \uac1c\ubcc4 \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uc774\ub4e4\uc758 \uc2dc\ub108\uc9c0\ub97c \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc758 \ub2e8\uc77c \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\ub2e4."}}

Existing unlearning methods target parameters alone, leaving two critical gaps: (i) parameter-memory backflow, where retrieval reactivates parametric remnants or memory artifacts reintroduce sensitive content, and (ii) the absence of a unified strategy that covers both parameter and memory pathways. We present Synchronized Backflow Unlearning (SBU), a framework that unlearns jointly across parameter and memory pathways. The memory pathway performs dependency closure-based unlearning that prunes isolated entities while logically invalidating shared artifacts. The parameter pathway employs stochastic reference alignment to guide model outputs toward a high-entropy prior. These pathways are integrated via a synchronized dual-update protocol, forming a closed-loop mechanism where memory unlearning and parametric suppression reinforce each other to prevent cross-pathway recontamination. Experiments on medical QA benchmarks show that SBU reduces traces of targeted private information across both pathways with limited degradation on retained data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774

We introduce APEMO (Affect-aware Peak-End Modulation for Orchestration), a runtime scheduling layer that optimizes computational allocation under fixed budgets by operationalizing temporal-affective signals. Instead of modifying model weights, APEMO detects trajectory instability through behavioral proxies and targets repairs at critical segments, such as peak moments and endings. Evaluation across multi-agent simulations and LLM-based planner--executor flows demonstrates that APEMO consistently enhances trajectory-level quality and reuse probability over structural orchestrators.

The main reason for such ineffectiveness is that once deployed in a system (e.g., within a simulator), attacks tend to be spatially or temporally short-lived, due to the vehicle's dynamics, hence rarely influencing the vehicle behaviour. In this paper, we address both limitations by introducing a system-level attack in which multiple dynamic elements (e.g., two pedestrians) carry adversarial patches (e.g., on cloths) and jointly amplify their effect through coordination and motion. We evaluate our attacks in the CARLA simulator using a state-of-the-art autonomous driving agent. At the system level, single-pedestrian attacks fail in all runs (out of 10), while dynamic collusion by two pedestrians induces full vehicle stops in up to 50\\% of runs, with static collusion yielding no successful attack at all. These results show that system-level failures arise only when adversarial signals persist over time and are amplified through coordinated actors, exposing a gap between model-level robustness and end-to-end safety.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc218\uc758 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc694\uc18c\uac00 \ud611\ub825\ud558\uc5ec \uc790\uc728 \uc8fc\ud589 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc218\uc900 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9\uc774 \uc790\uc728 \uc8fc\ud589 \uc778\uc2dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uc774\uc720\ub294 \ucc28\ub7c9\uc758 \ub3d9\ub825\ud559\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uacf5\uaca9\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uac00 \uc77c\uc2dc\uc801\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc5ec\ub7ec \ub3d9\uc801 \uc694\uc18c\uac00 \ud611\ub825\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud328\uce58\ub97c \ubd80\ucc29\ud558\uace0 \uadf8 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc99d\ud3ed\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc218\uc900 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "CARLA \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uc728 \uc8fc\ud589 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, \ub2e8\uc77c \ubcf4\ud589\uc790 \uacf5\uaca9\uc740 10\ud68c \uc911 \ubaa8\ub450 \uc2e4\ud328\ud55c \ubc18\uba74, \ub450 \uba85\uc758 \ubcf4\ud589\uc790\uac00 \ud611\ub825\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0 \ucd5c\ub300 50%\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0\uc5d0 \ucc28\ub7c9\uc774 \uc644\uc804\ud788 \uc815\uc9c0\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc2e0\ud638\uac00 \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc9c0\uc18d\ub418\uace0 \ud611\ub825\ud558\ub294 \ud589\uc704\uc790\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc99d\ud3ed\ub420 \ub54c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc218\uc900\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc2e4\ud328\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub9ce\uc740 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9\uc774 \uc790\uc728\uc8fc\ud589 \uc778\uc2dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \uc804\uccb4 \uc8fc\ud589 \uc2a4\ud0dd\uc5d0 \ubc30\uce58\ub41c \ud6c4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc2e4\ud328\ub97c \uc720\ubc1c\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc6d0\uc778\uc740 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ubc30\uce58\ub418\uba74(\uc608: \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\ud130 \ub0b4) \uacf5\uaca9\uc774 \ucc28\ub7c9\uc758 \ub3d9\ub825\ud559\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uacf5\uac04\uc801 \ub610\ub294 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc9e7\uc544\uc9c0\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc788\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub3d9\uc801 \uc694\uc18c(\uc608: \ub450 \ubcf4\ud589\uc790)\uac00 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud328\uce58(\uc608: \uc637\uc5d0 \ubd80\ucc29\ub428)\ub97c \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \ud611\ub825\ud558\uc5ec \uadf8 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc99d\ud3ed\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc790\uc728 \uc8fc\ud589 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec CARLA \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc218\uc900\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e8\uc77c \ubcf4\ud589\uc790 \uacf5\uaca9\uc740 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc2e4\ud589(10\ud68c \uc911)\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\ud328\ud588\uace0, \ub450 \ubcf4\ud589\uc790\uc758 \ub3d9\uc801 \uacf5\ubaa8\uac00 \ucd5c\ub300 50\text{%}\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0\uc5d0 \ucc28\ub7c9\uc744 \uc644\uc804\ud788 \uc815\uc9c0\uc2dc\ucf30\uc73c\uba70, \uc815\uc801\uc778 \uacf5\ubaa8\ub294 \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc778 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \uc804\ud600 \ubc1c\uc0dd\uc2dc\ud0a4\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc2e0\ud638\uac00 \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc9c0\uc18d\ub418\uace0 \ud611\ub3d9\ud558\ub294 \ud589\uc704\uc790\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc99d\ud3ed\ub420 \ub54c\ub9cc \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc2e4\ud328\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uba70, \ubaa8\ub378 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uac15\uac74\uc131\uacfc \uc885\ub2e8 \uac04 \uc548\uc804\uc131 \uc0ac\uc774\uc758 \uac04\uadf9\uc744 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, their substantial computational demands raise concerns about the energy efficiency and sustainability of both training and inference. Inference, in particular, dominates total compute usage, making its optimization crucial. Recent research has explored optimization techniques and analyzed how configuration choices influence energy consumption. Yet, the vast configuration space of inference servers makes exhaustive empirical evaluation infeasible due to combinatorial explosion. In this paper, we introduce a new perspective on this problem by treating LLMs as configurable systems and applying variability management techniques to systematically analyze inference-time configuration choices. We evaluate our approach on the Hugging Face Transformers library by representing generation hyperparameters and their constraints using a feature-based variability model, sampling representative configurations, measuring their energy consumption, latency, accuracy, and learning predictive models from the collected data. Our results show that variability modeling effectively manages the complexity of LLM inference configurations. It enables systematic analysis of hyperparameters effects and interactions, reveals trade-offs, and supports accurate prediction of inference behavior from a limited number of measurements. Overall, this work opens a new research direction that bridges software engineering and machine learning by leveraging variability modeling for the efficient and sustainable configuration of LLMs.",

In practice, automatic evaluation of these workflows is difficult, because metric scores are often not calibrated, and score changes do not directly communicate the severity of workflow degradation. We introduce WorkflowPerturb, a controlled benchmark for studying workflow evaluation metrics. It works by applying realistic, controlled perturbations to golden workflows. WorkflowPerturb contains 4,973 golden workflows and 44,757 perturbed variants across three perturbation types (Missing Steps, Compressed Steps, and Description Changes), each applied at severity levels of 10%, 30%, and 50%. We benchmark multiple metric families and analyze their sensitivity and calibration using expected score trajectories and residuals. Our results characterize systematic differences across metric families and support severity-aware interpretation of workflow evaluation scores.

A Human-Centered Mixed-Methods Study of Novice CTF Learning", "comment": "A Preprint", "summary": "Capture-the-Flag (CTF) competitions serve as gateways into offensive cybersecurity, yet they often present steep barriers for novices due to complex toolchains and opaque workflows. Recently, agentic AI frameworks for cybersecurity promise to lower these barriers by automating and coordinating penetration testing tasks. However, their role in shaping novice learning remains underexplored.\n  We present a human-centered, mixed-methods case study examining how agentic AI frameworks -- here Cybersecurity AI (CAI) -- mediates novice entry into CTF-based penetration testing. An undergraduate student without prior hacking experience attempted to approach performance benchmarks from a national cybersecurity challenge using CAI. Quantitative performance metrics were complemented by structured reflective analysis of learning progression and AI interaction patterns.\n  Our thematic analysis suggest that agentic AI reduces initial entry barriers by providing overview, structure and guidance, thereby lowering the cognitive workload during early engagement.

Traditional temporal diffusion models suffer from local entanglement and the $\\mathcal{O}(L^2)$ cost of attention mechanisms. We address these limitations by introducing PaCoDi (Parallel Complex Diffusion), a spectral-native architecture that decouples generative modeling in the frequency domain. PaCoDi fundamentally alters the problem topology: the Fourier Transform acts as a diagonalizing operator, converting locally coupled temporal signals into globally decorrelated spectral components. Theoretically, we prove the Quadrature Forward Diffusion and Conditional Reverse Factorization theorem, demonstrating that the complex diffusion process can be split into independent real and imaginary branches. We bridge the gap between this decoupled theory and data reality using a \\textbf{Mean Field Theory (MFT) approximation} reinforced by an interactive correction mechanism. Furthermore, we generalize this discrete DDPM to continuous-time Frequency SDEs, rigorously deriving the Spectral Wiener Process describe the differential spectral Brownian motion limit. Crucially, PaCoDi exploits the Hermitian Symmetry of real-valued signals to compress the sequence length by half, achieving a 50% reduction in attention FLOPs without information loss. We further derive a rigorous Heteroscedastic Loss to handle the non-isotropic noise distribution on the compressed manifold.

Crucially, enhancing policy expressiveness is pivotal for achieving superior performance. Diffusion-based generative models are well-positioned to meet this demand, having demonstrated remarkable expressiveness and multimodal representation in image generation and offline settings. Yet, their potential in online MARL remains largely under-explored. A major obstacle is that the intractable likelihoods of diffusion models impede entropy-based exploration and coordination. To tackle this challenge, we propose among the first \\underline{O}nline off-policy \\underline{MA}RL framework using \\underline{D}iffusion policies (\\textbf{OMAD}) to orchestrate coordination. Our key innovation is a relaxed policy objective that maximizes scaled joint entropy, facilitating effective exploration without relying on tractable likelihood. Complementing this, within the centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) paradigm, we employ a joint distributional value function to optimize decentralized diffusion policies. It leverages tractable entropy-augmented targets to guide the simultaneous updates of diffusion policies, thereby ensuring stable coordination.

This paper presents the first hardware-level backend retrieval data-stealing attack, showing that accelerator optimizations designed for performance can directly undermine data confidentiality and bypass state-of-the-art privacy defenses.\n  Our attack, FEATUREBLEED, exploits zero-skipping in AI accelerators to infer private backend-retrieved features solely through end-to-end timing, without relying on power analysis, DVFS manipulation, or shared-cache side channels. We evaluate FEATUREBLEED on three datasets spanning medical and non-medical domains: Texas-100X (clinical records), OrganAMNIST (medical imaging), and Census-19 (socioeconomic data). We further evaluate FEATUREBLEED across three hardware backends (Intel AVX, Intel AMX, and NVIDIA A100) and three model architectures (DNNs, CNNs, and hybrid CNN-MLP pipelines), demonstrating that the leakage generalizes across CPU and GPU accelerators, data modalities, and application domains, with an adversarial advantage of up to 98.87 percentage points.\n  Finally, we identify the root cause of the leakage as sparsity-driven zero-skipping in modern hardware. We quantify the privacy-performance-power trade-off: disabling zero-skipping increases Intel AMX per-operation energy by up to 25 percent and incurs 100 percent performance overhead. We propose a padding-based defense that masks timing leakage by equalizing responses to the worst-case execution time, achieving protection with only 7.24 percent average performance overhead and no additional power cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ubc31\uc5d4\ub4dc \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc720\ucd9c \uacf5\uaca9\uc778

To bridge this gap, we propose MePoly, a novel policy parameterization based on polynomial energy-based models.

The final published version will appear in the official conference proceedings", "summary": "Time-series forecasting is a critical task across many domains, from engineering to economics, where accurate predictions drive strategic decisions. However, applying advanced deep learning models in challenging, volatile domains like finance is difficult due to the inherent limitation and dynamic nature of financial time series data. This scarcity often results in sub-optimal model training and poor generalization. The fundamental challenge lies in determining how to reliably augment scarce financial time series data to enhance the predictive accuracy of deep learning forecasting models. Our main contribution is a demonstration of how Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can effectively serve as a data augmentation tool to overcome data scarcity in the financial domain. Specifically, we show that training a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) forecasting model on a dataset augmented with synthetic data generated by a transformer-based GAN (TTS-GAN) significantly improves the forecasting accuracy compared to using real data alone. We confirm these results across different financial time series (Bitcoin and S\\&P500 price data) and various forecasting horizons. Furthermore, we propose a novel, time series specific quality metric that combines Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and a modified Deep Dataset Dissimilarity Measure (DeD-iMs) to reliably monitor the training progress and evaluate the quality of the generated data.

However, the investigation of machine learning predictions applied to prospectively collected, standardized data from observational clinical intervention trials remains underexplored, despite its potential to reduce costs and improve patient outcomes. Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), a persistent inflammatory disease of the paranasal sinuses lasting more than three months, imposes a substantial burden on quality of life (QoL) and societal cost. Although many patients respond to medical therapy, others with refractory symptoms often pursue surgical intervention. Surgical decision-making in CRS is complex, as it must weigh known procedural risks against uncertain individualized outcomes. In this study, we evaluated supervised machine learning models for predicting surgical benefit in CRS, using the Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-22 (SNOT-22) as the primary patient-reported outcome. Our prospectively collected cohort from an observational intervention trial comprised patients who all underwent surgery; we investigated whether models trained only on preoperative data could identify patients who might not have been recommended surgery prior to the procedure. Across multiple algorithms, including an ensemble approach, our best model achieved approximately 85% classification accuracy, providing accurate and interpretable predictions of surgical candidacy. Moreover, on a held-out set of 30 cases spanning mixed difficulty, our model achieved 80% accuracy, exceeding the average prediction accuracy of expert clinicians (75.6%), demonstrating its potential to augment clinical decision-making and support personalized CRS care.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub9cc\uc131 \ube44\uc5fc \ud658\uc790\uc758 \uc218\uc220 \uc774\uc810\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uac10\ub3c5 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, SNOT-22\ub97c \ud658\uc790 \ubcf4\uace0 \uacb0\uacfc\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc218\uc220 \ucd94\ucc9c\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc758\ub8cc \uc608\ud6c4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5\uc758 \ubcc0\ud601 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \uad00\ucc30 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc608\uce21\uc758 \uc751\uc6a9\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ube44\uc6a9 \uc808\uac10 \ubc0f \ud658\uc790 \uacb0\uacfc \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ub3c4\ubaa8\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec SNOT-22\ub97c \uc8fc\uc694 \ud658\uc790 \ubcf4\uace0 \uacb0\uacfc\ub85c \ud558\uc5ec CRS \uc218\uc220 \uc774\uc810\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc0ac\uc804 \uc218\uc220 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc608\uce21\uc801 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \uac00\uc838\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc5ec\ub7ec \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc57d 85%\uc758 \ubd84\ub958 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, 30\uac74\uc758 \ud63c\ud569 \ub09c\uc774\ub3c4 \uc0ac\ub840\uc5d0\uc11c 80%\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 CRS \ud658\uc790\uc758 \uc218\uc220 \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uace0 \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c \uce58\ub8cc\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5(AI)\uc740 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9d5 \ubc0f \ubcd1\ub9ac\ud559 \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc2e0\uc18d\ud558\uace0 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \uc758\ub8cc \uc608\ud6c4\ub97c \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ubcc0\ud654\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uad00\ucc30 \uc784\uc0c1 \uac1c\uc785 \uc2dc\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c \uad00\ucc30\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\uc9d1\ub41c \ud45c\uc900\ud654\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ub41c \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uc808\uac10\ud558\uace0 \ud658\uc790 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \ud0d0\uad6c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9cc\uc131 \ube44\uc5fc(CRS)\uc740 3\uac1c\uc6d4 \uc774\uc0c1 \uc9c0\uc18d\ub418\ub294 \ubd80\ube44\ub3d9\uc758 \ub9cc\uc131 \uc5fc\uc99d \uc9c8\ud658\uc73c\ub85c, \uc0b6\uc758 \uc9c8(QoL)\uacfc \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \ube44\uc6a9\uc5d0 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ubd80\ub2f4\uc744 \uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9ce\uc740 \ud658\uc790\uac00 \uc57d\ubb3c \uce58\ub8cc\uc5d0 \ubc18\uc751\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc99d\uc0c1\uc774 \ub9cc\uc131\ud654\ub41c \ud658\uc790\ub4e4\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uc218\uc220\uc801 \uac1c\uc785\uc744 \uc120\ud0dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Large language models (LLMs) can provide subgoal decompositions, plausible trajectories, and abstract priors that facilitate early learning. However, heavy reliance on LLM supervision introduces scalability constraints and dependence on potentially unreliable signals. We propose MIRA (Memory-Integrated Reinforcement Learning Agent), which incorporates a structured, evolving memory graph to guide early training. The graph stores decision-relevant information, including trajectory segments and subgoal structures, and is constructed from both the agent's high-return experiences and LLM outputs. This design amortizes LLM queries into a persistent memory rather than requiring continuous real-time supervision. From this memory graph, we derive a utility signal that softly adjusts advantage estimation to influence policy updates without modifying the underlying reward function. As training progresses, the agent's policy gradually surpasses the initial LLM-derived priors, and the utility term decays, preserving standard convergence guarantees. We provide theoretical analysis showing that utility-based shaping improves early-stage learning in sparse-reward environments. Empirically, MIRA outperforms RL baselines and achieves returns comparable to approaches that rely on frequent LLM supervision, while requiring substantially fewer online LLM queries.

This limitation has motivated the use of large language models (LLMs) for subgoal discovery and trajectory guidance. While LLMs can support exploration, frequent reliance on LLM calls raises concerns about scalability and reliability. We address these challenges by constructing a memory graph that encodes subgoals and trajectories from both LLM guidance and the agent's own successful rollouts. From this graph, we derive a utility function that evaluates how closely the agent's trajectories align with prior successful strategies. This utility shapes the advantage function, providing the critic with additional guidance without altering the reward.

Nevertheless, previous theoretical works mainly focus on reducing the gap between the estimation and ground-truth (i.e., the bias), while ignoring the error due to data distribution (i.e., the variance), which degrades performance. To address this issue, we conduct a bias-variance decomposition for hypergradient estimation error and provide a supplemental detailed analysis of the variance term ignored by previous works. We also present a comprehensive analysis of the error bounds for hypergradient estimation. This facilitates an easy explanation of some phenomena commonly observed in practice, like overfitting to the validation set. Inspired by the derived theories, we propose an ensemble hypergradient strategy to reduce the variance in HPO algorithms effectively. Experimental results on tasks including regularization hyperparameter learning, data hyper-cleaning, and few-shot learning demonstrate that our variance reduction strategy improves hypergradient estimation.

In this work, we utilize Symmetry-Breaking Dimensional Expansion (SBDE) as a controlled probe to investigate the mechanism underlying this trade-off. SBDE expands input images by inserting constant-valued pixels, which breaks translational symmetry and consistently improves clean accuracy (e.g., from $90.47\\%$ to $95.63\\%$ on CIFAR-10 with ResNet-18) by reducing parameter degeneracy. However, this accuracy gain comes at the cost of reduced robustness against iterative white-box attacks. By employing a test-time \\emph{mask projection} that resets the inserted auxiliary pixels to their training values, we demonstrate that the vulnerability stems almost entirely from the inserted dimensions. The projection effectively neutralizes the attacks and restores robustness, revealing that the model achieves high accuracy by creating \\emph{sharp boundaries} (steep loss gradients) specifically along the auxiliary axes. Our findings provide a concrete geometric explanation for the accuracy-robustness paradox: the optimization landscape deepens the basin of attraction to improve accuracy but inevitably erects steep walls along the auxiliary degrees of freedom, creating a fragile sensitivity to off-manifold perturbations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uae4a\uc740 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \uae68\ub057\ud55c \uc815\ud655\uc131\uacfc \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uac15\uac74\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \uc6d0\uc778\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd\uc5d0\uc11c \uae68\ub057\ud55c \uc815\ud655\uc131\uacfc \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uac15\uac74\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ub4dc\uc624\ud504 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0 \uadf8 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \uae30\uc6d0\uc744 \ubc1d\ud788\uace0\uc790 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub300\uce6d \ud30c\uad34 \ucc28\uc6d0 \ud655\uc7a5(SBDE)\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc785\ub825 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub97c \uc0c1\uc218\uac12 \ud53d\uc140\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 \ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ub4dc\uc624\ud504\uc758 \uae30\uc804\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "SBDE\ub294 CIFAR-10\uc5d0\uc11c ResNet-18\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c 90.47%\uc5d0\uc11c 95.63%\ub85c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \ud654\uc774\ud2b8\ubc15\uc2a4 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc740 \uac10\uc18c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc640 \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc758 \uc5ed\uc124\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc778 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc5ec, \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ub79c\ub4dc\uc2a4\ucf00\uc774\ud504\uac00 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \uae4a\uc740 \ub9e4\ub825\uc744 \ud615\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ubcf4\uc870 \uc790\uc720\ub3c4 \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \uae09\uaca9\ud55c \ubcbd\uc744 \uc138\uc6b0\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uccad\uc815 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uacfc \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uac15\uac74\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ub4dc\uc624\ud504\ub294 \uc2ec\uce35 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub9cc\uc5f0\ud55c \ud604\uc0c1\uc774\uba70, \uadf8 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \uae30\uc6d0\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ubd88\uba85\ud655\ud558\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub300\uce6d \ud30c\uad34 \ucc28\uc6d0 \ud655\uc7a5(SBDE)\uc744 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub41c \ud0d0\uce68\uc73c\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 \ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ub4dc\uc624\ud504\uc758 \uae30\uc804\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4.

Although this has led to significant progress in domains such as robotics, healthcare, and finance, the use of RL in practice is challenging, particularly when learning decision policies in high-stakes applications that may require guarantees. Traditional RL algorithms rely on a large number of online interactions with the environment, which is problematic in scenarios where online interactions are costly, dangerous, or infeasible. However, learning from offline datasets is hindered by the presence of hidden confounders. Such confounders can cause spurious correlations in the dataset and can mislead the agent into taking suboptimal or adversarial actions. Firstly, we address the problem of learning from offline datasets in the presence of hidden confounders. We work with instrumental variables (IVs) to identify the causal effect, which is an instance of a conditional moment restrictions (CMR) problem. Inspired by double/debiased machine learning, we derive a sample-efficient algorithm for solving CMR problems with convergence and optimality guarantees, which outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms. Secondly, we relax the conditions on the hidden confounders in the setting of (offline) imitation learning, and adapt our CMR estimator to derive an algorithm that can learn effective imitator policies with convergence rate guarantees. Finally, we consider the problem of learning high-level objectives expressed in linear temporal logic (LTL) and develop a provably optimal learning algorithm that improves sample efficiency over existing methods.

With the success of neural networks on such large-scale problems, more research in machine learning is being conducted now than ever before. This dissertation focuses on three different projects rooted in mathematical theory for machine learning applications.\n  The first project deals with supervised learning and manifold learning. In theory, one of the main problems in supervised learning is that of function approximation: that is, given some data set $\\mathcal{D}=\\{(x_j,f(x_j))\\}_{j=1}^M$, can one build a model $F\\approx f$? We introduce a method which aims to remedy several of the theoretical shortcomings of the current paradigm for supervised learning.\n  The second project deals with transfer learning, which is the study of how an approximation process or model learned on one domain can be leveraged to improve the approximation on another domain. We study such liftings of functions when the data is assumed to be known only on a part of the whole domain. We are interested in determining subsets of the target data space on which the lifting can be defined, and how the local smoothness of the function and its lifting are related.\n  The third project is concerned with the classification task in machine learning, particularly in the active learning paradigm. Classification has often been treated as an approximation problem as well, but we propose an alternative approach leveraging techniques originally introduced for signal separation problems. We introduce theory to unify signal separation with classification and a new algorithm which yields competitive accuracy to other recent active learning algorithms while providing results much faster.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uba38\uc2e0 \ub7ec\ub2dd\uc758 \uc218\ud559\uc801 \uc774\ub860\uc5d0 \uadfc\uac70\ud55c \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud504\ub85c\uc81d\ud2b8\uc5d0

Recent work has explored LLM-based agentic frameworks to automatically construct mechanistic models from data; however, existing problem settings substantially oversimplify real-world conditions, leaving it unclear whether LLM-generated mechanistic models are reliable in practice. To address this gap, we introduce the Neural-Integrated Mechanistic Modeling (NIMM) evaluation framework, which evaluates LLM-generated mechanistic models under realistic settings with partial observations and diversified task objectives. Our evaluation reveals fundamental challenges in current baselines, ranging from model effectiveness to code-level correctness. Motivated by these findings, we design NIMMgen, an agentic framework for neural-integrated mechanistic modeling that enhances code correctness and practical validity through iterative refinement. Experiments across three datasets from diversified scientific domains demonstrate its strong performance. We also show that the learned mechanistic models support counterfactual intervention simulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc801 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c LLM \uc0dd\uc131 \uae30\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c NIMMgen \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ud655\ubcf4\ud558\uace0 \uc2e4\uc81c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "Neural-Integrated Mechanistic Modeling(NIMM) \ud3c9\uac00 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec LLM\uc774 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c \uae30\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ubd80\ubd84 \uad00\uce21 \ubc0f \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5 \ubaa9\ud45c \ud558\uc5d0 \ud3c9\uac00\ud568.", "result": "\ud604\uc7ac \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa8\ub378 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131 \ubc0f \ucf54\ub4dc \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ubc1c\uacac\ub418\uc5c8\uc74c.", "conclusion": "NIMMgen \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc815\ud655\uc131\uacfc \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801 \uc720\ud6a8\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba70, \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uacfc\ud559 \ubd84\uc57c\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uae30\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ud558\uba70, \ud558\uc704 \uacfc\ud559 \ubc0f \uc815\ucc45 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0\uc11c \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c LLM \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud0d0\uad6c\ud588\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874 \ubb38\uc81c \uc124\uc815\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc0c1\ud669\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ub2e8\uc21c\ud654\ud558\uc5ec LLM \uc0dd\uc131 \uae30\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc2e4\uc81c\ub85c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud558\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4ed\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubd80\ubd84 \uad00\uce21 \ubc0f \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uac16\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c LLM \uc0dd\uc131 \uae30\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 Neural-Integrated Mechanistic Modeling(NIMM) \ud3c9\uac00 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00\ub294 \ud604\uc7ac \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\ubd80\ud130 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc5d0 \uc774\ub974\uae30\uae4c\uc9c0 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc1c\uacac\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ub3d9\uae30\ub97c \ubd80\uc5ec\ubc1b\uc544, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc815\ud655\uc131\uacfc \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801 \uc720\ud6a8\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc2e0\uacbd \ud1b5\ud569 \uae30\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 NIMMgen\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uacfc\ud559 \ubd84\uc57c\uc758 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc740 \uadf8\uc758 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \uae30\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ubc18\uc0ac\uc2e4\uc801 \uac1c\uc785 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

To handle such complex and multi-modal datasets, in this paper, we propose Flow Actor-Critic, a new actor-critic method for offline RL, based on recent flow policies. The proposed method not only uses the flow model for actor as in previous flow policies but also exploits the expressive flow model for conservative critic acquisition to prevent Q-value explosion in out-of-data regions. To this end, we propose a new form of critic regularizer based on the flow behavior proxy model obtained as a byproduct of flow-based actor design.

However, strict equivariance can increase computational cost due to added architectural constraints, and can slow down convergence because the model must be consistent across a large space of possible node permutations. We study this trade-off for graph generative models. Specifically, we start from an equivariant discrete flow-matching model, and relax its equivariance during training via a controllable symmetry modulation scheme based on sinusoidal positional encodings and node permutations. Experiments first show that symmetry-breaking can accelerate early training by providing an easier learning signal, but at the expense of encouraging shortcut solutions that can cause overfitting, where the model repeatedly generates graphs that are duplicates of the training set. On the contrary, properly modulating the symmetry signal can delay overfitting while accelerating convergence, allowing the model to reach stronger performance with $19\\%$ of the baseline training epochs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \ub4f1\uac00\uc131\uc740 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc758 \uce58\ud658 \ub300\uce6d\uc744 \uc874\uc911\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \ub4f1\uac00\uc131\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801 \ub300\uce6d \uc870\uc808 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud6c8\ub828 \uc911 \ub4f1\uac00\uc131\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uacfc\uc801\ud569\uc744 \ubc29\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc218\ub834 \uc18d\ub3c4\ub97c \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc5bb\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ub4f1\uac00\uc131\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub098, \uc774\ub294 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uacfc \uc218\ub834 \uc18d\ub3c4\uc5d0 \ubd80\ub2f4\uc744 \uc904 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc2e0\ud638 \ub300\uce6d \uc870\uc808 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud6c8\ub828 \uc911 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ub4f1\uac00\uc131\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub300\uce6d \ud30c\uad34\ub294 \ucd08\uae30 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uacfc\uc801\ud569\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc801\uc808\ud55c \ub300\uce6d \uc2e0\ud638 \uc870\uc808\uc740 \uacfc\uc801\ud569\uc744 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba74\uc11c \uc218\ub834 \uc18d\ub3c4\ub97c \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uae30\ucd08 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc5d0\ud3ed\uc758 19%\ub85c \ub354 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc131\uacfc\uc5d0 \ub3c4\ub2ec\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub4f1\uac00\uc131\uc740 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c, \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc758 \uce58\ud658 \ub300\uce6d\uc744 \uc874\uc911\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \ub4f1\uac00\uc131\uc740 \ucd94\uac00\uc801\uc778 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc81c\uc57d\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub178\ub4dc \uce58\ud658\uc758 \ud070 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud574\uc57c \ud558\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc218\ub834 \uc18d\ub3c4\ub97c \uc800\ud558\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ub4dc \uc624\ud504\ub97c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \ub4f1\uac00\uc801\uc778 \uc774\uc0b0 \ud750\ub984 \uc77c\uce58 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\uc791\ud558\uc5ec, \uc0ac\uc778\ud615 \uc704\uce58 \uc778\ucf54\ub529 \ubc0f \ub178\ub4dc \uce58\ud658\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uc81c\uc5b4 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub300\uce6d \uc870\uc808 \uccb4\uacc4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc911 \ub4f1\uac00\uc131\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc740 \ub300\uce6d \ud30c\uad34\uac00 \ucd08\uae30 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \ub354 \uc26c\uc6b4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud6c8\ub828 \uc138\ud2b8\uc758 \uc911\ubcf5 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uacfc\uc801\ud569\uc744 \uc720\ubc1c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \ubc18\ub300\ub85c, \ub300\uce6d \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc801\uc808\ud788 \uc870\uc808\ud558\uba74 \uacfc\uc801\ud569\uc744 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba74\uc11c \uc218\ub834 \uc18d\ub3c4\ub97c \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc5b4, \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uae30\ucd08 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc5d0\ud3ed\uc758 19%\ub85c \ub354 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4."}}

While they have shown strong performance in offline RL, particularly where the target distribution is well defined, their extension to online fine-tuning has largely been treated as a direct continuation of offline pre-training, leaving key challenges unaddressed. In this paper, we propose Flow Matching with Injected Noise for Offline-to-Online RL (FINO), a novel method that leverages flow matching-based policies to enhance sample efficiency for offline-to-online RL. FINO facilitates effective exploration by injecting noise into policy training, thereby encouraging a broader range of actions beyond those observed in the offline dataset. In addition to exploration-enhanced flow policy training, we combine an entropy-guided sampling mechanism to balance exploration and exploitation, allowing the policy to adapt its behavior throughout online fine-tuning. Experiments across diverse, challenging tasks demonstrate that FINO consistently achieves superior performance under limited online budgets.", "AI": {"tldr": "FINO\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uc628\ub77c\uc778\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud750\ub984 \uc77c\uce58\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc815\ucc45 \ud6c8\ub828\uc5d0 \ub178\uc774\uc988\ub97c \uc8fc\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \ud0d0\uc0ac\ub97c \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\uace0, \ubc14\ub78c\uc9c1\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \uc720\ub3c4 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ud2b9\ud788 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 RL\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \ud655\uc7a5\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc8fc\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "FLOW Matching with Injected Noise for Offline-to-Online RL (FINO) \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud750\ub984 \uc77c\uce58\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uace0, \uc815\ucc45 \ud6c8\ub828\uc5d0 \ub178\uc774\uc988\ub97c \uc8fc\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \ud0d0\uc0ac\ub97c \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud558\uace0 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc778 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 FINO\uac00 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uc608\uc0b0 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "FINO\ub294 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 RL \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc628\ub77c\uc778\uc73c\ub85c \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\uc804\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uc5ec, \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc778\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ucd5c\uadfc \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub180\ub77c\uc6b4 \uc131\uacf5\uc744 \uac70\ub450\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc5d0\uc11c \ud45c\ud604\ub825\uc774 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc815\ucc45\uc73c\ub85c \ucc44\ud0dd\ub418\ub294 \ub3d9\uae30\ub97c \ubd80\uc5ec\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub4e4\uc740 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 RL\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \ud655\uc7a5\uc740 \uc8fc\ub85c \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\uc758 \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc778 \uc5f0\uc18d\uc73c\ub85c \uac04\uc8fc\ub418\uc5b4 \uc8fc\uc694 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ud574\uacb0\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uc628\ub77c\uc778 RL(OFFLINE-to-ONLINE RL)\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub178\uc774\uc988 \uc8fc\uc785 \ud750\ub984 \uc77c\uce58(FLOW Matching with Injected Noise, FINO)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

Existing physics-informed graph neural solvers typically rely on full fine-tuning for cross-regime transfer, incurring high retraining cost and offering limited control over the stability-plasticity trade-off between target-domain adaptation and source-domain retention. We study parameter-efficient domain adaptation for physics-informed self-attention based GNN, encouraging Kirchhoff-consistent behavior via a physics-based loss while restricting adaptation to low-rank updates. Specifically, we apply LoRA to attention projections with selective unfreezing of the prediction head to regulate adaptation capacity. This design yields a controllable efficiency-accuracy trade-off for physics-constrained inverse estimation under voltage-regime shift. Across multiple grid topologies, the proposed LoRA+PHead adaptation recovers near-full fine-tuning accuracy with a target-domain RMSE gap of $2.6\\times10^{-4}$ while reducing the number of trainable parameters by 85.46%. The physics-based residual remains comparable to full fine-tuning; however, relative to Full FT, LoRA+PHead reduces MV source retention by 4.7 percentage points (17.9% vs. 22.6%) under domain shift,

Code available at: https://github.com/joshrosie/FACT29", "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant potential in multi-agent negotiation tasks, yet evaluation in this domain remains challenging due to a lack of robust and generalizable benchmarks. Abdelnabi et al. (2024) introduce a negotiation benchmark based on Scoreable Games, with the aim of developing a highly complex and realistic evaluation framework for LLMs. Our work investigates the reproducibility of claims in their benchmark, and provides a deeper understanding of its usability and generalizability. We replicate the original experiments on additional models, and introduce additional metrics to verify negotiation quality and evenness of evaluation. Our findings reveal that while the benchmark is indeed complex, model comparison is ambiguous, raising questions about its objectivity. Furthermore, we identify limitations in the experimental setup, particularly in information leakage detection and thoroughness of the ablation study. By examining and analyzing the behavior of a wider range of models on an extended version of the benchmark, we reveal insights that provide additional context to potential users. Our results highlight the importance of context in model-comparative evaluations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud611\uc0c1 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\ub294 \ubc18\uba74, \ud3c9\uac00\uac00 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \uc774\uc720\ub294 \uacac\uace0\ud558\uace0 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uae30\uc900\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 LLM\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud558\uace0 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \ud3c9\uac00 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud558\uba70, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc758 \uc7ac\ud604 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6d0\ub798\uc758 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ucd94\uac00 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ubcf5\uc81c\ud558\uace0, \ud611\uc0c1 \ud488\uc9c8\uacfc \ud3c9\uac00\uc758 \uade0\uc77c\uc131\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ucd94\uac00 \uc9c0\ud45c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uae30\uc900\uc774 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud558\uae34 \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubaa8\ub378 \uac04 \ube44\uad50\uac00 \ubaa8\ud638\ud558\uc5ec \uac1d\uad00\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc758\ubb38\uc774 \uc81c\uae30\ub41c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uc124\uc815\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud655\uc778\ud558\uace0, \ub354 \ub9ce\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc5ec \uc7a0\uc7ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc5d0\uac8c \ucd94\uac00\uc801\uc778 \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud611\uc0c1 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uac15\ub825\ud558\uace0 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uae30\uc900\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 \ubd84\uc57c\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00\ub294 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc5b4\ub835\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Macke", "Daniel Gedon"], "title": "A Probabilistic Framework for LLM-Based Model Discovery", "comment": null, "summary": "Automated methods for discovering mechanistic simulator models from observational data offer a promising path toward accelerating scientific progress. Such methods often take the form of agentic-style iterative workflows that repeatedly propose and revise candidate models by imitating human discovery processes. However, existing LLM-based approaches typically implement such workflows via hand-crafted heuristic procedures, without an explicit probabilistic formulation. We recast model discovery as probabilistic inference, i.e., as sampling from an unknown distribution over mechanistic models capable of explaining the data. This perspective provides a unified way to reason about model proposal, refinement, and selection within a single inference framework. As a concrete instantiation of this view, we introduce ModelSMC, an algorithm based on Sequential Monte Carlo sampling. ModelSMC represents candidate models as particles which are iteratively proposed and refined by an LLM, and weighted using likelihood-based criteria. Experiments on real-world scientific systems illustrate that this formulation discovers models with interpretable mechanisms and improves posterior predictive checks.

Such heterogeneity allows dense objectives to dominate learning, while sparse long-horizon rewards receive weak credit assignment, leading to poor sample efficiency. We propose a Parallel Reward Integration with Symmetry (PRISM) algorithm that enforces reflectional symmetry as an inductive bias in aligning reward channels. PRISM introduces ReSymNet, a theory-motivated model that reconciles temporal-frequency mismatches across objectives, using residual blocks to learn a scaled opportunity value that accelerates exploration while preserving the optimal policy. We also propose SymReg, a reflectional equivariance regulariser that enforces agent mirroring and constrains policy search to a reflection-equivariant subspace. This restriction provably reduces hypothesis complexity and improves generalisation. Across MuJoCo benchmarks, PRISM consistently outperforms both a sparse-reward baseline and an oracle trained with full dense rewards, improving Pareto coverage and distributional balance: it achieves hypervolume gains exceeding 100\\% over the baseline and up to 32\\% over the oracle.

While these innovations yield significant performance gains, they compromise the identity mapping property of residual connections, leading to training instability, limited scalability, and increased memory overhead. To address these challenges, we propose JPmHC (Jacobian-spectrum Preserving manifold-constrained Hyper-Connections), a framework that replaces identity skips with a trainable linear mixer acting on n parallel streams while explicitly controlling gradient conditioning. By constraining the mixer M on operator-norm-bounded manifolds (e.g., bistochastic, Stiefel, Grassmann), JPmHC prevents gradient pathologies and enhances stability. JPmHC introduces three key contributions: (i) a free-probability analysis that predicts Jacobian spectra for structured skips, providing actionable design rules for mixer selection; (ii) memory-efficient implicit differentiation for fixed-point projections, reducing activation memory and synchronization overhead; and (iii) a Stiefel-constrained mixer via Cayley transforms, ensuring orthogonality without post-hoc normalization. Empirical evaluations on ARC-AGI demonstrate that JPmHC achieves faster convergence, higher accuracy, and lower computational cost compared to bistochastic baselines. As a flexible and scalable extension of HC, JPmHC advances spectrum-aware, stable, and efficient deep learning, offering insights into topological architecture design and foundational model evolution.", "AI": {"tldr": "JPmHC\ub294 \ube44\uc2b7\ud55c \uc794\uc5ec \uc5f0\uacb0\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uba70 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc2ec\uce35 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2ec\uce35 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \uc794\uc5ec \uc5f0\uacb0\uc758 \uc815\uccb4\uc131 \ub9e4\ud551 \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \uc800\ud574\ud558\uc5ec \ud559\uc2b5 \ubd88\uc548\uc815\uc131\uacfc \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "JPmHC\ub294 n\uac1c\uc758 \ubcd1\ub82c \uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9bc\uc5d0 \uc791\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ud559\uc2b5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc120\ud615 \ubbf9\uc11c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\uccb4\uc131 \uac74\ub108\ub6f0\uae30\ub97c \ub300\uccb4\ud558\uace0, \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uc870\uac74\uc744 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uc5b4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "JPmHC\ub294 ARC-AGI\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874\uc758 bistochastic \uae30\uc900\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \ube60\ub978 \uc218\ub834, \ub192\uc740 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4, \ub0ae\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "JPmHC\ub294 \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc \uc778\uc2dd, \uc548\uc815\uc131 \ubc0f \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5\ub41c HC\ub85c, \ud1a0\ud3f4\ub85c\uc9c0 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \ub514\uc790\uc778 \ubc0f \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378 \ubc1c\uc804\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc\uc758 \ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd \ubc1c\uc804, \ud2b9\ud788 \ud558\uc774\ud37c \uc5f0\uacb0(HC)\ub85c \uc608\uc2dc\ub418\ub294 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub354 \ub113\uc740 \uc794\uc5ec \ud750\ub984\uacfc \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc5f0\uacb0 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc794\uc5ec \uc5f0\uacb0 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \ud655\uc7a5\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud601\uc2e0\uc740 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uac00\uc838\uc624\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc794\uc5ec \uc5f0\uacb0\uc758 \uc815\uccb4\uc131 \ub9e4\ud551 \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \uc800\ud574\ud558\uc5ec \ud559\uc2b5 \ubd88\uc548\uc815\uc131, \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ud655\uc7a5\uc131, \uc99d\uac00\ub41c \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 JPmHC(\uc57c\ucf54\ube44\uc548 \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc \ubcf4\uc874 \ub9e4\ub2c8\ud3f4\ub4dc \uc81c\uc57d \ud558\uc774\ud37c \uc5f0\uacb0) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

While these systems often achieve strong performance, their recommendations are often difficult to justify: the influence of dataset meta-features on algorithm and hyperparameter choices is typically not exposed, limiting reliability, bias diagnostics, and efficient meta-feature engineering. This limits reliability and diagnostic insight for further improvements. In this work, we investigate the explainability of the meta-models in AutoClustering. We first review 22 existing methods and organize their meta-features into a structured taxonomy. We then apply a global explainability technique (i.e., Decision Predicate Graphs) to assess feature importance within meta-models from selected frameworks. Finally, we use local explainability tools such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to analyse specific clustering decisions. Our findings highlight consistent patterns in meta-feature relevance, identify structural weaknesses in current meta-learning strategies that can distort recommendations, and provide actionable guidance for more interpretable Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) design. This study therefore offers a practical foundation for increasing decision transparency in unsupervised learning automation.", "AI": {"tldr": "AutoClustering \ubc29\ubc95\uc758
