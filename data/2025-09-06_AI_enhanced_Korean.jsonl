However, empirical\nstudies of judicial panels are constrained by significant ethical and practical\nbarriers. This paper introduces SAMVAD, an innovative Multi-Agent System (MAS)\ndesigned to simulate the deliberation process within the framework of the\nIndian justice system.\n  Our system comprises agents representing key judicial roles: a Judge, a\nProsecution Counsel, a Defense Counsel, and multiple Adjudicators (simulating a\njudicial bench), all powered by large language models (LLMs). A primary\ncontribution of this work is the integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n(RAG), grounded in a domain-specific knowledge base of landmark Indian legal\ndocuments, including the Indian Penal Code and the Constitution of India. This\nRAG functionality enables the Judge and Counsel agents to generate legally\nsound instructions and arguments, complete with source citations, thereby\nenhancing both the fidelity and transparency of the simulation.\n  The Adjudicator agents engage in iterative deliberation rounds, processing\ncase facts, legal instructions, and arguments to reach a consensus-based\nverdict. We detail the system architecture, agent communication protocols, the\nRAG pipeline, the simulation workflow, and a comprehensive evaluation plan\ndesigned to assess performance, deliberation quality, and outcome consistency.\n  This work provides a configurable and explainable MAS platform for exploring\nlegal reasoning and group decision-making dynamics in judicial simulations,\nspecifically tailored to the Indian legal context and augmented with verifiable\nlegal grounding via RAG.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc778\ub3c4 \uc0ac\ubc95 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c

However, their potential is often limited by the\nfinite complexity and implicit biases of hand-crafted training environments. To\ndevelop truly generalizable and robust agents, we need environments that scale\nin complexity alongside the agents learning within them. In this work, we\nreframe the challenge of environment generation as the problem of learning a\ngoal-conditioned, generative world model. We propose a system where a\ngenerative **Attacker** agent learns an implicit world model to synthesize\nincreasingly difficult challenges for a team of cooperative **Defender**\nagents. The Attacker's objective is not passive prediction, but active,\ngoal-driven interaction: it models and generates world states (i.e.,\nconfigurations of enemy units) specifically to exploit the Defenders'\nweaknesses. Concurrently, the embodied Defender team learns a cooperative\npolicy to overcome these generated worlds. This co-evolutionary dynamic creates\na self-scaling curriculum where the world model continuously adapts to\nchallenge the decision-making policy of the agents, providing an effectively\ninfinite stream of novel and relevant training scenarios. We demonstrate that\nthis framework leads to the emergence of complex behaviors, such as the world\nmodel learning to generate flanking and shielding formations, and the defenders\nlearning coordinated focus-fire and spreading tactics. Our findings position\nadversarial co-evolution as a powerful method for learning instrumental world\nmodels that drive agents toward greater strategic depth and robustness.", "AI": {"tldr":

These frameworks typically focus on macro-level orchestration while\noverlooking agents' internal deliberative capabilities. This critical\nmeta-cognitive blindspot treats agents as passive executors unable to adapt\ntheir strategy based on internal cognitive states like uncertainty or\nconfidence. We introduce the Meta-Policy Deliberation Framework (MPDF), where\nagents learn a decentralized policy over a set of high-level meta-cognitive\nactions: Persist, Refine, and Concede. To overcome the instability of\ntraditional policy gradients in this setting, we develop SoftRankPO, a novel\nreinforcement learning algorithm. SoftRankPO stabilizes training by shaping\nadvantages based on the rank of rewards mapped through smooth normal quantiles,\nmaking the learning process robust to reward variance. Experiments show that\nMPDF with SoftRankPO achieves a a 4-5% absolute gain in average accuracy across\nfive mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks compared to six\nstate-of-the-art heuristic and learning-based multi-agent reasoning algorithms.\nOur work presents a paradigm for learning adaptive, meta-cognitive policies for\nmulti-agent LLM systems, shifting the focus from designing fixed protocols to\nlearning dynamic, deliberative strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "MPDF\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uba54\ud0c0 \uc778\uc9c0 \uc815\ucc45 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \ud611\ub825\uc801 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ub3c4\ubaa8\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uacf5\ub3d9 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc740 LLM\ub4e4\uc774 \uc9c0\ub2cc \ub0b4\ubd80 \uc0ac\uace0 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubb34\uc2dc\ud558\ubbc0\ub85c, \uc774\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "Meta-Policy Deliberation Framework(MPDF)\uc640 SoftRankPO\ub77c\ub294 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uba54\ud0c0 \uc778\uc9c0 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "MPDF\uc640 SoftRankPO\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud3c9\uade0 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc5d0\uc11c 4-5%\uc758 \uc808\ub300\uc801 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc801\uc751\ud615 \uba54\ud0c0 \uc778\uc9c0 \uc815\ucc45 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0\uc11c \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub4e4\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub294 \uace0\uc815\ub41c \ud611\ub825 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc81c\ud55c\ub418\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub9e4\ud06c\ub85c \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc624\ucf00\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ub0b4\ubd80 \uc2ec\uc0ac \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac04\uacfc\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uba54\ud0c0 \uc778\uc9c0\uc801 \ube14\ub77c\uc778\ub4dc \uc2a4\ud31f\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc774\ub098 \uc790\uc2e0\uac10\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ub0b4\ubd80 \uc778\uc9c0 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc218\ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \uc2e4\ud589\uc790\ub85c \ucde8\uae09\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 Persist, Refine, Concede\ub77c\ub294 \uace0\uc218\uc900\uc758 \uba54\ud0c0 \uc778\uc9c0 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc9d1\ud569\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \uba54\ud0c0 \uc815\ucc45 \uc2ec\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c(MPDF)\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc815\ucc45 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30\uc758 \ubd88\uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \ubd80\ub4dc\ub7ec\uc6b4 \uc815\uaddc \ubd84\ud3ec\uc758 \ubd84\uc704\uc218\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ub9e4\ud551\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\uc810\uc744 \ud615\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \ud559\uc2b5 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubd84\uc0b0\uc5d0 \uac15\ud558\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4dc\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 SoftRankPO\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, MPDF\uc640 SoftRankPO\ub294 6\uac1c\uc758 \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uce58\uc6b0\uce5c \ubc0f \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc18 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ucd94\ub860 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec 5\uac1c\uc758 \uc218\ud559\uc801 \ubc0f \uc77c\ubc18\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uade0 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc5d0\uc11c 4-5%\uc758 \uc808\ub300\uc801 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc791\uc5c5\uc740 \uace0\uc815 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c \uc124\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \ub3d9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc2ec\uc0ac\uc801\uc778 \uc804\ub7b5 \ud559\uc2b5\uc73c\ub85c \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \uc774\ub3d9\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 LLM \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uba54\ud0c0 \uc778\uc9c0 \uc815\ucc45 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

We show that such personality priming yields consistent,\ninterpretable behavioral biases across diverse tasks: emotionally expressive\nagents excel in narrative generation, while analytically primed agents adopt\nmore stable strategies in game-theoretic settings. Our framework supports\nexperimenting with structured multi-agent communication protocols and reveals\nthat self-reflection prior to interaction improves cooperation and reasoning\nquality.

Therefore, we\ndesign an automated pipeline to transform the sequential episodes into page\ngraphs, which explicitly model the graph structure of the pages that are\nnaturally connected by actions. To fully utilize the page graphs, we further\nintroduce Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology to effectively\nretrieve reliable perception guidelines of GUI from them, and a

Our approach integrates the transformer\narchitecture for forecasting of renewable generation and a proximal-policy\noptimization (PPO) agent to make decisions in a simulated environment. Our\nexperimental results demonstrate significant improvements in both energy\nefficiency and operational resilience when compared to traditional rule-based\nmethods.

Although Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers a promising\npathway for CD&R automation, existing approaches commonly suffer from a\n\"unimodal bias\" in their policies. This leads to a critical lack of\ndecision-making flexibility when confronted with complex and dynamic\nconstraints, often resulting in \"decision deadlocks.\" To overcome this\nlimitation, this paper pioneers the integration of diffusion probabilistic\nmodels into the safety-critical task of CD&R, proposing a novel autonomous\nconflict resolution framework named Diffusion-AC. Diverging from conventional\nmethods that converge to a single optimal solution, our framework models its\npolicy as a reverse denoising process guided by a value function, enabling it\nto generate a rich, high-quality, and multimodal action distribution. This core\narchitecture is complemented by a Density-Progressive Safety Curriculum (DPSC),\na training mechanism that ensures stable and efficient learning as the agent\nprogresses from sparse to high-density traffic environments. Extensive\nsimulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly\noutperforms a suite of state-of-the-art DRL benchmarks. Most critically, in the\nmost challenging high-density scenarios, Diffusion-AC not only maintains a high\nsuccess rate of 94.1% but also reduces the incidence of Near Mid-Air Collisions\n(NMACs) by approximately 59% compared to the next-best-performing baseline,\nsignificantly enhancing the system's safety margin. This performance leap stems\nfrom its unique multimodal decision-making capability, which allows the agent\nto flexibly switch to effective alternative maneuvers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8

Beginning with\nfoundational work and progressing to landmark achievements such as AlphaStar in\nStarCraft II and OpenAI Five in Dota 2, MARL has proven capable of achieving\nsuperhuman performance across diverse game environments through techniques like\nself-play, supervised learning, and deep reinforcement learning. With its\ngrowing impact, a comprehensive review has become increasingly important in\nthis field. This paper aims to provide a thorough examination of MARL's\napplication from turn-based two-agent games to real-time multi-agent video\ngames including popular genres such as Sports games, First-Person Shooter (FPS)\ngames, Real-Time Strategy (RTS) games and Multiplayer Online Battle Arena\n(MOBA) games. We further analyze critical challenges posed by MARL in video\ngames, including nonstationary, partial observability, sparse rewards, team\ncoordination, and scalability, and highlight successful implementations in\ngames like Rocket League, Minecraft, Quake III Arena, StarCraft II, Dota 2,\nHonor of Kings, etc. This paper offers insights into MARL in video game AI\nsystems, proposes a novel

Failing to\naddress these issues can result in unauthorized access, privilege escalation,\nand lateral movement within clusters. Most existing K8s security solutions\nfocus on detecting misconfigurations, typically through static analysis or\nanomaly detection. In contrast, this paper presents KubeGuard, a novel runtime\nlog-driven recommender framework aimed at mitigating risks by addressing overly\npermissive configurations. KubeGuard is designed to harden K8s environments\nthrough two complementary tasks: Resource Creation and Resource Refinement.

In agentic\nsettings, existing methods like ReAct prompt LLMs to explicitly plan before\nevery action; however, we demonstrate that always planning is computationally\nexpensive and degrades performance on long-horizon tasks, while never planning\nfurther limits performance. To address this, we introduce a conceptual\nframework formalizing dynamic planning for LLM agents, enabling them to\nflexibly decide when to allocate test-time compute for planning. We propose a\nsimple two-stage training pipeline: (1) supervised fine-tuning on diverse\nsynthetic data to prime models for dynamic planning, and (2) RL to refine this\ncapability in long-horizon environments.

As these models continued to grow, leveraging geo-distributed data\nfrom wireless devices has become increasingly critical, giving rise to\nfederated foundation models (FFMs). More recently, FMs have evolved into\nmulti-modal multi-task (M3T) FMs (e.g., GPT-4) capable of processing diverse\nmodalities across multiple tasks, which motivates a new underexplored paradigm:\nM3T FFMs. In this paper, we unveil an unexplored variation of M3T FFMs by\nproposing hierarchical federated foundation models (HF-FMs), which in turn\nexpose two overlooked heterogeneity dimensions to fog/edge networks that have a\ndirect impact on these emerging models: (i) heterogeneity in collected\nmodalities and (ii) heterogeneity in executed tasks across fog/edge nodes.\nHF-FMs strategically align the modular structure of M3T FMs, comprising\nmodality encoders, prompts, mixture-of-experts (MoEs), adapters, and task\nheads, with the hierarchical nature of fog/edge infrastructures. Moreover,\nHF-FMs enable the optional usage of device-to-device (D2D) communications,\nenabling horizontal module relaying and localized cooperative training among\nnodes when feasible. Through delving into the architectural design of HF-FMs,\nwe highlight their unique capabilities along with a series of tailored future\nresearch directions. Finally, to demonstrate their potential, we prototype\nHF-FMs in a wireless network setting and release the open-source code for the\ndevelopment of HF-FMs with the goal of fostering exploration in this untapped\nfield (GitHub: https://github.com/payamsiabd/M3T-FFM).", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc5f0\ud569 \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378(HF-FMs)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ub2e4\uc911 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc5f0\ud569 \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378(M3T FFMs)\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubcc0\ud615\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5f0\ud569 \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378(FFMs)\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ubc0f \ub2e4\uc911 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc778 M3T FFMs\uac00 \ub4f1\uc7a5\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc5f0\ud569 \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378(HF-FMs)\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc548\uac1c/\uc5e3\uc9c0 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131 \ucc28\uc6d0(\uc218\uc9d1\ub41c \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0 \ubc0f \uc2e4\ud589\ub41c \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131)\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "HF-FMs\ub294 M3T FMs\uc758 \ubaa8\ub4c8 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uc804\ub7b5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\ub82c\ud558\uace0, \uc7a5\uce58 \uac04(D2D) \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc218\ud3c9 \ubaa8\ub4c8 \uc911\uacc4 \ubc0f \uad6d\uc18c \ud611\ub825 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "HF-FMs\uc758 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uace0\uc720\ud55c \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uace0, \uc774 \ubd84\uc57c\uc758 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc624\ud508 \uc18c\uc2a4 \ucf54\ub4dc\ub97c \uacf5\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378(FMs)\uc758 \ubd80\uc0c1\uc740 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ud310\ub3c4\ub97c \ubcc0\ud654\uc2dc\ucf30\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uacc4\uc18d \uc131\uc7a5\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ubb34\uc120 \uc7a5\uce58\uc758 \uc9c0\ub9ac\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc0b0\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uc911\uc694\ud574\uc84c\uace0, \uc774\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc5f0\ud569 \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378(FFM)\uc774 \ub4f1\uc7a5\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc FMs\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\ub97c \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ub2e4\uc911 \uc791\uc5c5(M3T) FMs(\uc608: GPT-4)\ub85c \ubc1c\uc804\ud558\uc5ec \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubbf8\ud0d0\uc0ac \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc778 M3T FFMs\uc758 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc5f4\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc5f0\ud569 \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378(HF-FMs)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec M3T FFMs\uc758 \ubbf8\ud0d0\uc0ac \ubcc0\ud615\uc744 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b4\uace0, \uc774\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc2e0\ud765 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc778 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc548\uac1c/\uc5e3\uc9c0 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \uac04\uacfc\ub41c \uc774\uc9c8\uc131 \ucc28\uc6d0 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0(\uc218\uc9d1 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\uc758 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131 \ubc0f \uc548\uac1c/\uc5e3\uc9c0 \ub178\ub4dc \uac04\uc758 \uc2e4\ud589\ub41c \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131)\ub97c \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Latent Profiles for Social Simulation", "comment": "25 pages, 9 figures, 7 tables", "summary": "The impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have fueled the\nnotion that synthetic agents can serve as substitutes for real participants in\nhuman-subject research. In an effort to evaluate the merits of this claim,\nsocial science researchers have largely focused on whether LLM-generated survey\ndata corresponds to that of a human counterpart whom the LLM is prompted to\nrepresent. In contrast, we address a more fundamental question: Do agents\nmaintain internal consistency, retaining similar behaviors when examined under\ndifferent experimental settings? To this end, we develop a study designed to\n(a) reveal the agent's internal state and (b) examine agent behavior in a basic\ndialogue setting. This design enables us to explore a set of behavioral\nhypotheses to assess whether an agent's conversation behavior is consistent\nwith what we would expect from their revealed internal state. Our findings on\nthese hypotheses show significant internal inconsistencies in LLMs across model\nfamilies and at differing model sizes. Most importantly, we find that, although\nagents may generate responses matching those of their human counterparts, they\nfail to be internally consistent, representing a critical gap in their\ncapabilities to accurately substitute for real participants in human-subject\nresearch.

The movement of\nphysical products across different categories, from suppliers to warehouse\nmanagement, to sales, and logistics transporting them to customers, entails the\ninvolvement of many entities.

How to\ncollect relevant data from an e-commerce platform's perspective, formulate\nlong-term plans, and dynamically adjust them based on environmental changes,\nwhile ensuring interpretability, efficiency, and reliability, is a practical\nand challenging problem. In recent years, the development of AI technologies,\nespecially the rapid progress of large language models, has provided new tools\nto address real-world issues. In this work, we construct a Supply Chain\nPlanning Agent (SCPA) framework that can understand domain knowledge,\ncomprehend the operator's needs, decompose tasks, leverage or create new tools,\nand return evidence-based planning reports.

We present a\ngame-theoretic perspective on the Constant Potts Model (CPM) for partitioning\nnetworks into disjoint communities, emphasizing its efficiency, robustness, and\naccuracy. Efficiency: We reinterpret CPM as a potential hedonic game by\ndecomposing its global Hamiltonian into local utility functions, where the\nlocal utility gain of each agent matches the corresponding increase in global\nutility. Leveraging this equivalence, we prove that local optimization of the\nCPM objective via better-response dynamics converges in pseudo-polynomial time\nto an equilibrium partition. Robustness: We introduce and relate two stability\ncriteria: a strict criterion based on a novel notion of robustness, requiring\nnodes to simultaneously maximize neighbors and minimize non-neighbors within\ncommunities, and a relaxed utility function based on a weighted sum of these\nobjectives, controlled by a resolution parameter. Accuracy: In community\ntracking scenarios, where initial partitions are used to bootstrap the Leiden\nalgorithm with partial ground-truth information, our experiments reveal that\nrobust partitions yield higher accuracy in recovering ground-truth communities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ubd88\uc5f0\uc18d \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ud2f0\ub85c \ubd84\ud560\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c Constant Potts Model(CPM)\uc758 \uac8c\uc784 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uad00\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ud2f0 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uacfc\ud559\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ubb38\uc81c \uc911 \ud558\ub098\ub85c, \ub178\ub4dc\ub97c \ubd88\uc5f0\uc18d \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ud2f0\ub85c \ubd84\ud560\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "CPM\uc744 \uc9c0\uc5ed \ud6a8\uc6a9 \ud568\uc218\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ud574\ubc00\ud1a0\ub2c8\uc548\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\uc5ec \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \ucf8c\ub77d \uac8c\uc784\uc73c\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uc9c0\uc5ed \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uac00 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uade0\ud615 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub85c \uc218\ub834\ud558\ub294\uc9c0 \uc99d\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \ub85c\ubc84\uc2a4\ud2b8\ud55c \ubd84\ud560\uc774 \ucd08\uae30 \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc9c4\uc2e4 \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ud2f0 \ubcf5\uad6c\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub192\uc774\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ud2f0 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 CPM\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131, \uacac\uace0\uc131 \ubc0f \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ud2f0 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uacfc\ud559\uc758 \uae30\ubcf8 \ubb38\uc81c \uc911 \ud558\ub098\ub85c, \ub178\ub4dc\ub97c \ubd88\uc5f0\uc18d \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ud2f0\ub85c \ubd84\ud560\ud558\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131, \uacac\uace0\uc131 \ubc0f \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ubd88\uc5f0\uc18d \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ud2f0\ub85c \ubd84\ud560\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c Constant Potts Model (CPM)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac8c\uc784 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uad00\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud6a8\uc728\uc131: \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 CPM\uc744 \uc9c0\uc5ed \ud6a8\uc6a9 \ud568\uc218\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ud574\ubc00\ud1a0\ub2c8\uc548\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\uc5ec \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \ucf8c\ub77d \uac8c\uc784\uc73c\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uac01 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc9c0\uc5ed \ud6a8\uc6a9 \uc99d\uac00\uac00 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ud6a8\uc6a9\uc758 \uc99d\uac00\uc640 \uc77c\uce58\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub3d9\ub4f1\uc131\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 CPM \ubaa9\ud45c\uc758 \uc9c0\uc5ed \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uac00 \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc751\ub2f5 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc758\uc0ac \ub2e4\ud56d \uc2dc\uac04 \ub0b4\uc5d0 \uade0\ud615 \ubd84\ud560\ub85c \uc218\ub834\ud568\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacac\uace0\uc131: \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc548\uc815\uc131 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0 \uad00\ub828\uc9d3\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uc774\uc6c3 \ub178\ub4dc\ub97c \ucd5c\ub300\ud654\ud558\uace0 \ube44\uc774\uc6c3 \ub178\ub4dc\ub97c \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uac1c\ub150\uc758 \uacac\uace0\uc131\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \uae30\uc900\uacfc, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubaa9\ud45c\uc758 \uac00\uc911 \ud569\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \uc644\ud654\ub41c \ud6a8\uc6a9 \ud568\uc218\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc815\ud655\uc131: \ucd08\uae30 \ubd84\ud560\uc774 \ubd80\ubd84\uc801\uc778 \uc9c4\uc2e4 \uc815\ubcf4\uc640 \ud568\uaed8 Leiden \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ubd80\ud2b8\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub7a9\ud558\ub294 \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ud2f0 \ucd94\uc801 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \ub85c\ubc84\uc2a4\ud2b8\ud55c \ubd84\ud560\uc774 \uc9c4\uc2e4 \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ud2f0 \ubcf5\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Inverse reinforcement\nlearning (IRL) in mean field games (MFGs) offers a practical framework to infer\nreward functions from expert demonstrations. While promising, the assumption of\nagent homogeneity limits the capability of existing methods to handle\ndemonstrations with heterogeneous and unknown objectives, which are common in\npractice.

In this paper, we present TAGAL, a collection of methods able\nto generate synthetic tabular data using an agentic workflow. The methods\nleverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for an automatic and iterative process\nthat uses feedback to improve the generated data without any further LLM\ntraining. The use of LLMs also allows for the addition of external knowledge in\nthe generation process. We evaluate TAGAL across diverse datasets and different\naspects of quality for the generated data. We look at the utility of downstream\nML models, both by training classifiers on synthetic data only and by combining\nreal and synthetic data.

A Precision-Recall Approach to Dimensionality Reduction Validation", "comment": null, "summary": "Dimensionality Reduction (DR) is widely used for visualizing high-dimensional\ndata, often with the goal of revealing expected cluster structure. However,\nsuch a structure may not always appear in the projections. Existing DR quality\nmetrics assess projection reliability (to some extent) or cluster structure\nquality, but do not explain why expected structures are missing. Visual\nAnalytics solutions can help, but are often time-consuming due to the large\nhyperparameter space. This paper addresses this problem by leveraging a recent\nframework that divides the DR process into two phases: a relationship phase,\nwhere similarity relationships are modeled, and a mapping phase, where the data\nis projected accordingly. We introduce two supervised metrics, precision and\nrecall, to evaluate the relationship phase. These metrics quantify how well the\nmodeled relationships align with an expected cluster structure based on some\nset of labels representing this structure. We illustrate their application\nusing t-SNE and UMAP, and validate the approach through various usage\nscenarios. Our approach can guide hyperparameter tuning, uncover projection\nartifacts, and determine if the expected structure is captured in the\nrelationships, making the DR process faster and more

Understanding\nhow tourists perceive these environments is essential for sustainable,\nhuman-centered urban planning. This study proposes a multidimensional\nAI-powered framework for analyzing tourist perception in historic urban\nquarters using multimodal data from social media. Applied to twelve historic\nquarters in central Shanghai, the framework integrates focal point extraction,\ncolor theme analysis, and sentiment mining. Visual focus areas are identified\nfrom tourist-shared photos using a fine-tuned semantic segmentation model. To\nassess aesthetic preferences, dominant colors are extracted using a clustering\nmethod, and their spatial distribution across quarters is analyzed. Color\nthemes are further compared between social media photos and real-world street\nviews, revealing notable shifts. This divergence highlights potential gaps\nbetween visual expectations and the built environment, reflecting both\nstylistic preferences and perceptual bias. Tourist reviews are evaluated\nthrough a hybrid sentiment analysis approach combining a rule-based method and\na multi-task BERT model. Satisfaction is assessed across four dimensions:\ntourist activities, built environment, service facilities, and business\nformats. The results reveal spatial variations in aesthetic appeal and\nemotional response. Rather than focusing on a single technical innovation, this\nframework offers an integrated, data-driven approach to decoding tourist\nperception and contributes to informed decision-making in tourism, heritage\nconservation, and the design of aesthetically engaging public spaces.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uc2dc \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc740 \ubb38\ud654\uc720\uc0b0\uc744

The bias--variance tradeoff can be used to write the\nexpected mean squared error between a model distribution and a ground-truth\nrandom variable as the sum of an epistemic uncertainty term, the bias squared,\nand an aleatoric uncertainty term. We leverage this relationship to propose\nnovel active learning strategies that directly reduce the bias between\nexperimental rounds, considering model systems both with and without noise.\nFinally, we investigate methods to leverage historical data in a quadratic\nmanner through the use of a novel cobias--covariance relationship, which\nnaturally proposes a mechanism for batching through an eigendecomposition\nstrategy. When our difference-based method leveraging the cobias--covariance\nrelationship is utilized in a batched setting (with a quadratic estimator), we\noutperform a number of canonical methods including BALD and Least Confidence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774\ubd84\uc0b0 \uc6b0\uc5f0\uc801 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud65c\uc131 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \ub77c\uc6b4\ub4dc \uac04\uc758 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2e4\uc138\uacc4 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub294 \uc774\ubd84\uc0b0 \uc6b0\uc5f0\uc801 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc774 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\uba70, \uc774 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc740 \ubc30\uce58 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4\uac00 \uc788\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud3b8\ud5a5-\ubd84\uc0b0 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc640 \uc2e4\uc81c \ub79c\ub364 \ubcc0\uc218 \uac04\uc758 \uc608\uc0c1 \ud3c9\uade0 \uc81c\uacf1 \uc624\ucc28\ub97c \uc124\uba85\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud65c\uc131 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 BALD \ubc0f Least Confidence\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacf5\ubd84\uc0b0 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ubc30\uce58 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7fd\uac8c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc2e4\uc138\uacc4 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub294 \uc774\ubd84\uc0b0 \uc6b0\uc5f0\uc801 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc758 \uc874\uc7ac\uac00 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc774\uba70, \uc774 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc740 \ubc30\uce58 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uac00\uc9c8 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud3b8\ud5a5-\ubd84\uc0b0 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc640 \uc2e4\uc81c \ubb34\uc791\uc704 \ubcc0\uc218 \uac04\uc758 \uc608\uc0c1 \ud3c9\uade0 \uc81c\uacf1 \uc624\ucc28\ub97c \uc9c0\uc2dd \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ud56d, \ud3b8\ud5a5 \uc81c\uacf1, \uc6b0\uc5f0\uc801 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ud56d\uc758 \ud569\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0bc \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \ub77c\uc6b4\ub4dc \uac04\uc758 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud65c\uc131 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacf5\ubd84\uc0b0 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc774\ucc28\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uace0\uc720\ubd84\ud574 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \ubc30\uce58 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7fd\uac8c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ucc28\uc774 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ubc30\uce58 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub420 \ub54c, \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Traditional exploration methods like Novelty Search (NS) expand locally\nby mutating known novel solutions but often plateau when local novelty is\nexhausted, failing to reach distant, unexplored regions. We introduce\nExpedition and Expansion (E&E), a hybrid strategy where exploration alternates\nbetween local novelty-driven expansions and goal-directed expeditions. During\nexpeditions, E&E leverages a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to generate linguistic\ngoals--descriptions of interesting but hypothetical patterns that drive\nexploration toward uncharted regions. By operating in semantic spaces that\nalign with human perception, E&E both evaluates novelty and generates goals in\nconceptually meaningful ways, enhancing the interpretability and relevance of\ndiscovered behaviors. Tested on Flow Lenia, a continuous CA known for its rich,\nemergent behaviors, E&E consistently uncovers more diverse solutions than\nexisting exploration methods. A genealogical analysis further reveals that\nsolutions originating from expeditions disproportionately influence long-term\nexploration, unlocking new behavioral niches that serve as stepping stones for\nsubsequent search.

To address this gap, our paper highlights\nthe importance of the concept of data uncertainty for explaining the\neffectiveness of the recent tabular DL methods. In particular, we reveal that\nthe success of many beneficial design choices in tabular DL, such as numerical\nfeature embeddings, retrieval-augmented models and advanced ensembling\nstrategies, can be largely attributed to their implicit mechanisms for managing\nhigh data uncertainty.

This\nevolution presents a novel opportunity to address long-standing challenges in\ncomplex digital environments. Core tasks on Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C)\ne-commerce platforms often require users to navigate complex Graphical User\nInterfaces (GUIs), making the experience time-consuming for both buyers and\nsellers. This paper introduces a novel approach to simplify these interactions\nthrough an LLM-powered agentic assistant. This agent functions as a new,\nconversational entry point to the marketplace, shifting the primary interaction\nmodel from a complex GUI to an intuitive AI agent. By interpreting natural\nlanguage commands, the agent automates key high-friction workflows. For\nsellers, this includes simplified updating and renewal of listings, and the\nability to send bulk messages. For buyers, the agent facilitates a more\nefficient product discovery process through conversational search. We present\nthe architecture for Facebook Marketplace Assistant (FaMA), arguing that this\nagentic, conversational paradigm provides a lightweight and more accessible\nalternative to traditional app interfaces, allowing users to manage their\nmarketplace activities with greater efficiency.

However, current\nmedical FMs typically generate answers in a black-box manner, lacking\ntransparent reasoning processes and locally grounded interpretability, which\nhinders their practical clinical deployments. To this end, we introduce\nDeepMedix-R1, a holistic medical FM for chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation. It\nleverages a sequential training pipeline: initially fine-tuned on curated CXR\ninstruction data to equip with fundamental CXR interpretation capabilities,\nthen exposed to high-quality synthetic reasoning samples to enable cold-start\nreasoning, and finally refined via online reinforcement learning to enhance\nboth grounded reasoning quality and generation performance. Thus, the model\nproduces both an answer and reasoning steps tied to the image's local regions\nfor each query. Quantitative evaluation demonstrates substantial improvements\nin report generation (e.g., 14.54% and 31.32% over LLaVA-Rad and MedGemma) and\nvisual question answering (e.g., 57.75% and 23.06% over MedGemma and CheXagent)\ntasks. To facilitate robust assessment, we propose Report Arena, a benchmarking\nframework using advanced language models to evaluate answer quality, further\nhighlighting the superiority of DeepMedix-R1. Expert review of generated\nreasoning steps reveals greater interpretability and clinical plausibility\ncompared to the established Qwen2.5-VL-7B model (0.7416 vs. 0.2584 overall\npreference).

To\naddress this, we present a world model implanting framework (WorMI) that\ncombines the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with\nindependently learned, domain-specific world models through test-time\ncomposition. By allowing seamless implantation and removal of the world models,\nthe embodied agent's policy achieves and maintains cross-domain adaptability.\nIn the WorMI framework, we employ a prototype-based world model retrieval\napproach, utilizing efficient trajectory-based abstract representation\nmatching, to incorporate relevant models into test-time composition. We also\ndevelop a world-wise compound attention method that not only integrates the\nknowledge from the retrieved world models but also aligns their intermediate\nrepresentations with the reasoning model's representation within the agent's\npolicy.

External memory is a natural way to persist these discoveries, and\nrecent work has shown clear benefits for reasoning-intensive tasks. We see an\nopportunity to make such memories more broadly reusable and scalable by moving\nbeyond instance-based memory entries (e.g. exact query/response pairs, or\nsummaries tightly coupled with the original problem context) toward\nconcept-level memory: reusable, modular abstractions distilled from solution\ntraces and stored in natural language. For future queries, relevant concepts\nare selectively retrieved and integrated into the prompt, enabling test-time\ncontinual learning without weight updates. Our design introduces new strategies\nfor abstracting takeaways from rollouts and retrieving entries for new queries,\npromoting reuse and allowing memory to expand with additional experiences. On\nthe challenging ARC-AGI benchmark, our method yields a 7.5% relative gain over\na strong no-memory baseline with performance continuing to scale with inference\ncompute. We find abstract concepts to be the most consistent memory design,\noutscoring the baseline at all tested inference compute scales. Moreover, we\nconfirm that dynamically updating memory during test-time outperforms an\notherwise identical fixed memory setting with additional attempts, supporting\nthe hypothesis that solving more problems and abstracting more patterns to\nmemory enables further solutions in a form of self-improvement.

Existing reflective strategies (e.g., Reflexion,\nReAct) improve per-episode behavior but typically produce ephemeral,\ntask-specific traces that are not reused across tasks. Reinforcement-learning\nbased alternatives can produce transferable policies but require substantial\nparameter updates and compute. In this work we introduce Meta-Policy Reflexion\n(MPR): a hybrid framework that consolidates LLM-generated reflections into a\nstructured, predicate-like Meta-Policy Memory (MPM) and applies that memory at\ninference time through two complementary mechanisms soft memory-guided decoding\nand hard rule admissibility checks(HAC). MPR (i) externalizes reusable\ncorrective knowledge without model weight updates, (ii) enforces domain\nconstraints to reduce unsafe or invalid actions, and (iii) retains the\nadaptability of language-based reflection. We formalize the MPM representation,\npresent algorithms for update and decoding, and validate the approach in a\ntext-based agent environment following the experimental protocol described in\nthe provided implementation (AlfWorld-based). Empirical results reported in the\nsupplied material indicate consistent gains in execution accuracy and\nrobustness when compared to Reflexion baselines; rule admissibility further\nimproves stability. We analyze mechanisms that explain these gains, discuss\nscalability and failure modes, and outline future directions for multimodal and\nmulti?agent extensions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 Meta-Policy Reflexion(MPR)\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \uc2e4\ud328, \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ubc0f \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uad50\ucc28 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc801\uc751\ub825\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "MPR\uc740 LLM\uc774 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c \ubc18\uc0ac(reflections)\ub97c \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uba54\ud0c0 \uc815\ucc45 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac(MPM)\ub85c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uace0, \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc720\ub3c4 \ub514\ucf54\ub529 \ubc0f \ud558\ub4dc \uaddc\uce59 \ud5c8\uc6a9\uc131 \uccb4\ud06c(HAC)\ub77c\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubcf4\uc644\uc801 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc \uc774 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\ub97c \uc801\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, MPR\uc740 Reflexion \uae30\uc900\uc120\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\ud589 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc640 \uac15\uc778\uc131\uc744 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf30\uc73c\uba70, \uaddc\uce59 \ud5c8\uc6a9\uc131 \uccb4\ud06c\uac00 \ucd94\uac00\uc801\uc778 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 MPR\uc774 \uc62c\ubc14\ub978 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc678\ubd80\ud654\ud558\uace0 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \uc9d1\ud589\ud558\uba70 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc18\uc0ac\uc758 \uc801\uc751\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc778\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc791\uc5c5 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \uc2e4\ud328, \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ubc0f \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uad50\ucc28 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc801\uc751\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubc18\uc0ac \uc804\ub7b5(\uc608: Reflexion, ReAct)\uc740 \uc5d0\ud53c\uc18c\ub4dc\ubcc4 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\uc5c5 \uac04 \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \uc77c\uc2dc\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud2b9\uc815\uc801\uc778 \ud754\uc801\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4. \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc18 \ub300\uc548\uc740 \uc804\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\uc640 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 LLM\uc774 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c \ubc18\uc0ac\ub97c \uad6c\uc870\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc220\uc5b4\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uba54\ud0c0 \uc815\ucc45 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac(MPM)\ub85c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uace0, \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc0c1\ud638 \ubcf4\uc644\uc801 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc778 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc720\ub3c4 \ub514\ucf54\ub529\uacfc \ud558\ub4dc \uaddc\uce59 \ud5c8\uc6a9\uc131 \uccb4\ud06c(HAC)\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\ub97c \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 \uba54\ud0c0 \uc815\ucc45 \ubc18\uc0ac(MPR)\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.

However, a significant\ntheoretical gap persists, as traditional token-level RL frameworks fail to\nalign with the reasoning-level nature of complex, multi-step thought processes\nlike Chain-of-Thought (CoT). To address this challenge, we introduce CoT-Space,\na novel theoretical framework that recasts LLM reasoning from a discrete\ntoken-prediction task to an optimization process within a continuous,\nreasoning-level semantic space. By analyzing this process from both a noise\nperspective and a risk perspective, we demonstrate that the convergence to an\noptimal CoT length is a natural consequence of the fundamental trade-off\nbetween underfitting and overfitting. Furthermore, extensive experiments\nprovide strong empirical validation for our theoretical findings. Our framework\nnot only provides a coherent explanation for empirical phenomena such as\noverthinking but also offers a solid theoretical foundation to guide the future\ndevelopment of more effective and generalizable reasoning agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 CoT-Space\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uc5ec, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud1a0\ud070 \uc218\uc900 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc774 \uac00\uc9c4 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "CoT-Space\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec LLM\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uc5f0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uc758\ubbf8 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uacfc\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uae30\uc874 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ubc1c\uacac\uc758 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uacfc\ub3c4\ud55c \uc0ac\uace0\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud558\uace0, \ub354 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ud1a0\ub300\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc740 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc790\ub9ac \uc7a1\uc558\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ud1a0\ud070 \uc218\uc900 RL \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc5f0\uc1c4\uc0ac\uace0(Chain-of-Thought, CoT)\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc0ac\uace0 \uacfc\uc815\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \uc218\uc900 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uacfc \uc77c\uce58\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \ud070 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uaca9\ucc28\uac00 \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 CoT-Space\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uace0, LLM\uc758 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc774\uc0b0\uc801\uc778 \ud1a0\ud070 \uc608\uce21 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5f0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ucd94\ub860 \uc218\uc900 \uc758\ubbf8 \uacf5\uac04 \ub0b4\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uacfc\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ub178\uc774\uc988 \uad00\uc810\uacfc \uc704\ud5d8 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd84\uc11d\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ucd5c\uc801 CoT \uae38\uc774\ub85c\uc758 \uc218\ub834\uc774 \uacfc\uc18c\uc801\ud569\uacfc \uacfc\uc801\ud569 \uac04\uc758 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uac70\ub798\uc758 \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7ec\uc6b4 \uacb0\uacfc\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \uac8c\ub2e4\uac00, \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc774 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ubc1c\uacac\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uacfc\ub3c4\ud55c \uc0ac\uace0\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \ud604\uc0c1\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud560 \ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c, \ub354 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ubbf8\ub798 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \uc548\ub0b4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud655\uace0\ud55c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

The approach effectively\nreduces the size of the solver's search space, significantly speeding up route\noptimization.

We designed\nan experiment where we let the DQN and CFR agent play against each other while\nwe log their actions.

Although both attempt to perform bluffs at\ndifferent rates, the percentage of successful bluffs (where the opponent folds)\nis roughly the same.

If artificial general\nintelligence (AGI) is achieved, AI systems may be able to understand, reason,\nproblem solve, create, and evolve at a level and speed that humans will\nincreasingly be unable to match, or even understand. These possibilities raise\na natural question as to whether AI will eventually become superior to humans,\na successor \"digital species\", with a rightful claim to assume leadership of\nthe universe. However, a deeper consideration suggests the overlooked\ndifferentiator between human beings and AI is not the brain, but the central\nnervous system (CNS), providing us with an immersive integration with physical\nreality. It is our CNS that enables us to experience emotion including pain,\njoy, suffering, and love, and therefore to fully appreciate the consequences of\nour actions on the world around us. And that emotional understanding of the\nconsequences of our actions is what is required to be able to develop\nsustainable ethical systems, and so be fully qualified to be the leaders of the\nuniverse. A CNS cannot be manufactured or simulated; it must be grown as a\nbiological construct. And so, even the development of consciousness will not be\nsufficient to make AI systems superior to humans. AI systems may become more\ncapable than humans on almost every measure and transform our society.

However,\nexisting LLM agents largely overlook the functional role of emotions in such\nnegotiations, instead generating passive, preference-driven emotional responses\nthat make them vulnerable to manipulation and strategic exploitation by\nadversarial counterparts. To address this gap, we present EvoEmo, an\nevolutionary reinforcement learning framework that optimizes dynamic emotional\nexpression in negotiations. EvoEmo models emotional state transitions as a\nMarkov Decision Process and employs population-based genetic optimization to\nevolve high-reward emotion policies across diverse negotiation scenarios. We\nfurther propose an evaluation framework with two baselines -- vanilla\nstrategies and fixed-emotion strategies -- for benchmarking emotion-aware\nnegotiation. Extensive experiments and ablation studies show that EvoEmo\nconsistently outperforms both baselines, achieving higher success rates, higher\nefficiency, and increased buyer savings. This findings highlight the importance\nof adaptive emotional expression in enabling more effective LLM agents for\nmulti-turn negotiation.", "AI": {"tldr": "EvoEmo\ub294 \uac10\uc815 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc9c4\ud654\uc801 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud611\uc0c1 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \ub192\uc740 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uac10\uc815 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc9c4\ud654\uc2dc\ucf1c LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud134 \ud611\uc0c1 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud604\uc7ac LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ud611\uc0c1\uc5d0\uc11c \uac10\uc815\uc758 \uae30\ub2a5\uc801 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \uac04\uacfc\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub294 \uc870\uc791\uacfc \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \ucc29\ucde8\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ub9cc\ub4e0\ub2e4.", "method": "EvoEmo\ub294 \uac10\uc815 \uc0c1\ud0dc \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uacb0\uc815 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uace0, \uc778\uad6c \uae30\ubc18 \uc720\uc804\uc790 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud611\uc0c1 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \ub192\uc740 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uac10\uc815 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ubc1c\uc804\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "result": "EvoEmo\ub294 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc778 \uc77c\ubc18 \uc804\ub7b5\uacfc \uace0\uc815 \uac10\uc815 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ub2a5\uac00\ud558\uc5ec \uc131\uacf5\ub960, \ud6a8\uc728\uc131, \uad6c\ub9e4\uc790 \uc808\uac10\uc561\uc5d0\uc11c \ub192\uc740 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc801\uc751\ud615 \uac10\uc815 \ud45c\ud604\uc740 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud134 \ud611\uc0c1\uc5d0\uc11c \ub354 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc758 \uc0ac\uace0 \uacfc\uc815(Chain-of-Thought, CoT) \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud558\uace0 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud134\uc758 \ud611\uc0c1\uc5d0 \ucc38\uc5ec\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90c\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc5f4\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874\uc758 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud611\uc0c1\uc5d0\uc11c \uac10\uc815\uc758 \uae30\ub2a5\uc801 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uac04\uacfc\ud558\uace0, \uc218\ub3d9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc120\ud638 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uac10\uc815 \ubc18\uc751\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uc801\ub300\uc801\uc778 \uc0c1\ub300\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc870\uc791 \ubc0f \uc804\ub7b5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucc29\ucde8\ub2f9\ud558\ub294 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uc18c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud611\uc0c1\uc5d0\uc11c \ub3d9\uc801 \uac10\uc815 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc9c4\ud654\uc801 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 EvoEmo\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.
