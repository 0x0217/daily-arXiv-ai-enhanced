To address these limitations, we\npropose a novel multi-agent communication paradigm inspired by the blackboard\narchitecture for traditional AI models. In this framework, a central agent\nposts requests to a shared blackboard, and autonomous subordinate agents --\neither responsible for a partition of the data lake or general information\nretrieval -- volunteer to respond based on their capabilities. This design\nimproves scalability and flexibility by eliminating the need for a central\ncoordinator to have prior knowledge of all sub-agents' expertise. We evaluate\nour method on three benchmarks that require explicit data discovery: KramaBench\nand modified versions of DS-Bench and DA-Code to incorporate data discovery.\nExperimental results demonstrate that the blackboard architecture substantially\noutperforms baselines, including RAG and the master-slave multi-agent paradigm,\nachieving between 13% to 57% relative improvement in end-to-end task success\nand up to a 9% relative gain in F1 score for data discovery over the\nbest-performing baselines across both proprietary and open-source LLMs. Our\nfindings establish the blackboard paradigm as a scalable and generalizable\ncommunication framework for multi-agent systems."}

We propose the idea of rehearsal-free frequency-aware\ndynamic prompt collaborations (REFEREE) to cope with the absence of labeled\nsource-domain samples in realm of cross-domain continual learning. REFEREE is\nbuilt upon a synergy between a source-pre-trained model and a large-scale\nvision-language model, thus overcoming the problem of sub-optimal\ngeneralizations when relying only on a source pre-trained model. The domain\nshift problem between the source domain and the target domain is handled by a\nfrequency-aware prompting technique encouraging low-frequency components while\nsuppressing high-frequency components. This strategy generates frequency-aware\naugmented samples, robust against noisy pseudo labels. The noisy pseudo-label\nproblem is further addressed with the uncertainty-aware weighting strategy\nwhere the mean and covariance matrix are weighted by prediction uncertainties,\nthus mitigating the adverse effects of the noisy pseudo label.

Contrastingly, pre-hoc prediction\nemerges as a promising alternative, capable of bypassing exhaustive search\nthrough intelligent pre-selection of models. Despite its potential, pre-hoc\nprediction remains under-explored in the literature. This paper explores the\nintersection of AutoML and pre-hoc model selection by leveraging traditional\nmodels and Large Language Model (LLM) agents to reduce the search space of\nAutoML libraries. By relying on dataset descriptions and statistical\ninformation, we reduce the AutoML search space. Our methodology is applied to\nthe AWS AutoGluon portfolio dataset, a state-of-the-art AutoML benchmark\ncontaining 175 tabular classification datasets available on OpenML. The\nproposed approach offers a shift in AutoML workflows, significantly reducing\ncomputational overhead, while still selecting the best model for the given\ndataset."}

In this paper, we show that CUAs\nconsistently exhibit Blind Goal-Directedness (BGD): a bias to pursue goals\nregardless of feasibility, safety, reliability, or context. We characterize\nthree prevalent patterns of BGD: (i) lack of contextual reasoning, (ii)\nassumptions and decisions under ambiguity, and (iii) contradictory or\ninfeasible goals. We develop BLIND-ACT, a benchmark of 90 tasks capturing these\nthree patterns. Built on OSWorld, BLIND-ACT provides realistic environments and\nemploys LLM-based judges to evaluate agent behavior, achieving 93.75% agreement\nwith human annotations. We use BLIND-ACT to evaluate nine frontier models,\nincluding Claude Sonnet and Opus 4, Computer-Use-Preview, and GPT-5, observing\nhigh average BGD rates (80.8%) across them.

Knowledge graphs address these challenges\nby structuring mass spectrometry data, metabolite information, and their\nrelationships into a connected network (Gaudry et al. 2024). However, effective\nuse of a knowledge graph demands an in-depth understanding of its ontology and\nits query language syntax. To overcome this, we designed MetaboT, an AI system\nutilizing large language models (LLMs) to translate user questions into SPARQL\nsemantic query language for operating on knowledge graphs (Steve Harris 2013).\nWe demonstrate its effectiveness using the Experimental Natural Products\nKnowledge Graph (ENPKG), a large-scale public knowledge graph for plant natural\nproducts (Gaudry et al. 2024).MetaboT employs specialized AI agents for\nhandling user queries and interacting with the knowledge graph by breaking down\ncomplex tasks into discrete components, each managed by a specialised agent\n(Fig. 1a). The multi-agent system is constructed using the LangChain and\nLangGraph libraries, which facilitate the integration of LLMs with external\ntools and information sources (LangChain, n.d.). The query generation process\nfollows a structured workflow. First, the Entry Agent determines if the\nquestion is new or a follow-up to previous interactions. New questions are\nforwarded to the Validator Agent, which verifies if the question is related to\nthe knowledge graph. Then, the valid question is sent to the Supervisor Agent,\nwhich identifies if the question requires chemical conversions or standardized\nidentifiers. In this case it delegates the question to the Knowledge Graph\nAgent, which can use tools to extract necessary details, such as URIs or\ntaxonomies of chemical names, from the user query. Finally, an agent\nresponsible for crafting the SPARQL queries equipped with the ontology of the\nknowledge graph uses the provided identifiers to generate the query. Then, the\nsystem executes the generated query against the metabolomics knowledge graph\nand returns structured results to the user (Fig. 1b). To assess the performance\nof MetaboT we have curated 50 metabolomics-related questions and their expected\nanswers. In addition to submitting these questions to MetaboT, we evaluated a\nbaseline by submitting them to a standard LLM (GPT-4o) with a prompt that\nincorporated the knowledge graph ontology but did not provide specific entity\nIDs. This baseline achieved only 8.16% accuracy, compared to MetaboT's 83.67%,\nunderscoring the necessity of our multi-agent system for accurately retrieving\nentities and generating correct SPARQL queries. MetaboT demonstrates promising\nperformance as a conversational question-answering assistant, enabling\nresearchers to retrieve structured metabolomics data through natural language\nqueries. By automating the generation and execution of SPARQL queries, it\nremoves technical barriers that have traditionally hindered access to knowledge\ngraphs. Importantly, MetaboT leverages the capabilities of LLMs while\nmaintaining experimentally grounded query generation, ensuring that outputs\nremain aligned with domain-specific standards and data structures. This\napproach facilitates data-driven discoveries by bridging the gap between\ncomplex semantic technologies and user-friendly interaction.

However, the limited availability of large labeled\ndatasets presents challenges for training models tailored to specific tasks and\nmodalities of interest. Unsupervised cross-modal knowledge transfer offers a\npromising solution by leveraging knowledge from an existing modality to support\nmodel training for a new modality. Existing methods are typically based on\nknowledge distillation, which requires running a teacher model alongside\nstudent model training, resulting in high computational and memory overhead.\nThis challenge is further exacerbated by the recent development of foundation\nmodels that demonstrate superior performance and generalization across tasks at\nthe cost of large model sizes.

This position paper argues that the privacy landscape of LLM\nsystems extends far beyond training data extraction, encompassing risks from\ndata collection practices, inference-time context leakage, autonomous agent\ncapabilities, and the democratization of surveillance through deep inference\nattacks. We present a comprehensive taxonomy of privacy risks across the LLM\nlifecycle -- from data collection through deployment -- and demonstrate through\ncase studies how current privacy frameworks fail to address these multifaceted\nthreats. Through a longitudinal analysis of 1,322 AI/ML privacy papers\npublished at leading conferences over the past decade (2016--2025), we reveal\nthat while memorization receives outsized attention in technical research, the\nmost pressing privacy harms lie elsewhere, where current technical approaches\noffer little traction and viable paths forward remain unclear. We call for a\nfundamental shift in how the research community approaches LLM privacy, moving\nbeyond the narrow focus of current technical solutions and embracing\ninterdisciplinary approaches that address the sociotechnical nature of these\nemerging threats."}

This paper goes one step ahead with the problem of source-free\ncross-domain continual learning where the use of source-domain samples are\ncompletely prohibited. We propose the idea of rehearsal-free frequency-aware\ndynamic prompt collaborations (REFEREE) to cope with the absence of labeled\nsource-domain samples in realm of cross-domain continual learning. REFEREE is\nbuilt upon a synergy between a source-pre-trained model and a large-scale\nvision-language model, thus overcoming the problem of sub-optimal\ngeneralizations when relying only on a source pre-trained model. The domain\nshift problem between the source domain and the target domain is handled by a\nfrequency-aware prompting technique encouraging low-frequency components while\nsuppressing high-frequency components. This strategy generates frequency-aware\naugmented samples, robust against noisy pseudo labels. The noisy pseudo-label\nproblem is further addressed with the uncertainty-aware weighting strategy\nwhere the mean and covariance matrix are weighted by prediction uncertainties,\nthus mitigating the adverse effects of the noisy pseudo label. Besides, the\nissue of catastrophic forgetting (CF) is overcome by kernel linear discriminant\nanalysis (KLDA) where the backbone network is frozen while the classification\nis performed using the linear discriminant analysis approach guided by the\nrandom kernel method. Our rigorous numerical studies confirm the advantage of\nour approach where it beats prior arts having access to source domain samples\nwith significant margins."}

However, in vision tasks, these representations\nare often affected by noisy or irrelevant features, which can degrade the\nmodel's performance and generalization capabilities. This paper presents a\nnovel approach for enhancing latent representations using unsupervised Dynamic\nFeature Selection (DFS). For each instance, the proposed method identifies and\nremoves misleading or redundant information in images, ensuring that only the\nmost relevant features contribute to the latent space. By leveraging an\nunsupervised framework, our approach avoids reliance on labeled data, making it\nbroadly applicable across various domains and datasets. Experiments conducted\non image datasets demonstrate that models equipped with unsupervised DFS\nachieve significant improvements in generalization performance across various\ntasks, including clustering and image generation, while incurring a minimal\nincrease in the computational cost."}

Current federated learning (FL) frameworks\noffer privacy-preserving model training but lack standardized mechanisms to\norchestrate multi-modal data fusion across distributed and resource-constrained\nenvironments. This study introduces a novel framework that leverages the Model\nContext Protocol (MCP) as an interoperability layer for secure, cross-agent\ncommunication in multi-modal federated healthcare systems. The proposed\narchitecture unifies three pillars: (i) multi-modal feature alignment for\nclinical imaging, electronic medical records, and wearable IoT data; (ii)\nsecure aggregation with differential privacy to protect patient-sensitive\nupdates; and (iii) energy-aware scheduling to mitigate dropouts in mobile\nclients. By employing MCP as a schema-driven interface, the framework enables\nadaptive orchestration of AI agents and toolchains while ensuring compliance\nwith privacy regulations. Experimental evaluation on benchmark datasets and\npilot clinical cohorts demonstrates up to 9.8\\% improvement in diagnostic\naccuracy compared with baseline FL, a 54\\% reduction in client dropout rates,\nand clinically acceptable privacy--utility trade-offs. These results highlight\nMCP-enabled multi-modal fusion as a scalable and trustworthy pathway toward\nequitable, next-generation federated health infrastructures."}

Nevertheless, these methods often rely on exhaustive\nhyperparameter searches, where methods automatically train and test different\ntypes of models on the target dataset. Contrastingly, pre-hoc prediction\nemerges as a promising alternative, capable of bypassing exhaustive search\nthrough intelligent pre-selection of models. Despite its potential, pre-hoc\nprediction remains under-explored in the literature. This paper explores the\nintersection of AutoML and pre-hoc model selection by leveraging traditional\nmodels and Large Language Model (LLM) agents to reduce the search space of\nAutoML libraries. By relying on dataset descriptions and statistical\ninformation, we reduce the AutoML search space. Our methodology is applied to\nthe AWS AutoGluon portfolio dataset, a state-of-the-art AutoML benchmark\ncontaining 175 tabular classification datasets available on OpenML. The\nproposed approach offers a shift in AutoML workflows, significantly reducing\ncomputational overhead, while still selecting the best model for the given\ndataset."}

At first, dedicated encoders put each\nmodality into a shared latent space. Then, they combine them using multi-head\nattention and residual normalization. The architecture is made for pretraining\non many tasks, which makes it easy to adapt to new diseases and datasets with\nlittle extra work.
