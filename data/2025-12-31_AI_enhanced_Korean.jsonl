This poses considerable challenges for effective organizational governance, particularly in comprehensively identifying, assessing, and mitigating diverse and evolving risks. To tackle this, we introduce the Agentic Risk \\& Capability (ARC) Framework, a technical governance framework designed to help organizations identify, assess, and mitigate risks arising from agentic AI systems. The framework's core contributions are: (1) it develops a novel capability-centric perspective to analyze a wide range of agentic AI systems; (2) it distills three primary sources of risk intrinsic to agentic AI systems - components, design, and capabilities; (3) it establishes a clear nexus between each risk source, specific materialized risks, and corresponding technical controls; and (4) it provides a structured and practical approach to help organizations implement the framework. This framework provides a robust and adaptable methodology for organizations to navigate the complexities of agentic AI, enabling rapid and effective innovation while ensuring the safe, secure, and responsible deployment of agentic AI systems.

Current approaches rely primarily on static validation methods that fail to catch behavior-level errors arising from interactive execution. In this paper, we propose Agent2World, a tool-augmented multi-agent framework that achieves strong inference-time world-model generation and also serves as a data engine for supervised fine-tuning, by grounding generation in multi-agent feedback. Agent2World follows a three-stage pipeline: (i) A Deep Researcher agent performs knowledge synthesis by web searching to address specification gaps; (ii) A Model Developer agent implements executable world models; And (iii) a specialized Testing Team conducts adaptive unit testing and simulation-based validation. Agent2World demonstrates superior inference-time performance across three benchmarks spanning both Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) and executable code representations, achieving consistent state-of-the-art results. Beyond inference, Testing Team serves as an interactive environment for the Model Developer, providing behavior-aware adaptive feedback that yields multi-turn training trajectories. The model fine-tuned on these trajectories substantially improves world-model generation, yielding an average relative gain of 30.95% over the same model before training.

Zimmermann", "Geoffrey Irving", "Sebastian Farquhar", "Alan Cooney"], "title": "Practical challenges of control monitoring in frontier AI deployments", "comment": null, "summary": "Automated control monitors could play an important role in overseeing highly capable AI agents that we do not fully trust. Prior work has explored control monitoring in simplified settings, but scaling monitoring to real-world deployments introduces additional dynamics: parallel agent instances, non-negligible oversight latency, incremental attacks between agent instances, and the difficulty of identifying scheming agents based on individual harmful actions. In this paper, we analyse design choices to address these challenges, focusing on three forms of monitoring with different latency-safety trade-offs: synchronous, semi-synchronous, and asynchronous monitoring. We introduce a high-level safety case sketch as a tool for understanding and comparing these monitoring protocols. Our analysis identifies three challenges -- oversight, latency, and recovery -- and explores them in four case studies of possible future AI deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc790\ub3d9 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub294 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \uace0\uc131\ub2a5 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uac10\ub3c5\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc9c0\uc5f0-\uc548\uc804\uc131 \ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ub4dc\uc624\ud504\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\uc758 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud615\ud0dc\uc778 \ub3d9\uae30\uc2dd, \ubc18\ub3d9\uae30\uc2dd, \ube44\ub3d9\uae30\uc2dd \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \uace0\uc131\ub2a5 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uac10\ub3c5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131.", "method": "\ub3d9\uae30\uc2dd, \ubc18\ub3d9\uae30\uc2dd, \ube44\ub3d9\uae30\uc2dd \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1 \ub4f1 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1 \ud615\ud0dc\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \uc124\uacc4 \uc120\ud0dd\uc744 \uc870\ub9dd.", "result": "\uc124\uacc4 \uc120\ud0dd \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uac10\ub3c5, \uc9c0\uc5f0, \ubcf5\uad6c\ub77c\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub3c4\uc804\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0, \ud5a5\ud6c4 AI \ubc30\uce58\uc758 \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc0ac\ub840\ub97c \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "AI\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \ubc30\uce58\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0 \ube44\uad50\ud558\ub294 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub85c\uc11c \uc548\uc804 \uc0ac\ub840 \uc2a4\ucf00\uce58\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0, \uac01 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1 \ud615\ud0dc\uc758 \uc7a5\ub2e8\uc810\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uc81c\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub294 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uac00 \uc644\uc804\ud788 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \uace0\uc131\ub2a5 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uac10\ub3c5\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uc804 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud654\ub41c \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud588\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc2e4\uc81c \uc138\uacc4 \ubc30\uce58\ub85c\uc758 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1\uc740 \ucd94\uac00\uc801\uc778 \uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: \ubcd1\ub82c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4, \ubb34\uc2dc\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \uac10\ub3c5 \uc9c0\uc5f0, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4 \uac04\uc758 \uc810\uc9c4\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9, \uac1c\ubcc4 \ud574\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uc74c\ubaa8\ub97c \uafb8\ubbf8\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0 \ub4f1\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc124\uacc4 \uc120\ud0dd\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uba70, \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \uc9c0\uc5f0-\uc548\uc804\uc131 \ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ub4dc\uc624\ud504\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud615\ud0dc\uc758 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\uc5d0 \uc8fc\ubaa9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: \ub3d9\uae30\uc2dd, \ubc18\ub3d9\uae30\uc2dd, \ube44\ub3d9\uae30\uc2dd \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0 \ube44\uad50\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c\ub85c\uc11c \uace0\uc218\uc900 \uc548\uc804 \uc0ac\ub840 \uc2a4\ucf00\uce58\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubd84\uc11d\uc740 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c - \uac10\ub3c5, \uc9c0\uc5f0, \ubcf5\uad6c - \ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0, \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubbf8\ub798 AI \ubc30\uce58\uc758 \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc0ac\ub840 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\ub4e4\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, current agent architectures are frequently constructed using imperative, ad hoc patterns. This results in brittle systems plagued by difficulties in state management, error handling, and concurrency. This paper introduces Monadic Context Engineering (MCE), a novel architectural paradigm leveraging the algebraic structures of Functors, Applicative Functors, and Monads to provide a formal foundation for agent design. MCE treats agent workflows as computational contexts where cross-cutting concerns, such as state propagation, short-circuiting error handling, and asynchronous execution, are managed intrinsically by the algebraic properties of the abstraction. We demonstrate how Monads enable robust sequential composition, how Applicatives provide a principled structure for parallel execution, and crucially, how Monad Transformers allow for the systematic composition of these capabilities. This layered approach enables developers to construct complex, resilient, and efficient AI agents from simple, independently verifiable components. We further extend this framework to describe Meta-Agents, which leverage MCE for generative orchestration, dynamically creating and managing sub-agent workflows through metaprogramming.

Existing image protection systems mainly rely on digital watermarking, which is susceptible to sophisticated digital attacks. To address this limitation, we propose a hybrid optical-digital framework that incorporates physical authentication cues during image formation and preserves them through a learned reconstruction process. At the optical level, a phase mask in the camera aperture produces a Null-space Optical Watermark (NOWA) that lies in the Null Space of the imaging operator and therefore remains invisible in the captured image. Then, a Null-Space Network (NSN) performs measurement-consistent reconstruction that delivers high-quality protected images while preserving the NOWA signature. The proposed design enables tamper localization by projecting the image onto the camera's null space and detecting pixel-level inconsistencies. Our design preserves perceptual quality, resists common degradations such as compression, and establishes a structural security asymmetry: without access to the optical or NSN parameters, adversaries cannot forge the NOWA signature. Experiments with simulations and a prototype camera demonstrate competitive performance in terms of image quality preservation, and tamper localization accuracy compared to state-of-the-art digital watermarking and learning-based authentication methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uc758 \uc9c4\uc704\uc640 \uc18c\uc720\uad8c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uad11\ud559-\ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uc758 \uc9c4\uc704\uc640 \uc18c\uc720\uad8c \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc740 \ud604\ub300 \ud3b8\uc9d1 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc810\uc810 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6cc\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uae30\uc874 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc815\uad50\ud55c \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\uad11\ud559 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uce74\uba54\ub77c \uc870\ub9ac\uac1c\uc5d0 \uc788\ub294 \uc704\uc0c1 \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud06c\uac00 Null-space Optical Watermark(NOWA)\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uba70, Null-Space Network(NSN)\uac00 \uc774\ub97c \ubcf4\uc874\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub97c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ub514\uc790\uc778\uc740 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uc758 \ubb34\uacb0\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc555\ucd95\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uc800\ud558\uc5d0 \uc800\ud56d\ud558\uace0, \uc704\uc870 \ubc29\uc9c0\uc758 \ubd88\uade0\ud615 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud0b9 \ubc0f \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc18 \uc778\uc99d \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uc758 \uc9c4\uc704\uc640 \uc18c\uc720\uad8c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ud604\ub300 \ud3b8\uc9d1 \ub3c4\uad6c\uac00 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \uc704\uc870\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6cc\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ubcf4\ud638 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc8fc\ub85c \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud0b9\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294\ub370, \uc774\ub294 \uc815\uad50\ud55c \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ud615\uc131 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc778\uc99d \ub2e8\uc11c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uace0 \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\ub97c \ubcf4\uc874\ud558\ub294 \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uad11\ud559-\ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uad11\ud559 \uc218\uc900\uc5d0\uc11c \uce74\uba54\ub77c \uc870\ub9ac\uac1c\uc5d0 \uc788\ub294 \uc704\uc0c1 \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud06c\uac00 Null-space Optical Watermark(NOWA)\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9d5 \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc790\uc758 Null Space\uc5d0 \uc704\uce58\ud558\uc5ec \ucea1\ucc98\ub41c \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\uac8c \ub0a8\ub294\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7f0 \ub2e4\uc74c Null-Space Network(NSN)\ub294 \uce21\uc815 \uc77c\uad00\uc131 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc5ec NOWA \uc11c\uba85\uc744 \ubcf4\uc874\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \ubcf4\ud638 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc124\uacc4\ub294 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uc758 \uce74\uba54\ub77c Null Space\ub85c\uc758 \ud22c\uc0ac\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ubcc0\uc870 \uc704\uce58 \ud655\uc778\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uba70, \ud53d\uc140 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub97c \uac10\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc124\uacc4\ub294 \uc9c0\uac01 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \uc555\ucd95\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uc800\ud558\uc5d0 \uc800\ud56d\ud558\uba70, \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ubcf4\uc548 \ube44\ub300\uce6d\uc744 \ud655\ub9bd\ud55c\ub2e4: \uad11\ud559 \ub610\ub294 NSN \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\uc5d0 \uc811\uadfc\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \ud55c, \uc801\uc740 NOWA \uc11c\uba85\uc744 \uc704\uc870\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub2e4. \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uacfc \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ud0c0\uc785 \uce74\uba54\ub77c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc740 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ud488\uc9c8 \ubcf4\uc874 \ubc0f \ubcc0\uc870 \uc704\uce58 \ud655\uc778 \uc815\ud655\uc131 \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud0b9 \ubc0f \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc18 \uc778\uc99d \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud588\uc744 \ub54c \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4."}}

Conventional approaches often rely on fixed probabilistic models or classifiers, which can be brittle under partial observability and limited interaction. Large language models (LLMs) offer a flexible alternative: by mapping short behavioral traces into high-level hypotheses, they can serve as world models over teammate behavior. We introduce \\Collab, a language-based framework that classifies partner types using a behavior rubric derived from trajectory features, and extend it to \\ReCollab, which incorporates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to stabilize inference with exemplar trajectories. In the cooperative Overcooked environment, \\Collab effectively distinguishes teammate types, while \\ReCollab consistently improves adaptation across layouts, achieving Pareto-optimal trade-offs between classification accuracy and episodic return. These findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs as behavioral world models for AHT and highlight the importance of retrieval grounding in challenging coordination settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ud300\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud30c\ud2b8\ub108 \uc720\ud615\uc744 \ubd84\ub958\ud558\uace0 \uc801\uc751\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ucc98 \ud300\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\uc804\uc5d0 \ubcf4\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c \ub3d9\ub8cc\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ucd94\ub860\ud558\uace0 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc801\uc751\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud589\ub3d9 \ud2b9\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \ud30c\uc0dd\ub41c \ud589\ub3d9 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud30c\ud2b8\ub108 \uc720\ud615\uc744 \ubd84\ub958\ud558\ub294 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \uae30\ubc18 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 \u000b\textit{Collab}\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uace0, \ucd08\uc0c1 \uacbd\ub85c\uc640 \ud568\uaed8 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc548\uc815\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uac80\uc0c9 \ubcf4\uac15 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \u000b\textit{ReCollab}\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud611\ub825\uc801\uc778 Overcooked \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \u000b\textit{Collab}\ub294 \ud300\uc6d0 \uc720\ud615\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\ubcc4\ud558\uace0, \u000b\textit{ReCollab}\ub294 \ub808\uc774\uc544\uc6c3 \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc801\uc751\uc744 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uc5ec \ubd84\ub958 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc640 \uc5d0\ud53c\uc18c\ub4dc \uc218\uc775 \uac04\uc758 \ud30c\ub808\ud1a0 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 AHT\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9 \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c\uc11c LLM\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uace0, \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc778 \uc870\uc815 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uac80\uc0c9 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "Ad-hoc \ud300\uc6cc\ud06c(AHT)\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc774\uc804\uc5d0 \ubcf4\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c \ud300\uc6d0\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ucd94\ub860\ud558\uace0 \uadf8\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc801\uc751\ud574\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uace0\uc815\ub41c \ud655\ub960 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774\ub098 \ubd84\ub958\uae30\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294\ub370, \uc774\ub294 \ubd80\ubd84\uc801\uc778 \uac00\uc2dc\uc131 \ubc0f \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd88\uc548\uc815\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \uc9e7\uc740 \ud589\ub3d9 \ud754\uc801\uc744 \uace0\uc218\uc900 \uac00\uc124\ub85c \ub9e4\ud551\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ud300\uc6d0 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc720\uc5f0\ud55c \ub300\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud589\ub3d9 \ud2b9\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\ub3c4\ub41c \ud589\ub3d9 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud30c\ud2b8\ub108 \uc720\ud615\uc744 \ubd84\ub958\ud558\ub294 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \uae30\ubc18 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 \u000b\textit{Collab}\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uace0, \uc608\uc81c \uacbd\ub85c\uc640 \ud568\uaed8 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc548\uc815\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uac80\uc0c9 \ubcf4\uac15 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \u000b\textit{ReCollab}\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud611\ub825\uc801\uc778 Overcooked \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \u000b\textit{Collab}\ub294 \ud300\uc6d0 \uc720\ud615\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\ubcc4\ud558\uba70, \u000b\textit{ReCollab}\ub294 \ub808\uc774\uc544\uc6c3 \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc801\uc751\uc744 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uc5ec \ubd84\ub958 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc640 \uc5d0\ud53c\uc18c\ub4dc \uc218\uc775 \uac04\uc758 \ud30c\ub808\ud1a0 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 AHT\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9 \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c\uc11c LLM\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uace0, \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc778 \uc870\uc815 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uac80\uc0c9 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

This joint modeling, however, also introduces a critical weakness: perturbations or noise in either the structure or the features can be amplified through message passing, making GNNs highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks and spurious connections. In this work, we introduce a pruning framework that leverages adversarial robustness evaluation to explicitly identify and remove fragile or detrimental components of the graph. By using robustness scores as guidance, our method selectively prunes edges that are most likely to degrade model reliability, thereby yielding cleaner and more resilient graph representations. We instantiate this framework on three representative GNN architectures and conduct extensive experiments on benchmarks.

This stems from a fundamental computational bottleneck: ab initio methods offer quantum accuracy but are restricted to small spatiotemporal scales (< 500 atoms, picoseconds), while empirical force fields lack the reactive fidelity required for complex combustion environments. Herein, we bridge this gap by employing a \"human-in-the-loop\" closed-loop framework where self-auditing AI Agents validate the evolution of a machine learning potential (MLP). By acting as scientific sentinels that visualize hidden model artifacts for human decision-making, this collaborative cycle ensures quantum mechanical accuracy while exhibiting near-linear scalability to million-atom systems and accessing nanosecond timescales (energy RMSE: 1.2 meV/atom, force RMSE: 0.126 eV/Angstrom). Strikingly, our simulations reveal a temperature-regulated dual-mode oxidation mechanism: at moderate temperatures, the oxide shell acts as a dynamic \"gatekeeper,\" regulating oxidation through a \"breathing mode\" of transient nanochannels; above a critical threshold, a \"rupture mode\" unleashes catastrophic shell failure and explosive combustion. Importantly, we resolve a decades-old controversy by demonstrating that aluminum cation outward diffusion, rather than oxygen transport, dominates mass transfer across all temperature regimes, with diffusion coefficients consistently exceeding those of oxygen by 2-3 orders of magnitude. These discoveries establish a unified atomic-scale framework for energetic nanomaterial design, enabling the precision engineering of ignition sensitivity and energy release rates through intelligent

Code available at https://github.com/soham-padia/blockchain-iot-trust", "summary": "Securing blockchain-enabled IoT networks against sophisticated adversarial attacks remains a critical challenge. This paper presents a trust-based delegated consensus framework integrating Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) with Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) for privacy-preserving policy evaluation, combined with learning-based defense mechanisms. We systematically compare three reinforcement learning approaches -- tabular Q-learning (RL), Deep RL with Dueling Double DQN (DRL), and Multi-Agent RL (MARL) -- against five distinct attack families: Naive Malicious Attack (NMA), Collusive Rumor Attack (CRA), Adaptive Adversarial Attack (AAA), Byzantine Fault Injection (BFI), and Time-Delayed Poisoning (TDP). Experimental results on a 16-node simulated IoT network reveal significant performance variations: MARL achieves superior detection under collusive attacks (F1=0.85 vs. DRL's 0.68 and RL's 0.50), while DRL and MARL both attain perfect detection (F1=1.00) against adaptive attacks where RL fails (F1=0.50). All agents successfully defend against Byzantine attacks (F1=1.00). Most critically, the Time-Delayed Poisoning attack proves catastrophic for all agents, with F1 scores dropping to 0.11-0.16 after sleeper activation, demonstrating the severe threat posed by trust-building adversaries. Our findings indicate that coordinated multi-agent learning provides measurable advantages for defending against sophisticated trust manipulation attacks in blockchain IoT environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ube14\ub85d\uccb4\uc778 \uae30\ubc18 IoT \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \uacf5\uaca9 \ubc29\uc5b4\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc2e0\ub8b0 \uae30\ubc18 \uc704\uc784 \ud569\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c \ubc0f \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ube14\ub85d\uccb4\uc778 \uae30\ubc18 IoT \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc815\uad50\ud55c \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ubcf4\ud638\ud574\uc57c \ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc2e0\ub8b0 \uae30\ubc18 \uc704\uc784 \ud569\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \uc644\uc804 \ub3d9\ud615 \uc554\ud638\ud654(FHE)\uc640 \uc18d\uc131 \uae30\ubc18 \uc811\uadfc \uc81c\uc5b4(ABAC)\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uace0 \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "16\uac1c \ub178\ub4dc\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 IoT \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, MARL\uc774 \uc9d1\ub2e8 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uac10\uc9c0 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uace0, DRL\uacfc MARL\uc740 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc644\ubcbd\ud55c \uac10\uc9c0\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ube44\uc794\ud2f4 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubc29\uc5b4\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \ub3c5\uadf9\ubb3c \uacf5\uaca9\uc740 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0\uac8c \uce58\uba85\uc801\uc774\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ud611\uc870\uc801\uc778 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud559\uc2b5\uc774 \ube14\ub85d\uccb4\uc778 IoT \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e0\ub8b0 \uc870\uc791 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubc29\uc5b4\uc5d0 \uce21\uc815 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc774\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc815\uad50\ud55c \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ube14\ub85d\uccb4\uc778 \uae30\ubc18 IoT \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc8fc\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc644\uc804 \ub3d9\ud615 \uc554\ud638\ud654(FHE)\uc640 \uc18d\uc131 \uae30\ubc18 \uc811\uadfc \uc81c\uc5b4(ABAC)\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \uc2e0\ub8b0 \uae30\ubc18 \uc704\uc784 \ud569\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \uc815\ucc45 \ud3c9\uac00\uc640 \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd -

In contrast to regular multi-agent path-finding, the solver finds and updates the assignment of goals to the agents on its own. In the continuous case for a point agent with motions in the Euclidean plane, the problem can be solved arbitrarily close to optimal. For discrete variants that incur node and edge conflicts, we show that it can be solved in polynomial time, which is unexpected, since traditional vehicle routing on general graphs is NP-hard. We implement a corresponding planner that finds conflict-free optimized routes for the agents. Global assignment strategies greatly reduce the number of conflicts, with the remaining ones resolved by elaborating on the concept of ants-on-the-stick, by solving local assignment problems, by interleaving agent paths, and by kicking agents that have already arrived out of their destinations", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubb34\ubc29\ud5a5 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc784\ubb34\ub97c \uacc4\ud68d\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubb34\ubc29\ud5a5 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc784\ubb34\ub97c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud560\ub2f9\ud558\uace0 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub41c \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \ucc3e\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ubaa9\ud45c \ud560\ub2f9\uc744 \uc2a4\uc2a4\ub85c \ucc3e\uace0 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ud558\uba70, \uc5f0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uacbd\uc6b0\uc640 \uc774\uc0b0\uc801\uc778 \uacbd\uc6b0 \ubaa8\ub450 \ub2e4\ub8f9\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774\uc0b0 \ubcc0\ud615 \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \uc608\uae30\uce58 \uc54a\uac8c \ub2e4\ud56d \uc2dc\uac04 \ub0b4\uc5d0 \ud574\uacb0 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uba70, \ucda9\ub3cc \uc5c6\ub294 \ucd5c\uc801 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \ucc3e\ub294 \ud50c\ub798\ub108\ub97c \uad6c\ud604\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc804\uc5ed \ud560\ub2f9 \uc804\ub7b5\uc740 \ucda9\ub3cc \uc218\ub97c \ud06c\uac8c \uc904\uc774\uba70, \ub0a8\uc740 \ucda9\ub3cc\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uae30\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uaca9\uc790\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ubb34\ubc29\ud5a5 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubb34\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc784\ubb34\ub97c \uacc4\ud68d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uacbd\ub85c \ucc3e\uae30\uc640\ub294 \ub2ec\ub9ac, \ud574\uacb0\uc0ac\ub294 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \uc2a4\uc2a4\ub85c \ud560\ub2f9\ud558\uace0 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc720\ud074\ub9ac\ub4dc \ud3c9\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc810 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc5f0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uacbd\uc6b0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ucd5c\uc801\uc5d0 \uc784\uc758\ub85c \uac00\uae5d\uac8c \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub178\ub4dc\uc640 \uc5e3\uc9c0 \ucda9\ub3cc\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc774\uc0b0 \ubcc0\ud615\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574\uc11c\ub294, \uc77c\ubc18 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ucc28\ub7c9 \uacbd\ub85c \uc124\uc815\uc774 NP-\ud558\ub4dc\ub77c\ub294 \uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \uc608\uae30\uce58 \uc54a\uac8c \ub2e4\ud56d \uc2dc\uac04 \ub0b4\uc5d0 \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucda9\ub3cc \uc5c6\ub294 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub41c \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \ucc3e\ub294 \ud50c\ub798\ub108\ub97c \uad6c\ud604\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc804\uc5ed \ud560\ub2f9 \uc804\ub7b5\uc740 \ucda9\ub3cc \uc218\ub97c \ud06c\uac8c \uc904\uc774\uba70, \ub098\uba38\uc9c0 \ucda9\ub3cc\uc740 \uac1c\ubbf8\uac00 \ub9c9\ub300 \uc704\uc5d0 \uc788\ub294 \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \uad6c\uccb4\ud654\ud558\uace0, \uc9c0\uc5ed \ud560\ub2f9 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uad50\ucc28\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba70, \uc774\ubbf8 \ub3c4\ucc29\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ubaa9\uc801\uc9c0\uc5d0\uc11c \ub0b4\ubcf4\ub0b4\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

I present a reinforcement learning framework that integrates a custom tennis simulation environment with a Dueling Double Deep Q-Network(DDQN) trained using curriculum learning. The environment models complete tennis scoring at the level of points, games, and sets, rally-level tactical decisions across ten discrete action categories, symmetric fatigue dynamics, and a continuous opponent skill parameter. The dueling architecture decomposes action-value estimation into state-value and advantage components, while double Q-learning reduces overestimation bias and improves training stability in this long-horizon stochastic domain. Curriculum learning progressively increases opponent difficulty from 0.40 to 0.50, enabling robust skill acquisition without the training collapse observed under fixed opponents. Across extensive evaluations, the trained agent achieves win rates between 98 and 100 percent against balanced opponents and maintains strong performance against more challenging opponents. Serve efficiency ranges from 63.0 to 67.5 percent, and return efficiency ranges from 52.8 to 57.1 percent. Ablation studies demonstrate that both the dueling architecture and curriculum learning are necessary for stable convergence, while a standard DQN baseline fails to learn effective policies. Despite strong performance, tactical analysis reveals a pronounced defensive bias, with the learned policy prioritizing error avoidance and prolonged rallies over aggressive point construction. These results highlight a limitation of win-rate driven optimization in simplified sports simulations and emphasize the importance of reward design for realistic sports reinforcement learning.", "AI":

It has the potential to facilitate real-time network management and optimization functions, including self-configuration, self-optimization, and self-adaptation across diverse and complex environments. This paper proposes SANet, a novel semantic-aware AgentNet architecture for wireless networks that can infer the semantic goal of the user and automatically assign agents associated with different layers of the network to fulfill the inferred goal. Motivated by the fact that AgentNet is a decentralized framework in which collaborating agents may generally have different and even conflicting objectives, we formulate the decentralized optimization of SANet as a multi-agent multi-objective problem, and focus on finding the Pareto-optimal solution for agents with distinct and potentially conflicting objectives. We propose three novel metrics for evaluating SANet. Furthermore, we develop a model partition and sharing (MoPS) framework in which large models, e.g., deep learning models, of different agents can be partitioned into shared and agent-specific parts that are jointly constructed and deployed according to agents' local computational resources. Two decentralized optimization algorithms are proposed. We derive theoretical bounds and prove that there exists a three-way tradeoff among optimization, generalization, and conflicting errors. We develop an open-source RAN and core network-based hardware prototype that implements agents to interact with three different layers of the network. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieved performance gains of up to 14.61% while requiring only 44.37% of FLOPs required by state-of-the-art algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr":

Large language models now enable autonomous planning, tool orchestration, and strategic adaptation at scale, challenging security architectures built on static rules, perimeter defenses, and human-centered workflows. This chapter argues for a shift from prevention-centric security toward agentic cyber resilience. Rather than seeking perfect protection, resilient systems must anticipate disruption, maintain critical functions under attack, recover efficiently, and learn continuously. We situate this shift within the historical evolution of cybersecurity paradigms, culminating in an AI-augmented paradigm where autonomous agents participate directly in sensing, reasoning, action, and adaptation across cyber and cyber-physical systems. We then develop a system-level framework for designing agentic AI workflows. A general agentic architecture is introduced, and attacker and defender workflows are analyzed as coupled adaptive processes, and game-theoretic formulations are shown to provide a unifying design language for autonomy allocation, information flow, and temporal composition. Case studies in automated penetration testing, remediation, and cyber deception illustrate how equilibrium-based design enables system-level resiliency design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548\uc774 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc7ac\ud615\uc131\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc608\ubc29 \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uc728 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ud68c\ubcf5\ub825\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \uc804\ud658\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc815\uc801 \uaddc\uce59\uacfc \uc778\uac04 \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud750\ub984\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uac00 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 AI \uae30\uc220\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ub3c4\uc804\ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubc0f \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84-\ubb3c\ub9ac \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uac10\uc9c0, \ucd94\ub860, \ud589\ub3d9 \ubc0f \uc801\uc751\uc5d0 \ucc38\uac00\ud558\ub294 AI \uc99d\uac15 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uace0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI \uc791\uc5c5 \ud750\ub984 \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc640 \uacf5\uaca9\uc790 \ubc0f \ubc29\uc5b4\uc790\uc758 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud750\ub984\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc5ec \uc790\uc728\uc131 \ud560\ub2f9, \uc815\ubcf4 \ud750\ub984 \ubc0f \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \uad6c\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569 \uc124\uacc4 \uc5b8\uc5b4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uce68\ud22c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ubc0f \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \uae30\ub9cc \uc0ac\ub840 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uade0\ud615 \uae30\ubc18 \uc124\uacc4\uac00 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ud68c\ubcf5\ub825 \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548\uc740 \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc7ac\ud615\uc131\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc774\uc81c \uc790\uc728 \uacc4\ud68d, \ub3c4\uad6c \uc870\uc815 \ubc0f \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \uc801\uc751\uc744 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8\ub85c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \uc815\uc801 \uaddc\uce59, \uacbd\uacc4 \ubc29\uc5b4 \ubc0f \uc778\uac04 \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud750\ub984\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \ubcf4\uc548 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc5d0 \ub3c4\uc804\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc7a5\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc608\ubc29 \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ud68c\ubcf5\ub825\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \uc804\ud658\uc744 \ub17c\uc758\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc644\ubcbd\ud55c \ubcf4\ud638\ub97c \ucd94\uad6c\ud558\uae30\ubcf4\ub2e4\ub294 \ud68c\ubcf5\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc911\ub2e8\uc744 \uc608\uc0c1\ud558\uace0, \uacf5\uaca9 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba70, \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud68c\ubcf5\ud558\uace0, \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc804\ud658\uc740 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc758 \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801 \uc9c4\ud654 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc704\uce58\uc9c0\uc5b4\uc9c0\uba70, \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubc0f \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84-\ubb3c\ub9ac \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uac10\uc9c0, \ucd94\ub860, \ud589\ub3d9 \ubc0f \uc801\uc751\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uc811 \ucc38\uc5ec\ud558\ub294 AI \uc99d\uac15 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\uc810\uc5d0 \uc774\ub978\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\ud6c4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI \uc791\uc5c5 \ud750\ub984 \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uac00 \ub3c4\uc785\ub418\uace0, \uacf5\uaca9\uc790\uc640 \ubc29\uc5b4\uc790\uc758 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud750\ub984\uc774 \uacb0\ud569\ub41c \uc801\uc751 \uacfc\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ub418\uba70, \uac8c\uc784 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uacf5\uc2dd\uc774 \uc790\uc728\uc131 \ud560\ub2f9, \uc815\ubcf4 \ud750\ub984 \ubc0f \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \uad6c\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569 \uc124\uacc4 \uc5b8\uc5b4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4. \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uce68\ud22c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8, \ubcf5\uad6c \ubc0f \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \uae30\ub9cc\uc758 \uc0ac\ub840 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uade0\ud615 \uae30\ubc18 \uc124\uacc4\uac00 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ud68c\ubcf5\ub825 \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4."}}

We introduce Hierarchical Pedagogical Oversight (HPO), a framework that adapts structured adversarial synthesis to educational assessment. Unlike cooperative multi-agent systems that often drift toward superficial consensus, HPO enforces a dialectical separation of concerns: specialist agents first distill dialogue context, which then grounds a moderated, five-act debate between opposing pedagogical critics. We evaluate this framework on the MRBench dataset of 1,214 middle-school mathematics dialogues.

While this \"extrinsic maximization\" approach has rendered superhuman performance in closed, stationary fields, it produces agents that are fragile in open-ended, real-world environments. Standard agents lack internal autonomy: they struggle to explore without dense feedback, fail to adapt to distribution shifts (non-stationarity), and require extensive manual tuning of static hyperparameters. This paper proposes that the unaddressed factor in robust autonomy is a functional analog to biological emotion, serving as a high-level homeostatic control mechanism. We introduce Emotion-Inspired Learning Signals (EILS), a unified framework that replaces scattered optimization heuristics with a coherent, bio-inspired internal feedback engine. Unlike traditional methods that treat emotions as semantic labels, EILS models them as continuous, homeostatic appraisal signals such as Curiosity, Stress, and Confidence. We formalize these signals as vector-valued internal states derived from interaction history. These states dynamically modulate the agent's optimization landscape in real time: curiosity regulates entropy to prevent mode collapse, stress modulates plasticity to overcome inactivity, and confidence adapts trust regions to stabilize convergence. We hypothesize that this closed-loop homeostatic regulation can enable EILS agents to outperform standard baselines in terms of sample efficiency and non-stationary adaptation.", "AI": {"tldr":

However, existing methods suffer from limited generalization capability: unimodal approaches are constrained by data sparsity and inherent biases, while multi-modal methods struggle to effectively capture mobility dynamics caused by the semantic gap between static multi-modal representation and spatial-temporal dynamics. Therefore, we leverage multi-modal spatial-temporal knowledge to characterize mobility dynamics for the location recommendation task, dubbed as \\textbf{M}ulti-\\textbf{M}odal \\textbf{Mob}ility (\\textbf{M}$^3$\\textbf{ob}). First, we construct a unified spatial-temporal relational graph (STRG) for multi-modal representation, by leveraging the functional semantics and spatial-temporal knowledge captured by the large language models (LLMs)-enhanced spatial-temporal knowledge graph (STKG). Second, we design a gating mechanism to fuse spatial-temporal graph representations of different modalities, and propose an STKG-guided cross-modal alignment to inject spatial-temporal dynamic knowledge into the static image modality. Extensive experiments on six public datasets show that our proposed method not only achieves consistent improvements in normal scenarios but also exhibits significant generalization ability in abnormal scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \uacf5\uac04-\uc2dc\uac04 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc774\ub3d9\uc131 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \ud2b9\uc131\ud654\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc704\uce58 \ucd94\ucc9c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc778\uac04 \uc774\ub3d9\uc131\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc608\uce21\uc774 \uc704\uce58 \ucd94\ucc9c \ubc0f \ub300\ud53c \uc81c\uc548\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc0ac\ud68c\uacbd\uc81c\uc801 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubaa8\ub4dc\uc758 \uacf5\uac04-\uc2dc\uac04 \uad00\uacc4 \uadf8\ub798\ud504(STRG)\ub97c \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uace0, \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uc735\ud569\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uac8c\uc774\ud305 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uba70, STKG \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uad50\ucc28 \ubaa8\ub4dc \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uac00 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc5ec\uc12f \uac1c\uc758 \uacf5\uacf5 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\uc0c1 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \uacf5\uac04-\uc2dc\uac04 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc774 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc774\ub3d9\uc131 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc720\uc6a9\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc778\uac04 \uc774\ub3d9\uc131\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc608\uce21\uc740 \uc704\uce58 \ucd94\ucc9c \ubc0f \ub300\ud53c \uc81c\uc548\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc0ac\ud68c\uacbd\uc81c\uc801 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\ucce4\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4: \ub2e8\uc77c \ubaa8\ub4dc \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud76c\uc18c\uc131\uacfc \ub0b4\uc7ac \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ubc1b\ub294 \ubc18\uba74, \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc815\uc801 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ud45c\ud604\uacfc \uacf5\uac04-\uc2dc\uac04 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559 \uac04\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \uaca9\ucc28\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc774\ub3d9\uc131 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \uacf5\uac04-\uc2dc\uac04 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc704\uce58 \ucd94\ucc9c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc774\ub3d9\uc131 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \ud2b9\uc131\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95(Multi-Modal Mobility, M^3ob)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uba3c\uc800, \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\ub85c \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub41c \uacf5\uac04-\uc2dc\uac04 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uadf8\ub798\ud504(STKG)\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3ec\ucc29\ub41c \uae30\ub2a5\uc801 \uc758\ubbf8\uc640 \uacf5\uac04-\uc2dc\uac04 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569 \uacf5\uac04-\uc2dc\uac04 \uad00\uacc4 \uadf8\ub798\ud504(STRG)\ub97c \uad6c\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub458\uc9f8, \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \ubaa8\ub4dc\uc758 \uacf5\uac04-\uc2dc\uac04 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uc735\ud569\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uac8c\uc774\ud305 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uace0, \uc815\uc801 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ubaa8\ub4dc\uc5d0 \uacf5\uac04-\uc2dc\uac04 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc8fc\uc785\ud558\ub294 STKG \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uad50\ucc28 \ubaa8\ub4dc \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5ec\uc12f \uac1c\uc758 \uacf5\uacf5 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uac00 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc815\uc0c1 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud560 \ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \ube44\uc815\uc0c1 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

In this paper, we show that dark patterns are highly effective in steering agent trajectories, posing a significant risk to agent robustness. To quantify this risk, we introduce DECEPTICON, an environment for testing individual dark patterns in isolation. DECEPTICON includes 700 web navigation tasks with dark patterns -- 600 generated tasks and 100 real-world tasks, designed to measure instruction-following success and dark pattern effectiveness. Across state-of-the-art agents, we find dark patterns successfully steer agent trajectories towards malicious outcomes in over 70% of tested generated and real-world tasks -- compared to a human average of 31%. Moreover, we find that dark pattern effectiveness correlates positively with model size and test-time reasoning, making larger, more capable models more susceptible. Leading countermeasures against adversarial attacks, including in-context prompting and guardrail models, fail to consistently reduce the success rate of dark pattern interventions. Our findings reveal dark patterns as a latent and unmitigated risk to web agents, highlighting the urgent need for robust defenses against manipulative designs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc5b4\ub450\uc6b4 \ud328\ud134\uc774 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uada4\uc801\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \uce21\uc815\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 DECEPTICON \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \ud574\ub2f9 \ud328\ud134\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.

Screening high-risk individuals with annual low-dose CT (LDCT) can support earlier detection and reduce deaths, but widespread implementation may strain the already limited radiology workforce. AI models have shown potential in estimating lung cancer risk from LDCT scans. However, high-risk populations for lung cancer are diverse, and these models' performance across demographic groups remains an open question. In this study, we drew on the considerations on confounding factors and ethically significant biases outlined in the JustEFAB framework to evaluate potential performance disparities and fairness in two deep learning risk estimation models for lung cancer screening: the Sybil lung cancer risk model and the Venkadesh21 nodule risk estimator. We also examined disparities in the PanCan2b logistic regression model recommended in the British Thoracic Society nodule management guideline. Both deep learning models were trained on data from the US-based National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), and assessed on a held-out NLST validation set. We evaluated AUROC, sensitivity, and specificity across demographic subgroups, and explored potential confounding from clinical risk factors. We observed a statistically significant AUROC difference in Sybil's performance between women (0.88, 95% CI: 0.86, 0.90) and men (0.81, 95% CI: 0.78, 0.84, p < .001). At 90% specificity, Venkadesh21 showed lower sensitivity for Black (0.39, 95% CI: 0.23, 0.59) than White participants (0.69, 95% CI: 0.65, 0.73). These differences were not explained by available clinical confounders and thus may be classified as unfair biases according to JustEFAB. Our findings highlight the importance of improving and monitoring model performance across underrepresented subgroups, and further research on algorithmic fairness, in lung cancer screening.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ud3d0\uc554\uc740 \uc804 \uc138\uacc4 \uc131\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uc554 \uad00\ub828 \uc0ac\ub9dd\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc6d0\uc778\uc774\ub2e4. \uc5f0\uac04 \uc800\uc120\ub7c9 CT(LDCT) \uac80\uc0ac\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uace0\uc704\ud5d8\uad70\uc758 \uc870\uae30 \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\ub098, \ubc29\uc0ac\uc120\uacfc \uc778\ub825\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud55c \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf4\ud3b8\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\ud589\uc740 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b8 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.

Existing approaches typically model success prediction from the perspective of a single decision-maker, overlooking the collective dynamics of investor groups that dominate real-world venture capital (VC) decisions. In this paper, we propose SimVC-CAS, a novel collective agent system that simulates VC decision-making as a multi-agent interaction process. By designing role-playing agents and a GNN-based supervised interaction module, we reformulate startup financing prediction as a group decision-making task, capturing both enterprise fundamentals and the behavioral dynamics of potential investor networks. Each agent embodies an investor with unique traits and preferences, enabling heterogeneous evaluation and realistic information exchange through a graph-structured co-investment network. Using real-world data from PitchBook and under strict data leakage controls, we show that SimVC-CAS significantly improves predictive accuracy while providing interpretable, multiperspective reasoning, for example, approximately 25% relative improvement with respect to average precision@10.

Larger models can be more vulnerable to introspection-driven jailbreaks and cross-modal manipulation. Traditional cybersecurity lacks ML-specific threat modeling for foundation, multimodal, and RAG systems. Objective: Characterize ML security risks by identifying dominant TTPs, vulnerabilities, and targeted lifecycle stages. Methods: We extract 93 threats from MITRE ATLAS (26), AI Incident Database (12), and literature (55), and analyze 854 GitHub/Python repositories. A multi-agent RAG system (ChatGPT-4o, temp 0.4) mines 300+ articles to build an ontology-driven threat graph linking TTPs, vulnerabilities, and stages. Results: We identify unreported threats including commercial LLM API model stealing, parameter memorization leakage, and preference-guided text-only jailbreaks. Dominant TTPs include MASTERKEY-style jailbreaking, federated poisoning, diffusion backdoors, and preference optimization leakage, mainly impacting pre-training and inference. Graph analysis reveals dense vulnerability clusters in libraries with poor patch propagation.

A central challenge is the end-to-end training of such systems without restrictive architectural or training assumptions. Such tasks fit the theory and approaches of the collaborative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) field. We introduce Reinforcement Networks, a general framework for MARL that organizes agents as vertices in a directed acyclic graph (DAG). This structure extends hierarchical RL to arbitrary DAGs, enabling flexible credit assignment and scalable coordination while avoiding strict topologies, fully centralized training, and other limitations of current approaches. We formalize training and inference methods for the Reinforcement Networks framework and connect it to the LevelEnv concept to support reproducible construction, training, and evaluation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several collaborative MARL setups by developing several Reinforcement Networks models that achieve improved performance over standard MARL baselines. Beyond empirical gains, Reinforcement Networks unify hierarchical, modular, and graph-structured views of MARL, opening a principled path toward designing and training complex multi-agent systems. We conclude with theoretical and practical directions - richer graph morphologies, compositional curricula, and graph-aware exploration. That positions Reinforcement Networks as a foundation for a new line of research in scalable, structured MARL.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 Directed Acyclic Graph \uad6c\uc870\ub97c

However, traditional methods overlook the role of temporal semantic exploration in HMS. This paper explores the use of temporal vision semantics (TVS) derived from human motion sequences, leveraging the image-to-text capabilities of a large language model (LLM) to enhance subspace clustering performance. The core idea is to extract textual motion information from consecutive frames via LLM and incorporate this learned information into the subspace clustering framework. The primary challenge lies in learning TVS from human motion sequences using LLM and integrating this information into subspace clustering. To address this, we determine whether consecutive frames depict the same motion by querying the LLM and subsequently learn temporal neighboring information based on its response. We then develop a TVS-integrated subspace clustering approach, incorporating subspace embedding with a temporal regularizer that induces each frame to share similar subspace embeddings with its temporal neighbors. Additionally, segmentation is performed based on subspace embedding with a temporal constraint that induces the grouping of each frame with its temporal neighbors. We also introduce a feedback-enabled framework that continuously optimizes subspace embedding based on the segmentation output. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches on four benchmark human motion datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740

Travel planning provides a natural and high-impact testbed for these capabilities, as it requires multi-step reasoning, iterative preference elicitation through interaction, and calls to external tools under evolving constraints. Prior work has studied LLMs on travel-planning tasks, but existing settings are limited in domain coverage and multi-turn interaction. As a result, they cannot support dynamic user-agent interaction and therefore fail to comprehensively assess agent capabilities. In this paper, we introduce TravelBench, a real-world travel-planning benchmark featuring multi-turn interaction and tool use. We collect user requests from real-world scenarios and construct three subsets-multi-turn, single-turn, and unsolvable-to evaluate different aspects of agent performance. For stable and reproducible evaluation, we build a controlled sandbox environment with 10 travel-domain tools, providing deterministic tool outputs for reliable reasoning. We evaluate multiple LLMs on TravelBench and conduct an analysis of their behaviors and performance. TravelBench offers a practical and reproducible benchmark for advancing LLM agents in travel planning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 TravelBench\ub77c\ub294 \uc5ec\ud589 \uacc4\ud68d \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uc5ec LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2e4\uac01\ub3c4\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5ec\ud589 \uacc4\ud68d\uc740 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ucd94\ub860, \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \uc120\ud638 \uc218\uc9d1, \uc678\ubd80 \ub3c4\uad6c \ud638\ucd9c\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\uc5ec LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ud558\uae30\uc5d0 \uc801\ud569\ud55c \ubd84\uc57c\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "TravelBench\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc5ec\ud589 \uacc4\ud68d \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc694\uccad\uc744 \uc218\uc9d1\ud558\uace0, \ub2e4\ud68c\uc804, \ub2e8\uc77c \ud68c\uc804, \ud480 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\uc758 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud558\uc704 \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc5ec\ub7ec LLM\uc744 TravelBench\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0, \uadf8\ub4e4\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uacfc \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "TravelBench\ub294 \uc5ec\ud589 \uacc4\ud68d\uc5d0\uc11c LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ubc1c\uc804\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc7ac\ud604 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uacc4\ud68d \uc218\ub9bd \ubc0f \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc5d0 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5ec\ud589 \uacc4\ud68d\uc740 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ucd94\ub860, \uc0c1\ud638 \uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \uc120\ud638 elicitation \ubc0f \uc9c4\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc81c\uc57d \uc870\uac74 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uc678\ubd80 \ub3c4\uad6c \ud638\ucd9c\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\ubbc0\ub85c \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7fd\uace0 \ub192\uc740 \uc601\ud5a5\ub825\uc758 \uc2dc\ud5d8\ub300\uac00 \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uc804 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc5ec\ud589 \uacc4\ud68d \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c LLM\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud588\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874 \uc124\uc815\uc740 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ubc94\uc704 \ubc0f \ub2e4\ud68c\uc804 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacb0\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \uadf8\ub4e4\uc740 \ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790-\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\uc73c\uba70 \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub2e4\ud68c\uc804 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ubc0f \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uae30\ub2a5\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc5ec\ud589 \uacc4\ud68d \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc778 TravelBench\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc694\uccad\uc744 \uc218\uc9d1\ud558\uace0, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uce21\uba74\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud558\uc704 \uc9d1\ud569-\ub2e4\ud68c\uc804, \ub2e8\uc77c \ud68c\uc804 \ubc0f \ud480 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294-\uc744 \uad6c\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc7ac\ud604 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 10\uac1c\uc758 \uc5ec\ud589 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uac16\ucd98 \ud1b5\uc81c\ub41c \uc0cc\ub4dc\ubc15\uc2a4 \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uacb0\uc815\ub860\uc801 \ub3c4\uad6c \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 TravelBench\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5ec\ub7ec LLM\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0, \uadf8\ub4e4\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9 \ubc0f \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

A revised version will appear in the Proceedings of AAAI 2026", "summary": "Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of fields. However, their trustworthiness remains a significant concern, as they are still susceptible to jailbreak attacks aimed at eliciting inappropriate or harmful responses. However, existing jailbreak attacks mainly operate at the natural language level and rely on a single attack strategy, limiting their effectiveness in comprehensively assessing LLM robustness. In this paper, we propose Equacode, a novel multi-strategy jailbreak approach for large language models via equation-solving and code completion. This approach transforms malicious intent into a mathematical problem and then requires the LLM to solve it using code, leveraging the complexity of cross-domain tasks to divert the model's focus toward task completion rather than safety constraints. Experimental results show that Equacode achieves an average success rate of 91.19% on the GPT series and 98.65% across 3 state-of-the-art LLMs, all with only a single query.

However, the MARL field currently lacks a rigorous definition and deeper understanding of heterogeneity. This paper systematically discusses heterogeneity in MARL from the perspectives of definition, quantification, and utilization. First, based on an agent-level modeling of MARL, we categorize heterogeneity into five types and provide mathematical definitions. Second, we define the concept of heterogeneity distance and propose a practical quantification method. Third, we design a heterogeneity-based multi-agent dynamic parameter sharing algorithm as an example of the application of our methodology. Case studies demonstrate that our method can effectively identify and quantify various types of agent heterogeneity. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm, compared to other parameter sharing baselines, has better interpretability and stronger adaptability. The proposed methodology will help the MARL community gain a more comprehensive and profound understanding of heterogeneity, and further promote the development of practical algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(MARL)\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\uc9c8\uc131\uc744 \uc815\uc758, \uc815\ub7c9\ud654 \ubc0f \ud65c\uc6a9 \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub17c\uc758\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "MARL \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\uc9c8\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \uc815\uc758\uc640 \uae4a\uc740 \uc774\ud574\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc218\uc900 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\uc9c8\uc131\uc744 \ub2e4\uc12f \uac00\uc9c0 \uc720\ud615\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ub958\ud558\uace0, \uc774\uc9c8\uc131 \uac70\ub9ac \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \uc815\uc758\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc \uc774\uc9c8\uc131 \uae30\ubc18 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ub3d9\uc801 \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \uacf5\uc720 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc0ac\ub840 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc720\ud615\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc \uc81c\uc548\ud55c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \ub2e4\ub978 \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \uacf5\uc720 \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uacfc \uac15\ud55c \uc801\uc751\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc740 MARL \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ud2f0\uac00 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uae4a\uc740 \uc774\ud574\ub97c \uc5bb\ub3c4\ub85d \ub3c4\uc640\uc8fc\uace0, \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud560 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774\uc9c8\uc131\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(MARL)\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uc18d\uc131\uc73c\ub85c, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uae30\ub2a5\uc801 \ucc28\uc774\ubfd0 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uc815\ucc45 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uacfc \ud658\uacbd \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uacfc\ub3c4 \ubc00\uc811\ud558\uac8c \uad00\ub828\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ud604\uc7ac MARL \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \uc815\uc758\uc640 \uae4a\uc740 \uc774\ud574\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 MARL\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\uc758, \uc815\ub7c9\ud654 \ubc0f \ud65c\uc6a9 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\uc9c8\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub17c\uc758\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uccab\uc9f8, MARL\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc218\uc900 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\uc9c8\uc131\uc744 \ub2e4\uc12f \uac00\uc9c0 \uc720\ud615\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ub958\ud558\uace0 \uc218\ud559\uc801 \uc815\uc758\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub458\uc9f8, \uc774\uc9c8\uc131 \uac70\ub9ac \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \uc815\uc758\ud558\uace0 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc14b\uc9f8, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860 \uc801\uc6a9\uc758 \uc608\ub85c \uc774\uc9c8\uc131 \uae30\ubc18 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ub3d9\uc801 \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \uacf5\uc720 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc0ac\ub840 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc720\ud615\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \ub2e4\ub978 \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \uacf5\uc720 \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uacfc \uac15\ud55c \uc801\uc751\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc740 MARL \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ud2f0\uac00 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc2ec\ub3c4 \uc788\ub294 \uc774\ud574\ub97c \uc5bb\uace0, \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud560 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Abrate", "Peter Bienstman", "Stefano Di Carlo", "Alessandro Savino Senior"], "title": "LuxIA: A Lightweight Unitary matriX-based Framework Built on an Iterative Algorithm for Photonic Neural Network Training", "comment": null, "summary": "PNNs present promising opportunities for accelerating machine learning by leveraging the unique benefits of photonic circuits. However, current state of the art PNN simulation tools face significant scalability challenges when training large-scale PNNs, due to the computational demands of transfer matrix calculations, resulting in high memory and time consumption. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Slicing method, an efficient transfer matrix computation approach compatible with back-propagation. We integrate this method into LuxIA, a unified simulation and training framework. The Slicing method substantially reduces memory usage and execution time, enabling scalable simulation and training of large PNNs. Experimental evaluations across various photonic architectures and standard datasets, including MNIST, Digits, and Olivetti Faces, show that LuxIA consistently surpasses existing tools in speed and scalability.

The framework identifies reflection as the key mechanism that enables agents to adapt through interaction without back propagation or model fine tuning, thereby relaxing the conventional separation between training and deployment.To formalise this process, we introduce the Stateful Reflective Decision Process, which models reflective learning as a two stage read write interaction with episodic memory. Writing stores interaction outcomes and corresponds to policy evaluation, while reading retrieves relevant past cases and corresponds to policy improvement. We show that this process induces an equivalent Markov decision process over augmented state memory representations, allowing the use of classical tools from dynamic programming and reinforcement learning. We further instantiate the framework using entropy regularised policy iteration and establish convergence guarantees. As episodic memory grows and achieves sufficient coverage of the state space, the resulting policy converges to the optimal solution.

However, like other neural architectures, they remain vulnerable to adversarial manipulations: subtle character-, word-, or phrase-level perturbations can poison retrieval results and artificially promote targeted candidates, undermining the integrity of search engines and downstream systems. Existing defenses either rely on heuristics with poor generalization or on certified methods that assume overly strong adversarial knowledge, limiting their practical use. To address these challenges, we propose RobustMask, a novel defense that combines the context-prediction capability of pretrained language models with a randomized masking-based smoothing mechanism. Our approach strengthens neural ranking models against adversarial perturbations at the character, word, and phrase levels. Leveraging both the pairwise comparison ability of ranking models and probabilistic statistical analysis, we provide a theoretical proof of RobustMask's certified top-K robustness. Extensive experiments further demonstrate that RobustMask successfully certifies over 20% of candidate documents within the top-10 ranking positions against adversarial perturbations affecting up to 30% of their content. These results highlight the effectiveness of RobustMask in enhancing the adversarial robustness of neural ranking models, marking a significant step toward providing stronger security guarantees for real-world retrieval systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "RobustMask\ub294 \uc2e0\uacbd \uc21c\uc704 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc870\uc791\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2e0\uacbd \uc21c\uc704 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc5d0 \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub428\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc870\uc791\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "RobustMask\ub294 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ub9e5\ub77d \uc608\uce21 \ub2a5\ub825\uacfc \ubb34\uc791\uc704 \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud0b9 \uae30\ubc18 \uc2a4\ubb34\ub529 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ubc29\uc5b4\ub97c \uad6c\ud604\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "RobustMask\ub294 \ucd5c\ub300 30%\uc758 \ub0b4\uc6a9\uc744 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubc1b\ub294 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uad50\ub780\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc0c1\uc704 10\uc704 \ub0b4\uc758 \ud6c4\ubcf4 \ubb38\uc11c 20% \uc774\uc0c1\uc744 \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "RobustMask\ub294 \uc2e0\uacbd \uc21c\uc704 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uac15\uc778\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba70, \uc2e4\uc81c \uac80\uc0c9 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub2e8\uacc4\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc2e0\uacbd \uc21c\uc704 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ub180\ub77c\uc6b4 \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \ud604\uc7ac \uc815\ubcf4 \uac80\uc0c9 \uc99d\ub300 \uc0dd\uc131(RAG)\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc5d0 \ub110\ub9ac \ubc30\ud3ec\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ub2e4\ub978 \uc2e0\uacbd \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc640 \ub9c8\ucc2c\uac00\uc9c0\ub85c \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc870\uc791\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubbf8\uc138\ud55c \ubb38\uc790, \ub2e8\uc5b4 \ub610\ub294 \uad6c\uc758 \ubcc0\ud615\uc774 \uac80\uc0c9 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc624\uc5fc\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \ubaa9\ud45c \ud6c4\ubcf4\ub97c \uc778\uc704\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud64d\ubcf4\ud558\uc5ec \uac80\uc0c9 \uc5d4\uc9c4\uacfc \ud558\uc704 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ubb34\uacb0\uc131\uc744 \uc800\ud574\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubc29\uc5b4\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\uac00 \uc88b\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc9c0\ub098\uce58\uac8c \uac15\ud55c \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uac00\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc778\uc99d \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc5d0 \uc81c\ud55c\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ub9e5\ub77d \uc608\uce21 \ub2a5\ub825\uacfc \ubb34\uc791\uc704 \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud0b9 \uae30\ubc18 \uc2a4\ubb34\ub529 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\uc5b4\uc778 RobustMask\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ubb38\uc790, \ub2e8\uc5b4 \ubc0f \uad6c \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uad50\ub780\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e0\uacbd \uc21c\uc704 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc21c\uc704 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc30d \ube44\uad50 \ub2a5\ub825\uacfc \ud655\ub960\uc801 \ud1b5\uacc4 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec RobustMask\uc758 \uc778\uc99d\ub41c \uc0c1\uc704 K \uac15\uc778\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc99d\uba85\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc740 RobustMask\uac00 \ucd5c\ub300 30%\uc758 \ucf58\ud150\uce20\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc8fc\ub294 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uad50\ub780\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc0c1\uc704 10\uc704\uc758 \ud6c4\ubcf4 \ubb38\uc11c 20% \uc774\uc0c1\uc744 \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc2e0\uacbd \uc21c\uc704 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uac15\uc778\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 RobustMask\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70, \uc2e4\uc81c \uac80\uc0c9 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ubcf4\uc548 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc9c4\uc804\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Consequently, comprehensive testing methodologies are essential to evaluate the performance of autonomous vehicles in diverse and complex real-world scenarios. This study focuses on the behaviour coverage analysis of a multi-agent system simulation designed for autonomous vehicle testing, and provides a systematic approach to measure and assess behaviour coverage within the simulation environment. By defining a set of driving scenarios, and agent interactions, we evaluate the extent to which the simulation encompasses a broad range of behaviours relevant to autonomous driving.\n  Our findings highlight the importance of behaviour coverage in validating the effectiveness and robustness of autonomous vehicle systems. Through the analysis of behaviour coverage metrics and coverage-based testing, we identify key areas for improvement and optimization in the simulation framework.

Temporal motifs, as an elementary unit and important local property of dynamic graphs which can directly reflect anomalies and unique phenomena, are essential for understanding their evolutionary dynamics and structural features. However, leveraging LLMs for temporal motif analysis on dynamic graphs remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we systematically study LLM performance on temporal motif-related tasks. Specifically, we propose a comprehensive benchmark, LLMTM (Large Language Models in Temporal Motifs), which includes six tailored tasks across nine temporal motif types. We then conduct extensive experiments to analyze the impacts of different prompting techniques and LLMs (including nine models: openPangu-7B, the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen series, Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, GPT-4o-mini, DeepSeek-R1, and o3) on model performance. Informed by our benchmark findings, we develop a tool-augmented LLM agent that leverages precisely engineered prompts to solve these tasks with high accuracy. Nevertheless, the high accuracy of the agent incurs a substantial cost. To address this trade-off, we propose a simple yet effective structure-aware dispatcher that considers both the dynamic graph's structural properties and the LLM's cognitive load to intelligently dispatch queries between the standard LLM prompting and the more powerful agent. Our experiments demonstrate that the structure-aware dispatcher effectively maintains high accuracy while reducing cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub300\ud615

We propose a Segmented Allocation with Momentum-Adjusted Utility for Multi-agent Portfolio Management via Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning (SAMP-HDRL). The framework first applies dynamic asset grouping to partition the market into high-quality and ordinary subsets. An upper-level agent extracts global market signals, while lower-level agents perform intra-group allocation under mask constraints. A utility-based capital allocation mechanism integrates risky and risk-free assets, ensuring coherent coordination between global and local decisions. backtests across three market regimes (2019--2021) demonstrate that SAMP-HDRL consistently outperforms nine traditional baselines and nine DRL benchmarks under volatile and oscillating conditions. Compared with the strongest baseline, our method achieves at least 5\\% higher Return, 5\\% higher Sharpe ratio, 5\\% higher Sortino ratio, and 2\\% higher Omega ratio, with substantially larger gains observed in turbulent markets. Ablation studies confirm that upper--lower coordination, dynamic clustering, and capital allocation are indispensable to robustness.

The available frameworks like SLSA, SBOM and in toto are majorly used to offer provenance and traceability but do not have the capabilities of actively identifying and removing vulnerabilities in software production. The current paper includes an example of agentic artificial intelligence (AI) based on autonomous software supply chain security that combines large language model (LLM)-based reasoning, reinforcement learning (RL), and multi-agent coordination. The suggested system utilizes specialized security agents coordinated with the help of LangChain and LangGraph, communicates with actual CI/CD environments with the Model Context Protocol (MCP), and documents all the observations and actions in a blockchain security ledger to ensure integrity and auditing. Reinforcement learning can be used to achieve adaptive mitigation strategies that consider the balance between security effectiveness and the operational overhead, and LLMs can be used to achieve semantic vulnerability analysis, as well as explainable decisions. This framework is tested based on simulated pipelines, as well as, actual world CI/CD integrations on GitHub Actions and Jenkins, including injection attacks, insecure deserialization, access control violations, and configuration errors. Experimental outcomes indicate better detection accuracy, shorter mitigation latency and reasonable build-time overhead than rule-based, provenance only and RL only baselines.

Code available at https://github.com/RH2004/QMOE", "summary": "The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture has emerged as a powerful paradigm for scaling deep learning models, yet it is fundamentally limited by challenges such as expert imbalance and the computational complexity of classical routing mechanisms. This paper investigates the potential of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) to address these limitations through a novel Hybrid Quantum-Classical Mixture of Experts (QMoE) architecture. Specifically, we conduct an ablation study using a Quantum Gating Network (Router) combined with classical experts to isolate the source of quantum advantage. Our central finding validates the Interference Hypothesis: by leveraging quantum feature maps (Angle Embedding) and wave interference, the Quantum Router acts as a high-dimensional kernel method, enabling the modeling of complex, non-linear decision boundaries with superior parameter efficiency compared to its classical counterparts. Experimental results on non-linearly separable data, such as the Two Moons dataset, demonstrate that the Quantum Router achieves a significant topological advantage, effectively \"untangling\" data distributions that linear classical routers fail to separate efficiently. Furthermore, we analyze the architecture's robustness against simulated quantum noise, confirming its feasibility for near-term intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. We discuss practical applications in federated learning, privacy-preserving machine learning, and adaptive systems that could benefit from this quantum-enhanced routing paradigm.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc591\uc790 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5(QML)\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc591\uc790-\uace0\uc804 \ud63c\ud569 \uc804\ubb38\uac00(QMoE) \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \ud63c\ud569 \uc804\ubb38\uac00(MoE) \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud63c\ud569 \uc804\ubb38\uac00(MoE) \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4, \ud2b9\ud788 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \ubd88\uade0\ud615\uacfc \uc804\ud1b5\uc801 \ub77c\uc6b0\ud305 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ubaa8\uc0c9\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": " \uc591\uc790 \uac8c\uc774\ud305 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c(\ub77c\uc6b0\ud130)\ub97c \uace0\uc804 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc640 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc591\uc790 \uc774\uc810\uc758 \ucd9c\ucc98\ub97c \uace0\ub9bd\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ud0c8\ucc29 \uc5f0\uad6c(ablation study)\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc591\uc790 \uac8c\uc774\ud130\uac00 \uc120\ud615 \uace0\uc804 \ub77c\uc6b0\ud130\ub85c\ub294 \ubd84\ub9ac\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \ube44\uc120\ud615 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c '\ud480\uc5b4\ub0b4\ub294' \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc704\uc0c1\uc801 \uc774\uc810\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub294 \uadfc\uc2dc\uc77c \ub0b4\uc5d0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc911\uac04 \uaddc\ubaa8 \uc591\uc790(NISQ) \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uba70, \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5, \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ub4f1 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0 \ud65c\uc6a9\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ub17c\uc758\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud63c\ud569 \uc804\ubb38\uac00(MoE) \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub294 \ub525 \ub7ec\ub2dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc73c\ub85c \ub5a0\uc62c\ub790\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \ubd88\uade0\ud615 \ubc0f \uace0\uc804 \ub77c\uc6b0\ud305 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc758 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ub3c4\uc804\uc5d0 \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ubc1b\ub294\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc591\uc790-\uace0\uc804 \ud63c\ud569 \uc804\ubb38\uac00(QMoE) \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc591\uc790 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5(QML)\uc774 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4. \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc591\uc790 \uae30\ub2a5 \ub9f5(\uac01\ub3c4 \uc784\ubca0\ub529)\uacfc \ud30c\ub3d9 \uac04\uc12d\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc591\uc790 \ub77c\uc6b0\ud130\uac00 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \ucee4\ub110 \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud558\ub294 \ud0c8\ucc29 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4. \ube44\uc120\ud615\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ub9ac \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc591\uc790 \ub77c\uc6b0\ud130\ub294 \uc120\ud615 \uace0\uc804 \ub77c\uc6b0\ud130\uac00 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c '\ud480\uc5b4\ub0b4\ub294' \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc704\uc0c1\uc801 \uc774\uc810\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc758 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ub41c \uc591\uc790 \ub178\uc774\uc988\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacac\uace0\uc131\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc5ec, NISQ \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud604 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \uc591\uc790 \uae30\ubc18 \ub77c\uc6b0\ud305 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc774 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5, \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc0f \uc801\uc751 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc751\uc6a9\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ub17c\uc758\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

Existing approaches, including large vision language models (LVLMs) and deep multimodal fusion methods, often fall short due to limited reasoning and shallow evidence utilization. A key bottleneck is the lack of dedicated datasets that provide complete real-world multimodal misinformation instances accompanied by annotated reasoning processes and verifiable evidence. To address this limitation, we introduce RW-Post, a high-quality and explainable dataset for real-world multimodal fact-checking. RW-Post aligns real-world multimodal claims with their original social media posts, preserving the rich contextual information in which the claims are made. In addition, the dataset includes detailed reasoning and explicitly linked evidence, which are derived from human written fact-checking articles via a large language model assisted extraction pipeline, enabling comprehensive verification and explanation. Building upon RW-Post, we propose AgentFact, an agent-based multimodal fact-checking framework designed to emulate the human verification workflow. AgentFact consists of five specialized agents that collaboratively handle key fact-checking subtasks, including strategy planning, high-quality evidence retrieval, visual analysis, reasoning, and explanation generation. These agents are orchestrated through an iterative workflow that alternates between evidence searching and task-aware evidence filtering and reasoning, facilitating strategic decision-making and systematic evidence analysis. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the synergy between RW-Post and AgentFact substantially improves both the accuracy and interpretability of multimodal fact-checking.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud615\ud0dc\uc758 \ud5c8\uc704\uc815\ubcf4 \ud655\uc0b0\uc774 \uc790\ub3d9 Fact-checking \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc73c\ub85c RW-Post\ub77c\ub294 \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uacfc AgentFact\ub77c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 Fact-checking \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud615\ud0dc\uc758 \ud5c8\uc704\uc815\ubcf4\uac00 \uc790\ub3d9 Fact-checking \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ud070 \ub3c4\uc804\uc774 \ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \uc595\uc740 \uc99d\uac70 \ud65c\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ud55c\uacc4\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "RW-Post \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c AgentFact\ub77c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec Fact-checking \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc12f \uac1c\uc758 \uc804\ubb38 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc804\ub7b5 \uae30\ud68d, \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \uc99d\uac70 \uac80\uc0c9, \uc2dc\uac01 \ubd84\uc11d \ub4f1 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ud558\uc704 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud611\ub825\ud558\uc5ec \ucc98\ub9ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "RW-Post\uc640 AgentFact\uc758 \uc2dc\ub108\uc9c0\uac00 \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec Fact-checking\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131 \ubc0f \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b4\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\ub294 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "RW-Post\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec Fact-checking\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, AgentFact\ub294 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uac80\uc99d \uc791\uc5c5 \ud750\ub984\uc744 \ubaa8\ubc29\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c\uc11c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud615\ud0dc\uc758 \ud5c8\uc704 \uc815\ubcf4\uc758 \uae09\uc18d\ud55c \ud655\uc0b0\uc740 \uc790\ub3d9 \uc0ac\uc2e4 \ud655\uc778 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc99d\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uc81c\uae30\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd, \ub300\ud615 \ube44\uc804 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LVLM) \ubc0f \uc2ec\uce35 \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \uc735\ud569 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uc5ec, \uc885\uc885 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \uc595\uc740 \uc99d\uac70 \ud65c\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ubd80\uc871\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc8fc\uc694 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc740 \uc8fc\uc11d\uc774 \ub2ec\ub9b0 \ucd94\ub860 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \ubc0f \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc99d\uac70\uc640 \ud568\uaed8 \uc804\uccb4 \uc2e4\uc81c \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \ud5c8\uc704 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc0ac\ub840\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \uc804\uc6a9 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc758 \ubd80\uc871\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc81c\ud55c\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \uc0ac\uc2e4 \ud655\uc778\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uace0\ud488\uc9c8\uc758 \uc124\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc778 RW-Post\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Nevertheless, this agentic environment increases the probability of the occurrence of multimodal prompt injection (PI) attacks, in which concealed or malicious instructions carried in text, pictures, metadata, or agent-to-agent messages may spread throughout the graph and lead to unintended behavior, a breach of policy, or corruption of state. In order to mitigate these risks, this paper suggests a Cross-Agent Multimodal Provenanc- Aware Defense Framework whereby all the prompts, either user-generated or produced by upstream agents, are sanitized and all the outputs generated by an LLM are verified independently before being sent to downstream nodes. This framework contains a Text sanitizer agent, visual sanitizer agent, and output validator agent all coordinated by a provenance ledger, which keeps metadata of modality, source, and trust level throughout the entire agent network. This architecture makes sure that agent-to-agent communication abides by clear trust frames such such that injected instructions are not propagated down LangChain or GraphChain-style-workflows. The experimental assessments show that multimodal injection detection accuracy is significantly enhanced, and the cross-agent trust leakage is minimized, as well as, agentic execution pathways become stable.

First, a cross-model attention mechanism enables successor models to access and fuse hidden states from predecessors, facilitating hierarchical error correction and knowledge transfer. Second, a chain training paradigm progressively fine-tunes connected models with an error-suppression objective, ensuring that each model rectifies the mispredictions of its predecessor with minimal additional computation. Third, a near-parallel inference paradigm design pipelines hidden states across models layer by layer, achieving inference efficiency approaching single-model decoding. We further establish the theoretical foundations of LLMBoost, proving that sequential integration guarantees monotonic improvements under bounded correction assumptions. Extensive experiments on commonsense reasoning and arithmetic reasoning tasks demonstrate that LLMBoost consistently boosts accuracy while reducing inference latency.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMBoost\ub294 LLM\uc758 \uc911\uac04 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc559\uc0c1\ube14 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 \uc559\uc0c1\ube14 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ube14\ub799 \ubc15\uc2a4\ub85c \ucde8\uae09\ud558\uba70, \ub0b4\ubd80 \ud45c\ud604\uacfc \ubaa8\ub378 \uac04 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uac04\uacfc\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "LLMBoost\ub294 \uad50\ucc28 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc8fc\uc758 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998, \uccb4\uc778 \ud6c8\ub828 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784, \uadfc\uc811 \ubcd1\ub82c \ucd94\ub860 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc758 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \ud601\uc2e0\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c LLMBoost\ub294 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \ucd94\ub860 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc744 \uc904\uc774\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774\ub860\uc801 \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \ud655\ub9bd\ud558\uace0, \uc5f0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ud1b5\ud569\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc218\uc815 \uac00\uc815 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e8\uc870\ub85c\uc6b4 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc559\uc0c1\ube14 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 LLM(\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378)\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \ub300\uc548\uc73c\ub85c \ubd80\uc0c1\ud588\uc73c\ub098, \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ube14\ub799 \ubc15\uc2a4\ub85c \ucde8\uae09\ud558\uace0, \ucd5c\uc885 \ucd9c\ub825\uc774\ub098 \uc785\ub825\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uadf8\uce58\uba70, \ubaa8\ub378 \uac04\uc758 \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \ub0b4\ubd80 \ud45c\ud604\uacfc \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uac04\uacfc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 LLM\uc758 \uc911\uac04 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \uba85\ud655\ud788 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc7a5\ubcbd\uc744 \uae68\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc559\uc0c1\ube14 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 LLMBoost\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubd80\uc2a4\ud305 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc5d0\uc11c \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc544 LLMBoost\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \ud601\uc2e0\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uccab\uc9f8, \uad50\ucc28 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc8fc\uc758 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc740 \ud6c4\uc18d \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc120\ud589 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc228\uaca8\uc9c4 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0 \uc811\uadfc\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \uc735\ud569\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec, \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc624\ub958 \uc218\uc815 \ubc0f \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc804\uc774\ub97c \ucd09\uc9c4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub458\uc9f8, \uccb4\uc778 \ud6c8\ub828 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc740 \uc624\ub958 \uc5b5\uc81c \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc5f0\uacb0\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc810\uc9c4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ud558\uc5ec, \uac01 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud55c\uc758 \ucd94\uac00 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc73c\ub85c \uc120\ud589 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc218\uc815\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc14b\uc9f8, \uadfc\uc811 \ubcd1\ub82c \ucd94\ub860 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784 \ub514\uc790\uc778\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378 \uac04\uc5d0 \uc228\uaca8\uc9c4 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \uacc4\uce35\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\uc5ec, \ub2e8\uc77c \ubaa8\ub378 \ub514\ucf54\ub529\uc5d0 \uac00\uae4c\uc6b4 \ucd94\ub860 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c LLMBoost\uc758 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \ud655\ub9bd\ud558\uace0, \uc21c\ucc28\uc801\uc778 \ud1b5\ud569\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc218\uc815 \uac00\uc815 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e8\uc870\ub85c\uc6b4 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc77c\ubc18 \uc0c1\uc2dd \ucd94\ub860\uacfc \uc0b0\uc220 \ucd94\ub860 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc740 LLMBoost\uac00 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ub192\uc774\ub294 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ucd94\ub860 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc744 \uc904\uc778\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

We introduce ChexReason, a vision-language model trained via R1-style methodology (SFT followed by GRPO) using only 2,000 SFT samples, 1,000 RL samples, and a single A100 GPU. Evaluations on CheXpert and NIH benchmarks reveal a fundamental tension: GRPO recovers in-distribution performance (23% improvement on CheXpert, macro-F1 = 0.346) but degrades cross-dataset transferability (19% drop on NIH). This mirrors high-resource models like NV-Reason-CXR-3B, suggesting the issue stems from the RL paradigm rather than scale. We identify a generalization paradox where the SFT checkpoint uniquely improves on NIH before optimization, indicating teacher-guided reasoning captures more institution-agnostic features. Furthermore, cross-model comparisons show structured reasoning scaffolds benefit general-purpose VLMs but offer minimal gain for medically pre-trained models.

This paper develops AMBIT, a gray-box framework that augments physical mobility baselines with interpretable tree models. We begin with a comprehensive audit of classical spatial interaction models on a year-long, hourly NYC taxi OD dataset. The audit shows that most physical models are fragile at this temporal resolution; PPML gravity is the strongest physical baseline, while constrained variants improve when calibrated on full OD margins but remain notably weaker. We then build residual learners on top of physical baselines using gradient-boosted trees and SHAP analysis, demonstrating that (i) physics-grounded residuals approach the accuracy of a strong tree-based predictor while retaining interpretable structure, and (ii) POI-anchored residuals are consistently competitive and most robust under spatial generalization.

While search algorithms like Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) can explore alternatives, they are often ineffective when guided by sparse rewards and fail to leverage the rich semantic capabilities of LLMs. We introduce SPIRAL (Symbolic LLM Planning via Grounded and Reflective Search), a novel framework that embeds a cognitive architecture of three specialized LLM agents into an MCTS loop. SPIRAL's key contribution is its integrated planning pipeline where a Planner proposes creative next steps, a Simulator grounds the search by predicting realistic outcomes, and a Critic provides dense reward signals through reflection. This synergy transforms MCTS from a brute-force search into a guided, self-correcting reasoning process. On the DailyLifeAPIs and HuggingFace datasets, SPIRAL consistently outperforms the default Chain-of-Thought planning method and other state-of-the-art agents. More importantly, it substantially surpasses other state-of-the-art agents; for example, SPIRAL achieves 83.6% overall accuracy on DailyLifeAPIs, an improvement of over 16 percentage points against the next-best search framework, while also demonstrating superior token efficiency.

Yet, new target domains often require domain expansion: a generalized model that performs well beyond any single specialist's domain. Given such a new target domain, prior works seek a single strong initialization prior for the model parameters by first blending expert models to initialize a target model. However, heuristic blending -- using coefficients based on data size or proxy metrics -- often yields lower target-domain test accuracy, and learning the coefficients on the target loss typically requires computationally-expensive full backpropagation through the network. We propose GLUE, Gradient-free Learning To Unify Experts, which initializes the target model as a convex combination of fixed experts, learning the mixture coefficients of this combination via a gradient-free two-point (SPSA) update that requires only two forward passes per step. Across experiments on three datasets and three network architectures, GLUE produces a single prior that can be fine-tuned effectively to outperform baselines. GLUE improves test accuracy by up to 8.5% over data-size weighting and by up to 9.1% over proxy-metric selection. GLUE either outperforms backpropagation-based full-gradient mixing or matches its performance within 1.4%.", "AI": {"tldr": "GLUE\ub294 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc870\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ud0c0\uac9f \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ucd08\uae30\ud654\ud558\uace0, \ub450 \ubc88\uc758 \uc21c\ubc29\ud5a5 \ud328\uc2a4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud63c\ud569 \uacc4\uc218\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \uae30\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c, \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud0c0\uac9f \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc744 \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud560 \ub54c, \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud63c\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ucd08\uae30\ud654\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "GLUE\ub294 \uace0\uc815\ub41c \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ubcfc\ub85d \uc870\ud569\uc73c\ub85c \ud0c0\uac9f \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ucd08\uae30\ud654\ud558\uace0, \uacbd\ub7c9\uc758 \ub450 \uc810 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8(SPSA)\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud63c\ud569 \uacc4\uc218\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "GLUE\ub294 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 8.5%\uae4c\uc9c0, \ud504\ub85d\uc2dc \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad \uc120\ud0dd\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 9.1%\uae4c\uc9c0 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf30\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "GLUE\ub294 \ubc31\ud504\ub85c\ud30c\uac8c\uc774\uc158 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc804\uccb4 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \ud63c\ud569 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub9ce\uc740 \ubc30\ud3ec \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(\ub2e4\uad6d\uc5b4 ASR, \ubcd1\uc6d0 \uac04 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0, \uc9c0\uc5ed\ubcc4 \uc778\uc2dd)\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uac1c\uc758 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uacf5\uc874\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubaa9\ud45c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud655\uc7a5\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc989, \ub2e8\uc77c \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc758 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc744 \ub118\uc5b4 \uc798 \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubaa9\ud45c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc774\uc804 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub4e4\uc740 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud63c\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa9\ud45c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ucd08\uae30\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub2e8\uc77c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ucd08\uae30\ud654 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\uc5b4\ub97c \uad00\uacc4\ub85c \uc124\uc815\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud06c\uae30\ub098 \ud504\ub85d\uc2dc \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1 \ud63c\ud569\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \ubaa9\ud45c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uac00 \ub0ae\uac8c \ub098\ud0c0\ub098\uba70, \ubaa9\ud45c \uc190\uc2e4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacc4\uc218\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \uacfc\uc815\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4dc\ub294 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \uc644\uc804 \uc5ed\uc804\ud30c\ub97c \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 GLUE, \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \ud1b5\ud569\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uc5c6\ub294 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Thermal comfort, a sophisticated interplay of environmental factors and personal perceptions involving sensory integration and adaptive decision-making, serves as an ideal paradigm for evaluating real-world cognitive capabilities of AI systems. To address this, we propose TCEval, the first evaluation framework that assesses three core cognitive capacities of AI, cross-modal reasoning, causal association, and adaptive decision-making, by leveraging thermal comfort scenarios and large language model (LLM) agents. The methodology involves initializing LLM agents with virtual personality attributes, guiding them to generate clothing insulation selections and thermal comfort feedback, and validating outputs against the ASHRAE Global Database and Chinese Thermal Comfort Database. Experiments on four LLMs show that while agent feedback has limited exact alignment with humans, directional consistency improves significantly with a 1 PMV tolerance. Statistical tests reveal that LLM-generated PMV distributions diverge markedly from human data, and agents perform near-randomly in discrete thermal comfort classification. These results confirm the feasibility of TCEval as an ecologically valid Cognitive Turing Test for AI, demonstrating that current LLMs possess foundational cross-modal reasoning ability but lack precise causal understanding of the nonlinear relationships between variables in thermal comfort. TCEval complements traditional benchmarks, shifting AI evaluation focus from abstract task proficiency to embodied, context-aware perception and decision-making, offering valuable insights for advancing AI in human-centric applications like smart buildings.", "AI": {"tldr": "TCEval\uc740 AI\uc758 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud575\uc2ec \uc778\uc9c0 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c\uc11c, \uc2e4\uc81c\uc801\uc778 \uc5f4\uc801 \ucf8c\uc801\uc131\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc778\uc9c0 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc810\uac80\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM\uc758 \uc791\uc5c5\ubcc4 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uaca9\ucc28\uac00 \uc874\uc7ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5f4\uc801 \ucf8c\uc801\uc131\uc740 \ud658\uacbd \uc694\uc778\uacfc \uac1c\uc778\uc758 \uc778\uc2dd \uac04\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc0c1\ud638 \uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uba70, AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc778\uc9c0 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc774\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "TCEval\uc740 \uac00\uc0c1\uc758 \uac1c\uc778\uc801 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ucd08\uae30\ud654\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub4e4\uc774 \uc758\ub958 \ub2e8\uc5f4 \uc120\ud0dd\uacfc \uc5f4\uc801 \ucf8c\uc801\uc131 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\uba70, ASHRAE \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ubca0\uc774\uc2a4 \ubc0f \uc911\uad6d \uc5f4\uc801 \ucf8c\uc801\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ubca0\uc774\uc2a4\uc640 \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc740 \uc778\uac04\uacfc\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc815\ub82c\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, 1 PMV \ud5c8\uc6a9\uc624\ucc28\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc29\ud5a5\uc758 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc774 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \uac1c\uc120\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud1b5\uacc4 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uacb0\uacfc, LLM\uc774 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c PMV \ubd84\ud3ec\ub294 \uc778\uac04 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \ud604\uc800\ud788 \ub2e4\ub974\uace0, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc774\uc0b0 \uc5f4\uc801 \ucf8c\uc801\uc131 \ubd84\ub958\uc5d0\uc11c \uac70\uc758 \ubb34\uc791\uc704\ub85c \uc791\ub3d9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "TCEval\uc740 AI\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0dd\ud0dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\ud6a8\ud55c \uc778\uc9c0 \ud29c\ub9c1 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc758 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud558\uba70, \ud604\uc7ac LLMs\uac00 \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uad50\ucc28 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc720\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc5f4\uc801 \ucf8c\uc801\uc131 \ubcc0\uc218 \uac04 \ube44\uc120\ud615 \uad00\uacc4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc778\uacfc\uc801 \uc774\ud574\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, this presents three key system challenges - model architecture diversity, kernel primitive diversity, and hardware generation and architecture heterogeneity. This paper presents KernelEvolve-an agentic kernel coding framework-to tackle heterogeneity at-scale for DLRM. KernelEvolve is designed to take kernel specifications as input and automate the process of kernel generation and optimization for recommendation model across heterogeneous hardware architectures. KernelEvolve does so by operating at multiple programming abstractions, from Triton and CuTe DSL to low-level hardware agnostic languages, spanning the full hardware-software optimization stack. The kernel optimization process is described as graph-based search with selection policy, universal operator, fitness function, and termination rule, dynamically adapts to runtime execution context through retrieval-augmented prompt synthesis. We designed, implemented, and deployed KernelEvolve to optimize a wide variety of production recommendation models across generations of NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, as well as Meta's AI accelerators. We validate KernelEvolve on the publicly-available KernelBench suite, achieving 100% pass rate on all 250 problems across three difficulty levels, and 160 PyTorch ATen operators across three heterogeneous hardware platforms, demonstrating 100% correctness.

However, many real-world tasks involve multi-stage pipeline whose final outcomes lack verifiable rewards or sufficient data to train robust reward models, making judge-based refinement prone to accumulate error over stages. We propose Selective TTS, a process-based refinement framework that scales inference across different stages in multi-agent pipeline, instead of repeated refinement over time by prior work. By distributing compute across stages and pruning low-quality branches early using process-specific judges, Selective TTS mitigates the judge drift and stabilizes refinement. Grounded in the data science pipeline, we build an end-to-end multi-agent pipeline for generating visually insightful charts and report of given dataset, and design a reliable LLM-based judge model, aligned with human experts (Kendall's \u03c4=0.55). Our proposed selective TTS then improves insight quality under a fixed compute budget, increasing mean scores from 61.64 to 65.86 while reducing variance. We hope our findings serve as the first step toward to scaling complex, open-ended tasks with unverifiable rewards, such as scientific discovery and story generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Selective

Recent benchmarks show that even frontier vision-language models achieve only 50-53% accuracy on basic quantitative physics tasks, behaving as approximate guessers that preserve semantic plausibility while violating physical constraints. This input unfaithfulness is not a scaling deficiency but a structural limitation. Perception-centric architectures optimize parameter-space imitation, whereas safety-critical control demands outcome-space guarantees over executed actions. Here, we present a fundamentally different pathway toward domain-specific foundation models by introducing compact language models operating as Agentic Physical AI, in which policy optimization is driven by physics-based validation rather than perceptual inference. We train a 360-million-parameter model on synthetic reactor control scenarios, scaling the dataset from 10^3 to 10^5 examples. This induces a sharp phase transition absent in general-purpose models. Small-scale systems exhibit high-variance imitation with catastrophic tail risk, while large-scale models undergo variance collapse exceeding 500x reduction, stabilizing execution-level behavior. Despite balanced exposure to four actuation families, the model autonomously rejects approximately 70% of the training distribution and concentrates 95% of runtime execution on a single-bank strategy. Learned representations transfer across distinct physics and continuous input modalities without architectural modification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubb3c\ub9ac \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c

However, existing approaches treat summary actions as standard actions, overlooking that summaries fundamentally modify the agent's future observation space, creating a policy-dependent, non-stationary observation distribution that violates core RL assumptions. This introduces three fundamental challenges: (1) gradient dilution where summary tokens receive insufficient training signal, (2) self-conditioning where policy updates change summary distributions, creating a vicious cycle of training collapse, and (3) computational cost from processing unique contexts at each turn. We introduce \\textbf{FoldAct}\\footnote{https://github.com/SHAO-Jiaqi757/FoldAct}, a framework that explicitly addresses these challenges through three key innovations: separated loss computation for independent gradient signals on summary and action tokens, full context consistency loss to reduce distribution shift, and selective segment training to reduce computational cost.

We identify three core cognitive challenges hindering this transition: spatial reasoning, long-horizon state tracking via mental simulation, and active exploration under partial observation. To isolate and evaluate these faculties, we introduce CubeBench, a novel generative benchmark centered on the Rubik's Cube. CubeBench uses a three-tiered diagnostic framework that progressively assesses agent capabilities, from foundational state tracking with full symbolic information to active exploration with only partial visual data. Our experiments on leading LLMs reveal critical limitations, including a uniform 0.00% pass rate on all long-horizon tasks, exposing a fundamental failure in long-term planning.

Assuming the platform is a revenue maximizer, it observes market features that generally affect demand. Since only the equilibrium price and quantity are observable, this presents a general demand learning problem under confounding. Mathematically, we develop an algorithm with optimal regret of $\\Tilde{\\cO}(\\sqrt{T}\\wedge\u03c3_S^{-2})$. Our results reveal that supply-side noise fundamentally affects the learnability of demand, leading to a phase transition in regret. Technically, we show that non-i.i.d. actions can serve as instrumental variables for learning demand. We also propose a novel homeomorphic construction that allows us to establish estimation bounds without assuming star-shapedness, providing the first efficiency guarantee for learning demand with deep neural networks.

Tool-integrated reasoning (TIR) agents capable of autonomous reasoning and tool invocation are rapidly emerging as a powerful approach for complex decision-making tasks involving multi-step interactions with external environments. In this work, we introduce MindWatcher, a TIR agent integrating interleaved thinking and multimodal chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. MindWatcher can autonomously decide whether and how to invoke diverse tools and coordinate their use, without relying on human prompts or workflows. The interleaved thinking paradigm enables the model to switch between thinking and tool calling at any intermediate stage, while its multimodal CoT capability allows manipulation of images during reasoning to yield more precise search results. We implement automated data auditing and evaluation pipelines, complemented by manually curated high-quality datasets for training, and we construct a benchmark, called MindWatcher-Evaluate Bench (MWE-Bench), to evaluate its performance. MindWatcher is equipped with a comprehensive suite of auxiliary reasoning tools, enabling it to address broad-domain multimodal problems. A large-scale, high-quality local image retrieval database, covering eight categories including cars, animals, and plants, endows model with robust object recognition despite its small size. Finally, we design a more efficient training infrastructure for MindWatcher, enhancing training speed and hardware utilization. Experiments not only demonstrate that MindWatcher matches or exceeds the performance of larger or more recent models through superior tool invocation, but also uncover critical insights for agent training, such as the genetic inheritance phenomenon in agentic RL.", "AI": {"tldr": "MindWatcher\ub294 \uc790\uc728\uc801 \ub3c4\uad6c \ud638\ucd9c \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \uac16\ucd98 TIR \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c, \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\uba70, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud604\uc2e4 \uc138\uacc4 \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0\uc5d0\uc11c \ub3c4\uad6c \ud638\ucd9c\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ub354 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131.", "method": "MindWatcher\ub294 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc0ac\uace0\uc640 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uccb4\uc778 \uc624\ube0c \uc0ac\uace0(CoT) \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c TIR \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ub3c4\uad6c \ud638\ucd9c\uc744 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uacb0\uc815\ud558\uace0 \uc870\uc815\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc9c0\ub2c8\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "MindWatcher\ub294 \ub354 \ud06c\uac70\ub098 \ucd5c\uc2e0 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud560 \ub54c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c \ud638\ucd9c\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc77c\uce58\uc2dc\ud0a4\uac70\ub098 \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\ub294 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "MindWatcher\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \ubcf4\uc870 \ucd94\ub860 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \uac16\ucd94\uace0 \uc788\uc5b4 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uba70, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud6c8\ub828\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ub3c4\uad6c \ud638\ucd9c\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ud604\uc2e4 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \ub3c4\uad6c \ud638\ucd9c\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c \ud1b5\ud569 \ucd94\ub860(TIR) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc678\ubd80 \ud658\uacbd\uacfc\uc758 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \ube60\ub974\uac8c \ubd80\uc0c1\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uc0ac\uace0\uc640 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uccb4\uc778 \uc624\ube0c \uc0ac\uace0(CoT) \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c TIR \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc778 MindWatcher\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, uniform goal selection often results in sample inefficiency in multi-goal settings where agents must learn a universal goal-conditioned policy. Inspired by the adaptive and structured learning processes observed in biological systems, we propose a novel Student-Teacher learning paradigm with a Temporal Variance-Driven Curriculum to accelerate Goal-Conditioned RL. In this framework, the teacher module dynamically prioritizes goals with the highest temporal variance in the policy's confidence score, parameterized by the state-action value (Q) function. The teacher provides an adaptive and focused learning signal by targeting these high-uncertainty goals, fostering continual and efficient progress. We establish a theoretical connection between the temporal variance of Q-values and the evolution of the policy, providing insights into the method's underlying principles. Our approach is algorithm-agnostic and integrates seamlessly with existing RL frameworks. We demonstrate this through evaluation across 11 diverse robotic manipulation and maze navigation tasks. The results show consistent and notable improvements over state-of-the-art curriculum learning and goal-selection methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 Student-Teacher \ud559\uc2b5 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa9\ud45c \uc870\uac74 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc784.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubaa9\ud45c \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ubcf4\ud3b8\uc801\uc778 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc870\uac74 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud574\uc57c \ud560 \ub54c \uc0d8\ud50c \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud568.", "method": "Temporal Variance-Driven Curriculum\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uad50\uc0ac \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc774 \uc815\ucc45\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub3c4 \uc810\uc218\uc5d0\uc11c \uac00\uc7a5 \ub192\uc740 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \ubd84\uc0b0\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c prioritize\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc9d1\uc911\ub41c \ud559\uc2b5 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud568.", "result": "11\uac1c\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub85c\ubd07 \uc870\uc791 \ubc0f \ubbf8\ub85c \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \ucee4\ub9ac\ud058\ub7fc \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc0f \ubaa9\ud45c \uc120\ud0dd \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uace0 \uc720\uc758\ubbf8\ud55c \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90c.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uae30\uc874 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc640 \ub9e4\ub044\ub7fd\uac8c \ud1b5\ud569\ub418\uba70, Q-value\uc758 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \ubd84\uc0b0\uacfc \uc815\ucc45\uc758 \uc9c4\ud654 \uac04\uc758 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc5f0\uacb0\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud568.", "translated_summary": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc740 \ub2e8\uc77c \ubaa9\ud45c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud070 \uc131\uacf5\uc744 \uac70\ub450\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uade0\uc77c\ud55c \ubaa9\ud45c \uc120\ud0dd\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ubcf4\ud3b8\uc801\uc778 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc870\uac74 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa9\ud45c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0d8\ud50c \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uad00\ucc30\ub418\ub294 \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\uc5d0 \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc544, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc870\uac74 RL\uc744 \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 Student-Teacher \ud559\uc2b5 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uad50\uc0ac \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc740 \uc815\ucc45\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub3c4 \uc810\uc218\uc5d0\uc11c \uac00\uc7a5 \ub192\uc740 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \ubd84\uc0b0\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b0\uc120\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad50\uc0ac\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub192\uc740 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uaca8\ub0e5\ud558\uc5ec \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc9d1\uc911\ub41c \ud559\uc2b5 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Q-value\uc758 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \ubd84\uc0b0\uacfc \uc815\ucc45\uc758 \uc9c4\ud654 \uac04\uc758 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc5f0\uacb0\uc744 \uc218\ub9bd\ud558\uc5ec \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \uae30\ubcf8 \uc6d0\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc5d0 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc774\uba70 \uae30\uc874 RL \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc640 \ub9e4\ub044\ub7fd\uac8c \ud1b5\ud569\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 11\uac1c\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub85c\ubd07 \uc870\uc791 \ubc0f \ubbf8\ub85c \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uba70, \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ucee4\ub9ac\ud058\ub7fc \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc0f \ubaa9\ud45c \uc120\ud0dd \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uace0 \ub208\uc5d0 \ub744\ub294 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

A Computationally-Embedded Perspective on the Big World Hypothesis", "comment": "NeurIPS 2025 (spotlight)", "summary": "Continual learning is often motivated by the idea, known as the big world hypothesis, that \"the world is bigger\" than the agent. Recent problem formulations capture this idea by explicitly constraining an agent relative to the environment. These constraints lead to solutions in which the agent continually adapts to best use its limited capacity, rather than converging to a fixed solution. However, explicit constraints can be ad hoc, difficult to incorporate, and may limit the effectiveness of scaling up the agent's capacity. In this paper, we characterize a problem setting in which an agent, regardless of its capacity, is constrained by being embedded in the environment. In particular, we introduce a computationally-embedded perspective that represents an embedded agent as an automaton simulated within a universal (formal) computer. Such an automaton is always constrained; we prove that it is equivalent to an agent that interacts with a partially observable Markov decision process over a countably infinite state-space. We propose an objective for this setting, which we call interactivity, that measures an agent's ability to continually adapt its behaviour by learning new predictions. We then develop a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm for interactivity-seeking, and use it to construct a synthetic problem to evaluate continual learning capability. Our results show that deep nonlinear networks struggle to sustain interactivity, whereas deep linear networks sustain higher interactivity as capacity increases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774

Leveraging multiple experts offers a solution: deferring uncertain inputs to more capable experts improves reliability, while routing simpler queries to smaller, distilled models enhances efficiency. This motivates the problem of learning with multiple-expert deferral. This thesis presents a comprehensive study of this problem and the related problem of learning with abstention, supported by strong consistency guarantees.\n  First, for learning with abstention (a special case of deferral), we analyze score-based and predictor-rejector formulations in multi-class classification. We introduce new families of surrogate losses and prove strong non-asymptotic, hypothesis set-specific consistency guarantees, resolving two existing open questions. We analyze both single-stage and practical two-stage settings, with experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN demonstrating the superior performance of our algorithms.\n  Second, we address general multi-expert deferral in classification. We design new surrogate losses for both single-stage and two-stage scenarios and prove they benefit from strong $H$-consistency bounds. For the two-stage scenario, we show that our surrogate losses are realizable $H$-consistent for constant cost functions, leading to effective new algorithms.\n  Finally, we introduce a novel framework for regression with deferral to address continuous label spaces. Our versatile framework accommodates multiple experts and various cost structures, supporting both single-stage and two-stage methods. It subsumes recent work on regression with abstention. We propose new surrogate losses with proven $H$-consistency and demonstrate the empirical effectiveness of the resulting algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4

The growing complexity of LLMs, multimodal architectures, and recommendation systems, combined with techniques like sparsity and quantization, creates significant computational challenges. Moreover, frequent hardware updates and diverse chip architectures further complicate this landscape, requiring tailored kernel implementations for each platform. However, manual optimization cannot keep pace with these demands, creating a critical bottleneck in AI system development. Recent advances in LLM code generation capabilities have opened new possibilities for automating kernel development. In this work, we propose AKG kernel agent (AI-driven Kernel Generator), a multi-agent system that automates kernel generation, migration, and performance tuning. AKG kernel agent is designed to support multiple domain-specific languages (DSLs), including Triton, TileLang, CPP, and CUDA-C, enabling it to target different hardware backends while maintaining correctness and portability. The system's modular design allows rapid integration of new DSLs and hardware targets.

However, most existing models are designed for centralized settings, rendering them inapplicable in modern decentralized environments. Moreover, current federated learning approaches often suffer from poor generalization performance due to reliance on unreliable pseudo-labels, and fail to capture the latent correlations amongst heterogeneous clients. To tackle these limitations, this paper proposes a novel framework named Federated Multi-Task Clustering (i.e.,FMTC), which intends to learn personalized clustering models for heterogeneous clients while collaboratively leveraging their shared underlying structure in a privacy-preserving manner. More specifically, the FMTC framework is composed of two main components: client-side personalized clustering module, which learns a parameterized mapping model to support robust out-of-sample inference, bypassing the need for unreliable pseudo-labels; and server-side tensorial correlation module, which explicitly captures the shared knowledge across all clients. This is achieved by organizing all client models into a unified tensor and applying a low-rank regularization to discover their common subspace. To solve this joint optimization problem, we derive an efficient, privacy-preserving distributed algorithm based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers, which decomposes the global problem into parallel local updates on clients and an aggregation step on the server. To the end, several extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed FMTC framework significantly outperforms various baseline and state-of-the-art federated clustering algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubd84\uc0b0 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130\ub9c1 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744

Despite the encouraging results, RL improvement inevitably relies on sampling successful, high-quality responses; however, the initial model often struggles to generate responses that satisfy all constraints due to its limited capabilities, yielding sparse or indistinguishable rewards that impede learning. In this work, we propose Hindsight instruction Replay (HiR), a novel sample-efficient RL framework for complex instruction following tasks, which employs a select-then-rewrite strategy to replay failed attempts as successes based on the constraints that have been satisfied in hindsight. We perform RL on these replayed samples as well as the original ones, theoretically framing the objective as dual-preference learning at both the instruction- and response-level to enable efficient optimization using only a binary reward signal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed HiR yields promising results across different instruction following tasks, while requiring less computational budget.

This study focuses on single-channel electroencephalography (EEG), a practical and widely available signal for automatic sleep staging. Existing approaches face challenges such as class imbalance, limited receptive-field modeling, and insufficient interpretability. This work proposes a context-aware and interpretable framework for single-channel EEG sleep staging, with particular emphasis on improving detection of the N1 stage. Many prior models operate as black boxes with stacked layers, lacking clearly defined and interpretable feature extraction roles.The proposed model combines compact multi-scale feature extraction with temporal modeling to capture both local and long-range dependencies. To address data imbalance, especially in the N1 stage, classweighted loss functions and data augmentation are applied. EEG signals are segmented into sub-epoch chunks, and final predictions are obtained by averaging softmax probabilities across chunks, enhancing contextual representation and robustness.The proposed framework achieves an overall accuracy of 89.72% and a macro-average F1-score of 85.46%. Notably, it attains an F1- score of 61.7% for the challenging N1 stage, demonstrating a substantial improvement over previous methods on the SleepEDF datasets.

Accurately predicting startup success requires synthesizing complex relational evidence, including company disclosures, investor track records, and investment network structures, through explicit reasoning to form coherent, interpretable investment theses. Traditional machine learning and graph neural networks both lack this reasoning capability. Large language models (LLMs) offer strong reasoning but face a modality mismatch with graphs. Recent graph-LLM methods target in-graph tasks where answers lie within the graph, whereas VC prediction is off-graph: the target exists outside the network. The core challenge is selecting graph paths that maximize predictor performance on an external objective while enabling step-by-step reasoning. We present MIRAGE-VC, a multi-perspective retrieval-augmented generation framework that addresses two obstacles: path explosion (thousands of candidate paths overwhelm LLM context) and heterogeneous evidence fusion (different startups need different analytical emphasis). Our information-gain-driven path retriever iteratively selects high-value neighbors, distilling investment networks into compact chains for explicit reasoning. A multi-agent architecture integrates three evidence streams via a learnable gating mechanism based on company attributes. Under strict anti-leakage controls, MIRAGE-VC achieves +5.0% F1 and +16.6% PrecisionAt5, and sheds light on other off-graph prediction tasks such as recommendation and risk assessment.

However, optimizing these metrics present significant computational and statistical challenges. Existing approaches often rely on the characterization of the Bayes-optimal classifier, and use threshold-based methods that first estimate class probabilities and then seek an optimal threshold. This leads to algorithms that are not tailored to restricted hypothesis sets and lack finite-sample performance guarantees. In this work, we introduce principled algorithms for optimizing generalized metrics, supported by $H$-consistency and finite-sample generalization bounds. Our approach reformulates metric optimization as a generalized cost-sensitive learning problem, enabling the design of novel surrogate loss functions with provable $H$-consistency guarantees. Leveraging this framework, we develop new algorithms, METRO (Metric Optimization), with strong theoretical performance guarantees.

We can study this problem through the frameworks of the AI assistance and the AI shutdown games. The AI assistance problem concerns designing an AI agent that helps a human to maximise their utility function(s). However, only the human knows these function(s); the AI assistant must learn them. The shutdown problem instead concerns designing AI agents that: shut down when a shutdown button is pressed; neither try to prevent nor cause the pressing of the shutdown button; and otherwise accomplish their task competently.

While machine learning and deep learning techniques have been applied successfully to cross-sectional classification and prediction tasks, effectively forecasting outcomes in longitudinal imaging studies remains challenging. To address this challenge, we introduce a time-aware graph neural network model with transformer fusion (GNN-TF). This model flexibly integrates both tabular data and dynamic brain connectivity data, leveraging the temporal order of these variables within a coherent framework. By incorporating non-Euclidean and Euclidean sources of information from a longitudinal resting-state fMRI dataset from the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA), the GNN-TF enables a comprehensive analysis that captures critical aspects of longitudinal imaging data. Comparative analyses against a variety of established machine learning and deep learning models demonstrate that GNN-TF outperforms these state-of-the-art methods, delivering superior predictive accuracy for predicting future tobacco usage. The end-to-end, time-aware transformer fusion structure of the proposed GNN-TF model successfully integrates multiple data modalities and leverages temporal dynamics, making it a valuable analytic tool for functional brain imaging studies focused on clinical outcome prediction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ube44\uc720\ud074\ub9ac\ub4dc \ub1cc \uc601\uc0c1 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \uc720\ud074\ub9ac\ub4dc \ud45c \ud615\ud0dc\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub192\uc774\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc758\ub8cc \uc601\uc0c1 \ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0\uc11c \ube44\uc720\ud074\ub9ac\ub4dc \ub1cc \uc601\uc0c1 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \uc720\ud074\ub9ac\ub4dc \ud45c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ud070 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30 \uc735\ud569(transformer fusion) \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c \uc2dc\uac04 \uc778\uc2dd \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "GNN-TF\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \uba38\uc2e0 \ub7ec\ub2dd \ubc0f \ub525 \ub7ec\ub2dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uace0 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \ub3d9\ud5a5\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\ub2a5\uc801 \ub1cc \uc601\uc0c1 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c \ubd84\uc11d \ub3c4\uad6c\ub85c \uc791\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ube44\uc720\ud074\ub9ac\ub4dc \ub1cc \uc601\uc0c1 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \uc784\uc0c1 \ubc0f \uc778\uad6c \ud1b5\uacc4 \uc815\ubcf4\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc720\ud074\ub9ac\ub4dc \ud45c \ud615\uc2dd \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc758\ub8cc \uc601\uc0c1 \ubd84\uc11d, \ud2b9\ud788 \ubbf8\ub798 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uba38\uc2e0 \ub7ec\ub2dd \ubc0f \ub525 \ub7ec\ub2dd \uae30\uc220\uc740 \ub2e8\uba74 \ubd84\ub958 \ubc0f \uc608\uce21 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc801\uc6a9\ub418\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc885\ub2e8\uc801 \uc601\uc0c1 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30 \uc735\ud569(transformer fusion)\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \uc2dc\uac04 \uc778\uc2dd \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \ubaa8\ub378(GNN-TF)\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubcc0\uc218\ub4e4\uc758 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc21c\uc11c\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud45c \ud615\uc2dd \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \ub3d9\uc801 \ub1cc \uc5f0\uacb0 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubaa8\ub450\ub97c \uc720\uc5f0\ud558\uac8c \ud1b5\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubbf8\uad6d \uccad\uc18c\ub144 \uc54c\ucf5c \ubc0f \uc2e0\uacbd \ubc1c\ub2ec \uc5f0\uad6c(NCANDA)\uc758 \uc885\ub2e8\uc801 \uc548\uc815 \uc0c1\ud0dc fMRI \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \ube44\uc720\ud074\ub9ac\ub4dc \ubc0f \uc720\ud074\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc815\ubcf4 \ucd9c\ucc98\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 GNN-TF\ub294 \uc885\ub2e8\uc801 \uc601\uc0c1 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \uce21\uba74\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uae30\uc874 \uba38\uc2e0 \ub7ec\ub2dd \ubc0f \ub525 \ub7ec\ub2dd \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc\uc758 \ube44\uad50 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 GNN-TF\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc744 \ub2a5\uac00\ud558\uba70 \ubbf8\ub798\uc758 \ud761\uc5f0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc548\ub41c GNN-TF \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc5d4\ub4dc \ud22c \uc5d4\ub4dc, \uc2dc\uac04 \uc778\uc2dd \ubcc0\ud658\uae30 \uc735\ud569 \uad6c\uc870\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\ub97c \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uace0 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \ub3d9\ud5a5\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc784\uc0c1 \uacb0\uacfc \uc608\uce21\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd98 \uae30\ub2a5\uc801 \ub1cc \uc601\uc0c1 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uadc0\uc911\ud55c \ubd84\uc11d \ub3c4\uad6c\ub85c \ub9cc\ub4ed\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Existing approaches sit at two extremes: conventional web frameworks provide reliable but fixed contexts backed by databases, while fully generative world models aim for unlimited environments at the expense of controllability and practical engineering. In this work, we introduce the Web World Model (WWM), a middle ground where world state and ``physics'' are implemented in ordinary web code to ensure logical consistency, while large language models generate context, narratives, and high-level decisions on top of this structured latent state. We build a suite of WWMs on a realistic web stack, including an infinite travel atlas grounded in real geography, fictional galaxy explorers, web-scale encyclopedic and narrative worlds, and simulation- and game-like environments. Across these systems, we identify practical design principles for WWMs: separating code-defined rules from model-driven imagination, representing latent state as typed web interfaces, and utilizing deterministic generation to achieve unlimited but structured exploration. Our results suggest that web stacks themselves can serve as a scalable substrate for world models, enabling controllable yet open-ended environments.

Even in tasks with abundant strong signals, the key to improving model performance often lies in effectively extracting weak signals. However, the lack of dedicated datasets has long constrained research. To address this, we construct the first specialized dataset for weak signal feature learning, containing 13,158 spectral samples. It features low SNR dominance (over 55% samples with SNR below 50) and extreme class imbalance (class ratio up to 29:1), providing a challenging benchmark for classification and regression in weak signal scenarios. We also propose a dual-view representation (vector + time-frequency map) and a PDVFN model tailored to low SNR, distribution skew, and dual imbalance. PDVFN extracts local sequential features and global frequency-domain structures in parallel, following principles of local enhancement, sequential modeling, noise suppression, multi-scale capture, frequency extraction, and global perception. This multi-source complementarity enhances representation for low-SNR and imbalanced data, offering a novel solution for WSL tasks like astronomical spectroscopy. Experiments show our method achieves higher accuracy and robustness in handling weak signals, high noise, and extreme class imbalance, especially in low SNR and imbalanced scenarios.

The standard algorithm, Online Newton Step (ONS), balances statistical optimality and computational practicality, guaranteeing an optimal regret of $O(d \\log T)$, where $d$ is the dimension and $T$ is the time horizon. ONS faces a computational bottleneck due to the Mahalanobis projections at each round. This step costs $\u03a9(d^\u03c9)$ arithmetic operations for bounded domains, even for the unit ball, where $\u03c9\\in (2,3]$ is the matrix-multiplication exponent. As a result, the total runtime can reach $\\tilde{O}(d^\u03c9T)$, particularly when iterates frequently oscillate near the domain boundary. For Stochastic eXp-concave Optimization (SXO), computational cost is also a challenge. Deploying ONS with online-to-batch conversion for SXO requires $T = \\tilde{O}(d/\u03b5)$ rounds to achieve an excess risk of $\u03b5$, and thereby necessitates an $\\tilde{O}(d^{\u03c9+1}/\u03b5)$ runtime. A COLT'13 open problem posed by Koren [2013] asks for an SXO algorithm with runtime less than $\\tilde{O}(d^{\u03c9+1}/\u03b5)$.\n  This paper proposes a simple variant of ONS, LightONS, which reduces the total runtime to $O(d^2 T + d^\u03c9\\sqrt{T \\log T})$ while preserving the optimal $O(d \\log T)$ regret. LightONS implies an SXO method with runtime $\\tilde{O}(d^3/\u03b5)$, thereby answering the open problem. Importantly, LightONS preserves the elegant structure of ONS by leveraging domain-conversion techniques from parameter-free online learning to introduce a hysteresis mechanism that delays expensive Mahalanobis projections until necessary. This design enables LightONS to serve as an efficient plug-in replacement of ONS in broader scenarios, even beyond regret minimization, including gradient-norm adaptive regret, parametric stochastic bandits, and memory-efficient online learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 ONS\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 LightONS\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubcc0\uc885\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec SXO \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c OXO \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uacfc ONS \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud568\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "LightONS\ub77c\ub294 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \ucd1d \ub7f0\ud0c0\uc784\uc744 $O(d^2 T + d^\u03c9\text{sqrt}{T \text{log} T})$\ub85c \uc904\uc774\uace0, ONS\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801 \uc190\ud574\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "LightONS\ub294 SXO \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \ub7f0\ud0c0\uc784\uc744 $\tilde{O}(d^3/\u03b5)$\ub85c \uc904\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "LightONS\ub294 ONS \ub300\uc2e0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ub300\uc548\uc73c\ub85c, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc628\ub77c\uc778 eXp-\uc624\ubaa9 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654(OXO)\ub294 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ubb38\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud45c\uc900 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc778 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ub274\ud134 \uc2a4\ud15d(ONS)\uc740 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \ucd5c\uc801\uc131\uacfc \uacc4\uc0b0\uc801 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc131\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4 $d$\uac00 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc774\uace0 $T$\uac00 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc218\ud3c9\uc120\uc778 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \ud6c4\ud68c\ub97c \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, graph data often exhibits overlap among different clients. Previous research has demonstrated certain benefits of overlapping data in mitigating data heterogeneity. However, the negative effects have not been explored, particularly in cases where the overlaps are imbalanced across clients. In this paper, we uncover the unfairness issue arising from imbalanced overlapping subgraphs through both empirical observations and theoretical reasoning. To address this issue, we propose FairGFL (FAIRness-aware subGraph Federated Learning), a novel algorithm that enhances cross-client fairness while maintaining model utility in a privacy-preserving manner. Specifically, FairGFL incorporates an interpretable weighted aggregation approach to enhance fairness across clients, leveraging privacy-preserving estimation of their overlapping ratios. Furthermore, FairGFL improves the tradeoff between model utility and fairness by integrating a carefully crafted regularizer into the federated composite loss function. Through extensive experiments on four benchmark graph datasets, we demonstrate that FairGFL outperforms four representative baseline algorithms in terms of both model utility and fairness.", "AI": {"tldr": "FairGFL\uc740 \ubd88\uade0\ud615 \uacb9\uce68 \uc11c\ube0c\uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uc5ec, \ud06c\ub85c\uc2a4 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uace0 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc720\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uacf5\uc815\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud558\uc5ec.", "method": "FairGFL \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \uacb9\uce68 \ube44\uc728\uc744 \ucd94\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uace0, \uc5f0\ud569 \ud569\uc131 \uc190\uc2e4 \ud568\uc218\uc5d0 \uc138\uc2ec\ud558\uac8c \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc815\uaddc\ud654\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "FairGFL\uc740 \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c Model utility\uc640 fairness \uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub300\ud45c \uae30\uc900 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ubd88\uade0\ud615 \uacb9\uce58\ub294 \uc11c\ube0c\uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uacf5\uc815\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \ud655\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \uc6d0\uc2dc \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ubd84\uc0b0\ub41c \uc11c\ube0c\uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc5d0\uc11c \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uacf5\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud574\uc900\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub294 \uc885\uc885 \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uac04\uc5d0 \uc911\ucca9\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\uc804 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\ucca9 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc774\uc810\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc73c\ub098, \uc911\ucca9\uc774 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uac04\uc5d0 \ubd88\uade0\ud615\ud560 \ub54c\uc758 \ubd80\uc815\uc801 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub294 \ud0d0\uad6c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc2e4\uc99d\uc801\uc778 \uad00\ucc30\uacfc \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubd88\uade0\ud615 \uc911\ucca9 \uc11c\ube0c\uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \ubd88\uacf5\uc815\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ubc1d\ud600\ub0b8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 FairGFL(\uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud55c \uc11c\ube0c\uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5)\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc720\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uac04 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4. \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c FairGFL\uc740 \uacb9\uce68 \ube44\uc728\uc758 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc \ubcf4\ud638 \ucd94\uc815\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\ub294 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uac00\uc911 \uc9d1\uacc4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c FairGFL\uc740 \uc138\uc2ec\ud558\uac8c \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc815\uaddc\uc790\ub97c \uc5f0\ud569 \ubcf5\ud569 \uc190\uc2e4 \ud568\uc218\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378 \uc720\uc6a9\uc131\uacfc \uacf5\uc815\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0\uc758 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 FairGFL\uc774 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc720\uc6a9\uc131\uacfc \uacf5\uc815\uc131 \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub300\ud45c \uae30\uc900 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc784\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

A key limitation of many model architectures is the implicit entanglement of morphological waveform patterns and rhythm dynamics, which can promote shortcut learning and amplify sensitivity to distribution shifts. We propose ECG-RAMBA, a framework that separates morphology and rhythm and then re-integrates them through context-aware fusion. ECG-RAMBA combines: (i) deterministic morphological features extracted by MiniRocket, (ii) global rhythm descriptors computed from heart-rate variability (HRV), and (iii) long-range contextual modeling via a bi-directional Mamba backbone. To improve sensitivity to transient abnormalities under windowed inference, we introduce a numerically stable Power Mean pooling operator ($Q=3$) that emphasizes high-evidence segments while avoiding the brittleness of max pooling and the dilution of averaging. We evaluate under a protocol-faithful setting with subject-level cross-validation, a fixed decision threshold, and no test-time adaptation. On the Chapman--Shaoxing dataset, ECG-RAMBA achieves a macro ROC-AUC $\\approx 0.85$.

While these CoT modes enhance reasoning capabilities, their generation of extended reasoning traces introduces substantial memory and latency overheads, posing challenges for practical deployment on Ascend NPUs. This paper addresses these computational constraints by leveraging low-bit quantization, which transforms FP16 computations into more efficient integer arithmetic. We introduce a unified low-bit inference framework, supporting INT8 (W8A8) and W4A8 quantization, specifically optimized for openPangu-Embedded models on the Atlas A2. Our comprehensive evaluation, conducted across all three CoT modes on code generation benchmarks (HumanEval and MBPP), demonstrates the efficacy of this approach. INT8 quantization consistently preserves over 90\\% of the FP16 baseline accuracy and achieves a 1.5x prefill speedup on the Atlas A2. Furthermore, W4A8 quantization significantly reduces memory consumption, albeit with a moderate trade-off in accuracy. These findings collectively indicate that low-bit quantization effectively facilitates efficient CoT reasoning on Ascend NPUs, maintaining high model fidelity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 openPangu-Embedded \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 Chain-of-Thought(CoT) \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0\uc11c \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ubc0f \uc9c0\uc5f0 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc800\ube44\ud2b8 \uc591\uc790\ud654\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ucd94\ub860 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "openPangu \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 CoT \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub4dc\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc600\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub192\uc740 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\uc640 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "FP16 \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc744 \uc815\uc218 \uc0b0\uc220\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub294 \uc800\ube44\ud2b8 \uc591\uc790\ud654\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569 \uc800\ube44\ud2b8 \ucd94\ub860 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 INT8(W8A8) \ubc0f W4A8 \uc591\uc790\ud654\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uace0 Atlas A2\uc5d0 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\ub294 \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 INT8 \uc591\uc790\ud654\uac00 FP16 \uae30\uc900 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c 90% \uc774\uc0c1 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 Atlas A2\uc5d0\uc11c 1.5\ubc30\uc758 \uc18d\ub3c4 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc800\ube44\ud2b8 \uc591\uc790\ud654\ub294 Ascend NPU\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 CoT \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \ub192\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378 \ucda9\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud568\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "Huawei\uc758 openPangu-Embedded-1B \ubc0f openPangu-Embedded-7B\ub294 openPangu \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ubcc0\ud615\uc73c\ub85c, \ub290\ub9ac\uac8c \uc0dd\uac01\ud558\uae30(slow_think), \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uac01\ud558\uae30(auto_think), \uc0dd\uac01\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uae30(no_think)\ub77c\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub69c\ub837\ud55c Chain-of-Thought (CoT) \ucd94\ub860 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c CoT \ubaa8\ub4dc\ub294 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc5f0\uc7a5\ub41c \ucd94\ub860 \ucd94\uc801\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ubc0f \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c \ubc1c\uc0dd\uc2dc\ucf1c Ascend NPU\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \ubc30\uce58\uc5d0 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uc81c\uae30\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 FP16 \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc744 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc815\uc218 \uc0b0\uc220\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub294 \uc800\ube44\ud2b8 \uc591\uc790\ud654\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc81c\uc57d \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Atlas A2\uc5d0\uc11c openPangu-Embedded \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ud2b9\ubcc4\ud788 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub41c INT8(W8A8) \ubc0f W4A8 \uc591\uc790\ud654\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569 \uc800\ube44\ud2b8 \ucd94\ub860 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c(HumanEval \ubc0f MBPP)\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 CoT \ubaa8\ub4dc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc218\ud589\ub41c \uc885\ud569 \ud3c9\uac00\ub294 \uc774 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \ud6a8\ub2a5\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, conventional velocity model building methods are often computationally expensive and time consuming. In recent years, with the rapid advancement of deep learning, particularly the success of generative models and neural operators, deep learning based approaches that integrate data and their statistics have attracted increasing attention in addressing the limitations of traditional methods. In this study, we propose a novel framework that combines generative models with neural operators to obtain high resolution velocity models efficiently. Within this workflow, the neural operator functions as a forward mapping operator to rapidly generate time lag reverse time migration (RTM) extended images from the true and migration velocity models. In this framework, the neural operator is acting as a surrogate for modeling followed by migration, which uses the true and migration velocities, respectively. The trained neural operator is then employed, through automatic differentiation, to gradually update the migration velocity placed in the true velocity input channel with high resolution components so that the output of the network matches the time lag images of observed data obtained using the migration velocity. By embedding a generative model, trained on a high-resolution velocity model distribution, which corresponds to the true velocity model distribution used to train the neural operator, as a regularizer, the resulting predictions are cleaner with higher resolution information. Both synthetic and field data experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed generative neural operator based velocity model building approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub525 \ub7ec\ub2dd

In this context, methods developed for the non-blind case cannot be adapted in a straightforward manner. Recently, data-driven approaches have been proposed to address blind inverse problems, demonstrating strong empirical performance and adaptability. However, these methods often lack interpretability and are not supported by rigorous theoretical guarantees, limiting their reliability in applied domains such as imaging inverse problems. In this work, we shed light on learning in blind inverse problems within the simplified yet insightful framework of Linear Minimum Mean Square Estimators (LMMSEs). We provide an in-depth theoretical analysis, deriving closed-form expressions for optimal estimators and extending classical results. In particular, we establish equivalences with suitably chosen Tikhonov-regularized formulations, where the regularization depends explicitly on the distributions of the unknown signal, the noise, and the random forward operators. We also prove convergence results under appropriate source condition assumptions. Furthermore, we derive rigorous finite-sample error bounds that characterize the performance of learned estimators as a function of the noise level, problem conditioning, and number of available samples. These bounds explicitly quantify the impact of operator randomness and reveal the associated convergence rates as this randomness vanishes. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings through illustrative numerical experiments that confirm the predicted convergence behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740

The dominant paradigm--Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA)--enforces feature invariance, aligning source and target representations via symmetric divergence minimization [Ganin et al., 2016]. We demonstrate that this approach is fundamentally flawed: when domains are unequally informative (e.g., high-quality vs degraded sensors), strict invariance necessitates information destruction, causing \"negative transfer\" that can be catastrophic in safety-critical applications [Wang et al., 2019].\n  We propose a decision-theoretic framework grounded in Le Cam's theory of statistical experiments [Le Cam, 1986], using constructive approximations to replace symmetric invariance with directional simulability. We introduce Le Cam Distortion, quantified by the Deficiency Distance $\u03b4(E_1, E_2)$, as a rigorous upper bound for transfer risk conditional on simulability. Our framework enables transfer without source degradation by learning a kernel that simulates the target from the source. Across five experiments (genomics, vision, reinforcement learning), Le Cam Distortion achieves: (1) near-perfect frequency estimation in HLA genomics (correlation $r=0.999$, matching classical methods), (2) zero source utility loss in CIFAR-10 image classification (81.2% accuracy preserved vs 34.7% drop for CycleGAN), and (3) safe policy transfer in RL control where invariance-based methods suffer catastrophic collapse. Le Cam Distortion provides the first principled framework for risk-controlled transfer learning in domains where negative transfer is unacceptable: medical imaging, autonomous systems, and precision medicine.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ube44\ub300\uce6d \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc804\uc1a1 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574

Existing systems often rely on a single agent to handle the entire workflow-interpreting issues, navigating large codebases, and implementing fixes-within one reasoning chain. Such monolithic designs force the model to retain irrelevant context, leading to spurious correlations and poor generalization. Motivated by how human engineers decompose complex problems, we propose structuring SWE agents as orchestrators coordinating specialized sub-agents for sub-tasks such as localization, editing, and validation. The challenge lies in discovering effective hierarchies automatically: as the number of sub-agents grows, the search space becomes combinatorial, and it is difficult to attribute credit to individual sub-agents within a team. We address these challenges by formulating hierarchy discovery as a multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem, where each arm represents a candidate sub-agent and the reward measures its helpfulness when collaborating with others. This framework, termed Bandit Optimization for Agent Design (BOAD), enables efficient exploration of sub-agent designs under limited evaluation budgets. On SWE-bench-Verified, BOAD outperforms single-agent and manually designed multi-agent systems. On SWE-bench-Live, featuring more recent and out-of-distribution issues, our 36B system ranks second on the leaderboard at the time of evaluation, surpassing larger models such as GPT-4 and Claude. These results demonstrate that automatically discovered hierarchical multi-agent systems significantly improve generalization on challenging long-horizon SWE tasks.
