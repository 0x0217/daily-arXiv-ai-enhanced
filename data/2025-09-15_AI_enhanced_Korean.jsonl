In this paper,\nwe present Meta-RL-Crypto, a unified transformer-based architecture that\nunifies meta-learning and reinforcement learning (RL) to create a fully\nself-improving trading agent. Starting from a vanilla instruction-tuned LLM,\nthe agent iteratively alternates between three roles-actor, judge, and\nmeta-judge-in a closed-loop architecture. This learning process requires no\nadditional human supervision. It can leverage multimodal market inputs and\ninternal preference feedback. The agent in the system continuously refines both\nthe trading policy and evaluation criteria.

We explore an\nalternative view: use LLMs to write code that leverages decades of numerical\nalgorithms. This shifts the burden from learning a solution function to making\ndomain-aware numerical choices. We ask whether LLMs can act as SciML agents\nthat, given a natural-language ODE description, generate runnable code that is\nscientifically appropriate, selecting suitable solvers (stiff vs. non-stiff),\nand enforcing stability checks. There is currently no benchmark to measure this\nkind of capability for scientific computing tasks. As such, we first introduce\ntwo new datasets: a diagnostic dataset of adversarial \"misleading\" problems;\nand a large-scale benchmark of 1,000 diverse ODE tasks. The diagnostic set\ncontains problems whose superficial appearance suggests stiffness, and that\nrequire algebraic simplification to demonstrate non-stiffness; and the\nlarge-scale benchmark spans stiff and non-stiff ODE regimes. We evaluate open-\nand closed-source LLM models along two axes: (i) unguided versus guided\nprompting with domain-specific knowledge; and (ii) off-the-shelf versus\nfine-tuned variants. Our evaluation measures both executability and numerical\nvalidity against reference solutions.

Its rapid development has been\ndriven by progress in deep learning, especially large language models (LLMs).\nMore recently, the term has expanded beyond mathematics to describe the broader\ntask of translating informal input into formal logical representations. At the\nsame time, a growing body of research explores using LLMs to translate informal\nlanguage into formal representations for reasoning, planning, and knowledge\nrepresentation - often without explicitly referring to this process as\nautoformalization.

The goal of this paper is to review - explicit or implicit\n- instances of what can be considered autoformalization and to propose a\nunified framework, encouraging cross-pollination between different fields to\nadvance the development of next generation AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc790\ub3d9 \ud615\uc2dd\ud654\uc758 \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \uac80\ud1a0\ud558\uace0, \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \uc5f0\uad6c \ubd84\uc57c \uac04\uc758 \ud611\ub825\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e4\uc74c \uc138\ub300 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc790\ub3d9 \ud615\uc2dd\ud654\ub294 \uc218\ud559\uc758 \ud615\uc2dd\ud654\ub97c \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uacfc\uc815\uc73c\ub85c\uc11c, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \ube44\uacf5\uc2dd \uc5b8\uc5b4\ub97c \ud615\uc2dd\uc801 \ud45c\ud604\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub294 \uae30\uc220\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc790\ub3d9 \ud615\uc2dd\ud654\ub97c \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub610\ub294 \uac04\uc811\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uace0\ub824\ud55c \uc0ac\ub840\ub4e4\uc744 \uac80\ud1a0\ud558\uace0, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubd84\uc57c \uac04\uc758 \ud611\ub825\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc790\ub3d9 \ud615\uc2dd\ud654\uc758 \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uace0, LLM\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud615\uc2dd\uc801 \ud45c\ud604\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \ubc88\uc5ed\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc870\ub9dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc790\ub3d9 \ud615\uc2dd\ud654\ub77c\ub294 \uac1c\ub150\uc740 \uc218\ud559\uc744 \ub118\uc5b4\uc11c \ub354 \ub113\uc740 \uc758\ubbf8\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ud5a5\ud6c4 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c \uac04\uc758 \ud611\ub825\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud568\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc790\ub3d9 \ud615\uc2dd\ud654\ub294 \ub300\ud654\ud615 \uc815\ub9ac \uc99d\uba85\uae30(\uc99d\uba85 \ubcf4\uc870 \ub3c4\uad6c)\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc218\ud559\uc744 \ud615\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uc758\ubbf8\ud558\ub294 \uc6a9\uc5b4\ub85c \ub4f1\uc7a5\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8 \ube60\ub978 \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \uc2ec\uce35 \ud559\uc2b5, \ud2b9\ud788 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ucd09\uc9c4\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc\uc5d0\ub294 \ube44\uacf5\uc2dd \uc785\ub825\uc744 \ud615\uc2dd\uc801 \ub17c\ub9ac \ud45c\ud604\uc73c\ub85c \ubc88\uc5ed\ud558\ub294 \ub354 \ub113\uc740 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc774 \uc6a9\uc5b4\uac00 \uc218\ud559\uc744 \ub118\uc5b4 \ud655\uc7a5\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0, LLM\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ube44\uacf5\uc2dd \uc5b8\uc5b4\ub97c \ud615\uc2dd\uc801 \ud45c\ud604\uc73c\ub85c \ubc88\uc5ed\ud558\ub294 \uc5f0\uad6c\uac00 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc885\uc885 \uc774 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9 \ud615\uc2dd\ud654\ub77c\uace0 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5b8\uae09\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \ube44\uc2b7\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8e8\uace0 \uc788\uc74c\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c \ubd84\uc57c\uc758 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \uc9c4\uc804\uc744 \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uacf5\uc720 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860, \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ubc0f \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uae30\ud68c\ub97c \uc81c\ud55c\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc758 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9 \ud615\uc2dd\ud654\ub85c \uac04\uc8fc\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc0ac\ub840\ub4e4\uc744 \uac80\ud1a0\ud558\uace0, \ub2e4\uc74c \uc138\ub300 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubd84\uc57c \uac04\uc758 \uad50\ub958\ub97c \uc7a5\ub824\ud558\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

This paper introduces a novel\nFederated Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (Fed-MARL) framework that\nincorporates cross-layer orchestration of both the MAC layer and application\nlayer for energy-efficient, privacy-preserving, and real-time resource\nmanagement across heterogeneous edge devices. Each agent uses a Deep Recurrent\nQ-Network (DRQN) to learn decentralized policies for task offloading, spectrum\naccess, and CPU energy adaptation based on local observations (e.g., queue\nlength, energy, CPU usage, and mobility). To protect privacy, we introduce a\nsecure aggregation protocol based on elliptic curve Diffie Hellman key\nexchange, which ensures accurate model updates without exposing raw data to\nsemi-honest adversaries. We formulate the resource management problem as a\npartially observable multi-agent Markov decision process (POMMDP) with a\nmulti-objective reward function that jointly optimizes latency, energy\nefficiency, spectral efficiency, fairness, and reliability under 6G-specific\nservice requirements such as URLLC, eMBB, and mMTC.

However, their application in\nlivestock farming remains limited, being constrained by several factors not\nleast the availability, diversity and complexity of knowledge sources. This\nstudy introduces an intelligent knowledge assistant system designed to support\nhealth management in farmed goats. Leveraging the Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration (RAG), two structured knowledge processing methods, table\ntextualization and decision-tree textualization, were proposed to enhance large\nlanguage models' (LLMs) understanding of heterogeneous data formats. Based on\nthese methods, a domain-specific goat farming knowledge base was established to\nimprove LLM's capacity for cross-scenario generalization. The knowledge base\nspans five key domains: Disease Prevention and Treatment, Nutrition Management,\nRearing Management, Goat Milk Management, and Basic Farming Knowledge.\nAdditionally, an online search module is integrated to enable real-time\nretrieval of up-to-date information. To evaluate system performance, six\nablation experiments were conducted to examine the contribution of each\ncomponent. The results demonstrated that heterogeneous knowledge fusion method\nachieved the best results, with mean accuracies of 87.90% on the validation set\nand 84.22% on the test set. Across the text-based, table-based, decision-tree\nbased Q&A tasks, accuracy consistently exceeded 85%, validating the\neffectiveness of structured knowledge fusion within a modular design. Error\nanalysis identified omission as the predominant error category, highlighting\nopportunities to further improve retrieval coverage and context integration. In\nconclusion, the results highlight the robustness and reliability of the\nproposed system for practical applications in goat farming.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294

Conventional risk analysis frameworks often reduce\ncomplexity to ensure manageability, creating silos that hinder comprehensive\nsolutions. A fundamental shift towards holistic strategies is essential to\nenable effective negotiations between different sectors and to balance the\ncompeting interests of stakeholders. However, achieving this balance is often\nhindered by limited time, vast amounts of information, and the complexity of\nintegrating diverse perspectives. This study presents an AI-assisted\nnegotiation framework that incorporates large language models (LLMs) and\nAI-based autonomous agents into a negotiation-centered risk analysis workflow.\nThe framework enables stakeholders to simulate negotiations, systematically\nmodel dynamics, anticipate compromises, and evaluate solution impacts. By\nleveraging LLMs' semantic analysis capabilities we could mitigate information\noverload and augment decision-making process under time constraints.\nProof-of-concept implementations were conducted in two real-world scenarios:\n(i) prudent use of a biopesticide, and (ii) targeted wild animal population\ncontrol.

However, accurately predicting key thermophysical\nproperties remains challenging due to the vast chemical design space and the\nlimited availability of experimental data. In this study, we present a\ndata-driven transfer learning framework that leverages a neural recommender\nsystem (NRS) to enable reliable property prediction for ILs using sparse\nexperimental datasets. The approach involves a two-stage process: first,\npre-training NRS models on COSMO-RS-based simulated data at fixed temperature\nand pressure to learn property-specific structural embeddings for cations and\nanions; and second, fine-tuning simple feedforward neural networks using these\nembeddings with experimental data at varying temperatures and pressures. In\nthis work, five essential IL properties are considered: density, viscosity,\nsurface tension, heat capacity, and melting point. The framework supports both\nwithin-property and cross-property knowledge transfer. Notably, pre-trained\nmodels for density, viscosity, and heat capacity are used to fine-tune models\nfor all five target properties, achieving improved performance by a substantial\nmargin for four of them. The model exhibits robust extrapolation to previously\nunseen ILs.

But how far does that\nassistance go? Can a large language model based agent actually help someone\naccomplish their goal as an active participant? We test this question by\nengaging an LLM in UNO, a turn-based card game, asking it not to win but\ninstead help another player to do so. We built a tool that allows decoder-only\nLLMs to participate as agents within the RLCard game environment.

In practice, some of the robots\nexecuting the plan may get delayed, which can introduce collision risk.\nAlthough robust execution methods are used to ensure safety even in the\npresence of delays, the delays may still have a significant impact on the\nduration of the execution. At some point, the accumulated delays may become\nsignificant enough that instead of continuing with the execution of the\noriginal plan, even if it was optimal, there may now exist an alternate plan\nwhich will lead to a shorter execution. However, the problem is how to decide\nwhen to search for the alternate plan, since it is a costly procedure. In this\npaper, we propose a holistic architecture for robust execution of MAPF plans,\nits monitoring and optimization. We exploit a robust execution method called\nAction Dependency Graph to maintain an estimate of the expected execution\nduration during the plan's execution. This estimate is used to predict the\npotential that finding an alternate plan would lead to shorter execution.

The twin is constructed with conditional neural Whitney forms\n(CNWF), coupling the numerical guarantees of finite element exterior calculus\n(FEEC) with transformer-based operator learning. The resulting model preserves\ndiscrete conservation, and adapts in real time to streaming sensor data. It\nemploys a conditional attention mechanism to identify: a reduced Whitney-form\nbasis; reduced integral balance equations; and a source field, each compatible\nwith given sensor measurements. The induced reduced-order environmental model\nretains the stability and consistency of standard finite-element simulation,\nyielding a physically realizable, regular mapping from sensor data to the\nsource field. We propose a staggered scheme that alternates between evaluating\nthe digital twin and applying Lloyd's algorithm to guide sensor placement, with\nanalysis providing conditions for monotone improvement of a coverage\nfunctional. Using the predicted source field as an importance function within\nan optimal-recovery scheme, we demonstrate recovery of point sources under\ncontinuity assumptions, highlighting the role of regularity as a sufficient\ncondition for localization. Experimental comparisons with physics-agnostic\ntransformer architectures show improved accuracy in complex geometries when\nphysical constraints are enforced, indicating that structure

However, it is\nunclear how this new capability would materialize and integrate in the real\nworld. To address this, we propose a conceptual framework where workflows\nevolve along two dimensions which are intelligence (from static to intelligent)\nand composition (from single to swarm) to chart an evolutionary path from\ncurrent workflow management systems to fully autonomous, distributed scientific\nlaboratories.

This setup enables SL to leverage server\ncomputation capacities without sharing data, making it highly effective in\nresource-constrained environments dealing with sensitive data. However, the\ndistributed nature enables malicious clients to manipulate the training\nprocess. By sending poisoned intermediate gradients, they can inject backdoors\ninto the shared DNN. Existing defenses are limited by often focusing on\nserver-side protection and introducing additional overhead for the server. A\nsignificant challenge for client-side defenses is enforcing malicious clients\nto correctly execute the defense algorithm.\n  We present ZORRO, a private, verifiable, and robust SL defense scheme.\nThrough our novel design and application of interactive zero-knowledge proofs\n(ZKPs), clients prove their correct execution of a client-located defense\nalgorithm, resulting in proofs of computational integrity attesting to the\nbenign nature of locally trained DNN portions. Leveraging the frequency\nrepresentation of model partitions enables ZORRO to conduct an in-depth\ninspection of the locally trained models in an untrusted environment, ensuring\nthat each client forwards a benign checkpoint to its succeeding client. In our\nextensive evaluation, covering different model architectures as well as various\nattack strategies and data scenarios, we show ZORRO's effectiveness, as it\nreduces the attack success rate to

We present an\ninformation-theoretic framework that reveals both the fundamental dynamics of\nRL and provides practical methods for diagnosing deployment-time anomalies.\nThrough analysis of state-action mutual information patterns in a robotic\ncontrol task, we first demonstrate that successful learning exhibits\ncharacteristic information signatures: mutual information between states and\nactions steadily increases from 0.84 to 2.83 bits (238% growth) despite growing\nstate entropy, indicating that agents develop increasingly selective attention\nto task-relevant patterns. Intriguingly, states, actions and next states joint\nmutual information, MI(S,A;S'), follows an inverted U-curve, peaking during\nearly learning before declining as the agent specializes suggesting a\ntransition from broad exploration to efficient exploitation. More immediately\nactionable, we show that information metrics can differentially diagnose system\nfailures: observation-space, i.e., states noise (sensor faults) produces broad\ncollapses across all information channels with pronounced drops in state-action\ncoupling, while action-space noise (actuator faults) selectively disrupts\naction-outcome predictability while preserving state-action relationships. This\ndifferential diagnostic capability demonstrated through controlled perturbation\nexperiments enables precise fault localization without architectural\nmodifications or performance degradation. By establishing information patterns\nas both signatures of learning and diagnostic for system health, we provide the\nfoundation for adaptive RL systems capable of autonomous fault detection and\npolicy adjustment based on information-theoretic principles.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ud604\uc2e4 \uc138\uacc4 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc30\uce58\ub41c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)

High-performance LLMs are often hosted on remote\nservers in public spaces. When tasks involve privacy data, MAS cannot securely\nutilize these LLMs without implementing privacy-preserving mechanisms. To\naddress this challenge, we propose a General Anonymizing Multi-Agent system\n(GAMA), which divides the agents' workspace into private and public spaces and\nprotects privacy through the anonymizing mechanism. In the private space,\nagents handle sensitive data, while in the public space, only anonymized data\nis utilized. GAMA incorporates two key modules to mitigate semantic loss caused\nby anonymization: Domain-Rule-based Knowledge Enhancement (DRKE) and\nDisproof-based Logic Enhancement (DLE). We evaluate GAMA on two public\nquestion-answering datasets: Trivia Creative Writing and Logic Grid Puzzle. The\nresults demonstrate that GAMA has superior performance compared to the\nstate-of-the-art models.

However, MAS still face challenges in effective\ntask planning when handling highly complex tasks with uncertainty, often\nresulting in misleading or incorrect outputs that hinder task execution. To\naddress this, we propose XAgents, a unified multi-agent cooperative framework\nbuilt on a multipolar task processing graph and IF-THEN rules. XAgents uses the\nmultipolar task processing graph to enable dynamic task planning and handle\ntask uncertainty. During subtask processing, it integrates domain-specific\nIF-THEN rules to constrain agent behaviors, while global rules enhance\ninter-agent collaboration. We evaluate the performance of XAgents across three\ndistinct datasets, demonstrating that it consistently surpasses\nstate-of-the-art single-agent and multi-agent approaches in both\nknowledge-typed and logic-typed question-answering tasks.

Sample-based\nmethods such as Sparse Sampling and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) are widely\nadopted for their ability to approximate optimal actions using a generative\nmodel. However, in practical settings, the generative model is often learned\nfrom limited data, introducing approximation errors that can degrade\nperformance or lead to unsafe behaviors. To address these challenges, Robust\nMDPs (RMDPs) offer a principled framework for planning under model uncertainty,\nyet existing approaches are typically computationally intensive and not suited\nfor real-time use. In this work, we introduce Robust Sparse Sampling (RSS), the\nfirst online planning algorithm for RMDPs with finite-sample theoretical\nperformance guarantees. Unlike Sparse Sampling, which estimates the nominal\nvalue function, RSS computes a robust value function by leveraging the\nefficiency and theoretical properties of Sample Average Approximation (SAA),\nenabling tractable robust policy computation in online settings.

Current\nmethods treat this as a pattern recognition task over long conversation logs,\nleading to critically low step-level accuracy (below 17\\%), which renders them\nimpractical for debugging complex systems. Their core weakness is a fundamental\ninability to perform robust counterfactual reasoning: to determine if\ncorrecting a single action would have actually averted the task failure. To\nbridge this counterfactual inference gap, we introduce Abduct-Act-Predict (A2P)\nScaffolding, a novel agent framework that transforms failure attribution from\npattern recognition into a structured causal inference task. A2P explicitly\nguides a large language model through a formal three-step reasoning process\nwithin a single inference pass: (1) Abduction, to infer the hidden root causes\nbehind an agent's actions; (2) Action, to define a minimal corrective\nintervention; and (3) Prediction, to simulate the subsequent trajectory and\nverify if the intervention resolves the failure. This structured approach\nleverages the holistic context of the entire conversation while imposing a\nrigorous causal logic on the model's analysis. Our extensive experiments on the\nWho\\&When benchmark demonstrate its efficacy.
