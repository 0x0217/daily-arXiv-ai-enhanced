However, many real-world problems\nrequire multiple agents to collaborate in order to achieve a common goal. For\nexample, a robot executing a task in a warehouse may require the assistance of\na drone to retrieve items from high shelves. In Decentralized Multi-Agent RL\n(DMARL), agents learn independently and then combine their policies at\nexecution time, but often must satisfy constraints on compatibility of local\npolicies to ensure that they can achieve the global task when combined. In this\npaper, we study how providing high-level symbolic knowledge to agents can help\naddress unique challenges of this setting, such as privacy constraints,\ncommunication limitations, and performance concerns. In particular, we extend\nthe formal tools used to check the compatibility of local policies with the\nteam task, making decentralized training with theoretical guarantees usable in\nmore scenarios. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that symbolic knowledge\nabout the temporal evolution of events in the environment can significantly\nexpedite the learning process in DMARL.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(DMARL)\uc5d0\uc11c \uace0\uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc0c1\uc9d5\uc801 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc774 \uacf5\ub3d9 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc774 \ub418\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uc218\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ud611\ub825\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c DMARL\uc758 \ub3c5\ud2b9\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574", "method": "\uace0\uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc0c1\uc9d5\uc801 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0\uac8c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0, \ud300 \uc791\uc5c5\uacfc\uc758 \ub85c\uceec \uc815\ucc45 \ud638\ud658\uc131\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud558\ub294 \uacf5\uc2dd \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \ud655\uc7a5\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uac16\ucd98 \ubd84\uc0b0 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc0c1\uc9d5\uc801 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc774 DMARL\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc785\uc99d.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc774 \uacf5\ub3d9 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc131\uacfc\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ub3d5\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0c1\uc9d5\uc801 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL) \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ucd5c\uc801 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ucc3e\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc218\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ud611\ub825\ud558\uc5ec \uacf5\ub3d9 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud574\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc608\ub97c \ub4e4\uc5b4, \ucc3d\uace0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ub85c\ubd07\uc740 \ub192\uc740 \uc120\ubc18\uc5d0\uc11c \ubb3c\ud488\uc744 \uac80\uc0c9\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub4dc\ub860\uc758 \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubd84\uc0b0 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 RL(DMARL)\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ud55c \ud6c4 \uc2e4\ud589 \uc2dc \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uacb0\ud569\ud560 \ub54c \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ub85c\uceec \uc815\ucc45\uc758 \ud638\ud658\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc81c\uc57d \uc870\uac74\uc744 \ub9cc\uc871\ud574\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0\uac8c \uace0\uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc0c1\uc9d5\uc801 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uac1c\uc778\uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \uc81c\uc57d, \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc81c\ud55c \ubc0f \uc131\ub2a5 \ubb38\uc81c\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc774 \uc124\uc815\uc758 \uace0\uc720\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc774 \ub418\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788, \ud300 \uc791\uc5c5\uacfc \ub85c\uceec \uc815\ucc45\uc758 \ud638\ud658\uc131\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud558\ub294 \uacf5\uc2dd \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uac16\ucd98 \ubd84\uc0b0 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub098\uc544\uac00 \ud658\uacbd \ub0b4 \uc0ac\uac74\uc758 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \uc9c4\ud654\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0c1\uc9d5\uc801 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc774 DMARL\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ud68d\uae30\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, existing agentic systems for\nscience suffer from two fundamental limitations: rigid, pre-programmed\nworkflows that cannot adapt to intermediate findings, and inadequate context\nmanagement that hinders long-horizon research. We present\n\\texttt{freephdlabor}, an open-source multiagent framework featuring\n\\textit{fully dynamic workflows} determined by real-time agent reasoning and a\n\\coloremph{\\textit{modular architecture}} enabling seamless customization --\nusers can modify, add, or remove agents to address domain-specific\nrequirements. The framework provides comprehensive infrastructure including\n\\textit{automatic context compaction}, \\textit{workspace-based communication}\nto prevent information degradation, \\textit{memory persistence} across\nsessions, and \\textit{non-blocking human intervention} mechanisms. These\nfeatures collectively transform automated research from isolated, single-run\nattempts into \\textit{continual research programs} that build systematically on\nprior explorations and incorporate human feedback. By providing both the\narchitectural principles and practical implementation for building customizable\nco-scientist systems, this work aims to facilitate broader adoption of\nautomated research

We present AURA (Agent\naUtonomy Risk Assessment), a unified framework designed to detect, quantify,\nand mitigate risks arising from agentic AI. Building on recent research and\npractical deployments, AURA introduces a gamma-based risk scoring methodology\nthat balances risk assessment accuracy with computational efficiency and\npractical considerations. AURA provides an interactive process to score,\nevaluate and mitigate the risks of running one or multiple AI Agents,\nsynchronously or asynchronously (autonomously). The framework is engineered for\nHuman-in-the-Loop (HITL) oversight and presents Agent-to-Human (A2H)\ncommunication mechanisms, allowing for seamless integration with agentic\nsystems for autonomous self-assessment, rendering it interoperable with\nestablished protocols (MCP and A2A) and tools. AURA supports a responsible and\ntransparent adoption of agentic AI and provides robust risk detection and\nmitigation while balancing computational resources, positioning it as a\ncritical enabler for large-scale, governable agentic AI in enterprise\nenvironments.", "AI": {"tldr": "AURA\ub294 \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc644\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5\uc758 \uaddc\ubaa8 \uc788\ub294 \ubc30\ud3ec\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc778 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ucc44\ud0dd\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \uc815\ub82c, \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4 \ubc0f \uc704\ud5d8 \uad00\ub9ac\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uc804\uc774 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ubc30\ud3ec\ub97c \ubc29\ud574\ud560 \uc704\ud5d8\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "AURA\ub294 \uac10\ub9c8 \uae30\ubc18 \uc704\ud5d8 \uc810\uc218 \ub9e4\uae30\uae30 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc704\ud5d8 \ud3c9\uac00\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uacfc \uacc4\uc0b0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \ubc0f \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \uade0\ud615 \uc788\uac8c \uc720\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "AURA\ub294 \ud558\ub098 \ub610\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ub610\ub294 \ube44\ub3d9\uae30\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b4\uc601\ud560 \ub54c\uc758 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc810\uc218\ud654, \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc0f \uc644\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc778\ud130\ub799\ud2f0\ube0c \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "AURA\ub294 \uc790\uc728 AI\uc758 \ucc45\uc784 \uc788\uace0 \ud22c\uba85\ud55c \ucc44\ud0dd\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uace0, \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc704\ud5d8 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ubc0f \uc644\ud654\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uacc4\uc0b0 \ub9ac\uc18c\uc2a4\ub97c \uade0\ud615 \uc788\uac8c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\uc5c5 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8, \uad00\ub9ac \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc790\uc728 AI\uc758 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ucd09\uc9c4\uc81c\ub85c \uc790\ub9ac \uc7a1\ub294\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uc870\uc9c1\uc5d0\uc11c \ucc44\ud0dd\ub428\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c alignment, governance \ubc0f risk management\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uc804\uc774 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ubc30\ud3ec\ub97c \ubc29\ud574\ud560 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 AURA (Agent autonomy Risk Assessment)\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\ub294\ub370, \uc774\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 AI\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ud0d0\uc9c0, \uc815\ub7c9\ud654 \ubc0f \uc644\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc \uc5f0\uad6c\uc640 \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ubc30\ud3ec\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c AURA\ub294 \uc704\ud5d8 \ud3c9\uac00\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uacfc \uacc4\uc0b0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \ubc0f \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uace0\ub824 \uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \uade0\ud615 \uc788\uac8c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uac10\ub9c8 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc704\ud5d8 \uc810\uc218 \ub9e4\uae30\uae30 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4.

This paper provides\na systematic empirical characterization of byte level statistics under\nintermittent encryption across common file types, establishing a comprehensive\nbaseline of how partial encryption impacts data structure. We specialize a\nclassical KL divergence upper bound on a tailored mixture model of intermittent\nencryption, yielding filetype specific detectability ceilings for\nhistogram-based detectors. Leveraging insights from this analysis, we\nempirically evaluate convolutional neural network (CNN) based detection methods\nusing realistic intermittent encryption configurations derived from leading\nransomware variants.

In this\nstudy, a novel method for procedural level design using Deep Reinforcement\nLearning (DRL) within a Unity-based 3D environment is proposed. The system\ncomprises two agents: a hummingbird agent, acting as a solver, and a floating\nisland agent, responsible for generating and placing collectible objects\n(flowers) on the terrain in a realistic and context-aware manner. The\nhummingbird is trained using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm\nfrom the Unity ML-Agents toolkit. It learns to navigate through the terrain\nefficiently, locate flowers, and collect them while adapting to the\never-changing procedural layout of the island. The island agent is also trained\nusing the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. It learns to generate\nflower layouts based on observed obstacle positions, the hummingbird's initial\nstate, and performance feedback from previous episodes. The interaction between\nthese agents leads to emergent behavior and robust generalization across\nvarious environmental configurations. The results demonstrate that the approach\nnot only produces effective and efficient agent behavior but also opens up new\nopportunities for autonomous game level design driven by machine learning. This\nwork highlights the potential of DRL in enabling intelligent agents to both\ngenerate and solve content in virtual environments, pushing the boundaries of\nwhat AI can contribute to creative game development processes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 Deep Reinforcement Learning(DRL)\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uc808\ucc28\uc801 \ub808\ubca8 \ub514\uc790\uc778\uc744

In contrast, Distributional Reinforcement Learning (DRL)\nestimates the entire probability distribution of possible rewards, providing\nricher information about uncertainty and variability. C51 is a popular DRL\nalgorithm for discrete action spaces. It uses a Q-learning approach, where the\ndistribution is learned using a greedy Bellman update. However, this can cause\nproblems if multiple actions at a state have similar expected reward but with\ndifferent distributions, as the algorithm may not learn a stable distribution.\nThis study presents a modified version of C51 (ES-C51) that replaces the greedy\nQ-learning update with an Expected Sarsa update, which uses a softmax\ncalculation to combine information from all possible actions at a state rather\nthan relying on a single best action. This reduces instability when actions\nhave similar expected rewards and allows the agent to learn higher-performing\npolicies. This approach is evaluated on classic control environments from Gym,\nand Atari-10 games. For a fair comparison, we modify the standard C51's\nexploration strategy from e-greedy to softmax, which we refer to as QL-C51 (Q-\nLearning based C51). The results demonstrate that ES-C51 outperforms QL-C51\nacross many environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "ES-C51\uc740 C51 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc218\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \uc548\uc815\uc131\uacfc \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 C51\uc774 \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \ud589\ub3d9\ub4e4\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd88\uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "C51 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 e-\ud0d0\uc695\uc5d0\uc11c \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\ub9e5\uc2a4 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\uacbd\ud558\uace0, \uadf8\ub9ac\ub514 Q-\ud559\uc2b5 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \uae30\ub300 Sarsa \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub85c \ub300\uccb4\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uac00\ub2a5 \ud589\ub3d9\uc758 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "ES-C51\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c QL-C51\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "ES-C51\uc740 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc758 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0 \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub0b8\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \uac00\uce58 \uae30\ubc18 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL) \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uac01 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc608\uc0c1 \ubcf4\uc0c1\ub9cc\uc744 \ucd94\uc815\ud558\uace0 \uac00\uc7a5 \ub192\uc740 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc120\ud0dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubc18\uba74, \ubd84\ud3ec\uc801 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(DRL)\uc740 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc758 \ud655\ub960 \ubd84\ud3ec \uc804\uccb4\ub97c \ucd94\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uacfc \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub354 \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Existing privacy benchmarks only focus on simplistic, single-turn\ninteractions where private information can be trivially omitted without\naffecting task outcomes. In this paper, we introduce MAGPIE (Multi-AGent\ncontextual PrIvacy Evaluation), a novel benchmark of 200 high-stakes tasks\ndesigned to evaluate privacy understanding and preservation in multi-agent\ncollaborative, non-adversarial scenarios. MAGPIE integrates private information\nas essential for task resolution, forcing agents to balance effective\ncollaboration with strategic information control. Our evaluation reveals that\nstate-of-the-art agents, including GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5-Pro, exhibit\nsignificant privacy leakage, with Gemini 2.5-Pro leaking up to 50.7% and GPT-5\nup to 35.1% of the sensitive information even when explicitly instructed not\nto. Moreover, these agents struggle to achieve consensus or task completion and\noften resort to undesirable behaviors such as manipulation and power-seeking\n(e.g., Gemini 2.5-Pro demonstrating manipulation in 38.2% of the cases).

We begin by laying foundations,\ndefinitions of knowledge, learning, intelligence, counterfactual competence and\nAGI, and then analyze the limits of observational learning that motivate an\nerror centric shift. We recast the problem as three questions about how\nexplicit and implicit errors evolve under an agent's actions, which errors are\nunreachable within a fixed hypothesis space, and how conjecture and criticism\nexpand that space. From these questions we propose Causal Mechanics, a\nmechanisms first program in which hypothesis space change is a first class\noperation and probabilistic structure is used when useful rather than presumed.\nWe advance structural principles that make error discovery and correction\ntractable, including a differential Locality and Autonomy Principle for modular\ninterventions, a gauge invariant form of Independent Causal Mechanisms for\nseparability, and the Compositional Autonomy Principle for analogy\npreservation, together with actionable diagnostics.

Real-world environments are complex and dynamic, governed by\ntask-specific rules and stochasticity, which makes it difficult for LLMs to\nground their internal knowledge in those dynamics. Under such OOD conditions,\nvanilla RL training often fails to scale; we observe Pass@k--the probability\nthat at least one of (k) sampled trajectories succeeds--drops markedly across\ntraining steps, indicating brittle exploration and limited generalization.\nInspired by model-based reinforcement learning, we hypothesize that equipping\nLLM agents with an internal world model can better align reasoning with\nenvironmental dynamics and improve decision-making. We show how to encode this\nworld model by decomposing it into two components: state representation and\ntransition modeling. Building on this, we introduce SPA, a simple reinforcement\nlearning framework that cold-starts the policy via a Self-Play supervised\nfinetuning (SFT) stage to learn the world model by interacting with the\nenvironment, then uses it to simulate future states prior to policy\noptimization. This simple initialization outperforms the online world-modeling\nbaseline and greatly boosts the RL-based agent training performance.\nExperiments across diverse environments like Sokoban, FrozenLake, and Sudoku\nshow that our approach significantly improves performance. For example, SPA\nboosts the Sokoban success rate from 25.6% to 59.8% and raises the FrozenLake\nscore from 22.1% to 70.9% for the Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc774 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud558\uace0 \ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub0b4\ubd80 \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 RL \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM\uc774 OOD \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uc8fc \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uc74c\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \ud658\uacbd \ub3d9\ub825\ud559\uacfc\uc758 \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub824\ub294 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc0dd\uacbc\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub0b4\ubd80 \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc0c1\ud0dc \ud45c\ud604\uacfc \uc804\uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\uace0, \uc790\uae30 \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \uac10\ub3c5 \uc138\ubc00 \uc870\uc815 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub85c \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ucd08\uae30\ud654\ud55c \ud6c4 \ud658\uacbd\uacfc\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774 \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \ucd08\uae30\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \ub2a5\uac00\ud558\uace0 RL \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc720\uc758\ubbf8\ud558\uac8c \uac1c\uc120\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uc2e4\uc81c \uc608\uc2dc\ub294 Sokoban\uc758 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 25.6%\uc5d0\uc11c 59.8%\ub85c, FrozenLake \uc810\uc218\ub97c 22.1%\uc5d0\uc11c 70.9%\ub85c \uc0c1\uc2b9\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \ubd84\ud3ec \uc678(out-of-distribution, OOD) \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\uc81c \ud658\uacbd\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud558\uace0 \ub3d9\uc801\uc774\uba70, \uc791\uc5c5 \ud2b9\uc815 \uaddc\uce59\uacfc \ud655\ub960\uc131\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc9c0\ubc30\ub418\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 LLM\uc774 \ub0b4\ubd80 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc5ed\ud559\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\uc744 \ub450\uae30 \uc5b4\ub835\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4ed\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c OOD \uc870\uac74 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 RL \ud6c8\ub828\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \ud655\uc7a5\uc5d0 \uc2e4\ud328\ud558\uba70, (k) \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\ub41c \uada4\uc801 \uc911 \uc801\uc5b4\ub3c4 \ud558\ub098\uac00 \uc131\uacf5\ud560 \ud655\ub960\uc778 Pass@k\uac00 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \ud604\uc800\ud788 \uac10\uc18c\ud558\uc5ec \ucde8\uc57d\ud55c \ud0d0\uc0c9\uacfc \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc544, LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub0b4\ubd80 \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc7a5\ucc29\ud558\uba74 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud658\uacbd \ub3d9\ub825\ud559\uacfc \ub354 \uc798 \uc815\ub82c\ud558\uace0 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4\uace0 \uac00\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0c1\ud0dc \ud45c\ud604\uacfc \uc804\uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc758 \ub450 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\uc5ec \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 SPA\ub77c\ub294 \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc790\uae30 \uac8c\uc784(self-play) \uac10\ub3c5 \uc138\ubc00 \uc870\uc815(SFT) \ub2e8\uacc4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ucd08\uae30\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \ud658\uacbd\uacfc\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud55c \ub2e4\uc74c \uc774\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\ucc45 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc804\uc5d0 \ubbf8\ub798 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \ucd08\uae30\ud654\ub294 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\uace0 RL \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Provenance graphs model these logs as\nconnected entities and events, revealing relationships that are missed by\nlinear log representations. Existing systems apply anomaly detection to these\ngraphs but often suffer from high false positive rates and coarse-grained\nalerts. Their reliance on node attributes like file paths or IPs leads to\nspurious correlations, reducing detection robustness and reliability. To fully\nunderstand an attack's progression and impact, security analysts need systems\nthat can generate accurate, human-like narratives of the entire attack. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce OCR-APT, a system for APT detection and\nreconstruction of human-like attack stories. OCR-APT uses Graph Neural Networks\n(GNNs) for subgraph anomaly detection, learning behavior patterns around nodes\nrather than fragile attributes such as file paths or IPs. This approach leads\nto a more robust anomaly detection. It then iterates over detected subgraphs\nusing Large Language Models (LLMs) to reconstruct multi-stage attack stories.\nEach stage is validated before proceeding, reducing hallucinations and ensuring\nan interpretable final report.

While large language models now\napproximate human responses at scale, they remain tuned to population-level\nconsensus, often erasing the individuality of reasoning styles and belief\ntrajectories. To advance the vision of more human-like reasoning in machines,\nwe introduce HugAgent (Human-Grounded Agent Benchmark), a benchmark for\naverage-to-individual reasoning adaptation. The task is to predict how a\nspecific person would reason and update their beliefs in novel scenarios, given\npartial evidence of their past views. HugAgent adopts a dual-track design: a\nsynthetic track for scale and systematic stress tests, and a human track for\necologically valid, \"out-loud\" reasoning data. This design enables scalable,\nreproducible evaluation of intra-agent fidelity: whether models can capture not\njust what people believe, but how their reasoning evolves.

However, the architecture of these controllers introduces new\npotential attack surfaces that have thus far received inadequate attention. In\nresponse to these concerns, we introduce Ambusher, a testing tool designed to\ndiscover vulnerabilities within protocols used in distributed SDN controllers.\nAmbusher achieves this by leveraging protocol state fuzzing, which\nsystematically finds attack scenarios based on an inferred state machine. Since\nlearning states from a cluster is complicated, Ambusher proposes a novel\nmethodology that extracts a single and relatively simple state machine,\nachieving efficient state-based fuzzing. Our evaluation of Ambusher, conducted\non a real SD-WAN deployment spanning two campus networks and one enterprise\nnetwork, illustrates its ability to uncover 6 potential vulnerabilities in the\nwidely used distributed controller platform.", "AI": {"tldr": "Ambusher\ub294 \ubd84\uc0b0 SDN \ucee8\ud2b8\ub864\ub7ec\uc5d0\uc11c \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc758 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub85c, \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc0c1\ud0dc \uae30\ubc18 \ud37c\uc9d5\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec 6\uac00\uc9c0 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801\uc778 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \ubc1d\ud600\ub0b8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubd84\uc0b0 SDN \ucee8\ud2b8\ub864\ub7ec\uc758 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uac00 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacf5\uaca9 \ud45c\uba74\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "Ambusher\ub294 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c \uc0c1\ud0dc \ud37c\uc9d5\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ucd94\ub860\ub41c \uc0c1\ud0dc \uae30\uacc4\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uc5ec \uacf5\uaca9 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub97c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucc3e\uc544\ub0b8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \ub2e8\uc77c\ud558\uace0 \ube44\uad50\uc801 \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \uc0c1\ud0dc \uae30\uacc4\ub97c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "Ambusher\ub97c \uc2e4\uc81c SD-WAN \ubc30\ud3ec \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \ubd84\uc0b0 \ucee8\ud2b8\ub864\ub7ec \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc5d0\uc11c 6\uac1c\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801\uc778 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Ambusher\ub294 \ubd84\uc0b0 SDN \ucee8\ud2b8\ub864\ub7ec\uc5d0\uc11c \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc758 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub85c, \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ub370 \uae30\uc5ec\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubd84\uc0b0 SDN(\uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uc815\uc758 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud0b9) \ucee8\ud2b8\ub864\ub7ec\ub294 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uc778\ud504\ub77c\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \ube60\ub974\uac8c WAN(\uad11\uc5ed \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c)\uc758 \ud544\uc218 \uc694\uc18c\uac00 \ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \ud2b9\ud788 SD-WAN \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ucee8\ud2b8\ub864\ub7ec\uc758 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9 \ud45c\uba74\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ud604\uc7ac\uae4c\uc9c0 \ucda9\ubd84\ud55c \uc8fc\ubaa9\uc744 \ubc1b\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\uc751\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubd84\uc0b0 SDN \ucee8\ud2b8\ub864\ub7ec\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c \ub0b4\uc758 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc778 Ambusher\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.

We present a\nnovel dataset comprising 733,651 facial expression records from 38 employees\ncollected over 30.5 months (November 2021 to May 2024) in an authentic office\nenvironment. Each record contains seven emotion probabilities (neutral, happy,\nsad, surprised, fear, disgusted, angry) derived from deep learning-based facial\nexpression recognition, along with comprehensive metadata including job roles,\nemployment outcomes, and personality traits. The dataset uniquely spans the\nCOVID-19 pandemic period, capturing emotional responses to major societal\nevents including the Shanghai lockdown and policy changes. We provide 32\nextended emotional metrics computed using established affective science\nmethods, including valence, arousal, volatility, predictability, inertia, and\nemotional contagion strength. Technical validation demonstrates high data\nquality through successful replication of known psychological patterns (weekend\neffect: +192% valence improvement, p < 0.001; diurnal rhythm validated) and\nperfect predictive validity for employee turnover (AUC=1.0). Baseline\nexperiments using Random Forest and LSTM models achieve 91.2% accuracy for\nemotion classification and R2 = 0.84 for valence prediction.

TempO outperforms state-of-the-art\nbaselines across three benchmark PDE datasets, and spectral analysis further\ndemonstrates superior recovery of multi-scale dynamics, while efficiency\nstudies highlight its parameter- and memory-light design compared to\nattention-based or convolutional regressors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \ud3b8\ubbf8\ubd84\ubc29\uc815\uc2dd(PDE) \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc758 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc778 TempO\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 PDE \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc758 \uc608\uce21\uc740 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804\uacfc\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "TempO\ub294 \ud76c\uc18c \uc870\uac74\uacfc \ucc44\ub110 \uc811\uae30\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec 3D \uc2dc\uacf5\uac04 \ud544\ub4dc\ub97c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \uc7a0\uc7ac \ud750\ub984 \ub9e4\uce6d \ubaa8\ub378\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "TempO\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c PDE \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "TempO\ub294 \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uc8fc\uc758 \uae30\ubc18 \ub610\ub294 \ud569\uc131\uacf1 \ud68c\uadc0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub7c9\uc774 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uace0\ucc28\uc6d0, \ud3b8\ubbf8\ubd84 \ubc29\uc815\uc2dd(PDE)\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c0\ubc30\ub418\ub294 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc758 \uc608\uce21\uc740 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub85c \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc790\uac00 \ud68c\uadc0 \ubc0f \ud655\uc0b0 \uae30\ubc18 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \ub204\uc801 \uc624\ub958\uc640 \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc544\ud2f0\ud329\ud2b8\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uae34 \uc2dc\uac04 \ub3d9\uc548 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uc608\uce21\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud750\ub984 \uc77c\uce58\ub294 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uacb0\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7ec\uc6b4 \ub300\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 FNO \uadfc\uc0ac \uc624\ucc28\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0c1\ud55c\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud558\uace0, \uc2dc\uac04 \uc870\uac74\ubd80 \ud478\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uace0\ucda9\uc2e4\ub3c4\ub85c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c \ubaa8\ub4dc\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ucc44\ub110 \uc811\uae30\uc640 \ud76c\uc18c \uc870\uac74\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \ud750\ub984 \ub9e4\uce6d \ubaa8\ub378\uc778 TempO\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

This creates\ntwo problems: (i) equal weighting treats all domains as equally important when\nhuman intelligence research suggests otherwise, and (ii) snapshot testing can't\ndistinguish durable capabilities from brittle performances that collapse under\ndelay or stress. I argue that general intelligence -- in humans and potentially\nin machines -- is better understood as a homeostatic property cluster: a set of\nabilities plus the mechanisms that keep those abilities co-present under\nperturbation. On this view, AGI evaluation should weight domains by their\ncausal centrality (their contribution to cluster stability) and require\nevidence of persistence across sessions. I propose two battery-compatible\nextensions: a centrality-prior score that imports CHC-derived weights with\ntransparent sensitivity analysis, and a Cluster Stability Index family that\nseparates profile persistence, durable learning, and error correction.

Transfer learning (TL), widely\nsuccessful in large language models (LLMs), offers a promising direction for\nenhancing RL efficiency by leveraging pre-trained models.\n  This paper investigates policy transfer, a TL approach that initializes\nlearning in a target RL task using a policy from a related source task, in the\ncontext of continuous-time linear quadratic regulators (LQRs) with entropy\nregularization. We provide the first theoretical proof of policy transfer for\ncontinuous-time RL, proving that a policy optimal for one LQR serves as a\nnear-optimal initialization for closely related LQRs, while preserving the\noriginal algorithm's convergence rate. Furthermore, we introduce a novel policy\nlearning algorithm for continuous-time LQRs that achieves global linear and\nlocal super-linear convergence. Our results demonstrate both theoretical\nguarantees and algorithmic benefits of transfer learning in continuous-time RL,\naddressing a gap in existing literature and extending prior work from discrete\nto continuous time settings.\n  As a byproduct of our analysis, we derive the stability of a class of\ncontinuous-time score-based diffusion models via their connection with LQRs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc5f0\uc18d \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc815\ucc45 \uc804\uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec RL\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\ubbc0\ub85c, \uc815\ucc45 \uc804\uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\ub294 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc815\ucc45 \uc804\uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uad00\ub828 \uc18c\uc2a4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa9\ud45c RL \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ucd08\uae30\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc815\ucc45 \uc804\uc774\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc99d\uba85\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc815\ucc45 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc815\ucc45 \uc804\uc774\uac00 \uc5f0\uc18d \uc2dc\uac04 RL\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c \uac2d\uc744 \uba54\uc6b0\uace0, \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \uc804\uc774 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc774\uc810\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc740 \ub300\ub9ac\uc778\uc774 \ud658\uacbd\uacfc\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ucc98\uc74c\ubd80\ud130 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc5d0\uc11c \ub110\ub9ac \uc131\uacf5\uc744 \uac70\ub454 \uc804\uc774 \ud559\uc2b5(TL)\uc740 \ubbf8\ub9ac \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec RL \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \uc815\uaddc\ud654\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uc5f0\uc18d \uc2dc\uac04 \uc120\ud615 \uc774\ucc28 \uc870\uc808\uae30(LQR) \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0\uc11c \uad00\ub828 \uc18c\uc2a4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa9\ud45c RL \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ucd08\uae30\ud654\ud558\ub294 TL \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc778 \uc815\ucc45 \uc804\uc774\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud558\ub098\uc758 LQR\uc5d0 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub41c \uc815\ucc45\uc774 \ubc00\uc811\ud558\uac8c \uad00\ub828\ub41c LQR\uc758 \uadfc\uc0ac \ucd5c\uc801 \ucd08\uae30\ud654\ub85c \uc791\uc6a9\ud558\uba70 \uc6d0\ub798 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \uc218\ub834 \uc18d\ub3c4\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud558\uc5ec \uc5f0\uc18d \uc2dc\uac04 RL\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc815\ucc45 \uc804\uc774\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc99d\uba85\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uc120\ud615 \ubc0f \ub85c\uceec \ucd08\uc120\ud615 \uc218\ub834\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc5f0\uc18d \uc2dc\uac04 LQR\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc815\ucc45 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uacfc \uc5f0\uc18d \uc2dc\uac04 RL\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc804\uc774 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc801 \uc774\uc810\uc744 \ubaa8\ub450 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uae30\uc874 \ubb38\ud5cc\uc758 \uac2d\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0 \uc774\uc0b0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5f0\uc18d \uc2dc\uac04 \uc124\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\uc804 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud655\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubd84\uc11d\uc758 \ubd80\uc0b0\ubb3c\ub85c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 LQR\uacfc\uc758 \uc5f0\uacb0\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5f0\uc18d \uc2dc\uac04 \uc810\uc218 \uae30\ubc18 \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4\uc758 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

This is a preprint version of the\n  manuscript titled \"An Advanced Two-Stage Model with High Sensitivity and\n  Generalizability for Prediction of Hip Fracture Risk Using Multiple\n  Datasets.\" The paper is currently under journal submission", "summary": "Hip fractures are a major cause of disability, mortality, and healthcare\nburden in older adults, underscoring the need for early risk assessment.\nHowever, commonly used tools such as the DXA T-score and FRAX often lack\nsensitivity and miss individuals at high risk, particularly those without prior\nfractures or with osteopenia. To address this limitation, we propose a\nsequential two-stage model that integrates clinical and imaging information to\nimprove prediction accuracy. Using data from the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men\nStudy (MrOS), the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF), and the UK Biobank,\nStage 1 (Screening) employs clinical, demographic, and functional variables to\nestimate baseline risk, while Stage 2 (Imaging) incorporates DXA-derived\nfeatures for refinement. The model was rigorously validated through internal\nand external testing, showing consistent performance and adaptability across\ncohorts. Compared to T-score and FRAX, the two-stage framework achieved higher\nsensitivity and reduced missed cases, offering a cost-effective and\npersonalized approach for early hip fracture risk assessment.\n  Keywords: Hip Fracture, Two-Stage Model, Risk Prediction, Sensitivity, DXA,\nFRAX", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uace0\uad00\uc808 \uace8\uc808 \uc704\ud5d8 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc784\uc0c1 \ubc0f \uc774\ubbf8\uc9d5 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \ub450 \ub2e8\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uace0\uad00\uc808 \uace8\uc808\uc740 \ub178\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uc7a5\uc560, \uc0ac\ub9dd \ubc0f \uc758\ub8cc \ubd80\ub2f4\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc6d0\uc778\uc73c\ub85c, \uc870\uae30 \uc704\ud5d8 \ud3c9\uac00\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study (MrOS), Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF) \ubc0f UK Biobank\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud074\ub9ac\ub2c9, \uc778\uad6c\ud1b5\uacc4\ud559\uc801 \ubc0f \uae30\ub2a5\uc801 \ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud574 1\ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\ubcf8 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ucd94\uc815\ud558\uace0, 2\ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c DXA\uc5d0\uc11c \ud30c\uc0dd\ub41c \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uc5ec \uac1c\uc120\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ub0b4\ubd80 \ubc0f \uc678\ubd80 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud558\uac8c \uac80\uc99d\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc801\uc751\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "T-score \ubc0f FRAX\uc640 \ube44\uad50\ud588\uc744 \ub54c, \uc774 \ub450 \ub2e8\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \ubbfc\uac10\ub3c4\uc640 \uc801\uc740 \ub204\ub77d \uc0ac\ub840\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc870\uae30 \uace0\uad00\uc808 \uace8\uc808 \uc704\ud5d8 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ube44\uc6a9 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uace0\uad00\uc808 \uace8\uc808\uc740 \ub178\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uc7a5\uc560, \uc0ac\ub9dd \ubc0f \uc758\ub8cc \ubd80\ub2f4\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc6d0\uc778\uc73c\ub85c, \uc870\uae30 \uc704\ud5d8 \ud3c9\uac00\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 DXA T-\uc810\uc218 \ubc0f FRAX\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub294 \uc885\uc885 \ubbfc\uac10\ub3c4\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uace0, \ud2b9\ud788 \uc774\uc804 \uace8\uc808\uc774 \uc5c6\uac70\ub098 \uace8\uac10\uc18c\uc99d\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uace0\uc704\ud5d8 \uac1c\uc778\uc744 \ub193\uce58\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc784\uc0c1 \ubc0f \uc774\ubbf8\uc9d5 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \uc21c\ucc28\uc801 \ub450 \ub2e8\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

In this API-free setting, large language model (LLM)-based\nagents face severe efficiency bottlenecks: limited to local visual experiences,\nthey make myopic decisions and rely on inefficient trial-and-error, hindering\nboth skill acquisition and long-term planning. To address these challenges, we\npropose KG-Agent, an experience-driven learning framework that structures an\nagent's raw pixel-level interactions into a persistent State-Action Knowledge\nGraph (SA-KG). KG-Agent overcomes inefficient exploration by linking\nfunctionally similar but visually distinct GUI states, forming a rich\nneighborhood of experience that enables the agent to generalize from a diverse\nset of historical strategies. To support long-horizon reasoning, we design a\nhybrid intrinsic reward mechanism based on the graph topology, combining a\nstate value reward for exploiting known high-value pathways with a novelty\nreward that encourages targeted exploration. This approach decouples strategic\nplanning from pure discovery, allowing the agent to effectively value setup\nactions with delayed gratification.

We prove\nhigh-probability sensitivity bounds and establish dynamic-regret guarantees of\n$\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$ under KL-drift path length $S_T = \\sum_{t\\ge2}\\sqrt{{\\rm\nKL}(D_t|D_{t-1})/2}$. In particular, trust-decay achieves $O(1)$ per-switch\nregret, while stress-free updates incur $\\Omega(1)$ tails. A parameter-free\nhedge adapts the tilt to unknown drift, whereas persistent over-tilting yields\nan $\\Omega(\\lambda^2 T)$ stationary penalty. We further obtain\ncalibrated-stress bounds and extensions to second-order updates, bandit\nfeedback, outliers, stress variation, distributed optimization, and plug-in\nKL-drift estimation. The framework unifies dynamic-regret analysis,\ndistributionally robust objectives, and KL-regularized control within a single\nstress-adaptive update.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubd84\ud3ec Drift \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc21c\ucc28\uc801\uc778 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uba70, \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \uc815\uaddc\ud654\ub41c \uc2e0\ub8b0 \uac10\uc18c \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc21c\ucc28\uc801 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd84\ud3ec\uac00 \ubcc0\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc0c1\ud669\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud568\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc2e0\ub8b0 \uac10\uc18c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2a4\ud2b8\ub808\uc2a4\uc5d0 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \uc9c0\uc218 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbff\uc74c \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\uc640 \ubbf8\ub7ec-\ud558\uac15 \uacb0\uc815\uc5d0 \uc8fc\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e0\ub8b0 \uac10\uc18c \uae30\ubc95\uc740 O(1)\uc758 \uc804\ud658 \uc190\uc2e4\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ubc18\uba74, \uc2a4\ud2b8\ub808\uc2a4 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub294 \u03a9(1)\uc758 \uaf2c\ub9ac \uc190\uc2e4\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc190\uc2e4 \ubd84\uc11d, \ubd84\ud3ec\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac15\uc778\ud55c \ubaa9\ud45c, KL \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubd84\ud3ec \ub4dc\ub9ac\ud504\ud2b8 \ud558\uc758 \uc21c\ucc28\uc801 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc2e0\ub8b0 \uac10\uc18c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2a4\ud2b8\ub808\uc2a4 \uc778\uc2dd \uc9c0\uc218 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbff\uc74c \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8 \ubc0f \ubbf8\ub7ec-\ud558\uac15 \uacb0\uc815 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0 \uc8fc\uc785\ud558\ub294 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \uc815\uaddc\ud654\ub41c \uc2e0\ub8b0 \uac10\uc18c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2ec\ud50c\ub809\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \ud39c\ucf08-\uc774\uc911 \ub3d9\ub4f1\uc131\uc740 \ubbff\uc74c \uae30\uc6b8\uae30\uc640 \uacb0\uc815 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30\uac00 \uc77c\uce58\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131 (KL \uacf5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ucd5c\uc545\uc758 \ucd08\uacfc \uc704\ud5d8), \ubbff\uc74c \ub300\uc5ed\ud3ed (\ubaa9\ud45c \ucd08\uacfc\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ubc18\uacbd), \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uacb0\uc815 \uacf5\uac04 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131 \uc9c0\uc218 (O(\u221aT) \ud6c4\ud68c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud5c8\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \ub4dc\ub9ac\ud504\ud2b8)\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uac15\uc778\uc131\uc744 \ud615\uc2dd\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uace0\ud655\ub960 \ubbfc\uac10\ub3c4 \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \uc99d\uba85\ud558\uace0 KL-\ub4dc\ub9ac\ud504\ud2b8 \uacbd\ub85c \uae38\uc774 S_T = \u2211_{t\u22652}\u221a{KL(D_t|D_{t-1})/2} \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \ub3d9\uc801 \ud6c4\ud68c\uc758 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uc124\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788, \uc2e0\ub8b0 \uac10\uc18c\ub294 \uc804\ud658 \ub2f9 O(1)\uc758 \ud6c4\ud68c\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ubc18\uba74, \uc2a4\ud2b8\ub808\uc2a4 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub294 \u03a9(1) \uaf2c\ub9ac\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \uc5c6\ub294 \ud5e4\uc9c0\ub294 \uc54c\ub824\uc9c0\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ub4dc\ub9ac\ud504\ud2b8\uc5d0 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30\ub97c \uc870\uc815\ud558\uace0, \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uacfc\ud3b8\ud5a5\uc740 \u03a9(\u03bb^2 T)\uc758 \uc815\uc801 \ud328\ub110\ud2f0\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub610\ud55c \ubcf4\uc815\ub41c \uc2a4\ud2b8\ub808\uc2a4 \uacbd\uacc4 \ubc0f 2\ucc28 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8, \ubc34\ub527 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31, \uc774\uc0c1\uce58, \uc2a4\ud2b8\ub808\uc2a4 \ubcc0\ub3d9, \ubd84\uc0b0 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubc0f \ud50c\ub7ec\uadf8\uc778 KL-\ub4dc\ub9ac\ud504\ud2b8 \ucd94\uc815\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5\uc744 \ucd94\uac00\ub85c \uc5bb\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc190\uc2e4 \ubd84\uc11d, \ubd84\ud3ec\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac15\uc778\ud55c \ubaa9\ud45c \ubc0f KL \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Beyond accelerating tasks such as hypothesis\ngeneration, experimental design, and result interpretation, they prompt a more\nfundamental question: Are FMs merely enhancing existing scientific\nmethodologies, or are they redefining the way science is conducted? In this\npaper, we argue that FMs are catalyzing a transition toward a new scientific\nparadigm. We introduce a three-stage framework to describe this evolution: (1)\nMeta-Scientific Integration, where FMs enhance workflows within traditional\nparadigms; (2) Hybrid Human-AI Co-Creation, where FMs become active\ncollaborators in problem formulation, reasoning, and discovery; and (3)\nAutonomous Scientific Discovery, where FMs operate as independent agents\ncapable of generating new scientific knowledge with minimal human intervention.\nThrough this lens, we review current applications and emerging capabilities of\nFMs across existing scientific paradigms.

Operator theory\nviews such dynamics as linear maps on Hilbert spaces containing mean embedding\nvectors of distributions, offering an appealing but currently overlooked\nperspective. We propose a new approach to sequence modeling based on an\noperator-theoretic view of a hidden Markov model (HMM). Instead of\nmaterializing stochastic recurrence, we embed the full sequence distribution as\na tensor in the product Hilbert space. A generative process is then defined as\nmaximum mean discrepancy (MMD) gradient flow in the space of sequences. To\novercome challenges with large tensors and slow sampling convergence, we\nintroduce spectral mean flows, a novel tractable algorithm integrating two core\nconcepts. First, we propose a new neural architecture by leveraging spectral\ndecomposition of linear operators to derive a scalable tensor network\ndecomposition of sequence mean embeddings. Second, we extend MMD gradient flows\nto time-dependent Hilbert spaces and connect them to flow matching via the\ncontinuity equation, enabling simulation-free learning and faster sampling. We\ndemonstrate competitive results on a range of time-series modeling datasets.\nCode is available at https://github.com/jw9730/spectral-mean-flow.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8

To address this challenge, we propose VERITAS, a pipeline\nthat systematically integrates vision priors and multiple state-of-the-art LMMs\nwith statistical methods to enhance SFT data quality. VERITAS leverages visual\nrecognition models (RAM++) and OCR systems (PP-OCRv4) to extract structured\nvision priors, which are combined with images, questions, and answers. Three\nLMMs (GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-Pro, Doubao-1.5-pro) evaluate the original answers,\nproviding critique rationales and scores that are statistically fused into a\nhigh-confidence consensus score serving as ground truth. Using this consensus,\nwe train a lightweight critic model via Group Relative Policy Optimization\n(GRPO), enhancing reasoning capabilities efficiently. Each LMM then refines the\noriginal answers based on the critiques, generating new candidate answers; we\nselect the highest-scoring one as the final refined answer. Experiments across\nsix multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that models fine-tuned with data\nprocessed by VERITAS consistently outperform those using raw data, particularly\nin text-rich and fine-grained reasoning tasks.

However,\npartially learned goals will often incentivize an AI to avoid further goal\nupdates, as most goals are better achieved by an AI continuing to pursue them.\nWe say that a goal is corrigible if it does not incentivize taking actions that\navoid proper goal updates or shutdown. In addition to convergence in training,\ncorrigibility also allows for correcting mistakes and changes in human\npreferences, which makes it a crucial safety property. Despite this, the\nexisting literature does not include specifications for goals that are both\ncorrigible and competitive with non-corrigible alternatives. We provide a\nformal definition for corrigibility, then introduce a transformation that\nconstructs a corrigible version of any goal that can be made corrigible,\nwithout sacrificing performance. This is done by myopically eliciting\npredictions of reward conditional on costlessly preventing updates, which then\nalso determine the reward when updates are accepted. The transformation can be\nmodified to recursively extend corrigibility to any new agents created by\ncorrigible agents, and to prevent agents from deliberately modifying their\ngoals.

This issue is exacerbated in parallel\nsampling methods, where multiple outputs are drawn from the same distribution,\npotentially causing the model to converge to similar solutions. We propose\nSESA, a novel SEquential SAmpling framework that mitigates this challenge by\ngenerating diverse solution sketches sequentially before expanding them into\nfull reasoning paths. This approach ensures broader exploration by conditioning\neach new output on previous ones, promoting diversity throughout the process\nand preventing policy collapse. Our experiments on a synthetic task show that\nsequential sampling consistently outperforms traditional RL methods in terms of\npath diversity and recovery from collapse. Further evaluations on real-world\ntasks demonstrate that SESA improves both the exploration of valid strategies\nand the overall performance of LLMs. On three agent benchmarks, SESA lifts\nsuccess rates by $+0.25$, $+0.42$, and $+0.07$ absolute over the base model (up\nto an additional $211\\%$ relative improvement over baseline RL), underscoring\nits exploration advantage. This work introduces a structured approach to\nexploration, paving the way for more effective and diverse reasoning in\nRL-trained LLMs. Our code is released at https://github.com/MuLabPKU/sesa.", "AI": {"tldr": "SESA\ub294 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ucc44\ud0dd\ub41c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc21c\ucc28 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uc815\ucc45 \ubd95\uad34\ub97c \ubc29\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uc81c\ud55c\uacfc \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \ubd95\uad34 \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "SESA\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud574\uacb0\ucc45 \uc2a4\ucf00\uce58\ub97c \uc21c\ucc28\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \uc804\uccb4 \ucd94\ub860 \uacbd\ub85c\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\ucc45 \ubd95\uad34\ub97c \ubc29\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "SESA\ub294 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 RL \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uacbd\ub85c \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uacfc \ubd95\uad34 \ud68c\ubcf5 \uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec RL\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c LLM\uc5d0\uc11c \ub354 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc740 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud574\uc654\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc885\uc885 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ud0d0\uc0c9\uacfc \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \ubd95\uad34 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud558\uac8c \ub41c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc881\uc740 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158 \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uac8c \ub418\uc5b4 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uc774 \uc0c1\uc2e4\ub418\uace0 \uc774\ud6c4 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc774 \uc800\ud574\ub41c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \ubd84\ud3ec\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5ec\ub7ec \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\ub294 \ubcd1\ub82c \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0\uc11c \ub354\uc6b1 \uc2ec\ud654\ub418\uba70, \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ub834\ud560 \uc704\ud5d8\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158 \uc2a4\ucf00\uce58\ub97c \uc21c\ucc28\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c \ud6c4 \uc774\ub97c \uc804\uccb4 \ucd94\ub860 \uacbd\ub85c\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc644\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc21c\ucc28 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 SESA\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uac01 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \uc774\uc804 \ucd9c\ub825\uc5d0 \uc870\uac74\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub113\uc740 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uba70, \uacfc\uc815 \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uc744 \uc99d\uc9c4\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uc815\ucc45 \ubd95\uad34\ub97c \ubc29\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud569\uc131 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc21c\ucc28 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uc774 \uacbd\ub85c \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uacfc \ubd95\uad34 \ud68c\ubcf5 \uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 RL \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4. \uc2e4\uc81c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucd94\uac00 \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 SESA\uac00 \uc720\ud6a8\ud55c \uc804\ub7b5 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uacfc LLM\uc758 \uc804\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c SESA\ub294 \uae30\ubcf8 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \uac01\uac01 +0.25, +0.42, +0.07 \ub9cc\ud07c \uc808\ub300\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf1c(\uae30\ubcf8 RL \ub300\ube44 \ucd5c\ub300 211%\uc758 \uc0c1\ub300\uc801 \uac1c\uc120), \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uc6b0\uc704\ub97c \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec RL\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c LLM\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4."}}

While reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective for\nenhancing reasoning in single-agent tasks, its extension to multi-turn,\nmulti-agent scenarios remains underexplored due to the challenges of\nlong-horizon credit assignment and agent-specific advantage estimation. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce MARS, an end-to-end RL framework that\nincentivizes Multi-Agent Reasoning of LLMs through Self-play in both\ncooperative and competitive games. MARS features a turn-level advantage\nestimator that aligns learning signals with each interaction for credit\nassignment, and an agent-specific advantage normalization to stabilize\nmulti-agent training. By learning with self-play across cooperative and\ncompetitive games, the MARS agent trained from Qwen3-4B develops strong\nstrategic abilities that generalize to held-out games with up to 28.7%\nperformance improvements. More importantly, the capability acquired through\nself-play generalizes beyond games, yielding consistent performance gains of\nmulti-agent systems in reasoning benchmarks. When integrated into leading\nmulti-agent systems, our MARS agent achieves significant performance gains of\n10.0% on AIME and 12.5% on GPQA-Diamond. These results establish end-to-end RL\ntraining with self-play in strategic games as a powerful approach for\ndeveloping generalizable multi-agent reasoning capabilities in LLMs. Our code\nand models are publicly available at https://github.com/thu-nics/MARS.", "AI": {"tldr": "MARS\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud611\ub825 \ubc0f \uacbd\uc7c1\uc5d0\uc11c LLM\uc758 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc885\ub2e8 \uac04 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, Qwen3-4B\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud6c8\ub828\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uae30\uc5ec\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub354\uc6b1 \uc9c4\ubcf4\ub41c \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c LLM\uc774 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud611\ub825\ud558\uace0 \uacbd\uc7c1\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "MARS\ub294 \ud611\ub825 \ubc0f \uacbd\uc7c1 \uac8c\uc784\uc5d0\uc11c LLM\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc885\ub2e8 \uac04 RL \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \ud134 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc774\uc810 \ucd94\uc815\uae30\uc640 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc774\uc810 \uc815\uaddc\ud654\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "MARS\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 10.0% \ubc0f 12.5% \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc804\ub7b5 \uac8c\uc784\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uae30 \ub180\uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \uc885\ub2e8 \uac04 RL \ud6c8\ub828\uc774 LLM\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc784\uc744 \ud655\ub9bd\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uba40\ud2f0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ud611\ub825\ud558\uace0 \uacbd\uc7c1\ud558\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc9c4\ubcf4\ub41c \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub2e8\uacc4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc774 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc5d0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \uc785\uc99d\ub418\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc7a5\uae30\uc801\uc778 \uc2e0\uc6a9 \ubc30\ubd84\uacfc \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc774\uc810 \ucd94\uc815\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud134, \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub85c\uc758 \ud655\uc7a5\uc740 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \ud0d0\uad6c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud611\ub825\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uacbd\uc7c1\uc801\uc778 \uac8c\uc784\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uae30 \ub180\uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 LLM\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\ub294 \uc885\ub2e8 \uac04 RL \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 MARS\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

While large language\nmodels (LLMs) have greatly advanced SQL generation though prompting, supervised\nfinetuning and reinforced tuning, the shift toward test-time scaling exposes a\nnew bottleneck: selecting the correct query from a diverse candidate pool.\nExisting selection approaches, such as self-consistency or best-of-$N$\ndecoding, provide only shallow signals, making them prone to inconsistent\nscoring, fragile reasoning chains, and a failure to capture fine-grained\nsemantic distinctions between closely related SQL candidates. To this end, we\nintroduce JudgeSQL, a principled framework that redefines SQL candidate\nselection through structured reasoning and weighted consensus tournament\nmechanism. JudgeSQL develops a reasoning-based SQL judge model that distills\nreasoning traces with reinforcement learning guided by verifiable rewards,\nenabling accurate and interpretable judgments. Building on this, a weighted\nconsensus tournament integrates explicit reasoning preferences with implicit\ngenerator confidence, yielding selections that are both more reliable and more\nefficient. Extensive experiments on the BIRD benchmark demonstrate that\nJudgeSQL exhibits superior SQL judgment capabilities and good cross-scale\ngeneralization and robustness to generator capacity.", "AI": {"tldr": "JudgeSQL \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8-\ud22c-SQL\uc758 \ud6c4\ubcf4 \uc120\ud0dd \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uacfc \uac00\uc911 \ud569\uc758 \ud1a0\ub108\uba3c\ud2b8 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc7ac\uc815\uc758\ud558\uc5ec SQL \ucffc\ub9ac \uc120\ud0dd\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uacfc \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8-\ud22c-SQL \uc791\uc5c5\uc740 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uc774\ud574\uc640 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc811\uadfc\uc744 \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uacfc\uc81c\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \ubaa8\ud638\uc131\uacfc \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc870\ud569\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "JudgeSQL\uc740 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uacfc \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \ucd94\uc801\uc744 \uc815\uc81c\ud558\ub294 SQL \ud310\ubcc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \uc120\ud638\ub3c4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \uac00\uc911 \ud569\uc758 \ud1a0\ub108\uba3c\ud2b8\ub97c \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uacfc \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc778\ub2e4.", "result": "BIRD \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubc29\ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, JudgeSQL\uc740 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c SQL \ud310\ub2e8 \ub2a5\ub825\uacfc \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \ud06c\ub85c\uc2a4 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ubc0f \uc0dd\uc131\uae30 \uc6a9\ub7c9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac15\uc778\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "JudgeSQL\uc740 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8-\ud22c-SQL\uc758 \ud6c4\ubcf4 \uc120\ud0dd\uc5d0\uc11c \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uacfc \uac00\uc911 \ud569\uc758\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc815\ud655\ud558\uace0 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud310\ub2e8\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8-\ud22c-SQL\uc740 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uc774\ud574\uc640 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc811\uadfc\uc744 \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \ubaa8\ud638\uc131\uacfc \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc870\ud569\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8, \uac10\ub3c5\ub41c \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815 \ubc0f \uac15\ud654 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 SQL \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ubc1c\uc804\uc2dc\ucf30\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc2dc\ud5d8 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \uc804\ud658\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131 \uc788\ub294 \ud6c4\ubcf4 \ud480\uc5d0\uc11c \uc62c\ubc14\ub978 \ucffc\ub9ac\ub97c \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \ub178\ucd9c\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc120\ud0dd \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc778 \uc790\uae30 \uc77c\uad00\uc131 \ub610\ub294 N\uac1c \uc911 \ucd5c\uc120 \ub514\ucf54\ub529\uc740 \uc595\uc740 \uc2e0\ud638\ub9cc\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ubbc0\ub85c \ubd88\uc77c\uce58 \uc810\uc218, \ucde8\uc57d\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uccb4\uc778 \ubc0f \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c SQL \ud6c4\ubcf4 \uac04\uc758 \ubbf8\uc138\ud55c \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \uad6c\ubd84\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 JudgeSQL\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4.

We developed a machine learning framework to integrate\ndiverse context from prior visits to improve health monitoring, especially when\nprior visits are limited and their frequency is variable. Our model first\nestimates initial risk of disease using medical data from the most recent\npatient visit, then refines this assessment using information digested from\npreviously collected imaging and/or clinical biomarkers. We applied our\nframework to prostate cancer (PCa) risk prediction using data from a large\npopulation (28,342 patients, 39,013 magnetic resonance imaging scans, 68,931\nblood tests) collected over nearly a decade. For predictions of the risk of\nclinically significant PCa at the time of the visit, integrating prior context\ndirectly converted false positives to true negatives, increasing overall\nspecificity while preserving high sensitivity. False positive rates were\nreduced progressively from 51% to 33% when integrating information from up to\nthree prior imaging examinations, as compared to using data from a single\nvisit, and were further reduced to 24% when also including additional context\nfrom prior clinical data. For predicting the risk of PCa within five years of\nthe visit, incorporating prior context reduced false positive rates still\nfurther (64% to 9%). Our findings show that information collected over time\nprovides relevant context to enhance the specificity of medical risk\nprediction. For a wide range of progressive conditions, sufficient reduction of\nfalse positive rates using context could offer a pathway to expand longitudinal\nhealth monitoring programs to large populations

Its logic-driven operations naturally lend themselves to\nparallel execution on modern CPU architectures. Motivated by this, we propose\nan efficient software implementation of the TM by leveraging instruction-level\nbitwise operations for compact model representation and accelerated processing.\nTo further improve inference speed, we introduce an early exit mechanism, which\nexploits the TM's AND-based clause evaluation to avoid unnecessary\ncomputations.

Although such proofs are mechanically verified by formal systems like\nLean, their excessive length renders them difficult for humans to comprehend\nand limits their usefulness for mathematical insight. Proof simplification is\ntherefore a critical bottleneck. Yet, training data for this task is scarce,\nand existing methods -- mainly agentic scaffolding with off-the-shelf LLMs --\nstruggle with the extremely long proofs generated by RL-trained provers. We\nintroduce ProofOptimizer, the first language model trained to simplify Lean\nproofs without requiring additional human supervision. ProofOptimizer is\ntrained via expert iteration and reinforcement learning, using Lean to verify\nsimplifications and provide training signal. At inference time, it operates\nwithin an iterative proof-shortening workflow, progressively reducing proof\nlength. Experiments show that ProofOptimizer substantially compresses proofs\ngenerated by state-of-the-art RL-trained provers on standard benchmarks,\nreducing proof length by 87% on miniF2F, 57% on PutnamBench, and 49% on\nSeed-Prover's IMO 2025 proofs.

Bailey"], "title": "Self-evolving expertise in complex non-verifiable subject domains: dialogue as implicit meta-RL", "comment": "50 pages, 4 figures", "summary": "So-called `wicked problems', those involving complex multi-dimensional\nsettings, non-verifiable outcomes, heterogeneous impacts and a lack of single\nobjectively correct answers, have plagued humans throughout history. Modern\nexamples include decisions over justice frameworks, solving environmental\npollution, planning for pandemic resilience and food security. The use of\nstate-of-the-art artificial intelligence systems (notably Large Language\nModel-based agents) collaborating with humans on solving such problems is being\nactively explored. While the abilities of LLMs can be improved by, for example,\nfine-tuning, hand-crafted system prompts and scaffolding with external tools,\nLLMs lack endogenous mechanisms to develop expertise through experience in such\nsettings. This work address this gap with Dialectica, a framework where agents\nengage in structured dialogue on defined topics, augmented by memory,\nself-reflection, and policy-constrained context editing. Formally, discussion\nis viewed as an implicit meta-reinforcement learning process. The\n`dialogue-trained' agents are evaluated post-hoc using judged pairwise\ncomparisons of elicited responses.

Since ProSh is model-free, safety during training depends on the\nknowledge we have acquired about the environment.

Yet current agents remain limited by shallow\nretrieval, weak alignment metrics, and brittle tool-use behavior. We introduce\nPokeeResearch-7B, a 7B-parameter deep research agent built under a unified\nreinforcement learning framework for robustness, alignment, and scalability.\nPokeeResearch-7B is trained by an annotation-free Reinforcement Learning from\nAI Feedback (RLAIF) framework to optimize policies using LLM-based reward\nsignals that capture factual accuracy, citation faithfulness, and instruction\nadherence. A chain-of-thought-driven multi-call reasoning scaffold further\nenhances robustness through self-verification and adaptive recovery from tool\nfailures.

In this\nwork, we introduce a novel approach that leverages automaton-based feedback to\nguide the learning process, replacing explicit reward functions with\npreferences derived from a deterministic finite automaton (DFA). Unlike\nconventional approaches that use automata for direct reward specification, our\nmethod employs the structure of the DFA to generate preferences over\ntrajectories that are used to learn a reward function, eliminating the need for\nmanual reward engineering. Our framework introduces a static approach that uses\nthe learned reward function directly for policy optimization and a dynamic\napproach that involves continuous refining of the reward function and policy\nthrough iterative updates until convergence.\n  Our experiments in both discrete and continuous environments demonstrate that\nour approach enables the RL agent to learn effective policies for tasks with\ntemporal dependencies, outperforming traditional reward engineering and\nautomaton-based baselines such as reward machines and LTL-guided methods. Our\nresults highlight the advantages of automaton-based preferences in handling\nnon-Markovian rewards, offering a scalable, efficient, and human-independent\nalternative to traditional reward modeling. We also provide a convergence\nguarantee showing that under standard assumptions our automaton-guided\npreference-based framework learns a policy that is near-optimal with respect to\nthe true non-Markovian objective.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654 \uae30\ubc18 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c
