The protection of agent communication privacy while ensuring auditability emerges as a fundamental challenge for applications requiring accurate billing, compliance verification, and accountability in regulated environments.\n  We introduce a framework for auditing agent communications that keeps messages private while still checking they follow expected rules. It pairs zero-knowledge proofs with the existing Model Context Protocol (MCP) so messages can be verified without revealing their contents. The approach runs in lightweight networks, stays compatible with standard MCP exchanges, and adds asynchronous audit verification to confirm format and general message types without exposing specifics.\n  The framework enables mutual audits between agents: one side can check communication content and quality while the other verifies usage metrics, all without revealing sensitive information. We formalize security goals and show that zk-MCP provides data authenticity and communication privacy, achieving efficient verification with negligible latency overhead. We fully implement the framework, including Circom-based zero-knowledge proof generation and an audit protocol integrated with MCP's bidirectional channel, and, to our knowledge, this is the first privacy-preserving audit system for agent communications that offers verifiable mutual auditing without exposing message content or compromising agent privacy."}

Previous machine learning and deep learning detection tools are constrained by their reliance on large-scale labeled data and an lack of interpretability. Although multi-agent systems have demonstrated robust capabilities, the potential of such systems for PCOS detection remains largely unexplored. Existing medical multi-agent frameworks are predominantly designed for general medical tasks, suffering from insufficient domain integration and a lack of specific domain knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose Mapis, the first knowledge-grounded multi-agent framework explicitly designed for guideline-based PCOS diagnosis. Specifically, it built upon the 2023 International Guideline into a structured collaborative workflow that simulates the clinical diagnostic process. It decouples complex diagnostic tasks across specialized agents: a gynecological endocrine agent and a radiology agent collaborative to verify inclusion criteria, while an exclusion agent strictly rules out other causes. Furthermore, we construct a comprehensive PCOS knowledge graph to ensure verifiable, evidence-based decision-making. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks and specialized clinical datasets, benchmarking against nine diverse baselines, demonstrate that Mapis significantly outperforms competitive methods. On the clinical dataset, it surpasses traditional machine learning models by 13.56%, single-agent by 6.55%, and previous medical multi-agent systems by 7.05% in Accuracy."}

We bridge this gap by proposing a methodology for constructing benchmarks under KG incompleteness, which removes direct supporting triples while ensuring that alternative reasoning paths required to infer the answer remain. Experiments on benchmarks constructed using our methodology show that existing methods suffer consistent performance degradation under incompleteness, highlighting their limited reasoning ability. To overcome this limitation, we present the Adaptive Graph Reasoning Agent (GR-Agent). It first constructs an interactive environment from the KG, and then formalizes KGQA as agent environment interaction within this environment. GR-Agent operates over an action space comprising graph reasoning tools and maintains a memory of potential supporting reasoning evidence, including relevant relations and reasoning paths. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GR-Agent outperforms non-training baselines and performs comparably to training-based methods under both complete and incomplete settings."}

We initially hypothesized that a novel Quad-Modal Hierarchical Gated Attention Network -- termed SepsisFusionFormer -- would resolve complex cross-modal interactions between vitals, text, and imaging. However, experiments on MIMIC-IV revealed that SepsisFusionFormer suffered from \"attention starvation\" in the small antibiotic cohort ($N \\approx 2,100$), resulting in overfitting (AUC 0.66). This counterintuitive result informed the design of SepsisLateFusion, a \"leaner\" Context-Aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. By treating modalities as orthogonal experts -- the \"Historian\" (Static), the \"Monitor\" (Temporal), and the \"Reader\" (NLP) -- and dynamically gating them via a CatBoost meta-learner, we achieved State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance: 0.915 AUC for prediction 4 hours prior to clinical onset. By calibrating the decision threshold for clinical safety, we reduced missed cases by 48% relative to the default operating point, thus opening a true preventative window for timely intervention over reactive alerts.

Specifically, CogER first assesses the complexity of incoming queries and assigns them to one of several predefined levels, each corresponding to a tailored processing strategy, thereby addressing the challenge of unobservable query difficulty. To achieve automatic strategy selection, we model the process as a Markov Decision Process and train a CogER-Agent using reinforcement learning. The agent is guided by a reward function that balances solution quality and computational cost, ensuring resource-efficient reasoning. Moreover, for queries requiring external tools, we introduce Cognitive Tool-Assisted Reasoning, which enables the LLM to autonomously invoke external tools within its chain-of-thought.

However, we show that the off-policy nature of imitation learning for multi-turn LM agents suffers from the fundamental limitation known as covariate shift: as the student policy's behavior diverges from the expert's, it encounters states not present in the training data, reducing the effectiveness of fine-tuning. Taking inspiration from the classic DAgger algorithm, we propose a novel data generation methodology for addressing covariate shift for multi-turn LLM training. We introduce on-policy expert corrections (OECs), partially on-policy data generated by starting rollouts with a student model and then switching to an expert model part way through the trajectory. We explore the effectiveness of our data generation technique in the domain of software engineering (SWE) tasks, a multi-turn setting where LLM agents must interact with a development environment to fix software bugs. Our experiments compare OEC data against various other on-policy and imitation learning approaches on SWE agent problems and train models using a common rejection sampling (i.e., using environment reward) combined with supervised fine-tuning technique. Experiments find that OEC trajectories show a relative 14% and 13% improvement over traditional imitation learning in the 7b and 32b setting, respectively, on SWE-bench verified. Our results demonstrate the need for combining expert demonstrations with on-policy data for effective multi-turn LM agent training."}

The PKB, comprising 1,008 expert-validated workflow cases across 162 practical RS tasks, guides planning and substantially reduces hallucinations common in general-purpose agents. During runtime failures, the Dynamic Workflow Adjustment autonomously diagnoses and replans recovery strategies, while the Evolutionary Memory Module continuously learns from these events, iteratively enhancing the agent's knowledge and performance. This synergy enables CangLing-KnowFlow to adapt, learn, and operate reliably across diverse, complex tasks. We evaluated CangLing-KnowFlow on the KnowFlow-Bench, a novel benchmark of 324 workflows inspired by real-world applications, testing its performance across 13 top Large Language Model (LLM) backbones, from open-source to commercial. Across all complex tasks, CangLing-KnowFlow surpassed the Reflexion baseline by at least 4% in Task Success Rate.

Claude Sonnet 4.5 successfully executes sabotage while evading monitoring by GPT-4.1 mini 26% of the time, at 4% trajectory-wise FPR.

However, these processes are non-Markovian and lack a semimartingale structure, rendering many classical parameter estimation techniques inapplicable or computationally intractable beyond very specific cases. This work investigates two central questions: (i) whether integrating path signatures into deep learning architectures can improve the trade-off between estimation accuracy and model complexity, and (ii) what constitutes an effective architecture for leveraging signatures as feature maps. We introduce SigMA (Signature Multi-head Attention), a neural architecture that integrates path signatures with multi-head self-attention, supported by a convolutional preprocessing layer and a multilayer perceptron for effective feature encoding. SigMA learns model parameters from synthetically generated paths of fBm-driven SDEs, including fractional Brownian motion, fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, and rough Heston models, with a particular focus on estimating the Hurst parameter and on joint multi-parameter inference, and it generalizes robustly to unseen trajectories. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and two real-world datasets (i.e., equity-index realized volatility and Li-ion battery degradation) show that SigMA consistently outperforms CNN, LSTM, vanilla Transformer, and Deep Signature baselines in accuracy, robustness, and model compactness. These results demonstrate that combining signature transforms with attention-based architectures provides an effective and scalable framework for parameter inference in stochastic systems with rough or persistent temporal structure."}

Speculative decoding mitigates this cost through a draft-verify scheme, yet existing approaches rely on AR draft models (a.k.a., drafters), which introduce two fundamental issues: (1) step-wise uncertainty accumulation leads to a progressive collapse of trust between the target model and the drafter, and (2) inherently sequential decoding of AR drafters. Together, these factors cause limited speedups. In this paper, we show that a diffusion large language model (dLLM) drafters can naturally overcome these issues through its fundamentally different probabilistic modeling and efficient parallel decoding strategy. Building on this insight, we introduce DEER, an efficient speculative decoding framework that drafts with diffusion and verifies with AR models. To enable high-quality drafting, DEER employs a two-stage training pipeline to align the dLLM-based drafters with the target AR model, and further adopts single-step decoding to generate long draft segments. Experiments show DEER reaches draft acceptance lengths of up to 32 tokens, far surpassing the 10 tokens achieved by EAGLE-3.

To overcome the above challenges, we utilize a pre-trained CBraMod encoder for EEG and pre-train a symmetric ECG encoder, equipping each modality with a rich foundational representation.

While the value alignment literature has developed techniques for shaping AI values, less attention has been paid to how to determine, under uncertainty, when imperfect alignment is good enough to justify delegation. We argue that rational delegation requires balancing an agent's value (mis)alignment with its epistemic accuracy and its reach (the acts it has available). This paper introduces a formal, decision-theoretic framework to analyze this tradeoff precisely accounting for a principal's uncertainty about these factors. Our analysis reveals a sharp distinction between two delegation scenarios. First, universal delegation (trusting an agent with any problem) demands near-perfect value alignment and total epistemic trust, conditions rarely met in practice. Second, we show that context-specific delegation can be optimal even with significant misalignment. An agent's superior accuracy or expanded reach may grant access to better overall decision problems, making delegation rational in expectation. We develop a novel scoring framework to quantify this ex ante decision. Ultimately, our work provides a principled method for determining when an AI is aligned enough for a given context, shifting the focus from achieving perfect alignment to managing the risks and rewards of delegation under uncertainty."}

We bridge this gap by proposing a methodology for constructing benchmarks under KG incompleteness, which removes direct supporting triples while ensuring that alternative reasoning paths required to infer the answer remain. Experiments on benchmarks constructed using our methodology show that existing methods suffer consistent performance degradation under incompleteness, highlighting their limited reasoning ability. To overcome this limitation, we present the Adaptive Graph Reasoning Agent (GR-Agent).

We initially hypothesized that a novel Quad-Modal Hierarchical Gated Attention Network -- termed SepsisFusionFormer -- would resolve complex cross-modal interactions between vitals, text, and imaging. However, experiments on MIMIC-IV revealed that SepsisFusionFormer suffered from \"attention starvation\" in the small antibiotic cohort ($N \\approx 2,100$), resulting in overfitting (AUC 0.66). This counterintuitive result informed the design of SepsisLateFusion, a \"leaner\" Context-Aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. By treating modalities as orthogonal experts -- the \"Historian\" (Static), the \"Monitor\" (Temporal), and the \"Reader\" (NLP) -- and dynamically gating them via a CatBoost meta-learner, we achieved State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance: 0.915 AUC for prediction 4 hours prior to clinical onset. By calibrating the decision threshold for clinical safety, we reduced missed cases by 48% relative to the default operating point, thus opening a true preventative window for timely intervention over reactive alerts.

It is especially important to watermark LLM-generated code, as it often contains intellectual property.However, we found that existing methods for watermarking LLM-generated code fail to address comment removal attack.In such cases, an attacker can simply remove the comments from the generated code without affecting its functionality, significantly reducing the effectiveness of current code-watermarking techniques.On the other hand, injecting a watermark into code is challenging because, as previous works have noted, most code represents a low-entropy scenario compared to natural language. Our approach to addressing this issue involves leveraging prior knowledge to distinguish between low-entropy and high-entropy parts of the code, as indicated by a Cue List of words.We then inject the watermark guided by this Cue List, achieving higher detectability and usability than existing methods.We evaluated our proposed method on HumanEvaland compared our method with three state-of-the-art code watermarking techniques. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."}

We present the Multi-Agent LLM Cyber Defense Framework (MALCDF), a practical setup where four large language model (LLM) agents-Detection, Intelligence, Response, and Analysis-work together in real time. Agents communicate over a Secure Communication Layer (SCL) with encrypted, ontology-aligned messages, and produce audit-friendly outputs (e.g., MITRE ATT&CK mappings).\n  For evaluation, we keep the test simple and consistent: all reported metrics come from the same 50-record live stream derived from the CICIDS2017 feature schema. CICIDS2017 is used for configuration (fields/schema) and to train a practical ML baseline. The ML-IDS baseline is a Lightweight Random Forest IDS (LRF-IDS) trained on a subset of CICIDS2017 and tested on the 50-record stream, with no overlap between training and test records.\n  In experiments, MALCDF reaches 90.0% detection accuracy, 85.7% F1-score, and 9.1% false-positive rate, with 6.8s average per-event latency. It outperforms the lightweight ML-IDS baseline and a single-LLM setup on accuracy while keeping end-to-end outputs consistent. Overall, this hands-on build suggests that coordinating simple LLM agents with secure, ontology-aligned messaging can improve practical, real-time cyber defense."}

Although recent work by Unit 42 at Palo Alto Networks demonstrated that ChatGPT-4o successfully executes attacks as an agent that it refuses in chat mode, there is no comparative analysis in multiple models and frameworks. We conducted the first systematic penetration testing and comparative evaluation of agentic AI systems, testing five prominent models (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash, GPT-4o, Grok 2, and Nova Pro) across two agentic AI frameworks (AutoGen and CrewAI) using a seven-agent architecture that mimics the functionality of a university information management system and 13 distinct attack scenarios that span prompt injection, Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF), SQL injection, and tool misuse. Our 130 total test cases reveal significant security disparities: AutoGen demonstrates a 52.3% refusal rate versus CrewAI's 30.8%, while model performance ranges from Nova Pro's 46.2% to Claude and Grok 2's 38.5%. Most critically, Grok 2 on CrewAI rejected only 2 of 13 attacks (15.4% refusal rate), and the overall refusal rate of 41.5% across all configurations indicates that more than half of malicious prompts succeeded despite enterprise-grade safety mechanisms. We identify six distinct defensive behavior patterns including a novel \"hallucinated compliance\" strategy where models fabricate outputs rather than executing or refusing attacks, and provide actionable recommendations for secure agent deployment. Complete attack prompts are also included in the Appendix to enable reproducibility."}

In this paper, we introduce \"OLR-WA; OnLine Regression with Weighted Average\", a novel and versatile multivariate online linear regression model. We also investigate scenarios involving drift, where the underlying patterns in the data evolve over time, conduct convergence analysis, and compare our approach with existing online regression models. The results of OLR-WA demonstrate its ability to achieve performance comparable to the batch regression, while also showcasing comparable or superior performance when compared with other state-of-the-art online models, thus establishing its effectiveness. Moreover, OLR-WA exhibits exceptional performance in terms of rapid convergence, surpassing other online models with consistently achieving high r2 values as a performance measure from the first iteration to the last iteration, even when initialized with minimal amount of data points, as little as 1% to 10% of the total data points. In addition to its ability to handle time-based (temporal drift) scenarios, remarkably, OLR-WA stands out as the only model capable of effectively managing confidence-based challenging scenarios. It achieves this by adopting a conservative approach in its updates, giving priority to older data points with higher confidence levels. In summary, OLR-WA's performance further solidifies its versatility and utility across different contexts, making it a valuable solution for online linear regression tasks."}

However, we show that the off-policy nature of imitation learning for multi-turn LM agents suffers from the fundamental limitation known as covariate shift: as the student policy's behavior diverges from the expert's, it encounters states not present in the training data, reducing the effectiveness of fine-tuning. Taking inspiration from the classic DAgger algorithm, we propose a novel data generation methodology for addressing covariate shift for multi-turn LLM training. We introduce on-policy expert corrections (OECs), partially on-policy data generated by starting rollouts with a student model and then switching to an expert model part way through the trajectory. We explore the effectiveness of our data generation technique in the domain of software engineering (SWE) tasks, a multi-turn setting where LLM agents must interact with a development environment to fix software bugs. Our experiments compare OEC data against various other on-policy and imitation learning approaches on SWE agent problems and train models using a common rejection sampling (i.e., using environment reward) combined with supervised fine-tuning technique. Experiments find that OEC trajectories show a relative 14% and 13% improvement over traditional imitation learning in the 7b and 32b setting, respectively, on SWE-bench verified. Our results demonstrate the need for combining expert demonstrations with on-policy data for effective multi-turn LM agent training."}

Speculative decoding mitigates this cost through a draft-verify scheme, yet existing approaches rely on AR draft models (a.k.a., drafters), which introduce two fundamental issues: (1) step-wise uncertainty accumulation leads to a progressive collapse of trust between the target model and the drafter, and (2) inherently sequential decoding of AR drafters. Together, these factors cause limited speedups. In this paper, we show that a diffusion large language model (dLLM) drafters can naturally overcome these issues through its fundamentally different probabilistic modeling and efficient parallel decoding strategy. Building on this insight, we introduce DEER, an efficient speculative decoding framework that drafts with diffusion and verifies with AR models. To enable high-quality drafting, DEER employs a two-stage training pipeline to align the dLLM-based drafters with the target AR model, and further adopts single-step decoding to generate long draft segments. Experiments show DEER reaches draft acceptance lengths of up to 32 tokens, far surpassing the 10 tokens achieved by EAGLE-3. Moreover, on HumanEval with Qwen3-30B-A3B, DEER attains a 5.54x speedup, while EAGLE-3 achieves only 2.41x. Code, model, demo, etc, will be available at https://czc726.github.io/DEER/"}

In this work, we adapt the CBraMod encoder for large-scale self-supervised ECG pretraining, introducing a dual-masking strategy to capture intra- and inter-lead dependencies. To overcome the above challenges, we utilize a pre-trained CBraMod encoder for EEG and pre-train a symmetric ECG encoder, equipping each modality with a rich foundational representation. These representations are then fused via simple embedding concatenation, allowing the classification head to learn cross-modal interactions, together enabling effective downstream learning despite limited multi-modal supervision. Evaluated on emotion recognition, our approach achieves near state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating that carefully designed physiological encoders, even with straightforward fusion, substantially improve downstream performance. These results highlight the potential of foundation-model approaches to harness the holistic nature of physiological signals, enabling scalable, label-efficient, and generalizable solutions for healthcare and affective computing."}

Using a newly constructed rotor dataset acquired with a synchronized three-axis sensor, we evaluate six deep learning architectures under a two-stage learning framework. Results demonstrate architecture-independent improvements: the three-axis independent method achieves consistent gains (+2.7\\% for Transformer), while the single-axis reference approach delivers superior performance with up to 96.2\\% accuracy (+5.4\\%) by preserving spatial phase relationships.
