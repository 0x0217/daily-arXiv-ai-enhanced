This paper proposes a retrieval-augmented, multi-agent framework that combines retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and collaborative multi-agent reasoning for WiP prediction. The narrative generation component transforms structured event logs into semantically rich natural language stories, which are embedded into a semantic vector-based process memory to facilitate dynamic retrieval of historical context during inference. The framework includes predictor agents that independently leverage retrieved historical contexts and a decision-making assistant agent that extracts high-level descriptive signals from recent events. A fusion agent then synthesizes predictions using ReAct-style reasoning over agent outputs and retrieved narratives. We evaluate our framework on two real-world benchmark datasets. Results show that the proposed retrieval-augmented multi-agent approach achieves competitive prediction accuracy, obtaining a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 1.50\\% on one dataset, and surpassing Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and persistence baselines. The results highlight improved robustness, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating retrieval mechanisms and multi-agent reasoning in WiP prediction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc9c4\ud589 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud68c\uc218 \uc99d\ub300 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc791\uc5c5 \uc9c4\ud589 \uc608\uce21\uc740 \uc608\uce21 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc694\uc18c\ub85c, \uc791\uc5c5 \ubd80\ud558 \ubcc0\ud654\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc608\uce21\uacfc \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uc6b4\uc601 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud68c\uc218 \uc99d\ub300 \uc0dd\uc131(RAG)\uacfc \ud611\uc5c5 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc0ac\uac74 \ub85c\uadf8\ub97c \uc758\ubbf8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uc774\uc57c\uae30\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \uae30\uc900 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ud68c\uc218 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uacfc \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ucd94\ub860 \ud1b5\ud569\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uba70, \ub354\uc6b1 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub41c \uacac\uace0\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc791\uc5c5 \uc9c4\ud589(WiP) \uc608\uce21\uc740 \uc608\uce21 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc911\uc694\ud558\uba70, \uc791\uc5c5 \ubd80\ud558 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc744 \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \uc608\uce21\ud558\uace0 \uc6b4\uc601 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud574\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 WiP \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ud68c\uc218 \uc99d\ub300 \uc0dd\uc131(RAG)\uacfc \ud611\uc5c5 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \ud68c\uc218 \uc99d\ub300 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc11c\uc0ac \uc0dd\uc131 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8 \ub85c\uadf8\ub97c \uc758\ubbf8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uc774\uc57c\uae30\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \uc758\ubbf8 \ubca1\ud130 \uae30\ubc18 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ub0b4\uc7a5\ud558\uc5ec \ucd94\ub860 \uc911 \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc758 \ub3d9\uc801 \ud68c\uc218\ub97c \ucd09\uc9c4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud68c\uc218\ub41c \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc608\uce21\uae30 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \ucd5c\uadfc \uc0ac\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c \ub192\uc740 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uae30\uc220 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\ub294 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \ubcf4\uc870 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8 \ud6c4 \uc735\ud569 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ucd9c\ub825 \ubc0f \ud68c\uc218\ub41c \uc11c\uc0ac\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 ReAct \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc885\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \uae30\uc900 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ud68c\uc218 \uc99d\ub300 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0 \ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uade0 \uc808\ub300 \ubc31\ubd84\uc728 \uc624\ucc28(MAPE)\uac00 1.50%\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c Temporal Convolutional Networks(TCN), Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM) \ubc0f \uc9c0\uc18d\uc131 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \ucd08\uc6d4\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub41c \uacac\uace0\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70, WiP \uc608\uce21\uc5d0\uc11c \ud68c\uc218 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uacfc \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ucd94\ub860\uc758 \ud1b5\ud569 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

These idealized assumptions stand in stark contrast with human decision making in real world environments. The natural strategies framework along with some of its recent variants, partially addresses this gap by restricting strategies to concise rules guarded by regular expressions. Yet, it still overlook both the cost of each action and the uncertainty that often characterizes human perception of facts over the time. In this work, we introduce HumanATLF, a logic that builds upon natural strategies employing both fuzzy semantics and resource bound actions: each action carries a real valued cost drawn from a non refillable budget, and atomic conditions and goals have degrees in [0,1]. We give a formal syntax and semantics, and prove that model checking is in P when both the strategy complexity k and resource budget b are fixed, NP complete if just one strategic operator over Boolean objectives is allowed, and Delta^P_2 complete when k and b vary. Moreover, we show that recall based strategies can be decided in PSPACE.

We propose a multi-agent framework in which a master LLM coordinates a grounding agent to localize question-relevant segments and a vision agent to extract targeted textual observations. The master agent plans with a step limit, and is trained with reinforcement learning to encourage concise, correct, and efficient multi-agent cooperation. This design helps the master agent focus on relevant clips via grounding, complements subtitles with visual detail, and yields interpretable trajectories. On our proposed LongTVQA and LongTVQA+ which are episode-level datasets aggregated from TVQA/TVQA+, our multi-agent system significantly outperforms strong non-agent baselines. Experiments also show reinforcement learning further strengthens reasoning and planning for the trained agent.

They typically come in two flavors: proof of work (PoW) and proof of stake (PoS), and both are vulnerable to attacks. PoS protocols suffer from long-range attacks, wherein attackers alter execution history at little cost, and PoW protocols are vulnerable to attackers with enough computational power to subvert execution history. PoS protocols respond by relying on external mechanisms like social consensus; PoW protocols either fall back to probabilistic guarantees, or are slow.\n  We present Sieve-MMR, the first fully-permissionless protocol with deterministic security and constant expected latency that does not rely on external mechanisms. We obtain Sieve-MMR by porting a PoS protocol (MMR) to the PoW setting. From MMR we inherit constant expected latency and deterministic security, and proof-of-work gives us resilience against long-range attacks. The main challenge to porting MMR to the PoW setting is what we call time-travel attacks, where attackers use PoWs generated in the distant past to increase their perceived PoW power in the present. We respond by proposing Sieve, a novel algorithm that implements a new broadcast primitive we dub time-travel-resilient broadcast (TTRB). Sieve relies on a black-box, deterministic PoW primitive to implement TTRB, which we use as the messaging layer for MMR.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc678\ubd80 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uacb0\uc815\ub860\uc801 \ubcf4\uc548\uacfc \uc77c\uc815\ud55c \uc608\uc0c1 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \uc644\uc804 \ube44\ud5c8\uac00 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc778 Sieve-MMR\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ube44\ud5c8\uac00 \ube14\ub85d\uccb4\uc778\uc740 \uc54c\ub824\uc9c0\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ub178\ub4dc\uac00 \uc5b8\uc81c\ub4e0\uc9c0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ucc38\uc5ec\ud558\uace0 \ub5a0\ub0a0 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0\uc11c \ud569\uc758\ub97c \uc774\ub8e8\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874\uc758 PoW \ubc0f PoS \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc740 \uac01\uac01\uc758 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "Sieve-MMR\uc740 \uae30\uc874\uc758 PoS \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc778 MMR\uc744 PoW \ud658\uacbd\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\uc2dd\ud558\uc5ec \uc5bb\uc740 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 MMR\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\uc815\ud55c \uc608\uc0c1 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc2dc\uac04\uacfc \uacb0\uc815\ub860\uc801 \ubcf4\uc548\uc744 \uc0c1\uc18d\ubc1b\uace0, PoW\ub294 \uc7a5\uac70\ub9ac \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud68c\ubcf5\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "MMR\uc744 PoW \ud658\uacbd\uc73c\ub85c \ud3ec\ud305\ud558\ub294 \uc8fc\uc694 \ub3c4\uc804\uc740 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc5ec\ud589 \uacf5\uaca9\uc774\ub77c\uace0 \ubd88\ub9ac\ub294 \uacf5\uaca9 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc804\ud30c \uc6d0\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ud574\ub2f9\ud558\ub294 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc5ec\ud589 \ubcf5\uc6d0 \uc804\ud30c(TTRB)\ub97c \uad6c\ud604\ud558\ub294 Sieve\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Sieve\ub294 TTRB\ub97c \uad6c\ud604\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ube14\ub799 \ubc15\uc2a4 \ud615\ud0dc\uc758 \uacb0\uc815\ub860\uc801 PoW \uc6d0\ub9ac\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c MMR\uc758 \uba54\uc2dc\uc9d5 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ube44\ud5c8\uac00 \ube14\ub85d\uccb4\uc778\uc740 \uc54c\ub824\uc9c0\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ub178\ub4dc\uac00 \uc5b8\uc81c\ub4e0\uc9c0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ucc38\uc5ec\ud558\uace0 \ub5a0\ub0a0 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0\uc11c \ud569\uc758\ub97c \uc774\ub8e8\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub4e4\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\uc5c5 \uc99d\uba85(Proof of Work, PoW)\uacfc \uc9c0\ubd84 \uc99d\uba85(Proof of Stake, PoS)\uc758 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud615\ud0dc\ub85c \uc81c\uacf5\ub418\uba70, \ub458 \ub2e4 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\ub2e4.

The objective was to develop a multimodal deep learning model, using structured and unstructured clinical data, to predict in-hospital mortality risk among critically ill patients after their initial 24 hour intensive care unit (ICU) admission. We used data from MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV, eICU, and HiRID. A multimodal model was developed on the MIMIC datasets, featuring time series components occurring within the first 24 hours of ICU admission and predicting risk of subsequent inpatient mortality. Inputs included time-invariant variables, time-variant variables, clinical notes, and chest X-ray images. External validation occurred in a temporally separated MIMIC population, HiRID, and eICU datasets. A total of 203,434 ICU admissions from more than 200 hospitals between 2001 to 2022 were included, in which mortality rate ranged from 5.2% to 7.9% across the four datasets. The model integrating structured data points had AUROC, AUPRC, and Brier scores of 0.92, 0.53, and 0.19, respectively. We externally validated the model on eight different institutions within the eICU dataset, demonstrating AUROCs ranging from 0.84-0.92. When including only patients with available clinical notes and imaging data, inclusion of notes and imaging into the model, the AUROC, AUPRC, and Brier score improved from 0.87 to 0.89, 0.43 to 0.48, and 0.37 to 0.17, respectively.

However, existing studies mainly evaluate such systems on well-defined benchmarks or general tasks like literature retrieval, limiting their end-to-end problem-solving ability in open scientific scenarios. This is particularly true in physics, which is abstract, mathematically intensive, and requires integrating analytical reasoning with code-based computation. To address this, we propose PhysMaster, an LLM-based agent functioning as an autonomous theoretical and computational physicist. PhysMaster couples absract reasoning with numerical computation and leverages LANDAU, the Layered Academic Data Universe, which preserves retrieved literature, curated prior knowledge, and validated methodological traces, enhancing decision reliability and stability.

In recent years, learning-based methods have demonstrated promising prospects in detecting various types of malicious activities. However, in real-network operation and maintenance scenarios, leveraging learning-based methods for BAC detection faces two critical challenges. Firstly, under the RESTful API design principles, most systems omit recording composite traffic for performance, and together with ethical and legal bans on directly testing real-world systems, this leads to a critical shortage of training data for detecting BAC violations. Secondly, common malicious behaviors such as SQL injection typically generate individual access traffic that is inherently anomalous. In contrast, BAC is usually composed of multiple correlated access requests that appear normal when examined in isolation. To tackle these problems, we introduce \\BAC, an approach for establishing a BAC violation detection model by generating and utilizing API traffic data. The \\BAC consists of an API Traffic Generator and a BAC Detector.

The field of technology forecasting has long relied on quantitative trend extrapolation techniques, such as growth curves (e.g., Moore's law) and time series models, to project technological progress. To assess the current state of these methods, we conducted an updated systematic literature review (SLR) that incorporates recent advances. This review highlights a growing trend toward machine learning-based hybrid models.\n  Motivated by this review, we developed a forecasting model that combines long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks with an augmentation of Moore's law to predict spacecraft lifetimes. Operational lifetime is an important engineering characteristic of spacecraft and a potential proxy for technological progress in space exploration. Lifetimes were modeled as depending on launch date and additional predictors.\n  Our modeling analysis introduces a novel advance in the recently introduced Start Time End Time Integration (STETI) approach. STETI addresses a critical right censoring problem known to bias lifetime analyses: the more recent the launch dates, the shorter the lifetimes of the spacecraft that have failed and can thus contribute lifetime data. Longer-lived spacecraft are still operating and therefore do not contribute data. This systematically distorts putative lifetime versus launch date curves by biasing lifetime estimates for recent launch dates downward. STETI mitigates this distortion by interconverting between expressing lifetimes as functions of launch time and modeling them as functions of failure time.

While LLMs do not possess a human psychology, they often can emulate human behaviors with sufficiently high fidelity to drive simulations to test human behavioral hypotheses, exhibiting more nuance and range than the rule-based agents often employed in behavioral economics. One key area of interest is the effect of personality on decision making, but the requirement that a prompt must be created for every tested personality profile introduces experimental overhead and degrades replicability. To address this issue, we leverage interpolative decoding, representing each dimension of personality as a pair of opposed prompts and employing an interpolation parameter to simulate behavior along the dimension. We show that interpolative decoding reliably modulates scores along each of the Big Five dimensions. We then show how interpolative decoding causes LLMs to mimic human decision-making behavior in economic games, replicating results from human psychological research.

However, current approaches in using LLMs to automate vulnerability analysis mostly rely on using online API-based LLM services, requiring the user to disclose the source code in development. Moreover, they predominantly frame the task as a binary classification(vulnerable or not vulnerable), limiting potential practical utility. This paper addresses these limitations by reformulating the problem as Software Vulnerability Identification (SVI), where LLMs are asked to output the type of weakness in Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) IDs rather than simply indicating the presence or absence of a vulnerability. We also tackle the reliance on large, API-based LLMs by demonstrating that instruction-tuning smaller, locally deployable LLMs can achieve superior identification performance. In our analysis, instruct-tuning a local LLM showed better overall performance and cost trade-off than online API-based LLMs. Our findings indicate that instruct-tuned local models represent a more effective, secure, and practical approach for leveraging LLMs in real-world vulnerability management workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc774

We propose OpComm, a forecasting and decision-support framework that combines supervised learning with reinforcement learning-based buffer control and a generative AI-driven communication module. A LightGBM regression model generates station-level demand forecasts, which serve as context for a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent that selects buffer levels from a discrete action set. The reward function penalizes under-buffering more heavily than over-buffering, reflecting real-world trade-offs between unmet demand risks and resource inefficiency. Station outcomes are fed back through a Monte Carlo update mechanism, enabling continual policy adaptation. To enhance interpretability, a generative AI layer produces executive-level summaries and scenario analyses grounded in SHAP-based feature attributions. Across 400+ stations, OpComm reduced Weighted Absolute Percentage Error (WAPE) by 21.65% compared to manual forecasts, while lowering under-buffering incidents and improving transparency for decision-makers.

In that sense, depending on its intensity, intra-class variability can hinder the learning process for DL models, specially when such classes are also underrepresented, which is a very common scenario in Fine-Grained Visual Categorization (FGVC) tasks. This paper proposes a novel method that aims at leveraging classification performance in FGVC tasks by learning fine-grained features via classification of class-wise cluster assignments. Our goal is to apply clustering over each class individually, which can allow to discover pseudo-labels that encodes a latent degree of similarity between images. In turn, those labels can be employed in a hierarchical classification process that allows to learn more fine-grained visual features and thereby mitigating intra-class variability issues. Initial experiments over the PlantNet300k enabled to shed light upon several key points in which future work will have to be developed in order to find more conclusive evidence regarding the effectiveness of our method. Our method still achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PlantNet300k dataset even though some of its components haven't been shown to be fully optimized.

However, their increasing accessibility also raises heightened risks of misuse, such as generating harmful or unsafe content. To mitigate these risks, alignment techniques are commonly applied to align model behavior with human values. Despite these efforts, recent studies have shown that jailbreak attacks can circumvent alignment and elicit unsafe outputs. Currently, most existing jailbreak methods are tailored for open-source models and exhibit limited effectiveness against commercial MLLM-integrated systems, which often employ additional filters. These filters can detect and prevent malicious input and output content, significantly reducing jailbreak threats. In this paper, we reveal that the success of these safety filters heavily relies on a critical assumption that malicious content must be explicitly visible in either the input or the output. This assumption, while often valid for traditional LLM-integrated systems, breaks down in MLLM-integrated systems, where attackers can leverage multiple modalities to conceal adversarial intent, leading to a false sense of security in existing MLLM-integrated systems. To challenge this assumption, we propose Odysseus, a novel jailbreak paradigm that introduces dual steganography to covertly embed malicious queries and responses into benign-looking images. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our Odysseus successfully jailbreaks several pioneering and realistic MLLM-integrated systems, achieving up to 99% attack success rate.

However, realizing accurate KWS models on ultra-low-power TinyML devices (often with less than $<2$ MB of flash memory) necessitates a delicate balance between accuracy with strict resource constraints. Multi-objective Bayesian Optimization (MOBO) is an ideal candidate for managing such a trade-off but is highly initialization-dependent, especially under the budgeted black-box setting. Existing methods typically fall back to naive, ad-hoc sampling routines (e.g., Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS), Sobol sequences, or Random search) that are adapted to neither the Pareto front nor undergo rigorous statistical comparison. To address this, we propose Objective-Aware Surrogate Initialization (OASI), a novel initialization strategy that leverages Multi-Objective Simulated Annealing (MOSA) to generate a seed Pareto set of high-performing and diverse configurations that explicitly balance accuracy and model size. Evaluated in a TinyML KWS setting, OASI outperforms LHS, Sobol, and Random initialization, achieving the highest hypervolume (0.0627) and the lowest generational distance (0.0) across multiple runs, with only a modest increase in computation time (1934 s vs. $\\sim$1500 s). A non-parametric statistical analysis using the Kruskal-Wallis test ($H = 5.40$, $p = 0.144$, $\u03b7^2 = 0.0007$) and Dunn's post-hoc test confirms OASI's superior consistency despite the non-significant overall difference with respect to the $\u03b1=0.05$ threshold.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub9ac\uc18c\uc2a4 \uc81c\uc57d\uc774 \uc788\ub294 TinyML \uc7a5\uce58\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud0a4\uc6cc\ub4dc \uc2a4\ud3ec\ud305(KWS) \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub2e4\ubaa9\uc801 \ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654(MOBO)\uc640 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ucd08\uae30\ud654 \uc804\ub7b5\uc778 OASI\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, existing evaluations fail to address this integration, as they are limited to either disembodied social reasoning (e.g., in text) or socially-agnostic physical tasks. Both approaches fail to assess an agent's ability to integrate and trade off both physical and social constraints within a realistic, embodied context. To address this challenge, we introduce Spatially Situated Social Intelligence Test (S$^{3}$IT), a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate embodied social intelligence. It is centered on a novel and challenging seat-ordering task, requiring an agent to arrange seating in a 3D environment for a group of large language model-driven (LLM-driven) NPCs with diverse identities, preferences, and intricate interpersonal relationships. Our procedurally extensible framework generates a vast and diverse scenario space with controllable difficulty, compelling the agent to acquire preferences through active dialogue, perceive the environment via autonomous exploration, and perform multi-objective optimization within a complex constraint network. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on S$^{3}$IT and found that they still struggle with this problem, showing an obvious gap compared with the human baseline. Results imply that LLMs have deficiencies in spatial intelligence, yet simultaneously demonstrate their ability to achieve near human-level competence in resolving conflicts that possess explicit textual cues.", "AI": {"tldr": " embodiment\uc758 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c S$^{3}$IT\ub97c

Accept It. Editor: Imposter Found! Review Rejected", "comment": null, "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are now widely used in writing and reviewing scientific papers. While this trend accelerates publication growth and reduces human workload, it also introduces serious risks. Papers written or reviewed by LLMs may lack real novelty, contain fabricated or biased results, or mislead downstream research that others depend on. Such issues can damage reputations, waste resources, and even endanger lives when flawed studies influence medical or safety-critical systems. This research explores both the offensive and defensive sides of this growing threat. On the attack side, we demonstrate how an author can inject hidden prompts inside a PDF that secretly guide or \"jailbreak\" LLM reviewers into giving overly positive feedback and biased acceptance. On the defense side, we propose an \"inject-and-detect\" strategy for editors, where invisible trigger prompts are embedded into papers; if a review repeats or reacts to these triggers, it reveals that the review was generated by an LLM, not a human. This method turns prompt injections from vulnerability into a verification tool. We outline our design, expected model behaviors, and ethical safeguards for deployment. The goal is to expose how fragile today's peer-review process becomes under LLM influence and how editorial awareness can help restore trust in scientific evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc774 \uacfc\ud559 \ub17c\ubb38 \uc791\uc131 \ubc0f \uac80\ud1a0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uba74\uc11c, \uadf8\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \uc704\ud5d8\ub3c4 \ud568\uaed8 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM\uc758 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc774 \ucd9c\ud310 \uc18d\ub3c4\ub97c \ub192\uc774\uace0 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc5c5\ubb34 \ubd80\ub2f4\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub17c\ubb38\uc758 \uc9c4\uc815\uc131\uacfc \uacb0\uacfc\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc5d0 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "PDF \ub0b4\uc5d0 \uc228\uaca8\uc9c4 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \uc8fc\uc785\ud558\uc5ec LLM \ub9ac\ubdf0\uc5b4\uac00 \ud3b8\ud5a5\ub41c \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\ub294 \uacf5\uaca9 \uae30\ubc95\uacfc, \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc8fc\uc785\ub41c \ud2b8\ub9ac\uac70 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc5ec LLM \ub9ac\ubdf0\ub97c \uac10\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub9ac\ubdf0\uc5b4\uac00 LLM\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc0dd\uc131\ub418\uc5c8\uc74c\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\ub294 \ud2b8\ub9ac\uac70 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub17c\ubb38\uc758 \uac80\ud1a0\uac00 \uc778\uc704\uc801\uc778\uc9c0 \uc5ec\ubd80\ub97c \uac10\uc9c0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "LLM\uc774 \uc624\ub298\ub0a0\uc758 \ub3d9\ub8cc \ud3c9\uac00 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b4\uace0, \ud3b8\uc9d1\uc790\uac00 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub97c \ud68c\ubcf5\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uae30\uc5ec\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "ChatGPT\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \ud604\uc7ac \uacfc\ud559 \ub17c\ubb38 \uc791\uc131 \ubc0f \uac80\ud1a0\uc5d0 \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ucd94\uc138\ub294 \ucd9c\ud310 \uc131\uc7a5\uc744 \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc791\uc5c5 \ubd80\ub2f4\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \uc704\ud5d8\ub3c4 \ucd08\ub798\ud55c\ub2e4.

Record-breaking heat waves, drenching rainfalls, extreme wildfires, and widespread flooding during hurricanes are all becoming more frequent and more intense. Rapid and efficient response to disaster events is essential for climate resilience and sustainability. A key challenge in disaster response is to accurately and quickly identify disaster locations to support decision-making and resources allocation. In this paper, we propose a Probabilistic Cross-view Geolocalization approach, called ProbGLC, exploring new pathways towards generative location awareness for rapid disaster response. Herein, we combine probabilistic and deterministic geolocalization models into a unified framework to simultaneously enhance model explainability (via uncertainty quantification) and achieve state-of-the-art geolocalization performance. Designed for rapid diaster response, the ProbGLC is able to address cross-view geolocalization across multiple disaster events as well as to offer unique features of probabilistic distribution and localizability score. To evaluate the ProbGLC, we conduct extensive experiments on two cross-view disaster datasets (i.e., MultiIAN and SAGAINDisaster), consisting diverse cross-view imagery pairs of multiple disaster types (e.g., hurricanes, wildfires, floods, to tornadoes). Preliminary results confirms the superior geolocalization accuracy (i.e., 0.86 in Acc@1km and 0.97 in Acc@25km) and model explainability (i.e., via probabilistic distributions and localizability scores) of the proposed ProbGLC approach, highlighting the great potential of leveraging generative cross-view approach to facilitate location awareness for better and faster disaster response.

This work introduces Conditional Adversarial Fragility, a regime dependent phenomenon in which adversarial vulnerability is systematically amplified during periods of macroeconomic stress. We propose a regime aware evaluation framework for time indexed tabular financial classification tasks that conditions robustness assessment on external indicators of economic stress. Using volatility based regime segmentation as a proxy for macroeconomic conditions, we evaluate model behavior across calm and stress periods while holding model architecture, attack methodology, and evaluation protocols constant. Baseline predictive performance remains comparable across regimes, indicating that economic stress alone does not induce inherent performance degradation. Under adversarial perturbations, however, models operating during stress regimes exhibit substantially greater degradation across predictive accuracy, operational decision thresholds, and risk sensitive outcomes. We further demonstrate that this amplification propagates to increased false negative rates, elevating the risk of missed high risk cases during adverse conditions. To complement numerical robustness metrics, we introduce an interpretive governance layer based on semantic auditing of model explanations using large language models. Together, these results demonstrate that adversarial robustness in financial machine learning is a regime dependent property and motivate stress aware approaches to model risk assessment in high stakes financial deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uacbd\uc81c\uc801 \uc2a4\ud2b8\ub808\uc2a4 \uae30\uac04 \ub3d9\uc548 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc774

For specific algorithms repeatability with bitwise identical results is also a key for scientific integrity because it allows debugging. We decomposed several very popular clustering algorithms: K-Means, DBSCAN and Ward into their fundamental steps, and we identify the conditions required to achieve repeatability at each stage. We use an implementation example with the Python library scikit-learn to examine the repeatable aspects of each method.

Existing works in financial sentiment analysis have not considered the impact of stock prices or market feedback on sentiment analysis. In this paper, we propose an adaptive framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with real-world stock market feedback to improve sentiment classification in the context of the Indian stock market. The proposed methodology fine-tunes the LLaMA 3.2 3B model using instruction-based learning on the SentiFin dataset. To enhance sentiment predictions, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline is employed that dynamically selects multi-source contextual information based on the cosine similarity of the sentence embeddings. Furthermore, a feedback-driven module is introduced that adjusts the reliability of the source by comparing predicted sentiment with actual next-day stock returns, allowing the system to iteratively adapt to market behavior. To generalize this adaptive mechanism across temporal data, a reinforcement learning agent trained using proximal policy optimization (PPO) is incorporated. The PPO agent learns to optimize source weighting policies based on cumulative reward signals from sentiment-return alignment. Experimental results on NIFTY 50 news headlines collected from 2024 to 2025 demonstrate that the proposed system significantly improves classification accuracy, F1-score, and market alignment over baseline models and static retrieval methods.

The approach estimates Conditional Average Treatment Effects (CATE) with uplift learners and then solves a constrained allocation to decide who to target and which offer to deploy under limits such as budget or acceptable sales deterioration. Applied to retention messaging, event rewards, and spend-threshold assignment, the framework consistently outperforms propensity and static baselines in offline evaluations using uplift AUC, Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS), and Self-Normalized IPS (SNIPS). A production-scale online A/B test further validates strategic lift on revenue and completion while preserving customer-experience constraints.

We frame both tasks as sequential, tool-guided decisions and introduce MolAct, an agentic reinforcement learning framework that employs a two-stage training paradigm: first building editing capability, then optimizing properties while reusing the learned editing behaviors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to formalize molecular design as an Agentic Reinforcement Learning problem, where an LLM agent learns to interleave reasoning, tool-use, and molecular optimization. The framework enables agents to interact in multiple turns, invoking chemical tools for validity checking, property assessment, and similarity control, and leverages their feedback to refine subsequent edits. We instantiate the MolAct framework to train two model families: MolEditAgent for molecular editing tasks and MolOptAgent for molecular optimization tasks. In molecular editing, MolEditAgent-7B delivers 100, 95, and 98 valid add, delete, and substitute edits, outperforming strong closed \"thinking\" baselines such as DeepSeek-R1; MolEditAgent-3B approaches the performance of much larger open \"thinking\" models like Qwen3-32B-think. In molecular optimization, MolOptAgent-7B (trained on MolEditAgent-7B) surpasses the best closed \"thinking\" baseline (e.g., Claude 3.7) on LogP and remains competitive on solubility, while maintaining balanced performance across other objectives. These results highlight that treating molecular design as a multi-step, tool-augmented process is key to reliable and interpretable improvements.", "AI": {"tldr": "MolAct\ub294 \ubd84\uc790 \ud3b8\uc9d1 \ubc0f \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \ub450 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc758 \ud6c8\ub828 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud3b8\uc9d1 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uace0, \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \ud3b8\uc9d1 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubd84\uc790 \ud3b8\uc9d1 \ubc0f \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub294 \ud654\ud559\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\ud6a8\ud558\uace0 \uad6c\uc870\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac1c\uc120\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ubb38\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "MolAct\ub77c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 2\ub2e8\uacc4 \ud6c8\ub828 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud3b8\uc9d1 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud55c \ud6c4 \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \ud3b8\uc9d1 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "MolEditAgent-7B\ub294 \uc720\ud6a8\ud55c \ucd94\uac00, \uc0ad\uc81c, \ub300\uccb4 \ud3b8\uc9d1\uc5d0\uc11c \uac01\uac01 100, 95, 98\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud074\ub85c\uc988\ub4dc '\uc0ac\uace0' \uae30\uc900\uc744 \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\uace0, MolOptAgent-7B\ub294 LogP\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uace0\uc758 \ud074\ub85c\uc988\ub4dc '\uc0ac\uace0' \uae30\uc900\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubd84\uc790 \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4, \ub3c4\uad6c \ubcf4\uac15 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub85c \ub2e4\ub8e8\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uace0 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uac1c\uc120\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc810\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubd84\uc790 \ud3b8\uc9d1 \ubc0f \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub294 \ud654\ud559\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\ud6a8\ud558\uace0 \uad6c\uc870\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac1c\uc120\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ubb38\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub450 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc21c\ucc28\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ub3c4\uad6c-guided \uacb0\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \ud504\ub808\uc784\ud654\ud558\uace0, \ud3b8\uc9d1 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uba3c\uc800 \uad6c\ucd95\ud55c \ud6c4 \ud559\uc2b5\ud55c \ud3b8\uc9d1 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub450 \ub2e8\uacc4 \ud6c8\ub828 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 MolAct\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uac00 \uc544\ub294 \ud55c, \uc774\ub294 \ubd84\uc790 \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ud55c \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c, LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ucd94\ub860, \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9 \ubc0f \ubd84\uc790 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uad50\ucc28 \ud559\uc2b5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ucc28\ub840 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc791\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec, \uc720\ud6a8\uc131 \uac80\uc0ac, \uc18d\uc131 \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc0f \uc720\uc0ac\uc131 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \ud654\ud559 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \ud638\ucd9c\ud558\uace0, \ud6c4\uc18d \ud3b8\uc9d1\uc744 \uc815\uc81c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 MolAct \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uad6c\ud604\ud558\uc5ec \ubd84\uc790 \ud3b8\uc9d1 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c MolEditAgent\uc640 \ubd84\uc790 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c MolOptAgent\uc758 \ub450 \ubaa8\ub378 \uac00\uc871\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubd84\uc790 \ud3b8\uc9d1\uc5d0\uc11c, MolEditAgent-7B\ub294 \uac01\uac01 100, 95, 98\uc758 \uc720\ud6a8\ud55c \ucd94\uac00, \uc0ad\uc81c, \ub300\uccb4 \ud3b8\uc9d1\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, DeepSeek-R1\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud074\ub85c\uc800 '\uc0ac\uace0' \uae30\uc900\uc744 \ucd08\uc6d4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4;

While prompt-based methods excel in few-shot scenarios, their effectiveness often plateaus as more data becomes available. Conversely, fine-tuning scales well with data but may underperform when training examples are scarce. We investigate a unified approach that bridges these two paradigms by incorporating in-context learning directly into the fine-tuning process. Specifically, we fine-tune the model on task-specific data augmented with in-context examples, mimicking the structure of k-shot prompts. This approach, while requiring per-task fine-tuning, combines the sample efficiency of in-context learning with the performance gains of fine-tuning, leading to a method that consistently matches and often significantly exceeds both these baselines. To perform hyperparameter selection in the low-data regime, we propose to use prequential evaluation, which eliminates the need for expensive cross-validation and leverages all available data for training while simultaneously providing a robust validation signal. We conduct an extensive empirical study to determine which adaptation paradigm - fine-tuning, in-context learning, or our proposed unified approach offers the best predictive performance on a concrete data downstream-tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \ud2b9\uc815 \ud558\uc704 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucd94\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\uba70, \uc774 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc791\uc5c5 \ud2b9\uc815 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \ud30c\uc778\ud29c\ub2dd\uc5d0 \uc778\ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc608\uc81c\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ucd94\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ub450 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\ub294 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc5bb\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc800\ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \uc120\ud0dd\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uacbd\ub7c9\ud654\ub41c \uac80\uc99d \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \ud2b9\uc815 \ud558\uc704 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4: (1) \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uace0\uc720\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc778\ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc18c\uc218 \uc0f7 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\ub9c1\uacfc (2) \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uc9c1\uc811 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud2b9\uc815 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc18c\uc218 \uc0f7 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc774 \uc81c\uacf5\ub420\uc218\ub85d \ud6a8\uacfc\uac00 \uc815\uccb4\ub418\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubc18\uba74, \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \uc798 \ud655\uc7a5\ub418\uc9c0\ub9cc \ud6c8\ub828 \uc608\uc81c\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud560 \ub54c\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ub5a8\uc5b4\uc9c8 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0 \uc778\ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc9c1\uc811 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 \ub450 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 k-\uc0f7 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\uc758 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ubaa8\ubc29\ud558\uc5ec \uc778\ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc608\uc81c\ub85c \ubcf4\uac15\ub41c \uc791\uc5c5 \ud2b9\uc815 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc791\uc5c5\ubcc4 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc778\ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ucda9\uc871\ud558\uace0 \uc885\uc885 \ud06c\uac8c \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc800\ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \uc120\ud0dd\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ube44\uc2fc \uad50\ucc28 \uac80\uc99d\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uac70\ud558\uace0 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uac80\uc99d \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5b4\ub5a4 \uc801\uc751 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784 -

The key challenge lies in tokenizing TS data into textual representations that align with LLMs' pre-trained knowledge. While existing work often relies on fine-tuning specialized modules to bridge this gap, a distinct, yet challenging, paradigm aims to leverage truly off-the-shelf LLMs without any fine-tuning whatsoever, relying solely on strategic tokenization of numerical sequences. The performance of these fully frozen models is acutely sensitive to the textual representation of the input data, as their parameters cannot adapt to distribution shifts. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet highly effective strategy to overcome this brittleness: injecting noise into the raw time series before tokenization. This non-invasive intervention acts as a form of inference-time augmentation, compelling the frozen LLM to extrapolate based on robust underlying temporal patterns rather than superficial numerical artifacts. We theoretically analyze this phenomenon and empirically validate its effectiveness across diverse benchmarks. Notably, to fully eliminate potential biases from data contamination during LLM pre-training, we introduce two novel TS datasets that fall outside all utilized LLMs' pre-training scopes, and consistently observe improved performance. This study provides a further step in directly leveraging off-the-shelf LLMs for time series forecasting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815 \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 LLM\uacfc\uc758 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uc18c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc804\ubb38 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc744 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801\uc778 \ud1a0\ud070\ud654\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6d0\uc2dc \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4\uc5d0 \ub178\uc774\uc988\ub97c \uc8fc\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \ud1a0\ud070\ud654 \uc804\uc5d0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ubcc0\ud654\uc2dc\ucf1c, LLM\uc774 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \uc22b\uc790 \uc544\ud2f0\ud329\ud2b8\uac00 \uc544\ub2cc \ub354 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc2dc\uac04 \ud328\ud134\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud574 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc720\ub3c4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc2e4\uc99d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\uc99d\ud588\uc73c\uba70, LLM\uc758 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815 \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub41c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uad00\ucc30\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uae30\uc131 LLM \ud65c\uc6a9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud55c \ub2e8\uacc4 \ub354 \ub098\uc544\uac04 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4(TS) \uc608\uce21\uc790\ub85c\uc11c\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc8fc\uc694 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub294 LLM\uc758 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucd94\uc5b4 TS \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud615\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \ud1a0\ud070\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \uc791\uc5c5\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uc774 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uc18c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc804\ubb38 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc744 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub3c5\ud2b9\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc778 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc740 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \uc22b\uc790 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4 \ud1a0\ud070\ud654\uc5d0\ub9cc \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc9c4\uc815\ud55c \uae30\uc131 LLM\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc644\uc804 \uace0\uc815 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc740 \uc785\ub825 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud45c\ud604\uc5d0 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ubbfc\uac10\ud558\uba70, \uadf8\ub4e4\uc758 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub294 \ubd84\ud3ec \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774\ub7f0 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc804\uc774 \uc804 \ub178\uc774\uc988\ub97c \uc6d0\uc2dc \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4\uc5d0 \uc8fc\uc785\ud558\ub294 \uac04\ub2e8\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ube44\uce68\uc2b5\uc801 \uac1c\uc785\uc740 \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc99d\uac15\uc758 \ud615\ud0dc\ub85c \uc791\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uace0\uc815\ub41c LLM\uc774 \ud53c\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \uc22b\uc790 \uc544\ud2f0\ud329\ud2b8\uac00 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uae30\ubcf8 \uc2dc\uac04 \ud328\ud134\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uc5ec \uc678\uc0bd\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uac15\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uadf8 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc2e4\uc99d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788, LLM\uc758 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub3d9\uc548 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc624\uc5fc\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \uc644\uc804\ud788 \uc81c\uac70\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub41c \ubaa8\ub4e0 LLM\uc758 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubc94\uc704\ub97c \ubc97\uc5b4\ub09c \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 TS \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub41c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uad00\ucc30\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uae30\uc131 LLM\uc744 \uc9c1\uc811 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\uc5b4 \ud55c \ub2e8\uacc4 \ub354 \ub098\uc544\uac04 \uc811\uadfc\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Standard RLVR paradigms, utilizing binary reward signals, inadvertently incentivize models as good test-takers rather than honest communicators, encouraging guessing whenever correctness probability exceeds zero. This paper presents an exhaustive investigation into behavioral calibration, which incentivizes models to stochastically admit uncertainty by abstaining when not confident, aligning model behavior with accuracy. Synthesizing recent advances, we propose and evaluate training interventions optimizing strictly proper scoring rules for models to output a calibrated probability of correctness. Our methods enable models to either abstain from producing a complete response or flag individual claims where uncertainty remains. Utilizing Qwen3-4B-Instruct, empirical analysis reveals behavior-calibrated reinforcement learning allows smaller models to surpass frontier models in uncertainty quantification--a transferable meta-skill decouplable from raw predictive accuracy. Trained on math reasoning tasks, our model's log-scale Accuracy-to-Hallucination Ratio gain (0.806) exceeds GPT-5's (0.207) in a challenging in-domain evaluation (BeyondAIME). Moreover, in cross-domain factual QA (SimpleQA), our 4B LLM achieves zero-shot calibration error on par with frontier models including Grok-4 and Gemini-2.5-Pro, even though its factual accuracy is much lower.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud589\ub3d9 \ubcf4\uc815\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucca0\uc800\ud55c \uc870\uc0ac\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uc778\uc815\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4 \ub354 \uc791\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ub2a5\uac00\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM\uc758 \ubc30\uce58\uac00 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ud658\uac01 \ud604\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ubc29\ud574\ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uae30\uc874\uc758 RLVR \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc815\uc9c1\ud55c \uc758\uc0ac\uc18c\ud1b5\uc790\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc2dc\ud5d8\uc744 \uc798 \uce58\ub974\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud589\ub3d9 \ubcf4\uc815\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ucca0\uc800\ud55c \uc870\uc0ac\uc640 \ud6c8\ub828 \uac1c\uc785\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \ud655\ub960\uc744 \ucd9c\ub825\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "Qwen3-4B-Instruct\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud589\ub3d9 \ubcf4\uc815\ub41c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc774 \uc791\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ucd08\uc6d4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc218\ud559\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub192\uc740 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5b4, \ub2e4\ub978 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc911\uc694\ud55c \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c LLM \ubc30\uce58\ub294 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ud658\uac01, \uc989 \uadf8\ub7f4\ub4ef\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc0ac\uc2e4\uc0c1 \ubd80\uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc8fc\uc7a5\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc800\ud574\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1 \ubc95\uce59\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ub2a5\ub825\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \uac00\uc838\uc654\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ud658\uac01\uc774 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uc624\ub958\uac00 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\ud3ec \ubaa8\ubc29\uc744 \uc6b0\uc120\uc2dc\ud558\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc758 \uc608\uce21 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \uacb0\uacfc\ub77c\uace0 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc790\uc2e0\uac10\uc774 \uc5c6\uc744 \ub54c \uc790\uc81c\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\uc5ec \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uc778\uc2dd\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \ud589\ub3d9 \ubcf4\uc815\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucca0\uc800\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \uc885\ud569\ud558\uc5ec, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc5d0 \ub9de\ub294 \ubcf4\uc815\ub41c \ud655\ub960\uc744 \ucd9c\ub825\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc5c4\uaca9\ud788 \uc801\uc808\ud55c \uc2a4\ucf54\uc5b4\ub9c1 \uaddc\uce59\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828 \uac1c\uc785\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0 \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc644\uc804\ud55c \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uac70\ub098 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc774 \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\ub294 \uac1c\ubcc4 \uc8fc\uc7a5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uacbd\uace0\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4.

However, ensuring safety remains a critical challenge across many domains and tasks. Previous works on safe RL from human feedback (RLHF) first learn reward and cost models from offline data, then use constrained RL to optimize a safe policy. While such an approach works in the contextual bandits settings (LLMs), in long horizon continuous control tasks, errors in rewards and costs accumulate, leading to impairment in performance when used with constrained RL methods. To address these challenges, (a) instead of indirectly learning policies (from rewards and costs), we introduce a framework that learns a policy directly based on pairwise preferences regarding the agent's behavior in terms of rewards, as well as binary labels indicating the safety of trajectory segments; (b) we propose \\textsc{PreSa} (Preference and Safety Alignment), a method that combines preference learning module with safety alignment in a constrained optimization problem. This optimization problem is solved within a Lagrangian paradigm that directly learns reward-maximizing safe policy \\textit{without explicitly learning reward and cost models}, avoiding the need for constrained RL; (c) we evaluate our approach on continuous control tasks with both synthetic and real human feedback. Empirically, our method successfully learns safe policies with high rewards, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines, and offline safe RL approaches with ground-truth reward and cost.", "AI":

Addressing these with simulations is hindered by their massive scale, both in synthetic data volumes and numerical complexity, while real-data efforts are constrained by models that inadequately reflect the Earth's complexity and by sparse sensor measurements from the field. Recent machine learning (ML) efforts offer promise, but progress is obscured by a lack of proper characterization, fair reporting, and rigorous comparisons. To address this, we introduce a Common Task Framework (CTF) for ML for seismic wavefields, starting with three distinct wavefield datasets. Our CTF features a curated set of datasets at various scales (global, crustal, and local) and task-specific metrics spanning forecasting, reconstruction, and generalization under realistic constraints such as noise and limited data. Inspired by CTFs in fields like natural language processing, this framework provides a structured and rigorous foundation for head-to-head algorithm evaluation. We illustrate the evaluation procedure with scores reported for two of the datasets, showcasing the performance of various methods and foundation models for reconstructing seismic wavefields from both simulated and real-world sensor measurements. The CTF scores reveal the strengths, limitations, and suitability for specific problem classes. Our vision is to replace ad hoc comparisons with standardized evaluations on hidden test sets, raising the bar for rigor and reproducibility in scientific ML.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc9c0\uc9c4\ud559\uc740 \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc608\uce21 \ubc0f \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc9c0\uc9c4\ud559\uc758 \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc608\uce21\uacfc \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\uc740 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uadf8 \ud574\uacb0\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc778\ud504\ub77c\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uacf5\ud1b5 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c(CTF)\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uba70, \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0\uc758 \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \ud30c\ub3d9 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc \uae30\ubcf8 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc5ec \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ud45c\uc900\ud654\ub41c \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ucca0\uc800\ud568\uacfc \uc7ac\ud604\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc9c0\uc9c4\ud559\uc740 \uc9c0\uc9c4 \uc870\uae30 \uacbd\uace0 \ubc0f \uc9c0\ubc18 \uc6c0\uc9c1\uc784 \uc608\uce21\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc608\uce21 \ubc0f \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc6d0\ucc9c \uc704\uce58, \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998 \ubc0f \uc9c0\uad6c \ubaa8\ub378(\uc608: \uc9c0\ud558 \uad6c\uc870 \ubc0f \uc9c0\ud615 \ud6a8\uacfc)\uc758 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc744 \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ub370\ub294 \ubc29\ub300\ud55c \uaddc\ubaa8\uc758 \ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc591\uacfc \uc218\uce58\uc801 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc774 \uc7a5\uc560\ubb3c\uc774 \ub418\uace0, \uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c \uc791\uc5c5\ud560 \ub54c\ub294 \uc9c0\uad6c\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \ubc18\uc601\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ud604\uc7a5\uc758 \ud76c\uc18c\ud55c \uc13c\uc11c \uce21\uc815\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ubc1b\ub294\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc\uc758 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5(ML) \ub178\ub825\uc740 \ud76c\ub9dd\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc801\uc808\ud55c \ud2b9\uc131\ud654, \uacf5\uc815\ud55c \ubcf4\uace0 \ubc0f \ucca0\uc800\ud55c \ube44\uad50\uc758 \uacb0\uc5ec\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc9c4\uc804\uc774 \uac00\ub85c\ub9c9\ud788\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0\uc758 \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \ud30c\ub3d9 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \uc2dc\uc791\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c0\uc9c4\ud30c\uc7a5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c ML\uc758 \uacf5\ud1b5 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c(CTF)\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 CTF\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uaddc\ubaa8(\uc804\uad6d\uc801, \uc9c0\uac01, \uc9c0\uc5ed)\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc640 \ub178\uc774\uc988 \ubc0f \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \uc81c\uc57d \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc608\uce21, \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131 \ubc0f \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \uacfc\uc81c\ubcc4 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc758 \ud050\ub808\uc774\uc158\ub41c \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \ucc98\ub9ac\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 CTF\uc5d0 \uc790\uadf9\uc744 \ubc1b\uc544 \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc11c\ub85c \uac04\uc758 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ucca0\uc800\ud55c \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc810\uc218\ub97c \ubcf4\uace0\ud558\uc5ec \ud3c9\uac00 \uc808\ucc28\ub97c \uc124\uba85\ud558\uace0, \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ubc0f \uc2e4\uc81c \uc13c\uc11c \uce21\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c0\uc9c4\ud30c\uc7a5\uc744 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc \uae30\ubcf8 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.

Embodied intelligence focuses on training agents within realistic simulated environments, leveraging physical interaction and action feedback rather than conventionally labeled datasets. Yet, most existing simulation platforms remain narrowly designed, each tailored to specific tasks. A versatile, general-purpose training environment that can support everything from low-level embodied navigation to high-level composite activities, such as multi-agent social simulation and human-AI collaboration, remains largely unavailable. To bridge this gap, we introduce TongSIM, a high-fidelity, general-purpose platform for training and evaluating embodied agents.

However, many deployed memory systems primarily optimize compression and storage, with comparatively less emphasis on explicit, closed-loop control of memory retrieval. From this observation, we build memory retrieval as an autonomous, accurate, and compatible agent system, named MemR$^3$, which has two core mechanisms: 1) a router that selects among retrieve, reflect, and answer actions to optimize answer quality; 2) a global evidence-gap tracker that explicitly renders the answering process transparent and tracks the evidence collection process. This design departs from the standard retrieve-then-answer pipeline by introducing a closed-loop control mechanism that enables autonomous decision-making. Empirical results on the LoCoMo benchmark demonstrate that MemR$^3$ surpasses strong baselines on LLM-as-a-Judge score, and particularly, it improves existing retrievers across four categories with an overall improvement on RAG (+7.29%) and Zep (+1.94%) using GPT-4.1-mini backend, offering a plug-and-play controller for existing memory stores.", "AI": {"tldr": "MemR$^3$\ub294 \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc815\ud655\ud558\uba70 \ud638\ud658 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uac80\uc0c9 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc73c\ub85c, \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uac80\uc0c9\uc758 \ud3d0\uc1c4 \ub8e8\ud504 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \ub2f5\ubcc0 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc555\ucd95 \ubc0f \uc800\uc7a5 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc5d0 \uce58\uc911\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uac80\uc0c9\uc758 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801 \uc81c\uc5b4\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud568\uc744 \uad00\ucc30\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "method": "MemR$^3$\ub294 \uac80\uc0c9, \ubc18\uc601 \ubc0f \uc751\ub2f5 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\ub294 \ub77c\uc6b0\ud130\uc640 \ub2f5\ubcc0 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uba85\ud655\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uba70 \uc99d\uac70 \uc218\uc9d1\uc744 \ucd94\uc801\ud558\ub294 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uc99d\uac70 \uaca9\ucc28 \ucd94\uc801\uae30\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud575\uc2ec \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c\ub2e4.", "result": "LoCoMo \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, MemR$^3$\ub294 LLM-as-a-Judge \uc810\uc218\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\uba70, \ud2b9\ud788 RAG\uc5d0\uc11c 7.29%, Zep\uc5d0\uc11c 1.94%\uc758 \uc804\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "MemR$^3$\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc800\uc7a5\uc18c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud50c\ub7ec\uadf8 \uc564 \ud50c\ub808\uc774 \ucee8\ud2b8\ub864\ub7ec\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uacfc\uac70 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc124\uacc4\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \ubc30\ud3ec\ub41c \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc8fc\ub85c \uc555\ucd95 \ubc0f \uc800\uc7a5\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc810\uc744 \ub450\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uac80\uc0c9\uc758 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801 \ud3d0\uc1c4 \ub8e8\ud504 \uc81c\uc5b4\uc5d0\ub294 \uc0c1\ub300\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub35c \uac15\uc870\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uad00\ucc30\uc744 \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uac80\uc0c9\uc744 \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc815\ud655\ud558\uba70 \ud638\ud658 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc778 MemR$^3$\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc751\ub2f5 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uac80\uc0c9, \ubc18\uc601 \ubc0f \uc751\ub2f5 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc911\uc5d0\uc11c \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\ub294 \ub77c\uc6b0\ud130\uc640 \uc751\ub2f5 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uba85\ud655\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uace0 \uc99d\uac70 \uc218\uc9d1 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ucd94\uc801\ud558\ub294 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uc99d\uac70 \uaca9\ucc28 \ucd94\uc801\uae30\uc758 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud575\uc2ec \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc124\uacc4\ub294 \uc790\uc728\uc801 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \ud3d0\uc1c4 \ub8e8\ud504 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ud45c\uc900 \uac80\uc0c9-\ud6c4-\uc751\ub2f5 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc97\uc5b4\ub0a9\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Loxley"], "title": "An Optimal Policy for Learning Controllable Dynamics by Exploration", "comment": null, "summary": "Controllable Markov chains describe the dynamics of sequential decision making tasks and are the central component in optimal control and reinforcement learning. In this work, we give the general form of an optimal policy for learning controllable dynamics in an unknown environment by exploring over a limited time horizon. This policy is simple to implement and efficient to compute, and allows an agent to ``learn by exploring\" as it maximizes its information gain in a greedy fashion by selecting controls from a constraint set that changes over time during exploration. We give a simple parameterization for the set of controls, and present an algorithm for finding an optimal policy. The reason for this policy is due to the existence of certain types of states that restrict control of the dynamics; such as transient states, absorbing states, and non-backtracking states. We show why the occurrence of these states makes a non-stationary policy essential for achieving optimal exploration. Six interesting examples of controllable dynamics are treated in detail. Policy optimality is demonstrated using counting arguments, comparing with suboptimal policies, and by making use of a sequential improvement property from dynamic programming.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc54c\ub824\uc9c0\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\uc5b4 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ucd5c\uc801 \uc815\ucc45\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18 \ud615\ud0dc\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \uc774 \uc815\ucc45\uc740 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc774\ub4dd\uc744 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc81c\uc5b4 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uc5f0\uc1c4\ub294 \uc5f0\uc18d \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud558\uace0 \ucd5c\uc801 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ubc0f \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec \uc694\uc18c\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc2dc\uac04 \uc218\ud3c9\uc120\uc5d0\uc11c \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\uc5ec \ucd5c\uc801 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ucc3e\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774 \uc815\ucc45\uc740 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc720\ud615\uc758 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uac00 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559 \ud1b5\uc81c\ub97c \uc81c\ud55c\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uc5d0 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uba70, \uc5ec\uc12f \uac00\uc9c0 \ud765\ubbf8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc758 \uc608\uac00 \uc790\uc138\ud788 \ub2e4\ub904\uc9c4\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc815\ucc45 \ucd5c\uc801\uc131\uc744 \ub3d9\uc801 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d\uc758 \uc21c\ucc28\uc801 \uac1c\uc120 \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc11c\ube0c \ucd5c\uc801 \uc815\ucc45\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud558\uba70 \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc81c\uc5b4 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uccb4\uc778\uc740 \uc5f0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud558\uba70, \ucd5c\uc801 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ubc0f \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc54c\ub824\uc9c0\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc2dc\uac04 \uc218\ud3c9\uc120 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\uc5b4 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ucd5c\uc801 \uc815\ucc45\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18 \ud615\ud0dc\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc815\ucc45\uc740 \uad6c\ud604\uc774 \uac04\ub2e8\ud558\uace0 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uba70, \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\ub294 \ub3d9\uc548 \uc2dc\uac04\uc774 \uc9c0\ub0a8\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ubcc0\ud558\ub294 \uc81c\uc57d \uc9d1\ud569\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\uc5b4\ub97c \uc120\ud0dd\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc774\ub4dd\uc744 \ud0d0\uc695\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud558\ub294 \"\ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \ud559\uc2b5\"\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc9d1\ud569\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0 \ucd5c\uc801 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ucc3e\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc815\ucc45\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc740 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc758 \ud1b5\uc81c\ub97c \uc81c\ud55c\ud558\ub294 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc720\ud615\uc758 \uc0c1\ud0dc, \uc989 \uc77c\uc2dc \uc0c1\ud0dc, \ud761\uc218 \uc0c1\ud0dc \ubc0f \ube44\uc5ed\ud589 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc758 \uc874\uc7ac \ub54c\ubb38\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc758 \ubc1c\uc0dd\uc774 \ucd5c\uc801 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1 \uc815\ucc45\uc774 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc778 \uc774\uc720\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5ec\uc12f \uac00\uc9c0 \ud765\ubbf8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc758 \uc608\uc2dc\ub97c \uc790\uc138\ud788 \ub2e4\ub8f9\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc815\ucc45\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801\uc131\uc740 \uce74\uc6b4\ud305 \uc8fc\uc7a5\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc11c\ube0c \ucd5c\uc801 \uc815\ucc45\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud558\uace0 \ub3d9\uc801 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d\uc758 \uc21c\ucc28\uc801 \uac1c\uc120 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Although Large Language Model (LLM) agents offer a path toward intent-based networking, they introduce stochastic risks, including topology hallucinations and policy non-compliance. To mitigate this, we propose Graph-Symbolic Policy Enforcement and Control (G-SPEC), a neuro-symbolic framework that constrains probabilistic planning with deterministic verification. The architecture relies on a Governance Triad - a telecom-adapted agent (TSLAM-4B), a Network Knowledge Graph (NKG), and SHACL constraints. We evaluated G-SPEC on a simulated 450-node 5G Core, achieving zero safety violations and a 94.1% remediation success rate, significantly outperforming the 82.4% baseline. Ablation analysis indicates that NKG validation drives the majority of safety gains (68%), followed by SHACL policies (24%). Scalability tests on topologies ranging from 10K to 100K nodes demonstrate that validation latency scales as $O(k^{1.2})$ where $k$ is subgraph size.

In contrast, many real-world systems including maritime traffic lack such fixed anchors, making the construction of spatio-temporal graphs a fundamental challenge. Anomaly detection in these non-grid environments is particularly difficult due to the absence of canonical reference points, the sparsity and irregularity of trajectories, and the fact that anomalies may manifest at multiple granularities. In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark dataset for anomaly detection in the maritime domain, extending the Open Maritime Traffic Analysis Dataset (OMTAD) into a benchmark tailored for graph-based anomaly detection. Our dataset enables systematic evaluation across three different granularities: node-level, edge-level, and graph-level anomalies. We plan to employ two specialized LLM-based agents: \\emph{Trajectory Synthesizer} and \\emph{Anomaly Injector} to construct richer interaction contexts and generate semantically meaningful anomalies.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) have significantly improved natural language interaction with such structured data, they often fall short in handling the complex, multi-step reasoning and robust code execution required for real-world table tasks. Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising avenue to enhance these capabilities, yet its application in the tabular domain faces three critical hurdles: the scarcity of high-quality agentic trajectories with closed-loop code execution and environment feedback on diverse table structures, the extreme heterogeneity of feedback signals ranging from rigid SQL execution to open-ended data interpretation, and the risk of catastrophic forgetting of general knowledge during vertical specialization. To overcome these challenges and unlock advanced reasoning on complex tables, we introduce \\textbf{TableGPT-R1}, a specialized tabular model built on a systematic RL framework. Our approach integrates a comprehensive data engineering pipeline that synthesizes difficulty-stratified agentic trajectories for both supervised alignment and RL rollouts, a task-adaptive reward system that combines rule-based verification with a criteria-injected reward model and incorporates process-level step reward shaping with behavioral regularization, and a multi-stage training framework that progressively stabilizes reasoning before specializing in table-specific tasks. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that TableGPT-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on authoritative benchmarks, significantly outperforming baseline models while retaining robust general capabilities.

Current solutions, such as post-hoc filtering or projection-based methods, often compromise structural novelty or disrupt key pharmacophores by forcing molecules into pre-defined synthetic templates. Herein, we introduce SynCraft, a reasoning-based framework that reframes synthesizability optimization not as a sequence translation task, but as a precise structural editing problem. Leveraging the emergent reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models, SynCraft navigates the \"synthesis cliff\" where minimal structural modifications yield significant gains in synthetic feasibility. By predicting executable sequences of atom-level edits rather than generating SMILES strings directly, SynCraft circumvents the syntactic fragility of LLMs while harnessing their chemical intuition. Extensive benchmarks demonstrate that SynCraft outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in generating synthesizable analogs with high structural fidelity. Furthermore, through interaction-aware prompting, SynCraft successfully replicates expert medicinal chemistry intuition in editing PLK1 inhibitors and rescuing high-scoring but previously discarded RIPK1 candidates in previous molecular generation literatures.", "AI": {"tldr": "Generative AI\ub294 \ud654\ud559 \uacf5\uac04 \ud0d0\uc0ac\uc5d0 \ud601\uc2e0\uc744 \uac00\uc838\uc654\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \ubd84\uc790\uc758 \uc0c1\ub2f9 \ubd80\ubd84\uc774 \ud569\uc131 \uc811\uadfc\uc774 \ubd88\uac00\ub2a5\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc9c0\ub2c8\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc740 \uad6c\uc870\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6c0\uc744 \uc800\ud574\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc57d\ubb3c \uc791\uc6a9\uc810\uc744 \ubc29\ud574\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 SynCraft\ub77c\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ud569\uc131 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4 \ubcc0\ud658 \uc791\uc5c5\uc774 \uc544\ub2cc \uad6c\uc870 \ud3b8\uc9d1 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.

Rather than relying exclusively on empirical data or predefined equations, this methodology embeds domain knowledge directly into the learning process, resulting in models that are both more accurate and robust. We leverage this paradigm to accelerate simulations of the Zero Degree Calorimeter (ZDC) of the ALICE experiment at CERN. Our method introduces a novel loss function and an output variability-based scaling mechanism, which enhance the model's capability to accurately represent the spatial distribution and morphology of particle showers in detector outputs while mitigating the influence of rare artefacts on the training. Leveraging Normalizing Flows (NFs) in a teacher-student generative framework, we demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms classic data-driven model assimilation but also yields models that are 421 times faster than existing NF implementations in ZDC simulation literature.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubb3c\ub9ac \uae30\ubc18 \uba38\uc2e0\ub7ec\ub2dd\uc740 \uc804\ud1b5 \uacfc\ud559\uacfc \ud604\ub300 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc8fc\ub3c4 \uae30\uc220\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ub354 \uc815\ud655\ud558\uace0 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "ALICE \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc758 \uc81c\ub85c\ub3c4 \uce7c\ub85c\ub9ac\ubbf8\ud130(ZDC) \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubb3c\ub9ac \uae30\ubc18 \uba38\uc2e0\ub7ec\ub2dd \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc190\uc2e4 \ud568\uc218\uc640 \ucd9c\ub825 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131 \uae30\ubc18 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc785\uc790 \uc0e4\uc6cc\uc758 \uacf5\uac04 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc640 \ud615\ud0dc\ub97c \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0bc \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uace0\uc804\uc801\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ub4dc\ub9ac\ube10 \ubaa8\ub378 \ub3d9\ud654\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud558\uba70 ZDC \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ubb38\ud5cc\uc758 \uae30\uc874 NF \uad6c\ud604\ubcf4\ub2e4 421\ubc30 \ube60\ub978 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \ud2b9\uc815 \ub9ac\uc18c\uc2a4\ub97c \uc808\uc57d\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubb3c\ub9ac \uae30\ubc18 \uba38\uc2e0\ub7ec\ub2dd\uc740 \uc804\ud1b5 \uacfc\ud559\uacfc \ud604\ub300 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc740 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub098 \ubbf8\ub9ac \uc815\uc758\ub41c \ubc29\uc815\uc2dd\uc5d0\ub9cc \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294 \ub300\uc2e0, \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3ec\ud568\uc2dc\ucf1c \ub354\uc6b1 \uc815\ud655\ud558\uace0 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ub9cc\ub4ed\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec CERN\uc758 ALICE \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\ub85c\ub3c4 \uce7c\ub85c\ub9ac\ubbf8\ud130(ZDC) \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc190\uc2e4 \ud568\uc218\uc640 \ucd9c\ub825 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131 \uae30\ubc18 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uae30 \ucd9c\ub825\uc5d0\uc11c \uc785\uc790 \uc0e4\uc6cc\uc758 \uacf5\uac04 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc640 \ud615\ud0dc\ub97c \uc815\ud655\ud788 \ud45c\ud604\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\uba70, \ud6c8\ub828\uc5d0 \uc788\ub294 \ub4dc\ubb38 \uc778\uacf5\ubb3c\uc758 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc904\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad50\uc0ac-\ud559\uc0dd \uc0dd\uc131 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \ud750\ub984(NFs)\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \uae30\uc874 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378 \ub3d9\ud654\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub0a0 \ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c ZDC \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ubb38\ud5cc\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 NF \uad6c\ud604\ubcf4\ub2e4 421\ubc30 \ube60\ub978 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud568\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

This shift is increasingly feasible, as scientific tools and models can be invoked through stable interfaces and verified with recorded execution traces, and increasingly necessary, as AI accelerates scientific output and stresses the peer-review and publication pipeline, raising the bar for traceability and credible evaluation.\n  However, scaling agentic science remains difficult: workflows are hard to observe and reproduce; many tools and laboratory systems are not agent-ready; execution is hard to trace and govern; and prototype AI Scientist systems are often bespoke, limiting reuse and systematic improvement from real workflow signals.\n  We argue that scaling agentic science requires an infrastructure-and-ecosystem approach, instantiated in Bohrium+SciMaster. Bohrium acts as a managed, traceable hub for AI4S assets -- akin to a HuggingFace of AI for Science -- that turns diverse scientific data, software, compute, and laboratory systems into agent-ready capabilities. SciMaster orchestrates these capabilities into long-horizon scientific workflows, on which scientific agents can be composed and executed. Between infrastructure and orchestration, a \\emph{scientific intelligence substrate} organizes reusable models, knowledge, and components into executable building blocks for workflow reasoning and action, enabling composition, auditability, and improvement through use.\n  We demonstrate this stack with eleven representative master agents in real workflows, achieving orders-of-magnitude reductions in end-to-end scientific cycle time and generating execution-grounded signals from real workloads at multi-million scale.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ub3c4\uad6c

The game runs in the direction opposite to that of the network, and the input of the network serves as the terminal reward of the game. In fact, evaluating the network is the same as running the Shapley-Bellman backward recursion for the value of the game. Using the expression of the value of the game as an expected total payoff with respect to the path measure induced by the transition probabilities and a pair of optimal policies, we derive a discrete Feynman-Kac-type path-integral formula for the network output. This game-theoretic representation can be used to derive bounds on the output from bounds on the input, leveraging the monotonicity of Shapley operators, and to verify robustness properties using policies as certificates. Moreover, training the neural network becomes an inverse game problem: given pairs of terminal rewards and corresponding values, one seeks transition probabilities and rewards of a game that reproduces them. Finally, we show that a similar approach applies to neural networks with Softplus activation functions, where the ReLU net game is replaced by its entropic regularization.", "AI": {"tldr": "ReLU \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc758 \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\ub85c\uc12c \ud134\uc81c \uc815\uc9c0 \uac8c\uc784\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uc11d\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ucd9c\ub825\uc758 \uacbd\ub85c \uc801\ubd84 \uacf5\uc2dd\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uace0 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uc5ed\uac8c\uc784 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc804\ud658\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \ucd9c\ub825\uc758 \ud574\uc11d \ubc0f \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ud6c8\ub828\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud568\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "ReLU \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc758 \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\ub85c\uc12c \uac8c\uc784\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uc11d\ud558\uace0, \uc0e4\ud50c\ub9ac-\ubca8\ub9cc \uc5ed\uc7ac\uadc0\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac8c\uc784\uc758 \uac00\uce58\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uacbd\ub85c \uc801\ubd84 \uacf5\uc2dd\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "ReLU \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uc5ed\uac8c\uc784 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uc0ac\uc2e4\uacfc Softplus \ud65c\uc131\ud654 \ud568\uc218\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uac8c\uc784 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ud45c\ud604\uc740 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc758 \ucd9c\ub825\uacfc \uc785\ub825 \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uace0 \uac15\uac74\uc131 \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc720\uc6a9\ud558\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 ReLU \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc758 \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\ub85c\uc12c \ud134\uc81c \uc815\uc9c0 \uac8c\uc784\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uc11d\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \uc774 \uac8c\uc784\uc740 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc640 \ubc18\ub300 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c4\ud589\ub418\uba70, \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \uc785\ub825\uc774 \uac8c\uc784\uc758 \ucd5c\uc885 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc2e4\uc81c\ub85c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uac8c\uc784 \uac00\uce58\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0e4\ud50c\ub9ac-\ubca8\ub9cc \uc5ed\uc7ac\uadc0\ub97c \uc2e4\ud589\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uacfc \uac19\ub2e4. \uc804\uc774 \ud655\ub960\uacfc \uc30d\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801 \uc815\ucc45\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc720\ub3c4\ub41c \uacbd\ub85c \uce21\uc815\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc608\uc0c1 \ucd1d \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c\uc11c \uac8c\uc784\uc758 \uac00\uce58\ub97c \ud45c\ud604\ud558\uc5ec, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc774\uc0b0 \ud30c\uc778\ub9cc-\uce74\ud06c\ud615 \uacbd\ub85c \uc801\ubd84 \uacf5\uc2dd\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uac8c\uc784 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ud45c\ud604\uc740 \uc0e4\ud50c\ub9ac \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc790\uc758 \ub2e8\uc870\uc131\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc785\ub825 \uacbd\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd9c\ub825 \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uace0 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\uc11c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac15\uac74\uc131 \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \ub354\ubd88\uc5b4 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \ud6c8\ub828\uc740 \uc8fc\uc5b4\uc9c4 \ucd5c\uc885 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubc0f \ud574\ub2f9 \uac12\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\uc774 \ud655\ub960\uacfc \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \ucc3e\ub294 \uc5ed\uac8c\uc784 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ub41c\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Softplus \ud65c\uc131\ud654 \ud568\uc218\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc5d0 \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc774 \uc801\uc6a9\ub428\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uc774 \uacbd\uc6b0 ReLU \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \uac8c\uc784\uc740 \uadf8 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \uc815\uaddc\ud654\ub85c \ub300\uccb4\ub41c\ub2e4."}}

We tested whether chain-of-thought reasoning improves agentic planning in a retrospective cohort of 41 patients with brain metastases treated with 18 Gy single-fraction SRS. We developed SAGE (Secure Agent for Generative Dose Expertise), an LLM-based planning agent for automated SRS treatment planning. Two variants generated plans for each case: one using a non-reasoning model, one using a reasoning model. The reasoning variant showed comparable plan dosimetry relative to human planners on primary endpoints (PTV coverage, maximum dose, conformity index, gradient index; all p > 0.21) while reducing cochlear dose below human baselines (p = 0.022). When prompted to improve conformity, the reasoning model demonstrated systematic planning behaviors including prospective constraint verification (457 instances) and trade-off deliberation (609 instances), while the standard model exhibited none of these deliberative processes (0 and 7 instances, respectively). Content analysis revealed that constraint verification and causal explanation concentrated in the reasoning agent. The optimization traces serve as auditable logs, offering a path toward transparent automated planning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub1cc \uc804\uc774
