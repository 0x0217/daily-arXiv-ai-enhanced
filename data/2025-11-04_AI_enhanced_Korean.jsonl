However, current trading agents primarily focus on single-step trading\ntasks and lack awareness of continuous position management. Therefore, we\npropose a position-aware trading task designed to simulate a more realistic\nmarket. To address this task, we develop a trading agent system, FinPos,\noptimized for position management. FinPos is able to interpret various types of\nmarket information from a professional perspective, providing a reliable basis\nfor positioning decisions. To mitigate the substantial market risks arising\nfrom position fluctuations, FinPos employs dual decision agents. Furthermore,\nthe continuous nature of position management necessitates our adoption of\nmulti-timescale rewards, which in turn empowers FinPos to effectively balance\nshort-term fluctuations against long-term trends. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that FinPos surpasses state-of-the-art trading agents in the\nposition-aware trading task, which closely mirrors real market conditions. More\nimportantly, our findings reveal that LLM-centered agent systems exhibit a\nvast, largely unexplored potential in long-term market decision-making.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc5f0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ud3ec\uc9c0\uc158 \uad00\ub9ac\ub97c \uace0\ub824\ud55c \ud3ec\uc9c0\uc158 \uc778\uc2dd \uac70\ub798 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub41c \uac70\ub798 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c FinPos\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud55c\ub2e4.

While these guardrails often fail to interpret the\nencoded content, the underlying models can still process the harmful\ninstructions. We introduce CPT-Filtering, a novel, model-agnostic with\nnegligible-costs and near-perfect accuracy guardrail technique that aims to\nmitigate these attacks by leveraging the intrinsic behavior of Byte-Pair\nEncoding (BPE) tokenizers. Our method is based on the principle that\ntokenizers, trained on natural language, represent out-of-distribution text,\nsuch as ciphers, using a significantly higher number of shorter tokens. Our\ntechnique uses a simple yet powerful artifact of using language models: the\naverage number of Characters Per Token (CPT) in the text. This approach is\nmotivated by the high compute cost of modern methods - relying on added modules\nsuch as dedicated LLMs or perplexity models. We validate our approach across a\nlarge dataset of over 100,000 prompts, testing numerous encoding schemes with\nseveral popular tokenizers.

However, existing LLM-agent-based analytics\nframeworks operate under the assumption of centralized data access, offering\nlittle to no privacy protection. In contrast, federated analytics (FA) enables\nprivacy-preserving computation across distributed data sources, but lacks\nsupport for natural language input and requires structured, machine-readable\nqueries. In this work, we present LAFA, the first system that integrates\nLLM-agent-based data analytics with FA. LAFA introduces a hierarchical\nmulti-agent architecture that accepts natural language queries and transforms\nthem into optimized, executable FA workflows. A coarse-grained planner first\ndecomposes complex queries into sub-queries, while a fine-grained planner maps\neach subquery into a Directed Acyclic Graph of FA operations using prior\nstructural knowledge. To improve execution efficiency, an optimizer agent\nrewrites and merges multiple DAGs, eliminating redundant operations and\nminimizing computational and communicational overhead. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that LAFA consistently outperforms baseline prompting strategies by\nachieving higher execution plan success rates and reducing resource-intensive\nFA operations by a substantial margin.

Yet, the security implications of\ndeploying such agents in adversarial mobile environments remain poorly\nunderstood. In this paper, we present the first systematic study of security\nrisks in mobile LLM agents. We design and evaluate a suite of adversarial case\nstudies, ranging from opportunistic manipulations such as pop-up advertisements\nto advanced, end-to-end workflows involving malware installation and cross-app\ndata exfiltration. Our evaluation covers eight state-of-the-art mobile agents\nacross three architectures, with over 2,000 adversarial and paired benign\ntrials. The results reveal systemic vulnerabilities: low-barrier vectors such\nas fraudulent ads succeed with over 80% reliability, while even workflows\nrequiring the circumvention of operating-system warnings, such as malware\ninstallation, are consistently completed by advanced multi-app agents. By\nmapping these attacks to the MITRE ATT&CK Mobile framework, we uncover novel\nprivilege-escalation and persistence pathways unique to LLM-driven automation.\nCollectively, our findings provide the first end-to-end evidence that mobile\nLLM agents are exploitable in realistic adversarial settings, where untrusted\nthird-party channels (e.g., ads, embedded webviews, cross-app notifications)\nare an inherent part of the mobile ecosystem.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc704\ud5d8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uacf5\uaca9 \ubca1\ud130\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \ubc1d\ud799\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc6b0\ub824\ub97c \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uae30\ud68c\uc801 \uc870\uc791\uacfc \uc545\uc131\ucf54\ub4dc \uc124\uce58\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uc0ac\ub840 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uace0 \ud3c9\uac00\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "2,000\uac74 \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ubc0f benign \uc2dc\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc870\uc0ac\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, \uace0\uae09 \uba40\ud2f0 \uc571 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc6b4\uc601 \uccb4\uc81c \uacbd\uace0\ub97c \uc6b0\ud68c\ud558\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uc218\ud589\ud568\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ube44\uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uc81c3\uc790 \ucc44\ub110\uc774 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\ub294 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc545\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \uc5d4\ub4dc \ud22c \uc5d4\ub4dc \uc99d\uac70\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \ubcc0\ud654\uc2dc\ucf1c, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uacfc \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud560 \uac83\uc744 \uc57d\uc18d\ud558\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub77c\ub294 AI \uc9c0\uc6d0 \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc801\ub300\uc801\uc778 \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \ubc30\uce58\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc758\ubbf8\ub294 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc798 \uc774\ud574\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc704\ud5d8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud31d\uc5c5 \uad11\uace0\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uae30\ud68c\uc801 \uc870\uc791\uc5d0\uc11c \uc545\uc131\ucf54\ub4dc \uc124\uce58 \ubc0f \ud06c\ub85c\uc2a4 \uc571 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc720\ucd9c\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \uace0\uae09\uc758 \uc5d4\ub4dc \ud22c \uc5d4\ub4dc \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\uc5d0 \uc774\ub974\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc0ac\ub840 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uace0 \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc5ec\ub35f \uac1c\uc758 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uace0, 2,000\uac74 \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ubc0f \uc30d \uc0dd\ub9ac \uc2dc\ud5d8\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uc0ac\uae30\uc131 \uad11\uace0\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ub0ae\uc740 \uc7a5\ubcbd \ubca1\ud130\uac00 80% \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc131\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \ubc18\uba74, \uc545\uc131\ucf54\ub4dc \uc124\uce58\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uacbd\uace0\ub97c \uc6b0\ud68c\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uc5d0\ub3c4 \uace0\uae09 \uba40\ud2f0 \uc571 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uc644\ub8cc\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Denario can perform many different tasks, such\nas generating ideas, checking the literature, developing research plans,\nwriting and executing code, making plots, and drafting and reviewing a\nscientific paper. The system has a modular architecture, allowing it to handle\nspecific tasks, such as generating an idea, or carrying out end-to-end\nscientific analysis using Cmbagent as a deep-research backend. In this work, we\ndescribe in detail Denario and its modules, and illustrate its capabilities by\npresenting multiple AI-generated papers generated by it in many different\nscientific disciplines such as astrophysics, biology, biophysics, biomedical\ninformatics, chemistry, material science, mathematical physics, medicine,\nneuroscience and planetary science. Denario also excels at combining ideas from\ndifferent disciplines, and we illustrate this by showing a paper that applies\nmethods from quantum physics and machine learning to astrophysical data. We\nreport the evaluations performed on these papers by domain experts, who\nprovided both numerical scores and review-like feedback. We then highlight the\nstrengths, weaknesses, and limitations of the current system. Finally, we\ndiscuss the ethical implications of AI-driven research and reflect on how such\ntechnology relates to the philosophy of science. We publicly release the code\nat https://github.com/AstroPilot-AI/Denario.

Of these ``regular users'', up to a\nthird exhibited behaviors that may enable attacks, and a fourth have tried\njailbreaking (often out of understandable reasons such as curiosity, fun or\ninformation seeking). Half state that they sanitize data and most participants\nreport not sharing sensitive data. However, few share very sensitive data such\nas passwords. The majority are unaware that their data can be used to train\nmodels and that they can opt-out. Our findings suggest that current academic\nthreat models manifest in the wild, and mitigations or guidelines for the\nsecure usage of CAs should be developed. In areas critical to security and\nprivacy, CAs must be equipped with effective AI guardrails to prevent, for\nexample, revealing sensitive information to curious employees. Vendors need to\nincrease efforts to prevent the entry of sensitive data, and to create\ntransparency with regard to data usage policies and settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI \uae30\ubc18

While on-the-fly self-speculative methods offer seamless integration\nand broad utility, they often fall short of the speed gains achieved by methods\nrelying on specialized training. Cascading a hierarchy of draft models promises\nfurther acceleration and flexibility, but the high cost of training multiple\nmodels has limited its practical application. In this paper, we propose a novel\nCascade Adaptive Self-Speculative Decoding (CAS-Spec) method which constructs\nspeculative draft models by leveraging dynamically switchable inference\nacceleration (DSIA) strategies, including layer sparsity and activation\nquantization. Furthermore, traditional vertical and horizontal cascade\nalgorithms are inefficient when applied to self-speculative decoding methods.\nWe introduce a Dynamic Tree Cascade (DyTC) algorithm that adaptively routes the\nmulti-level draft models and assigns the draft lengths, based on the heuristics\nof acceptance rates and latency prediction. Our CAS-Spec method achieves\nstate-of-the-art acceleration compared to existing on-the-fly speculative\ndecoding methods, with an average speedup from $1.1\\times$ to $2.3\\times$ over\nautoregressive decoding across various LLMs and datasets. DyTC improves the\naverage speedup by $47$\\% and $48$\\% over cascade-based baseline and tree-based\nbaseline algorithms, respectively. CAS-Spec can be easily integrated into most\nexisting LLMs and holds promising potential for further acceleration as\nself-speculative decoding techniques continue to evolve.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 CAS-Spec\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uce74\uc2a4\ucf00\uc774\ub4dc \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc790\uae30 \ucd94\uce21 \ub514\ucf54\ub529 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \uc190\uc2e4 \uc5c6\ub294 \ucd94\ub860 \uac00\uc18d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uae30\uc220\ub85c\uc11c\uc758 \uc790\uc18d \ucd94\uce21 \ub514\ucf54\ub529\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc790\uc18d \ucd94\uce21 \ub514\ucf54\ub529\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ubc30\ud3ec\ud560 \ub54c \uc190\uc2e4 \uc5c6\ub294 \ucd94\ub860 \uac00\uc18d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uae30\uc220\ub85c \ub110\ub9ac \ucc44\ud0dd\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "CAS-Spec \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\ud658 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uac00\uc18d\ud654 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ucd94\uce21 \ucd08\uc548 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uba70, \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub3d9\uc801 \ud2b8\ub9ac \uce74\uc2a4\ucf00\uc774\ub4dc \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uba40\ud2f0 \ub808\ubca8 \ucd08\uc548 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub77c\uc6b0\ud305\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "CAS-Spec \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc790\uc18d \ucd94\uce21 \ub514\ucf54\ub529 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc800\uc18d\ub3c4\ub85c \ud3c9\uade0 $1.1\times$\uc5d0\uc11c $2.3\times$\uc758 \uc18d\ub3c4 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "CAS-Spec\uc740 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \uae30\uc874 LLM\uc5d0 \uc27d\uac8c \ud1b5\ud569\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc790\uc18d \ucd94\uce21 \ub514\ucf54\ub529 \uae30\uc220\uc758 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ubc1c\uc804\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ucd94\uac00\uc801\uc778 \uac00\uc18d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud22c\uae30\uc801 \ub514\ucf54\ub529\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc744 \ubc30\ud3ec\ud560 \ub54c \uc190\uc2e4 \uc5c6\ub294 \ucd94\ub860 \uac00\uc18d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uae30\uc220\ub85c \ub110\ub9ac \ucc44\ud0dd\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc989\uac01\uc801\uc778 \uc790\uae30 \ud22c\uae30 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc6d0\ud65c\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569\uacfc \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc720\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc804\ubb38 \ud6c8\ub828\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc18d\ub3c4 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc5d0\ub294 \ubbf8\uce58\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd08\uc548 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uacc4\uce35\uc744 \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ub354 \ud070 \uac00\uc18d\ud654\uc640 \uc720\uc5f0\uc131\uc744 \uc57d\uc18d\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub2e4\uc218 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\ub294 \ub192\uc740 \ube44\uc6a9\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc751\uc6a9\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\ud658 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uac00\uc18d\ud654(DSIA) \uc804\ub7b5, \uc989 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4 \ud76c\uc18c\uc131 \ubc0f \ud65c\uc131\ud654 \uc591\uc790\ud654\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud22c\uae30 \ucd08\uc548 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uad6c\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uce74\uc2a4\ucf00\uc774\ub4dc \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc790\uae30 \ud22c\uae30 \ub514\ucf54\ub529(CAS-Spec) \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub354\uc6b1\uc774 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc218\uc9c1 \ubc0f \uc218\ud3c9 \uce74\uc2a4\ucf00\uc774\ub4dc \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \uc790\uae30 \ud22c\uae30\uc801 \ub514\ucf54\ub529 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud560 \ub54c \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc218\uc6a9 \ube44\uc728 \ubc0f \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc608\uce21\uc758 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uba40\ud2f0 \ub808\ubca8 \ucd08\uc548 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub77c\uc6b0\ud305\ud558\uace0 \ucd08\uc548 \uae38\uc774\ub97c \ud560\ub2f9\ud558\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801 \ud2b8\ub9ac \uce74\uc2a4\ucf00\uc774\ub4dc(DyTC) \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 CAS-Spec \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c LLM \ubc0f \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 autoregressive \ub514\ucf54\ub529\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uade0 $1.1\times$\uc5d0\uc11c $2.3\times$\uc758 \uc18d\ub3c4 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc989\uac01\uc801\uc778 \ud22c\uae30\uc801 \ub514\ucf54\ub529 \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uac00\uc18d\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Openness in MARL refers\nto the dynam-ic nature of agent populations, tasks, and agent types with-in a\nsystem. Specifically, there are three types of openness as reported in (Eck et\nal. 2023) [2]: agent openness, where agents can enter or leave the system at\nany time; task openness, where new tasks emerge, and existing ones evolve or\ndisappear; and type openness, where the capabil-ities and behaviors of agents\nchange over time. This report provides a conceptual and empirical review,\nfocusing on the interplay between openness and the credit assignment problem\n(CAP). CAP involves determining the contribution of individual agents to the\noverall system performance, a task that becomes increasingly complex in open\nenviron-ments. Traditional credit assignment (CA) methods often assume static\nagent populations, fixed and pre-defined tasks, and stationary types, making\nthem inadequate for open systems. We first conduct a conceptual analysis,\nin-troducing new sub-categories of openness to detail how events like agent\nturnover or task cancellation break the assumptions of environmental\nstationarity and fixed team composition that underpin existing CAP methods. We\nthen present an empirical study using representative temporal and structural\nalgorithms in an open environment.

As agents increasingly consume these\nservices, discovery becomes critical: which swap interface should an agent\ntrust? Which data provider is the most reliable? We introduce TraceRank, a\nreputation-weighted ranking algorithm where payment transactions serve as\nendorsements. TraceRank seeds addresses with precomputed reputation metrics and\npropagates reputation through payment flows weighted by transaction value and\ntemporal recency. Applied to x402's payment graph, this surfaces services\npreferred by high-reputation users rather than those with high transaction\nvolume. Our system combines TraceRank with semantic search to respond to\nnatural language queries with high quality results. We argue that reputation\npropagation resists Sybil attacks by making spam services with many\nlow-reputation payers rank below legitimate services with few high-reputation\npayers.

To address this, we\npresent a probabilistic hierarchical Bayesian model that deconvolves bulk\nRNA-seq data into constituent cell-type expression profiles and proportions,\nleveraging a high-resolution single-cell reference. We apply our model to human\nendometrial tissue across the menstrual cycle, a context characterized by\ndramatic hormone-driven cellular composition changes. Our extended framework\nprovides a principled inference of cell type proportions and cell-specific gene\nexpression changes across cycle phases. We demonstrate the model's structure,\npriors, and inference strategy in detail, and we validate its performance with\nsimulations and comparisons to existing methods. The results reveal dynamic\nshifts in epithelial, stromal, and immune cell fractions between menstrual\nphases, and identify cell-type-specific differential gene expression associated\nwith endometrial function (e.g., decidualization markers in stromal cells\nduring the secretory phase). We further conduct robustness tests and show that\nour Bayesian approach is resilient to reference mismatches and noise.

In this work, we emphasize the importance of learning ability,\nincluding both self-improvement and peer-learning, as a core driver for agent\nevolution toward human-level intelligence. We propose an iterative, competitive\npeer-learning framework, which allows agents to refine and optimize their\nstrategies through repeated interactions and feedback, thereby systematically\nevaluating their learning capabilities. To address the score saturation issue\nin current benchmarks, we introduce CATArena, a tournament-style evaluation\nplatform featuring four diverse board and card games with open-ended scoring.\nBy providing tasks without explicit upper score limits, CATArena enables\ncontinuous and dynamic evaluation of rapidly advancing agent capabilities.\nExperimental results and analyses involving both minimal and commercial code\nagents demonstrate that CATArena provides reliable, stable, and scalable\nbenchmarking for core agent abilities, particularly learning ability and\nstrategy coding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc790\uae30 \uac1c\uc120 \ubc0f \ub3d9\ub8cc \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc778\uac04 \uc218\uc900 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c4\ud654\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.

This compression hinders\nverification by lacking explicit, step-wise justifications and inhibits\ncross-domain links by collapsing the very pathways that establish the logical\nand causal connections between concepts. We introduce a scalable framework that\ndecompresses scientific reasoning, constructing a verifiable Long\nChain-of-Thought (LCoT) knowledge base and projecting it into an emergent\nencyclopedia, SciencePedia. Our pipeline operationalizes an endpoint-driven,\nreductionist strategy: a Socratic agent, guided by a curriculum of around 200\ncourses, generates approximately 3 million first-principles questions. To\nensure high fidelity, multiple independent solver models generate LCoTs, which\nare then rigorously filtered by prompt sanitization and cross-model answer\nconsensus, retaining only those with verifiable endpoints. This verified corpus\npowers the Brainstorm Search Engine, which performs inverse knowledge search --\nretrieving diverse, first-principles derivations that culminate in a target\nconcept.

Effective tuning of these parameters is essential for\nadapting to diverse workloads and maximizing throughput while minimizing\nlatency. Recent research has focused on automated configuration optimization\nusing machine learning; however, existing approaches still exhibit several key\nlimitations. Most tuning frameworks disregard the dependencies among\nparameters, assuming that each operates independently. This simplification\nprevents optimizers from leveraging relational effects across parameters,\nlimiting their capacity to capture performancesensitive interactions. Moreover,\nto reduce the complexity of the high-dimensional search space, prior work often\nselects only the top few parameters for optimization, overlooking others that\ncontribute meaningfully to performance. Bayesian Optimization (BO), the most\ncommon method for automatic tuning, is also constrained by its reliance on\nsurrogate models, which can lead to unstable predictions and inefficient\nexploration. To overcome these limitations, we propose RelTune, a novel\nframework that represents parameter dependencies as a Relational Graph and\nlearns GNN-based latent embeddings that encode performancerelevant semantics.\nRelTune further introduces Hybrid-Score-Guided Bayesian Optimization (HBO),\nwhich combines surrogate predictions with an Affinity Score measuring proximity\nto previously high-performing configurations. Experimental results on multiple\nDBMSs and workloads demonstrate that RelTune achieves faster convergence and\nhigher optimization efficiency than conventional BO-based methods, achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance across all evaluated scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "RelTune\uc740 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \uac04\uc758 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \uad00\uacc4\ud615

Existing defense strategies preemptively build\nrobustness via attack simulation but suffer from fundamental limitations: (i)\nthe infeasibility of extending attack simulations beyond bounded threat models\ndue to the inherent difficulty of anticipating unknown attacks, and (ii)\nlimited adaptability to varying attack settings, as simulation fails to capture\ntheir variability and complexity. To address these challenges, we propose\nBayesian Data Scheduler (BDS), an adaptive tuning-stage defense strategy with\nno need for attack simulation. BDS formulates harmful fine-tuning defense as a\nBayesian inference problem, learning the posterior distribution of each data\npoint's safety attribute, conditioned on the fine-tuning and alignment\ndatasets. The fine-tuning process is then constrained by weighting data with\ntheir safety attributes sampled from the posterior, thus mitigating the\ninfluence of harmful data. By leveraging the post hoc nature of Bayesian\ninference, the posterior is conditioned on the fine-tuning dataset, enabling\nBDS to tailor its defense to the specific dataset, thereby achieving adaptive\ndefense. Furthermore, we introduce a neural scheduler based on amortized\nBayesian learning, enabling efficient transfer to new data without retraining.\nComprehensive results across diverse attack and defense settings demonstrate\nthe state-of-the-art performance of our approach.

However,\nprior work often overlooks real-world factors, such as Virtual Machine (VM)\ncold starts, requests under long-tail service time distributions, etc. To\ntackle these limitations, we model each ML query (request) as traversing an\nacyclic sequence of stages, wherein each stage constitutes a contiguous block\nof sparse model parameters ending in an internal or final classifier where\nrequests may exit. Since input-dependent exit rates vary, no single resource\nconfiguration suits all query distributions. IaaS-based VMs become\nunderutilized when many requests exit early, yet rapidly scaling to handle\nrequest bursts reaching deep layers is impractical. SERFLOW addresses this\nchallenge by leveraging FaaS-based serverless functions (containers) and using\nstage-specific resource provisioning that accounts for the fraction of requests\nexiting at each stage. By integrating this provisioning with adaptive load\nbalancing across VMs and serverless functions based on request ingestion,\nSERFLOW reduces cloud costs by over $23\\%$ while efficiently adapting to\ndynamic workloads.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc624\ud504\ub85c\ub4dc\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\uace0 \ucc98\ub9ac \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc744 \uade0\ud615 \uc788\uac8c \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c \uac04\uacfc\ub41c \ud604\uc2e4\uc801 \uc694\uc778\ub4e4\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0\uc11c \ucc98\ub9ac \ubc0f \uc804\uc1a1 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc744 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\uace0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc790\uc6d0 \uc624\ucf00\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uac04\uc758 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc624\ud504\ub85c\ub4dc\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\uac01 ML \ucffc\ub9ac\ub97c \ube44\uc21c\ud658\uc801 \ub2e8\uacc4 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uace0, \uac01 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc694\uccad\uc774 \uc885\ub8cc\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub0b4\ubd80 \ub610\ub294 \ucd5c\uc885 \ubd84\ub958\uae30\uc5d0 \uc774\ub974\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \ube14\ub85d\uc744 \uad6c\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "SERFLOW\ub294 \ub2e8\uacc4\ubcc4 \uc790\uc6d0 \ud504\ub85c\ube44\uc800\ub2dd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uac01 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc885\ub8cc\ub418\ub294 \uc694\uccad\uc758 \ube44\uc728\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud558\uc5ec \ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 23% \uc774\uc0c1 \uc904\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "SERFLOW\ub294 VM \ubc0f \uc11c\ubc84\ub9ac\uc2a4 \ud568\uc218 \uac04\uc758 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ub85c\ub4dc \ubc38\ub7f0\uc2f1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c\ub4dc\uc5d0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc801\uc751\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uc808\uac10\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5(ML) \ubaa8\ub378 \ud30c\ud2f0\uc158\uc758 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc624\ud504\ub85c\ub4dc\ub294 \uae30\ub2a5-\uc11c\ube44\uc2a4(FaaS) \ubc0f \uc778\ud504\ub77c-\uc11c\ube44\uc2a4(IaaS)\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc790\uc6d0 \uc624\ucf00\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ucc98\ub9ac \ubc0f \uc804\uc1a1 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc744 \uade0\ud615 \uc788\uac8c \uc870\uc815\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ucd94\ub860 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc758 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654 \ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc885\uc885 \uac00\uc0c1 \uba38\uc2e0(VM) \ucc28\uac00\uc6c0 \uc2dc\uc791, \uae34 \uaf2c\ub9ac \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uc2dc\uac04 \ubd84\ud3ec\ud558\uc758 \uc694\uccad \ub4f1\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \uc694\uc778\uc744 \uac04\uacfc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac01 ML \ucffc\ub9ac(\uc694\uccad)\ub97c \ub2e8\uacc4\uc758 \ube44\uc21c\ud658 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\ub97c \ud1b5\uacfc\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uac01 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub294 \uc694\uccad\uc774 \uc885\ub8cc\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub0b4\ubd80 \ub610\ub294 \ucd5c\uc885 \ubd84\ub958\uae30\uc5d0 \ub05d\ub098\ub294 \ud76c\uc18c \ubaa8\ub378 \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130\uc758 \uc5f0\uc18d \ube14\ub85d\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc785\ub825 \uc758\uc874\uc758 \uc885\ub8cc \ube44\uc728\uc774 \ub2ec\ub77c\uc9c0\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ucffc\ub9ac \ubd84\ud3ec\uc5d0 \uc801\ud569\ud55c \ub2e8\uc77c \ub9ac\uc18c\uc2a4 \uad6c\uc131\uc740 \uc5c6\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc694\uccad\uc774 \uc77c\ucc0d \uc885\ub8cc\ub420 \ub54c IaaS \uae30\ubc18 VM\uc740 \ud65c\uc6a9\ub3c4\uac00 \ub5a8\uc5b4\uc9c0\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae4a\uc740 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\uc5d0 \ub3c4\ub2ec\ud558\ub294 \uc694\uccad \ud3ed\uc8fc\ub97c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc2e0\uc18d\ud558\uac8c \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ube44\ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.

We present a practical\nimplementation of a data flywheel in NVInfo AI, NVIDIA's Mixture-of-Experts\n(MoE) Knowledge Assistant serving over 30,000 employees. By operationalizing a\nMAPE-driven data flywheel, we built a closed-loop system that systematically\naddresses failures in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines and\nenables continuous learning. Over a 3-month post-deployment period, we\nmonitored feedback and collected 495 negative samples. Analysis revealed two\nmajor failure modes: routing errors (5.25\\%) and query rephrasal errors\n(3.2\\%). Using NVIDIA NeMo microservices, we implemented targeted improvements\nthrough fine-tuning. For routing, we replaced a Llama 3.1 70B model with a\nfine-tuned 8B variant, achieving 96\\% accuracy, a 10x reduction in model size,\nand 70\\% latency improvement. For query rephrasal, fine-tuning yielded a 3.7\\%\ngain in accuracy and a 40\\% latency reduction. Our approach demonstrates how\nhuman-in-the-loop (HITL) feedback, when structured within a data flywheel,\ntransforms enterprise AI agents into self-improving systems.

Given this progress, we assess how\nwell these models can grade proofs: detecting errors, judging their severity,\nand assigning fair scores beyond binary correctness. We study proof-analysis\ncapabilities using a corpus of 90 Gemini 2.5 Pro-generated solutions that we\ngrade on a 1-4 scale with detailed error annotations, and on MathArena solution\nsets for IMO/USAMO 2025 scored on a 0-7 scale. Our analysis shows that models\ncan reliably flag incorrect (including subtly incorrect) solutions but exhibit\ncalibration gaps in how partial credit is assigned. To address this, we\nintroduce agentic workflows that extract and analyze reference solutions and\nautomatically derive problem-specific rubrics for a multi-step grading process.\nWe instantiate and compare different design choices for the grading workflows,\nand evaluate their trade-offs. Across our annotated corpus and MathArena, our\nproposed workflows achieve higher agreement with human grades and more\nconsistent handling of partial credit across metrics.

Our results suggest that by combining reasoning LLMs with structured\nexperimentation, an AI can produce creative and understandable designs for\ncomplex systems problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Glia\ub294 \uc778\uac04 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc758 \ucc3d\uc758\uc131\uacfc \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uacfc \ub3d9\ub4f1\ud55c \ucef4\ud4e8\ud130 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 AI \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AI\uac00 \uc778\uac04 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc758 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ucc3d\uc758\uc131\uacfc \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc73c\ub85c \ucef4\ud4e8\ud130 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0 \uc5ec\ubd80\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud0d0\uad6c.", "method": "Glia\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uac01 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ucd94\ub860, \uc2e4\ud5d8 \ubc0f \ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0 \ud2b9\ud654\ub418\uc5b4 \ud611\ub825\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ubd84\uc0b0 GPU \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud588\uc744 \ub54c Glia\ub294 \uc694\uccad \ub77c\uc6b0\ud305, \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\ub9c1 \ubc0f \uc790\ub3d9 \ud655\uc7a5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uc778\uac04 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub0b8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ucd94\ub860 LLM\uacfc \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 AI\uac00 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucc3d\uc758\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc774\ud574 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "AI\uac00 \uc778\uac04 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc758 \ucc3d\uc758\uc131\uacfc \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uacfc \ub3d9\ub4f1\ud55c \uc218\uc900\uc73c\ub85c \ucef4\ud4e8\ud130 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc124\uacc4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc744\uae4c? \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc778\uac04 \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub85c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \uc704\ud55c AI \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc778 Glia\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \uac01 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ucd94\ub860, \uc2e4\ud5d8 \ubc0f \ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0 \ud2b9\ud654\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ucd94\uc0c1\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc2e4\uc99d\uc801 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uc5ec \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud611\ub825\ud55c\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c ML \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc \ub2ec\ub9ac, Glia\ub294 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uadf8 \ucd94\ub860 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ub178\ucd9c\ud55c\ub2e4.

Bogdan contributed equally to this work, and\n  their listed order was determined by coinflip", "summary": "Most work interpreting reasoning models studies only a single\nchain-of-thought (CoT), yet these models define distributions over many\npossible CoTs. We argue that studying a single sample is inadequate for\nunderstanding causal influence and the underlying computation. Though fully\nspecifying this distribution is intractable, it can be understood by sampling.\nWe present case studies using resampling to investigate model decisions. First,\nwhen a model states a reason for its action, does that reason actually cause\nthe action? In \"agentic misalignment\" scenarios, we resample specific sentences\nto measure their downstream effects. Self-preservation sentences have small\ncausal impact, suggesting they do not meaningfully drive blackmail. Second, are\nartificial edits to CoT sufficient for steering reasoning? These are common in\nliterature, yet take the model off-policy. Resampling and selecting a\ncompletion with the desired property is a principled on-policy alternative. We\nfind off-policy interventions yield small and unstable effects compared to\nresampling in decision-making tasks. Third, how do we understand the effect of\nremoving a reasoning step when the model may repeat it post-edit? We introduce\na resilience metric that repeatedly resamples to prevent similar content from\nreappearing downstream. Critical planning statements resist removal but have\nlarge effects when eliminated. Fourth, since CoT is sometimes \"unfaithful\", can\nour methods teach us anything in these settings?

We present a reasoning-enhanced framework that\nsystematically integrates structured reasoning, action prediction, and history\nsummarization. The structured reasoning component generates coherent\nChain-of-Thought analyses combining progress estimation and decision reasoning,\nwhich inform both immediate action predictions and compact history summaries\nfor future steps. Based on this framework, we train a GUI agent,\n\\textbf{GUI-Rise}, through supervised fine-tuning on pseudo-labeled\ntrajectories and reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization\n(GRPO). This framework employs specialized rewards, including a history-aware\nobjective, directly linking summary quality to subsequent action performance.\nComprehensive evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art\nresults under identical training data conditions, with particularly strong\nperformance in out-of-domain scenarios. These findings validate our framework's\nability to maintain robust reasoning and generalization across diverse GUI\nnavigation tasks.

We test two pretraining regimes: (a) pretraining on\nheterogeneous real-world time series from multiple domains, and (b) pretraining\non purely synthetic data. We find that both variants yield strong performance,\nconsistently outperforming EEGNet, a widely used convolutional baseline, and\nCBraMod, the most recent EEG-specific foundation model. These results suggest\nthat generalist time series foundation models, even when pretrained on data of\nnon-neural origin or on synthetic signals, can transfer effectively to EEG.

This is particularly advantageous for complex\nnon-Markovian tasks because agents with access to RMs can learn more\nefficiently from fewer samples. However, learning with RMs is ill-suited for\nlong-horizon problems in which a set of subtasks can be executed in any order.\nIn such cases, the amount of information to learn increases exponentially with\nthe number of unordered subtasks. In this work, we address this limitation by\nintroducing three generalisations of RMs: (1) Numeric RMs allow users to\nexpress complex tasks in a compact form. (2) In Agenda RMs, states are\nassociated with an agenda that tracks the remaining subtasks to complete. (3)\nCoupled RMs have coupled states associated with each subtask in the agenda.\nFurthermore, we introduce a new compositional learning algorithm that leverages\ncoupled RMs: Q-learning with coupled RMs (CoRM).

However, data from different structures will follow\ndistinct distributions, potentially leading to large generalisation errors for\nmodels learnt via conventional machine learning methods. To address this issue,\ntransfer learning -- in the form of domain adaptation (DA) -- can be used to\nalign the data distributions. Most previous approaches have only considered\n\\emph{unsupervised} DA, where no labelled target data are available; they do\nnot consider how to incorporate these technologies in an online framework --\nupdating as labels are obtained throughout the monitoring campaign. This paper\nproposes a Bayesian framework for DA in PBSHM, that can improve unsupervised DA\nmappings using a limited quantity of labelled target data. In addition, this\nmodel is integrated into an active sampling strategy to guide inspections to\nselect the most informative observations to label -- leading to further\nreductions in the required labelled data to learn a target classifier. The\neffectiveness of this methodology is evaluated on a population of experimental\nbridges. Specifically, this population includes data corresponding to several\ndamage states, as well as, a comprehensive set of environmental conditions. It\nis found that combining transfer learning and active learning can improve data\nefficiency when learning classification models in label-scarce scenarios. This\nresult has implications for data-informed operation and maintenance of\nstructures, suggesting a reduction in inspections over the operational lifetime\nof a structure -- and therefore a reduction in operational costs -- can be\nachieved.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uad6c\uc870 \uac74\uac15 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub370\uc774\ud130

However, due to the inherently complex and diverse\nnature of multimodal information, enabling multimodal large language models\n(MLLMs) to flexibly and efficiently utilize external tools during reasoning\nremains an underexplored challenge. In this work, we introduce ToolScope, an\nagentic framework designed to unify global planning with local multimodal\nperception, adopting a specialized Perceive tool to mitigates visual context\ndegradation in long-horizon VQA task. ToolScope comprises three primary\ncomponents: the Global Navigator, the Agentic Executor, and the Response\nSynthesizer. The Global Navigator functions as a \"telescope\", offering\nhigh-level strategic guidance. The Agentic Executor operates iteratively to\naugment MLLM with local perception through the integration of external\ntools-Search, Code, and Perceive. Finally, the Response Synthesizer\nconsolidates and organizes the reasoning process into a coherent, user-friendly\noutput. We evaluate ToolScope on four VQA benchmarks across diverse domains,\nincluding VQA 2.0, ScienceQA, MAT-Search and MathVista. It demonstrates strong\ngeneralization capabilities, achieving an average performance improvement of up\nto +6.69% across all datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "ToolScope\ub294 \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc678\ubd80 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ud611\ub825\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "MLLM\uc774 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \uc815\ubcf4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc678\ubd80 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uc720\uc5f0\ud558\uace0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc810\uc744 \ub450\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "ToolScope\ub294 Global Navigator, Agentic Executor, Response Synthesizer\uc758 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "ToolScope\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c VQA \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uade0 +6.69%\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "ToolScope\ub294 \uc7a5\uae30\uc801\uc778 VQA \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \ubb38\ub9e5 \uc800\ud558\ub97c \uc644\ud654\ud558\uc5ec MLLM\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc740 \uc678\ubd80 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc640 \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ud611\ub825\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub180\ub77c\uc6b4 \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \uc815\ubcf4\uc758 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud558\uace0 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud2b9\uc131 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0, \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(MLLM)\uc774 \ucd94\ub860 \uc911 \uc678\ubd80 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uc720\uc5f0\ud558\uace0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \ud0d0\uc0c9\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc7a5\uae30\uc801\uc778 VQA \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \ub9e5\ub77d \uc800\ud558\ub97c \uc644\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud2b9\ud654\ub41c Perceive \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \ucc44\ud0dd\ud558\uc5ec \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uacc4\ud68d\uacfc \ub85c\uceec \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \uc778\uc2dd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 ToolScope\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, applying RAG to finance\nencounters critical challenges: restricted access to proprietary datasets,\nlimited retrieval accuracy, regulatory constraints, and sensitive data\ninterpretation. We introduce AstuteRAG-FQA, an adaptive RAG framework tailored\nfor Financial Question Answering (FQA), leveraging task-aware prompt\nengineering to address these challenges. The framework uses a hybrid retrieval\nstrategy integrating both open-source and proprietary financial data while\nmaintaining strict security protocols and regulatory compliance. A dynamic\nprompt framework adapts in real time to query complexity, improving precision\nand contextual relevance. To systematically address diverse financial queries,\nwe propose a four-tier task classification: explicit factual, implicit factual,\ninterpretable rationale, and hidden rationale involving implicit causal\nreasoning. For each category, we identify key challenges, datasets, and\noptimization techniques within the retrieval and generation process. The\nframework incorporates multi-layered security mechanisms including differential\nprivacy, data anonymization, and role-based access controls to protect\nsensitive financial information. Additionally, AstuteRAG-FQA implements\nreal-time compliance monitoring through automated regulatory validation systems\nthat verify responses against industry standards and legal obligations.

Existing\napproaches often rely on rule-based logic, game-theoretic models, or\n'black-box' machine learning methods. However, these models typically lack\nflexibility or overlook the underlying mechanisms, such as sensory and motor\nconstraints, which shape how pedestrians and drivers perceive and act in\ninteractive scenarios. In this study, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement\nlearning (RL) framework that integrates both visual and motor constraints of\npedestrian and driver agents. Using a real-world dataset from an unsignalised\npedestrian crossing, we evaluate four model variants, one without constraints,\ntwo with either motor or visual constraints, and one with both, across\nbehavioural metrics of interaction realism. Results show that the combined\nmodel with both visual and motor constraints performs best. Motor constraints\nlead to smoother movements that resemble human speed adjustments during\ncrossing interactions. The addition of visual constraints introduces perceptual\nuncertainty and field-of-view limitations, leading the agents to exhibit more\ncautious and variable behaviour, such as less abrupt deceleration. In this\ndata-limited setting, our model outperforms a supervised behavioural cloning\nmodel, demonstrating that our approach can be effective without large training\ndatasets. Finally, our framework accounts for individual differences by\nmodelling parameters controlling the human constraints as population-level\ndistributions, a perspective that has not been explored in previous work on\npedestrian-vehicle interaction modelling. Overall, our work demonstrates that\nmulti-agent RL with human constraints is a promising modelling approach for\nsimulating realistic road user interactions.", "AI": {"tldr":

We identify and prove a sufficient condition, when the\ntested graphs are symmetric decomposable (SD), under which the\nWeisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test is guaranteed to correctly detect isomorphism.\nBuilding on this, ORGEval integrates a tailored variant of the WL-test with an\nSD detection algorithm to evaluate model equivalence. By focusing on structural\nequivalence rather than instance-level configurations, ORGEval is robust to\nnumerical variations. Experimental results show that our method can\nsuccessfully detect model equivalence and produce 100\\% consistent results\nacross random parameter configurations, while significantly outperforming\nsolver-based methods in runtime, especially on difficult problems.

This challenge often traps users in\ninefficient trial-and-error loops and is exacerbated by the diverse expertise\nlevels of users. We reframe this problem from passive instruction following to\na Socratic collaboration paradigm, proposing an agent that actively probes for\ninformation to resolve its uncertainty about user intent. we name the proposed\nagent Nous, trained to acquire proficiency in this inquiry policy. The core\nmechanism of Nous is a training framework grounded in the first principles of\ninformation theory. Within this framework, we define the information gain from\ndialogue as an intrinsic reward signal, which is fundamentally equivalent to\nthe reduction of Shannon entropy over a structured task space. This reward\ndesign enables us to avoid reliance on costly human preference annotations or\nexternal reward models. To validate our framework, we develop an automated\nsimulation pipeline to generate a large-scale, preference-based dataset for the\nchallenging task of scientific diagram generation. Comprehensive experiments,\nincluding ablations, subjective and objective evaluations, and tests across\nuser expertise levels, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.\nNous achieves leading efficiency and output quality, while remaining robust to\nvarying user expertise.

However, to improve LLM reasoning, researchers\neither rely on ad-hoc generated datasets or formal mathematical proof systems\nsuch as the Lean proof assistant. Whilst ad-hoc generated methods can capture\nthe decision chains of real-world reasoning processes, they may encode some\ninadvertent bias in the space of reasoning they cover; they also cannot be\nformally verified. On the other hand, systems like Lean can guarantee\nverifiability, but are not well-suited to capture the nature of agentic\ndecision chain-based tasks. This creates a gap both in performance for\nfunctions such as business agents or code assistants, and in the usefulness of\nLLM reasoning benchmarks, whereby these fall short in reasoning structure or\nreal-world alignment. We introduce TempoBench, the first formally grounded and\nverifiable diagnostic benchmark that parametrizes difficulty to systematically\nanalyze how LLMs perform reasoning. TempoBench uses two evaluation benchmarks\nto break down reasoning ability. First, temporal trace evaluation (TTE) tests\nthe ability of an LLM to understand and simulate the execution of a given\nmulti-step reasoning system. Subsequently, temporal causal evaluation (TCE)\ntests an LLM's ability to perform multi-step causal reasoning and to distill\ncause-and-effect relations from complex systems.

To address this gap, we\nintroduce InnovatorBench, a benchmark-platform pair for realistic, end-to-end\nassessment of agents performing Large Language Model (LLM) research. It\ncomprises 20 tasks spanning Data Construction, Filtering, Augmentation, Loss\nDesign, Reward Design, and Scaffold Construction, which require runnable\nartifacts and assessment of correctness, performance, output quality, and\nuncertainty. To support agent operation, we develop ResearchGym, a research\nenvironment offering rich action spaces, distributed and long-horizon\nexecution, asynchronous monitoring, and snapshot saving. We also implement a\nlightweight ReAct agent that couples explicit reasoning with executable\nplanning using frontier models such as Claude-4, GPT-5, GLM-4.5, and Kimi-K2.\nOur experiments demonstrate that while frontier models show promise in\ncode-driven research tasks, they struggle with fragile algorithm-related tasks\nand long-horizon decision making, such as impatience, poor resource management,\nand overreliance on template-based reasoning.

Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise for\nHardware Description Language (HDL) generation, but face challenges due to\nlimited parametric knowledge and domain-specific constraints. While prompt\nengineering and fine-tuning have limitations in knowledge coverage and training\ncosts, multi-agent architectures offer a training-free paradigm to enhance\nreasoning through collaborative generation. However, current multi-agent\napproaches suffer from two critical deficiencies: susceptibility to noise\npropagation and constrained reasoning space exploration. We propose VeriMoA, a\ntraining-free mixture-of-agents (MoA) framework with two synergistic\ninnovations. First, a quality-guided caching mechanism to maintain all\nintermediate HDL outputs and enables quality-based ranking and selection across\nthe entire generation process, encouraging knowledge accumulation over layers\nof reasoning. Second, a multi-path generation strategy that leverages C++ and\nPython as intermediate representations, decomposing specification-to-HDL\ntranslation into two-stage processes that exploit LLM fluency in high-resource\nlanguages while promoting solution diversity.

However, such vision driven embodied agents open a new attack\nsurface: visual backdoor attacks, where the agent behaves normally until a\nvisual trigger appears in the scene, then persistently executes an\nattacker-specified multi-step policy. We introduce BEAT, the first framework to\ninject such visual backdoors into MLLM-based embodied agents using objects in\nthe environments as triggers. Unlike textual triggers, object triggers exhibit\nwide variation across viewpoints and lighting, making them difficult to implant\nreliably. BEAT addresses this challenge by (1) constructing a training set that\nspans diverse scenes, tasks, and trigger placements to expose agents to trigger\nvariability, and (2) introducing a two-stage training scheme that first applies\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) and then our novel Contrastive Trigger Learning\n(CTL). CTL formulates trigger discrimination as preference learning between\ntrigger-present and trigger-free inputs, explicitly sharpening the decision\nboundaries to ensure precise backdoor activation. Across various embodied agent\nbenchmarks and MLLMs, BEAT achieves attack success rates up to 80%, while\nmaintaining strong benign task performance, and generalizes reliably to\nout-of-distribution trigger placements. Notably, compared to naive SFT, CTL\nboosts backdoor activation accuracy up to 39% under limited backdoor data.\nThese findings expose a critical yet unexplored security risk in MLLM-based\nembodied agents, underscoring the need for robust defenses before real-world\ndeployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ube44\uc804 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc778\uacf5 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2dc\uac01 \ubc31\ub3c4\uc5b4 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \uac1c\ub150\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \uc8fc\uc785\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c BEAT \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ube44\uc804 \uae30\ubc18 \uc778\uacf5 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacf5\uaca9 \uacbd\ub85c\uc778 \uc2dc\uac01 \ubc31\ub3c4\uc5b4 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud658\uacbd \ub0b4 \ubb3c\uccb4\ub97c \ud2b8\ub9ac\uac70\ub85c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uace0, \uac10\ub3c5\ub41c \uc138\ubd80 \uc870\uc815(SFT)\uc640 \ub300\uc870\uc801 \ud2b8\ub9ac\uac70 \ud559\uc2b5(CTL)\uc744 \ub450 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub85c \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "BEAT\ub294 80%\uae4c\uc9c0\uc758 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "MLLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc778\uacf5 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ubc1d\ud600\ub0b4\uace0, \uc2e4\uc81c \ubc30\ud3ec \uc804\uc5d0 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ubc29\uc5b4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud568\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc2dc\uac01 \uc785\ub825\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc9c0\ud5a5\uc801\uc778 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc9c1\uc811 \uc778\uc2dd\ud558\uace0 \ucd94\ub860\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ub9cc\ub4e4\uc5b4\uc9c4 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(MLLM)\uc740 \uad6c\uccb4\ud654\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ubc1c\uc804\uc2dc\ucf30\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ube44\uc804 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacf5\uaca9 \ud45c\uba74\uc744 \uc5f4\uc5b4 \uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uc2dc\uac01 \ubc31\ub3c4\uc5b4 \uacf5\uaca9\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uacf5\uaca9\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc7a5\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \ud2b8\ub9ac\uac70\uac00 \ub4f1\uc7a5\ud558\uae30 \uc804\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc815\uc0c1\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud589\ub3d9\ud558\ub2e4\uac00, \uadf8 \ud6c4 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uacf5\uaca9\uc790\uac00 \uc9c0\uc815\ud55c \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc2e4\ud589\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubb3c\uccb4\ub97c \ud2b8\ub9ac\uac70\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec MLLM \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uad6c\uccb4\ud654\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc2dc\uac01 \ubc31\ub3c4\uc5b4\ub97c \uc8fc\uc785\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 BEAT\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud2b8\ub9ac\uac70\uc640\ub294 \ub2ec\ub9ac, \ubb3c\uccb4 \ud2b8\ub9ac\uac70\ub294 \uc2dc\uc810\uacfc \uc870\uba85\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \ubcf4\uc774\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc774\ub97c \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uc788\uac8c \uc0bd\uc785\ud558\uae30\uac00 \uc5b4\ub835\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, training them to succeed on long-horizon,\ndomain-specialized tasks remains challenging. Current methods primarily fall\ninto two categories. The first relies on dense human annotations through\nbehavior cloning, which is prohibitively expensive for long-horizon tasks that\ncan take days or months. The second depends on outcome-driven sampling, which\noften collapses due to the rarity of valid positive trajectories on\ndomain-specialized tasks. We introduce Apollo, a sampling framework that\nintegrates asynchronous human guidance with action-level data filtering.\nInstead of requiring annotators to shadow every step, Apollo allows them to\nintervene only when the agent drifts from a promising trajectory, by providing\nprior knowledge, strategic advice, etc. This lightweight design makes it\npossible to sustain interactions for over 30 hours and produces valuable\ntrajectories at a lower cost. Apollo then applies supervision control to filter\nout sub-optimal actions and prevent error propagation. Together, these\ncomponents enable reliable and effective data collection in long-horizon\nenvironments. To demonstrate the effectiveness of Apollo, we evaluate it using\nInnovatorBench. Our experiments show that when applied to train the GLM-4.5\nmodel on InnovatorBench, Apollo achieves more than a 50% improvement over the\nuntrained baseline and a 28% improvement over a variant trained without human\ninteraction. These results highlight the critical role of human-in-the-loop\nsampling and the robustness of Apollo's design in handling long-horizon,\ndomain-specialized tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Apollo\ub294 \ube44\ub3d9\uae30 \uc778\uac04 \uc548\ub0b4\uc640 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc218\uc900 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud544\ud130\ub9c1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uae34 \uc218\uba85 \uc8fc\uae30\uc758 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc804\ubb38 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc218\uc9d1\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub85c \uc778\ud574 GLM-4.5 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud6c8\ub828\uc5d0\uc11c 50% \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uae34 \uc218\uba85 \uc8fc\uae30\uc640 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc804\ubb38\ud654\ub41c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "Apollo\ub294 \ube44\ub3d9\uae30 \uc778\uac04 \uc548\ub0b4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uace0 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc218\uc900\uc5d0\uc11c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud544\ud130\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "result": "GLM-4.5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 InnovatorBench\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6c8\ub828\ud560 \ub54c, Apollo\ub294 \ubbf8\ud6c8\ub828 \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 50% \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uac1c\uc120\uacfc \uc778\uac04 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uc5c6\uc774 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ubcc0\uc885\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 28%\uc758 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Apollo\ub294 \uae34 \uc218\uba85 \uc8fc\uae30 \ubc0f \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc804\ubb38\ud654\ub41c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc5ed\ud560\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud568\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70, \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uace0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc218\uc9d1\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc124\uacc4\uc774\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ucd5c\uadfc \uc790\ub3d9 \ucf54\ub529, \uc2ec\uce35 \uc5f0\uad6c \ubc0f \uadf8\ub798\ud53d \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4 \uc870\uc791\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uadf8\ub4e4\uc744 \uae34 \uc218\uba85 \uc8fc\uae30 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc804\ubb38 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\uacf5\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc5b4\ub835\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud604\uc7ac \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc8fc\ub85c \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubc94\uc8fc\uc5d0 \uc18d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8\ub294 \ud589\ub3d9 \ud074\ub85c\ub2dd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubc00\uc9d1\ud55c \uc778\uac04 \uc8fc\uc11d\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294\ub370, \uc774\ub294 \uba70\uce60 \ub610\ub294 \uba87 \ub2ec\uc774 \uac78\ub9b4 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uae34 \uc218\uba85 \uc8fc\uae30 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uacfc\ub3c4\ud558\uac8c \ube44\uc309\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub450 \ubc88\uc9f8\ub294 \uacb0\uacfc \uae30\ubc18 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294\ub370, \uc774\ub294 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc804\ubb38 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\ud6a8\ud55c \uae0d\uc815\uc801 \uada4\uc801\uc758 \ud76c\uadc0\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc885\uc885 \ubb34\ub108\uc9d1\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ube44\ub3d9\uae30 \uc778\uac04 \uc548\ub0b4\uc640 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc218\uc900 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud544\ud130\ub9c1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Apollo\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.
