However, these capabilities also expose\nmodels to prompt injection attacks, where maliciously crafted inputs overwrite\nor distract from the intended instructions. A core vulnerability lies in the\nmodel's lack of semantic role understanding: it cannot distinguish directive\nintent from descriptive content, leading it to execute instruction-like phrases\nembedded in data.\n  We propose DRIP, a training-time defense grounded in a semantic modeling\nperspective, which enforces robust separation between instruction and data\nsemantics without sacrificing utility. DRIP introduces two lightweight yet\ncomplementary mechanisms: (1) a token-wise de-instruction shift that performs\nsemantic disentanglement, weakening directive semantics in data tokens while\npreserving content meaning; and (2) a residual fusion pathway that provides a\npersistent semantic anchor, reinforcing the influence of the true top-level\ninstruction during generation. Experimental results on LLaMA-8B and Mistral-7B\nacross three prompt injection benchmarks (SEP, AlpacaFarm, and InjecAgent)\ndemonstrate that DRIP outperforms state-of-the-art defenses, including StruQ,\nSecAlign, ISE, and PFT, improving role separation by 49%, and reducing attack\nsuccess rate by 66% for adaptive attacks.

Despite their\nversatility, LLMs face notable challenges, such as generating hallucinated\ncontent and lacking access to up-to-date information. Lately, to address such\nlimitations, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising\ndirection by generating responses grounded in external knowledge sources. A\ntypical RAG system consists of i) a retriever that probes a group of relevant\npassages from a knowledge base and ii) a generator that formulates a response\nbased on the retrieved content. However, as with other AI systems, recent\nstudies demonstrate the vulnerability of RAG, such as knowledge corruption\nattacks by injecting misleading information. In response, several defense\nstrategies have been proposed, including having LLMs inspect the retrieved\npassages individually or fine-tuning robust retrievers. While effective, such\napproaches often come with substantial computational costs.\n  In this work, we introduce RAGDefender, a resource-efficient defense\nmechanism against knowledge corruption (i.e., by data poisoning) attacks in\npractical RAG deployments. RAGDefender operates during the post-retrieval\nphase, leveraging lightweight machine learning techniques to detect and filter\nout adversarial content without requiring additional model training or\ninference. Our empirical evaluations show that RAGDefender consistently\noutperforms existing state-of-the-art defenses across multiple models and\nadversarial scenarios: e.g., RAGDefender reduces the attack success rate (ASR)\nagainst the Gemini model from 0.89 to as low as 0.02, compared to 0.69 for\nRobustRAG and 0.24 for Discern-and-Answer when adversarial passages outnumber\nlegitimate ones by a factor of four (4x)."}

Recent work proposes integrating\nverifiers that validate LLM output or actions, such as self-reflection, debate,\nor LLM-as-a-judge mechanisms.

Our solution, Sherlock, addresses these using\ncounterfactual analysis on agentic workflows to identify error-prone nodes and\nselectively attaching cost-optimal verifiers only where necessary. At runtime,\nSherlock speculatively executes downstream tasks to reduce latency overhead,\nwhile verification runs in the background.

In this work, we improve the\npractical feasibility of RL-based control of such flows focusing on\nRayleigh-B\\'enard Convection (RBC), a canonical model for convective heat\ntransport. To enhance generalization and sample efficiency, we introduce\ndomain-informed RL agents that are trained using Proximal Policy Optimization\nacross diverse initial conditions and flow regimes.

In laminar flow\nregimes, the domain-informed RL agents reduce convective heat transport by up\nto 33%, and in chaotic flow regimes, they still achieve a 10% reduction, which\nis significantly better than the conventional controllers used in practice. We\ncompare the domain-informed to uninformed agents: Our results show that the\ndomain-informed reward design results in steady flows, faster convergence\nduring training, and generalization across flow regimes without retraining.

In this study, we introduce two Knowledge\nElicitation methods designed to overcome these limitations by enabling large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to induce and apply domain-specific rules for cancer\nstaging. The first, Knowledge Elicitation with Long-Term Memory (KEwLTM), uses\nan iterative prompting strategy to derive staging rules directly from\nunannotated pathology reports, without requiring ground-truth labels. The\nsecond, Knowledge Elicitation with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KEwRAG),\nemploys a variation of RAG where rules are pre-extracted from relevant\nguidelines in a single step and then applied, enhancing interpretability and\navoiding repeated retrieval overhead. We leverage the ability of LLMs to apply\nbroad knowledge learned during pre-training to new tasks. Using breast cancer\npathology reports from the TCGA dataset, we evaluate their performance in\nidentifying T and N stages, comparing them against various baseline approaches\non two open-source LLMs. Our results indicate that KEwLTM outperforms KEwRAG\nwhen Zero-Shot Chain-of-Thought (ZSCOT) inference is effective, whereas KEwRAG\nachieves better performance when ZSCOT inference is less effective.

We present GLM, the first\nmulti-agent Graph-CoT system co-designed with an optimized LLM serving\narchitecture. GLM decomposes reasoning into specialized agents for\nclassification, reasoning, action generation, and graph retrieval, enabling\nbranching and selective context sharing to reduce prompt length and reasoning\niterations while preserving reasoning quality, thereby improving accuracy and\nreducing overall token consumption. To scale inference, we introduce a\nGraph-CoT-aware LLM inference mechanism with graph-specific KV-cache\nmanagement, priority-based eviction, and pipelined execution to improve serving\nefficiency. Experiments demonstrate that GLM improves answer accuracy by up to\n38%, reduces token cost by up to 95.7%, lowers inference latency by 90.3%, and\nachieves up to 15.1x higher throughput compared to state-of-the-art Graph-CoT\nbaselines, enabling efficient adoption for complex real-world reasoning at\nscale."}

This version includes\n  post-camera-ready revisions", "summary": "We present Fractional Diffusion Bridge Models (FDBM), a novel generative\ndiffusion bridge framework driven by an approximation of the rich and\nnon-Markovian fractional Brownian motion (fBM). Real stochastic processes\nexhibit a degree of memory effects (correlations in time), long-range\ndependencies, roughness and anomalous diffusion phenomena that are not captured\nin standard diffusion or bridge modeling due to the use of Brownian motion\n(BM). As a remedy, leveraging a recent Markovian approximation of fBM (MA-fBM),\nwe construct FDBM that enable tractable inference while preserving the\nnon-Markovian nature of fBM. We prove the existence of a coupling-preserving\ngenerative diffusion bridge and leverage it for future state prediction from\npaired training data. We then extend our formulation to the Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nbridge problem and derive a principled loss function to learn the unpaired data\ntranslation. We evaluate FDBM on both tasks: predicting future protein\nconformations from aligned data, and unpaired image translation. In both\nsettings, FDBM achieves superior performance compared to the Brownian\nbaselines, yielding lower root mean squared deviation (RMSD) of C$_\\alpha$\natomic positions in protein structure prediction and lower Fr\\'echet Inception\nDistance (FID) in unpaired image translation."}
