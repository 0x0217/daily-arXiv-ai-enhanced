Building on this tradition, Elkind et al. (2021) introduced a process for coalition formation that seeks majority-supported proposals preferable to the status quo, using a metric space where each agent has an ideal point. The crucial step in this iterative process involves identifying compromise proposals around which agent coalitions can unite. How to effectively find such compromise proposals, however, remains an open question. We address this gap by formalizing a holistic model that encompasses agent bounded rationality and uncertainty and developing AI models to generate such compromise proposals. We focus on the domain of collaboratively writing text documents -- e.g., to enable the democratic creation of a community constitution. We apply NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques and utilize LLMs (Large Language Models) to create a semantic metric space for text and develop algorithms to suggest suitable compromise points. To evaluate the effectiveness of our algorithms, we simulate various coalition formation processes and demonstrate the potential of AI to facilitate large-scale democratic text editing, such as collaboratively drafting a constitution, an area where traditional tools are limited.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI \ud558\uc704 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\uc548 \uac04\uc758 \ud0c0\ud611\uc744

However, evaluating each individual agent's effectiveness and online optimization of underperforming agents remain open challenges. To address these issues, we present HiveMind, a self-adaptive framework designed to optimize LLM multi-agent collaboration through contribution analysis. At its core, HiveMind introduces Contribution-Guided Online Prompt Optimization (CG-OPO), which autonomously refines agent prompts based on their quantified contributions. We first propose the Shapley value as a grounded metric to quantify each agent's contribution, thereby identifying underperforming agents in a principled manner for automated prompt refinement. To overcome the computational complexity of the classical Shapley value, we present DAG-Shapley, a novel and efficient attribution algorithm that leverages the inherent Directed Acyclic Graph structure of the agent workflow to axiomatically prune non-viable coalitions. By hierarchically reusing intermediate outputs of agents in the DAG, our method further reduces redundant computations, and achieving substantial cost savings without compromising the theoretical guarantees of Shapley values. Evaluated in a multi-agent stock-trading scenario, HiveMind achieves superior performance compared to static baselines.

This paper presents ChargingBoul, a negotiating agent that competed in the 2022 Automated Negotiating Agents Competition (ANAC) and placed second in individual utility by an exceptionally narrow margin. ChargingBoul employs a lightweight yet effective strategy that balances concession and opponent modeling to achieve high negotiation outcomes. The agent classifies opponents based on bid patterns, dynamically adjusts its bidding strategy, and applies a concession policy in later negotiation stages to maximize utility while fostering agreements. We evaluate ChargingBoul's performance using competition results and subsequent studies that have utilized the agent in negotiation research. Our analysis highlights ChargingBoul's effectiveness across diverse opponent strategies and its contributions to advancing automated negotiation techniques.

Although Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) offers promising capabilities for traffic signal control, ensuring safety in such environments remains difficult. As a direct indicator of traffic risk, the collision rate must be well understood and incorporated into traffic control design. This study investigates the primary factors influencing collision rates in a MARL-governed Mixed Traffic Control (MTC) network. We examine three dimensions: total vehicle count, signalized versus unsignalized intersection configurations, and turning-movement strategies. Through controlled simulation experiments, we evaluate how each factor affects collision likelihood. The results show that collision rates are sensitive to traffic density, the level of signal coordination, and turning-control design. These findings provide practical insights for improving the safety and robustness of MARL-based mixed traffic control systems, supporting the development of intelligent transportation systems in which both efficiency and safety are jointly optimized.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 MARL \uae30\ubc18 \ud63c\ud569\uad50\ud1b5 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \ucda9\ub3cc\ub960\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc694\uc778\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uc5ec \uc548\uc804\uc131\uacfc \uacac\uace0\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ud63c\ud569 \uad50\ud1b5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ucc28\ub7c9 \ucda9\ub3cc\uc740 \uc8fc\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc774\uba70, \ud2b9\ud788 \uc778\uac04 \uc6b4\uc804 \ucc28\ub7c9(HVs)\uacfc \ub85c\ubd07 \ucc28\ub7c9(RVs) \uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c \ub354\uc6b1 \uadf8\ub7ec\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ucd1d \ucc28\ub7c9 \uc218, \uc2e0\ud638\ud654 \ub300 \ube44\uc2e0\ud638\ud654 \uad50\ucc28\ub85c \uad6c\uc131, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \ud68c\uc804 \uc774\ub3d9 \uc804\ub7b5\uc758 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ucda9\ub3cc\ub960\uc740 \uad50\ud1b5 \ubc00\ub3c4, \uc2e0\ud638 \uc870\uc815 \uc218\uc900, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \ud68c\uc804 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc124\uacc4\uc5d0 \ubbfc\uac10\ud558\uac8c \ubc18\uc751\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 MARL \uae30\ubc18 \ud63c\ud569 \uad50\ud1b5 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uacfc \uacac\uace0\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0, \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc774 \uacf5\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub41c \uc9c0\ub2a5\ud615 \uad50\ud1b5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucc28\ub7c9 \ucda9\ub3cc\uc740 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ud63c\ud569 \uad50\ud1b5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud575\uc2ec\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub85c \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ud2b9\ud788 \uc778\uac04 \uc6b4\uc804 \ucc28\ub7c9(HVs)\uacfc \ub85c\ubd07 \ucc28\ub7c9(RVs)\uc774 \ub3d9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud55c \uc870\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ud560 \ub54c \ub354\uc6b1 \uadf8\ub7ec\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(MARL)\uc740 \uad50\ud1b5 \uc2e0\ud638 \uc81c\uc5b4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc5b4\ub835\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad50\ud1b5 \uc704\ud5d8\uc758 \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc778 \uc9c0\ud45c\ub85c\uc11c \ucda9\ub3cc\ub960\uc740 \uc798 \uc774\ud574\ub418\uace0 \uad50\ud1b5 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc124\uacc4\uc5d0 \ud3ec\ud568\ub418\uc5b4\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 MARL \uad00\ub9ac \ud63c\ud569 \uad50\ud1b5 \uc81c\uc5b4(MTC) \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ucda9\ub3cc\ub960\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc694\uc778\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ucd1d \ucc28\ub7c9 \uc218, \uc2e0\ud638\ud654 \ub300 \ube44\uc2e0\ud638\ud654 \uad50\ucc28\ub85c \uad6c\uc131, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \ud68c\uc804 \uc774\ub3d9 \uc804\ub7b5\uc758 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc5b4\ub41c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uac01 \uc694\uc778\uc774 \ucda9\ub3cc \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ucda9\ub3cc\ub960\uc774 \uad50\ud1b5 \ubc00\ub3c4, \uc2e0\ud638 \uc870\uc815 \uc218\uc900 \ubc0f \ud68c\uc804 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc124\uacc4\uc5d0 \ubbfc\uac10\ud558\uac8c \ubc18\uc751\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc1c\uacac\uc740 MARL \uae30\ubc18 \ud63c\ud569 \uad50\ud1b5 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uacfc \uacac\uace0\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc5ec, \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc774 \uacf5\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub418\ub294 \uc9c0\ub2a5\ud615 \uad50\ud1b5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

In particular, reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising path towards improving outcomes in such uncertain decision-making scenarios and moving beyond reactive strategies. However, training RL agents requires many environment interactions, and the speed of existing wildfire simulators is a severely limiting factor. We introduce $\\texttt{JaxWildfire}$, a simulator underpinned by a principled probabilistic fire spread model based on cellular automata. It is implemented in JAX and enables vectorized simulations using $\\texttt{vmap}$, allowing high throughput of simulations on GPUs. We demonstrate that $\\texttt{JaxWildfire}$ achieves 6-35x speedup over existing software and enables gradient-based optimization of simulator parameters. Furthermore, we show that $\\texttt{JaxWildfire}$ can be used to train RL agents to learn wildfire suppression policies.

Effective alignment in such settings requires reward models that are interpretable so that stakeholders can understand and audit model objectives. Moreover, reward models must be capable of steering agents at interaction time, allowing preference shifts to be incorporated without retraining. We introduce ARCANE, a framework that frames alignment as a multi-agent collaboration problem that dynamically represents stakeholder preferences as natural-language rubrics: weighted sets of verifiable criteria that can be generated on-the-fly from task context. Inspired by utility theory, we formulate rubric learning as a reconstruction problem and apply a regularized Group-Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) procedure that balances interpretability, faithfulness, and computational efficiency. Using a corpus of 219 labeled rubrics derived from the GDPVal benchmark, we evaluate ARCANE on challenging tasks requiring multi-step reasoning and tool use. The learned rubrics produce compact, legible evaluations and enable configurable trade-offs (e.g., correctness vs. conciseness) without retraining. Our results show that rubric-based reward models offer a promising path toward interpretable, test-time adaptive alignment for complex, long-horizon AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 ARCANE \uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uc5ec \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc774\ud574\uad00\uacc4\uc790 \uc120\ud638\ub3c4 \uc815\ub82c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc7a5\uae30 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc774 \ubc30\uce58\ub428\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc774\ud574\uad00\uacc4\uc790\uc758 \uc120\ud638\ub3c4\uc640\uc758 \uc815\ub82c \uc720\uc9c0\uac00 \uc911\uc694\ud574\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "ARCANE \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc774\ud574\uad00\uacc4\uc790\uc758 \uc120\ud638\ub97c \uc790\uc5f0 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \uc218\uce58\ub85c \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud45c\ud604\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\ub82c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud611\ub825 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc124\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "219\uac1c\uc758 \ub808\uc774\ube14\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uc218\uce58 \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec ARCANE\uc744 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc5ec, \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \uc218\uce58\uac00 compact\ud558\uace0 \uac00\ub3c5\uc131 \uc788\ub294 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc218\uce58 \uae30\ubc18 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc7a5\uae30 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\ud558\ub294 \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc7a5\uae30 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc774 \ubc30\ud3ec\ub428\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc774\ud574\uad00\uacc4\uc790\uc758 \uc120\ud638\uc640\uc758 \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud574\uc84c\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc815\ub82c\uc740 \uc774\ud574\uad00\uacc4\uc790\uac00 \ubaa8\ub378 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0 \uac10\uc0ac\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uc2dc\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc870\uc815\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc5b4\uc57c \ud558\uba70, \uc120\ud638\ub3c4 \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \uc7ac\ud6c8\ub828 \uc5c6\uc774 \ud1b5\ud569\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc5b4\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud611\ub825 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc124\uc815\ud558\ub294 ARCANE\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc774\ud574\uad00\uacc4\uc790\uc758 \uc120\ud638\ub97c \uc791\uc5c5 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0\uc11c \uc989\uc11d\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uae30\uc900\uc758 \uac00\uc911 \uc9d1\ud569\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud6a8\uc6a9 \uc774\ub860\uc5d0 \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc544, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc218\uce58 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc815\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uace0 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131, \ucda9\uc2e4\ub3c4 \ubc0f \uacc4\uc0b0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\ub294 \uc815\uaddc\ud654\ub41c \uadf8\ub8f9 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4 \uc815\ucc45 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654(GSPO) \uc808\ucc28\ub97c \uc801\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Assessing such behaviour requires methods that capture not only what LLMs output, but the underlying intentions that guide their decisions. In this work, we extend the FAIRGAME framework to systematically evaluate LLM behaviour in repeated social dilemmas through two complementary advances: a payoff-scaled Prisoners Dilemma isolating sensitivity to incentive magnitude, and an integrated multi-agent Public Goods Game with dynamic payoffs and multi-agent histories. These environments reveal consistent behavioural signatures across models and languages, including incentive-sensitive cooperation, cross-linguistic divergence and end-game alignment toward defection. To interpret these patterns, we train traditional supervised classification models on canonical repeated-game strategies and apply them to FAIRGAME trajectories, showing that LLMs exhibit systematic, model- and language-dependent behavioural intentions, with linguistic framing at times exerting effects as strong as architectural differences. Together, these findings provide a unified methodological foundation for auditing LLMs as strategic agents and reveal systematic cooperation biases with direct implications for AI governance, collective decision-making, and the design of safe multi-agent systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 FAIRGAME \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uc5ec \ubc18\ubcf5

To counter this, we introduce CompressARC, a 76K parameter model without any pretraining that solves 20% of evaluation puzzles by minimizing the description length (MDL) of the target puzzle purely during inference time. The MDL endows CompressARC with extreme generalization abilities typically unheard of in deep learning. To our knowledge, CompressARC is the only deep learning method for ARC-AGI where training happens only on a single sample: the target inference puzzle itself, with the final solution information removed. Moreover, CompressARC does not train on the pre-provided ARC-AGI \"training set\". Under these extremely data-limited conditions, we do not ordinarily expect any puzzles to be solvable at all.

In this approach, calibrated noise $\\mathbf{n}\\in\\mathbb{R}^M$ is used to obscure the difference vector $f(\\mathbf{x})-f(\\mathbf{x}')$, where $\\mathbf{x}'$ is known as a neighboring dataset. A DP guarantee is obtained by studying the tail probability bound of a privacy loss random variable (PLRV), defined as the Radon-Nikodym derivative between two distributions. When $\\mathbf{n}$ follows a multivariate Gaussian distribution, the PLRV is characterized as a specific univariate Gaussian. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme to generate $\\mathbf{n}$ by leveraging the fact that the perturbation noise is typically spherically symmetric (i.e., the distribution is rotationally invariant around the origin). The new noise generation scheme allows us to investigate the privacy loss from a geometric perspective and express the resulting PLRV using a product measure, $W\\times U$; measure $W$ is related to a radius random variable controlling the magnitude of $\\mathbf{n}$, while measure $U$ involves a directional random variable governing the angle between $\\mathbf{n}$ and the difference $f(\\mathbf{x})-f(\\mathbf{x}')$. We derive a closed-form moment bound on the product measure to prove $(\u03b5,\u03b4)$-DP. Under the same $(\u03b5,\u03b4)$-DP guarantee, our mechanism yields a smaller expected noise magnitude than the classic Gaussian noise in high dimensions, thereby significantly improving the utility of the noisy result $f(\\mathbf{x})+\\mathbf{n}$.

We recast grounding from a binary judgment into an audit across desiderata, each indexed by an evaluation tuple (context, meaning type, threat model, reference distribution): authenticity (mechanisms reside inside the agent and, for strong claims, were acquired through learning or evolution); preservation (atomic meanings remain intact); faithfulness, both correlational (realized meanings match intended ones) and etiological (internal mechanisms causally contribute to success); robustness (graceful degradation under declared perturbations); compositionality (the whole is built systematically from the parts). We apply this framework to four grounding modes (symbolic; referential; vectorial; relational) and three case studies: model-theoretic semantics achieves exact composition but lacks etiological warrant; large language models show correlational fit and local robustness for linguistic tasks, yet lack selection-for-success on world tasks without grounded interaction; human language meets the desiderata under strong authenticity through evolutionary and developmental acquisition.

Traditional analytical approaches, such as replicator dynamics, often rely on mean-field approximations to remove stochastic effects, but this simplification, whilst able to provide general overall trends, might lead to dissonance between analytical predictions and actual realisations of individual trajectories. In this paper, we propose a novel perspective on MARL systems by modelling them as \\textit{coupled stochastic dynamical systems}, capturing both agent interactions and environmental characteristics. Leveraging tools from dynamical systems theory, we analyse the stability and sensitivity of agent behaviour at individual level, which are key dimensions for their practical deployments, for example, in presence of strict safety requirements. This framework allows us, for the first time, to rigorously study MARL dynamics taking into consideration their inherent stochasticity, providing a deeper understanding of system behaviour and practical insights for the design and control of multi-agent learning processes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654

Despite advances, it is as of yet challenging for existing methodological frameworks to integrate multimodal data for longitudinal personalized forecasting while maintaining interpretability. To address this gap, we present the Neural Koopman Machine (NKM), a new machine learning architecture inspired by dynamical systems and attention mechanisms, designed to forecast multiple cognitive scores simultaneously using multimodal genetic, neuroimaging, proteomic, and demographic data. NKM integrates analytical ($\u03b1$) and biological ($\u03b2$) knowledge to guide feature grouping and control the hierarchical attention mechanisms to extract relevant patterns. By implementing Fusion Group-Aware Hierarchical Attention within the Koopman operator framework, NKM transforms complex nonlinear trajectories into interpretable linear representations. To demonstrate NKM's efficacy, we applied it to study the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. Our results suggest that NKM consistently outperforms both traditional machine learning methods and deep learning models in forecasting trajectories of cognitive decline. Specifically, NKM (1) forecasts changes of multiple cognitive scores simultaneously, (2) quantifies differential biomarker contributions to predicting distinctive cognitive scores, and (3) identifies brain regions most predictive of cognitive deterioration. Together, NKM advances personalized, interpretable forecasting of future cognitive decline in AD using past multimodal data through an explainable, explicit system and reveals potential multimodal biological underpinnings of AD progression.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc54c\uce20\ud558\uc774\uba38\ubcd1\uc758 \uac1c\uc778\uc801\uc778 \uc778\uc9c0 \uac10\uc18c\ub97c \uc608\uce21\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc778 Neural Koopman Machine(NKM)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc54c\uce20\ud558\uc774\uba38\ubcd1\uc758 \ucd08\uae30 \uc778\uc9c0 \uac10\uc18c \uc608\uce21\uc740 \uc9c8\ubcd1 \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc0f \uad00\ub9ac\uc5d0 \uc911\uc2ec\uc801\uc778 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "NKM\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ube44\uc120\ud615 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc120\ud615 \ud45c\ud604\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub294 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc8fc\uc758 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc911 \uc815\ubcf4(\uc720\uc804, \uc2e0\uacbd\uc601\uc0c1, \ub2e8\ubc31\uc9c8\uccb4, \uc778\uad6c\ud1b5\uacc4\ud559)\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud574 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc778\uc9c0 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uad6c\uc870\uc774\ub2e4.", "result": "NKM\uc740 \uc54c\uce20\ud558\uc774\uba38 \uc9c8\ubcd1 \uc2e0\uacbd\uc601\uc0c1 \uc774\ub2c8\uc154\ud2f0\ube0c(ADNI) \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ub41c \uacb0\uacfc, \uae30\uc874 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc0f \ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc778\uc9c0 \uac10\uc18c \uada4\uc801 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0\uc11c \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "NKM\uc740 \uc54c\uce20\ud558\uc774\uba38\ubcd1\uc758 \ubbf8\ub798 \uc778\uc9c0 \uac10\uc18c\ub97c \uac1c\uc778 \ub9de\ucda4\ud615\uc73c\ub85c \uc608\uce21\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uacfc\uac70\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc54c\uce20\ud558\uc774\uba38\ubcd1(AD)\uc5d0\uc11c \uac1c\uc778\uc758 \uc778\uc9c0 \uac10\uc18c\ub97c \uc870\uae30\uc5d0 \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc9c8\ubcd1 \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc0f \uad00\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc9c4\uc804\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc801 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc7a5\uae30\uc801\uc778 \uac1c\uc778 \ub9de\ucda4\ud615 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e4\uc774\ub098\ubbf9 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uacfc \uc8fc\uc758 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc5d0\uc11c \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc740 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc778 Neural Koopman Machine(NKM)\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and edge computing place programmable defenses closest to users and bots, making them natural enforcement points for machine-learning (ML) driven inspection, throttling, and isolation. This survey synthesizes the landscape of AI-enhanced defenses deployed at the edge: (i) anomaly- and behavior-based Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) within broader Web Application and API Protection (WAAP), (ii) adaptive DDoS detection and mitigation, (iii) bot management that resists human-mimicry, and (iv) API discovery, positive security modeling, and encrypted-traffic anomaly analysis. We add a systematic survey method, a threat taxonomy mapped to edge-observable signals, evaluation metrics, deployment playbooks, and governance guidance. We conclude with a research agenda spanning XAI, adversarial robustness, and autonomous multi-agent defense. Our findings indicate that edge-centric AI measurably improves time-to-detect and time-to-mitigate while reducing data movement and enhancing compliance, yet introduces new risks around model abuse, poisoning, and governance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ud604\ub300 \uc6f9 \uc2a4\ud0dd\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c AI \uc9c0\uc6d0 \uacf5\uaca9\uc774 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c4\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uade0\ud615 \ud558\uc5d0 \uc6b4\uc601\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc5e3\uc9c0 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305\uacfc CDN\uc774 \uba38\uc2e0\ub7ec\ub2dd \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\uc5b4\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc640 \ubd07\uc5d0 \uac00\uae5d\uac8c \ubc30\uce58\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uacf5\uaca9\uc758 \uc9c4\ud654\uc640 \uc6f9 \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158, API \ubcf4\ud638\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ubc29\uc5b4 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "\uc5e3\uc9c0\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc30\ud3ec\ub41c AI \uac15\ud654 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc885\ud569\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc0ac\ud588\uc73c\uba70, \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc720\ud615\uc758 \ubc29\ud654\ubcbd, DDoS \ubc29\uc9c0, \ubd07 \uad00\ub9ac \ubc0f API \ubcf4\ud638 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc5e3\uc9c0 \uc911\uc2ec AI\ub294 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ubc0f \uc644\ud654 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc774\ub3d9\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uba70 \uaddc\uc815 \uc900\uc218\ub97c \uac15\ud654\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubaa8\ub378 \ub0a8\uc6a9, \uc624\uc5fc, \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4\uc640 \uad00\ub828\ub41c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "XAI, \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uac15\uac74\uc131 \ubc0f \uc790\uc728 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubc29\uc5b4\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c \uc758\uc81c\ub97c \uc815\ub9bd\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud604\ub300 \uc6f9 \uc2a4\ud0dd\uc740 \ube0c\ub77c\uc6b0\uc800 \uae30\ubc18 \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uacfc API \uc911\uc2ec \ubc31\uc5d4\ub4dc\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc9c0\ubc30\ub418\uba70, \uc774\uc81c \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c AI \uc9c0\uc6d0 \uacf5\uaca9\uc774 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c4\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uade0\ud615\uc774 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ucf58\ud150\uce20 \uc804\uc1a1 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c(CDN)\uc640 \uc5e3\uc9c0 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305\uc740 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubc29\uc5b4\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ubc0f \ubd07\uc5d0 \uac00\uc7a5 \uac00\uae5d\uac8c \ubc30\uce58\ud558\uc5ec \uba38\uc2e0\ub7ec\ub2dd(ML) \uae30\ubc18 \uac80\uc0ac, \uc81c\ud55c \ubc0f \uaca9\ub9ac\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7ec\uc6b4 \uc9d1\ud589 \uc9c0\uc810\uc744 \ub9cc\ub4e0\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc124\ubb38 \uc870\uc0ac\ub294 \uc5e3\uc9c0\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc30\ud3ec\ub41c AI \uac15\ud654 \ubc29\uc5b4\uc758 \uc9c4\ud654\ub97c \uc885\ud569\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70: (i) \ub354 \ub113\uc740 \uc6f9 \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158 \ubc0f API \ubcf4\ud638(WAAP) \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\uc0c1 \ubc0f \ud589\ub3d9 \uae30\ubc18 \uc6f9 \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158 \ubc29\ud654\ubcbd(WAF), (ii) \uc801\uc751\ud615 DDoS \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ubc0f \uc644\ud654, (iii) \uc778\uac04 \ubaa8\ubc29\uc5d0 \uc800\ud56d\ud558\ub294 \ubd07 \uad00\ub9ac, (iv) API \ud0d0\uc9c0, \uae0d\uc815\uc801 \ubcf4\uc548 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \ubc0f \uc554\ud638\ud654\ub41c \ud2b8\ub798\ud53d \uc774\uc0c1 \ubd84\uc11d \ub4f1\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \uc870\uc0ac \ubc29\ubc95, \uc5e3\uc9c0 \uad00\ucc30 \uc2e0\ud638\uc5d0 \ub9e4\ud551\ub41c \uc704\ud611 \ubd84\ub958\ud559, \ud3c9\uac00 \uc9c0\ud45c, \ubc30\ud3ec \ud50c\ub808\uc774\ubd81, \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4 \uc9c0\uce68\uc744 \ucd94\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 XAI, \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uac15\uac74\uc131 \ubc0f \uc790\uc728 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubc29\uc5b4\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \uc5f0\uad6c \uc758\uc81c\ub85c \uacb0\ub860\uc744 \ub9fa\ub294\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc1c\uacac\uc740 \uc5e3\uc9c0 \uc911\uc2ec AI\uac00 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ubc0f \uc644\ud654 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \uce21\uc815 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc774\ub3d9\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uace0 \uaddc\uc815 \uc900\uc218\ub97c \uac15\ud654\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubaa8\ub378 \uc545\uc6a9, \uc624\uc5fc \ubc0f \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4\uc640 \uad00\ub828\ub41c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ubc1c\uc0dd\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b8\ub2e4."}}

This know-how gap limits Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME), where state-of-the-art codes exist but remain cumbersome for non-experts. We address this bottleneck with GENIUS, an AI-agentic workflow that fuses a smart Quantum ESPRESSO knowledge graph with a tiered hierarchy of large language models supervised by a finite-state error-recovery machine. Here we show that GENIUS translates free-form human-generated prompts into validated input files that run to completion on $\\approx$80% of 295 diverse benchmarks, where 76% are autonomously repaired, with success decaying exponentially to a 7% baseline.

One simple method for doing so is to include statements describing beliefs maintained in the prompt space (in what we'll call their belief boxes). But when agents have such statements in belief boxes, how does it actually affect their behaviors and dispositions towards those beliefs? And does it significantly affect agents' ability to be persuasive in multi-agent scenarios? Likewise, if the agents are given instructions to be open-minded, how does that affect their behaviors? We explore these and related questions in a series of experiments. Our findings confirm that instructing agents to be open-minded affects how amenable they are to belief change. We show that incorporating belief statements and their strengths influences an agent's resistance to (and persuasiveness against) opposing viewpoints. Furthermore, it affects the likelihood of belief change, particularly when the agent is outnumbered in a debate by opposing viewpoints, i.e., peer pressure scenarios. The results demonstrate the feasibility and validity of the belief box technique in reasoning and decision-making tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc2e0\ub150\uc774 \ud589\ub3d9 \ubc0f \uc124\ub4dd\ub825\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc801\uc6a9\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ud2b9\uc815\ud55c \uc2e0\ub150\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\ub3c4\ub85d \uc694\uad6c\ub418\ub294 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \ucee4\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc2e0\ub150 \uc0c1\uc790\uc5d0 \uc2e0\ub150\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud558\ub294 \uc9c4\uc220\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub97c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\uac1c\ubc29\uc801\uc778 \ud0dc\ub3c4\ub97c \uc9c0\uc2dc\ubc1b\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc2e0\ub150 \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \ub354 \uc720\uc5f0\ud558\uac8c \ubc18\uc751\ud558\uba70, \uc2e0\ub150 \uc9c4\uc220\uacfc \uadf8 \uac15\ub3c4\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba74 \ubc18\ub300 \uc758\uacac\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc800\ud56d\ub825 \ubc0f \uc124\ub4dd\ub825\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce5c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc2e0\ub150 \uc0c1\uc790 \uae30\ubc95\uc774 \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uc720\ud6a8\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc774 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub428\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uba85\uc81c\uc801 \uc2e0\ub150\uacfc \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uac83\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\ub3c4\ub85d \ud560 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \ucee4\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95 \uc911 \ud558\ub098\ub294 \uadf8\ub4e4\uc758 \uc2e0\ub150 \uc0c1\uc790(\uc2e0\ub150\uc774 \uc720\uc9c0\ub418\ub294 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uacf5\uac04)\uc5d0 \uc2e0\ub150\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud558\ub294 \uc9c4\uc220\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc2e0\ub150 \uc0c1\uc790\uc5d0 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc9c4\uc220\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc744 \ub54c, \uadf8\uac83\uc774 \uc2e4\uc81c\ub85c \uadf8\ub4e4\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9 \ubc0f \uadf8 \uc2e0\ub150\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc131\ud5a5\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub5a4 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294\uac00? \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uc774\uac83\uc774 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc124\ub4dd\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc5d0 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294\uac00? \ub9c8\ucc2c\uac00\uc9c0\ub85c, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uac1c\ubc29\uc801\uc778 \ud0dc\ub3c4\ub97c \uac00\uc9c0\ub3c4\ub85d \uc9c0\uc2dc\ubc1b\uc558\uc744 \ub54c, \uadf8\uac83\uc774 \uadf8\ub4e4\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294\uac00? \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc77c\ub828\uc758 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc9c8\ubb38\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ub41c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud0d0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc1c\uacac\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uac1c\ubc29\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c0\uc2dc\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc2e0\ub150 \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc720\uc5f0\uc131\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce5c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc2e0\ub150 \uc9c4\uc220\uacfc \uadf8 \uac15\ub3c4\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ubc18\ub300 \uc758\uacac\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc800\ud56d\ub825(\ubc0f \uc124\ub4dd\ub825)\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce5c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \ub354 \ub098\uc544\uac00, \uc774\ub294 \ud2b9\ud788 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ub17c\uc7c1\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc18\ub300 \uc758\uacac\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc218\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5f4\uc138\uc77c \ub54c, \uc989 \ub3d9\ub8cc \uc555\ubc15 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e0\ub150 \ubcc0\ud654\uc758 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce5c\ub2e4. \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e0\ub150 \uc0c1\uc790 \uae30\ubc95\uc758 \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uacfc \ud0c0\ub2f9\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

This is because the vast majority of existing methodologies exploit various levels of approximations that lower accuracy and limit the flexibility of kernel and noise-model designs -- an unacceptable drawback at a time when expressive non-stationary kernels are on the rise in many fields. Here, we propose a methodology we term \\emph{gp2Scale} that scales exact Gaussian processes to more than 10 million data points without relying on inducing points, kernel interpolation, or neighborhood-based approximations, and instead leveraging the existing capabilities of a GP: its kernel design. Highly flexible, compactly supported, and non-stationary kernels lead to the identification of naturally occurring sparse structure in the covariance matrix, which is then exploited for the calculations of the linear system solution and the log-determinant for training. We demonstrate our method's functionality on several real-world datasets and compare it with state-of-the-art approximation algorithms. Although we show superior approximation performance in many cases, the method's real power lies in its agnosticism toward arbitrary GP customizations -- core kernel design, noise, and mean functions -- and the type of input space, making it optimally suited for modern Gaussian process applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc815\ud655\ud55c \uac00\uc6b0\uc2dc\uc548 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c

This paper introduces AgenticCyber, a generative AI powered multi-agent system that orchestrates specialized agents to monitor cloud logs, surveillance videos, and environmental audio concurrently. The solution achieves 96.2% F1-score in threat detection, reduces response latency to 420 ms, and enables adaptive security posture management using multimodal language models like Google's Gemini coupled with LangChain for agent orchestration. Benchmark datasets, such as AWS CloudTrail logs, UCF-Crime video frames, and UrbanSound8K audio clips, show greater performance over standard intrusion detection systems, reducing mean time to respond (MTTR) by 65% and improving situational awareness.

Konstantin Rusch"], "title": "Quantifying Memory Use in Reinforcement Learning with Temporal Range", "comment": null, "summary": "How much does a trained RL policy actually use its past observations? We propose \\emph{Temporal Range}, a model-agnostic metric that treats first-order sensitivities of multiple vector outputs across a temporal window to the input sequence as a temporal influence profile and summarizes it by the magnitude-weighted average lag. Temporal Range is computed via reverse-mode automatic differentiation from the Jacobian blocks $\\partial y_s/\\partial x_t\\in\\mathbb{R}^{c\\times d}$ averaged over final timesteps $s\\in\\{t+1,\\dots,T\\}$ and is well-characterized in the linear setting by a small set of natural axioms. Across diagnostic and control tasks (POPGym; flicker/occlusion; Copy-$k$) and architectures (MLPs, RNNs, SSMs), Temporal Range (i) remains small in fully observed control, (ii) scales with the task's ground-truth lag in Copy-$k$, and (iii) aligns with the minimum history window required for near-optimal return as confirmed by window ablations.

This leaves TrustZone-based devices exposed to persistent TEE compromises. We propose Policy-Driven Runtime Integrity Measurement and Attestation (PDRIMA), a runtime integrity protection approach for TrustZone-based TEEs. PDRIMA systematically analyzes TEE attack surfaces and introduces two in-TEE subsystems: a Secure Monitor Agent (SMA) that performs policy-driven measurement, appraisal, logging, and time-based re-measurement over the TEE kernel, static components, user-TAs, and security-critical system calls; and a Remote Attestation Agent (RAA) that aggregates tamper-evident evidence and exposes a remote attestation protocol for verifying.

Yet current evaluation practice, reporting a single accuracy number from a single run, obscures the variance underlying these results, making it impossible to distinguish genuine capability improvements from lucky sampling. We propose adopting Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC), a metric from measurement science, to characterize this variance. ICC decomposes observed variance into between-query variance (task difficulty) and within-query variance (agent inconsistency), highlighting whether reported results reflect true capability or measurement noise. We evaluated on GAIA (Levels 1-3, measuring agentic capabilities across varying reasoning complexity) and FRAMES (measuring retrieval and factuality across multiple documents). We found that ICC varies dramatically with task structure, with reasoning and retrieval tasks (FRAMES) exhibit ICC=0.4955-0.7118 across models, and agentic tasks (GAIA) exhibiting ICC=0.304-0.774 across models. For sub-agent replacement decisions in agentic systems, accuracy improvements are only trustworthy if ICC also improves. We demonstrate that ICC converges by n=8-16 trials for structured tasks and n>=32 for complex reasoning, enabling practitioners to set evidence-based resampling budgets. We recommend reporting accuracy alongside ICC and within-query variance as standard practice, and propose updated Evaluation Cards capturing these metrics.

This research introduces a reinforcement learning technique to learn switching thresholds between two orthogonal navigation policies. Using maze navigation as a case study, this work demonstrates how an agent can dynamically transition between systematic exploration (coverage) and goal-directed pathfinding (convergence) to improve task performance. Unlike fixed-threshold approaches, the agent uses Q-learning to adapt switching behavior based on coverage percentage and distance to goal, requiring only minimal domain knowledge: maze dimensions and target location. The agent does not require prior knowledge of wall positions, optimal threshold values, or hand-crafted heuristics; instead, it discovers effective switching strategies dynamically during each run. The agent discretizes its state space into coverage and distance buckets, then adapts which coverage threshold (20-60\\%) to apply based on observed progress signals. Experiments across 240 test configurations (4 maze sizes from 16$\\times$16 to 128$\\times$128 $\\times$ 10 unique mazes $\\times$ 6 agent variants) demonstrate that adaptive threshold learning outperforms both single-strategy agents and fixed 40\\% threshold baselines. Results show 23-55\\% improvements in completion time, 83\\% reduction in runtime variance, and 71\\% improvement in worst-case scenarios. The learned switching behavior generalizes within each size class to unseen wall configurations. Performance gains scale with problem complexity: 23\\% improvement for 16$\\times$16 mazes, 34\\% for 32$\\times$32, and 55\\% for 64$\\times$64, demonstrating that as the space of possible maze structures grows, the value of adaptive policy selection over fixed heuristics increases proportionally.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744

However, this autonomy creates a largely overlooked security gap. Existing defenses focus on prompt-injection attacks and fail to address threats embedded in tool metadata, leaving MCP-based systems exposed to semantic manipulation. This work analyzes three classes of semantic attacks on MCP-integrated systems: (1) Tool Poisoning, where adversarial instructions are hidden in tool descriptors; (2) Shadowing, where trusted tools are indirectly compromised through contaminated shared context; and (3) Rug Pulls, where descriptors are altered after approval to subvert behavior. To counter these threats, we introduce a layered security framework with three components: RSA-based manifest signing to enforce descriptor integrity, LLM-on-LLM semantic vetting to detect suspicious tool definitions, and lightweight heuristic guardrails that block anomalous tool behavior at runtime. Through evaluation of GPT-4, DeepSeek, and Llama-3.5 across eight prompting strategies, we find that security performance varies widely by model architecture and reasoning method. GPT-4 blocks about 71 percent of unsafe tool calls, balancing latency and safety. DeepSeek shows the highest resilience to Shadowing attacks but with greater latency, while Llama-3.5 is fastest but least robust. Our results show that the proposed framework reduces unsafe tool invocation rates without model fine-tuning or internal modification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubaa8\ub378 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c(MCP)\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc678\ubd80 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ubcf4\uc548 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 MCP \uae30\ubc18 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc720\ud615\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ubc29\uc5b4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ubcf4\uc548 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "MCP\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc678\ubd80 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc640 \ud1b5\ud569\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\ub098, \uc774\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ubcf4\uc548\uc0c1\uc758 \uac04\uacfc\ub41c \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc774 \uc874\uc7ac\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810.", "method": "\uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc720\ud615\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0, RSA \uae30\ubc18 \ub9e4\ub2c8\ud398\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc11c\uba85, LLM-on-LLM \uc758\ubbf8 \uac80\ud1a0, \uacbd\ub7c9 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1 \uac00\ub4dc\ub808\uc77c\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ubcf4\uc548 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "GPT-4\ub294 \uc57d 71%\uc758 \uc548\uc804\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ub3c4\uad6c \ud638\ucd9c\uc744 \ucc28\ub2e8\ud558\uba70, DeepSeek\ub294 Shadowing \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \uac00\uc7a5 \ub192\uc740 \uc800\ud56d\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc774 \ud07c.

These attacks hijack agent behavior by polluting external information sources, exploiting fundamental trade-offs between security and functionality in existing defense mechanisms. This leads to malicious and unauthorized tool invocations, diverting agents from their original objectives. The success of complex IPIs reveals a deeper systemic fragility: while current defenses demonstrate some effectiveness, most defense architectures are inherently fragmented. Consequently, they fail to provide full integrity assurance across the entire task execution pipeline, forcing unacceptable multi-dimensional compromises among security, functionality, and efficiency. Our method is predicated on a core insight: no matter how subtle an IPI attack, its pursuit of a malicious objective will ultimately manifest as a detectable deviation in the action trajectory, distinct from the expected legitimate plan. Based on this, we propose the Cognitive Control Architecture (CCA), a holistic framework achieving full-lifecycle cognitive supervision. CCA constructs an efficient, dual-layered defense system through two synergistic pillars: (i) proactive and preemptive control-flow and data-flow integrity enforcement via a pre-generated \"Intent Graph\"; and (ii) an innovative \"Tiered Adjudicator\" that, upon deviation detection, initiates deep reasoning based on multi-dimensional scoring, specifically designed to counter complex conditional attacks. Experiments on the AgentDojo benchmark substantiate that CCA not only effectively withstands sophisticated attacks that challenge other advanced defense methods but also achieves uncompromised security with notable efficiency and robustness, thereby reconciling the aforementioned multi-dimensional trade-off.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc790\uc728 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uac04\uc811 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc8fc\uc785(IPI) \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8e8\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc778\uc9c0 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98(CCA)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc790\uc728 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 IPI \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\uc5ec, \ubcf4\uc548\uacfc \uae30\ub2a5\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc808\ucda9\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \uc678\ubd80 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc6d0\ucc9c\uc758 \uc624\uc5fc\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc774 \ud0c8\uc120\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ubaa8\ub4e0 IPI \uacf5\uaca9\uc740 \uad81\uadf9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2e4\ud589 \uacc4\ud68d\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud3b8\ucc28\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0a0 \uac83\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uba70, CCA\ub77c\ub294 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "AgentDojo \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c CCA\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc800\ud56d\ud558\uba70, \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uacac\uace0\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ubcf4\uc548\uc774 \uc190\uc0c1\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 CCA\uac00 \ub2e4\ucc28\uc6d0\uc801\uc778 \uc808\ucda9 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc790\uc728 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uac04\uc811 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc8fc\uc785(IPI) \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacf5\uaca9\uc740 \uc678\ubd80 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc18c\uc2a4\ub97c \uc624\uc5fc\uc2dc\ucf1c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud0c8\ucde8\ud558\uba70, \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548\uc131\uacfc \uae30\ub2a5\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc808\ucda9\uc810\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc6d0\ub798 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\ud0c8\ud558\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4dc\ub294 \uc545\uc758\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ubb34\ub2e8\uc758 \ub3c4\uad6c \ud638\ucd9c\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc9d1\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c IPI\uc758 \uc131\uacf5\uc740 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uae4a\uc740 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ubc29\uc5b4\uc218\ub2e8\uc740 \uc5b4\ub290 \uc815\ub3c4\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc774\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub294 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e8\ud3b8\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacb0\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \uadf8\ub4e4\uc740 \uc804\uccb4 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc2e4\ud589 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uc644\uc804\ud55c \ubb34\uacb0\uc131 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uba70, \ubcf4\uc548, \uae30\ub2a5\uc131 \ubc0f \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \uc6a9\ub0a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \ub2e4\ucc28\uc6d0\uc801 \ud0c0\ud611\uc744 \uac15\uc694\ud558\uac8c \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ud575\uc2ec \ud1b5\ucc30\uc5d0 \uae30\ucd08\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uc5bc\ub9c8\ub098 \ubbf8\ubb18\ud55c IPI \uacf5\uaca9\uc774\ub77c\ub3c4 \uadf8 \uc545\uc758\uc801 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc758 \ucd94\uad6c\ub294 \uad81\uadf9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc608\uc0c1\ub41c \uc815\ub2f9\ud55c \uacc4\ud68d\uacfc \uad6c\ubcc4\ub418\ub294 \ud589\ub3d9 \uacbd\ub85c\uc758 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud3b8\ucc28\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0a0 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc804\uccb4 \uc0dd\uc560 \uc8fc\uae30 \uc778\uc9c0 \uac10\ub3c5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 \uc778\uc9c0 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98(CCA)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Although they can enable the learning of complex intelligent behaviors, such task accessories can result in unnatural task setups and hinder long-term performance in the real world. In this work, we explore the challenges of learning without episode terminations and robot embodiment resets using the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm. To learn without terminations, we present a continuing version of the SAC algorithm and show that, with simple modifications to the reward functions of existing tasks, continuing SAC can perform as well as or better than episodic SAC while reducing the sensitivity of performance to the value of the discount rate $\u03b3$. On a modified Gym Reacher task, we investigate possible explanations for the failure of continuing SAC when learning without embodiment resets. Our results suggest that embodiment resets help with exploration of the state space in the SAC algorithm, and removing embodiment resets can lead to poor exploration of the state space and failure of or significantly slower learning. Finally, on additional simulated tasks and a real-robot vision task, we show that increasing the entropy of the policy when performance trends worse or remains static is an effective intervention for recovering the performance lost due to not using embodiment resets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc5d0\ud53c\uc18c\ub4dc \uc885\ub8cc\uc640 \ub85c\ubd07 \uc2e0\uccb4 \ub9ac\uc14b

While individual large language models can summarize alerts or interpret unstructured reports, they fall short in real SOC environments that require grounded data access, reproducibility, and accountable workflows. In response, the field has seen a rapid architectural evolution from single-model helpers toward tool-augmented agents, distributed multi-agent systems, schema-bound tool ecosystems, and early explorations of semi-autonomous investigative pipelines. This survey presents a five-generation taxonomy of agentic AI in cybersecurity. It traces how capabilities and risks change as systems advance from text-only LLM reasoners to multi-agent collaboration frameworks and constrained-autonomy pipelines. We compare these generations across core dimensions - reasoning depth, tool use, memory, reproducibility, and safety. In addition, we also synthesize emerging benchmarks used to evaluate cyber-oriented agents. Finally, we outline the unresolved challenges that accompany this evolution, such as response validation, tool-use correctness, multi-agent coordination, long-horizon reasoning, and safeguards for high-impact actions. Collectively, this work provides a structured perspective on how agentic AI is taking shape within cybersecurity and what is required to ensure its safe and reliable deployment.", "AI": {"tldr":

However, existing LLM agents primarily follow a reactive paradigm, relying on explicit user instructions to initiate services, which increases both physical and cognitive workload. In this paper, we propose ProAgent, the first end-to-end proactive agent system that harnesses massive sensory contexts and LLM reasoning to deliver proactive assistance. ProAgent first employs a proactive-oriented context extraction approach with on-demand tiered perception to continuously sense the environment and derive hierarchical contexts that incorporate both sensory and persona cues. ProAgent then adopts a context-aware proactive reasoner to map these contexts to user needs and tool calls, providing proactive assistance. We implement ProAgent on Augmented Reality (AR) glasses with an edge server and extensively evaluate it on a real-world testbed, a public dataset, and through a user study. Results show that ProAgent achieves up to 33.4% higher proactive prediction accuracy, 16.8% higher tool-calling F1 score, and notable improvements in user satisfaction over state-of-the-art baselines, marking a significant step toward proactive assistants.

However, traditional RMABs assume independence among arms, limiting their ability to account for interactions between individuals that can be common and significant in a real-world environment. This paper introduces Networked RMAB, a novel framework that integrates the RMAB model with the independent cascade model to capture interactions between arms in networked environments. We define the Bellman equation for networked RMAB and present its computational challenge due to exponentially large action and state spaces. To resolve the computational challenge, we establish the submodularity of Bellman equation and apply the hill-climbing algorithm to achieve a $1-\\frac{1}{e}$ approximation guarantee in Bellman updates. Lastly, we prove that the approximate Bellman updates are guaranteed to converge by a modified contraction analysis. We experimentally verify these results by developing an efficient Q-learning algorithm tailored to the networked setting. Experimental results on real-world graph data demonstrate that our Q-learning approach outperforms both $k$-step look-ahead and network-blind approaches, highlighting the importance of capturing and leveraging network effects where they exist.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub86d\uace0 \uac15\ub825\ud55c RMAB \ubaa8\ub378, \uc989 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c RMAB\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc790\uc6d0 \ud560\ub2f9 \ubc0f \uac1c\uc785 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 RMAB\ub294 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc131\uc744 \uac00\uc815\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ud604\uc2e4 \uc138\uacc4\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ubc18\uc601\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc544 \ud55c\uacc4\uac00 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c RMAB \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801 \uce90\uc2a4\ucf00\uc774\ub4dc \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec Bellman \ubc29\uc815\uc2dd\uc744 \uc815\uc758\ud558\uace0, \uacc4\uc0b0\uc801 \ub3c4\uc804\uc5d0 \ub300\uc751\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc11c\ube0c\ubaa8\ub4c8\ub7ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uace0 \ud790 \ud074\ub9ac\ubc0d \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "Q-learning \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uc600\uace0, \uc2e4\uc81c \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c $k$-step look-ahead \ubc0f \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ube14\ub77c\uc778\ub4dc \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uace0 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "Restless Multi-Armed Bandits (RMABs)\ub294 sequential decision-making\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uacf5\uacf5 \uac74\uac15 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc790\uc6d0 \ud560\ub2f9 \ubc0f \uac1c\uc785 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub110\ub9ac \uc751\uc6a9\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 RMAB\ub294 \ud314 \uac04\uc758 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc131\uc744 \uac00\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\uc81c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uac1c\uc778 \uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ud314 \uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 RMAB \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801 \uce90\uc2a4\ucf00\uc774\ub4dc \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c RMAB\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c RMAB\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c Bellman \ubc29\uc815\uc2dd\uc744 \uc815\uc758\ud558\uace0, \uae30\ud558\uae09\uc218\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud070 \ud589\ub3d9 \ubc0f \uc0c1\ud0dc \uacf5\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uacc4\uc0b0\uc801 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacc4\uc0b0\uc801 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 Bellman \ubc29\uc815\uc2dd\uc758 \uc11c\ube0c\ubaa8\ub4c8\ub7ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\ub97c \uc124\uc815\ud558\uace0 \ud790 \ud074\ub9ac\ubc0d \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec Bellman \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c $1-\frac{1}{e}$\uc758 \uadfc\uc0ac \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c, \uc218\uc815\ub41c \uc218\ucd95 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uadfc\uc0ac Bellman \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\uac00 \uc218\ub834\ud560 \uac83\uc784\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \ub9de\uac8c \uc870\uc815\ub41c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 Q-learning \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\uc81c \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 Q-learning \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 $k$-step look-ahead \ubc0f \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ube14\ub77c\uc778\ub4dc \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ubaa8\ub450 \ucd08\uc6d4\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uace0 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud568\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Moreover, directly migrating these frameworks to local small-scale models (LSMs) offers a suboptimal solution with catastrophic collapse in utility based on our core findings. Our work argues that this failure stems not merely from the capability deficits of LSMs, but from the inherent irrationality of the greedy adversarial strategies employed by current state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods. We model the anonymization process as a trade-off between Marginal Privacy Gain (MPG) and Marginal Utility Cost (MUC), and demonstrate that greedy strategies inevitably drift into an irrational state. To address this, we propose Rational Localized Adversarial Anonymization (RLAA), a fully localized and training-free framework featuring an Attacker-Arbitrator-Anonymizer (A-A-A) architecture. RLAA introduces an arbitrator that acts as a rationality gatekeeper, validating the attacker's inference to filter out feedback providing negligible benefits on privacy preservation.

The prevailing practice is to leverage LLMs for log-based failure localization, attributing errors to a specific agent and step. However, this paradigm has two key limitations: (i) log-only debugging lacks validation, producing untested hypotheses, and (ii) single-step or single-agent attribution is often ill-posed, as we find that multiple distinct interventions can independently repair the failed task. To address the first limitation, we introduce DoVer, an intervention-driven debugging framework, which augments hypothesis generation with active verification through targeted interventions (e.g., editing messages, altering plans). For the second limitation, rather than evaluating on attribution accuracy, we focus on measuring whether the system resolves the failure or makes quantifiable progress toward task success, reflecting a more outcome-oriented view of debugging. Within the Magnetic-One agent framework, on the datasets derived from GAIA and AssistantBench, DoVer flips 18-28% of failed trials into successes, achieves up to 16% milestone progress, and validates or refutes 30-60% of failure hypotheses. DoVer also performs effectively on a different dataset (GSMPlus) and agent framework (AG2), where it recovers 49% of failed trials. These results highlight intervention as a practical mechanism for improving reliability in agentic systems and open opportunities for more robust, scalable debugging methods for LLM-based multi-agent systems.

IEEE conference-style format", "summary": "Understanding the dynamic reorganization of brain networks is critical for predicting cognitive decline, neurological progression, and individual variability in clinical outcomes. This work proposes a multimodal graph neural network framework that integrates structural MRI, diffusion tensor imaging, and functional MRI to model spatiotemporal brain network reorganization. Brain regions are represented as nodes and structural and functional connectivity as edges, forming longitudinal brain graphs for each subject. Temporal evolution is captured via fractional stochastic differential operators embedded within graph-based recurrent networks, enabling the modeling of long-term dependencies and stochastic fluctuations in network dynamics. Attention mechanisms fuse multimodal information and generate interpretable biomarkers, including network energy entropy, graph curvature, fractional memory indices, and modality-specific attention scores. These biomarkers are combined into a composite prognostic index to quantify individual risk of network instability or cognitive decline. Experiments on longitudinal neuroimaging datasets demonstrate both predictive accuracy and interpretability. The results highlight the potential of mathematically rigorous, multimodal graph-based approaches for deriving clinically meaningful biomarkers from existing imaging data without requiring new data collection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911\ubaa8\ub4dc \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \ub1cc \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \uc2dc\uacf5\uac04 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc778\uc9c0 \uc800\ud558 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub1cc \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc778\uc9c0 \uc800\ud558 \ubc0f \uc784\uc0c1 \uacb0\uacfc\uc758 \uac1c\uc778 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uad6c\uc870\uc801 MRI, \ud655\uc0b0 \ud150\uc11c \uc774\ubbf8\uc9d5, \uae30\ub2a5\uc801 MRI\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911\ubaa8\ub4dc \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \ub1cc \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e0\uacbd\uc601\uc0c1 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc640 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \uc785\uc99d\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9d5 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uc784\uc0c1\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc758\ubbf8 \uc788\ub294 \ubc14\uc774\uc624\ub9c8\ucee4\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc218\ud559\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5c4\ubc00\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911\ubaa8\ub4dc \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uae30\ubc18 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub1cc \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc7ac\ud3b8\uc131\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc778\uc9c0 \uc800\ud558, \uc2e0\uacbd\ud559\uc801 \uc9c4\ud589 \ubc0f \uc784\uc0c1 \uacb0\uacfc\uc758 \uac1c\uc778\uc801 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 MRI, \ud655\uc0b0 \ud150\uc11c \uc774\ubbf8\uc9d5 \ubc0f \uae30\ub2a5\uc801 MRI\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uacf5\uac04\uc801 \ubc0f \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \ub1cc \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uc7ac\ud3b8\uc131\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911\ubaa8\ub4dc \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub1cc \uc601\uc5ed\uc740 \ub178\ub4dc\ub85c \ud45c\ud604\ub418\uace0 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ubc0f \uae30\ub2a5\uc801 \uc5f0\uacb0\uc740 \uc5e3\uc9c0\ub85c \ud45c\ud604\ub418\uc5b4, \uac01 \ud53c\ud5d8\uc790\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc7a5\uae30\uc801\uc778 \ub1cc \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \ud615\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \uc9c4\ud654\ub294 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uae30\ubc18 \uc21c\ud658\ub9dd\uc5d0 \ub0b4\uc7a5\ub41c \ubd84\uc218 \ud655\ub960 \ubbf8\ubd84 \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc790\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud3ec\ucc29\ub418\uc5b4, \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc5d0\uc11c \uc7a5\uae30\uc801\uc778 \uc885\uc18d\uc131\uacfc \ud655\ub960\uc801 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc8fc\uc758 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911\ubaa8\ub4dc \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc735\ud569\ud558\uace0 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c, \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uace1\ub960, \ubd84\uc218 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc9c0\uc218 \ubc0f \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc8fc\uc758 \uc810\uc218\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubc14\uc774\uc624\ub9c8\ucee4\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc14\uc774\uc624\ub9c8\ucee4\ub294 \uac1c\ubcc4 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ubd88\uc548\uc815\uc131\uc774\ub098 \uc778\uc9c0 \uc800\ud558\uc758 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubcf5\ud569 \uc608\uce21 \uc9c0\uc218\ub85c \uacb0\ud569\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc7a5\uae30\uc801\uc778 \uc2e0\uacbd\uc601\uc0c1 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc640 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9d5 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc218\uc9d1 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc784\uc0c1\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc758\ubbf8 \uc788\ub294 \ubc14\uc774\uc624\ub9c8\ucee4\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc218\ud559\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5c4\ubc00\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911\ubaa8\ub4dc \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uae30\ubc18 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Knowledge graphs, by contrast, offer a structured representation of entities and relations, enabling richer intermediate abstractions of contract code and supporting the use of graph query languages to identify rule-violating elements. This paper presents CKG-LLM, a framework for detecting access-control vulnerabilities in smart contracts. Leveraging the reasoning and code generation capabilities of large language models, CKG-LLM translates natural-language vulnerability patterns into executable queries over contract knowledge graphs to automatically locate vulnerable code elements. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that CKG-LLM achieves superior performance in detecting access-control vulnerabilities compared to existing tools. Finally, we discuss potential extensions of CKG-LLM as part of future research directions.", "AI": {"tldr": "CKG-LLM\uc740 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uacc4\uc57d\uc5d0\uc11c \uc811\uadfc \uc81c\uc5b4 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uae30\uc874 \ub3c4\uad6c\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uacc4\uc57d \ubd84\uc11d \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc758\ubbf8 \uad6c\uc870 \ubc0f \uc81c\uc5b4 \ub17c\ub9ac\ub97c \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4\ub2e4.", "method": "CKG-LLM\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \uacc4\uc57d \uc9c0\uc2dd \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ucffc\ub9ac\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "CKG-LLM\uc740 \uae30\uc874 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub4e4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc811\uadfc \uc81c\uc5b4 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "CKG-LLM\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \ud655\uc7a5\uc744 \ub17c\uc758\ud558\uba70 \ud5a5\ud6c4 \uc5f0\uad6c \ubc29\ud5a5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc774\uc57c\uae30\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uacc4\uc57d \ubd84\uc11d \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ucd94\uc0c1 \uad6c\ubb38 \ud2b8\ub9ac, \uc81c\uc5b4 \ud750\ub984 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ub610\ub294 \uc815\uc801 \ub2e8\uc77c \ud560\ub2f9 \ud615\uc2dd\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc911\uac04 \ud45c\ud604\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc758\ubbf8 \uad6c\uc870\uc640 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ub17c\ub9ac\ub97c \ubaa8\ub450 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud55c\uacc4\uac00 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubc18\uba74, \uc9c0\uc2dd \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub294 \uc5d4\ud2f0\ud2f0\uc640 \uad00\uacc4\uc758 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc5ec \uacc4\uc57d \ucf54\ub4dc\uc758 \ub354 \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \uc911\uac04 \ucd94\uc0c1\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uace0, \uaddc\uce59\uc744 \uc704\ubc18\ud558\ub294 \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ucffc\ub9ac \uc5b8\uc5b4\uc758 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uacc4\uc57d\uc5d0\uc11c \uc811\uadfc \uc81c\uc5b4 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 CKG-LLM\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, their ability to plan over long horizons is limited by the effective memory span of the backbone architecture. This limitation leads to perceptual drift in long rollouts, hindering the model's capacity to perform loop closures within imagined trajectories. In this work, we investigate the effective memory span of transformer-based world models through an analysis of several memory augmentation mechanisms. We introduce a taxonomy that distinguishes between memory encoding and memory injection mechanisms, motivating their roles in extending the world model's memory through the lens of residual stream dynamics. Using a state recall evaluation task, we measure the memory recall of each mechanism and analyze its respective trade-offs. Our findings show that memory mechanisms improve the effective memory span in vision transformers and provide a path to completing loop closures within a world model's imagination.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30 \uae30\ubc18 \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ubc94\uc704\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uace0 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc99d\uac15 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc758 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uae30\uc5b5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud68c\uc0c1 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ubc94\uc704\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uc5ec \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc5ec\ub7ec \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc99d\uac15 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc778\ucf54\ub529\uacfc \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc8fc\uc785 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uad6c\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \ubd84\ub958\ubc95\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uac01 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc758 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ud68c\uc0c1\uc744 \uce21\uc815\ud558\uace0 \uac01\uac01\uc758 \ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ub4dc \uc624\ud504\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774 \uc2dc\uac01 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ubc94\uc704\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0 \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc0c1\uc0c1\uc758 \ub8e8\ud504 \ub2eb\uae30\ub97c \uc644\ub8cc\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uacfc\uac70 \uad00\uce21\uce58 \ubc0f \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc870\uac74\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uc5ec \ubbf8\ub798 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \uc608\uce21\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc0c1\uc0c1\ub41c \ud658\uacbd \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uacc4\ud68d\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae34 \uacc4\ud68d \uc218\ub9bd\uc2dc \uc774\ub4e4\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825\uc740 \ubc31\ubcf8 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uae30\uc5b5 \ubc94\uc704\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc81c\ud55c\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\uc740 \uae34 \ub864\uc544\uc6c3\uc5d0\uc11c \uac10\uac01\uc801\uc778 \ub4dc\ub9ac\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc0c1\uc0c1\ub41c \uacbd\ub85c \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ub8e8\ud504 \ub2eb\uae30\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc800\ud574\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc99d\uac15 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30 \uae30\ubc18 \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ubc94\uc704\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc794\uc5ec \uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9bc \uc5ed\ud559\uc758 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\ub97c \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ub3d9\uae30\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc778\ucf54\ub529 \ubc0f \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc8fc\uc785 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998 \uac04\uc758 \uad6c\ubcc4\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc0c1\ud0dc \ud68c\uc0c1 \ud3c9\uac00\ub294 \uac01\uac01\uc758 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc758 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ud68c\uc0c1\uc744 \uce21\uc815\ud558\uace0 \ud574\ub2f9\ud558\ub294 \ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ub4dc \uc624\ud504\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc1c\uacac\uc740 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774 \ube44\uc804 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ubc94\uc704\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0 \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc0c1\uc0c1 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ub8e8\ud504 \ub2eb\uae30\ub97c \uc644\ub8cc\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

This paper presents an analysis of the goal-conditioned setting based on optimal control. In particular, we derive an optimality gap between more classical, often quadratic, objectives and the goal-conditioned reward, elucidating the success of goal-conditioned RL and why classical ``dense'' rewards can falter. We then consider the partially observed Markov decision setting and connect state estimation to our probabilistic reward, further making the goal-conditioned reward well suited to dual control problems. The advantages of goal-conditioned policies are validated on nonlinear and uncertain environments using both RL and predictive control techniques.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubaa9\ud45c \uc870\uac74 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ubd84\uc11d \ubc0f \uace0\uc804\uc801 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uacfc\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801\uc131 \ucc28\uc774 \ub17c\uc758.", "motivation": "\ubaa9\ud45c \uc870\uac74 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc774 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0 \ub3c4\ub2ec\ud560 \ud655\ub960\uc744 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8ec\ub2e4.", "method": "\uace0\uc804\uc801\uc778 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc640 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc870\uac74 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uac04\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801\uc131 \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uace0, \ubd80\ubd84 \uad00\ucc30 \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uc124\uc815\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud558\uc5ec \uc0c1\ud0dc \ucd94\uc815\uacfc \ud655\ub960\uc801 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \uc5f0\uacb0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ube44\uc120\ud615 \ubc0f \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa9\ud45c \uc870\uac74 \uc815\ucc45\uc758 \uc7a5\uc810\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubaa9\ud45c \uc870\uac74 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc774 \uc30d\ubc29\ud5a5 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc798 \ub9de\ucd94\uc5b4\uc9c4\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubaa9\ud45c \uc870\uac74 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828\uc2dc\ucf1c \ubaa9\ud45c \ubaa9\ud45c \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0 \ub3c4\ub2ec\ud560 \ud655\ub960\uc744 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\uc640 \uad00\ub828\ub41c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ucd5c\uc801 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \ubaa9\ud45c \uc870\uac74 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uace0\uc804\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc885\uc885 \uc774\ucc28\uc801\uc778 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc640 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc870\uac74 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uac04\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801\uc131 \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa9\ud45c \uc870\uac74 RL\uc758 \uc131\uacf5 \uc774\uc720\uc640 \uace0\uc804\uc801\uc778 '\ubc00\ub3c4' \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc774 \uc65c \uc2e4\ud328\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc124\uba85\ud55c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7f0 \ub2e4\uc74c, \ubd80\ubd84 \uad00\ucc30 \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uc124\uc815\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud558\uace0, \uc0c1\ud0dc \ucd94\uc815\uc744 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uacfc \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa9\ud45c \uc870\uac74 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc774 \uc30d\ubc29\ud5a5 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc798 \uc801\ud569\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ub9cc\ub4e0\ub2e4. \ubaa9\ud45c \uc870\uac74 \uc815\ucc45\uc758 \uc7a5\uc810\uc740 \ube44\uc120\ud615 \ubc0f \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c RL\uacfc \uc608\uce21 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac80\uc99d\ub41c\ub2e4."}}

However, this paradigm revives the classic cybersecurity challenges of agency and authorization in a novel and volatile context. As decision-making shifts from deterministic code logic to probabilistic inference driven by natural language, traditional security mechanisms designed for deterministic behavior fail. It is fundamentally challenging to establish trust for unpredictable AI agents and to enforce the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP) when instructions are ambiguous. Despite the escalating threat landscape, the academic community's understanding of this emerging domain remains fragmented, lacking a systematic framework to analyze its root causes. This paper provides a unifying formal lens for agent-interaction security.\n  We observed that most security threats in this domain stem from a fundamental mismatch between trust evaluation and authorization policies. We introduce a novel risk analysis model centered on this trust-authorization gap. Using this model as a unifying lens, we survey and classify the implementation paths of existing, often seemingly isolated, attacks and defenses. This new framework not only unifies the field but also allows us to identify critical research gaps. Finally, we leverage our analysis to suggest a systematic research direction toward building robust, trusted agents and dynamic authorization mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4

This project develops an AI system offering the only end-to-end solution by aiding doctors with both diagnosis and treatment planning. In the diagnosis phase, a sequential decision-making framework consisting of 4 classification models (Convolutional Neural Networks and Support Vector Machine) are used. Each model progressively classifies the patient's brain into increasingly specific categories, with the final step being named diagnosis. For treatment planning, an RL system consisting of 3 generative models is used. First, the resection model (diffusion model) analyzes the diagnosed GBM MRI and predicts a possible resection outcome. Second, the radiotherapy model (Spatio-Temporal Vision Transformer) generates an MRI of the brain's progression after a user-defined number of weeks. Third, the chemotherapy model (Diffusion Model) produces the post-treatment MRI. A survival rate calculator (Convolutional Neural Network) then checks if the generated post treatment MRI has a survival rate within 15% of the user defined target. If not, a feedback loop using proximal policy optimization iterates over this system until an optimal resection location is identified. When compared to existing solutions, this project found 3 key findings: (1) Using a sequential decision-making framework consisting of 4 small diagnostic models reduced computing costs by 22.28x, (2) Transformers regression capabilities decreased tumor progression inference time by 113 hours, and (3) Applying Augmentations resembling Real-life situations improved overall DICE scores by 2.9%.

As the core component of the train operation system, the health of bearings is directly related to the safety of train operation. The traditional diagnostic methods are facing the challenge of insufficient diagnostic accuracy under complex conditions. To solve these problems, we propose a novel Neural Factorization-based Classification (NFC) framework for bearing fault diagnosis. It is built on two core idea: 1) Embedding vibration time series into multiple mode-wise latent feature vectors to capture diverse fault-related patterns; 2) Leveraging neural factorization principles to fuse these vectors into a unified vibration representation. This design enables effective mining of complex latent fault characteristics from raw time-series data. We further instantiate the framework with two models CP-NFC and Tucker-NFC based on CP and Tucker fusion schemes, respectively. Experimental results show that both models achieve superior diagnostic performance compared with traditional machine learning methods. The comparative analysis provides valuable empirical evidence and practical guidance for selecting effective diagnostic strategies in high-speed train bearing monitoring.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uace0\uc18d \uc5f4\ucc28\uc758 \ubca0\uc5b4\ub9c1 \uacb0\ud568 \uc9c4\ub2e8\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uba70, \uc9c4\ub2e8 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub192\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc2e0\uacbd \uc778\uc218 \uae30\ubc18 \ubd84\ub958(NFC) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uace0\uc18d \uc5f4\ucc28\uc758 \ubca0\uc5b4\ub9c1\uc740 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \uc6b4\ud589\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud558\uba70 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc9c4\ub2e8 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc870\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "NFC \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc9c4\ub3d9 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\ub97c \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubaa8\ub4dc\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac \ud2b9\uc131 \ubca1\ud130\ub85c \uc784\ubca0\ub529\ud558\uace0, \uc2e0\uacbd \uc778\uc218 \uc6d0\ub9ac\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 \ubca1\ud130\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "CP-NFC \ubc0f Tucker-NFC \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc81c\uc548\ub418\uc5b4 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc9c4\ub2e8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ubd84\uc11d \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uace0\uc18d\uc5f4\ucc28 \ubca0\uc5b4\ub9c1 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc9c4\ub2e8 \uc804\ub7b5 \uc120\ud0dd\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uac00\uc774\ub4dc\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uace0\uc18d \uc5f4\ucc28\uc758 \ubca0\uc5b4\ub9c1 \uacb0\ud568 \uc9c4\ub2e8\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5f4\ucc28 \uc6b4\ud589 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\uc778 \ubca0\uc5b4\ub9c1\uc758 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub294 \uc5f4\ucc28 \uc6b4\ud589\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uacfc \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad00\ub828\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc9c4\ub2e8 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc870\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd88\ucda9\ubd84\ud55c \uc9c4\ub2e8 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc758 \ub3c4\uc804\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubca0\uc5b4\ub9c1 \uacb0\ud568 \uc9c4\ub2e8\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc2e0\uacbd \uc778\uc218 \uae30\ubc18 \ubd84\ub958(NFC) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud575\uc2ec \uc774\ub150\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uc5ec \uad6c\ucd95\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4: 1) \uc9c4\ub3d9 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\ub97c \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubaa8\ub4dc\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac \ud2b9\uc131 \ubca1\ud130\ub85c \uc784\ubca0\ub529\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uacb0\ud568 \uad00\ub828 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uace0; 2) \uc2e0\uacbd \uc778\uc218 \uc6d0\ub9ac\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubca1\ud130\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ub41c \uc9c4\ub3d9 \ud45c\ud604\uc73c\ub85c \uc735\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc124\uacc4\ub294 \uc6d0\uc2dc \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\ub9ac\uc988 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc7a0\uc7ac \uacb0\ud568 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 CP \ubc0f Tucker \uc735\ud569 \uccb4\uacc4\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c CP-NFC \ubc0f Tucker-NFC \ub450 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uad6c\uccb4\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ub450 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc9c4\ub2e8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ube44\uad50 \ubd84\uc11d\uc740 \uace0\uc18d \uc5f4\ucc28 \ubca0\uc5b4\ub9c1 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc9c4\ub2e8 \uc804\ub7b5 \uc120\ud0dd\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uadc0\uc911\ud55c \uc2e4\uc99d\uc801 \uc99d\uac70\uc640 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uc9c0\uce68\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Yet the susceptibility of modern smartphones to physical side-channel analysis (SCA) is underexplored, with recent work limited to pre-2019 hardware. Since then, smartphone system on chip (SoC) platforms have grown more complex, with heterogeneous processor clusters, sub 10 nm nodes, and frequencies over 2 GHz, potentially complicating SCA. In this paper, we assess the feasibility of electromagnetic (EM) SCA on a Raspberry Pi 4, featuring a Broadcom BCM2711 SoC and a Fairphone 4 featuring a Snapdragon 750G 5G SoC. Using new attack methodologies tailored to modern SoCs, we recover ECDSA secrets from OpenSSL by mounting the Nonce@Once attack of Alam et al.

Submitted to AMIA 2026 Informatics Summit Student Paper Track", "summary": "Heart failure (HF) is one of the leading causes of rehospitalization among older adults in the United States. Although clinical notes contain rich, detailed patient information and make up a large portion of electronic health records (EHRs), they remain underutilized for HF readmission risk analysis. Traditional computational models for HF readmission often rely on expert-crafted rules, medical thesauri, and ontologies to interpret clinical notes, which are typically written under time pressure and may contain misspellings, abbreviations, and domain-specific jargon. We present ClinNoteAgents, an LLM-based multi-agent framework that transforms free-text clinical notes into (1) structured representations of clinical and social risk factors for association analysis and (2) clinician-style abstractions for HF 30-day readmission prediction. We evaluate ClinNoteAgents on 3,544 notes from 2,065 patients (readmission rate=35.16%), demonstrating strong performance in extracting risk factors from free-text, identifying key contributing factors, and predicting readmission risk. By reducing reliance on structured fields and minimizing manual annotation and model training, ClinNoteAgents provides a scalable and interpretable approach to note-based HF readmission risk modeling in data-limited healthcare systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "ClinNoteAgents\ub294 \uc790\uc720 \ud615\uc2dd\uc758 \uc784\uc0c1 \ub178\ud2b8\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc5ec \uc2ec\ubd80\uc804 \uc7ac\uc785\uc6d0 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubbf8\uad6d\uc758 \ub178\uc778\ub4e4 \uac00\uc6b4\ub370 \uc2ec\ubd80\uc804\uc740 \uc7ac\uc785\uc6d0\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc6d0\uc778 \uc911 \ud558\ub098\uc774\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc784\uc0c1 \ub178\ud2b8\ub294 \uc2ec\ubd80\uc804 \uc7ac\uc785\uc6d0 \uc704\ud5d8 \ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \ud65c\uc6a9\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "ClinNoteAgents\ub294 \uc790\uc720 \ud615\uc2dd\uc758 \uc784\uc0c1 \ub178\ud2b8\ub97c \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc784\uc0c1 \ubc0f \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uc704\ud5d8 \uc694\uc778 \ud45c\ud604\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\uace0, \uc2ec\ubd80\uc804 30\uc77c \uc7ac\uc785\uc6d0 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc758\uc0ac \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c\uc758 \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "result": "34,544\uac1c\uc758 \ub178\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, \uc790\uc720 \ud615\uc2dd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc704\ud5d8 \uc694\uc778\uc744 \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\uace0 \uc8fc\uc694 \uae30\uc5ec \uc694\uc778\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uba70 \uc7ac\uc785\uc6d0 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "ClinNoteAgents\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ud544\ub4dc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc758\uc874\ub3c4\ub97c \uc904\uc774\uace0 \uc218\ub3d9 \uc8fc\uc11d \ubc0f \ubaa8\ub378 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc758\ub8cc \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub178\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \uc2ec\ubd80\uc804 \uc7ac\uc785\uc6d0 \uc704\ud5d8 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc2ec\ubd80\uc804(HF)\uc740 \ubbf8\uad6d\uc5d0\uc11c \ub178\uc778\uc758 \uc7ac\uc785\uc6d0\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc6d0\uc778 \uc911 \ud558\ub098\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc784\uc0c1 \ub178\ud2b8\ub294 \ud48d\ubd80\ud558\uace0 \uc0c1\uc138\ud55c \ud658\uc790 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ub2f4\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70 \uc804\uc790 \uac74\uac15 \uae30\ub85d(EHR)\uc758 \ud070 \ubd80\ubd84\uc744 \ucc28\uc9c0\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc2ec\ubd80\uc804 \uc7ac\uc785\uc6d0 \uc704\ud5d8 \ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \ud65c\uc6a9\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2ec\ubd80\uc804 \uc7ac\uc785\uc6d0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2dc\uac04 \uc81c\uc57d \ud558\uc5d0 \uc791\uc131\ub41c \uc784\uc0c1 \ub178\ud2b8\ub97c \ud574\uc11d\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uac00 \uc791\uc131\ud55c \uaddc\uce59, \uc758\ub8cc \uc720\uc758\uc5b4\uc9d1 \ubc0f \uc628\ud1a8\ub85c\uc9c0\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc790\uc720 \ud615\uc2dd\uc758 \uc784\uc0c1 \ub178\ud2b8\ub97c (1) \uc5f0\uad00 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc784\uc0c1 \ubc0f \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uc704\ud5d8 \uc694\uc778\uc758 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ud45c\ud604\uc73c\ub85c, (2) \uc2ec\ubd80\uc804 30\uc77c \uc7ac\uc785\uc6d0 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc758\uc0ac \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c\uc758 \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 ClinNoteAgents\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 2,065\uba85\uc758 \ud658\uc790(\uc7ac\uc785\uc6d0\uc728=35.16%)\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 3,544\uac1c\uc758 \ub178\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec ClinNoteAgents\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc5ec, \uc790\uc720 \ud615\uc2dd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc704\ud5d8 \uc694\uc778\uc744 \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\uace0 \uc8fc\uc694 \uae30\uc5ec \uc694\uc778\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uba70 \uc7ac\uc785\uc6d0 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

We introduce a novel framework that ranks entire trajectories by defining and aggregating a new state-importance metric. This metric combines the classic Q-value difference with a \"radical term\" that captures the agent's affinity to reach its goal, providing a more nuanced measure of state criticality. We demonstrate that our method successfully identifies optimal trajectories from a heterogeneous collection of agent experiences. Furthermore, by generating counterfactual rollouts from critical states within these trajectories, we show that the agent's chosen path is robustly superior to alternatives, thereby providing a powerful \"Why this, and not that?\" explanation. Our experiments in standard OpenAI Gym environments validate that our proposed importance metric is more effective at identifying optimal behaviors compared to classic approaches, offering a significant step towards trustworthy autonomous systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc124\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc7a5\uae30\uc801\uc778 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uada4\uc801 \uc218\uc900\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc5ec \uc124\uba85\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud22c\uba85\ud558\uace0 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud589\ub3d9 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc774 \uc911\ub300\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc911\uc694\uc131 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc744 \uc815\uc758\ud558\uace0 \uc9d1\uacc4\ud558\uc5ec \uc804\uccb4 \uada4\uc801\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uacbd\ud5d8 \ubaa8\uc74c\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc801 \uada4\uc801\uc744 \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc911\uc694\uc131 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc740 \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub354 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc774 \ubc30\uce58\ub428\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \uadf8 \ud589\ub3d9\uc774 \ud22c\uba85\ud558\uace0 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec \uc694\uc18c \uc911 \ud558\ub098\ub294 \uc124\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc778\ub370, \uc124\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c RL(XRL)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub9ce\uc740 \uc5f0\uad6c\uac00 \ub85c\uceec \ub2e8\uc77c \ub2e8\uacc4 \uacb0\uc815\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uada4\uc801 \uc218\uc900 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc7a5\uae30\uc801\uc778 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc911\uc694\uc131 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc744 \uc815\uc758\ud558\uace0 \uc9d1\uacc4\ud558\uc5ec \uc804\uccb4 \uada4\uc801\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc740 \uace0\uc804\uc801\uc778 Q-\uac12 \ucc28\uc774\uc5d0 '\uae09\uc9c4\uc801 \ud56d'\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc5d0 \ub3c4\ub2ec\ud558\ub824\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uace0, \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \ubbf8\uc138\ud558\uac8c \uce21\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uacbd\ud5d8 \ubaa8\uc74c\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uada4\uc801\uc744 \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \ub354 \ub098\uc544\uac00, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uada4\uc801 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ubc18\uc0ac\uc2e4\uc801 \ub864\uc544\uc6c3\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc120\ud0dd\ud55c \uacbd\ub85c\uac00 \ub300\uc548\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uac15\ub825\ud558\uac8c \uc6b0\uc218\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec \uc8fc\uc5b4 '\uc65c \uc774\uac83\uc744, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uadf8\uac83\uc774 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c?'\ub77c\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.

In offline RL, data providers share pre-collected datasets -- either as individual transitions or sequences of transitions forming trajectories -- to enable the training of RL models (also called agents) without direct interaction with the environments. Offline RL saves interactions with environments compared to traditional RL, and has been effective in critical areas, such as navigation tasks. Meanwhile, concerns about privacy leakage from offline RL datasets have emerged.\n  To safeguard private information in offline RL datasets, we propose the first differential privacy (DP) offline dataset synthesis method, PrivORL, which leverages a diffusion model and diffusion transformer to synthesize transitions and trajectories, respectively, under DP. The synthetic dataset can then be securely released for downstream analysis and research. PrivORL adopts the popular approach of pre-training a synthesizer on public datasets, and then fine-tuning on sensitive datasets using DP Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD). Additionally, PrivORL introduces curiosity-driven pre-training, which uses feedback from the curiosity module to diversify the synthetic dataset and thus can generate diverse synthetic transitions and trajectories that closely resemble the sensitive dataset. Extensive experiments on five sensitive offline RL datasets show that our method achieves better utility and fidelity in both DP transition and trajectory synthesis compared to baselines.

They lack runtime introspection, cannot diagnose their own failure modes, and do not improve over time without human intervention. In practice, many agent stacks degrade into decorated chains of LLM calls with no structural mechanisms for reliability. We present VIGIL (Verifiable Inspection and Guarded Iterative Learning), a reflective runtime that supervises a sibling agent and performs autonomous maintenance rather than task execution. VIGIL ingests behavioral logs, appraises each event into a structured emotional representation, maintains a persistent EmoBank with decay and contextual policies, and derives an RBT diagnosis that sorts recent behavior into strengths, opportunities, and failures. From this analysis, VIGIL generates both guarded prompt updates that preserve core identity semantics and read only code proposals produced by a strategy engine that operates on log evidence and code hotspots. VIGIL functions as a state gated pipeline. Illegal transitions produce explicit errors rather than allowing the LLM to improvise. In a reminder latency case study, VIGIL identified elevated lag, proposed prompt and code repairs, and when its own diagnostic tool failed due to a schema conflict, it surfaced the internal error, produced a fallback diagnosis, and emitted a repair plan. This demonstrates meta level self repair in a deployed agent runtime.", "AI": {"tldr": "VIGIL\uc740 \ub3c5\uc790\uc801\uc778 \uc720\uc9c0\ubcf4\uc218\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud558\uba70, LLM \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc790\uae30 \ubc18\uc601\uc801 \ub7f0\ud0c0\uc784\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 Agentic LLM \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uba70, \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc2e4\ud328 \uc9c4\ub2e8 \ubc0f \uac1c\uc120 \uae30\ub2a5\uc774 \uacb0\uc5ec\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "VIGIL\uc740 \ud589\ub3d9 \ub85c\uadf8\ub97c \uc218\uc9d1\ud558\uc5ec \uac10\uc815\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ud45c\ud604\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0, EmoBank\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba70, \ucd5c\uadfc \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uac15\uc810, \uae30\ud68c, \uc2e4\ud328\ub85c \ubd84\ub958\ud558\ub294 RBT \uc9c4\ub2e8\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "VIGIL\uc740 \ud575\uc2ec \uc815\uccb4\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc874\ud558\ub294 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\uc640 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc218\uc815\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uc0c1\ud0dc \uae30\ubc18 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc73c\ub85c \uae30\ub2a5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "VIGIL\uc740 \ubc30\ud3ec\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ub7f0\ud0c0\uc784\uc5d0\uc11c \uba54\ud0c0 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc790\uae30 \uc218\ub9ac\ub97c \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "Agentic LLM \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5 \ubd84\ud574, \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9 \ubc0f \ubc18\ubcf5 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc790\uc728\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc57d\uc18d\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \ubc30\ud3ec\ub41c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\ub2e4. \uc774\ub4e4\uc740 \uc2e4\ud589 \uc2dc\uac04 \ub0b4 \uc790\uae30 \ubc18\uc131\uc744 \uacb0\uc5ec\ud558\uace0, \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \uc2e4\ud328 \ubaa8\ub4dc\ub97c \uc9c4\ub2e8\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\uc73c\uba70 \uc778\uac04 \uac1c\uc785 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc2dc\uac04\uc774 \uc9c0\ub0a8\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uac1c\uc120\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294\ub2e4. \uc2e4\uc81c\ub85c \ub9ce\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2a4\ud0dd\uc740 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc7a5\uc2dd\ub41c LLM \ud638\ucd9c\uc758 \uc0ac\uc2ac\ub85c \uc804\ub77d\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 VIGIL(\uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uac80\uc0ac \ubc0f \ubcf4\ud638\ub41c \ubc18\ubcf5 \ud559\uc2b5)\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ud615\uc81c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uac10\ub3c5\ud558\uace0 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc2e4\ud589 \ub300\uc2e0 \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc720\uc9c0\ubcf4\uc218\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ubc18\uc0ac\uc801\uc778 \ub7f0\ud0c0\uc784\uc774\ub2e4.

We formalize this challenge as a problem of composite neural architecture search (NAS), where multiple source-specific modules and a fusion module are jointly optimized. Existing NAS methods overlook useful side information from the intermediate outputs of these modules -- such as their representation quality -- limiting sample efficiency in multi-source RL settings. To address this, we propose an LLM-driven NAS pipeline that leverages language-model priors and intermediate-output signals to guide sample-efficient search for high-performing composite state encoders.

Our key insight is that LLMs can reason about program states and analyze the potential vulnerabilities, rather than simple pattern matching. This can improve the model's generalizability and prevent learning shortcuts. However, SOTA reasoning LLMs are typically ultra-large, closed-source, or have limited performance in vulnerability detection. To address this, we propose a novel training recipe with specialized data selection, reasoning data generation, reasoning data filtering and correction, and testing-phase optimization. Using our proposed methodology, we train a reasoning model with seven billion parameters. Through extensive experiments on SOTA datasets across Python, C/C++, and Java, we show that VulnLLM-R has superior effectiveness and efficiency than SOTA static analysis tools and both open-source and commercial large reasoning models. We further conduct a detailed ablation study to validate the key designs in our training recipe. Finally, we construct an agent scaffold around our model and show that it outperforms CodeQL and AFL++ in real-world projects. Our agent further discovers a set of zero-day vulnerabilities in actively maintained repositories. This work represents a pioneering effort to enable real-world, project-level vulnerability detection using AI agents powered by specialized reasoning models.

We prove the taxonomy's visual coherence by training a CNN on raw grid pixels (95.24% accuracy on S3, 36.25% overall, 3.3x chance), then apply the taxonomy diagnostically to the original ARC-AGI-2 test set. Our curriculum analysis reveals 35.3% of tasks exhibit low neural affinity for Transformers--a distributional bias mirroring ARC-AGI-2. To probe this misalignment, we fine-tuned a 1.7M-parameter Transformer across 302 tasks, revealing a profound Compositional Gap: 210 of 302 tasks (69.5%) achieve >80% cell accuracy (local patterns) but <10% grid accuracy (global synthesis). This provides direct evidence for a Neural Affinity Ceiling Effect, where performance is bounded by architectural suitability, not curriculum. Applying our framework to Li et al.'s independent ViTARC study (400 specialists, 1M examples each) confirms its predictive power: Very Low affinity tasks achieve 51.9% versus 77.7% for High affinity (p<0.001), with a task at 0% despite massive data. The taxonomy enables precise diagnosis: low-affinity tasks (A2) hit hard ceilings, while high-affinity tasks (C1) reach 99.8%.

Efficiently solving this problem has implications ranging from pharmaceuticals to organic semiconductors, as crystal packing directly governs the physical and chemical properties of organic solids. In this paper, we introduce OXtal, a large-scale 100M parameter all-atom diffusion model that directly learns the conditional joint distribution over intramolecular conformations and periodic packing. To efficiently scale OXtal, we abandon explicit equivariant architectures imposing inductive bias arising from crystal symmetries in favor of data augmentation strategies. We further propose a novel crystallization-inspired lattice-free training scheme, Stoichiometric Stochastic Shell Sampling ($S^4$), that efficiently captures long-range interactions while sidestepping explicit lattice parametrization -- thus enabling more scalable architectural choices at all-atom resolution. By leveraging a large dataset of 600K experimentally validated crystal structures (including rigid and flexible molecules, co-crystals, and solvates), OXtal achieves orders-of-magnitude improvements over prior ab initio machine learning CSP methods, while remaining orders of magnitude cheaper than traditional quantum-chemical approaches. Specifically, OXtal recovers experimental structures with conformer $\\text{RMSD}_1<0.5$ \u00c5 and attains over 80\\% packing similarity rate, demonstrating its ability to model both thermodynamic and kinetic regularities of molecular crystallization.", "AI": {"tldr": "OXtal\uc740 3D \ubd84\uc790 \uacb0\uc815 \uad6c\uc870 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c, \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc790\ub8cc \uc99d\uac15 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\uc99d\ub41c \uacb0\uc815 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \uc608\uce21\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubd84\uc790 \uacb0\uc815 \uad6c\uc870 \uc608\uce21(CSP)\uc740 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \ubc0f \ud654\ud559\uc801 \uc131\uc9c8\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc778 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uacb0\uc815 \ud3ec\uc7a5 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc624\ub79c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "OXtal\uc740 100M \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130\uc758 \uc804\uc790 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c, \uacb0\uc815 \ub300\uce6d\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uadc0\ucc29 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \ud53c\ud558\uace0 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc99d\uac15 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ucc44\ud0dd\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacb0\uc815\ud654\uc5d0 \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc740 \uaca9\uc790 \uc5c6\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc778 $S^4$\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc7a5\uac70\ub9ac \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucea1\ucc98\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "OXtal\uc740 600K \uac1c\uc758 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\uc99d\ub41c \uacb0\uc815 \uad6c\uc870\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\uc874 ab initio \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 CSP \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc218\uc2ed \ubc30 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub41c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "OXtal\uc740 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c $\text{RMSD}_1<0.5$ \u00c5\uc758 \uc624\ucc28\ub85c \ubcf5\uc6d0\ud558\uace0 80\text{% \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \ud3ec\uc7a5 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \ubd84\uc790 \uacb0\uc815\ud654\uc758 \uc5f4\uc5ed\ud559\uc801 \ubc0f \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc801 \uaddc\uce59\uc131\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uacbd\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2e4\ud604 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c 3D \ubd84\uc790 \uacb0\uc815 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c 2D \ud654\ud559 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uacb0\uc815 \uad6c\uc870 \uc608\uce21(CSP)\uc774\ub77c\uace0 \ubd88\ub9ac\ub294 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ud654\ud559\uc758 \uc624\ub79c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc81c\uc57d \uc0b0\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\uae30 \ubc18\ub3c4\uccb4\uc5d0 \uc774\ub974\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud558\uba70, \uacb0\uc815 \ud3ec\uc7a5\uc740 \uc720\uae30 \uace0\uccb4\uc758 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \ubc0f \ud654\ud559\uc801 \uc131\uc9c8\uc744 \uc9c1\uc811 \uc9c0\ubc30\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 OXtal\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 100M \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \uc804\uc790 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ubd84\uc790 \ub0b4 \uad6c\uc131 \ud615\ud0dc \ubc0f \uc8fc\uae30\uc801 \ud3ec\uc7a5\uc758 \uc870\uac74\ubd80 \uacb0\ud569 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \uc9c1\uc811 \ud559\uc2b5\ud55c\ub2e4.

Browser agents are software that automate Web browsing using large language models and ancillary tooling. However, the automated capabilities that make browser agents powerful also make them high-risk points of failure. Both the kinds of tasks browser agents are designed to execute, along with the kinds of information browser agents are entrusted with to fulfill those tasks, mean that vulnerabilities in these tools can result in enormous privacy harm.\n  This work presents a framework of five broad factors (totaling 15 distinct measurements) to measure the privacy risks in browser agents. Our framework assesses i. vulnerabilities in the browser agent's components, ii. how the browser agent protects against website behaviors, iii. whether the browser agent prevents cross-site tracking, iv. how the agent responds to privacy-affecting prompts, and v. whether the tool leaks personal information to sites. We apply our framework to eight browser agents and identify 30 vulnerabilities, ranging from disabled browser privacy features to \"autocompleting\" sensitive personal information in form fields. We have responsibly disclosed our findings, and plan to release our dataset and other artifacts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ucd5c\uadfc \uc778\uae30 \uc788\ub294 \uc5ec\ub35f

However, most studies focus on general information retrieval and rarely explores vertical domains with unique challenges. In this work, we focus on local life services and introduce LocalSearchBench, which encompass diverse and complex business scenarios. Real-world queries in this domain are often ambiguous and require multi-hop reasoning across merchants and products, remaining challenging and not fully addressed. As the first comprehensive benchmark for agentic search in local life services, LocalSearchBench includes over 150,000 high-quality entries from various cities and business types. We construct 300 multi-hop QA tasks based on real user queries, challenging agents to understand questions and retrieve information in multiple steps. We also developed LocalPlayground, a unified environment integrating multiple tools for agent interaction. Experiments show that even state-of-the-art LRMs struggle on LocalSearchBench: the best model (DeepSeek-V3.1) achieves only 34.34% correctness, and most models have issues with completeness (average 77.33%) and faithfulness (average 61.99%).

Tauhidul Islam"], "title": "Transformation of Biological Networks into Images via Semantic Cartography for Visual Interpretation and Scalable Deep Analysis", "comment": null, "summary": "Complex biological networks are fundamental to biomedical science, capturing interactions among molecules, cells, genes, and tissues. Deciphering these networks is critical for understanding health and disease, yet their scale and complexity represent a daunting challenge for current computational methods. Traditional biological network analysis methods, including deep learning approaches, while powerful, face inherent challenges such as limited scalability, oversmoothing long-range dependencies, difficulty in multimodal integration, expressivity bounds, and poor interpretability. We present Graph2Image, a framework that transforms large biological networks into sets of two-dimensional images by spatially arranging representative network nodes on a 2D grid. This transformation decouples the nodes as images, enabling the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with global receptive fields and multi-scale pyramids, thus overcoming limitations of existing biological network analysis methods in scalability, memory efficiency, and long-range context capture. Graph2Image also facilitates seamless integration with other imaging and omics modalities and enhances interpretability through direct visualization of node-associated images. When applied to several large-scale biological network datasets, Graph2Image improved classification accuracy by up to 67.2% over existing methods and provided interpretable visualizations that revealed biologically coherent patterns. It also allows analysis of very large biological networks (nodes > 1 billion) on a personal computer. Graph2Image thus provides a scalable, interpretable, and multimodal-ready approach for biological network analysis, offering new opportunities for disease diagnosis and the study of complex biological systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Graph2Image\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c 2D \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uc9d1\ud569\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uace0, \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uae30\ud68c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud574\ub3c5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uac74\uac15\uacfc \uc9c8\ubcd1 \uc774\ud574\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c\ub370, \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \uaddc\ubaa8\uc640 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ub3c4\uc804\ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "Graph2Image\ub294 \ub300\ud45c\uc801\uc778 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ub178\ub4dc\ub97c 2D \uaca9\uc790\uc5d0 \uacf5\uac04\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubc30\uce58\ud558\uc5ec \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c 2\ucc28\uc6d0 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 CNN\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1, \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \ubc0f \uc7a5\uae30 \ub9e5\ub77d \ud3ec\ucc29\uc758 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "Graph2Image\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud588\uc744 \ub54c \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95 \ub300\ube44 \ubd84\ub958 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ucd5c\ub300 67.2% \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf30\uace0, \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc2dc\uac01\ud654\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc5ec \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Graph2Image\ub294 \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uc9c8\ubcd1 \uc9c4\ub2e8 \ubc0f \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uae30\ud68c\ub97c \uc5f4\uc5b4\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc0dd\ubb3c \uc758\ud559 \uacfc\ud559\uc758 \uae30\ubcf8\uc73c\ub85c, \ubd84\uc790, \uc138\ud3ec, \uc720\uc804\uc790 \ubc0f \uc870\uc9c1 \uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud574\ub3c5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uac74\uac15\uacfc \uc9c8\ubcd1\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uadf8 \uaddc\ubaa8\uc640 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc774 \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ud070 \ub3c4\uc804\uc774 \ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ubd84\uc11d \ubc29\ubc95, \ud2b9\ud788 \ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uac15\ub825\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ud55c\uacc4\uac00 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ud655\uc7a5\uc131, \uc7a5\uac70\ub9ac \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc758 \uacfc\ub3c4\ud55c \ud3c9\ud0c4\ud654, \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ud1b5\ud569\uc758 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0, \ud45c\ud604\uc131 \ud55c\uacc4 \ubc0f \ub0ae\uc740 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \ub4f1\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Graph2Image\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c 2D \uaca9\uc790\uc5d0 \ub300\ud45c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ub178\ub4dc\ub97c \uacf5\uac04\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubc30\uc5f4\ud558\uc5ec 2\ucc28\uc6d0 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uc9d1\ud569\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubcc0\ud658\uc740 \ub178\ub4dc\ub97c \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub85c \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\uc5ec \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uc218\uc6a9 \ud544\ub4dc \ubc0f \ub2e4\uc911 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c \ud53c\ub77c\ubbf8\ub4dc\ub97c \uac16\ucd98 \ucee8\ubcfc\ub8e8\uc158 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(CNN)\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ubd84\uc11d \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ud655\uc7a5\uc131, \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \ubc0f \uc7a5\uae30 \ub9e5\ub77d \ud3ec\ucc29\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

In this work, ADLAH is introduced: an Adaptive Deep Learning Anomaly Detection Honeynet designed to maximize high-fidelity threat intelligence while minimizing cost through autonomous orchestration of infrastructure. The principal contribution is offered as an end-to-end architectural blueprint and vision for an AI-driven deception platform. Feasibility is evidenced by a functional prototype of the central decision mechanism, in which a reinforcement learning (RL) agent determines, in real time, when sessions should be escalated from low-interaction sensor nodes to dynamically provisioned, high-interaction honeypots. Because sufficient live data were unavailable, field-scale validation is not claimed; instead, design trade-offs and limitations are detailed, and a rigorous roadmap toward empirical evaluation at scale is provided. Beyond selective escalation and anomaly detection, the architecture pursues automated extraction, clustering, and versioning of bot attack chains, a core capability motivated by the empirical observation that exposed services are dominated by automated traffic. Together, these elements delineate a practical path toward cost-efficient capture of high-value adversary behavior, systematic bot versioning, and the production of actionable threat intelligence.",

A Qualitative Analysis of Success and Failure Scenarios of Various LLMs in Agentic Simulations", "comment": "48 pages, 3 tables, 2 listings", "summary": "We investigate how large language models (LLMs) fail when operating as autonomous agents with tool-use capabilities. Using the Kamiwaza Agentic Merit Index (KAMI) v0.1 benchmark, we analyze 900 execution traces from three representative models - Granite 4 Small, Llama 4 Maverick, and DeepSeek V3.1 - across filesystem, text extraction, CSV analysis, and SQL scenarios. Rather than focusing on aggregate scores, we perform fine-grained, per-trial behavioral analysis to surface the strategies that enable successful multi-step tool execution and the recurrent failure modes that undermine reliability. Our findings show that model scale alone does not predict agentic robustness: Llama 4 Maverick (400B) performs only marginally better than Granite 4 Small (32B) in some uncertainty-driven tasks, while DeepSeek V3.1's superior reliability derives primarily from post-training reinforcement learning rather than architecture or size. Across models, we identify four recurring failure archetypes: premature action without grounding, over-helpfulness that substitutes missing entities, vulnerability to distractor-induced context pollution, and fragile execution under load. These patterns highlight the need for agentic evaluation methods that emphasize interactive grounding, recovery behavior, and environment-aware adaptation, suggesting that reliable enterprise deployment requires not just stronger models but deliberate training and design choices that reinforce verification, constraint discovery, and adherence to source-of-truth data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac16\ucd98 \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \uc791\ub3d9\ud560 \ub54c \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc774 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc2e4\ud328\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac16\ucd98 \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c\uc11c LLM\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc2e4\ud328 \uc6d0\uc778\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud568\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "Kamiwaza Agentic Merit Index (KAMI) v0.1 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec Granite 4 Small, Llama 4 Maverick, DeepSeek V3.1 \uc138 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 900\uac1c \uc2e4\ud589 \ucd94\uc801\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ubaa8\ub378 \ud06c\uae30\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uacac\uace0\ud568\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\uc73c\uba70, DeepSeek V3.1\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc740 \uc8fc\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828 \ud6c4 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc88c\uc6b0\ub41c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uc788\ub294 \uae30\uc5c5 \ubc30\ud3ec\ub97c \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \ub354 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uac80\uc99d, \uc81c\uc57d \ubc1c\uacac, \uc9c4\uc2e4\uc758 \ucd9c\ucc98 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc900\uc218\ub97c \uac15\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubc0f \uc124\uacc4 \uc120\ud0dd\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc774 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac16\ucd98 \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \uc791\ub3d9\ud560 \ub54c \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc2e4\ud328\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Existing methods, while leveraging surrogate model approximation and historical knowledge transfer, are often under restrictive assumptions such as fixed drift intervals and fully environmental observability, limiting their adaptability to diverse dynamic environments. We propose TRACE, a TRAnsferable C}oncept-drift Estimator that effectively detects distributional changes in streaming data with varying time scales. TRACE leverages a principled tokenization strategy to extract statistical features from data streams and models drift patterns using attention-based sequence learning, enabling accurate detection on unseen datasets and highlighting the transferability of learned drift patterns. Further, we showcase TRACE's plug-and-play nature by integrating it into a streaming optimizer, facilitating adaptive optimization under unknown drifts.

We introduce the Agent Capability Problem (ACP), a framework for predicting whether an agent can solve a problem under resource constraints. Rather than relying on empirical heuristics, ACP frames problem-solving as information acquisition: an agent requires $\\Itotal$ bits to identify a solution and gains $\\Istep$ bits per action at cost $\\Cstep$, yielding an effective cost $\\Ceff = (\\Itotal/\\Istep), \\Cstep$ that predicts resource requirements before search. We prove that $\\Ceff$ lower-bounds expected cost and provide tight probabilistic upper bounds. Experimental validation shows that ACP predictions closely track actual agent performance, consistently bounding search effort while improving efficiency over greedy and random strategies. The framework generalizes across LLM-based and agentic workflows, linking principles from active learning, Bayesian optimization, and reinforcement learning through a unified information-theoretic lens. \\", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc790\uc6d0\uc744 \uc5b8\uc81c \ud2b9\uc815 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ud560\ub2f9\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uba70, \uc790\uc6d0 \uc81c\uc57d \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 Agent Capability Problem (ACP)\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4 \ud68d\ub4dd\uc73c\ub85c \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0\uc744 \ud615\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uae30\ub300 \ube44\uc6a9\uc758 \ud558\ud55c\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud558\uba70, \uc2e4\uc81c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc815\ud655\ud788 \ucd94\uc801\ud558\uc5ec \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ub9ac\uc18c\uc2a4\ub97c \ud560\ub2f9\ud558\ub294 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uc2dc\uc810\uc744 \ud30c\uc545\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "Agent Capability Problem (ACP)\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0\uc744 \uc815\ubcf4 \ud68d\ub4dd\uc73c\ub85c \uac04\uc8fc\ud558\uace0, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ube44\ud2b8 \uc218\uc640 \uac01 \ud589\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc5bb\ub294 \ube44\ud2b8 \uc218\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc ACP\uc758 \uc608\uce21\uc774 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc815\ud655\ud788 \ub530\ub77c\uac00\uba70, \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ub178\ub825\uc744 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uc81c\ud55c\ud558\uace0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ubc0f \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud750\ub984 \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub418\uba70, \ub2a5\ub3d9 \ud559\uc2b5, \ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubc0f \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc6d0\ub9ac\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ub41c \uc815\ubcf4 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5f0\uacb0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uc790\uc6d0\uc744 \ud560\ub2f9\ud574\uc57c \ud560 \uc2dc\uc810\uc740 \uc5b8\uc81c\uc77c\uae4c\uc694? \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc790\uc6d0 \uc81c\uc57d \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Agent Capability Problem (ACP)\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uae30\ubcf4\ub2e4\ub294, ACP\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0\uc744 \uc815\ubcf4 \ud68d\ub4dd\uc73c\ub85c \ud504\ub808\uc774\ubc0d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ud574\ub2f5\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 $\text{Itotal}$ \ube44\ud2b8\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uba70, \ud589\ub3d9\ub2f9 $\text{Istep}$ \ube44\ud2b8\ub97c \uc5bb\uace0 \ube44\uc6a9 $\text{Cstep}$\uc744 \uc9c0\ubd88\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \ucd1d \ube44\uc6a9 $\text{Ceff} = (\text{Itotal}/\text{Istep}), \text{Cstep}$\ub97c \uc608\uce21\ud558\uc5ec \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uc804\uc5d0 \uc790\uc6d0 \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 $\text{Ceff}$\uac00 \uae30\ub300 \ube44\uc6a9\uc758 \ud558\ud55c\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0 \ud0c0\uc774\ud2b8\ud55c \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uc0c1\ud55c\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud568\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801 \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 ACP\uc758 \uc608\uce21\uc774 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \ubc00\uc811\ud55c \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ub178\ub825\uc744 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uc81c\ud55c\ud558\uace0 \ud0d0\uc695\uc801 \ubc0f \uc784\uc758 \uc804\ub7b5\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ubc0f \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud750\ub984 \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub418\uba70, \ub2a5\ub3d9 \ud559\uc2b5, \ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubc0f \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc6d0\ub9ac\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ub41c \uc815\ubcf4 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5f0\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, state-of-the-art methods of drawing these tickets, like Lottery Ticket Rewinding (LTR), are computationally prohibitive, while more efficient saliency-based Pruning-at-Initialization (PaI) techniques suffer from a significant accuracy-sparsity trade-off and fail basic sanity checks. In this work, we argue that PaI's reliance on first-order saliency metrics, which ignore inter-weight dependencies, contributes substantially to this performance gap, especially in the sparse regime. To address this, we introduce Concrete Ticket Search (CTS), an algorithm that frames subnetwork discovery as a holistic combinatorial optimization problem. By leveraging a Concrete relaxation of the discrete search space and a novel gradient balancing scheme (GRADBALANCE) to control sparsity, CTS efficiently identifies high-performing subnetworks near initialization without requiring sensitive hyperparameter tuning. Motivated by recent works on lottery ticket training dynamics, we further propose a knowledge distillation-inspired family of pruning objectives, finding that minimizing the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence between sparse and dense network outputs (CTS-KL) is particularly effective. Experiments on varying image classification tasks show that CTS produces subnetworks that robustly pass sanity checks and achieve accuracy comparable to or exceeding LTR, while requiring only a small fraction of the computation. For example, on ResNet-20 on CIFAR10, it reaches 99.3% sparsity with 74.0% accuracy in 7.9 minutes, while LTR attains the same sparsity with 68.3% accuracy in 95.2 minutes. CTS's subnetworks outperform saliency-based methods across all sparsities, but its advantage over LTR is most pronounced in the highly sparse regime.", "AI": {"tldr": "Concrete Ticket Search

We first investigate the dynamic nature of token unmasking confidence across blocks and steps. Based on this observation, we present a lightweight adaptive approach that controls the generation block size, step size, and threshold based on the average confidence of unmasked tokens. We further reduce softmax overhead by dynamically leveraging a subset of the vocabulary to regulate sampling breadth. CadLLM is a plug-and-play, model-agnostic method compatible with KV-cache-based dLLMs. Extensive experiments on four popular tasks demonstrate that CadLLM yields up to 2.28x throughput improvement over the state-of-the-art baseline with competitive accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "CadLLM\uc740 \ud655\uc0b0 \uae30\ubc18 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828 \ud544\uc694 \uc5c6\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\ube14\ub85d\uacfc \ub2e8\uacc4\ubcc4\ub85c \ud1a0\ud070\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \uad00\ucc30\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131 \ube14\ub85d \ud06c\uae30, \ub2e8\uacc4 \ud06c\uae30 \ubc0f \uc784\uacc4\uac12\uc744 \uc870\uc808\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ub7c9 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "CadLLM\uc740 \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uae30\uc220 \uae30\uc900 \ub300\ube44 \ucd5c\ub300 2.28\ubc30\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "CadLLM\uc740 KV \uce90\uc2dc \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ud655\uc0b0 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ud638\ud658\ub418\ub294 \ud50c\ub7ec\uadf8 \uc564 \ud50c\ub808\uc774 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378 \ubd88\ubb38 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 CadLLM\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\ub294\ub370, \uc774\ub294 \ud655\uc0b0 \uae30\ubc18 LLM(\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378)\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ucc98\ub9ac\ub97c \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud6c8\ub828 \ud544\uc694 \uc5c6\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uba3c\uc800 \ube14\ub85d\uacfc \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \ud1a0\ud070\uc758 \ube44\uacf5\uc2dd\ud654 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub3c4\uc758 \ub3d9\uc801 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uad00\ucc30\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uc5ec, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ube44\uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ub41c \ud1a0\ud070\uc758 \ud3c9\uade0 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub3c4\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc0dd\uc131 \ube14\ub85d \ud06c\uae30, \ub2e8\uacc4 \ud06c\uae30 \ubc0f \uc784\uacc4\uac12\uc744 \uc870\uc808\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ub7c9 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub610\ud55c \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uc758 \ud3ed\uc744 \uc870\uc808\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc5b4\ud718\uc758 \ud558\uc704 \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec softmax \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c \uc904\uc778\ub2e4.

While diffusion models demonstrate exceptional performance in generation tasks, their application to TSF remains largely confined to modeling single-modality numerical sequences, overlooking the abundant cross-modal signals inherent in complex heterogeneous data. To address this gap, we propose UniDiff, a unified diffusion framework for multimodal time series forecasting. To process the numerical sequence, our framework first tokenizes the time series into patches, preserving local temporal dynamics by mapping each patch to an embedding space via a lightweight MLP. At its core lies a unified and parallel fusion module, where a single cross-attention mechanism adaptively weighs and integrates structural information from timestamps and semantic context from texts in one step, enabling a flexible and efficient interplay between modalities. Furthermore, we introduce a novel classifier-free guidance mechanism designed for multi-source conditioning, allowing for decoupled control over the guidance strength of textual and temporal information during inference, which significantly enhances model robustness. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmark datasets across eight domains demonstrate that the proposed UniDiff model achieves state-of-the-art performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "UniDiff\ub294

However, the data-based pattern makes related algorithms learn and even exacerbate potential bias in samples, resulting in discriminatory decisions against certain unprivileged groups, depriving them of the rights to equal treatment, thus damaging the social well-being and hindering the development of related applications. Therefore, we propose a pre-processing method IFFair based on the influence function. Compared with other fairness optimization approaches, IFFair only uses the influence disparity of training samples on different groups as a guidance to dynamically adjust the sample weights during training without modifying the network structure, data features and decision boundaries. To evaluate the validity of IFFair, we conduct experiments on multiple real-world datasets and metrics. The experimental results show that our approach mitigates bias of multiple accepted metrics in the classification setting, including demographic parity, equalized odds, equality of opportunity and error rate parity without conflicts. It also demonstrates that IFFair achieves better trade-off between multiple utility and fairness metrics compared with previous pre-processing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uba38\uc2e0\ub7ec\ub2dd\uc758 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0ac\uc804 \ucc98\ub9ac \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 IFFair\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uba38\uc2e0\ub7ec\ub2dd\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18 \ud328\ud134\uc774 \ud2b9\uc815 \ubd88\ud3c9\ub4f1 \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uace0 \uc545\ud654\uc2dc\ucf1c \ucc28\ubcc4\uc801\uc778 \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud558\ubbc0\ub85c \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \ubcf5\uc9c0\ub97c \ud574\uce58\uace0 \uad00\ub828 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \uc800\ud574\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "IFFair\ub294 \uad50\uc721 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc758 \uc601\ud5a5 \ubd88\uade0\ud615\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc0d8\ud50c \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub97c \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc0ac\uc804 \ucc98\ub9ac \ubc29\ubc95\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uad6c\uc870, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud2b9\uc131 \ubc0f \uacb0\uc815 \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \ubcc0\uacbd\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc9c4\ud589\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "IFFair\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uacfc \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2e4\ud5d8\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc218\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd84\ub958 \uc124\uc815\uc758 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "IFFair\ub294 \uc774\uc804\uc758 \uc0ac\uc804 \ucc98\ub9ac \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc720\ud2f8\ub9ac\ud2f0 \ubc0f \uacf5\uc815\uc131 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad \uac04\uc758 \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uba38\uc2e0\ub7ec\ub2dd\uc740 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \ud3b8\uc758\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b4\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ub300\uccb4\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc774 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18 \ud328\ud134\uc740 \uad00\ub828 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc774 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uace0 \uc2ec\ud654\uc2dc\ucf1c \ud2b9\uc815 \ubd88\ub9ac\ud55c \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucc28\ubcc4\uc801 \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud558\uace0 \ud3c9\ub4f1\ud55c \ub300\uc6b0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad8c\ub9ac\ub97c \ubc15\ud0c8\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \ubcf5\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ud574\ub97c \ub07c\uce58\uace0 \uad00\ub828 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \uc800\ud574\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5 \ud568\uc218\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uc0ac\uc804 \ucc98\ub9ac \ubc29\ubc95 IFFair\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

It is mainly because intent is clarified progressively and the environment evolves with each tool call. While reusing past experience is natural, current LLM agents either treat entire trajectories or pre-defined subtasks as indivisible units, or solely exploit tool-to-tool dependencies, hindering adaptation as states and information evolve across turns. In this paper, we propose a State Integrated Tool Graph (SIT-Graph), which enhances multi-turn tool use by exploiting partially overlapping experience. Inspired by human decision-making that integrates episodic and procedural memory, SIT-Graph captures both compact state representations (episodic-like fragments) and tool-to-tool dependencies (procedural-like routines) from historical trajectories. Specifically, we first build a tool graph from accumulated tool-use sequences, and then augment each edge with a compact state summary of the dialog and tool history that may shape the next action. At inference time, SIT-Graph enables a human-like balance between episodic recall and procedural execution: when the next decision requires recalling prior context, the agent retrieves the state summaries stored on relevant edges and uses them to guide its next action; when the step is routine, it follows high-confidence tool dependencies without explicit recall. Experiments across multiple stateful multi-turn tool-use benchmarks show that SIT-Graph consistently outperforms strong memory- and graph-based baselines, delivering more robust tool selection and more effective experience transfer.", "AI": {"tldr": "SIT-Graph\uc740 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubd80\ubd84\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uacb9\uce58\ub294 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub3c4\uad6c \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uc2dc\uc758 \ucc4c\ub9b0\uc9c0\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc9c4\uc804\uc5d0 \uae30\ucd08\ud558\uc5ec \uacbd\ud5d8 \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9\uc774 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "SIT-Graph\ub294 \uacfc\uac70\uc758 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uacbd\ub85c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc694\uc57d\uacfc \ub3c4\uad6c \uac04 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ub3c4\uad6c \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uace0, \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "SIT-Graph\ub294 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ubc0f \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\uc5ec \ub354 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c \uc120\ud0dd\uacfc \uacbd\ud5d8 \uc804\uc774\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "SIT-Graph\ub294 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ube44\ub85d \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \uc9c4\uc804\uc774 \uc788\uc5c8\uc74c\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \ub2e4\ud68c\uc804 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub294 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc758\ub3c4\uac00 \uc810\uc9c4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uba85\ud655\ud574\uc9c0\uace0 \ud658\uacbd\uc774 \uac01 \ub3c4\uad6c \ud638\ucd9c\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc9c4\ud654\ud558\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacfc\uac70 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc744 \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7ec\uc6b4 \ubc18\uba74, \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc804\uccb4 \uacbd\ub85c\ub098 \ubbf8\ub9ac \uc815\uc758\ub41c \ud558\uc704 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uac1c\ubcc4 \ub2e8\uc704\ub85c \ucde8\uae09\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ub3c4\uad6c \uac04 \uc758\uc874\uc131\ub9cc\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc640 \uc815\ubcf4\uac00 \ud68c\uc804\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc9c4\ud654\ud560 \ub54c \uc801\uc751\uc744 \uc800\ud574\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubd80\ubd84\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uacb9\uce58\ub294 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\ud68c\uc804 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \uc0c1\ud0dc \ud1b5\ud569 \ub3c4\uad6c \uadf8\ub798\ud504(SIT-Graph)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5d0\ud53c\uc18c\ub515 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\uc640 \uc808\ucc28\uc801 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc601\uac10\uc744 \uc5bb\uc5b4, SIT-Graph\ub294 \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801\uc778 \uacbd\ub85c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc555\ucd95\ub41c \uc0c1\ud0dc \ud45c\ud604(\uc5d0\ud53c\uc18c\ub515\uacfc \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uc870\uac01)\uacfc \ub3c4\uad6c \uac04 \uc758\uc874\uc131(\uc808\ucc28\uc801\uacfc \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \ub8e8\ud2f4)\uc744 \ubaa8\ub450 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788, \uba3c\uc800 \ub204\uc801\ub41c \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ub3c4\uad6c \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ud6c4 \uac01 \uc5e3\uc9c0\ub97c \ub300\ud654 \ubc0f \ub3c4\uad6c \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc555\ucd95 \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc694\uc57d\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\uac15\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc74c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud615\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 SIT-Graph\ub294 \uc5d0\ud53c\uc18c\ub515 \ud68c\uc0c1\uacfc \uc808\ucc28\uc801 \uc2e4\ud589 \uac04\uc758 \uc778\uac04\uacfc \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: \ub2e4\uc74c \uacb0\uc815\uc774 \uc774\uc804 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc744 \ud68c\uc0c1\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\uc744 \uacbd\uc6b0, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uad00\ub828 \uc5e3\uc9c0\uc5d0 \uc800\uc7a5\ub41c \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc694\uc57d\uc744 \uac80\uc0c9\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc74c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc548\ub0b4\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4;

Traditional model unlearning approaches require computationally expensive fine-tuning or direct weight editing, making them impractical for real-world deployment. In this work, we introduce LoRA-based Unlearning with Negative Examples (LUNE), a lightweight framework that performs negative-only unlearning by updating only low-rank adapters while freezing the backbone, thereby localizing edits and avoiding disruptive global changes. Leveraging Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), LUNE targets intermediate representations to suppress (or replace) requested knowledge with an order-of-magnitude lower compute and memory than full fine-tuning or direct weight editing.

Conventional traffic management strategies, including route guidance, ramp metering, and traffic signal control, often rely on state feedback controllers, used for their simplicity and reactivity; however, they lack the adaptability required to cope with complex and time-varying traffic dynamics. This paper proposes a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework in which each agent adaptively tunes the parameters of a state feedback traffic controller, combining the reactivity of state feedback controllers with the adaptability of reinforcement learning. By tuning parameters at a lower frequency rather than directly determining control actions at a high frequency, the reinforcement learning agents achieve improved training efficiency while maintaining adaptability to varying traffic conditions. The multi-agent structure further enhances system robustness, as local controllers can operate independently in the event of partial failures. The proposed framework is evaluated on a simulated multi-class transportation network under varying traffic conditions. Results show that the proposed multi-agent framework outperforms the no control and fixed-parameter state feedback control cases, while performing on par with the single-agent RL-based adaptive state feedback control, with a much better resilience to partial failures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uad50\ud1b5 \uc2e0\ud638 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uad50\ud1b5 \uad00\ub9ac \uc804\ub7b5\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud558\uace0 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ub3d9\ud558\ub294 \uad50\ud1b5 \uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc801\uc751\uc131\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\uac01 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc0c1\ud0dc \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \uad50\ud1b5 \uc81c\uc5b4\uae30\uc758 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ub41c \ub2e4\uc911 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4 \uad50\ud1b5 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uad50\ud1b5 \uc870\uac74 \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc801\uc751\uc131\uacfc \ubd80\ubd84 \uc2e4\ud328\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc800\ud56d\ub825\uc774 \ub354 \uc6b0\uc218\ud558\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uad50\ud1b5 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub294 \uad50\ud1b5 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \ud63c\uc7a1\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uad50\ud1b5 \uad00\ub9ac \uc804\ub7b5\uc740 \uacbd\ub85c \uc548\ub0b4, \ub7a8\ud504 \ubbf8\ud130\ub9c1 \ubc0f \uad50\ud1b5 \uc2e0\ud638 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub4e4\uc740 \ub2e8\uc21c\uc131\uacfc \ubc18\uc751\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc0c1\ud0dc \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \uc81c\uc5b4\uae30\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub4e4\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud558\uace0 \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ubcc0\ud558\ub294 \uad50\ud1b5 \uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc801\uc751\uc131\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uac01 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc0c1\ud0dc \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \uad50\ud1b5 \uc81c\uc5b4\uae30\uc758 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc0c1\ud0dc \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \uc81c\uc5b4\uae30\uc758 \ubc18\uc751\uc131\uacfc \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc801\uc751\uc131\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \ub0ae\uc740 \ube48\ub3c4\ub85c \uc870\uc815\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368, \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ub192\uc740 \ube48\ub3c4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc778 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ub3d9\uc791\uc744 \uacb0\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ub300\uc2e0 \ud6c8\ub828 \ud6a8\uc728\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uace0 \ubcc0\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uad50\ud1b5 \uc870\uac74\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc801\uc751\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uad6c\uc870\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uac15\uc778\uc131\uc744 \ub354\uc6b1 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba70, \uc9c0\uc5ed \uc81c\uc5b4\uae30\ub294 \ubd80\ubd84\uc801\uc778 \uc2e4\ud328\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud560 \uacbd\uc6b0 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\ub3d9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ubcc0\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uad50\ud1b5 \uc870\uac74 \ud558\uc5d0 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ub41c \ub2e4\uc911 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4 \uad50\ud1b5 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 \uc81c\uc5b4\uac00 \uc5c6\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uc640 \uace0\uc815 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \uc0c1\ud0dc \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \uc81c\uc5b4\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc18 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc0c1\ud0dc \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \uc81c\uc5b4\uc640 \ub3d9\ub4f1\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ubd80\ubd84 \uc2e4\ud328\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc800\ud56d\ub825\uc774 \ud6e8\uc52c \uc6b0\uc218\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Our analysis centers on Comet, an AI-powered browser developed by Perplexity, and its integrated agent, Comet Assistant. Drawing on hundreds of millions of anonymized user interactions, we address three fundamental questions: Who is using AI agents? How intensively are they using them? And what are they using them for? Our findings reveal substantial heterogeneity in adoption and usage across user segments. Earlier adopters, users in countries with higher GDP per capita and educational attainment, and individuals working in digital or knowledge-intensive sectors -- such as digital technology, academia, finance, marketing, and entrepreneurship -- are more likely to adopt or actively use the agent. To systematically characterize the substance of agent usage, we introduce a hierarchical agentic taxonomy that organizes use cases across three levels: topic, subtopic, and task. The two largest topics, Productivity & Workflow and Learning & Research, account for 57% of all agentic queries, while the two largest subtopics, Courses and Shopping for Goods, make up 22%. The top 10 out of 90 tasks represent 55% of queries. Personal use constitutes 55% of queries, while professional and educational contexts comprise 30% and 16%, respectively. In the short term, use cases exhibit strong stickiness, but over time users tend to shift toward more cognitively oriented topics.
