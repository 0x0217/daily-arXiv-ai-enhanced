However, current trading agents primarily focus on single-step trading\ntasks and lack awareness of continuous position management. Therefore, we\npropose a position-aware trading task designed to simulate a more realistic\nmarket. To address this task, we develop a trading agent system, FinPos,\noptimized for position management. FinPos is able to interpret various types of\nmarket information from a professional perspective, providing a reliable basis\nfor positioning decisions. To mitigate the substantial market risks arising\nfrom position fluctuations, FinPos employs dual decision agents. Furthermore,\nthe continuous nature of position management necessitates our adoption of\nmulti-timescale rewards, which in turn empowers FinPos to effectively balance\nshort-term fluctuations against long-term trends. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that FinPos surpasses state-of-the-art trading agents in the\nposition-aware trading task, which closely mirrors real market conditions. More\nimportantly, our findings reveal that LLM-centered agent systems exhibit a\nvast, largely unexplored potential in long-term market decision-making."}

Openness in MARL refers\nto the dynam-ic nature of agent populations, tasks, and agent types with-in a\nsystem. Specifically, there are three types of openness as reported in (Eck et\nal. 2023) [2]: agent openness, where agents can enter or leave the system at\nany time; task openness, where new tasks emerge, and existing ones evolve or\ndisappear; and type openness, where the capabil-ities and behaviors of agents\nchange over time. This report provides a conceptual and empirical review,\nfocusing on the interplay between openness and the credit assignment problem\n(CAP). CAP involves determining the contribution of individual agents to the\noverall system performance, a task that becomes increasingly complex in open\nenviron-ments. Traditional credit assignment (CA) methods often assume static\nagent populations, fixed and pre-defined tasks, and stationary types, making\nthem inadequate for open systems. We first conduct a conceptual analysis,\nin-troducing new sub-categories of openness to detail how events like agent\nturnover or task cancellation break the assumptions of environmental\nstationarity and fixed team composition that underpin existing CAP methods. We\nthen present an empirical study using representative temporal and structural\nalgorithms in an open environment.

We\nreport the evaluations performed on these papers by domain experts, who\nprovided both numerical scores and review-like feedback. We then highlight the\nstrengths, weaknesses, and limitations of the current system. Finally, we\ndiscuss the ethical implications of AI-driven research and reflect on how such\ntechnology relates to the philosophy of science. We publicly release the code\nat https://github.com/AstroPilot-AI/Denario. A Denario demo can also be run\ndirectly on the web at https://huggingface.co/spaces/astropilot-ai/Denario, and\nthe full app will be deployed on the cloud."}

Existing defense strategies preemptively build\nrobustness via attack simulation but suffer from fundamental limitations: (i)\nthe infeasibility of extending attack simulations beyond bounded threat models\ndue to the inherent difficulty of anticipating unknown attacks, and (ii)\nlimited adaptability to varying attack settings, as simulation fails to capture\ntheir variability and complexity. To address these challenges, we propose\nBayesian Data Scheduler (BDS), an adaptive tuning-stage defense strategy with\nno need for attack simulation. BDS formulates harmful fine-tuning defense as a\nBayesian inference problem, learning the posterior distribution of each data\npoint's safety attribute, conditioned on the fine-tuning and alignment\ndatasets. The fine-tuning process is then constrained by weighting data with\ntheir safety attributes sampled from the posterior, thus mitigating the\ninfluence of harmful data. By leveraging the post hoc nature of Bayesian\ninference, the posterior is conditioned on the fine-tuning dataset, enabling\nBDS to tailor its defense to the specific dataset, thereby achieving adaptive\ndefense.

Bogdan contributed equally to this work, and\n  their listed order was determined by coinflip", "summary": "Most work interpreting reasoning models studies only a single\nchain-of-thought (CoT), yet these models define distributions over many\npossible CoTs. We argue that studying a single sample is inadequate for\nunderstanding causal influence and the underlying computation. Though fully\nspecifying this distribution is intractable, it can be understood by sampling.\nWe present case studies using resampling to investigate model decisions. First,\nwhen a model states a reason for its action, does that reason actually cause\nthe action? In \"agentic misalignment\" scenarios, we resample specific sentences\nto measure their downstream effects. Self-preservation sentences have small\ncausal impact, suggesting they do not meaningfully drive blackmail. Second, are\nartificial edits to CoT sufficient for steering reasoning? These are common in\nliterature, yet take the model off-policy. Resampling and selecting a\ncompletion with the desired property is a principled on-policy alternative. We\nfind off-policy interventions yield small and unstable effects compared to\nresampling in decision-making tasks. Third, how do we understand the effect of\nremoving a reasoning step when the model may repeat it post-edit? We introduce\na resilience metric that repeatedly resamples to prevent similar content from\nreappearing downstream. Critical planning statements resist removal but have\nlarge effects when eliminated. Fourth, since CoT is sometimes \"unfaithful\", can\nour methods teach us anything in these settings? Adapting causal mediation\nanalysis, we find that hints that have a causal effect on the output without\nbeing explicitly mentioned exert a subtle and cumulative influence on the CoT\nthat persists even if the hint is removed. Overall, studying distributions via\nresampling enables reliable causal analysis, clearer narratives of model\nreasoning, and principled CoT interventions."}

The core\nmechanism of Nous is a training framework grounded in the first principles of\ninformation theory. Within this framework, we define the information gain from\ndialogue as an intrinsic reward signal, which is fundamentally equivalent to\nthe reduction of Shannon entropy over a structured task space. This reward\ndesign enables us to avoid reliance on costly human preference annotations or\nexternal reward models. To validate our framework, we develop an automated\nsimulation pipeline to generate a large-scale, preference-based dataset for the\nchallenging task of scientific diagram generation. Comprehensive experiments,\nincluding ablations, subjective and objective evaluations, and tests across\nuser expertise levels, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.\nNous achieves leading efficiency and output quality, while remaining robust to\nvarying user expertise. Moreover, its design is domain-agnostic, and we show\nevidence of generalization beyond diagram generation. Experimental results\nprove that our work offers a principled, scalable, and adaptive paradigm for\nresolving uncertainty about user intent in complex human-AI collaboration."}

Openness in MARL refers\nto the dynam-ic nature of agent populations, tasks, and agent types with-in a\nsystem. Specifically, there are three types of openness as reported in (Eck et\nal. 2023) [2]: agent openness, where agents can enter or leave the system at\nany time; task openness, where new tasks emerge, and existing ones evolve or\ndisappear; and type openness, where the capabil-ities and behaviors of agents\nchange over time. This report provides a conceptual and empirical review,\nfocusing on the interplay between openness and the credit assignment problem\n(CAP). CAP involves determining the contribution of individual agents to the\noverall system performance, a task that becomes increasingly complex in open\nenviron-ments. Traditional credit assignment (CA) methods often assume static\nagent populations, fixed and pre-defined tasks, and stationary types, making\nthem inadequate for open systems. We first conduct a conceptual analysis,\nin-troducing new sub-categories of openness to detail how events like agent\nturnover or task cancellation break the assumptions of environmental\nstationarity and fixed team composition that underpin existing CAP methods. We\nthen present an empirical study using representative temporal and structural\nalgorithms in an open environment. The results demonstrate that openness\ndirectly causes credit misattribution, evidenced by unstable loss functions and\nsignificant performance degradation."}

On the other hand, systems like Lean can guarantee\nverifiability, but are not well-suited to capture the nature of agentic\ndecision chain-based tasks. This creates a gap both in performance for\nfunctions such as business agents or code assistants, and in the usefulness of\nLLM reasoning benchmarks, whereby these fall short in reasoning structure or\nreal-world alignment. We introduce TempoBench, the first formally grounded and\nverifiable diagnostic benchmark that parametrizes difficulty to systematically\nanalyze how LLMs perform reasoning. TempoBench uses two evaluation benchmarks\nto break down reasoning ability. First, temporal trace evaluation (TTE) tests\nthe ability of an LLM to understand and simulate the execution of a given\nmulti-step reasoning system.

Bogdan contributed equally to this work, and\n  their listed order was determined by coinflip", "summary": "Most work interpreting reasoning models studies only a single\nchain-of-thought (CoT), yet these models define distributions over many\npossible CoTs. We argue that studying a single sample is inadequate for\nunderstanding causal influence and the underlying computation. Though fully\nspecifying this distribution is intractable, it can be understood by sampling.\nWe present case studies using resampling to investigate model decisions. First,\nwhen a model states a reason for its action, does that reason actually cause\nthe action? In \"agentic misalignment\" scenarios, we resample specific sentences\nto measure their downstream effects. Self-preservation sentences have small\ncausal impact, suggesting they do not meaningfully drive blackmail. Second, are\nartificial edits to CoT sufficient for steering reasoning? These are common in\nliterature, yet take the model off-policy. Resampling and selecting a\ncompletion with the desired property is a principled on-policy alternative. We\nfind off-policy interventions yield small and unstable effects compared to\nresampling in decision-making tasks. Third, how do we understand the effect of\nremoving a reasoning step when the model may repeat it post-edit? We introduce\na resilience metric that repeatedly resamples to prevent similar content from\nreappearing downstream. Critical planning statements resist removal but have\nlarge effects when eliminated. Fourth, since CoT is sometimes \"unfaithful\", can\nour methods teach us anything in these settings? Adapting causal mediation\nanalysis, we find that hints that have a causal effect on the output without\nbeing explicitly mentioned exert a subtle and cumulative influence on the CoT\nthat persists even if the hint is removed. Overall, studying distributions via\nresampling enables reliable causal analysis, clearer narratives of model\nreasoning, and principled CoT interventions."}

In this work, we\ninvestigate the applicability a recently proposed time series classification\nfoundation model, to a different EEG tasks such as motor imagery classification\nand sleep stage prediction. We test two pretraining regimes: (a) pretraining on\nheterogeneous real-world time series from multiple domains, and (b) pretraining\non purely synthetic data. We find that both variants yield strong performance,\nconsistently outperforming EEGNet, a widely used convolutional baseline, and\nCBraMod, the most recent EEG-specific foundation model. These results suggest\nthat generalist time series foundation models, even when pretrained on data of\nnon-neural origin or on synthetic signals, can transfer effectively to EEG. Our\nfindings highlight the promise of leveraging cross-domain pretrained models for\nbrain signal analysis, suggesting that EEG may benefit from advances in the\nbroader time series literature."}

As agents increasingly consume these\nservices, discovery becomes critical: which swap interface should an agent\ntrust? Which data provider is the most reliable? We introduce TraceRank, a\nreputation-weighted ranking algorithm where payment transactions serve as\nendorsements. TraceRank seeds addresses with precomputed reputation metrics and\npropagates reputation through payment flows weighted by transaction value and\ntemporal recency. Applied to x402's payment graph, this surfaces services\npreferred by high-reputation users rather than those with high transaction\nvolume. Our system combines TraceRank with semantic search to respond to\nnatural language queries with high quality results. We argue that reputation\npropagation resists Sybil attacks by making spam services with many\nlow-reputation payers rank below legitimate services with few high-reputation\npayers. Ultimately, we aim to construct a search method for x402 enabled\nservices that avoids infrastructure bias and has better performance than purely\nvolume based or semantic methods."}

Openness in MARL refers\nto the dynam-ic nature of agent populations, tasks, and agent types with-in a\nsystem. Specifically, there are three types of openness as reported in (Eck et\nal. 2023) [2]: agent openness, where agents can enter or leave the system at\nany time; task openness, where new tasks emerge, and existing ones evolve or\ndisappear; and type openness, where the capabil-ities and behaviors of agents\nchange over time. This report provides a conceptual and empirical review,\nfocusing on the interplay between openness and the credit assignment problem\n(CAP). CAP involves determining the contribution of individual agents to the\noverall system performance, a task that becomes increasingly complex in open\nenviron-ments. Traditional credit assignment (CA) methods often assume static\nagent populations, fixed and pre-defined tasks, and stationary types, making\nthem inadequate for open systems. We first conduct a conceptual analysis,\nin-troducing new sub-categories of openness to detail how events like agent\nturnover or task cancellation break the assumptions of environmental\nstationarity and fixed team composition that underpin existing CAP methods. We\nthen present an empirical study using representative temporal and structural\nalgorithms in an open environment. The results demonstrate that openness\ndirectly causes credit misattribution, evidenced by unstable loss functions and\nsignificant performance degradation."}
