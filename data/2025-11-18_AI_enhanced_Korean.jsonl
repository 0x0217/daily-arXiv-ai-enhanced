However, the emergence of powerful diffusion-based image generation and editing techniques poses a new threat to these watermarking schemes. In this paper, we investigate the intersection of diffusion-based image editing and robust image watermarking. We analyze how diffusion-driven image edits can significantly degrade or even fully remove embedded watermarks from state-of-the-art robust watermarking systems. Both theoretical formulations and empirical experiments are provided. We prove that as a image undergoes iterative diffusion transformations, the mutual information between the watermarked image and the embedded payload approaches zero, causing watermark decoding to fail. We further propose a guided diffusion attack algorithm that explicitly targets and erases watermark signals during generation. We evaluate our approach on recent deep learning-based watermarking schemes and demonstrate near-zero watermark recovery rates after attack, while maintaining high visual fidelity of the regenerated images. Finally, we discuss ethical implications of such watermark removal capablities and provide design guidelines for future watermarking strategies to be more resilient in the era of generative AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud655\uc0b0 \uae30\ubc18 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ud3b8\uc9d1 \uae30\uc220\uc774 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uac15\uc778\ud55c \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud0b9 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0, \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud06c \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc81c\uac70\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud655\uc0b0 \uae30\ubc18 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubc0f \ud3b8\uc9d1 \uae30\uc220\uc758 \ubd80\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uae30\uc874 \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud0b9 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uc704\ud611\ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uc758 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \ud655\uc0b0 \ubcc0\ud658\uc774 \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud06c\uc640 \uc0bd\uc785\ub41c \uc815\ubcf4 \uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc5bc\ub9c8\ub098 \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0, \uacf5\uaca9 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ucd5c\uadfc \ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud0b9 \uae30\ubc95\uc5d0\uc11c \uacf5\uaca9 \ud6c4 \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud06c \ubcf5\uad6c\uc728\uc774 \uac70\uc758 \uc81c\ub85c\uc5d0 \uac00\uae4c\uc6b4 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc0dd\uc131 AI \uc2dc\ub300\uc5d0 \ub354 \ud0c4\ub825\uc801\uc778 \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud0b9 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc124\uacc4 \uc9c0\uce68\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub4e4 \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud06c \uc81c\uac70 \ub2a5\ub825\uc758 \uc724\ub9ac\uc801 \ud568\uc758\ub97c \ub17c\uc758\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac15\ub825\ud55c \ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud0b9\uc740 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uc5d0 \uc228\uaca8\uc9c4 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc0bd\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud06c\uac00 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc870\uc791\uc744 \uacac\ub51c \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud655\uc0b0 \uae30\ubc18 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubc0f \ud3b8\uc9d1 \uae30\uc220\uc758 \ucd9c\ud604\uc740 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud0b9 \uccb4\uacc4\uc5d0 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc704\ud611\uc744 \uc81c\uae30\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud655\uc0b0 \uae30\ubc18 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ud3b8\uc9d1\uacfc \uac15\uc778\ud55c \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud0b9\uc758 \uad50\ucc28\uc810\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud655\uc0b0\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc720\ub3c4\ub41c \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ud3b8\uc9d1\uc774 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8\uc758 \uac15\uc778\ud55c \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud0b9 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0bd\uc785\ub41c \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uc5bc\ub9c8\ub098 \uc2ec\uac01\ud558\uac8c \uc800\ud558\uc2dc\ud0a4\uac70\ub098 \uc644\uc804\ud788 \uc81c\uac70\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc218\uc2dd\uacfc \uc2e4\uc99d \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc774 \uc81c\uacf5\ub41c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uac00 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \ud655\uc0b0 \ubcc0\ud658\uc744 \uac70\uce58\uba74\uc11c \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud06c\uac00 \uc801\uc6a9\ub41c \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uc640 \uc0bd\uc785\ub41c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \uc0c1\ud638 \uc815\ubcf4\uac00 0\uc5d0 \uac00\uae4c\uc6cc\uc838 \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud06c \ub514\ucf54\ub529\uc774 \uc2e4\ud328\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\uc5b4\uc11c \uc0dd\uc131 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud06c \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud0c0\uac9f\ud305\ud558\uace0 \uc81c\uac70\ud558\ub294 Guided Diffusion Attack \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ucd5c\uadfc \ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud0b9 \uae30\ubc95\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0, \uacf5\uaca9 \ud6c4 \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud06c \ubcf5\uad6c\uc728\uc774 \uac70\uc758 0\uc5d0 \uac00\uae4c\uc6b4 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc2dc\uc5f0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc7ac\uc0dd\ub41c \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uc758 \ub192\uc740 \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \ucda9\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud06c \uc81c\uac70 \ub2a5\ub825\uc758 \uc724\ub9ac\uc801 \ud568\uc758\ub97c \ub17c\uc758\ud558\uace0 \uc0dd\uc131 AI \uc2dc\ub300\uc5d0 \ub354 \ud0c4\ub825\uc801\uc778 \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud0b9 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc124\uacc4 \uc9c0\uce68\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

To examine the capability of LLMs in AVR, several vulnerability benchmarks have been proposed recently. However, they still suffer from key limitations of outdated vulnerabilities, limited language coverage, unreliable patch validation, and insufficient reproducibility. To overcome these challenges, we introduce PATCHEVAL, a multilingual benchmark for Go, JavaScript, and Python, languages for which existing benchmarks remain unexplored. PATCHEVAL curates a dataset of 1,000 vulnerabilities drawn from CVEs reported between 2015 and 2025, covering 65 distinct CWEs. A subset of 230 CVEs is further equipped with runtime sandbox environments, enabling patch verification through both security tests and functionality tests.

We analyzed eight attack scenarios in four categories: architectural attacks on convolutional neural networks, large language models, and reinforcement learning agents; infrastructure attacks exploiting federated learning and medical documentation systems; critical resource allocation attacks affecting organ transplantation and crisis triage; and supply chain attacks targeting commercial foundation models. Our findings indicate that attackers with access to only 100-500 samples can compromise healthcare AI regardless of dataset size, often achieving over 60 percent success, with detection taking an estimated 6 to 12 months or sometimes not occurring at all. The distributed nature of healthcare infrastructure creates many entry points where insiders with routine access can launch attacks with limited technical skill. Privacy laws such as HIPAA and GDPR can unintentionally shield attackers by restricting the analyses needed for detection. Supply chain weaknesses allow a single compromised vendor to poison models across 50 to 200 institutions. The Medical Scribe Sybil scenario shows how coordinated fake patient visits can poison data through legitimate clinical workflows without requiring a system breach.

In federated learning (FL), where data remains distributed across multiple parties during collaborative model training, normalization presents unique challenges due to the decentralized and often heterogeneous nature of the data. Traditional methods rely on either independent client-side processing, i.e., local normalization, or normalizing the entire dataset before distributing it to parties, i.e., pooled normalization. Local normalization can be problematic when data distributions across parties are non-IID, while the pooled normalization approach conflicts with the decentralized nature of FL. In this paper, we explore the adaptation of widely used normalization techniques to FL and define the term federated normalization. Federated normalization simulates pooled normalization by enabling the collaborative exchange of normalization parameters among parties. Thus, it achieves performance on par with pooled normalization without compromising data locality. However, sharing normalization parameters such as the mean introduces potential privacy risks, which we further mitigate through a robust privacy-preserving solution. Our contributions include: (i) We systematically evaluate the impact of various federated and local normalization techniques in heterogeneous FL scenarios, (ii) We propose a novel homomorphically encrypted $k$-th ranked element (and median) calculation tailored for the federated setting, enabling secure and efficient federated normalization, (iii) We propose privacy-preserving implementations of widely used normalization techniques for FL, leveraging multiparty fully homomorphic encryption (MHE).", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub370\uc774\ud130

While effective GUI agents synergistically integrate planning and grounding capabilities, current methodologies exhibit two fundamental limitations: (1) insufficient exploitation of cross-model synergies, and (2) over-reliance on synthetic data generation without sufficient utilization. To address these challenges, we propose Co-EPG, a self-iterative training framework for Co-Evolution of Planning and Grounding. Co-EPG establishes an iterative positive feedback loop: through this loop, the planning model explores superior strategies under grounding-based reward guidance via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), generating diverse data to optimize the grounding model. Concurrently, the optimized Grounding model provides more effective rewards for subsequent GRPO training of the planning model, fostering continuous improvement. Co-EPG thus enables iterative enhancement of agent capabilities through self-play optimization and training data distillation. On the Multimodal-Mind2Web and AndroidControl benchmarks, our framework outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods after just three iterations without requiring external data. The agent consistently improves with each iteration, demonstrating robust self-enhancement capabilities.

Greedy optimization methods, commonly used for LPC, alternate between clustering and linear regression but lack global optimality. While effective for separable clusters, they struggle in non-separable settings where clusters overlap in feature space. In an alternative constrained optimization paradigm, Bertsimas and Shioda (2007) formulated LPC as a Mixed-Integer Program (MIP), ensuring global optimality regardless of separability but suffering from poor scalability. This work builds on the constrained optimization paradigm to introduce two novel approaches that improve the efficiency of global optimization for LPC. By leveraging key theoretical properties of separability, we derive near-optimal approximations with provable error bounds, significantly reducing the MIP formulation's complexity and improving scalability. Additionally, we can further approximate LPC as a Quadratic Pseudo-Boolean Optimization (QPBO) problem, achieving substantial computational improvements in some settings. Comparative analyses on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our methods consistently achieve near-optimal solutions with substantially lower regression errors than greedy optimization while exhibiting superior scalability over existing MIP formulations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 Linear Predictive Clustering(LPC)\uc758 \uc804\uc5ed \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LPC\ub294 \ub9c8\ucf00\ud305, \uc758\ud559, \uad50\uc721 \ub4f1 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0 \uc751\uc6a9\ub418\uba70, \ud2b9\uc131 \ubcc0\uc778\uacfc \ud0c0\uac9f \ubcc0\uc778 \uac04\uc758 \uc120\ud615 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \ubd84\ud560\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 separability\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec LPC\uc758 \uc804\uc5ed \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ube44\uad50 \ubd84\uc11d \uacb0\uacfc \ubcf8 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc774 \uae30\uc874\uc758 greedy \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud604\uc800\ud55c \ud68c\uadc0 \uc624\ub958 \uac10\uc18c\uc640 \ud568\uaed8 \ub192\uc740 \uc804\uc5ed \ucd5c\uc801 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \uae30\ubc95\uc740 MIP \ud615\uc2dd\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc120\ud615 \uc608\uce21 \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130\ub9c1(LPC)\uc740 \ud2b9\uc131 \ubcc0\uc218\uc640 \ud0c0\uac9f \ubcc0\uc218 \uac04\uc758 \uacf5\uc720 \uc120\ud615 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \ubd84\ud560\ud558\uba70, \ub9c8\ucf00\ud305, \uc758\ud559, \uad50\uc721 \ub4f1 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc751\uc6a9 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud65c\uc6a9\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Either a single (central) authority verifies all the attributes, or multiple independent authorities verify the attributes distributedly. In the central setup, the authority verifies all user attributes, and the user downloads only the authorized record. While this is communication efficient, it reveals all user attributes to the authority. A distributed setup prevents this privacy breach by letting each authority verify and learn only one attribute. Motivated by this, Jafarpisheh~et~al. introduced an information-theoretic formulation, called distributed attribute-based private access control (DAPAC). With $N$ non-colluding authorities (servers), $N$ attributes and $K$ possible values for each attribute, the DAPAC system lets each server learn only the single attribute value that it verifies, and is oblivious to the remaining $N-1$. The user retrieves its designated record, without learning anything about the remaining database records. The goal is to maximize the rate, i.e., the ratio of desired message size to total download size. However, not all attributes are sensitive, and DAPAC's privacy constraints can be too restrictive, negatively affecting the rate. To leverage the heterogeneous privacy requirements of user attributes, we propose heterogeneous (Het)DAPAC, a framework which off-loads verification of $N-D$ of the $N$ attributes to a central server, and retains DAPAC's architecture for the $D$ sensitive attributes. We first present a HetDAPAC scheme, which improves the rate from $\\frac{1}{2K}$ to $\\frac{1}{K+1}$, while sacrificing the privacy of a few non-sensitive attributes. Unlike DAPAC, our scheme entails a download imbalance across servers; we propose a second scheme achieving a balanced per-server download and a rate of $\\frac{D+1}{2KD}$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc18d\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc138\ubc00\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \uc81c\uc5b4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c, \uc774\uc885 \uc18d\uc131 \uae30\ubc18 \uac1c\uc778 \uc811\uadfc \uc81c\uc5b4 (HetDAPAC) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc18d\uc131 \uae30\ubc18 \uc778\uc99d\uc5d0\uc11c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ubca0\uc774\uc2a4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc138\ubc00\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \uc81c\uc5b4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774\uc885 (Het)DAPAC \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 N-D\uc758 \uc18d\uc131 \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \uc911\uc559 \uc11c\ubc84\ub85c \uc624\ud504\ub85c\ub4dc\ud558\uace0 D\uac1c\uc758 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \uc18d\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574\uc11c\ub294 DAPAC\uc758 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "HetDAPAC \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ube44\ubc00 \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \uba87 \uac1c \ud76c\uc0dd\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ube44\uc728\uc744 1/2K\uc5d0\uc11c 1/(K+1)\ub85c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub450 \ubc88\uc9f8 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc11c\ubc84 \uac04 \uade0\ud615 \uc7a1\ud78c \ub2e4\uc6b4\ub85c\ub4dc\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ube44\uc728\uc744 (D+1)/(2KD)\ub85c \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc18d\uc131 \uac80\uc99d\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ubca0\uc774\uc2a4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc138\ubc00\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \uc81c\uc5b4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uae30\ubcf8\uc774\ub2e4. \ub2e8\uc77c(\uc911\uc559) \uad8c\ud55c\uc774 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uac1c\uc758 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \uad8c\ud55c\uc774 \ubd84\uc0b0\ub418\uc5b4 \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc911\uc559 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uad8c\ud55c\uc774 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uace0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\ub294 \uc2b9\uc778\ub41c \ub808\ucf54\ub4dc\ub9cc \ub2e4\uc6b4\ub85c\ub4dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ubc18\uba74, \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \uad8c\ud55c\uc5d0 \ub178\ucd9c\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4. \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc124\uc815\uc740 \uac01 \uad8c\ud55c\uc774 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc18d\uc131\ub9cc \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uace0 \ub098\uba38\uc9c0 \uc18d\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc54c\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uac1c\uc778\uc815\ubcf4 \uce68\ud574\ub97c \ubc29\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c Jafarpisheh \uc678\ub294 \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc18d\uc131 \uae30\ubc18 \uac1c\uc778 \uc811\uadfc \uc81c\uc5b4(DAPAC)\ub77c\ub294 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.

Evaluation-Aligned Training Signals for Multi-LLM Agents", "comment": null, "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) in multi-agent systems (MAS) have shown promise for complex tasks, yet current training methods lack principled ways to connect system-level evaluation with agent-level and message-level learning. We propose a theoretical framework that unifies cooperative game-theoretic attribution with process reward modeling to transform system evaluation into agent credit and then into response-level signals. Unlike prior approaches that rely only on attribution (e.g., Shapley) or step-level labels (e.g., PRM), our method produces local, signed, and credit-conserving signals. In success cases, Shapley-based credit assignment fairly allocates outcomes across agents and is refined into per-message rewards that promote cooperation while discouraging redundancy or sabotage. In failure cases, first-error localization yields repair-aware preferences that penalize harmful steps while rewarding corrective attempts. The resulting signals are bounded, cooperative, and directly compatible with reinforcement-based or preference-based post-training, providing a unified and auditable pathway from global evaluation to local supervision in LLM multi-agent training. Our contribution is conceptual: we present a theoretical foundation and training signals, leaving empirical validation for future work.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911

Goodall", "Edwin Hamel-De le Court", "Francesco Belardinelli"], "title": "Behaviour Policy Optimization: Provably Lower Variance Return Estimates for Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning", "comment": "Accepted at AAAI 2026 (main track)", "summary": "Many reinforcement learning algorithms, particularly those that rely on return estimates for policy improvement, can suffer from poor sample efficiency and training instability due to high-variance return estimates. In this paper we leverage new results from off-policy evaluation; it has recently been shown that well-designed behaviour policies can be used to collect off-policy data for provably lower variance return estimates. This result is surprising as it means collecting data on-policy is not variance optimal. We extend this key insight to the online reinforcement learning setting, where both policy evaluation and improvement are interleaved to learn optimal policies. Off-policy RL has been well studied (e.g., IMPALA), with correct and truncated importance weighted samples for de-biasing and managing variance appropriately. Generally these approaches are concerned with reconciling data collected from multiple workers in parallel, while the policy is updated asynchronously, mismatch between the workers and policy is corrected in a mathematically sound way. Here we consider only one worker - the behaviour policy, which is used to collect data for policy improvement, with provably lower variance return estimates. In our experiments we extend two policy-gradient methods with this regime, demonstrating better sample efficiency and performance over a diverse set of environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \ud559\uc2b5 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc624\ud504-\uc815\ucc45 \ud3c9\uac00 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc815\ucc45 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc218\uc775 \ucd94\uc815\uce58\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294 \ub9ce\uc740 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc774 \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc774 \ub0ae\uace0 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubd88\uc548\uc815\uc131\uc5d0 \uc2dc\ub2ec\ub9b4 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc624\ud504-\uc815\ucc45 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc218\uc9d1\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc798 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \ud589\ub3d9 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub354 \ub0ae\uc740 \ubd84\uc0b0\uc758 \uc218\uc775 \ucd94\uc815\uce58\ub97c \uc5bb\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc815\ucc45 \uacbd\ub7c9\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud655\uc7a5\ud588\uc73c\uba70, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub428\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc791\uc5c5\uc790\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc815\ucc45 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc218\uc9d1\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ubd84\uc0b0\uc744 \ub0ae\ucd9c \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub9ce\uc740 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998, \ud2b9\ud788 \uc815\ucc45 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc218\uc775 \ucd94\uc815\uce58\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \ub192\uc740 \ubd84\uc0b0\uc758 \uc218\uc775 \ucd94\uc815\uce58\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \ud6c8\ub828 \ubd88\uc548\uc815\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc624\ud504-\uc815\ucc45 \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uba70, \ucd5c\uadfc \uc798 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \ud589\ub3d9 \uc815\ucc45\uc774 \uc218\uc775 \ucd94\uc815\uce58\uc758 \ubd84\uc0b0\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc624\ud504-\uc815\ucc45 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc218\uc9d1\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc218\uc9d1\uc774 \uc815\ucc45 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \ubd84\uc0b0\uc774 \uc544\ub2d8\uc744 \uc758\ubbf8\ud558\ub294 \ub180\ub77c\uc6b4 \uacb0\uacfc\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \ud575\uc2ec \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc124\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\ucc45 \ud3c9\uac00\uc640 \uac1c\uc120\uc774 \uc11c\ub85c \uc5bd\ud788\uba70 \ucd5c\uc801 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc624\ud504-\uc815\ucc45 RL\uc740 \uc798 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub418\uc5b4 \uc654\uc73c\uba70(\uc608: IMPALA), \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \uc81c\uac70\ud558\uace0 \ubd84\uc0b0\uc744 \uc801\uc808\ud558\uac8c \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc815\ud655\ud558\uace0 \uc798\ub9ac\uae30 \ucc98\ub9ac\uac00 \ub41c \uc911\uc694\ub3c4 \uac00\uc911 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ube44\ub3d9\uae30\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub418\ub294 \uc815\ucc45\uacfc \ubcd1\ub82c\ub85c \uc218\uc9d1\ub41c \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc791\uc5c5\uc790 \uac04\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc870\ud654\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8f9\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc815\ucc45 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc218\uc9d1\uc5d0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc815\ucc45\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc791\uc5c5\uc790\ub9cc\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc785\uc99d\ub41c \ub354 \ub0ae\uc740 \ubd84\uc0b0\uc758 \uc218\uc775 \ucd94\uc815\uce58\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774 \uccb4\uc81c\ub97c \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc815\ucc45-\uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Code available at https://github.com/microsoft/SafeAgents", "summary": "LLM-based agents are increasingly deployed in multi-agent systems (MAS). As these systems move toward real-world applications, their security becomes paramount. Existing research largely evaluates single-agent security, leaving a critical gap in understanding the vulnerabilities introduced by multi-agent design. However, existing systems fall short due to lack of unified frameworks and metrics focusing on unique rejection modes in MAS. We present SafeAgents, a unified and extensible framework for fine-grained security assessment of MAS. SafeAgents systematically exposes how design choices such as plan construction strategies, inter-agent context sharing, and fallback behaviors affect susceptibility to adversarial prompting. We introduce Dharma, a diagnostic measure that helps identify weak links within multi-agent pipelines. Using SafeAgents, we conduct a comprehensive study across five widely adopted multi-agent architectures (centralized, decentralized, and hybrid variants) on four datasets spanning web tasks, tool use, and code generation. Our findings reveal that common design patterns carry significant vulnerabilities. For example, centralized systems that delegate only atomic instructions to sub-agents obscure harmful objectives, reducing robustness. Our results highlight the need for security-aware design in MAS.

This study develops a multi-agent AI framework that reconstructs pre-crash scenarios and infers vehicle behaviors from fragmented collision data. We present a two-phase collaborative framework combining reconstruction and reasoning phases. The system processes 277 rear-end lead vehicle deceleration (LVD) collisions from the Crash Investigation Sampling System, integrating textual crash reports, structured tabular data, and visual scene diagrams. Phase I generates natural-language crash reconstructions from multimodal inputs. Phase II performs in-depth crash reasoning by combining these reconstructions with temporal Event Data Recorder (EDR).For validation, we applied it to all LVD cases, focusing on a subset of 39 complex crashes where multiple EDR records per collision introduced ambiguity (e.g., due to missing or conflicting data).The evaluation of the 39 LVD crash cases revealed our framework achieved perfect accuracy across all test cases, successfully identifying both the most relevant EDR event and correctly distinguishing striking versus struck vehicles, surpassing the 92% accuracy achieved by human researchers on the same challenging dataset. The system maintained robust performance even when processing incomplete data, including missing or erroneous EDR records and ambiguous scene diagrams.

However, existing approaches typically rely on domain-specific knowledge to construct these graphs, limiting their applicability to new tasks. Other graph-based approaches create graphs dynamically during exploration but struggle to fully utilize them, because they have problems passing the information in the graphs to newly visited states. Additionally, current GCHRL methods face challenges such as sample inefficiency and poor subgoal representation. This paper proposes a solution to these issues by developing a graph encoder-decoder to evaluate unseen states. Our proposed method, Graph-Guided sub-Goal representation Generation RL (G4RL), can be incorporated into any existing GCHRL method when operating in environments with primarily symmetric and reversible transitions to enhance performance across this class of problems. We show that the graph encoder-decoder can be effectively implemented using a network trained on the state graph generated during exploration. Empirical results indicate that leveraging high and low-level intrinsic rewards from the graph encoder-decoder significantly enhances the performance of state-of-the-art GCHRL approaches with an extra small computational cost in dense and sparse reward environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc640 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc870\uac74 \uacc4\uce35 \uac15\ud654

However, true personalization requires adapting to learners' complex knowledge states (multi-source) and diverse goals (multi-sink); existing ITSs often lack the necessary structural-reasoning capability and knowledge dynamism to generate genuinely effective learning paths, and they lack scientifically rigorous validation paradigms. In this paper we propose GraphMASAL (A Graph-based Multi-Agent System for Adaptive Learning), which integrates (i) a dynamic knowledge graph for persistent, stateful learner modeling; (ii) a LangGraph-orchestrated trio of agents (Diagnostician, Planner, Tutor); (iii) a knowledge-graph-grounded two-stage neural IR component (dual-encoder dense retrieval with cross-encoder listwise re-ranking and calibrated score fusion); and (iv) a multi-source multi-sink (MSMS) planning engine with a cognitively grounded cost and an approximation guarantee via greedy set cover. Under blinded automated evaluations with matched inputs and inference settings across diverse student profiles, GraphMASAL consistently outperforms LLM prompting and structured ablations in planning--achieving stronger structural/sequence alignment of learning paths, higher coverage of weak concepts, and lower learning cost--while also surpassing prompt-based baselines in cognitive diagnosis. Agreement with expert/LLM-proxy ratings further supports the validity of our evaluation protocol. These findings indicate that grounding LLM agents in a dynamic knowledge graph, coupled with optimization under educational constraints, yields reliable, interpretable, and pedagogically plausible learning plans, advancing personalized and goal-oriented education.", "AI": {"tldr": "GraphMASAL\uc740 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc640 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8

To support the creation of dynamic planning units, we introduce a planning support system with agentic AI that enables users to generate demand-oriented regions for disaster planning, integrating the human-in-the-loop principle for transparency and adaptability. The platform is built on a representative initialized spatially constrained self-organizing map (RepSC-SOM), extending traditional SOM with adaptive geographic filtering and region-growing refinement, while AI agents can reason, plan, and act to guide the process by suggesting input features, guiding spatial constraints, and supporting interactive exploration. We demonstrate the capabilities of the platform through a case study on the flooding-related risk in Jacksonville, Florida, showing how it allows users to explore, generate, and evaluate

It focuses on the generalization ability of agents, requiring them to coordinate well with collaborators that are not seen before without any fine-tuning. Population-based training has been proven to provide good zero-shot coordination performance; nevertheless, existing methods are limited by computational resources, mainly focusing on optimizing diversity in small populations while neglecting the potential performance gains from scaling population size. To address this issue, this paper proposes the Scalable Population Training (ScaPT), an efficient training framework comprising two key components: a meta-agent that efficiently realizes a population by selectively sharing parameters across agents, and a mutual information regularizer that guarantees population diversity. To empirically validate the effectiveness of ScaPT, this paper evaluates it along with representational frameworks in Hanabi and confirms its superiority.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7 \ud611\ub3d9(ZSC)\uc740 \ucd5c\uadfc \uac15\ud654\ud559\uc2b5 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc8fc\ubaa9\ubc1b\ub294 \uc8fc\uc81c\ub85c, \uc774\uc804\uc5d0 \ubcf4\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c \ud611\ub825\uc790\uc640\uc758 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ub2a5\ub825\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc774 \uc18c\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc5d0 \uc911\uc810\uc744 \ub450\uace0 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc778\uad6c \uaddc\ubaa8 \ud655\ub300\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uac04\uacfc\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0, \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 Scalable Population Training (ScaPT)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uba54\ud0c0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc5d0 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uc120\ud0dd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uacf5\uc720\ud558\uc5ec \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\uad6c\ub97c \uc2e4\ud604\ud558\uace0, \uc778\uad6c\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc815\uaddc\ud654\uae30\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \uac16\ucd98 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uad50\uc721 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 ScaPT\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "ScaPT\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc2e4\uc99d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, Hanabi\uc5d0\uc11c \ub300\ud45c\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub4e4\uacfc \ud568\uaed8 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uadf8 \uc6b0\uc218\uc131\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uacb0\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, ScaPT\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7 \ud611\ub3d9 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7 \ud611\ub3d9(ZSC)\uc740 \ucd5c\uadfc \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc8fc\ubaa9\ubc1b\ub294 \uc8fc\uc81c\ub85c, \uc774\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ub2a5\ub825\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uba70, \uc0ac\uc804 \uc870\uc815 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc774\uc804\uc5d0 \ubcf4\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c \ud611\ub825\uc790\uc640 \uc798 \ud611\ub825\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubaa8\uc9d1\ub2e8 \uae30\ubc18 \ud6c8\ub828\uc740 \uc88b\uc740 \uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7 \ud611\ub3d9 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \uc785\uc99d\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\ub098, \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uc8fc\ub85c \uc791\uc740 \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\ud558\uba70, \uc778\uad6c \uaddc\ubaa8 \ud655\ub300\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uac04\uacfc\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc120\ud0dd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uacf5\uc720\ud558\uc5ec \uc778\uad6c\ub97c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2e4\ud604\ud558\ub294 \uba54\ud0c0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \uc778\uad6c \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc815\uaddc\ud654\uae30\ub77c\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub85c \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc9c4 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud6c8\ub828 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Scalable Population Training (ScaPT)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

Although the Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) paradigm offers a promising solution by promoting consensus among multiple agents to enhance reliability, it relies on the unrealistic assumption that all debaters are rational and reflective, which is a condition that may not hold when agents themselves are prone to hallucinations. To address this gap, we introduce the Multi-agent Undercover Gaming (MUG) protocol, inspired by social deduction games like \"Who is Undercover?\". MUG reframes MAD as a process of detecting \"undercover\" agents (those suffering from hallucinations) by employing multimodal counterfactual tests. Specifically, we modify reference images to introduce counterfactual evidence and observe whether agents can accurately identify these changes, providing ground-truth for identifying hallucinating agents and enabling robust, crowd-powered multimodal reasoning. MUG advances MAD protocols along three key dimensions: (1) enabling factual verification beyond statistical consensus through counterfactual testing; (2) introducing cross-evidence reasoning via dynamically modified evidence sources instead of relying on static inputs; and (3) fostering active reasoning, where agents engage in probing discussions rather than passively answering questions.

For example, pathophysiological models of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) typically describe how variables, such as regional levels of toxic proteins, interact spatiotemporally within a dynamical system driven by an underlying biological substrate, often based on brain connectivity. However, current methods grossly oversimplify the complex relationship between brain connectivity by assuming a single-modality brain connectome as the disease-spreading substrate. This leads to inaccurate predictions of pathology spread, especially during the long-term progression period. Meanhwile, other methods of learning such a graph in a purely data-driven way face the identifiability issue due to lack of proper constraint. We thus present a novel framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) as expert guides on the interaction of regional variables to enhance learning of disease progression from irregularly sampled longitudinal patient data. By leveraging LLMs' ability to synthesize multi-modal relationships and incorporate diverse disease-driving mechanisms, our method simultaneously optimizes 1) the construction of long-term disease trajectories from individual-level observations and 2) the biologically-constrained graph structure that captures interactions among brain regions with better identifiability. We demonstrate the new approach by estimating the pathology propagation using tau-PET imaging data from an Alzheimer's disease cohort. The new framework demonstrates superior prediction accuracy and interpretability compared to traditional approaches while revealing additional disease-driving factors beyond conventional connectivity measures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc2e0\uacbd\ud1f4\ud589\uc131 \uc9c8\ud658 \ub3d9\uc548 \ub1cc \uc601\uc5ed \uac04 \ubc14\uc774\uc624\ub9c8\ucee4 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2e0\uacbd\ud1f4\ud589\uc131 \uc9c8\ud658\uc758 \uc9c4\ud589 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubd88\uaddc\uce59\ud558\uac8c \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\ub41c \ud658\uc790 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc9c8\ubcd1 \uc9c4\ud589 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc54c\uce20\ud558\uc774\uba38 \uc9c8\ud658 \ud658\uc790 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ud0c0\uc6b0-PET \uc774\ubbf8\uc9d5 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubcd1\ub9ac \uc804\ud30c\ub97c \ucd94\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ud6a8\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc640 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc2e0\uacbd\ud1f4\ud589\uc131 \uc9c8\ud658 \ub3d9\uc548 \ub1cc \uc601\uc5ed \uac04 \ubc14\uc774\uc624\ub9c8\ucee4\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc9c8\ubcd1 \uc9c4\ud589\uc758 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ubc1d\ud600\ub0b4\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc608\ub97c \ub4e4\uc5b4, \uc54c\uce20\ud558\uc774\uba38\ubcd1(AD)\uc758 \ubcd1\ud0dc\uc0dd\ub9ac\ud559\uc801 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub3c5\uc131 \ub2e8\ubc31\uc9c8\uc758 \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc801 \uc218\uc900\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ubcc0\uc218\ub4e4\uc774 \uae30\ubcf8 \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801 \uae30\uc9c8\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uad6c\ub3d9\ub418\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\uacf5\uac04\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc124\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ud604\uc7ac \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \ub2e8\uc77c \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0 \ub1cc \uc5f0\uacb0\ub9dd\uc744 \uc9c8\ubcd1 \uc804\ud30c \uae30\uc9c8\ub85c \uac00\uc815\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ub1cc \uc5f0\uacb0\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uc9c0\ub098\uce58\uac8c \ub2e8\uc21c\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uac83\uc740 \ud2b9\ud788 \uc7a5\uae30 \uc9c4\ud589 \uae30\uac04 \ub3d9\uc548 \ubcd1\ub9ac \uc804\ud30c\uc758 \ubd80\uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc608\uce21\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc9d1\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud55c\ud3b8, \uc21c\uc218\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc801\uc808\ud55c \uc81c\uc57d\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uc5ec \uc2dd\ubcc4 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc9c0\uc5ed \ubcc0\uc218 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uac00\uc774\ub4dc\ub85c\uc11c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uc5ec \ubd88\uaddc\uce59\ud558\uac8c \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\ub41c \uc7a5\uae30 \ud658\uc790 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc9c8\ubcd1 \uc9c4\ud589\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

The Sindy algorithm has proven effective in leveraging sparsity to identify concise models of nonlinear dynamical systems. In this paper, we extend sparsity-driven approaches to real-time learning by integrating a cornerstone algorithm from control theory -- the Kalman filter (KF). The resulting Sindy Kalman Filter (SKF) unifies both frameworks by treating unknown system parameters as state variables, enabling real-time inference of complex, time-varying nonlinear models unattainable by either method alone. Furthermore, SKF enhances KF parameter identification strategies, particularly via look-ahead error, significantly simplifying the estimation of sparsity levels, variance parameters, and switching instants. We validate SKF on a chaotic Lorenz system with drifting or switching parameters and demonstrate its effectiveness in the real-time identification of a sparse nonlinear aircraft model built from real flight data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 Sindy Kalman Filter (SKF)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \ube44\uc120\ud615 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubb3c\ub9ac \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c0\ubc30 \ubc29\uc815\uc2dd\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "Kalman \ud544\ud130\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud76c\uc18c \uae30\ubc18 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ud655\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "Sindy Kalman Filter (SKF)\ub294 \ube44\uc120\ud615 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\ub860\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "SKF\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \ube44\ud589 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \ud76c\uc18c \ube44\uc120\ud615 \ud56d\uacf5\uae30 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dd\ubcc4\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c0\ubc30 \ubc29\uc815\uc2dd\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ubb3c\ub9ac \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud558\uba70, \ubb3c\ub9ac\ud559, \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559 \ubc0f \uacf5\ud559\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uacfc\ud559 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc751\uc6a9\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Evaluated on a stratified dataset of 200 Amended APPI Article 16 cases with clearly defined ground truth labels and multiple performance metrics, the system achieves 72% accuracy, which is 21 percentage points higher than a single-agent baseline, including 90% accuracy on clear compliance cases (vs. 16% for the baseline) while maintaining perfect detection of clear violations.

The rapid development of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has established them as one of the mainstream approaches for multi-view clustering. Despite significant progress in GNNs-based IMVC, some challenges remain: (1) Most methods rely on the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to construct static graphs from raw data, which introduces noise and diminishes the robustness of the graph topology. (2) Existing methods typically utilize the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss between the reconstructed graph and the sparse adjacency graph directly as the graph reconstruction loss, leading to substantial gradient noise during optimization. To address these issues, we propose a novel \\textbf{D}ynamic Deep \\textbf{G}raph Learning for \\textbf{I}ncomplete \\textbf{M}ulti-\\textbf{V}iew \\textbf{C}lustering with \\textbf{M}asked Graph Reconstruction Loss (DGIMVCM). Firstly, we construct a missing-robust global graph from the raw data. A graph convolutional embedding layer is then designed to extract primary features and refined dynamic view-specific graph structures, leveraging the global graph for imputation of missing views. This process is complemented by graph structure contrastive learning, which identifies consistency among view-specific graph structures. Secondly, a graph self-attention encoder is introduced to extract high-level representations based on the imputed primary features and view-specific graphs, and is optimized with a masked graph reconstruction loss to mitigate gradient noise during optimization.

Despite extensive training, these systems will inevitably encounter scenarios where no available course of action fully satisfies all operational constraints (e.g., operating procedures, rules, laws, norms, and goals). To achieve goals in accordance with human expectations and values, agents must go beyond their trained policies and instead construct, evaluate, and justify candidate courses of action. These processes require contextual \"knowledge\" that may lie outside prior (policy) training. This paper characterizes requirements for agent decision making in these contexts. It also identifies the types of knowledge agents require to make decisions robust to agent goals and aligned with human expectations. Drawing on both analysis and empirical case studies, we examine how agents need to integrate normative, pragmatic, and situational understanding to select and then to pursue more aligned courses of action in complex, real-world environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc790\uc728 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0\uc11c \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ub0b4\ub9ac\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc694\uad6c\uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \uaddc\uba85\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc790\uc728 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc815\ucc45\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0 \ub9de\ub294 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ub0b4\ub9b4 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubd84\uc11d\uacfc \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \uc0ac\ub840 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ub0b4\ub9ac\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc5d0 \ub9de\uace0 \uc778\uac04 \uae30\ub300\uc5d0 aligned\ub41c \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc720\ud615\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0 \ub9de\ub294 \uc774\ud574\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ub354 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \ud589\ub3d9 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc120\ud0dd\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubc30\uce58\ub41c \uc790\uc728 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uc0c8\ub86d\uac70\ub098 \ubd88\uba85\ud655\ud55c \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5ec\ub7ec \uadf8\ub7f4\ub4ef\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9 \uacbd\ub85c(\ud655\uc7a5\ub41c \ud589\ub3d9 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4)\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud574\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \ud6c8\ub828\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc6b4\uc601 \uc808\ucc28, \uaddc\uce59, \ubc95\ub960, \uaddc\ubc94 \ubc0f \ubaa9\ud45c\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc6b4\uc601 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \uc644\uc804\ud788 \ucda9\uc871\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ub85c\uac00 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud558\uac8c \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uae30\ub300\uc640 \uac00\uce58\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ub118\uc5b4 \ud6c4\ubcf4 \ud589\ub3d9 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uace0 \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc0f \uc815\ub2f9\ud654\ud574\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\ub294 \uc774\uc804\uc758 \uc815\ucc45 \uad50\uc721\uc744 \ub118\uc5b4\uc11c\ub294 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc801 \"\uc9c0\uc2dd\"\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc9d3\uace0, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc5d0 \uacac\uace0\ud558\uace0 \uc778\uac04 \uae30\ub300\uc5d0 \ubd80\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ub0b4\ub9ac\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc720\ud615\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubd84\uc11d\uacfc \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \uc0ac\ub840 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc2e4\uc81c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ub354 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \ud589\ub3d9 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\uace0 \ucd94\uad6c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uaddc\ubc94\uc801, \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801, \uc0c1\ud669 \uc774\ud574\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud574\uc57c \ud568\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Conventional backpropagation (BP)-based training requires storing layer activations and optimizer states, a demand that can be only partially alleviated through checkpointing. In edge deployments in which the model weights must reside entirely in device memory, this overhead severely limits the maximum model size that can be deployed. Memory-efficient zeroth-order optimization (MeZO) alleviates this bottleneck by estimating gradients using forward evaluations alone, eliminating the need for storing intermediate activations or optimizer states. This enables significantly larger models to fit within on-chip memory, albeit at the cost of potentially longer fine-tuning wall-clock time. This paper first provides a theoretical estimate of the relative model sizes that can be accommodated under BP and MeZO training.

Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offer a structured, interpretable format to organize such data, yet constructing product-specific KGs remains a complex and manual process. This paper introduces a fully automated, AI agent-driven framework for constructing product knowledge graphs directly from unstructured product descriptions. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), our method operates in three stages using dedicated agents: ontology creation and expansion, ontology refinement, and knowledge graph population. This agent-based approach ensures semantic coherence, scalability, and high-quality output without relying on predefined schemas or handcrafted extraction rules. We evaluate the system on a real-world dataset of air conditioner product descriptions, demonstrating strong performance in both ontology generation and KG population. The framework achieves over 97\\% property coverage and minimal redundancy, validating its effectiveness and practical applicability. Our work highlights the potential of LLMs to automate structured knowledge extraction in retail, providing a scalable path toward intelligent product data integration and utilization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ube44\uc815\ud615 \uc81c\ud488 \uc124\uba85\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\ud488 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\ub294 AI \uae30\ubc18 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc774\ucee4\uba38\uc2a4 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc758 \uae09\uc18d\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5\uc740 \ubc29\ub300\ud55c \uc591\uc758 \ube44\uc815\ud615 \uc81c\ud488 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc815\ubcf4 \uac80\uc0c9, \ucd94\ucc9c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ubc0f \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0 \ud070 \ub3c4\uc804\uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc804\uc6a9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub2e8\uacc4(\uc628\ud1a8\ub85c\uc9c0 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubc0f \ud655\uc7a5, \uc628\ud1a8\ub85c\uc9c0 \uc218\uc815, \uc9c0\uc2dd \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uad6c\ucd95)\ub85c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\ub294 \uc644\uc804 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc5d0\uc5b4\ucee8 \uc81c\ud488 \uc124\uba85\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uc628\ud1a8\ub85c\uc9c0 \uc0dd\uc131\uacfc KG \uad6c\ucd95 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 97% \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uc18d\uc131 \ucee4\ubc84\ub9ac\uc9c0\uc640 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud55c\uc758 \uc911\ubcf5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uacfc \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Leveraging the Voigt-Reuss bounds, we factor their difference via a Cholesky-like operator and learn a dimensionless, symmetric positive semi-definite representation with eigenvalues in $[0,1]$; the inverse map returns symmetric positive-definite predictions that lie between the bounds in the L\u00f6wner sense. In 3D linear elasticity on an open dataset of stochastic biphasic microstructures, a fully connected Voigt-Reuss net trained on $>\\!7.5\\times 10^{5}$ FFT-based labels with 236 isotropy-invariant descriptors and three contrast parameters recovers the isotropic projection with near-perfect fidelity (isotropy-related entries: $R^2 \\ge 0.998$), while anisotropy-revealing couplings are unidentifiable from $SO(3)$-invariant inputs. Tensor-level relative Frobenius errors have median $\\approx 1.7\\%$ and mean $\\approx 3.4\\%$ across splits. For 2D plane strain on thresholded trigonometric microstructures, coupling spectral normalization with a differentiable renderer and a CNN yields $R^2>0.99$ on all components, subpercent normalized losses, accurate tracking of percolation-induced eigenvalue jumps, and robust generalization to out-of-distribution images. Treating the parametric microstructure as design variables, batched first-order optimization with a single surrogate matches target tensors within a few percent and returns diverse near-optimal designs. Overall, the Voigt-Reuss net unifies accurate, physically admissible forward prediction with large-batch, constraint-consistent inverse design, and is generic to elliptic operators and coupled-physics settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uacbd\ub7c9 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uac16\ucd98 \uc804\ubc29 \ubc0f \uc5ed \uae30\uacc4 \uade0\uc9c8\ud654\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7f4 \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \ub300\ub9ac \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uacbd\ub7c9 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \uae30\uacc4 \uade0\uc9c8\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \ub290\uaf08\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "Voigt-Reuss \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ucc28\uc774\ub97c Cholesky \uc720\uc0ac \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc790\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ubd84\ud574\ud558\uace0, \uace0\uc720\uac12\uc774 $[0,1]$\uc778 \ubb34\ucc28\uc6d0 \ub300\uce6d \uc591\uc758 \ubc18\uc815\uc801 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "3D \uc120\ud615 \ud0c4\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574, \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c Voigt-Reuss \ub124\ud2b8\ub294 \uac70\uc758 \uc644\ubcbd\ud55c \ucda9\uc2e4\ub3c4\ub85c \ub3d9\ub960 \ud22c\uc601\uc744 \ud68c\ubcf5\ud558\uace0, \ud150\uc11c \uc218\uc900\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc0c1\ub300 Frobenius \uc624\ub958\uac00 \ubd84\ud560\uc5d0\uc11c \uac01\uac01 \ub300\ub7b5 $1.7\\\\%$\uc640 $3.4\\\\%$\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Voigt-Reuss \ub124\ud2b8\ub294 \uc815\ud655\ud558\uace0 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud5c8\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc804\ubc29 \uc608\uce21\uacfc \ub300\ub7c9 \ubc30\uce58, \uc81c\uc57d \uc77c\uce58 \uc5ed\uc124\uacc4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uba70, \ud0c0\uc6d0 \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc790 \ubc0f \uacb0\ud569 \ubb3c\ub9ac \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uac16\ucd98 \uc804\ubc29 \ubc0f \uc5ed \uae30\uacc4 \uade0\uc9c8\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7f4 \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \ub300\ub9ac\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, the critical aspect of role allocation strategies remains underexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that allocating roles with differing viewpoints to specific positions significantly impacts MAD's performance in reasoning tasks. Specifically, we find a novel role allocation strategy, \"Truth Last\", which can improve MAD performance by up to 22% in reasoning tasks. To address the issue of unknown truth in practical applications, we propose the Multi-Agent Debate Consistency (MADC) strategy, which systematically simulates and optimizes its core mechanisms. MADC incorporates path consistency to assess agreement among independent roles, simulating the role with the highest consistency score as the truth. We validated MADC across a range of LLMs (9 models), including the DeepSeek-R1 Distilled Models, on challenging reasoning tasks.

While reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in individual astrodynamics tasks, existing approaches often require separate policies for distinct mission phases, limiting adaptability and increasing operational complexity. This work introduces a transformer-based RL framework that unifies multi-phase trajectory optimization through a single policy architecture, leveraging the transformer's inherent capacity to model extended temporal contexts. Building on proximal policy optimization (PPO), our framework replaces conventional recurrent networks with a transformer encoder-decoder structure, enabling the agent to maintain coherent memory across mission phases spanning seconds to minutes during critical operations. By integrating a Gated Transformer-XL (GTrXL) architecture, the framework eliminates manual phase transitions while maintaining stability in control decisions. We validate our approach progressively: first demonstrating near-optimal performance on single-phase benchmarks (double integrator and Van der Pol oscillator), then extending to multiphase waypoint navigation variants, and finally tackling a complex multiphase rocket ascent problem that includes atmospheric flight, stage separation, and vacuum operations. Results demonstrate that the transformer-based framework not only matches analytical solutions in simple cases but also effectively learns coherent control policies across dynamically distinct regimes, establishing a foundation for scalable autonomous mission planning that reduces reliance on phase-specific controllers while maintaining compatibility with safety-critical verification protocols.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc784\ubb34\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30 \uae30\ubc18 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc790\uc728 \uc6b0\uc8fc\uc120 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc784\ubb34 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \ub3d9\uc801 \uc815\ucc45\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "PPO\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uc5ec, \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc21c\ud658 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc744 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30 \uc778\ucf54\ub354-\ub514\ucf54\ub354 \uad6c\uc870\ub85c \ub300\uccb4\ud558\uc5ec \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc784\ubb34 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uae30\uc5b5\uc744 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uc720\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e8\uc77c \ub2e8\uacc4 \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc5d0\uc11c \uac70\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uace0, \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc6e8\uc774\ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ub85c\ucf13 \uc0c1\uc2b9 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubcc0\ud658\uae30 \uae30\ubc18 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ubd84\uc11d \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uacfc \uc77c\uce58\ud558\uba70, \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\ubcc4\ub41c \uc601\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uc5ec \uc790\uc728 \uc784\ubb34 \uacc4\ud68d\uc758 \uae30\ubc18\uc744 \ub9c8\ub828\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc790\uc728 \uc6b0\uc8fc\uc120 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub294 \ubc1c\uc0ac, \uc0c1\uc2b9, \ub2e8\uacc4 \ubd84\ub9ac \ubc0f \uada4\ub3c4 \uc0bd\uc785\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc784\ubb34 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc815\ucc45\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc774 \uac1c\ubcc4 \ucc9c\uccb4 \uc5ed\ud559 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uad6c\ubcc4\ub41c \uc784\ubb34 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ubcc4\ub3c4\uc758 \uc815\ucc45\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uc5ec \uc801\uc751\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud558\uace0 \uc6b4\uc601 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30\uc758 \uace0\uc720\ud55c \uc7a5\uc810\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uacbd\ub85c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \ub2e8\uc77c \uc815\ucc45 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub85c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30 \uae30\ubc18 RL \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadfc\uc811 \uc815\ucc45 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654(PPO)\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uc5ec, \uc6b0\ub9ac \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc21c\ud658 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc744 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30 \uc778\ucf54\ub354-\ub514\ucf54\ub354 \uad6c\uc870\ub85c \ub300\uccb4\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5 \ub3d9\uc548 \ucd08\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd84 \ub2e8\uc704\uc758 \uc784\ubb34 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uae30\uc5b5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

In autonomous driving, this is crucial to avoid collisions and navigate in complex, dense traffic scenarios. One way to plan is to search for the best action sequence. However, this is challenging when all necessary components - policy, next-state predictor, and critic - have to be learned. Here we propose Differentiable Simulation for Search (DSS), a framework that leverages the differentiable simulator Waymax as both a next state predictor and a critic. It relies on the simulator's hardcoded dynamics, making state predictions highly accurate, while utilizing the simulator's differentiability to effectively search across action sequences. Our DSS agent optimizes its actions using gradient descent over imagined future trajectories. We show experimentally that DSS - the combination of planning gradients and stochastic search - significantly improves tracking and path planning accuracy compared to sequence prediction, imitation learning, model-free RL, and other planning methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "DSS \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc790\uc728\uc8fc\ud589\uc5d0\uc11c \uc548\uc804\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc\ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \uc608\uce21\uacfc \ube44\ud310 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub41c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc790\uc728\uc8fc\ud589\uc5d0\uc11c \ucda9\ub3cc\uc744 \ud53c\ud558\uace0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uad50\ud1b5 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c \ub0b4\ube44\uac8c\uc774\uc158\uc744 \ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \ud589\ub3d9 \uacc4\ud68d\uc774 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "Differentiable Simulation for Search(DSS) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 Waymax \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc74c \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc608\uce21\uae30\uc640 \ube44\ud3c9\uac00\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub41c\ub2e4.", "result": "DSS\ub294 \ubbf8\ub798\uc758 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc0c1\uc0c1\ud558\uc5ec \uacbd\ub7c9\ud654\ub41c \ud589\ub3d9 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud558\uba70, \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \uacc4\ud68d \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud560 \ub54c \ucd94\uc801 \ubc0f \uacbd\ub85c \uacc4\ud68d\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b4\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "DSS\ub294 \uacc4\ud68d \uae30\uc6b8\uae30\uc640 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uac80\uc0c9\uc758 \uc870\ud569\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\uc804\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud560 \ub54c \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uacc4\ud68d\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc2e4\ud589\ud558\uae30 \uc804\uc5d0 \uc548\uc804\ud558\uac8c \ub2e4\ub4ec\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud574\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc790\uc728\uc8fc\ud589\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\uac83\uc740 \ucda9\ub3cc\uc744 \ud53c\ud558\uace0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud558\uace0 \ubc00\uc9d1\ub41c \uad50\ud1b5 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub97c \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacc4\ud68d\ud558\ub294 \ud55c \uac00\uc9c0 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\ub97c \ucc3e\ub294 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc815\ucc45, \ub2e4\uc74c \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc608\uce21\uae30 \ubc0f \ube44\ud3c9\uac00\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ud544\uc218 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ud574\uc57c \ud560 \ub54c \uc774\ub294 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5ec\uae30\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 Differentiable Simulation for Search(DSS)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\ub294\ub370, \uc774\ub294 \ucc28\uc138\ub300 \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc608\uce21\uae30\uc640 \ube44\ud3c9\uac00\ub85c\uc11c\uc758 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud558\ub294 \ucc28\ubcc4 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\ud130 Waymax\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ud558\ub4dc\ucf54\ub529\ub41c \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc608\uce21\uc744 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4e4\uba70, \ud589\ub3d9 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\uc0c9\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ubbf8\ubd84 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 DSS \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc0c1\uc0c1\ub41c \ubbf8\ub798 \uada4\uc801\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uacbd\ub7c9\ud654 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 DSS\uac00 \uacc4\ud68d \uae30\uc6b8\uae30\uc640 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uac80\uc0c9\uc758 \uc870\ud569\uc73c\ub85c, \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4 \uc608\uce21, \ubaa8\ubc29 \ud559\uc2b5, \ubaa8\ub378 \ud504\ub9ac \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc0f \uae30\ud0c0 \uacc4\ud68d \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec \ucd94\uc801 \ubc0f \uacbd\ub85c \uacc4\ud68d \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

As a result, there is a growing need to enhance the fairness of clustering outcomes, ideally by making minimal modifications, possibly as a post-processing step after conventional clustering. Recently, Chakraborty et al. [COLT'25] initiated the study of \\emph{closest fair clustering}, though in a restricted scenario where data points belong to only two groups. In practice, however, data points are typically characterized by many groups, reflecting diverse protected attributes such as age, ethnicity, gender, etc.\n  In this work, we generalize the study of the \\emph{closest fair clustering} problem to settings with an arbitrary number (more than two) of groups. We begin by showing that the problem is NP-hard even when all groups are of equal size -- a stark contrast with the two-group case, for which an exact algorithm exists. Next, we propose near-linear time approximation algorithms that efficiently handle arbitrary-sized multiple groups, thereby answering an open question posed by Chakraborty et al. [COLT'25].\n  Leveraging our closest fair clustering algorithms, we further achieve improved approximation guarantees for the \\emph{fair correlation clustering} problem, advancing the state-of-the-art results established by Ahmadian et al.

While ARC has inspired extensive research on abstract reasoning, most existing approaches rely on static input--output supervision, which limits insight into how reasoning unfolds over time. ARCTraj addresses this gap by recording temporally ordered, object-level actions that capture how humans iteratively transform inputs into outputs, revealing intermediate reasoning steps that conventional datasets overlook. Collected via the O2ARC web interface, it contains around 10,000 trajectories annotated with task identifiers, timestamps, and success labels across 400 training tasks from the ARC-AGI-1 benchmark. It further defines a unified reasoning pipeline encompassing data collection, action abstraction, Markov decision process (MDP) formulation, and downstream learning, enabling integration with reinforcement learning, generative modeling, and sequence modeling methods such as PPO, World Models, GFlowNets, Diffusion agents, and Decision Transformers. Analyses of spatial selection, color attribution, and strategic convergence highlight the structure and diversity of human reasoning. Together, these contributions position ARCTraj as a structured and interpretable foundation for studying human-like reasoning, advancing explainability, alignment, and generalizable intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "ARCTraj\ub294 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uacfc \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc801 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, ARC\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8ec\ub2e4.", "motivation": "ARC\ub294 \ucd94\uc0c1\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ucd09\ubc1c\ud588\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc785\ub825-\ucd9c\ub825 \uac10\ub3c5\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \ucd94\ub860 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c\ub2e4.", "method": "ARCTraj\ub294 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc21c\uc11c\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uae30\ub85d\ub41c \uac1d\uccb4 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc778\uac04\uc774 \uc785\ub825\uc744 \ucd9c\ub825\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub294 \uacfc\uc815\uc758 \uc911\uac04 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "O2ARC \uc6f9 \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc218\uc9d1\ub41c \uc57d 10,000\uac1c\uc758 \uada4\uc801\uc740 400\uac1c\uc758 \uacfc\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud0dc\uc2a4\ud06c \uc2dd\ubcc4\uc790, \ud0c0\uc784\uc2a4\ud0ec\ud504 \ubc0f \uc131\uacf5 \ub808\uc774\ube14\ub85c \uc8fc\uc11d\uc774 \ub2ec\ub824 \uc788\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "ARCTraj\ub294 \uc778\uac04\uacfc \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uc124\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131, \uc815\ub82c \ubc0f \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\uc804\uc2dc\ud0b4\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC)\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b \ubc0f \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc801 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 ARCTraj\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.

In this paper we show that such dynamics is related to a multiagent version of the Oja flow, a dynamical system that computes the principal eigenvector of a matrix corresponding for transformers to the value matrix. We classify the equilibria of the ``single-head'' self-attention system into four classes: consensus, bipartite consensus, clustering and polygonal equilibria. Multiple asymptotically stable equilibria from the first three classes often coexist in the self-attention dynamics. Interestingly, equilibria from the first two classes are always aligned with the eigenvectors of the value matrix, often but not exclusively with the principal eigenvector.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc140\ud504 \uc5b4\ud150\uc158 \uc5ed\ud559\uc774 \ud2b8\ub79c\uc2a4\ud3ec\uba38\uc758 \uc8fc\uc758 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5ec\ub7ec \uac00\uc9c0 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \ud3c9\ud615 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc758 \uc874\uc7ac\ub97c \ubd84\ub958\ud558\uace0, \uac12 \ud589\ub82c\uc758 \uace0\uc720 \ubca1\ud130\uc640\uc758 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ub17c\uc758\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud2b8\ub79c\uc2a4\ud3ec\uba38\uc758 \uc8fc\uc758 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc5f0\uad6c", "method": "\uc140\ud504 \uc5b4\ud150\uc158 \uc5ed\ud559\uacfc Oja \ud750\ub984\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubc84\uc804\uc744 \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\uc5ec \uade0\ud615 \uc0c1\ud0dc \ubd84\ub958", "result": "\uc140\ud504 \uc5b4\ud150\uc158 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc740 \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4\ub85c \ubd84\ub958\ub418\uba70, \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \ud3c9\ud615\uc774 \uacf5\uc874\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c.", "conclusion": "\uccab \ub450 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc740 \uac12 \ud589\ub82c\uc758 \uace0\uc720 \ubca1\ud130\uc5d0 \ud56d\uc0c1 \uc815\ub82c\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc74c.", "translated_summary": "\uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc140\ud504 \uc5b4\ud150\uc158 \uc5ed\ud559\uc740 \ud2b8\ub79c\uc2a4\ud3ec\uba38\uc758 \uc8fc\uc758 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc758 \uc5f0\uc18d \uc2dc\uac04 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc5ed\ud559\uc774 \ud2b8\ub79c\uc2a4\ud3ec\uba38\uc5d0 \ud574\ub2f9\ud558\ub294 \uac12 \ud589\ub82c\uc758 \uc8fc \uace0\uc720 \ubca1\ud130\ub97c \uacc4\uc0b0\ud558\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc778 Oja \ud750\ub984\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubc84\uc804\uacfc \uad00\ub828\uc774 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 '\ub2e8\uc77c \ud5e4\ub4dc' \uc140\ud504 \uc5b4\ud150\uc158 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4: \ud569\uc758, \uc774\ubd84 \ud569\uc758, \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130\ub9c1 \ubc0f \ub2e4\uac01\ud615 \ud3c9\ud615\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ub958\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uccab \uc138 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5ec\ub7ec \uac1c\uc758 \uc810\uadfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \ud3c9\ud615\uc774 \uc140\ud504 \uc5b4\ud150\uc158 \uc5ed\ud559\uc5d0\uc11c \uc885\uc885 \uacf5\uc874\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud765\ubbf8\ub86d\uac8c\ub3c4, \uccab \ub450 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4\uc758 \ud3c9\ud615\uc740 \ud56d\uc0c1 \uac12 \ud589\ub82c\uc758 \uace0\uc720 \ubca1\ud130\uc640 \uc815\ub82c\ub418\uba70, \uc885\uc885 \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uaf2d \uadf8\ub807\uc9c4 \uc54a\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc8fc \uace0\uc720 \ubca1\ud130\uc640\ub3c4 \uc815\ub82c\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Each scenario is encoded in a structured JSON schema that includes mission objectives, vehicle configuration, environmental conditions, and quantitative risk labels, providing a unified representation of UAV operations across diverse domains. Building on this foundation, we present UAVBench_MCQ, a reasoning-oriented extension containing 50,000 multiple-choice questions spanning ten cognitive and ethical reasoning styles, ranging from aerodynamics and navigation to multi-agent coordination and integrated reasoning. This framework enables interpretable and machine-checkable assessment of UAV-specific cognition under realistic operational contexts. We evaluate 32 state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-5, ChatGPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Flash, DeepSeek V3, Qwen3 235B, and ERNIE 4.5 300B, and find strong performance in perception and policy reasoning but persistent challenges in ethics-aware and resource-constrained decision-making. UAVBench establishes a reproducible and physically grounded foundation for benchmarking agentic AI in autonomous aerial systems and advancing next-generation UAV reasoning intelligence.

While systems that update and maintain a memory at inference time have been proposed, existing designs only steer the system by modifying textual input to a language model or agent, which means that they cannot change sampling parameters, remove tools, modify system prompts, or switch between agentic and workflow paradigms. On the other hand, systems that adapt more flexibly require offline optimization and remain static once deployed. We present Experience-Guided Reasoner (EGuR), which generates tailored strategies -- complete computational procedures involving LLM calls, tools, sampling parameters, and control logic -- dynamically at inference time based on accumulated experience. We achieve this using an LLM-based meta-strategy -- a strategy that outputs strategies -- enabling adaptation of all strategy components (prompts, sampling parameters, tool configurations, and control logic). EGuR operates through two components: a Guide generates multiple candidate strategies conditioned on the current problem and structured memory of past experiences, while a Consolidator integrates execution feedback to improve future strategy generation. This produces complete, ready-to-run strategies optimized for each problem, which can be cached, retrieved, and executed as needed without wasting resources.

There is a substantial risk that some of these decision induce harm to people, by infringing their well-being or their fundamental human rights. The state-of-the-art in AI systems makes little effort with respect to appropriate documentation of the decision process. This obstructs the ability to trace what went into a decision, which in turn is a prerequisite to any attempt of reconstructing a responsibility chain. Specifically, such traceability is linked to a documentation that will stand up in court when determining the cause of some AI-based decision that inadvertently or intentionally violates the law.\n  This paper takes a radical, yet practical, approach to this problem, by enforcing the documentation of each and every component that goes into the training or inference of an automated decision. As such, it presents the first running workflow supporting the generation of tamper-proof, verifiable and exhaustive traces of AI decisions. In doing so, we expand the DBOM concept into an effective running workflow leveraging confidential computing technology. We demonstrate the inner workings of the workflow in the development of an app to tell poisonous and edible mushrooms apart, meant as a playful example of high-stake decision support.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uacb0\uc815 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud22c\uba85\uc131\uc744 \ud655\ubcf4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815\uc758 \ubb38\uc11c\ud654\ub97c \uac15\uc81c\ud558\ub294 \uc791\ud488\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubd80\uc11c\uc9c4 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \uae30\uc220\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uace0\uc704\ud5d8 \uacb0\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud53c\ud574\ub97c \uc904\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud568\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uacb0\uc815\uc758 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub610\ub294 \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0 \ub4e4\uc5b4\uac00\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\uc758 \ubb38\uc11c\ud654\ub97c \uac15\uc81c\ud558\ub294 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\ubcc0\uc870\uac00 \ubd88\uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c AI \uacb0\uc815\uc758 \ucca0\uc800\ud55c \ucd94\uc801\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub294 \ube44\ubc00 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305 \uae30\uc220\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec DBOM \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc790\ub3d9\ud654 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ube44\ub6a4\uc5b4\uc9c4 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \uae30\uc220\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc740 \uace0\uc704\ud5d8 \uacb0\uc815\uc774 \ub0b4\ub824\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacb0\uc815 \uc911 \uc77c\ubd80\ub294 \uc0ac\ub78c\uc758 \ubcf5\uc9c0\ub098 \uae30\ubcf8 \uc778\uad8c\uc744 \uce68\ud574\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ud53c\ud574\ub97c \uc720\ubc1c\ud560 \uc704\ud5d8\uc774 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud558\ub2e4.

Fundamentally, aligning LVLMs is not just a safety challenge but a problem of economic efficiency. Current alignment methods struggle with the trade-off between safety, utility, and operational costs. Critically, a focus solely on final outputs (process-blindness) wastes significant computational budget on unsafe deliberation. This flaw allows harmful reasoning to be disguised with benign justifications, thereby circumventing simple additive safety scores. To address this, we propose EcoAlign, an inference-time framework that reframes alignment as an economically rational search by treating the LVLM as a boundedly rational agent. EcoAlign incrementally expands a thought graph and scores actions using a forward-looking function (analogous to net present value) that dynamically weighs expected safety, utility, and cost against the remaining budget. To prevent deception, path safety is enforced via the weakest-link principle. Extensive experiments across 3 closed-source and 2 open-source models on 6 datasets show that EcoAlign matches or surpasses state-of-the-art safety and utility at a lower computational cost, thereby offering a principled, economical pathway to robust LVLM alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "EcoAlign\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 LVLM\uc758 \uc815\ub82c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uacbd\uc81c\uc801 \ube44\uc728\ub85c \uc811\uadfc\ud558\uc5ec \uc548\uc804\uc131\uacfc \ud6a8\uc6a9\uc744 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uc6b4\uc601 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uc904\uc778\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LVLM\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud558\uba70, \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uacbd\uc81c\uc801 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \uc811\uadfc\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \ub3d9\uae30\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "EcoAlign\uc740 LVLM\uc744 \uc81c\uc57d\ub41c \ud569\ub9ac\uc801 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \ubcf4\uace0 \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \uacbd\uc81c\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud569\ub9ac\uc801\uc778 \uac80\uc0c9 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc0ac\uace0 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \uc810\uc9c4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uace0, \ube44\uc728\uc801 \ubbf8\ub798 \uac00\uce58\uc640 \ube44\uc2b7\ud55c \ud568\uc218\ub85c \uc548\uc804\uc131, \ud6a8\uc6a9 \ubc0f \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc5ec \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc810\uc218\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "3\uac1c\uc758 \ud3d0\uc1c4\ud615 \uc18c\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc 2\uac1c\uc758 \uac1c\ubc29\ud615 \uc18c\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c 6\uac1c\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uc218\ud589\ub41c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, EcoAlign\uc740 \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uacfc \ud6a8\uc6a9 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uac70\ub098 \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ub354 \ub0ae\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \ub3d9\uc791\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "EcoAlign\uc740 LVLM \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud558\uace0 \uacbd\uc81c\uc801\uc778 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ube44\uc804-\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LVLM)\uc740 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud0c8\uc625 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc5d0 \uc2dc\ub2ec\ub9b0\ub2e4. \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c LVLM\uc744 \uc815\ub82c\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \uc548\uc804 \ubb38\uc81c\ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uacbd\uc81c\uc801 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\uc774\ub2e4. \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uc815\ub82c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc548\uc804\uc131, \uc720\uc6a9\uc131 \ubc0f \uc6b4\uc601 \ube44\uc6a9 \uac04\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uc885 \uacb0\uacfc\uc5d0\ub9cc \uc9d1\uc911\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774(\uacfc\uc815 \ub9f9\ubaa9\uc131) \uc548\uc804\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uc2ec\uc758\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc608\uc0b0\uc744 \ub0ad\ube44\ud558\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4e0\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacb0\ud568\uc740 \ud574\ub85c\uc6b4 \ucd94\ub860\uc774 \ubb34\ud574\ud55c \uc815\ub2f9\ud654\ub85c \uc704\uc7a5\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \ucd94\uac00 \uc548\uc804 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \ud68c\ud53c\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 EcoAlign\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 LVLM\uc744 \uc81c\uc57d\ub41c \ud569\ub9ac\uc801 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \ucde8\uae09\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \uacbd\uc81c\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud569\ub9ac\uc801\uc778 \uac80\uc0c9\uc73c\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc\uac04 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.

While rule-based approaches offer interpretability through predefined psychological principles, they often lack generalizability and flexibility. Conversely, data-driven methods can learn complex behaviors from large-scale datasets, but are typically inefficient, opaque, and difficult to align with human intuitions. To bridge this gap, we propose RLSLM, a hybrid Reinforcement Learning framework that integrates a rule-based Social Locomotion Model, grounded in empirical behavioral experiments, into the reward function of a reinforcement learning framework. The social locomotion model generates an orientation-sensitive social comfort field that quantifies human comfort across space, enabling socially aligned navigation policies with minimal training. RLSLM then jointly optimizes mechanical energy and social comfort, allowing agents to avoid intrusions into personal or group space. A human-agent interaction experiment using an immersive VR-based setup demonstrates that RLSLM outperforms state-of-the-art rule-based models in user experience. Ablation and sensitivity analyses further show the model's significantly improved interpretability over conventional data-driven methods.

To address this, we propose MarsRL, a novel reinforcement learning framework with agentic pipeline parallelism, designed to jointly optimize all agents in the system. MarsRL introduces agent-specific reward mechanisms to mitigate reward noise and employs pipeline-inspired training to enhance efficiency in handling long trajectories. Applied to Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507, MarsRL improves AIME2025 accuracy from 86.5% to 93.3% and BeyondAIME from 64.9% to 73.8%, even surpassing Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507. These findings highlight the potential of MarsRL to advance multi-agent reasoning systems and broaden their applicability across diverse reasoning tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "MarsRL\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ubcc4 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uacfc \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc73c\ub85c \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc740 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uae34 \uacbd\ub85c \ucc98\ub9ac\ub97c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac1c\uc120\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ucd5c\uadfc \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RLVR)\uacfc \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud0c0\uc784 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ucd09\uc9c4\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 LLM\uc758 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ucd9c\ub825 \uae38\uc774\ub294 \ub2e8\uc77c \ucd94\ub860 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2ec\uc131 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ucd94\ub860\uc758 \uae4a\uc774\ub97c \uc81c\ud55c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "MarsRL\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \ubcd1\ub82c\uc131\uc744 \uac16\ucd98 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ub0b4 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uacf5\ub3d9 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, most existing approaches assume that communication is instantaneous, reliable, and has unlimited bandwidth; these conditions are rarely met in real-world deployments. This survey systematically reviews recent advances in robust and efficient communication strategies for MARL under realistic constraints, including message perturbations, transmission delays, and limited bandwidth. Furthermore, because the challenges of low-latency reliability, bandwidth-intensive data sharing, and communication-privacy trade-offs are central to practical MARL systems, we focus on three applications involving cooperative autonomous driving, distributed simultaneous localization and mapping, and federated learning.

Agents trained solely to achieve their objectives may adopt harmful behavior, exposing a key trade-off between maximizing the reward function and maintaining the alignment. For the pre-trained agents, ensuring alignment is particularly challenging, as retraining can be a costly and slow process. This is further complicated by the diverse and potentially conflicting attributes representing the ethical values for alignment. To address these challenges, we propose a test-time alignment technique based on model-guided policy shaping. Our method allows precise control over individual behavioral attributes, generalizes across diverse reinforcement learning (RL) environments, and facilitates a principled trade-off between ethical alignment and reward maximization without requiring agent retraining. We evaluate our approach using the MACHIAVELLI benchmark, which comprises 134 text-based game environments and thousands of annotated scenarios involving ethical decisions. The RL agents are first trained to maximize the reward in their respective games. At test time, we apply policy shaping via scenario-action attribute classifiers to ensure decision alignment with ethical attributes. We compare our approach against prior training-time methods and general-purpose agents, as well as study several types of ethical violations and power-seeking behavior. Our results demonstrate that test-time policy shaping provides an effective and scalable solution for mitigating unethical behavior across diverse environments and alignment attributes.", "AI":
