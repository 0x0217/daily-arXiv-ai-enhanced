We introduce an evaluation framework where LLMs generate strategies encoded as algorithms, enabling inspection prior to deployment and scaling to populations of hundreds of agents -- substantially larger than in previous work. We find that more recent models tend to produce worse societal outcomes compared to older models when agents prioritise individual gain over collective benefits. Using cultural evolution to model user selection of agents, our simulations reveal a significant risk of convergence to poor societal equilibria, particularly when the relative benefit of cooperation diminishes and population sizes increase.

Submitted to the 48th Rocky Mountain American Astronautical Society's Guidance, Navigation and Control Conference", "summary": "In order for close proximity satellites to safely perform their missions, the relative states of all satellites and pieces of debris must be well understood. This presents a problem for ground based tracking and orbit determination since it may not be practical to achieve the required accuracy. Using space-based sensors allows for more accurate relative state estimates, especially if multiple satellites are allowed to communicate. Of interest to this work is the case where several communicating satellites each need to maintain a local catalog of communicating and non-communicating objects using angles-only limited field of view (FOV) measurements. However, this introduces the problem of efficiently scheduling and coordinating observations among the agents. This paper presents a decentralized task allocation algorithm to address this problem and quantifies its performance in terms of fuel usage and overall catalog uncertainty via numerical simulation.

This ecosystem is characterized by short-term, often one-off, transactions between parties that have no prior familiarity. To establish trust among users, platforms employ rating systems which allow users to report on the quality of their previous interactions. However, while arguably crucial for these platforms to function, rating systems can perpetuate negative biases against marginalised groups. This paper investigates how to design platforms around biased reputation systems, reducing discrimination while maintaining incentives for all service providers to offer high quality service for users. We introduce an evolutionary game theoretical model to study how digital platforms can perpetuate or counteract rating-based discrimination. We focus on the platforms' decisions to promote service providers who have high reputations or who belong to a specific protected group. Our results demonstrate a fundamental trade-off between user experience and fairness: promoting highly-rated providers benefits users, but lowers the demand for marginalised providers against which the ratings are biased. Our results also provide evidence that intervening by tuning the demographics of the search results is a highly effective way of reducing unfairness while minimally impacting users. Furthermore, we show that even when precise measurements on the level of rating bias affecting marginalised service providers is unavailable, there is still potential to improve upon a recommender system which ignores protected characteristics. Altogether, our model highlights the benefits of proactive anti-discrimination design in systems where ratings are used to promote cooperative behaviour.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub514\uc9c0\ud138

We investigate optimization instability, a phenomenon in which continued autonomous improvement paradoxically degrades classifier performance, using Pythia, an open-source framework for automated prompt optimization. Evaluating three clinical symptoms with varying prevalence (shortness of breath at 23%, chest pain at 12%, and Long COVID brain fog at 3%), we observed that validation sensitivity oscillated between 1.0 and 0.0 across iterations, with severity inversely proportional to class prevalence. At 3% prevalence, the system achieved 95% accuracy while detecting zero positive cases, a failure mode obscured by standard evaluation metrics. We evaluated two interventions: a guiding agent that actively redirected optimization, amplifying overfitting rather than correcting it, and a selector agent that retrospectively identified the best-performing iteration successfully prevented catastrophic failure. With selector agent oversight, the system outperformed expert-curated lexicons on brain fog detection by 331% (F1) and chest pain by 7%, despite requiring only a single natural language term as input. These findings characterize a critical failure mode of autonomous AI systems and demonstrate that retrospective selection outperforms active intervention for stabilization in low-prevalence

Gandhi", "Idan Habler", "Yuval Elovici", "Asaf Shabtai"], "title": "From Tool Orchestration to Code Execution: A Study of MCP Design Choices", "comment": null, "summary": "Model Context Protocols (MCPs) provide a unified platform for agent systems to discover, select, and orchestrate tools across heterogeneous execution environments. As MCP-based systems scale to incorporate larger tool catalogs and multiple concurrently connected MCP servers, traditional tool-by-tool invocation increases coordination overhead, fragments state management, and limits support for wide-context operations. To address these scalability challenges, recent MCP designs have incorporated code execution as a first-class capability, an approach called Code Execution MCP (CE-MCP). This enables agents to consolidate complex workflows, such as SQL querying, file analysis, and multi-step data transformations, into a single program that executes within an isolated runtime environment. In this work, we formalize the architectural distinction between context-coupled (traditional) and context-decoupled (CE-MCP) models, analyzing their fundamental scalability trade-offs. Using the MCP-Bench framework across 10 representative servers, we empirically evaluate task behavior, tool utilization patterns, execution latency, and protocol efficiency as the scale of connected MCP servers and available tools increases, demonstrating that while CE-MCP significantly reduces token usage and execution latency, it introduces a vastly expanded attack surface. We address this security gap by applying the MAESTRO framework, identifying sixteen attack classes across five execution phases-including specific code execution threats such as exception-mediated code injection and unsafe capability synthesis. We validate these vulnerabilities through adversarial scenarios across multiple LLMs and propose a layered defense architecture comprising containerized sandboxing and semantic gating. Our findings provide a rigorous roadmap for balancing scalability and security in production-ready executable agent workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "MCP\ub294 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc2e4\ud589 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uace0 \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\uba70 \uc870\uc815\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub3c4\uad6c \ud638\ucd9c \uc99d\uac00\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uc870\uc815 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc \ubc0f \uc0c1\ud0dc \uad00\ub9ac \ub2e8\ud3b8\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud55c\ub2e4.

As a consequence, they tend to generate samples from only a narrow portion of the feasible domain. This is a fundamental limitation for scientific discovery applications, where one typically aims to sample valid designs beyond the available data distribution. To this end, we address the challenge of leveraging access to a verifier (e.g., an atomic bonds checker), to adapt a pre-trained flow model so that its induced density expands beyond regions of high data availability, while preserving samples validity. We introduce formal notions of strong and weak verifiers and propose algorithmic frameworks for global and local flow expansion via probability-space optimization. Then, we present Flow Expander (FE), a scalable mirror descent scheme that provably tackles both problems by verifier-constrained entropy maximization over the flow process noised state space. Next, we provide a thorough theoretical analysis of the proposed method, and state convergence guarantees under both idealized and general assumptions. Ultimately, we empirically evaluate our method on both illustrative, yet visually interpretable settings, and on a molecular design task showcasing the ability of FE to expand a pre-trained flow model increasing conformer diversity while preserving validity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ud750\ub984 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ub370\uc774\ud130

Mean-field methods alleviate this burden by aggregating agent interactions, but these approaches assume homogeneous interactions. Recent graphon-based frameworks capture heterogeneity, but are computationally expensive as the number of agents grows. Therefore, we introduce $\\texttt{GMFS}$, a $\\textbf{G}$raphon $\\textbf{M}$ean-$\\textbf{F}$ield $\\textbf{S}$ubsampling framework for scalable cooperative MARL with heterogeneous agent interactions. By subsampling $\u03ba$ agents according to interaction strength, we approximate the graphon-weighted mean-field and learn a policy with sample complexity $\\mathrm{poly}(\u03ba)$ and optimality gap $O(1/\\sqrt\u03ba)$. We verify our theory with numerical simulations in robotic coordination, showing that $\\texttt{GMFS}$ achieves near-optimal performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud611\ub825\uc801 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uadf8\ub798\ud3f0 \ud3c9\uade0\uc7a5 \ud558\uc704 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 GMFS\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(MARL)\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub85c, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc218\uac00 \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c Joint State-Action Space\uc758 \ud06c\uae30\uac00 \uae30\ud558\uae09\uc218\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc99d\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uac15\ub3c4\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \u03ba\uac1c\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud558\uc704 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\ud558\uc5ec \uadf8\ub798\ud3f0 \uac00\uc911 \ud3c9\uade0\uc7a5\uc744 \uadfc\uc0ac\ud558\uace0, \ud45c\ubcf8 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc740 poly(\u03ba)\uc774\uace0 \ucd5c\uc801\uc131 \uac04\uaca9\uc740 O(1/\u221a\u03ba)\uc778 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub85c\ubd07 \uc870\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc218\uce58 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\ub860\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uba70, GMFS\uac00 \uac70\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "GMFS\ub294 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud55c \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud611\ub825\uc801 MARL\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(MARL)\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc559 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c, \uacf5\ud1b5 \uc0c1\ud0dc-\ud589\ub3d9 \uacf5\uac04\uc758 \ud06c\uae30\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc218\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uae30\ud558\uae09\uc218\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\ub300\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud3c9\uade0\uc7a5 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uc9d1\uacc4\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubd80\ub2f4\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ub3d9\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uac00\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc \uadf8\ub798\ud3f0 \uae30\ubc18 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc218\uac00 \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud611\ub825\uc801 MARL\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uadf8\ub798\ud3f0 \ud3c9\uade0\uc7a5 \ud558\uc704 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 GMFS\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uac15\ub3c4\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \u03ba\uac1c\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud558\uc704 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\ud558\uc5ec \uadf8\ub798\ud3f0 \uac00\uc911 \ud3c9\uade0\uc7a5\uc744 \uadfc\uc0ac\ud558\uace0, \ud45c\ubcf8 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc740 poly(\u03ba)\uc774\uace0 \ucd5c\uc801\uc131 \uac04\uaca9\uc740 O(1/\u221a\u03ba)\uc778 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub85c\ubd07 \uc870\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc218\uce58 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\ub860\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uba70, GMFS\uac00 \uac70\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Existing approaches face fundamental limitations: they cannot effectively share intelligence across borders due to privacy constraints, lack reasoning capabilities to understand complex multi-step attack patterns, and fail to capture intricate graph-structured relationships in financial networks. We introduce FedGraph-AGI, a novel federated learning framework integrating Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) reasoning with graph neural networks for privacy-preserving cross-border insider threat detection. Our approach combines: (1) federated graph neural networks preserving data sovereignty; (2) Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) aggregation for heterogeneous jurisdictions; and (3) AGI-powered reasoning via Large Action Models (LAM) performing causal inference over graph data. Through experiments on a 50,000-transaction dataset across 10 jurisdictions, FedGraph-AGI achieves 92.3% accuracy, significantly outperforming federated baselines (86.1%) and centralized approaches (84.7%). Our ablation studies reveal AGI reasoning contributes 6.8% improvement, while MoE adds 4.4%.

Prior approaches typically rely on static datasets, either training implicit preference models on interaction history or encoding user profiles in external memory. However, these approaches struggle with new users and with preferences that change over time. We introduce Personalized Agents from Human Feedback (PAHF), a framework for continual personalization in which agents learn online from live interaction using explicit per-user memory. PAHF operationalizes a three-step loop: (1) seeking pre-action clarification to resolve ambiguity, (2) grounding actions in preferences retrieved from memory, and (3) integrating post-action feedback to update memory when preferences drift. To evaluate this capability, we develop a four-phase protocol and two benchmarks in embodied manipulation and online shopping. These benchmarks quantify an agent's ability to learn initial preferences from scratch and subsequently adapt to persona shifts.

Our proposed approach relies on the extraction of a specifically curated and explicit set of topological, geometric and directional features, designed to satisfy key invariance properties. We leverage the resulting feature representation for tasks such as group comparison, clustering and classification on cohorts of shape graphs.

Natural language is interpretable but vulnerable to semantic drift, while learned protocols are efficient but opaque. We propose a certification protocol based on the stimulus-meaning model, where agents are tested on shared observable events and terms are certified if empirical disagreement falls below a statistical threshold. In this protocol, agents restricting their reasoning to certified terms (\"core-guarded reasoning\") achieve provably bounded disagreement.

Appendix: an additional 5 pages", "summary": "Jailbreak prompts are a practical and evolving threat to large language models (LLMs), particularly in agentic systems that execute tools over untrusted content. Many attacks exploit long-context hiding, semantic camouflage, and lightweight obfuscations that can evade single-pass guardrails. We present RLM-JB, an end-to-end jailbreak detection framework built on Recursive Language Models (RLMs), in which a root model orchestrates a bounded analysis program that transforms the input, queries worker models over covered segments, and aggregates evidence into an auditable decision. RLM-JB treats detection as a procedure rather than a one-shot classification: it normalizes and de-obfuscates suspicious inputs, chunks text to reduce context dilution and guarantee coverage, performs parallel chunk screening, and composes cross-chunk signals to recover split-payload attacks. On AutoDAN-style adversarial inputs, RLM-JB achieves high detection effectiveness across three LLM backends (ASR/Recall 92.5-98.0%) while maintaining very high precision (98.99-100%) and low false positive rates (0.0-2.0%), highlighting a practical sensitivity-specificity trade-off as the screening backend changes.", "AI": {"tldr": "RLM-JB\ub294 \uc7ac\uadc0 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uc5ec \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 Jailbreak \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uc5ec\ub7ec LLM \ubc31\uc5d4\ub4dc\uc5d0\uc11c \ub192\uc740 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc815\ubc00\ub3c4\uc640 \ub0ae\uc740 \uc704\uc591\uc131\ub960\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c jailbreak \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\uc758 \uc704\ud611\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ud2b9\ud788 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \ucf58\ud150\uce20\uc5d0\uc11c \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uc2e4\ud589\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "RLM-JB\ub294 \uc785\ub825\uc744 \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\uace0, \uc228\uaca8\uc9c4 \ubd80\ubd84\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc791\uc5c5\uc790 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ucffc\ub9ac\ud558\uba70, \uac80\ud1a0 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc99d\uac70\ub97c \uc9d1\uacc4\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uacc4 \ubd84\uc11d \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ub8e8\ud2b8 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uac16\ucd98 \uc7ac\uadc0 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc5d4\ub4dc \ud22c \uc5d4\ub4dc jailbreak \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc758\uc2ec\uc2a4\ub7ec\uc6b4 \uc785\ub825\uc744 \uc815\uc0c1\ud654\ud558\uace0 \ub514\uc624\ube0c\ud478\uc2a4\ucf00\uc774\uc158\ud558\uba70, \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \ubd84\ud560\ud558\uace0 \ubcd1\ub82c \uccad\ud06c \uc2a4\ud06c\ub9ac\ub2dd\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ub4f1\uc758 \uc808\ucc28\uc801 \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub97c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "RLM-JB\ub294 AutoDAN \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c\uc758 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc785\ub825\uc5d0\uc11c \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 LLM \ubc31\uc5d4\ub4dc\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \ub192\uc740 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131(ASR/\uc7ac\ud604\uc728 92.5-98.0%)\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0, \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ub192\uc740 \uc815\ubc00\ub3c4(98.99-100%)\uc640 \ub0ae\uc740 \uc704\uc591\uc131\ub960(0.0-2.0%)\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc2a4\ud06c\ub9ac\ub2dd \ubc31\uc5d4\ub4dc\uac00 \ubcc0\uacbd\ub428\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \ubbfc\uac10\ub3c4-\ud2b9\uc774\uc131 \ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ub4dc\uc624\ud504\ub97c \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "Jailbreak \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub294 \ud2b9\uc774\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \ucf58\ud150\uce20\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uc2e4\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\uc81c\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc9c4\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc704\ud611\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9ce\uc740 \uacf5\uaca9\uc740 \ub2e8\uc77c \ud328\uc2a4 \uac00\ub4dc\ub808\uc77c\uc744 \ud53c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uae34 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc228\uae40, \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc801 \uce74\ubb34\ud50c\ub77c\uc8fc \ubc0f \uacbd\ub7c9\uc758 \uc624\ube0c\uc2a4\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc785\ub825\uc744 \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\uace0, \uc228\uaca8\uc9c4 \ubd80\ubd84\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc791\uc5c5\uc790 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ucffc\ub9ac\ud558\uba70, \uac80\ud1a0 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc99d\uac70\ub97c \uc9d1\uacc4\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uacc4 \ubd84\uc11d \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ub8e8\ud2b8 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uac16\ucd98 \uc7ac\uadc0 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(RLM)\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uc5d4\ub4dc \ud22c \uc5d4\ub4dc jailbreak \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c RLM-JB\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Frontier models such as GPT-5.2 and Claude Opus 4.6 solve fewer than 30\\% of tasks when all expert-authored rubric criteria must be satisfied. Using this environment, we train GLM~4.6 with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and adaptive clipping. After a single epoch of training, the model improves from 25.37\\% to 36.76\\% task pass rate on held-out evaluation tasks. More importantly, these gains transfer to out-of-distribution benchmarks: +4.5\\% on BFCL Parallel, +7.4\\% on $\u03c4^2$-Bench Retail, and +6.8\\% on Toolathlon (Pass@1). We believe three environment properties are consistent with the observed transfer: task-centric world building that optimizes for diverse, challenging tasks; expert-authored rubrics enabling reliable reward computation; and enterprise workflows that reflect realistic professional patterns.

Most existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches model LLM agents as flat policies operating at a single time scale, selecting one action at each turn. In sparse-reward settings, such flat policies must propagate credit across the entire trajectory without explicit temporal abstraction, which often leads to unstable optimization and inefficient credit assignment.\n  We propose HiPER, a novel Hierarchical Plan-Execute RL framework that explicitly separates high-level planning from low-level execution. HiPER factorizes the policy into a high-level planner that proposes subgoals and a low-level executor that carries them out over multiple action steps. To align optimization with this structure, we introduce a key technique called hierarchical advantage estimation (HAE), which carefully assigns credit at both the planning and execution levels. By aggregating returns over the execution of each subgoal and coordinating updates across the two levels, HAE provides an unbiased gradient estimator and provably reduces variance compared to flat generalized advantage estimation.\n  Empirically, HiPER achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging interactive benchmarks, reaching 97.4\\% success on ALFWorld and 83.3\\% on WebShop with Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct (+6.6\\% and +8.3\\% over the best prior method), with especially large gains on long-horizon tasks requiring multiple dependent subtasks.

However, existing AFE methods rely on statistical heuristics, yielding brittle features that fail under distribution shift. We introduce CAFE, a framework that reformulates AFE as a causally-guided sequential decision process, bridging causal discovery with reinforcement learning-driven feature construction. Phase I learns a sparse directed acyclic graph over features and the target to obtain soft causal priors, grouping features as direct, indirect, or other based on their causal influence with respect to the target. Phase II uses a cascading multi-agent deep Q-learning architecture to select causal groups and transformation operators, with hierarchical reward shaping and causal group-level exploration strategies that favor causally plausible transformations while controlling feature complexity. Across 15 public benchmarks (classification with macro-F1; regression with inverse relative absolute error), CAFE achieves up to 7% improvement over strong AFE baselines, reduces episodes-to-convergence, and delivers competitive time-to-target. Under controlled covariate shifts, CAFE reduces performance drop by ~4x relative to a non-causal multi-agent baseline, and produces more compact feature sets with more stable post-hoc attributions. These findings underscore that causal structure, used as a soft inductive prior rather than a rigid constraint, can substantially improve the robustness and efficiency of automated feature engineering.", "AI": {"tldr": "CAF\u00c9\ub77c\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 \uc81c\uc548\ub418\uc5b4 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ud2b9\uc131 \uacf5\ud559(AFE)\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4

Embedding these policies in prompts provides no enforcement guarantees. We present PCAS, a Policy Compiler for Agentic Systems that provides deterministic policy enforcement.\n  Enforcing such policies requires tracking information flow across agents, which linear message histories cannot capture. Instead, PCAS models the agentic system state as a dependency graph capturing causal relationships among events such as tool calls, tool results, and messages. Policies are expressed in a Datalog-derived language, as declarative rules that account for transitive information flow and cross-agent provenance. A reference monitor intercepts all actions and blocks violations before execution, providing deterministic enforcement independent of model reasoning.\n  PCAS takes an existing agent implementation and a policy specification, and compiles them into an instrumented system that is policy-compliant by construction, with no security-specific restructuring required. We evaluate PCAS on three case studies: information flow policies for prompt injection defense, approval workflows in a multi-agent pharmacovigilance system, and organizational policies for customer service. On customer service tasks, PCAS improves policy compliance from 48% to 93% across frontier models, with zero policy violations in instrumented runs.", "AI": {"tldr": "PCAS\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc815\ucc45 \ucef4\ud30c\uc77c\ub7ec\ub85c, \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc2b9\uc778 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uacb0\uc815\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2dc\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uace0\uac1d \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c, \uc2b9\uc778 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud750\ub984, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc811\uadfc \uc81c\ud55c \ubc0f \uaddc\uc81c \uc900\uc218\uc640 \uac19\uc774 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc2b9\uc778 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0\uc11c \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ubc30\ud3ec\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "PCAS\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \uc758\uc874\uc131 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uace0, \uc815\ucc45\uc744 Datalog \ud30c\uc0dd \uc5b8\uc5b4\ub85c \uc120\uc5b8\uc801 \uaddc\uce59\uc73c\ub85c \ud45c\ud604\ud558\uc5ec \ube44\uacb0\uc815\ub860\uc801 \uc774\uc720\uc640 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2e4\ud589 \uc774\uc804\uc5d0 \uc704\ubc18\uc744 \ucc28\ub2e8\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "PCAS\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc0ac\ub840 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uace0\uac1d \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ucc45 \uc900\uc218\ub97c 48%\uc5d0\uc11c 93%\ub85c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf30\uace0, \ub3c4\uad6c\ud654\ub41c \uc2e4\ud589\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc815\ucc45 \uc704\ubc18\uc774 \uc5c6\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "PCAS\ub294 \uc815\ucc45 \uc900\uc218\ub97c \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uba70, \uae30\uc874 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uad6c\ud604 \ubc0f \uc815\ucc45 \uc0ac\uc591\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc870\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\ucc45 \uc900\uc218 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uace0\uac1d \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c, \uc2b9\uc778 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud750\ub984, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc811\uadfc \uc81c\ud55c \ubc0f \uaddc\uc81c \uc900\uc218\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc2b9\uc778 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0\uc11c \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ubc30\ud3ec\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \ud574\uc11c \uc2e4\ud589 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc774 \uc81c\uacf5\ub418\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc544\ub2d9\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uacb0\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc815\ucc45 \uc9d1\ud589\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc815\ucc45 \ucef4\ud30c\uc77c\ub7ec\uc778 PCAS\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ud55c \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc9d1\ud589\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04 \uc815\ubcf4 \ud750\ub984\uc744 \ucd94\uc801\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\ub294\ub370, \uc774\ub294 \uc120\ud615 \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0 \uae30\ub85d\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub300\uc2e0, PCAS\ub294 \ub3c4\uad6c \ud638\ucd9c, \ub3c4\uad6c \uacb0\uacfc \ubc0f \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc0ac\uac74 \uac04\uc758 \uc778\uacfc \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \uc758\uc874\uc131 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub85c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc815\ucc45\uc740 \uc804\uc774 \uc815\ubcf4 \ud750\ub984 \ubc0f \uad50\ucc28 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ucd9c\ucc98\ub97c \uace0\ub824\ud55c \uc120\uc5b8\uc801 \uaddc\uce59\uc73c\ub85c Datalog \ud30c\uc0dd \uc5b8\uc5b4\ub85c \ud45c\ud604\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucc38\uc870 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uac00\ub85c\ucc44\uace0 \uc2e4\ud589 \uc804\uc5d0 \uc704\ubc18\uc744 \ucc28\ub2e8\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378 \ucd94\ub860\uacfc \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \uacb0\uc815\ub860\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\ud589\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Rather than proposing novel methods, we focus on several alternative approaches whose potential benefits are widely imaginable, yet have remained largely unexplored. The currently dominant paradigm, which can be termed \"extract then store,\" involves extracting information judged to be useful from experiences and saving only the extracted content. However, this approach inherently risks the loss of information, as some valuable knowledge particularly for different tasks may be discarded in the extraction process. In contrast, we emphasize the \"store then on-demand extract\" approach, which seeks to retain raw experiences and flexibly apply them to various tasks as needed, thus avoiding such information loss. In addition, we highlight two further approaches: discovering deeper insights from large collections of probabilistic experiences, and improving experience collection efficiency by sharing stored experiences. While these approaches seem intuitively effective, our simple experiments demonstrate that this is indeed the case.

MetaDOAR learns a compact state projection from per node structural embeddings to rapidly score and select a small subset of devices (a top-k partition) on which a conventional low-level actor performs focused beam search utilizing a critic agent. Selected candidate actions are evaluated with batched critic forwards and stored in an LRU cache keyed by a quantized state projection and local action identifiers, dramatically reducing redundant critic computation while preserving decision quality via conservative k-hop cache invalidation. Empirically, MetaDOAR attains higher player payoffs than SOTA baselines on large network topologies, without significant scaling issues in terms of memory usage or training time.

Benchmarks for these agents must both reliably compare models and yield on-policy training data. Prior agentic benchmarks (e.g., tau-bench, tau2-bench, AppWorld) rely on fully deterministic backends, which are costly to build and iterate. We propose Proxy State-Based Evaluation, an LLM-driven simulation framework that preserves final state-based evaluation without a deterministic database. Specifically, a scenario specifies the user goal, user/system facts, expected final state, and expected agent behavior, and an LLM state tracker infers a structured proxy state from the full interaction trace. LLM judges then verify goal completion and detect tool/user hallucinations against scenario constraints. Empirically, our benchmark produces stable, model-differentiating rankings across families and inference-time reasoning efforts, and its on-/off-policy rollouts provide supervision that transfers to unseen scenarios. Careful scenario specification yields near-zero simulator hallucination rates as supported by ablation studies. The framework also supports sensitivity analyses over user personas.

Recent work showed that mutual cooperation can be induced between \"learning-aware\" agents that account for and shape the learning dynamics of their co-players. However, existing approaches typically rely on hardcoded, often inconsistent, assumptions about co-player learning rules or enforce a strict separation between \"naive learners\" updating on fast timescales and \"meta-learners\" observing these updates. Here, we demonstrate that the in-context learning capabilities of sequence models allow for co-player learning awareness without requiring hardcoded assumptions or explicit timescale separation. We show that training sequence model agents against a diverse distribution of co-players naturally induces in-context best-response strategies, effectively functioning as learning algorithms on the fast intra-episode timescale. We find that the cooperative mechanism identified in prior work-where vulnerability to extortion drives mutual shaping-emerges naturally in this setting: in-context adaptation renders agents vulnerable to extortion, and the resulting mutual pressure to shape the opponent's in-context learning dynamics resolves into the learning of cooperative behavior. Our results suggest that standard decentralized reinforcement learning on sequence models combined with co-player diversity provides a scalable path to learning cooperative behaviors.", "AI": {"tldr":

Reward-free exploration aims to enable $\u03b5$-optimal policies for any reward revealed after exploration, while reward-agnostic exploration targets $\u03b5$-optimality for rewards drawn from a small finite class. In the reward-agnostic setting, Li, Yan, Chen, and Fan achieve minimax sample complexity, but only for restrictively small accuracy parameter $\u03b5$. We propose a new algorithm that significantly relaxes the requirement on $\u03b5$. Our approach is novel and of technical interest by itself. Our algorithm employs an online learning procedure with carefully designed rewards to construct an exploration policy, which is used to gather data sufficient for accurate dynamics estimation and subsequent computation of an $\u03b5$-optimal policy once the reward is revealed. Finally, we establish a tight lower bound for reward-free exploration, closing the gap between known upper and lower bounds.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc5d0\ud53c\uc18c\ub4dc \uc720\ud55c \uc9c0\ud3c9\uc120 \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815(MDP)\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc5c6\ub294 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uacfc \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubb34\uad00 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc678\ubd80 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \uad00\ucc30\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0\ub3c4 \uc54c\ub824\uc9c0\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \ub3d9\uae30\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \uc2e0\uc911\ud558\uac8c \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc808\ucc28\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uad6c\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 $\u03b5$-\ucd5c\uc801 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uacc4\uc0b0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559 \ucd94\uc815\uc5d0 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc218\uc9d1\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc5c6\ub294 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc5c4\ubc00\ud55c \ud558\ud55c\uc120\uc744 \uc815\ub9bd\ud558\uc5ec \uc54c\ub824\uc9c4 \uc0c1\ud55c\uc120\uacfc \ud558\ud55c\uc120\uc758 \uac04\uadf9\uc744 \uc881\ud614\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc678\ubd80 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \uad00\ucc30\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc54c\ub824\uc9c0\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\ud53c\uc18c\ub4dc \uc720\ud55c \uc9c0\ud3c9\uc120 \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815(MDP)\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc5c6\ub294 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uacfc \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubb34\uad00 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc5c6\ub294 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc740 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ud6c4\uc5d0 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub09c \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 $\u03b5$-\ucd5c\uc801 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud558\uba70, \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubb34\uad00 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc740 \uc18c\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc720\ud55c \ud074\ub798\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd94\ucd9c\ub41c \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 $\u03b5$-\ucd5c\uc801\uc131\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud55c\ub2e4. \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubb34\uad00 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c Li, Yan, Chen, \ubc0f Fan\uc740 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\uc740 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 $\u03b5$\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574\uc11c\ub9cc minimax \uc0d8\ud50c \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 $\u03b5$\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \uc644\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uadf8 \uc790\uccb4\ub85c \ub3c5\ucc3d\uc801\uc774\uba70 \uae30\uc220\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud765\ubbf8\ub86d\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc8fc\uc758 \uae4a\uac8c \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc808\ucc28\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc774 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub098\uba74 $\u03b5$-\ucd5c\uc801 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc815\ud655\ud788 \uacc4\uc0b0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc218\uc9d1\uc5d0 \ucda9\ubd84\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc5c6\ub294 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc5c4\ubc00\ud55c \ud558\ud55c\uc120\uc744 \uc218\ub9bd\ud558\uc5ec \uc54c\ub824\uc9c4 \uc0c1\ud55c\uc120\uacfc \ud558\ud55c\uc120 \uac04\uc758 \uac04\uadf9\uc744 \uc881\ud78c\ub2e4."}}

We compare two training regimes: a one-stage agent that jointly selects the gate type, the affected qubit(s), and the rotation angle; and a two-stage variant that first proposes a discrete circuit and subsequently optimizes the rotation angles with Adam using parameter-shift gradients. Using Gymnasium and PennyLane, we evaluate Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Advantage Actor--Critic (A2C) on systems comprising two to ten qubits and on targets of increasing complexity with \\(\u03bb\\) ranging from one to five. Whereas A2C does not learn effective policies in this setting, PPO succeeds under stable hyperparameters (one-stage: learning rate approximately \\(5\\times10^{-4}\\) with a self-fidelity-error threshold of 0.01; two-stage: learning rate approximately \\(10^{-4}\\)). Both approaches reliably reconstruct computational basis states (between 83\\% and 99\\% success) and Bell states (between 61\\% and 77\\% success). However, scalability saturates for \\(\u03bb\\) of approximately three to four and does not extend to ten-qubit targets even at \\(\u03bb=2\\). The two-stage method offers only marginal accuracy gains while requiring around three times the runtime. For practicality under a fixed compute budget, we therefore recommend the one-stage PPO policy, provide explicit synthesized circuits, and contrast with a classical variational baseline to outline avenues for improved scalability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\uc0b0 \uac8c\uc774\ud2b8 \uc120\ud0dd\uc5d0\uc11c \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ud654\ub41c \uc591\uc790 \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc900\ube44\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ub41c \uc9c0\ud5a5 \uc591\uc790 \ud68c\ub85c \ud569\uc131\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8ec\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc591\uc790 \ud68c\ub85c \ud569\uc131\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc591\uc790 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uace0\uc790 \ud558\uba70, \ud2b9\ud788 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ub2e8\uc77c \ud050\ube44\ud2b8 \ud68c\uc804\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc591\uc790 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \uc900\ube44\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud558\ub098\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uac8c\uc774\ud2b8 \uc720\ud615, \uad00\ub828 \ud050\ube44\ud2b8, \ud68c\uc804 \uac01\ub3c4\ub97c \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc77c\ub2e8\uacc4 \ubc29\uc2dd\uacfc, \uc774\uc0b0 \ud68c\ub85c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c \ud6c4 \uc544\ub2f4\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud574 \ud68c\uc804 \uac01\ub3c4\ub97c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc774\ub2e8\uacc4 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ube44\uad50\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "PPO\ub294 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uc5ec 83%\uc5d0\uc11c 99%\uc758 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uae30\ubc18 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc640 61%\uc5d0\uc11c 77%\uc758 \ubca8 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\uc600\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub450 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \uacbd\uc6b0 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc740 \ubbf8\ubbf8\ud558\uace0 \uc2e4\ud589 \uc2dc\uac04\uc774 \uc138 \ubc30 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uace0\uc815\ub41c \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc608\uc0b0\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud560 \ub54c, \uc77c\ub2e8\uacc4 PPO \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ucd94\ucc9c\ud558\uba70, \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc778 \ud569\uc131 \ud68c\ub85c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0 \uace0\uc804\uc801 \ubcc0\ubd84 \uae30\uc900\uc120\uacfc \ub300\uc870\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc21c\uc218\ud558\uac8c \uc774\uc0b0 \uac8c\uc774\ud2b8 \uc120\ud0dd\uc5d0\uc11c \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ud654\ub41c \uc591\uc790 \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc900\ube44\ub85c\uc758 \uc9c0\ud5a5 \uc591\uc790 \ud68c\ub85c \ud569\uc131(DQCS)\uc744 \ud655\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ube44\uad50\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uac8c\uc774\ud2b8 \uc720\ud615, \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubc1b\ub294 \ud050\ube44\ud2b8 \ubc0f \ud68c\uc804 \uac01\ub3c4\ub97c \ud568\uaed8 \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc77c\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \uba3c\uc800 \uc774\uc0b0 \ud68c\ub85c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c \ud6c4 \uc544\ub2f4\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud68c\uc804 \uac01\ub3c4\ub97c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc774\ub2e8\uacc4 \ubcc0\ud615\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.

While expert knowledge is required to construct principled causal graphs, many statistical methods have been proposed to leverage observational data with varying formal guarantees. Causal Assumption-based Argumentation (ABA) is a framework that uses symbolic reasoning to ensure correspondence between input constraints and output graphs, while offering a principled way to combine data and expertise. We explore the use of large language models (LLMs) as imperfect experts for Causal ABA, eliciting semantic structural priors from variable names and descriptions and integrating them with conditional-independence evidence. Experiments on standard benchmarks and semantically grounded synthetic graphs demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, and we additionally introduce an evaluation protocol to mitigate memorisation bias when assessing LLMs for causal discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc778\uacfc ABA\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ubd88\uc644\uc804\ud55c \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud558\uba70, \uc778\uacfc\uc801 \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud3c9\uac00 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc778\uacfc \ubc1c\uacac\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc778\uacfc \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ubc1d\ud600\ub0b4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uac1c\uc785\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubcc0\uc218 \uc774\ub984\uacfc \uc124\uba85\uc5d0\uc11c \uac00\uc838\uc628 \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc801 \uad6c\uc870 priors\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc778\uacfc ABA\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \uc870\uac74\uc801 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc131 \uc99d\uac70\uc640 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud45c\uc900 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ubc0f \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uae30\ubc18\uc744 \ub454 \ud569\uc131 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc778\uacfc \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \uc704\ud55c LLM\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc5b5 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud3c9\uac00 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc778\uacfc \ubc1c\uacac\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\uacfc \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ubc1d\ud600\ub0b4\uace0, \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\uacfc \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub85c \ud45c\ud604\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uac1c\uc785\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6d0\uce59\uc801\uc778 \uc778\uacfc \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud615\uc2dd\uc801 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \uad00\ucc30 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc5ec\ub7ec \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc81c\uc548\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc778\uacfc \uac00\uc815 \uae30\ubc18 \ub17c\uc99d(ABA)\uc740 \uc785\ub825 \uc81c\uc57d \uc870\uac74\uacfc \ucd9c\ub825 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uac04\uc758 \uc77c\uce58\ub97c \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uae30\ud638 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \uc804\ubb38\uc131\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uc6d0\uce59\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \uc778\uacfc ABA\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ubd88\uc644\uc804\ud55c \uc804\ubb38\uac00\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \ubcc0\uc218 \uc774\ub984\uacfc \uc124\uba85\uc5d0\uc11c \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc801 \uad6c\uc870 priors\ub97c \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \uc870\uac74\uc801 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc131 \uc99d\uac70\uc640 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud45c\uc900 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ubc0f \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uae30\ubc18\uc744 \ub454 \ud569\uc131 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uba70, LLM\uc744 \uc778\uacfc \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud560 \ub54c \uae30\uc5b5 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud3c9\uac00 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \ucd94\uac00\ub85c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Based on these observations, an investigation is conducted to determine whether the Agent Skill paradigm provides similar benefits to small language models (SLMs). This question matters in industrial scenarios where continuous reliance on public APIs is infeasible due to data-security and budget constraints requirements, and where SLMs often show limited generalization in highly customized scenarios. This work introduces a formal mathematical definition of the Agent Skill process, followed by a systematic evaluation of language models of varying sizes across multiple use cases. The evaluation encompasses two open-source tasks and a real-world insurance claims data set. The results show that tiny models struggle with reliable skill selection, while moderately sized SLMs (approximately 12B - 30B) parameters) benefit substantially from the Agent Skill approach. Moreover, code-specialized variants at around 80B parameters achieve performance comparable to closed-source baselines while improving GPU efficiency.

By leveraging data fusion and analytics techniques, traffic demand forecasting serves as a key intermediate measure for identifying emerging spatial and temporal demand patterns. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by proposing two gradient boosting model variations, one for classiffication and one for regression, both capable of generating demand forecasts at various temporal horizons, from 5 minutes up to one hour. Our overall approach effectively integrates temporal and contextual features, enabling accurate predictions that are essential for improving the efficiency of shared (micro-) mobility services. To evaluate its effectiveness, we utilize open shared mobility data derived from e-scooter and e-bike networks in five metropolitan areas. These real-world datasets allow us to compare our approach with state-of-the-art methods as well as a Generative AI-based model, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing the complexities of modern urban mobility.

While rising accuracy scores on standard benchmarks suggest rapid progress, many agents still continue to fail in practice. This discrepancy highlights a fundamental limitation of current evaluations: compressing agent behavior into a single success metric obscures critical operational flaws. Notably, it ignores whether agents behave consistently across runs, withstand perturbations, fail predictably, or have bounded error severity. Grounded in safety-critical engineering, we provide a holistic performance profile by proposing twelve concrete metrics that decompose agent reliability along four key dimensions: consistency, robustness, predictability, and safety. Evaluating 14 agentic models across two complementary benchmarks, we find that recent capability gains have only yielded small improvements in reliability. By exposing these persistent limitations, our metrics complement traditional evaluations while offering tools for reasoning about how agents perform, degrade, and fail.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd84\uc11d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc791\uc5c5 \uc218\ud589\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc2e4\ud328 \uc0ac\ub840\ub97c \uc904\uc774\uba70, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9 \ud3c9\uac00\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud568.", "method": "\uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131, \uc77c\uad00\uc131, \uacac\uace0\uc131, \uc608\uce21 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \ubc0f \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ubd84\ud574\ud558\ub294 12\uac1c\uc758 \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc778 \uc9c0\ud45c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "14\uac1c\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \ubcf4\uc644 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, \ucd5c\uadfc\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc774 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac1c\uc120\uc774 \ubbf8\ubbf8\ud568\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ud55c \uc9c0\ud45c\ub294 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \ubcf4\uc644\ud558\uba70 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \uc800\ud558, \uc2e4\ud328\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubc30\ud3ec\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud45c\uc900 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4 \uc810\uc218\uac00 \uc0c1\uc2b9\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc \ub9ce\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc2e4\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\ud328\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub294 \ud604\uc7ac \ud3c9\uac00\uc758 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc131\uacf5 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc73c\ub85c \uc555\ucd95\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc6b4\uc601 \uacb0\ud568\uc744 \uac00\ub9bd\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc2e4\ud589 \uac04 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ud589\ub3d9\ud558\ub294\uc9c0, \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc5d0 \uacac\ub514\ub294\uc9c0, \uc608\uce21 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \uc2e4\ud328\ud558\ub294\uc9c0, \uc624\ub958 \uc2ec\uac01\uc131\uc774 \ud55c\uc815\ub418\uc5c8\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ubb34\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc548\uc804 \ud544\uc218 \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\ub9c1\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uc5ec, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \uc77c\uad00\uc131, \uacac\uace0\uc131, \uc608\uce21 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \ubc0f \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc758 \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\ub294 12\uac1c\uc758 \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc778 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud504\ub85c\ud30c\uc77c\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \ubcf4\uc644\uc801\uc778 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c 14\uac1c\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, \ucd5c\uadfc\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc774 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubbf8\ubbf8\ud55c \uac1c\uc120\ub9cc\uc744 \uac00\uc838\uc654\uc74c\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b4\uba74\uc11c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc740 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \ubcf4\uc644\ud558\uace0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc218\ud589\ud558\uace0, \uc800\ud558\ud558\uace0, \uc2e4\ud328\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Such models often require discretization of continuous neural time series data, a process referred to as 'tokenization'. However, the impact of different tokenization strategies for neural data is currently poorly understood. In this work, we present a systematic evaluation of sample-level tokenization strategies for transformer-based large neuroimaging models (LNMs) applied to magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. We compare learnable and non-learnable tokenizers by examining their signal reconstruction fidelity and their impact on subsequent foundation modeling performance (token prediction, biological plausibility of generated data, preservation of subject-specific information, and performance on downstream tasks). For the learnable tokenizer, we introduce a novel approach based on an autoencoder. Experiments were conducted on three publicly available MEG datasets spanning different acquisition sites, scanners, and experimental paradigms. Our results show that both learnable and non-learnable discretization schemes achieve high reconstruction accuracy and broadly comparable performance across most evaluation criteria, suggesting that simple fixed sample-level tokenization strategies can be used in the development of neural foundation models.

Differential temporal difference (TD) learning algorithms are a major advance for average reward RL as they provide an efficient online method to learn the value functions associated with the average reward in both on-policy and off-policy settings. However, existing convergence guarantees require a local clock in learning rates tied to state visit counts, which practitioners do not use and does not extend beyond tabular settings. We address this limitation by proving the almost sure convergence of on-policy $n$-step differential TD for any $n$ using standard diminishing learning rates without a local clock. We then derive three sufficient conditions under which off-policy $n$-step differential TD also converges without a local clock. These results strengthen the theoretical foundations of differential TD and bring its convergence analysis closer to practical implementations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud3c9\uade0 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc218\ub834\uc131\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8e8\uba70, \ud2b9\ud788 \uc9c0\uc5ed \uc2dc\uacc4 \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 \uc218\ub834\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc218\ub834 \ubcf4\uc7a5 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc9c0\uc5ed \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uba70 \uc2e4\ubb34\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud45c\uc900 \uac10\uc18c \ud559\uc2b5\ub960\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc9c0\uc5ed \uc2dc\uacc4 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc5b4\ub5a4 n\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc628 \uc815\ucc45 n-\ub2e8\uacc4 \ucc28\ub4f1 TD\uc758 \uac70\uc758 \ud655\uc2e4\ud55c \uc218\ub834\uc131\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud558\uace0, \uc624\ud504 \uc815\ucc45 n-\ub2e8\uacc4 \ucc28\ub4f1 TD\uac00 \uc9c0\uc5ed \uc2dc\uacc4 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc218\ub834\ud558\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ucda9\ubd84\uc870\uac74\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc628 \uc815\ucc45 n-\ub2e8\uacc4 \ucc28\ub4f1 TD\uc758 \uac70\uc758 \ud655\uc2e4\ud55c \uc218\ub834\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uace0, \uc624\ud504 \uc815\ucc45\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc218\ub834 \uc870\uac74\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ucc28\ub4f1 TD\uc758 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \uac15\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uc2e4\uc81c \uad6c\ud604\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc218\ub834 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ub354 \uac00\uae5d\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4e0\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud3c9\uade0 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc7a5\uae30 \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd98 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc9c0\ud45c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucc28\ub4f1 \uc2dc\uac04 \ucc28\uc774(TD) \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \ud3c9\uade0 \ubcf4\uc0c1 RL\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc8fc\uc694\ud55c \ubc1c\uc804\uc73c\ub85c, \uc628 \uc815\ucc45 \ubc0f \uc624\ud504 \uc815\ucc45 \uc124\uc815 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uade0 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ub41c \uac00\uce58 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc218\ub834 \ubcf4\uc7a5 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc0c1\ud0dc \ubc29\ubb38 \ud69f\uc218\uc5d0 \uc5f0\uacb0\ub41c \ud559\uc2b5\ub960\uc758 \uc9c0\uc5ed \uc2dc\uacc4\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc2e4\ubb34\uc790\ub4e4\uc774 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba70 \ud45c \ud615\uc2dd \uc124\uc815\uc744 \ub118\uc5b4 \ud655\uc7a5\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc9c0\uc5ed \uc2dc\uacc4 \uc5c6\uc774 \ud45c\uc900 \uac10\uc18c \ud559\uc2b5\ub960\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc5b4\ub5a4 n\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc628 \uc815\ucc45 n-\ub2e8\uacc4 \ucc28\ub4f1 TD\uc758 \uac70\uc758 \ud655\uc2e4\ud55c \uc218\ub834\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7f0 \ub2e4\uc74c \uc9c0\uc5ed \uc2dc\uacc4 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc624\ud504 \uc815\ucc45 n-\ub2e8\uacc4 \ucc28\ub4f1 TD\ub3c4 \uc218\ub834\ud558\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ucda9\ubd84\uc870\uac74\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ucc28\ub4f1 TD\uc758 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \uac15\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uc2e4\uc81c \uad6c\ud604\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc218\ub834 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ub354 \uac00\uae5d\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4ed\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}
