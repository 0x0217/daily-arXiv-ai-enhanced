Network Effects, History, and Machine Optimism", "comment": "7 pages, 5 figures", "summary": "Understanding decision-making in multi-AI-agent frameworks is crucial for analyzing strategic interactions in network-effect-driven contexts. This study investigates how AI agents navigate network-effect games, where individual payoffs depend on peer participatio--a context underexplored in multi-agent systems despite its real-world prevalence. We introduce a novel workflow design using large language model (LLM)-based agents in repeated decision-making scenarios, systematically manipulating price trajectories (fixed, ascending, descending, random) and network-effect strength. Our key findings include: First, without historical data, agents fail to infer equilibrium. Second, ordered historical sequences (e.g., escalating prices) enable partial convergence under weak network effects but strong effects trigger persistent \"AI optimism\"--agents overestimate participation despite contradictory evidence. Third, randomized history disrupts convergence entirely, demonstrating that temporal coherence in data shapes LLMs' reasoning, unlike humans. These results highlight a paradigm shift: in AI-mediated systems, equilibrium outcomes depend not just on incentives, but on how history is curated, which is impossible for human.", "AI": {"tldr":

These multi-agent architectures enable coordinated reasoning, planning, and execution across diverse domains, allowing agents to collaboratively automate complex workflows. Despite these advances, evaluation and assessment of LLM agents and the multi-agent systems they constitute remain a fundamental challenge. Although various approaches have been proposed in the software engineering literature for evaluating conventional software components, existing methods for AI-based systems often overlook the non-deterministic nature of models. This non-determinism introduces behavioral uncertainty during execution, yet existing evaluations rely on binary task completion metrics that fail to capture it. Evaluating agentic systems therefore requires examining additional dimensions, including the agent ability to invoke tools, ingest and retrieve memory, collaborate with other agents, and interact effectively with its environment. We propose an end-to-end Agent Assessment Framework with four evaluation pillars encompassing LLMs, Memory, Tools, and Environment. We validate the framework on a representative Autonomous CloudOps use case, where experiments reveal behavioral deviations overlooked by conventional metrics, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing runtime uncertainties.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4

Algorithms like Shor's factoring and Grover's search threaten to dismantle the public-key infrastructure (PKI) securing sovereign communications and financial transactions. While the timeline for fault-tolerant CRQCs remains probabilistic, the \"Store-Now, Decrypt-Later\" (SNDL) model necessitates immediate migration to Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC). This transition is hindered by the velocity of research, evolving NIST standards, and heterogeneous deployment environments. To address this, we present Quantigence, a theory-driven multi-agent AI framework for structured quantum-security analysis. Quantigence decomposes research objectives into specialized roles - Cryptographic Analyst, Threat Modeler, Standards Specialist, and Risk Assessor - coordinated by a supervisory agent. Using \"cognitive parallelism,\" agents reason independently to maintain context purity while execution is serialized on resource-constrained hardware (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 2060). The framework integrates external knowledge via the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and prioritizes vulnerabilities using the Quantum-Adjusted Risk Score (QARS), a formal extension of Mosca's Theorem. Empirical validation shows Quantigence achieves a 67% reduction in research turnaround time and superior literature coverage compared to manual workflows, democratizing access to high-fidelity quantum risk assessment.", "AI": {"tldr": "CRQC\ub294 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uacbd\uc81c\uc5d0 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc704\ud611\uc744 \uac00\ud558\uba70, PQC\ub85c\uc758 \uc989\uac01\uc801\uc778 \uc804\ud658\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.

The Artificial Age Score (AAS) was previously introduced and mathematically justified through three theorems that characterise it as a metric of artificial memory aging. Building on this foundation, the present work develops an engineering-oriented, clause-based architecture that imposes law-like constraints on LLM memory and control. Twenty selected monads from Leibniz's Monadology are grouped into six bundles: ontology, dynamics, representation and consciousness, harmony and reason, body and organisation, and teleology, and each bundle is realised as an executable specification on top of the AAS kernel. Across six minimal Python implementations, these clause families are instantiated in numerical experiments acting on channel-level quantities such as recall scores, redundancy, and weights. Each implementation follows a four-step pattern: inputs and setup, clause implementation, numerical results, and implications for LLM design, emphasising that the framework is not only philosophically motivated but also directly implementable. The experiments show that the clause system exhibits bounded and interpretable behavior: AAS trajectories remain continuous and rate-limited, contradictions and unsupported claims trigger explicit penalties, and hierarchical refinement reveals an organic structure in a controlled manner.

We introduce value profiles: a small set of reusable bundles of value-related parameters (outcome preferences, policy priors, and policy precision) assigned to hidden states in a generative model. As posterior beliefs over states evolve trial by trial, effective control parameters arise via belief-weighted mixing, enabling state-conditional strategy recruitment without requiring independent parameters for each context. We evaluate this framework in probabilistic reversal learning, comparing static-precision, entropy-coupled dynamic-precision, and profile-based models using cross-validated log-likelihood and information criteria. Model comparison favors the profile-based model over simpler alternatives (about 100-point AIC differences), and parameter-recovery analyses support structural identifiability even when context must be inferred from noisy observations. Model-based inference further suggests that adaptive control in this task is driven primarily by modulation of policy priors rather than policy precision, with gradual belief-dependent profile recruitment consistent with state-conditional (not purely uncertainty-driven) control. Overall, reusable value profiles provide a tractable computational account of belief-conditioned value control in volatile environments and yield testable signatures of belief-dependent control and behavioral flexibility.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc774 \ud070 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uac00\uce58 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9

While these agents help automate repetitive online tasks, they are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks that can trick an agent into performing undesired actions, such as leaking private information or issuing state-changing requests. We propose ceLLMate, a browser-level sandboxing framework that restricts the agent's ambient authority and reduces the blast radius of prompt injections. We address two fundamental challenges: (1) The semantic gap challenge in policy enforcement arises because the agent operates through low-level UI observations and manipulations; however, writing and enforcing policies directly over UI-level events is brittle and error-prone. To address this challenge, we introduce an agent sitemap that maps low-level browser behaviors to high-level semantic actions. (2) Policy prediction in BUAs is the norm rather than the exception. BUAs have no app developer to pre-declare sandboxing policies, and thus, ceLLMate pairs website-authored mandatory policies with an automated policy-prediction layer that adapts and instantiates these policies from the user's natural-language task. We implement ceLLMate as an agent-agnostic browser extension and demonstrate how it enables sandboxing policies that effectively block various types of prompt injection attacks with negligible overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "ceLLMate\ub294 \uc6f9 \ube0c\ub77c\uc6b0\uc800\uc640 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ube0c\ub77c\uc6b0\uc800 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc0cc\ub4dc\ubc15\uc2a4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc8fc\uc785 \uacf5\uaca9\uc758 \uc601\ud5a5 \ubc18\uacbd\uc744 \uc904\uc778\ub2e4.", "motivation": "BUA\uac00 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub3d9\uc548, \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc8fc\uc785 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud574\uc9c4\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc800\uc790\ub294 \uc800\uc218\uc900\uc758 UI \uad00\ucc30\uacfc \uc870\uc791\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub192\uc740 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ub9e4\ud551\ub418\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc0ac\uc774\ud2b8\ub9f5\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0, \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc758 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud5c8\uc6a9\ub41c \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc608\uce21\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc801\uc751\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\ub97c \ucd94\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "ceLLMate\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc720\ud615\uc758 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc8fc\uc785 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucc28\ub2e8\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc0cc\ub4dc\ubc15\uc2a4 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "ceLLMate\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ube44\uc885\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ube0c\ub77c\uc6b0\uc800 \ud655\uc7a5\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\ud604\ub418\uc5b4 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uba70, \uacbd\ubbf8\ud55c \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub85c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \ucc28\ub2e8\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ube0c\ub77c\uc6b0\uc800 \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8(BUA)\ub294 \ud074\ub9ad, \uc2a4\ud06c\ub864, \uc591\uc2dd \uc791\uc131 \ubc0f \ud398\uc774\uc9c0 \uac04 \ub0b4\ube44\uac8c\uc774\uc158\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uc5ec \uc6f9 \ube0c\ub77c\uc6b0\uc800\uc640 \uc778\uac04\uacfc \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc0c1\ud638 \uc791\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc744 \uc8fc\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc720\ucd9c\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc0c1\ud0dc \ubcc0\uacbd \uc694\uccad\uc744 \ubc1c\ud589\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc6d0\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc18d\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc8fc\uc785 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc8fc\ubcc0 \uad8c\ud55c\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud558\uace0 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc8fc\uc785\uc758 \uc601\ud5a5 \ubc18\uacbd\uc744 \uc904\uc774\ub294 \ube0c\ub77c\uc6b0\uc800 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc0cc\ub4dc\ubc15\uc2a4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 ceLLMate\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: (1) \uc815\ucc45 \uc9d1\ud589\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \uaca9\ucc28 \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc800\uc218\uc900 UI \uad00\ucc30 \ubc0f \uc870\uc791\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 UI \uc218\uc900 \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc9c1\uc811 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc791\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uc9d1\ud589\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ubd88\uc548\uc815\ud558\uace0 \uc624\ub958\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uae30 \uc27d\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc800\uc218\uc900 \ube0c\ub77c\uc6b0\uc800 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ub192\uc740 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ub9e4\ud551\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc0ac\uc774\ud2b8\ub9f5\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

The original work reports strong performance and suggests that recursive latent updates enable non-trivial reasoning, but it remains unclear how much of this performance stems from architecture, test-time compute, or task-specific priors. In this technical note, we empirically analyze the ARC Prize TRM checkpoint on ARC-AGI-1 and report four behavioral findings and an efficiency comparison. First, we show that test-time augmentation and majority-vote ensembling account for a substantial fraction of reported performance: the 1000-sample voting pipeline improves Pass@1 by about 11 percentage points over single-pass canonical inference. Second, a puzzle-identity ablation reveals strict dependence on task identifiers: replacing the correct puzzle ID with a blank or random token yields zero accuracy. Third, a recursion trajectory analysis shows that most of the final accuracy is achieved at the first recursion step and that performance saturates after few latent updates, indicating shallow effective recursion. Fourth, early-stage training experiments under canonical versus heavy augmentation regimes suggest that heavy augmentation broadens the distribution of candidate solutions and improves multi-sample success. Finally, we compare TRM with a naive QLoRA fine-tune of Llama 3 8B on canonical ARC-AGI-1, finding that TRM's non-autoregressive design achieves much higher throughput and substantially lower memory usage in this setting. Overall, TRM's ARC-AGI-1 performance appears to arise from an interaction between efficiency, task-specific conditioning, and aggressive test-time compute rather than deep internal reasoning.", "AI":

While this has unlocked potential for human productivity gains, the attack surface has expanded accordingly: threats now span content safety failures (e.g., harmful or deceptive outputs), model and data integrity compromise (e.g., poisoning, supply-chain tampering), runtime manipulations (e.g., prompt injection, tool and agent misuse), and ecosystem risks (e.g., orchestration abuse, multi-agent collusion). Existing frameworks such as MITRE ATLAS, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) AI 100-2 Adversarial Machine Learning (AML) taxonomy, and OWASP Top 10s for Large Language Models (LLMs) and Agentic AI Applications provide valuable viewpoints, but each covers only slices of this multi-dimensional space.\n  This paper presents Cisco's Integrated AI Security and Safety Framework (\"AI Security Framework\"), a unified, lifecycle-aware taxonomy and operationalization framework that can be used to classify, integrate, and operationalize the full range of AI risks. It integrates AI security and AI safety across modalities, agents, pipelines, and the broader ecosystem. The AI Security Framework is designed to be practical for threat identification, red-teaming, risk prioritization, and it is comprehensive in scope and can be extensible to emerging deployments in multimodal contexts, humanoids, wearables, and sensory infrastructures. We analyze gaps in prevailing frameworks, discuss design principles for our framework, and demonstrate how the taxonomy provides structure for understanding how modern AI systems fail, how adversaries exploit these failures, and how organizations can build defenses across the AI lifecycle that evolve alongside capability advancements.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ucc44\ud0dd\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ubcf4\uc548 \uc704\ud5d8\uc774 \ud655\ub300\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 AI \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ubd84\ub958\ud558\uace0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 Cisco\uc758 \ud1b5\ud569 AI \ubcf4\uc548 \ubc0f \uc548\uc804 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5(AI) \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc2e0\uc18d\ud55c \ucc44\ud0dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ube44\uc988\ub2c8\uc2a4 \ubc0f \uac1c\uc778 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0dd\uc0b0\uc131 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc774 \uc5f4\ub9ac\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ubcf4\uc548 \uc704\ud611\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "Cisco\uc758 \ud1b5\ud569 AI \ubcf4\uc548 \ubc0f \uc548\uc804 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 AI \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ubd84\ub958, \ud1b5\ud569 \ubc0f \uc6b4\uc601\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569\ub41c \uc0dd\uc560 \uc8fc\uae30 \uc778\uc2dd \ubd84\ub958 \uccb4\uacc4\uc774\ub2e4.", "result": "AI \ubcf4\uc548 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc704\ud611 \uc2dd\ubcc4, \ub808\ub4dc \ud300 \uc804\ub7b5, \uc704\ud5d8 \uc6b0\uc120 \uc21c\uc704 \uc9c0\uc815\uc5d0 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc774\uba70, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud615\ud0dc\uc758 AI \uc704\ud5d8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 AI \uc0dd\uc560 \uc8fc\uae30 \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \ud604\ub300\uc801\uc778 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc2e4\ud328 \uc774\ud574 \ubc0f \ubc29\uc5b4 \uad6c\ucd95\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5(AI) \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uc18c\ube44\uc790 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc \ubc0f \uae30\uc5c5 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \uc774\ub974\uae30\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc601\uc5ed\uc5d0 \uc2e0\uc18d\ud558\uac8c \ucc44\ud0dd\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ucc44\ud0dd\uc740 \uc778\ub958\uc758 \uc0dd\uc0b0\uc131 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uc5f4\uc5b4 \uc8fc\uc5c8\uc73c\ub098, \uc704\ud611\uc758 \ud45c\uba74 \ub610\ud55c \ud655\ub300\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ucf58\ud150\uce20 \uc548\uc804 \uc2e4\ud328, \ubaa8\ub378 \ubc0f \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubb34\uacb0\uc131 \ud6fc\uc190, \ub7f0\ud0c0\uc784 \uc870\uc791 \ubc0f \uc0dd\ud0dc\uacc4 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uadc0\uc911\ud55c \uad00\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub098, \uac01\uae30 \uc774 \ub2e4\ucc28\uc6d0\uc801 \uacf5\uac04\uc758 \uc77c\ubd80\ub9cc\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8ec\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 AI \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ubd84\ub958\ud558\uace0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 Cisco\uc758 \ud1b5\ud569 AI \ubcf4\uc548 \ubc0f \uc548\uc804 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, AI \ubcf4\uc548\uacfc \uc548\uc804\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc704\ud611 \uc2dd\ubcc4 \ubc0f \uc704\ud5d8 \uc6b0\uc120 \uc21c\uc704 \uc9c0\uc815\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc124\uacc4\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 AI \uc0dd\uc560 \uc8fc\uae30 \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \ud604\ub300\uc801\uc778 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc2e4\ud328 \ubc0f \ubc29\uc5b4 \uad6c\ucd95\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

While the utility of adding user data often exhibits diminishing returns (i.e., submodularity), enabling near-optimal greedy selection, real-world personalization is complicated by structural constraints. These include logical dependencies (e.g., selecting fact A requires fact B), categorical quotas (e.g., select at most one writing style), and hierarchical rules (e.g., select at most two social media preferences, of which at most one can be for a professional network). These constraints violate the assumptions of standard subset selection algorithms. We propose a principled method to formally model such constraints. We introduce a compilation process that transforms a user's knowledge graph with dependencies into a set of abstract macro-facets. Our central result is a proof that common hierarchical and quota-based constraints over these macro-facets form a valid laminar matroid. This theoretical characterization lets us cast structured personalization as submodular maximization under a matroid constraint, enabling greedy with constant-factor guarantees (and (1-1/e) via

Finch is sourced from authentic enterprise workspaces at Enron (15,000 spreadsheets and 500,000 emails from 150 employees) and other financial institutions, preserving in-the-wild messiness across multimodal artifacts (text, tables, formulas, charts, code, and images) and spanning diverse domains such as budgeting, trading, and asset management.\n  We propose a workflow construction process that combines LLM-assisted discovery with expert annotation: (1) LLM-assisted, expert-verified derivation of workflows from real-world email threads and version histories of spreadsheet files, and (2) meticulous expert annotation for workflows, requiring over 700 hours of domain-expert effort.

However, recent work suggests that relying on approximate symmetry can offer greater flexibility and robustness. Despite promising empirical evidence, there has been little theoretical understanding, and in particular, a direct comparison between exact and approximate symmetry is missing from the literature. In this paper, we initiate this study by asking: What is the cost of enforcing exact versus approximate symmetry? To address this question, we introduce averaging complexity, a framework for quantifying the cost of enforcing symmetry via averaging. Our main result is an exponential separation: under standard conditions, achieving exact symmetry requires linear averaging complexity, whereas approximate symmetry can be attained with only logarithmic averaging complexity. To the best of our knowledge, this provides the first theoretical separation of these two cases, formally justifying why approximate symmetry may be preferable in practice. Beyond this, our tools and techniques may be of independent interest for the broader study of symmetries in machine learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc815\ud655\ud55c \ub300\uce6d\uc744 \uac15\uc81c\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \uc751\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc774\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uadfc\uc0ac \ub300\uce6d\uc758 \ud65c\uc6a9\uc774 \ub354 \uc720\uc5f0\uc131\uacfc \uacac\uace0\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90c.", "motivation": "\uc815\ud655\ud55c \ub300\uce6d\uacfc \uadfc\uc0ac \ub300\uce6d \uac04\uc758 \ube44\uad50 \ubd80\uc871\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc774\ud574\ub97c \uc99d\uc9c4\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud568.", "method": "\ub300\uce6d\uc744 \uac15\uc81c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ud3c9\uade0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud568.", "result": "\uc815\ud655\ud55c \ub300\uce6d\uc740 \uc120\ud615 \ud3c9\uade0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uadfc\uc0ac \ub300\uce6d\uc740 \ub85c\uadf8 \ud3c9\uade0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \ub2ec\uc131 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uc9c0\uc218\uc801 \ubd84\ub9ac\uac00 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc9d0.", "conclusion": "\uadfc\uc0ac \ub300\uce6d\uc774 \uc2e4\uc81c\ub85c \uc120\ud638\ub418\ub294 \uc774\uc720\ub97c \uc815\ub2f9\ud654\ud558\uba70, \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ub3c4\uad6c\uc640 \uae30\ubc95\uc740 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub300\uce6d \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c\ub3c4 \ud765\ubbf8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uac00\uce58\ub97c \uac00\uc9c8 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c.", "translated_summary": "\uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ub300\uce6d\uc744 \uac15\uc81c\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \uc751\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc774\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc5ec \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc720\ub3c4 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ucd5c\uadfc \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uadfc\uc0ac \ub300\uce6d\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ub354 \ud070 \uc720\uc5f0\uc131\uacfc \uacac\uace0\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \uc99d\uac70\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc774\ud574\ub294 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uba70, \ud2b9\ud788 \ubb38\ud5cc\uc5d0\ub294 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ub300\uce6d\uacfc \uadfc\uc0ac \ub300\uce6d \uac04\uc758 \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc778 \ube44\uad50\uac00 \uacb0\uc5ec\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ub300\uce6d\uacfc \uadfc\uc0ac \ub300\uce6d\uc744 \uac15\uc81c\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc758 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ubb34\uc5c7\uc778\uc9c0 \uc9c8\ubb38\ud558\uba70 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc2dc\uc791\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub300\uce6d\uc744 \ud3c9\uade0\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \uac15\uc81c\ud558\ub294 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud3c9\uade0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc9c0\uc218\uc801 \ubd84\ub9ac\ub85c, \ud45c\uc900 \uc870\uac74 \ud558\uc5d0 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ub300\uce6d\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uc120\ud615 \ud3c9\uade0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uadfc\uc0ac \ub300\uce6d\uc740 \uc624\uc9c1 \ub85c\uadf8 \ud3c9\uade0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \ub2ec\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c\ub294, \uc774\ub294 \uc774 \ub450 \uacbd\uc6b0\uc758 \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ubd84\ub9ac\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uc65c \uadfc\uc0ac \ub300\uce6d\uc774 \uc2e4\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub354 \uc120\ud638\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uacf5\uc2dd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\ub2f9\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\uc678\uc5d0\ub3c4, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc640 \uae30\ubc95\uc740 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub300\uce6d \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c\ub3c4 \ud765\ubbf8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uac00\uce58\uac00 \uc788\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4."}}

Hastings"], "title": "Weak Enforcement and Low Compliance in PCI~DSS: A Comparative Security Study", "comment": "6 pages, 1 figure, 7 tables", "summary": "Although credit and debit card data continue to be a prime target for attackers, organizational adherence to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) remains surprisingly low. Despite prior work showing that PCI DSS can reduce card fraud, only 32.4% of organizations were fully compliant in 2022, suggesting possible deficiencies in enforcement mechanisms. This study compares PCI DSS with three data security frameworks, HIPAA, NIS2, and GDPR, to examine how enforcement mechanisms relate to implementation success. The analysis reveals that PCI DSS significantly lags far behind these security frameworks and that its sanctions are orders of magnitude smaller than those under GDPR and NIS2. The findings indicate a positive association between stronger, multi-modal enforcement (including public disclosure, license actions, and imprisonment) and higher implementation rates, and highlights the structural weakness of PCI DSS's bank-dependent monitoring model. Enhanced non-monetary sanctions and the creation of an independent supervisory authority are recommended to increase transparency, reduce conflicts of interest, and improve PCI DSS compliance without discouraging card acceptance.", "AI": {"tldr": "PCI DSS\uc758 \uc2dc\ud589 \uc131\uacf5\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ub41c \uc9d1\ud589 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ube44\uad50\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, PCI DSS\ub294 HIPAA, NIS2 \ubc0f GDPR\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud604\uc800\ud558\uac8c \ub4a4\ucc98\uc838 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ub354 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \uc9d1\ud589\uc774 \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \uc2dc\ud589\ub960\uacfc \uae0d\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4\ub294 \uc5f0\uad6c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2e0\uc6a9\uce74\ub4dc\uc640 \uc9c1\ubd88\uce74\ub4dc \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub294 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uacf5\uaca9\uc790\ub4e4\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \ud45c\uc801\uc774\ub098, PCI DSS \uc900\uc218\uc728\uc740 \ub0ae\uc740 \uc0c1\ud669\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "PCI DSS\ub97c HIPAA, NIS2, GDPR\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec \uc2dc\ud589 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774 \uc2e4\ud589 \uc131\uacf5\uacfc \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uad00\ub828\ub418\ub294\uc9c0 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "PCI DSS\ub294 \ub2e4\ub978 \ubcf4\uc548 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ud604\uc800\ud788 \ub4a4\ucc98\uc838 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, PCI DSS\uc758 \uc81c\uc7ac\ub294 GDPR \ubc0f NIS2\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc218\ub7c9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub354 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ube44\ud654\ud3d0\uc801 \uc81c\uc7ac\uc640 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \uac10\ub3c5 \uae30\uad00\uc758 \uc124\ub9bd\uc774 \ud22c\uba85\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uace0 \uc774\uc775 \ucda9\ub3cc\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uba70 \uce74\ub4dc \uc218\uc6a9\uc744 \uc800\ud574\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba74\uc11c PCI DSS \uc900\uc218\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ucd94\ucc9c\ub41c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc2e0\uc6a9\uce74\ub4dc \ubc0f \uc9c1\ubd88\uce74\ub4dc \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub294 \uacc4\uc18d\ud574\uc11c \uacf5\uaca9\uc790\ub4e4\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \ud45c\uc801\uc774 \ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uacb0\uc81c \uce74\ub4dc \uc0b0\uc5c5 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubcf4\uc548 \ud45c\uc900(PCI DSS)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc870\uc9c1\uc758 \uc900\uc218\uc728\uc740 \ub180\ub77c\uc6b8 \uc815\ub3c4\ub85c \ub0ae\ub2e4.

Here we introduce AGAPI (AtomGPT.org API), an open-access agentic AI platform that integrates more than eight open-source LLMs with over twenty materials-science API endpoints, unifying databases, simulation tools, and machine-learning models through a common orchestration framework. AGAPI employs an Agent-Planner-Executor-Summarizer architecture that autonomously constructs and executes multi-step workflows spanning materials data retrieval, graph neural network property prediction, machine-learning force-field optimization, tight-binding calculations, diffraction analysis, and inverse design. We demonstrate AGAPI through end-to-end workflows, including heterostructure construction, powder X-ray diffraction analysis, and semiconductor defect engineering requiring up to ten sequential operations. In addition, we evaluate AGAPI using 30+ example prompts as test cases and compare agentic predictions with and without tool access against experimental data. With more than 1,000 active users, AGAPI provides a scalable and transparent foundation for reproducible, AI-accelerated materials discovery.

By integrating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), aerial base stations, and terrestrial base stations, LAINs can support mission-critical applications such as disaster response, environmental monitoring, and real-time sensing. However, these systems face key challenges, including energy-constrained UAVs, stochastic task arrivals, and heterogeneous computing resources. To address these issues, we propose an integrated air-ground collaborative network and formulate a time-dependent integer nonlinear programming problem that jointly optimizes UAV trajectory planning and task offloading decisions. The problem is challenging to solve due to temporal coupling among decision variables. Therefore, we design a hierarchical learning framework with two timescales. At the large timescale, a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves auction mechanism enables the energy-aware and incentive-compatible trajectory assignment. At the small timescale, we propose the diffusion-heterogeneous-agent proximal policy optimization, a generative multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm that embeds latent diffusion models into actor networks. Each UAV samples actions from a Gaussian prior and refines them via observation-conditioned denoising, enhancing adaptability and policy diversity. Extensive simulations show that our framework outperforms baselines in energy efficiency, task success rate, and convergence performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc800\uace0\ub3c4 \uc9c0\ub2a5\ud615

Koch", "Stephan Krenn", "Alexandra Hofer"], "title": "QoeSiGN: Towards Qualified Collaborative eSignatures", "comment": null, "summary": "eSignatures ensure data's authenticity, non-repudiation, and integrity. EU's eIDAS regulation specifies, e.g., advanced and qualified (QES) eSignatures. While eSignatures' concrete legal effects depend on the individual case, QESs constitute the highest level of technical protection and authenticity under eIDAS. QESs are based on a qualified certificate issued by a qualified trust service provider (QTSP). Despite legal requirements, technically, a QTSP represents a single point of failure. Contrary, privacy-preserving collaborative computations (P2C2s) have become increasingly practical in recent years; yet lacking an extensive investigation on potential integrations in the QES landscape.\n  We perform a threat analysis on the QES-creation process of Austria's national eID, using STRIDE and a DREAD-like model to extract requirement challenges (RCs) primarily related to: (1) Distributed Service Robustness, (2) Agile Crypto Deployment, and (3) Active User Involvement. To address these RCs, we present QoeSiGN, utilizing novel P2C2 technologies. While currently no P2C2 addresses all RCs, legal aspects, and practical efficiency simultaneously, QoeSiGN gives instantiation possibilities for different needs. For instance, \"Multi-Party HSMs\" for distributed hardware-secured computations; or secure multi-party computation (software) for highest crypto agility and user involvement, where the user participates in the QES computation.\n  Deployment-wise, QTSPs would need to adapt the signing process and setup trusted communication channels. Legal-wise, QoeSiGN's implementation appears permissible, needing further analysis for realization. Technically, QoeSiGN addresses some regulation requirements better than the current solution, such as \"sole control\" or crypto agility.

While typical game-theoretic assumptions often overlook such heterogeneity, hypergame theory provides the mathematical framework to reason about mismatched mental models. Although hypergames have recently gained traction in dynamic applications concerning uncertainty, their practical adoption in multi-agent system research has been hindered by the lack of a unifying, formal, and practical representation language, as well as scalable algorithms for managing complex hypergame structures and equilibria. Our work addresses this gap by introducing a declarative, logic-based domain-specific language for encoding hypergame structures and hypergame solution concepts. Leveraging answer-set programming, we develop an automated pipeline for instantiating hypergame structures and running our novel hypergame rationalisation procedure, a mechanism for finding belief structures that justify seemingly irrational outcomes. The proposed language establishes a unifying formalism for hypergames and serves as a foundation for developing nuanced, belief-based heterogeneous reasoners, offering a verifiable context with logical guarantees. Together, these contributions establish the connection between hypergame theory, multi-agent systems, and strategic AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\uac8c\uc784

Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs) are widely used for interpreting black-box models by showing the average effect of an input variable on the prediction. However, their global sensitivity metric can be misleading when strong interactions are present, as averaging tends to obscure interaction effects. To address this limitation, we propose a global sensitivity metric based on Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) curves. The method computes the expected feature importance across ICE curves, along with their standard deviation, to more effectively capture the influence of interactions. We provide a mathematical proof demonstrating that the PDP-based sensitivity is a lower bound of the proposed ICE-based metric under truncated orthogonal polynomial expansion. In addition, we introduce an ICE-based correlation value to quantify how interactions modify the relationship between inputs and the output. Comparative evaluations were performed on three cases: a 5-variable analytical function, a 5-variable wind-turbine fatigue problem, and a 9-variable airfoil aerodynamics case, where ICE-based sensitivity was benchmarked against PDP, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), and Sobol' indices. The results show that ICE-based feature importance provides richer insights than the traditional PDP-based approach, while visual interpretations from PDP, ICE, and SHAP complement one another by offering multiple perspectives.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud574\uc11d\uc744 \uc704\ud574 Individual Conditional Expectation

Traditional log analysis techniques, including template-based and sequence-driven approaches, often lose important semantic information or struggle with ambiguous log patterns. To address this, we present EnrichLog, a training-free, entry-based anomaly detection framework that enriches raw log entries with both corpus-specific and sample-specific knowledge. EnrichLog incorporates contextual information, including historical examples and reasoning derived from the corpus, to enable more accurate and interpretable anomaly detection. The framework leverages retrieval-augmented generation to integrate relevant contextual knowledge without requiring retraining. We evaluate EnrichLog on four large-scale system log benchmark datasets and compare it against five baseline methods.

We introduce GraphPerf-RT, the first surrogate that unifies task DAG topology, CFG-derived code semantics, and runtime context (per-core\n  DVFS, thermal state, utilization) in a heterogeneous graph representation with typed edges encoding precedence, placement, and contention. Multi-task evidential heads predict\n  makespan, energy, cache and branch misses, and utilization with calibrated uncertainty (Normal-Inverse-Gamma), enabling risk-aware scheduling that filters low-confidence rollouts.\n  We validate GraphPerf-RT on three embedded ARM platforms (Jetson TX2, Jetson Orin NX, RUBIK Pi), achieving R^2 > 0.95 with well-calibrated uncertainty (ECE < 0.05). To\n  demonstrate end-to-end scheduling utility, we integrate the surrogate with four RL methods on Jetson TX2: single-agent model-free (SAMFRL), single-agent model-based (SAMBRL),\n  multi-agent model-free (MAMFRL-D3QN), and multi-agent model-based (MAMBRL-D3QN). Experiments across 5 seeds (200 episodes each) show that MAMBRL-D3QN with GraphPerf-RT as the\n  world model achieves 66% makespan reduction (0.97 +/- 0.35s) and 82% energy reduction (0.006 +/- 0.005J) compared to model-free baselines, demonstrating that accurate,\n  uncertainty-aware surrogates enable effective model-based planning on thermally constrained embedded systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc784\ubca0\ub514\ub4dc \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c OpenMP \uc791\uc5c5 \ubd80\ud558\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud55c GraphPerf-RT\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc791\uc5c5 DAG \uad6c\uc870, \uc81c\uc5b4 \ud750\ub984\uc758 \ubd88\uaddc\uce59\uc131, \uce90\uc2dc \ubc0f \ubd84\uae30 \ub3d9\uc791, \uc5f4 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559 \uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc608\uce21\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc640 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "OpenMP \uc791\uc5c5 \ubd80\ud558\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc608\uce21\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc5b4\ub835\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1\uacfc \ubaa8\ub378 \ud504\ub9ac RL \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubd88\uaddc\uce59\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\ub300\ub85c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "GraphPerf-RT\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5 DAG \ud1a0\ud3f4\ub85c\uc9c0, CFG\uc5d0\uc11c \ud30c\uc0dd\ub41c \ucf54\ub4dc \uc758\ubbf8 \ubc0f \ub7f0\ud0c0\uc784 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ud45c\ud604\uc73c\ub85c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uba70, \uba40\ud2f0 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc99d\uac70 \ud5e4\ub4dc\ub294 \uc870\uc815\ub41c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub9ac\uc18c\uc2a4 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "GraphPerf-RT\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc784\ubca0\ub514\ub4dc ARM \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc(Jetson TX2, Jetson Orin NX, RUBIK Pi)\uc5d0\uc11c \uac80\uc99d\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, R^2 > 0.95\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\uc640 \ud568\uaed8 \uc798 \uc870\uc815\ub41c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc815\ud655\ud558\uace0 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uc778\uc2dd\ud558\ub294 \ub300\uccb4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574, \uc5f4 \uc81c\uc57d\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uc784\ubca0\ub514\ub4dc \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18 \uacc4\ud68d\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc784\ubca0\ub514\ub4dc \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c OpenMP \uc791\uc5c5 \ubd80\ud558\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud55c GraphPerf-RT\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc791\uc5c5 DAG \uad6c\uc870, \uc81c\uc5b4 \ud750\ub984\uc758 \ubd88\uaddc\uce59\uc131, \uce90\uc2dc \ubc0f \ubd84\uae30 \ub3d9\uc791, \uc5f4 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559 \uac04\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc608\uce21\uc740 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1 \uae30\ubc95\uc740 \uc791\uc5c5 \ubd80\ud558\uc758 \ubd88\uaddc\uce59\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ucc98\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0, \ud45c \uae30\ubc18 \ud68c\uadc0 \ubd84\uc11d\uae30\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ubc84\ub9ac\uba70, \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc5c6\ub294 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc740 \uc790\uc6d0\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc7a5\uce58\uc5d0\uc11c \uacfc\uc5f4 \uc704\ud5d8\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

The proposed system coordinates autonomous charging agents across networks of 250 EVs and 45 charging stations while adapting to dynamic environmental conditions through context-aware decision-making. Our multi-agent approach employs coordinated Deep Q\\-Networks integrated with Graph Neural Networks and attention mechanisms, processing 20 contextual features including weather patterns, traffic conditions, grid load fluctuations, and electricity pricing.The framework balances five ecosystem stakeholders i.e. EV users (25\\%), grid operators (20\\%), charging station operators (20\\%), fleet operators (20%), and environmental factors (15\\%) through weighted coordination mechanisms and consensus protocols. Comprehensive validation using real-world datasets containing 441,077 charging transactions demonstrates superior performance compared to baseline algorithms including DDPG, A3C, PPO, and GNN approaches. The CAMAC\\-DRA framework achieves 92\\% coordination success rate, 15\\% energy efficiency improvement, 10\\% cost reduction, 20% grid strain decrease, and \\2.3x faster convergence while maintaining 88\\% training stability and 85\\% sample efficiency. Real-world validation confirms commercial viability with Net Present Cost of -\\$122,962 and 69\\% cost reduction through renewable energy integration.

Code is available at https://github.com/ShanechiLab/CrossModalDistillation", "summary": "Local field potentials (LFPs) can be routinely recorded alongside spiking activity in intracortical neural experiments, measure a larger complementary spatiotemporal scale of brain activity for scientific inquiry, and can offer practical advantages over spikes, including greater long-term stability, robustness to electrode degradation, and lower power requirements. Despite these advantages, recent neural modeling frameworks have largely focused on spiking activity since LFP signals pose inherent modeling challenges due to their aggregate, population-level nature, often leading to lower predictive power for downstream task variables such as motor behavior. To address this challenge, we introduce a cross-modal knowledge distillation framework that transfers high-fidelity representational knowledge from pretrained multi-session spike transformer models to LFP transformer models. Specifically, we first train a teacher spike model across multiple recording sessions using a masked autoencoding objective with a session-specific neural tokenization strategy. We then align the latent representations of the student LFP model to those of the teacher spike model. Our results show that the Distilled LFP models consistently outperform single- and multi-session LFP baselines in both fully unsupervised and supervised settings, and can generalize to other sessions without additional distillation while maintaining superior performance. These findings demonstrate that cross-modal knowledge distillation is a powerful and scalable approach for leveraging high-performing spike models to develop more accurate LFP models.", "AI": {"tldr":

We propose The Forecast Critic, a system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated forecast monitoring, taking advantage of their broad world knowledge and strong ``reasoning'' capabilities. As a prerequisite for this, we systematically evaluate the ability of LLMs to assess time series forecast quality, focusing on three key questions. (1) Can LLMs be deployed to perform forecast monitoring and identify obviously unreasonable forecasts? (2) Can LLMs effectively incorporate unstructured exogenous features to assess what a reasonable forecast looks like? (3) How does performance vary across model sizes and reasoning capabilities, measured across state-of-the-art LLMs? We present three experiments, including on both synthetic and real-world forecasting data. Our results show that LLMs can reliably detect and critique poor forecasts, such as those plagued by temporal misalignment, trend inconsistencies, and spike errors. The best-performing model we evaluated achieves an F1 score of 0.88, somewhat below human-level performance (F1 score: 0.97). We also demonstrate that multi-modal LLMs can effectively incorporate unstructured contextual signals to refine their assessment of the forecast. Models correctly identify missing or spurious promotional spikes when provided with historical context about past promotions (F1 score: 0.84). Lastly, we demonstrate that these techniques succeed in identifying inaccurate forecasts on the real-world M5 time series dataset, with unreasonable forecasts having an sCRPS at least 10% higher than that of reasonable forecasts. These findings suggest that LLMs, even without domain-specific fine-tuning, may provide a viable and scalable option for automated forecast monitoring and evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc18c\ub9e4\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc608\uce21 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\uc740 \uace0\uac1d \ub9cc\uc871, \uc218\uc775\uc131 \ubc0f \uc6b4\uc601 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc5d0 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9 \uc608\uce21 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc778 'The Forecast Critic'\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

We introduce Error-Free Linear Attention (EFLA), a numerically stable, fully parallelism and generalized formulation of the delta rule. Specifically, we formulate the online learning update as a continuous-time dynamical system and prove that its exact solution is not only attainable but also computable in linear time with full parallelism. By leveraging the rank-1 structure of the dynamics matrix, we directly derive the exact closed-form solution effectively corresponding to the infinite-order Runge-Kutta method. This attention mechanism is theoretically free from error accumulation, perfectly capturing the continuous dynamics while preserving the linear-time complexity. Through an extensive suite of experiments, we show that EFLA enables robust performance in noisy environments, achieving lower language modeling perplexity and superior downstream benchmark performance than DeltaNet without introducing additional parameters.

One of the critical research focus is the selection of prompt demonstrations. Current approaches typically employ retrieval models to select the top-K most semantically similar examples as demonstrations. However, we argue that existing methods are limited since the label consistency is not guaranteed during demonstration selection. Our cognition derives from the Bayesian view of ICL and our rethinking of ICL from the transductive label propagation perspective. We treat ICL as a transductive learning method and incorporate latent concepts from Bayesian view and deduce that similar demonstrations guide the concepts of query, with consistent labels serving as estimates. Based on this understanding, we establish a label propagation framework to link label consistency with propagation error bounds. To model label consistency, we propose a data synthesis method, leveraging both semantic and label information, and use TopK sampling with Synthetic Data (TopK-SD) to acquire demonstrations with consistent labels. TopK-SD outperforms original TopK sampling on multiple benchmarks.

Overlooking this phenomenon, known as concept drift, can substantially degrade the predictive performance of the model. Furthermore, the presence of hyperparameters in online models exacerbates this issue, as these parameters are typically fixed and lack the flexibility to dynamically adjust to evolving data. This paper introduces \"OLR-WAA: An Adaptive and Drift-Resilient Online Regression with Dynamic Weighted Average\", a hyperparameter-free model designed to tackle the challenges of non-stationary data streams and enable effective, continuous adaptation. The objective is to strike a balance between model stability and adaptability. OLR-WAA incrementally updates its base model by integrating incoming data streams, utilizing an exponentially weighted moving average. It further introduces a unique optimization mechanism that dynamically detects concept drift, quantifies its magnitude, and adjusts the model based on real-time data characteristics. Rigorous evaluations show that it matches batch regression performance in static settings and consistently outperforms or rivals state-of-the-art online models, confirming its effectiveness. Concept drift datasets reveal a performance gap that OLR-WAA effectively bridges, setting it apart from other online models. In addition, the model effectively handles confidence-based scenarios through a conservative update strategy that prioritizes stable, high-confidence data points.

We test the robustness of these claims. First, we reproduce Anthropic's multi-turn \"emergent introspection\" result on Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, finding that the model identifies and names the injected concept 20 percent of the time under Anthropic's original pipeline, exactly matching their reported numbers and thus showing that introspection is not exclusive to very large or capable models. Second, we systematically vary the inference prompt and find that introspection is fragile: performance collapses on closely related tasks such as multiple-choice identification of the injected concept or different prompts of binary discrimination of whether a concept was injected at all. Third, we identify a contrasting regime of partial introspection: the same model can reliably classify the strength of the coefficient of a normalized injected concept vector (as weak / moderate / strong / very strong) with up to 70 percent accuracy, far above the 25 percent chance baseline. Together, these results provide more evidence for Anthropic's claim that language models effectively compute a function of their baseline, internal representations during introspection; however, these self-reports about those representations are narrow and prompt-sensitive.

Additionally, in the realm of Online Learning, ensuring statistical significance is essential to validate continuous learning processes, particularly for achieving rapid convergence and effectively managing concept drifts in a timely manner. Robust statistical methods are needed to assess the significance of performance differences as data evolves over time. This article examines the state-of-the-art online regression models and empirically evaluates several suitable tests. To compare multiple online regression models across various datasets, we employed the Friedman test along with corresponding post-hoc tests. For thorough evaluations, utilizing both real and synthetic datasets with 5-fold cross-validation and seed averaging ensures comprehensive assessment across various data subsets. Our tests generally confirmed the performance of competitive baselines as consistent with their individual reports. However, some statistical test results also indicate that there is still room for improvement in certain aspects of state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c

We analyzed documentation from five frontier models (Gemini 3, Grok 4.1, Llama 4, GPT-5, and Claude 4.5) and 100 Hugging Face model cards, identifying 947 unique section names with extreme naming variation. Usage information alone appeared under 97 distinct labels. Using the EU AI Act Annex IV and the Stanford Transparency Index as baselines, we developed a weighted transparency framework with 8 sections and 23 subsections that prioritizes safety-critical disclosures (Safety Evaluation: 25%, Critical Risk: 20%) over technical specifications. We implemented an automated multi-agent pipeline that extracts documentation from public sources and scores completeness through LLM-based consensus.

We consider a setting in which a model provider distributes trained models to multiple clients whose devices support local inference but lack the ability to retrain those models, placing the burden of performance maintenance on the provider. We introduce a model-agnostic framework that captures the interaction between resource allocation, concept drift dynamics, and deployment timing. We show that optimal training policies depend critically on the aging properties of concept durations. Under sudden concept changes, we derive optimal training policies subject to budget constraints when concept durations follow distributions with Decreasing Mean Residual Life (DMRL), and show that intuitive heuristics are provably suboptimal under Increasing Mean Residual Life (IMRL). We further study model deployment under communication constraints, prove that the associated optimization problem is quasi-convex under mild conditions, and propose a randomized scheduling strategy that achieves near-optimal client-side performance. These results offer theoretical and algorithmic foundations for cost-efficient ML model management under concept drift, with implications for continual learning, distributed inference, and adaptive ML

Aesthetic concepts are inherently abstract and open-ended, and multimodal artwork annotations are scarce. We introduce KidsArtBench, a new benchmark of over 1k children's artworks (ages 5-15) annotated by 12 expert educators across 9 rubric-aligned dimensions, together with expert comments for feedback. Unlike prior aesthetic datasets that provide single scalar scores on adult imagery, KidsArtBench targets children's artwork and pairs multi-dimensional annotations with comment supervision to enable both ordinal assessment and formative feedback. Building on this resource, we propose an attribute-specific multi-LoRA approach, where each attribute corresponds to a distinct evaluation dimension (e.g., Realism, Imagination) in the scoring rubric, with Regression-Aware Fine-Tuning (RAFT) to align predictions with ordinal scales. On Qwen2.5-VL-7B, our method increases correlation from 0.468 to 0.653, with the largest gains on perceptual dimensions and narrowed gaps on higher-order attributes. These results show that educator-aligned supervision and attribute-aware training yield pedagogically meaningful evaluations and establish a rigorous testbed for sustained progress in educational AI.

This research develops a framework for network level evaluation of hangup susceptibility of HRGCs. Profile data from different crossings in Oklahoma were collected using both a walking profiler and the Pave3D8K Laser Imaging System. A hybrid deep learning model, combining Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Transformer architectures, was developed to reconstruct accurate HRGC profiles from Pave3D8K Laser Imaging System data. Vehicle dimension data from around 350 specialty vehicles were collected at various locations across Oklahoma to enable up to date statistical design dimensions. Hangup susceptibility was analyzed using three vehicle dimension scenarios (a) median dimension (median wheelbase and ground clearance), (b) 75 25 percentile dimension (75 percentile wheelbase, 25 percentile ground clearance), and (c) worst case dimension (maximum wheelbase and minimum ground clearance). Results indicate 36, 62, and 67 crossings at the highest hangup risk levels under these scenarios, respectively.

The Marginal Value Theorem (MVT) is frequently used to characterize this process, offering an optimality model for such foraging behaviors. Although this model has been widely used to make predictions in behavioral ecology, discovering the computational mechanisms that facilitate the emergence of optimal patch-foraging decisions in biological foragers remains under investigation. Here, we show that artificial foragers equipped with learned world models naturally converge to MVT-aligned strategies. Using a model-based reinforcement learning agent that acquires a parsimonious predictive representation of its environment, we demonstrate that anticipatory capabilities, rather than reward maximization alone, drive efficient patch-leaving behavior. Compared with standard model-free RL agents, these model-based agents exhibit decision patterns similar to many of their biological counterparts, suggesting that predictive world models can serve as a foundation for more explainable and biologically grounded decision-making in AI systems.

Learning accurate switching dynamical system models can reveal how behavior is encoded in neural activity. Existing switching approaches have primarily focused on learning models from a single neural modality, either continuous Gaussian signals or discrete Poisson signals. However, multiple neural modalities are often recorded simultaneously to measure different spatiotemporal scales of brain activity, and all these modalities can encode behavior. Moreover, regime labels are typically unavailable in training data, posing a significant challenge for learning models of regime-dependent switching dynamics. To address these challenges, we develop a novel unsupervised learning algorithm that learns the parameters of switching multiscale dynamical system models using only multiscale neural observations. We demonstrate our method using both simulations and two distinct experimental datasets with multimodal spike-LFP observations during different motor tasks. We find that our switching multiscale dynamical system models more accurately decode behavior than switching single-scale dynamical models, showing the success of multiscale neural fusion. Further, our models outperform stationary multiscale models, illustrating the importance of tracking regime-dependent non-stationarity in multimodal neural data. The developed unsupervised learning framework enables more accurate modeling of complex multiscale neural dynamics by leveraging information in multimodal recordings while incorporating regime switches. This approach holds promise for improving the performance and robustness of brain-computer interfaces over time and for advancing our understanding of the neural basis of behavior.", "AI": {"tldr":

No existing XAI methods address tool-level explanations. We introduce AgentSHAP, the first framework for explaining tool importance in LLM agents. AgentSHAP is model-agnostic: it treats the agent as a black box and works with any LLM (GPT, Claude, Llama, etc.) without needing access to internal weights or gradients. Using Monte Carlo Shapley values, AgentSHAP tests how an agent responds with different tool subsets and computes fair importance scores based on game theory. Our contributions are: (1) the first explainability method for agent tool attribution, grounded in Shapley values from game theory; (2) Monte Carlo sampling that reduces cost from O(2n) to practical levels; and (3) comprehensive experiments on API-Bank showing that AgentSHAP produces consistent scores across runs, correctly identifies which tools matter, and distinguishes relevant from irrelevant tools. AgentSHAP joins TokenSHAP (for tokens) and PixelSHAP (for image regions) to complete a family of Shapley-based XAI tools for modern generative AI.

The framework formalizes the ETL scheduling process as a Markov Decision Process and enables adaptive decision-making by a reinforcement learning agent in high-dimensional state spaces to dynamically optimize task allocation and resource scheduling. The model consists of a state representation module, a feature embedding network, a Q-value estimator, and a reward evaluation mechanism, which collectively consider task dependencies, node load states, and data flow characteristics to derive the optimal scheduling strategy in complex environments. A multi-objective reward function is designed to balance key performance indicators such as average scheduling delay, task completion rate, throughput, and resource utilization. Sensitivity experiments further verify the model's robustness under changes in hyperparameters, environmental dynamics, and data scale. Experimental results show that the proposed deep Q-learning scheduling framework significantly reduces scheduling delay, improves system throughput, and enhances execution stability under multi-source heterogeneous task conditions, demonstrating the strong potential of reinforcement learning in complex data scheduling and resource management, and providing an efficient and scalable optimization strategy for intelligent data pipeline construction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc774\uc885 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c ETL \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\uc758

However, current evaluation practices for GUI agents face two fundamental limitations. First, they either rely on single path offline benchmarks or online live benchmarks. Offline benchmarks using static, single path annotated datasets unfairly penalize valid alternative actions, while online benchmarks suffer from poor scalability and reproducibility due to the dynamic and unpredictable nature of live evaluation. Second, existing benchmarks treat agents as monolithic black boxes, overlooking the contributions of individual components, which often leads to unfair comparisons or obscures key performance bottlenecks. To address these limitations, we present MobiBench, the first modular and multi path aware offline benchmarking framework for mobile GUI agents that enables high fidelity, scalable, and reproducible evaluation entirely in offline settings. Our experiments demonstrate that MobiBench achieves 94.72 percent agreement with human evaluators, on par with carefully engineered online benchmarks, while preserving the scalability and reproducibility of static offline benchmarks. Furthermore, our comprehensive module level analysis uncovers several key insights, including a systematic evaluation of diverse techniques used in mobile GUI agents, optimal module configurations across model scales, the inherent limitations of current LFMs, and actionable guidelines for designing more capable and cost efficient mobile agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "MobiBench\ub294 \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c GUI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \ubaa8\ub4c8\ud615 \ubc0f \ub2e4\uc911 \uacbd\ub85c \uc778\uc2dd \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud0b9 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \ub192\uc740 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131, \ud655\uc7a5\uc131 \ubc0f \uc7ac\ud604 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c GUI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "\ubaa8\ub4c8\ud615 \ubc0f \ub2e4\uc911 \uacbd\ub85c \uc778\uc2dd \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud0b9 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 MobiBench\ub97c \uc81c\uc548.", "result": "MobiBench\ub294 \uc778\uac04 \ud3c9\uac00\uc790\uc640 94.72%\uc758 \uc77c\uce58\ub97c \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, \uae30\uc874 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc640 \ub3d9\ub4f1\ud55c \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \uac70\ub450\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "MobiBench\ub294 \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c GUI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c GUI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\ub97c \ub300\uc2e0\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uacfc \uc0c1\ud638 \uc791\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \uc778\uac04-\ucef4\ud4e8\ud130 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ubcc0\ud654\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ud604\uc7ac GUI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00 \uad00\ud589\uc740 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ud55c\uacc4\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uccab\uc9f8, \uc774\ub4e4\uc740 \ub2e8\uc77c \uacbd\ub85c \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ub610\ub294 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub294 \uc815\uc801\uc774\uba70 \ub2e8\uc77c \uacbd\ub85c\ub85c \uc8fc\uc11d\uc774 \ub2ec\ub9b0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc720\ud6a8\ud55c \ub300\uc548 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubd88\uacf5\uc815\ud558\uac8c \ucc98\ubc8c\ud558\uba70, \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub294 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \ud3c9\uac00\uc758 \ub3d9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc608\uce21\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \ud2b9\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc88b\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uacfc \uc7ac\ud604\uc131\uc5d0 \uc2dc\ub2ec\ub9bd\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub458\uc9f8, \uae30\uc874 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ub2e8\uc77c\ud55c \ube14\ub799 \ubc15\uc2a4\ub85c \ucde8\uae09\ud558\uc5ec \uac1c\ubcc4 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\uc758 \uae30\uc5ec\ub97c \uac04\uacfc\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub294 \uc885\uc885 \ubd88\uacf5\uc815\ud55c \ube44\uad50\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc131\ub2a5 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \uac00\ub9bd\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c GUI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \ubaa8\ub4c8\ud615 \ubc0f \ub2e4\uc911 \uacbd\ub85c \uc778\uc2dd \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud0b9 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 MobiBench\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

To alleviate this problem, recent work has explored unsupervised RLVR methods that derive rewards solely from the model's internal consistency, such as through entropy and majority voting. While seemingly promising, these methods often suffer from model collapse in the later stages of training, which may arise from the reinforcement of incorrect reasoning patterns in the absence of external supervision. In this work, we investigate a novel semi-supervised RLVR paradigm that utilizes a small labeled set to guide RLVR training on unlabeled samples. Our key insight is that supervised rewards are essential for stabilizing consistency-based training on unlabeled samples, ensuring that only reasoning patterns verified on labeled instances are incorporated into RL training. Technically, we propose an effective policy optimization algorithm, TraPO, that identifies reliable unlabeled samples by matching their learning trajectory similarity to labeled ones. Building on this, TraPO achieves remarkable data efficiency and strong generalization on six widely used mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AIME24/25, AMC, MATH-500, Minerva, and Olympiad) and three out-of-distribution tasks (ARC-c, GPQA-diamond, and MMLU-pro). With only 1K labeled and 3K unlabeled samples, TraPO reaches 42.6% average accuracy, surpassing the best unsupervised method trained on 45K unlabeled samples (38.3%). Notably, when using 4K labeled and 12K unlabeled samples, TraPO even outperforms the fully supervised model trained on the full 45K labeled samples on all benchmarks, while using only 10% of the labeled data.

Our study focuses on masked feature reconstruction (MFR), a generative technique where a model learns to restore the raw features of masked nodes in a self-supervised manner. We observe that both MFR and graph contrastive learning (GCL) aim to maximize agreement between similar elements. Building on this observation, we reveal a novel theoretical insight: under specific conditions, the objectives of MFR and node-level GCL converge, despite their distinct operational mechanisms. This theoretical connection suggests these approaches are complementary rather than fundamentally different, prompting us to explore their integration to enhance self-supervised learning on graphs. Our research presents Contrastive Masked Feature Reconstruction (CORE), a novel graph self-supervised learning framework that integrates contrastive learning into MFR. Specifically, we form positive pairs exclusively between the original and reconstructed features of masked nodes, encouraging the encoder to prioritize contextual information over the node's own features. Additionally, we leverage the masked nodes themselves as negative samples, combining MFR's reconstructive power with GCL's discriminative ability to better capture intrinsic graph structures. Empirically, our proposed framework CORE significantly outperforms MFR across node and graph classification tasks, demonstrating state-of-the-art results. In particular, CORE surpasses GraphMAE and GraphMAE2 by up to 2.80% and 3.72% on node classification tasks, and by up to 3.82% and 3.76% on graph classification tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc0dd\uc131\uc801 \uae30\uc220\uc778 \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud06c \ud2b9\uc9d5 \ubcf5\uc6d0(MFR)\uacfc \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ub300\uc870 \ud559\uc2b5(GCL)\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc790\uae30 \uc9c0\ub3c4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 \ub300\uc870 \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud06c \ud2b9\uc9d5 \ubcf5\uc6d0(CORE)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, CORE\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubd84\ub958 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc758 \uc790\uae30 \uc9c0\ub3c4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0dd\uc131\uc801 \ubc0f \ub300\uc870\uc801 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc774 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \ubd80\uc0c1\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub4e4 \uac04\uc758 \ud1b5\ud569 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub9c8\uc2a4\ud06c\ub41c \ub178\ub4dc\uc758 \uc6d0\ubcf8 \ubc0f \ubcf5\uc6d0\ub41c \ud2b9\uc9d5 \uac04\uc5d0 \uae0d\uc815 \uc30d\uc744 \ud615\uc131\ud558\uace0, \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud06c\ub41c \ub178\ub4dc \uc790\uccb4\ub97c \ubd80\uc815 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec MFR\uc758 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131 \ub2a5\ub825\uacfc GCL\uc758 \ucc28\ubcc4 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \ub300\uc870 \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud06c \ud2b9\uc9d5 \ubcf5\uc6d0(CORE) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "CORE\ub294 \ub178\ub4dc \ubc0f \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ubd84\ub958 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c MFR\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc720\uc758\ubbf8\ud558\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub41c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, GraphMAE \ubc0f GraphMAE2\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ub178\ub4dc \ubd84\ub958 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uac01\uac01 \ucd5c\ub300 2.80% \ubc0f 3.72%, \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ubd84\ub958 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ucd5c\ub300 3.82% \ubc0f 3.76%\uc758 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \uae30\ub85d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "MFR\uacfc GCL\uc758 \ud1b5\ud569\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc790\uae30 \uc9c0\ub3c4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 CORE \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ub354 \uc798 \ucea1\ucc98\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac1c\uc120\ub41c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc758 \uc790\uae30 \uc9c0\ub3c4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0dd\uc131\uc801 \ubc0f \ub300\uc870\uc801 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc774 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\ub41c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \ubd80\uc0c1\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc790\uae30 \uc9c0\ub3c4 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud06c\ub41c \ub178\ub4dc\uc758 \uc6d0\ubcf8 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \ubcf5\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \uc0dd\uc131\uc801 \uae30\uc220\uc778 \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud06c \ud2b9\uc9d5 \ubcf5\uc6d0(MFR)\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.

Agentic memory refers to the memory that provides an LLM with agent-like persistence: the ability to retain and act upon information across conversations, similar to how a human would. We present Memoria, a modular memory framework that augments LLM-based conversational systems with persistent, interpretable, and context-rich memory. Memoria integrates two complementary components: dynamic session-level summarization and a weighted knowledge graph (KG)-based user modelling engine that incrementally captures user traits, preferences, and behavioral patterns as structured entities and relationships. This hybrid architecture enables both short-term dialogue coherence and long-term personalization while operating within the token constraints of modern LLMs. We demonstrate how Memoria enables scalable, personalized conversational artificial intelligence (AI) by bridging the gap between stateless LLM interfaces and agentic memory systems, offering a practical solution for industry applications requiring adaptive and evolving user experiences.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc774 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c0\uc18d\uc131\uacfc \uac1c\uc778\ud654, \uc7a5\uae30\uc801\uc778 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc694\uc18c\ub85c \ub5a0\uc624\ub974\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 Memoria\ub77c\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc2dd \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ub300\ud654 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uba70 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc774 \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\ub97c \ucd94\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\ub294 LLM\uc774 \uc9c4\uc815\ud55c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud615 \ubc0f \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \ubc30\uce58\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \ud575\uc2ec \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "Memoria\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc138\uc158 \uc218\uc900 \uc694\uc57d \ubc0f \uac00\uc911 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uadf8\ub798\ud504(KG) \uae30\ubc18 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \uc5d4\uc9c4\uc758 \ud1b5\ud569\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub418\uc5b4, \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ud2b9\uc131, \uc120\ud638 \ubc0f \ud589\ub3d9 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc5d4\ud2f0\ud2f0\uc640 \uad00\uacc4\ub85c \uc810\uc9c4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucea1\ucc98\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774 \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub294 \ud604\ub300 LLM\uc758 \ud1a0\ud070 \uc81c\uc57d \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e8\uae30 \ub300\ud654 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uacfc \uc7a5\uae30 \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Memoria\ub294 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uac00 \uc5c6\ub294 LLM \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\uc640 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc0ac\uc774\uc758 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uc18c\ud558\uc5ec \uc0b0\uc5c5 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ubc0f \ubc1c\uc804\ud558\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc774 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc131, \uac1c\uc778\ud654 \ubc0f \uc7a5\uae30 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc694\uc18c\ub85c \ub5a0\uc624\ub974\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 LLM\uc744 \uc9c4\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc801\uc751\ud615\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \ubc30\uce58\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc778 \uae30\ub2a5\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\ub294 LLM\uc774 \uc778\uac04\ucc98\ub7fc \ub300\ud654 \uac04 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud574\uc8fc\ub294 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\ub97c \uc758\ubbf8\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uba70 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc774 \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\ub85c LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ub300\ud654 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ubcf4\uac15\ud558\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4c8\ud615 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Memoria\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

As large language models (LLMs) become widely used, managing risks arising from insufficient forgetting or utility loss is increasingly crucial. Current MU techniques lack effective mechanisms for evaluating and controlling these risks, hindering the selection of strategies that appropriately balance safety and utility, and raising trust concerns surrounding the \"right to be forgotten.\" To address these issues, we propose FROC, a unified framework with Risk-Optimized Control for machine unlearning in LLMs. FROC is built around a conformal-style risk-control formulation that expresses a user-specified risk budget on unlearning behavior. This probability-based constraint enables FROC to compare MU strategies, identify feasible operating regions, and guide hyperparameter selection according to desired trade-offs between forgetting sufficiency and utility preservation. To operationalize this constraint, FROC introduces a smoothly varying continuous risk model that aggregates forgetting deficiency and utility degradation into a single configuration-level score. Building on conformal risk analysis, FROC computes (1) the Conformal Unlearning Risk (CUR), a data-driven estimated value on the probability that forgotten samples continue to influence model predictions, and (2) risk-controlled configuration sets, which identify unlearning hyperparameters that are valid under the specified risk budget. Experiments across multiple LLM MU methods demonstrate that FROC produces stable, interpretable risk landscapes and reveals consistent relationships between unlearning configurations, semantic shift, and utility impact.

Project page: https://kagnlp.github.io/WebOperator/", "summary": "LLM-based agents often operate in a greedy, step-by-step manner, selecting actions solely based on the current observation without considering long-term consequences or alternative paths. This lack of foresight is particularly problematic in web environments, which are only partially observable-limited to browser-visible content (e.g., DOM and UI elements)-where a single misstep often requires complex and brittle navigation to undo. Without an explicit backtracking mechanism, agents struggle to correct errors or systematically explore alternative paths. Tree-search methods provide a principled framework for such structured exploration, but existing approaches lack mechanisms for safe backtracking, making them prone to unintended side effects. They also assume that all actions are reversible, ignoring the presence of irreversible actions-limitations that reduce their effectiveness in realistic web tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce WebOperator, a tree-search framework that enables reliable backtracking and strategic exploration. Our method incorporates a best-first search strategy that ranks actions by both reward estimates and safety considerations, along with a robust backtracking mechanism that verifies the feasibility of previously visited paths before replaying them, preventing unintended side effects. To further guide exploration, WebOperator generates action candidates from multiple, varied reasoning contexts to ensure diverse and robust exploration, and subsequently curates a high-quality action set by filtering out invalid actions pre-execution and merging semantically equivalent ones. Experimental results on WebArena and WebVoyager demonstrate the effectiveness of WebOperator. On WebArena, WebOperator achieves a state-of-the-art 54.6% success rate with gpt-4o, underscoring the critical advantage of integrating strategic foresight with safe execution.", "AI": {"tldr":

However, high computational demands, complex incentive mechanisms, and disparities in client-side computing power often lead to long times and higher costs. To address these challenges, many existing methods rely on server-side knowledge distillation that solely removes the updates of the target client, overlooking the privacy embedded in the contributions of other clients, which can lead to privacy leakage. In this work, we introduce DPUL, a novel server-side unlearning method that deeply unlearns all influential weights to prevent privacy pitfalls. Our approach comprises three components: (i) identifying high-weight parameters by filtering client update magnitudes, and rolling them back to ensure deep removal. (ii) leveraging the variational autoencoder (VAE) to reconstruct and eliminate low-weight parameters. (iii) utilizing a projection-based technique to recover the model. Experimental results on four datasets demonstrate that DPUL surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, providing a 1%-5% improvement in accuracy and up to 12x reduction in time cost.", "AI": {"tldr":

In response, automated game testing has been viewed as a promising solution to cope with this demanding release cadence. However, existing automated testing approaches typically create a dichotomy: code-centric methods focus on structural coverage without understanding gameplay context, while player-centric agents validate high-level intent but often fail to cover specific underlying code changes. To bridge this gap, we propose SMART (Structural Mapping for Augmented Reinforcement Testing), a novel framework that synergizes structural verification and functional validation for game update testing. SMART leverages large language models (LLMs) to interpret abstract syntax tree (AST) differences and extract functional intent, constructing a context-aware hybrid reward mechanism. This mechanism guides reinforcement learning agents to sequentially fulfill gameplay goals while adaptively exploring modified code branches. We evaluate SMART on two environments, Overcooked and Minecraft. The results demonstrate that SMART significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines; it achieves over 94% branch coverage of modified code, nearly double that of traditional reinforcement learning methods, while maintaining a 98% task completion rate, effectively balancing structural comprehensiveness with functional correctness.", "AI": {"tldr": "SMART\ub294 \uac8c\uc784 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uac80\uc99d\uacfc \uae30\ub2a5\uc801 \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uac8c\uc784 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc758 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \ub192\uc778\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uac8c\uc784 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ube48\ubc88\ud55c \ucf58\ud150\uce20 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud574\uc9d0\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ud488\uc9c8 \ubcf4\uc99d\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc555\ubc15\uc774 \ucee4\uc84c\ub2e4.", "method": "SMART\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ucd94\uc0c1 \uad6c\ubb38 \ud2b8\ub9ac \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \ud574\uc11d\ud558\uace0 \uae30\ub2a5\uc801 \uc758\ub3c4\ub97c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub9e5\ub77d \uc778\uc9c0\ud615 \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "SMART\ub294 Overcooked\uc640 Minecraft \ub450 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uc218\uc815\ub41c \ucf54\ub4dc\uc758 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub36e\uac1c\uc5d0\uc11c 94% \uc774\uc0c1\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \uac70\uc758 \ub450 \ubc30\uc5d0 \ub2ec\ud558\ub294 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "SMART\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ud3ec\uad04\uc131\uacfc \uae30\ub2a5\uc801 \uc815\ud655\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uace0\uc720\ud55c \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uac8c\uc784 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc758 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \ub192\uc778\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\"\uac8c\uc784 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\" \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \ucc44\ud0dd\uc740 \ube48\ubc88\ud55c \ucf58\ud150\uce20 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud558\uc5ec \ud488\uc9c8 \ubcf4\uc99d\uc5d0 \uc5c4\uccad\ub09c \uc555\ubc15\uc744 \uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uac8c\uc784 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc694\uad6c\ub418\ub294 \ubc30\ud3ec \uc8fc\uae30\uc5d0 \ub300\ucc98\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\uace0\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\ubd84\ubc95\uc744 \ub9cc\ub4e4\uc5b4 \ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4: \ucf54\ub4dc \uc911\uc2ec \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uac8c\uc784 \ud50c\ub808\uc774 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c \ucc44 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ubc94\uc704\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\ub294 \ubc18\uba74, \ud50c\ub808\uc774\uc5b4 \uc911\uc2ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uace0\uc218\uc900 \uc758\ub3c4\ub97c \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ud2b9\uc815 \uae30\ubc18 \ucf54\ub4dc \ubcc0\uacbd \uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \ucee4\ubc84\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uc18c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac8c\uc784 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uac80\uc99d\uacfc \uae30\ub2a5\uc801 \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \uc2dc\ub108\uc9c0\ub97c \uc774\ub8e8\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 SMART(\uad6c\uc870 \ub9e4\ud551\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Such agents could intentionally sabotage these codebases if they were misaligned. We investigate asynchronous monitoring, in which a monitoring system reviews agent actions after the fact. Unlike synchronous monitoring, this approach does not impose runtime latency, while still attempting to disrupt attacks before irreversible harm occurs. We treat monitor development as an adversarial game between a blue team (who design monitors) and a red team (who create sabotaging agents). We attempt to set the game rules such that they upper bound the sabotage potential of an agent based on Claude 4.1 Opus. To ground this game in a realistic, high-stakes deployment scenario, we develop a suite of 5 diverse software engineering environments that simulate tasks that an agent might perform within an AI developer's internal infrastructure. Over the course of the game, we develop an ensemble monitor that achieves a 6% false negative rate at 1% false positive rate on a held out test environment. Then, we estimate risk of sabotage at deployment time by extrapolating from our monitor's false negative rate. We describe one simple model for this extrapolation, present a sensitivity analysis, and describe situations in which the model would be invalid.

Existing commercial solutions often prioritize interactive user safety, enforcing authentication barriers that break the headless loops required for true autonomy. This paper presents a Fault-Tolerant Sandboxing framework designed to mitigate these risks through a policy-based interception layer and a transactional filesystem snapshot mechanism. We hypothesize that wrapping agent actions in atomic transactions can guarantee safety with acceptable latency, outperforming the heavy initialization overhead of containers or the interactive friction of commercial CLIs. We validated this approach by deploying the Minimind-MoE LLM served via nano-vllm on a custom Proxmox-based testbed utilizing EVPN/VXLAN isolation. Experimental results demonstrate a 100\\% interception rate for high-risk commands and a 100\\% success rate in rolling back failed states. Crucially, our prototype incurs only a 14.5\\% performance overhead (approx. 1.8s) per transaction. In contrast, benchmarking against the Gemini CLI sandbox revealed that it requires interactive authentication (\"Sign in\"), rendering it unusable for headless, autonomous agent workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774\ubc88 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc804\ud658\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc548\uc804 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uace0\uc7a5 \ud5c8\uc6a9 \uc0cc\ub4dc\ubc15\uc2a4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \uc804\ud658\ub428\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ud30c\uad34\uc801\uc778 \uba85\ub839\uacfc \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc548\uc804 \uc704\ud5d8\uc774 \ucee4\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc815\ucc45 \uae30\ubc18 \uc778\ud130\uc149\uc158 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\uc640 \ud2b8\ub79c\uc7ad\uc154\ub110 \ud30c\uc77c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc2a4\ub0c5\uc0f7 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \uace0\uc7a5 \ud5c8\uc6a9 \uc0cc\ub4dc\ubc15\uc2a4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548.", "result": "Minimind-MoE LLM\uc744 \ucee4\uc2a4\ud140 Proxmox \uae30\ubc18 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc30\ud3ec\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \uc9c4\ud589\ud588\uace0, \uc704\ud5d8 \ub192\uc740 \uba85\ub839\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c 100% \uc778\ud130\uc149\uc158\uc728\uacfc \uc2e4\ud328\ud55c \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \ub864\ubc31\ud558\ub294 100% \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ud0c0\uc785\uc740 \uac70\ub798\ub2f9 14.5%\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub9cc \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uba70(\uc57d 1.8\ucd08), Gemini CLI \uc0cc\ub4dc\ubc15\uc2a4\uc640 \ube44\uad50\ud588\uc744 \ub54c \uc0c1\ud638 \uc778\uc99d\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uc5ec \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\uc6a9 \ubd88\uac00\ub2a5\ud558\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \uc218\ub3d9 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131\uae30\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c\uc758 \uc804\ud658\uc740 \ud30c\uad34\uc801\uc778 \uba85\ub839\uacfc \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc640 \uad00\ub828\ud558\uc5ec \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc548\uc804 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \uc0c1\uc5c5\uc801 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc548\uc804\uc744 \uc6b0\uc120\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \uc9c4\uc815\ud55c \uc790\uc728\uc131\uc5d0 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ud5e4\ub4dc\ub9ac\uc2a4 \ub8e8\ud504\ub97c \uae68\ub294 \uc778\uc99d \uc7a5\ubcbd\uc744 \uac15\uc81c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc815\ucc45 \uae30\ubc18 \uc778\ud130\uc149\uc158 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\uc640 \ud2b8\ub79c\uc7ad\uc158 \ud30c\uc77c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc2a4\ub0c5\uc0f7 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uace0\uc7a5 \ud5c8\uc6a9 \uc0cc\ub4dc\ubc15\uc2a4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc6d0\uc790 \uac70\ub798\ub85c \uac10\uc2f8\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc218\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub300\uae30 \uc2dc\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \uc548\uc804\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4\uace0 \uac00\uc124\uc744 \uc138\uc6e0\uace0, \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108\uc758 \ubb34\uac70\uc6b4 \ucd08\uae30\ud654 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub098 \uc0c1\uc5c5\uc801\uc778 CLI\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ub9c8\ucc30\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud560 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \uc608\uc0c1\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 EVPN/VXLAN \uaca9\ub9ac\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec nano-vllm\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc81c\uacf5\ub418\ub294 Minimind-MoE LLM\uc744 \ucee4\uc2a4\ud140 Proxmox \uae30\ubc18 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \ubc30\ud3ec\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc704\ud5d8 \ub192\uc740 \uba85\ub839\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c 100% \uc778\ud130\uc149\uc158\ub960\uacfc \uc2e4\ud328\ud55c \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \ub864\ubc31\ud558\ub294 100% \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ud0c0\uc785\uc740 \uac70\ub798\ub2f9 14.5%\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc(\uc57d 1.8\ucd08)\ub9cc \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubc18\ub300\ub85c, Gemini CLI \uc0cc\ub4dc\ubc15\uc2a4\uc640 \ube44\uad50\ud560 \ub54c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uc778\uc99d(\u2018\ub85c\uadf8\uc778\u2019)\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ubbc0\ub85c \ud5e4\ub4dc\ub9ac\uc2a4 \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\uc5d0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Current approaches either maintain unlimited memory stores, leading to computational intractability and privacy concerns, or employ simplistic forgetting mechanisms that compromise agent coherence and functionality. This paper introduces the Memory-Aware Retention Schema (MaRS), a novel framework for human-centered memory management in generative agents, coupled with six theoretically-grounded forgetting policies that balance performance, privacy, and computational efficiency. We present the Forgetful but Faithful Agent (FiFA) benchmark, a comprehensive evaluation framework that assesses agent performance across narrative coherence, goal completion, social recall accuracy, privacy preservation, and cost efficiency. Through extensive experimentation involving 300 evaluation runs across multiple memory budgets and agent configurations, we demonstrate that our hybrid forgetting policy achieves superior performance (composite score: 0.911) while maintaining computational tractability and privacy guarantees. Our work establishes new benchmarks for memory-budgeted agent evaluation and provides practical guidelines for deploying generative agents in resource-constrained, privacy-sensitive environments. The theoretical foundations, implementation framework, and empirical results contribute to the emerging field of human-centered AI by addressing fundamental challenges in agent memory management that directly impact user trust, system scalability, and regulatory compliance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uad00\ub9ac

However, in many real-world settings, such as educational tutoring or medical assistance, relevant information is not directly available and must be actively acquired through dynamic interactions. An interactive agent would recognize its own uncertainty, ask targeted questions, and retain new knowledge efficiently. Prior work has primarily explored effective ways for a teacher to instruct the student, where the teacher identifies student gaps and provides guidance. In this work, we shift the focus to the student and investigate effective strategies to actively query the teacher in seeking useful information. Across math and coding benchmarks, where baseline student models begin with near-zero performance, we show that student-led approaches consistently yield absolute Pass@k improvements of at least 0.5 over static baselines. To improve question quality, we train students using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with guidance from either self or stronger students. We find that this guided training enables smaller models to learn how to ask better questions, further enhancing learning efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud559\uc0dd\uc774 \uad50\uc0ac\uc5d0\uac8c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c8\ubb38\ud558\uc5ec \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uac80\uc0c9\ud558\ub294 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub9ce\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uad00\ub828 \uc815\ubcf4\ub294 \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\uc73c\uba70, \ud559\uc0dd\uc740 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud68d\ub4dd\ud574\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud559\uc0dd\ub4e4\uc774 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c8\ubb38\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d DPO(Direct Preference Optimization)\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ub2dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud559\uc0dd \uc8fc\ub3c4\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \uc815\uc801 \uae30\uc900\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ucd5c\uc18c 0.5\uc758 Pass@k \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uac00\uc774\ub4dc \ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ub2dd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc791\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378\ub3c4 \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud559\uc2b5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc5b4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc774 \ub354\uc6b1 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\uc5d0 \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ub41c \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uac80\uc0c9\ud558\uc5ec \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc9c8\uc758\uc5d0 \ub300\ub2f5\ud558\ub294 \uc815\uc801 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uad50\uc721 \ud29c\ud130\ub9c1\uc774\ub098 \uc758\ub8cc \uc9c0\uc6d0\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uad00\ub828 \uc815\ubcf4\uac00 \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba70, \ub3d9\uc801 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud68d\ub4dd\ud574\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc778\ud130\ub799\ud2f0\ube0c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uc778\uc2dd\ud558\uace0, \ubaa9\ud45c \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \ud558\uba70, \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\uc9c0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc5b4\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uc804 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc8fc\ub85c \uad50\uc0ac\uac00 \ud559\uc0dd\uc744 \uac00\ub974\uce58\ub294 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uad50\uc0ac\uac00 \ud559\uc0dd\uc758 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0 \uc548\ub0b4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud559\uc0dd\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uace0 \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ucc3e\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uad50\uc0ac\uc5d0\uac8c \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c8\ubb38\ud558\ub294 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc900 \ud559\uc0dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uac70\uc758 \uc81c\ub85c \uc131\ub2a5\uc73c\ub85c \uc2dc\uc791\ud558\ub294 \uc218\ud559 \ubc0f \ucf54\ub529 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c, \ud559\uc0dd \uc8fc\ub3c4\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \uc815\uc801 \uae30\uc900\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ucd5c\uc18c 0.5\uc758 \uc808\ub300 Pass@k \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc9c8\ubb38 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc790\uae30 \ub610\ub294 \ub354 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud559\uc0dd\uc758 \uc9c0\ub3c4\ub97c \ubc1b\uc73c\uba70 DPO(Direct Preference Optimization)\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud559\uc0dd\ub4e4\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uac00\uc774\ub4dc \ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ub2dd\uc774 \uc791\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ubc30\uc6b0\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\uc5ec, \ud559\uc2b5 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub354\uc6b1 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b4\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

While recent advancements in real-world applications favor multi-agent architectures to manage complex conversational scenarios efficiently, ambiguity resolution remains a critical and underexplored challenge--particularly due to the difficulty of determining which agent should initiate a clarification and how agents should coordinate their actions when faced with uncertain or incomplete user input. The fundamental questions of when to interrupt a user and how to formulate the optimal clarification query within the most optimal multi-agent settings remain open. In this paper, we propose MAC (Multi-Agent Clarification), an interactive multi-agent framework specifically optimized to resolve user ambiguities by strategically managing clarification dialogues. We first introduce a novel taxonomy categorizing user ambiguities to systematically guide clarification strategies. Then, we present MAC that autonomously coordinates multiple agents to interact synergistically with users. Empirical evaluations on MultiWOZ 2.4 demonstrate that enabling clarification at both levels increases task success rate 7.8\\% (54.5 to 62.3) and reduces the average number of dialogue turns (6.53 to 4.86) by eliciting all required user information up front and minimizing repetition.

Current trends in such collaborations are predominantly unidirectional, with users providing instructions or posing questions to agents, where agents respond directly without seeking necessary clarifications or confirmations. However, the evolving capabilities of these agents require more proactive engagement, where agents should dynamically participate in conversations to clarify user intents, resolve ambiguities, and adapt to changing circumstances. Existing prior work under-utilize the conversational capabilities of language models (LMs), thereby optimizing agents as better followers rather than effective speakers. In this work, we introduce SpeakRL, a reinforcement learning (RL) method that enhances agents' conversational capabilities by rewarding proactive interactions with users, such as asking right clarification questions when necessary. To support this, we curate SpeakER, a synthetic dataset that includes diverse scenarios from task-oriented dialogues, where tasks are resolved through interactive clarification questions. We present a systematic analysis of reward design for conversational proactivity and propose a principled reward formulation for teaching agents to balance asking with acting. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach achieves a 20.14% absolute improvement in task completion over base models without increasing conversation turns even surpassing even much larger proprietary models, demonstrating the promise of clarification-centric user-agent interactions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc640\uc758 \ub300\ud654\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801\uc778

However, there is currently a lack of high-quality datasets specifically designed to evaluate the ability of large multi-modal models (LMMs) to discover medical insights. In this paper, we introduce MedInsightBench, the first benchmark that comprises 332 carefully curated medical cases, each annotated with thoughtfully designed insights. This benchmark is intended to evaluate the ability of LMMs and agent frameworks to analyze multi-modal medical image data, including posing relevant questions, interpreting complex findings, and synthesizing actionable insights and recommendations. Our analysis indicates that existing LMMs exhibit limited performance on MedInsightBench, which is primarily attributed to their challenges in extracting multi-step, deep insights and the absence of medical expertise. Therefore, we propose MedInsightAgent, an automated agent framework for medical data analysis, composed of three modules: Visual Root Finder, Analytical Insight Agent, and Follow-up Question Composer. Experiments on MedInsightBench highlight pervasive challenges and demonstrate that MedInsightAgent can improve the performance of general LMMs in medical data insight discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc758\ub8cc \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf5\ud569\uc801\uc778 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uae4a\uc740 \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc744 \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ud658\uc790 \uce58\ub8cc \uac1c\uc120\uacfc \uc9c4\ub2e8 \uc815\ud655\uc131 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ud604\uc7ac \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \uc758\ub8cc \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ubaa8\ub378(LMM)\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc758 \ubd80\uc871.", "method": "332\uac1c\uc758 \uc2e0\uc911\ud558\uac8c \uc120\ubcc4\ub41c \uc758\ub8cc \uc0ac\ub840\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c MedInsightBench \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uace0, LMM\uc774 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uc758\ub8cc \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc0ac\uc6a9.", "result": "\uae30\uc874 LMM\uc774 MedInsightBench\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uae4a\uc740 \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc744 \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc774 \uc788\uace0 \uc758\ub8cc \uc804\ubb38 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc774\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "MedInsightAgent\ub77c\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 LMM \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc758\ub8cc \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uae4a\uc740 \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc744 \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ud658\uc790 \uce58\ub8cc \uac1c\uc120, \uc9c4\ub2e8 \uc815\ud655\uc131 \ud5a5\uc0c1 \ubc0f \uc758\ub8cc \uc6b4\uc601 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ud604\uc7ac \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ubaa8\ub378(LMM)\uc774 \uc758\ub8cc \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud2b9\ubcc4\ud788 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 332\uac1c\uc758 \uc2e0\uc911\ud558\uac8c \uc120\uc815\ub41c \uc758\ub8cc \uc0ac\ub840\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc778 MedInsightBench\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \uc5ec\uae30\uc5d0\ub294 \uc2e0\uc911\ud558\uac8c \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc774 \uc8fc\uc11d\uc73c\ub85c \ub2ec\ub824 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub294 LMM\uacfc \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 \uad00\ub828 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \uc81c\uae30\ud558\uace0, \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ubc1c\uacac \uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \ud574\uc11d\ud558\uba70, \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uacfc \uad8c\uc7a5 \uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \uc885\ud569\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub41c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0 \ub530\ub974\uba74 \uae30\uc874 LMM\uc740 MedInsightBench\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uae4a\uc740 \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc744 \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc774 \uc788\uace0 \uc758\ub8cc \uc804\ubb38 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc774\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \uadfc\ubcf8 \uc6d0 \ucc3e\uae30, \ubd84\uc11d \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubc0f \ud6c4\uc18d \uc9c8\ubb38 \uc791\uc131\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubaa8\ub4c8\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \uc758\ub8cc \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 MedInsightAgent\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

A key capability for such systems is performing accurate arithmetic operations on structured data while ensuring sensitive information never leaves secure, on-premises environments. Here, we introduce an error-driven optimization framework for arithmetic reasoning that enhances a Code Generation Agent (CGA), specifically applied to on-premises small language models (SLMs). Through a systematic evaluation of a leading SLM (Qwen3 4B), we find that while the base model exhibits fundamental limitations in arithmetic tasks, our proposed error-driven method, which clusters erroneous predictions to refine prompt-rules iteratively, dramatically improves performance, elevating the model's accuracy to 70.8\\%.

To bridge this gap, we propose Differentiable Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (DERL), a bilevel framework that enables the autonomous discovery of optimal reward signals. In DERL, a Meta-Optimizer evolves a reward function (i.e., Meta-Reward) by composing structured atomic primitives, guiding the training of an inner-loop policy. Crucially, unlike previous evolution, DERL is differentiable in its metaoptimization: it treats the inner-loop validation performance as a signal to update the Meta-Optimizer via reinforcement learning. This allows DERL to approximate the \"meta-gradient\" of task success, progressively learning to generate denser and more actionable feedback. We validate DERL across three distinct domains: robotic agent (ALFWorld), scientific simulation (ScienceWorld), and mathematical reasoning (GSM8k, MATH). Experimental results show that DERL achieves state-of-the-art performance on ALFWorld and ScienceWorld, significantly outperforming methods relying on heuristic rewards, especially in out-of-distribution scenarios. Analysis of the evolutionary trajectory demonstrates that DERL successfully captures the intrinsic structure of tasks, enabling selfimproving agent alignment without human intervention.", "AI": {"tldr": "DERL\uc740 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubc1c\uacac\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc774\uc911 \uad6c\uc870\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218 \uc124\uacc4\uc758 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud2b9\ud788 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud560 \ub54c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218 \uc124\uacc4\ub294 \ud575\uc2ec\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc885\uc885 \ud798\ub4e0 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "DERL\uc740 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc6d0\uc790 \ud504\ub9ac\ubbf8\ud2f0\ube0c\ub97c \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218(Meta-Reward)\ub97c \ubc1c\uc804\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0, \uba54\ud0c0 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub0b4\ubd80 \ub8e8\ud504 \uac80\uc99d \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \uc2e0\ud638\ub85c \uc774\uc6a9\ud574 \uba54\ud0c0 \uc635\ud2f0\ub9c8\uc774\uc800\ub97c \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc DERL\uc740 ALFWorld \ubc0f ScienceWorld\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0, \ud2b9\ud788 \ubd84\ud3ec \ubc16 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud6e8\uc52c \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "DERL\uc740 \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \uace0\uc720\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uc5ec \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uac1c\uc785 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc790\uac00 \uac1c\uc120\ud615 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218\uc758 \uc124\uacc4\ub294 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc559\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc885\uc885 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \ud2b9\ud788 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud560 \ub54c \ub354\uc6b1 \uadf8\ub807\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc774 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub4e4\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \ube14\ub799 \ubc15\uc2a4\ub85c \ucde8\uae09\ud558\ub294 \ubbf8\ubd84 \ubd88\uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc9c4\ud654 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uad6c\uc870\uc640 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc131\uacfc \uac04\uc758 \uc778\uacfc \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c Bridging\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubc1c\uacac\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc774\uc911 \uad6c\uc870\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 \ubbf8\ubd84 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc9c4\ud654 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(DERL)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Measuring Envy-Like Preferences in Multi-Agent Settings", "comment": "Under Review", "summary": "Envy is a common human behavior that shapes competitiveness and can alter outcomes in team settings. As large language models (LLMs) increasingly act on behalf of humans in collaborative and competitive workflows, there is a pressing need to evaluate whether and under what conditions they exhibit envy-like preferences. In this paper, we test whether LLMs show envy-like behavior toward each other. We considered two scenarios: (1) A point allocation game that tests whether a model tries to win over its peer. (2) A workplace setting observing behaviour when recognition is unfair. Our findings reveal consistent evidence of envy-like patterns in certain LLMs, with large variation across models and contexts. For instance, GPT-5-mini and Claude-3.7-Sonnet show a clear tendency to pull down the peer model to equalize outcomes, whereas Mistral-Small-3.2-24B instead focuses on maximizing its own individual gains. These results highlight the need to consider competitive dispositions as a safety and design factor in LLM-based multi-agent systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc774 \uc11c\ub85c \uac04\uc758 \uc9c8\ud22c\uc640 \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\ub294\uc9c0, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uadf8 \uc870\uac74\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM\uc774 \ud611\ub825\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uacbd\uc7c1\uc801\uc778 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud750\ub984\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uac04\uc744 \ub300\uc2e0\ud558\uc5ec \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud558\uac8c \ub428\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uadf8\ub4e4\uc758 \uc9c8\ud22c \uc720\uc0ac \uc120\ud638\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \ub300\ub450\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub97c \uace0\ub824\ud558\uc5ec LLM \uac04\uc758 \uc9c8\ud22c \uc720\uc0ac \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ud588\ub2e4. \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8\ub294 \uc810\uc218 \ud560\ub2f9 \uac8c\uc784\uc73c\ub85c, \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ub3d9\ub8cc\ub97c \uc774\uae30\ub824 \ud558\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc2dc\ud5d8\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub450 \ubc88\uc9f8\ub294 \ubd88\uacf5\uc815\ud55c \uc778\uc815\uc744 \uad00\ucc30\ud558\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud658\uacbd\uc774\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud2b9\uc815 LLM\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c8\ud22c \uc720\uc0ac \ud328\ud134\uc758 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uc99d\uac70\uac00 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\uc73c\uba70, \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ud070 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc774 \uc788\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc608\ub97c \ub4e4\uc5b4, GPT-5-mini\uc640 Claude-3.7-Sonnet\uc740 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ud3c9\uc900\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub3d9\ub8cc \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ub04c\uc5b4\ub0b4\ub9ac\ub824\ub294 \uba85\ud655\ud55c \uacbd\ud5a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4. \ubc18\uba74 Mistral-Small-3.2-24B\ub294 \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \uac1c\ubcc4 \uc774\uc775\uc744 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc9d1\uc911\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uacfc \uc124\uacc4 \uc694\uc18c\ub85c\uc11c \uacbd\uc7c1\uc801 \uc131\ud5a5\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uac15\uc870\ub41c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc9c8\ud22c\ub294 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825\uc744 \ud615\uc131\ud558\uace0 \ud300 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubcc0\ud654\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uc778\uac04 \ud589\ub3d9\uc774\ub2e4. \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc774 \ud611\ub825\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uacbd\uc7c1\uc801\uc778 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud750\ub984\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uac04\uc744 \ub300\uc2e0\ud558\uc5ec \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud558\uac8c \ub428\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \uadf8\ub4e4\uc774 \uc9c8\ud22c\uc640 \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uc120\ud638\ub97c \ubcf4\uc774\ub294\uc9c0\uc640 \uadf8 \uc870\uac74\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 LLM\uc774 \uc11c\ub85c\uc5d0\uac8c \uc9c8\ud22c\uc640 \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub97c \uace0\ub824\ud558\uc600\ub2e4: (1) \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ub3d9\ub8cc\ub97c \uc774\uae30\ub824 \ud558\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ud558\ub294 \uc810\uc218 \ud560\ub2f9 \uac8c\uc784.
