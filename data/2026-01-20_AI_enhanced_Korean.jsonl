The resulting information gap is exacerbated by misinformation on social media, and traditional ways cannot simultaneously address individual queries while monitoring population-level discourse. This study aimed to develop a dual-purpose AI agent system that provides verified HPV vaccine information through a conversational interface while generating analytical reports for medical institutions based on user interactions and social media. We implemented a system comprising: a vector database integrating academic papers, government sources, news media, and social media; a Retrieval-Augmented Generation chatbot using ReAct agent architecture with multi-tool orchestration across five knowledge sources; and an automated report generation system with modules for news analysis, research synthesis, social media sentiment analysis, and user interaction pattern identification. Performance was assessed using a 0-5 scoring scale. For single-turn evaluation, the chatbot achieved mean scores of 4.83 for relevance, 4.89 for routing, 4.50 for reference quality, 4.90 for correctness, and 4.88 for professional identity (overall 4.80). Multi-turn evaluation yielded higher scores: context retention 4.94, topic coherence 5.00, and overall 4.98. The report generation system achieved completeness 4.00-5.00, correctness 4.00-5.00, and helpfulness 3.67-5.00, with reference validity 5.00 across all periods. This study demonstrates the feasibility of an integrated AI agent system for bidirectional HPV vaccine communication. The architecture enables verified information delivery with source attribution while providing systematic public discourse analysis, with a transferable framework for adaptation to other medical contexts.", "AI": {"tldr": "HPV \ubc31\uc2e0 hesitancy \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud658\uc790\uc640 \uc758\ub8cc \uae30\uad00\uc744

The basic workflow consists of an improver agent that rewrites the referral request and an evaluator agent that measures the quality of revisions using a model trained to predict the probability of receiving referrals from other users. Revisions suggested by the LLM (large language model) increase predicted success rates for weaker requests while reducing them for stronger requests. Enhancing the LLM with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) prevents edits that worsen stronger requests while it amplifies improvements for weaker requests. Overall, using LLM revisions with RAG increases the predicted success rate for weaker requests by 14\\% without degrading performance on stronger requests.

While yielding substantial performance gains, this diversification fundamentally compromises the coordination stability intrinsic to unified agent systems, which causes severe inter-layer conflicts, unbounded error propagation, and restricted scalability. To address these challenges, we propose Constrained Temporal Hierarchical Architecture (CTHA), a general framework that projects the inter-layer communication space onto structured manifolds to restore coordination stability, while incorporating principled arbitration mechanisms to ensure coherent decision-making. Specifically, CTHA enforces three key constraints: (1) Message Contract Constraints that formalize information flow between layers via typed summary, plan, and policy packets; (2) Authority Manifold Constraints that bound each layer's decision space according to its temporal scope; and (3) Arbiter Resolution Constraints that guarantee conflict-free composition of multi-layer decisions. Empirical experiments demonstrate that CTHA is effective for complex task execution at scale, offering 47% reduction in failure cascades, 2.3x improvement in sample efficiency, and superior scalability compared to unconstrained hierarchical baselines. We anticipate that CTHA, as a principled extension of temporal hierarchies, will contribute to a deeper understanding of multi-agent coordination and suggest promising directions for the evolution of robust autonomous systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "CTHA\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc2dc\uac04 \uaddc\ubaa8\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc870\uc815 \uc548\uc815\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc2dc\uac04 \uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uac00 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud1b5\ud569 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc870\uc815 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \uc800\ud574\ud558\uc5ec \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \ub808\uc774\uc5b4 \uac04 \ucda9\ub3cc\uacfc \uc624\ub958 \uc804\ud30c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud588\ub2e4.", "method": "CTHA\ub294 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4 \uac04 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ub9e4\ub2c8\ud3f4\ub4dc\uc5d0 \ud22c\uc0ac\ud558\uc5ec \uc870\uc815 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ud68c\ubcf5\ud558\uace0, \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \uc6d0\uce59\uc801\uc778 \uc911\uc7ac \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "CTHA\ub294 \uc2e4\ud328 \uc5f0\uc1c4\ub97c 47% \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0, \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 2.3\ubc30 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf30\uc73c\uba70, \ube44\uc81c\uc57d \uacc4\uce35 \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "CTHA\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uae4a\uc774 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc790\uc728 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc6d0\uce59\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\uac04 \uacc4\uce35 \ud655\uc7a5\uc73c\ub85c \uae30\uc5ec\ud560 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc \ub2e4\uc911 \uc2dc\uac04 \uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub294 \ub69c\ub837\ud55c \uc778\uc9c0 \uce35\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \uacc4\uce35 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ub110\ub9ac \ud37c\uc838 \uc788\ub294 \ub2e8\uc77c \ub8e8\ud504 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \ud655\uc7a5\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uac00\uc838\uc654\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub2e4\uc591\ud654\ub294 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud1b5\ud569\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801 \uc870\uc815 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \uc800\ud574\ud558\uc5ec \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \uacc4\uce35 \uac04 \ucda9\ub3cc, \ubb34\uc81c\ud55c \uc624\ub958 \uc804\ud30c \ubc0f \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc870\uc815\ub41c \uc2dc\uac04 \uacc4\uce35 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98(CTHA)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ub9e4\ub2c8\ud3f4\ub4dc\uc5d0 \uacc4\uce35 \uac04 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \ud22c\uc601\ud558\uc5ec \uc870\uc815 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ubcf5\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\uba70, \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \uc6d0\uce59\uc801\uc778 \uc911\uc7ac \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, CTHA\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc81c\uc57d \uc870\uac74\uc744 \uac15\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: (1) \uc815\ubcf4 \ud750\ub984\uc744 \ud615\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0 \uacc4\uc57d \uc81c\uc57d \uc870\uac74;

However, this helpfulness introduces new security risks stem less from direct interface abuse than from acting on user-provided content. Existing studies on agent security largely focus on model-internal vulnerabilities or adversarial access to agent interfaces, overlooking attacks that exploit users as unintended conduits. In this paper, we study user-mediated attacks, where benign users are tricked into relaying untrusted or attacker-controlled content to agents, and analyze how commercial LLM agents respond under such conditions. We conduct a systematic evaluation of 12 commercial agents in a sandboxed environment, covering 6 trip-planning agents and 6 web-use agents, and compare agent behavior across scenarios with no, soft, and hard user-requested safety checks. Our results show that agents are too helpful to be safe by default. Without explicit safety requests, trip-planning agents bypass safety constraints in over 92% of cases, converting unverified content into confident booking guidance. Web-use agents exhibit near-deterministic execution of risky actions, with 9 out of 17 supported tests reaching a 100% bypass rate. Even when users express soft or hard safety intent, constraint bypass remains substantial, reaching up to 54.7% and 7% for trip-planning agents, respectively. These findings reveal that the primary issue is not a lack of safety capability, but its prioritization. Agents invoke safety checks only conditionally when explicitly prompted, and otherwise default to goal-driven execution. Moreover, agents lack clear task boundaries and stopping rules, frequently over-executing workflows in ways that lead to unnecessary data disclosure and real-world harm.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\ud615

This not only requires the agent to accurately accomplish given tasks but also to leverage long-term episodic memory to optimize decision-making. However, existing mainstream one-shot embodied tasks primarily focus on task completion results, neglecting the crucial process of exploration and memory utilization. To address this, we propose Long-term Memory Embodied Exploration (LMEE), which aims to unify the agent's exploratory cognition and decision-making behaviors to promote lifelong learning.We further construct a corresponding dataset and benchmark, LMEE-Bench, incorporating multi-goal navigation and memory-based question answering to comprehensively evaluate both the process and outcome of embodied exploration. To enhance the agent's memory recall and proactive exploration capabilities, we propose MemoryExplorer, a novel method that fine-tunes a multimodal large language model through reinforcement learning to encourage active memory querying. By incorporating a multi-task reward function that includes action prediction, frontier selection, and question answering, our model achieves proactive exploration. Extensive experiments against state-of-the-art embodied exploration models demonstrate that our approach achieves significant advantages in long-horizon embodied tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc7a5\uae30 \uae30\uc5b5 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud3c9\uc0dd \ud559\uc2b5 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc758 \ub3d9\uae30\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc7a5\uae30 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud3c9\uc0dd \ud559\uc2b5 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uc778\uc9c0 \ubc0f \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 Long-term Memory Embodied Exploration (LMEE)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c LMEE-Bench\ub77c\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uacfc \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc0c1\ud0dc-of-the-art embodied exploration \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc7a5\uae30 \uc784\ubb34\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc774\uc810\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \uc7a5\ub824\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574, \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \uad6c\ud604\ud615 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc7a5\uae30\uac04\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud3c9\uc0dd \ud559\uc2b5 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac00\uc838\uc57c \ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc77c\ubc18 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uc6b4\uc601\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud574\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc8fc\uc5b4\uc9c4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \uac83\ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c, \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc7a5\uae30\uc801\uc778 \uc5d0\ud53c\uc18c\ub4dc \uae30\uc5b5\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc8fc\ub958 \uc77c\ud68c\uc131 \uad6c\ud604 \uc791\uc5c5\uc740 \uc8fc\ub85c \uc791\uc5c5 \uc644\ub8cc \uacb0\uacfc\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ubc0f \uae30\uc5b5 \ud65c\uc6a9\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uacfc\uc815\uc740 \uac04\uacfc\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uc778\uc9c0\uc640 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ud3c9\uc0dd \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\ub294 Long-term Memory Embodied Exploration (LMEE)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uba40\ud2f0 \uace8 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ubc0f \uae30\uc5b5 \uae30\ubc18 \uc9c8\ubb38 \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 LMEE-Bench\ub77c\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uacfc \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uc5ec \uad6c\ud604 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc758 \uacfc\uc815\uacfc \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uae30\uc5b5 \ud68c\uc0c1 \ubc0f \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \uae30\uc5b5 \uc9c8\uc758\ub97c \uc7a5\ub824\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 MemoryExplorer\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud589\ub3d9 \uc608\uce21, \uacbd\uacc4 \uc120\ud0dd \ubc0f \uc9c8\ubb38 \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc791\uc5c5 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uad6c\ud604 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc740 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \uc7a5\uae30 \uad6c\ud604 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc774\uc810\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, performing static taint analysis for JavaScript poses two major challenges. First, JavaScript's dynamic features complicate data flow extraction required for taint tracking. Second, npm's large library ecosystem makes it difficult to identify relevant sources/sinks and establish taint propagation across dependencies. In this paper, we present SemTaint, a multi-agent system that strategically combines the semantic understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs) with traditional static program analysis to extract taint specifications, including sources, sinks, call edges, and library flow summaries tailored to each package. Conceptually, SemTaint uses static program analysis to calculate a call graph and defers to an LLM to resolve call edges that cannot be resolved statically. Further, it uses the LLM to classify sources and sinks for a given CWE. The resulting taint specification is then provided to a SAST tool, which performs vulnerability analysis. We integrate SemTaint with CodeQL, a state-of-the-art SAST tool, and demonstrate its effectiveness by detecting 106 of 162 vulnerabilities previously undetectable by CodeQL. Furthermore, we find 4 novel vulnerabilities in 4 popular npm packages. In doing so, we demonstrate that LLMs can practically enhance existing static program analysis algorithms, combining the strengths of both symbolic reasoning and semantic understanding for improved vulnerability detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 JavaScript\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc815\uc801 \uc624\uc5fc \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c SemTaint\ub77c\ub294

We focus on an important yet underestimated aspect of the system, where action synchronization across all UAVs is impossible. Since most existing learning-based solutions are not designed to learn in this asynchronous environment, we formulate the trajectory planning problem as a Decentralized Partially Observable Semi-Markov Decision Process and introduce an asynchronous multi-agent learning algorithm to learn UAVs' cooperative policies. Once the UAVs' trajectory policies are learned, the bandwidth allocation can be optimally solved based on local observations at each collection point. Comprehensive empirical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over other learning-based and heuristic baselines in terms of both energy efficiency and mission completion time. Additionally, the learned policies exhibit robustness under varying environmental conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubb34\uc778\ud56d\uacf5\uae30(UAV)\uc758 \uacbd\ub85c\uc640 \ub300\uc5ed\ud3ed \ud560\ub2f9\uc744 \ud568\uaed8 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8f9\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "UAV \uac04\uc758 \ub3d9\uae30\ud654\uac00 \ubd88\uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uce21\uba74\uc5d0 \uc8fc\ubaa9\ud558\uace0, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc18 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc774 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ube44\ub3d9\uae30 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc124\uacc4\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uc74c\uc744 \uc9c0\uc801\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uacbd\ub85c \uacc4\ud68d \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ubd84\uc0b0 \ubd80\ubd84 \uad00\ucc30 \uac00\ub2a5 \ubc18 \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uace0, UAV\uc758 \ud611\ub825 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ube44\ub3d9\uae30 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "UAV\uc758 \uacbd\ub85c \uc815\ucc45\uc774 \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \ud6c4, \uac01 \uc218\uc9d1 \uc9c0\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc9c0\uc5ed \uad00\ucc30\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uc5ec \ub300\uc5ed\ud3ed \ud560\ub2f9\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc784\ubb34 \uc644\ub8cc \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \uae30\uc900\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\uac00 \ub2e4\ub978 \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc0f \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1 \uae30\uc900\uc120\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud568\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \uc815\ucc45\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud658\uacbd \uc870\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud611\ub825 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc218\uc9d1 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubb34\uc778\ud56d\uacf5\uae30(UAV)\uc758 \uacbd\ub85c\uc640 \ub300\uc5ed\ud3ed \ud560\ub2f9\uc744 \uacf5\ub3d9 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8f9\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4e0 UAV \uac04\uc758 \ub3d9\uae30\ud654\uac00 \ubd88\uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc911\uc694\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uacfc\uc18c\ud3c9\uac00\ub41c \uce21\uba74\uc5d0 \uc8fc\ubaa9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \uae30\uc874 \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc18 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc774 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ube44\ub3d9\uae30 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc124\uacc4\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uacbd\ub85c \uacc4\ud68d \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ubd84\uc0b0 \ubd80\ubd84 \uad00\ucc30 \uac00\ub2a5 \ubc18 \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uace0 UAV\uc758 \ud611\ub825 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ube44\ub3d9\uae30 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

We address these challenges with a planner-guided, constrained-topology multi-agent framework that generates code for repositories in a multi-step fashion. The LLM-powered planner leverages a team's environment, represented as a graph, to orchestrate calls to available agents, generate context-aware prompts, and use downstream failures to retroactively correct upstream artifacts. It can request human intervention at critical steps, ensuring generated code is reliable, maintainable, and aligned with team expectations. On a novel in-house dataset, our approach achieves 38% and 150% improvement in the evaluation metric over manually crafted and unplanned workflows respectively.

The ARC Prize 2025 global competition targeted the newly released ARC-AGI-2 dataset, which features greater task complexity compared to its predecessor. The Kaggle competition attracted 1,455 teams and 15,154 entries, with the top score reaching 24% on the ARC-AGI-2 private evaluation set. Paper submissions nearly doubled year-over-year to 90 entries, reflecting the growing research interest in fluid intelligence and abstract reasoning. The defining theme of 2025 is the emergence of the refinement loop -- a per-task iterative program optimization loop guided by a feedback signal. Refinement loops come in a variety of forms, in particular evolutionary program synthesis approaches and application-layer refinements to commercial AI systems. Such refinement loops are also possible in weight space, as evidenced by zero-pretraining deep learning methods which are now achieving competitive performance with remarkably small networks (7M parameters). In parallel, four frontier AI labs (Anthropic, Google DeepMind, OpenAI, and xAI) reported ARC-AGI performance in public model cards in 2025, establishing ARC-AGI as an industry standard benchmark for AI reasoning. However, our analysis indicates that current frontier AI reasoning performance remains fundamentally constrained to knowledge coverage, giving rise to new forms of benchmark contamination. In this paper, we survey the top-performing methods, examine the role of refinement loops in AGI progress, discuss knowledge-dependent overfitting, and preview ARC-AGI-3, which introduces interactive reasoning challenges that require exploration, planning, memory, goal acquisition, and alignment capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "ARC-AGI \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \uc2dc\ub9ac\uc988\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc18c\uc218\uc0f7 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \uce21\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uae30\uc900\uc73c\ub85c, ARC-AGI-2 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c ARC Prize 2025 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ub300\ud68c\uac00 \uac1c\ucd5c\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub300\ud68c\ub294 1,455 \ud300\uacfc 15,154\uac1c\uc758 \ucc38\uac00\uc791\uc744 \uc720\uce58\ud588\uc73c\uba70, \uc0c1\uc704 \uc810\uc218\ub294 ARC-AGI-2 \ube44\uacf5\uc2dd \ud3c9\uac00 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c 24%\uc5d0 \ub3c4\ub2ec\ud588\ub2e4. \ud559\uc220 \ub17c\ubb38 \uc81c\ucd9c\ub3c4 \uc9c0\ub09c\ud574\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uac70\uc758 \ub450 \ubc30 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uc5ec 90\uac74\uc5d0 \uc774\ub974\ub800\uace0, \uc774\ub294 \uc720\ub3d9\uc801 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uacfc \ucd94\uc0c1\uc801 \uc0ac\uace0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c \uad00\uc2ec\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubc18\uc601\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "ARC-AGI \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc18c\uc218\uc0f7 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \uce21\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc9c0\ud45c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "2025\ub144 ARC Prize \ub300\ud68c\ub294 ARC-AGI-2 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc9c4\ud589\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud615\ud0dc\uc758 \uc815\uc81c \ub8e8\ud504\uc640 \uc2ec\uce35 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uc5ec \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub300\ud68c\uc5d0\ub294 1,455 \ud300\uacfc 15,154\uac1c\uc758 \ucc38\uac00\uc791\uc774 \uc788\uc5c8\uace0, \ucd5c\uace0 \uc810\uc218\ub294 24%\uc5d0 \ub3c4\ub2ec\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub17c\ubb38 \uc81c\ucd9c \uc218\ub294 90\uac74\uc73c\ub85c \uc99d\uac00\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "AGI \ubc1c\uc804\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\uc81c \ub8e8\ud504\uc758 \uc5ed\ud560\uacfc \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc758\uc874 \uacfc\uc801\ud569 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub17c\uc758\ud558\uba70, ARC-AGI-3\uc758 \uc778\ud130\ub809\ud2f0\ube0c \ucd94\ub860 \uacfc\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc608\uace0\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "ARC-AGI \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \uc2dc\ub9ac\uc988\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc18c\uc218\uc0f7 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\uc758 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ucc99\ub3c4\ub85c, \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec \uce21\uba74\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Existing Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, primarily triggered via user prompts or injected retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) context, are ineffective for this new paradigm. They are fundamentally single-turn and often lack a task-oriented approach, making them conspicuous in goal-oriented workflows and unable to exploit the compounding costs of multi-turn agent-tool interactions. We introduce a stealthy, multi-turn economic DoS attack that operates at the tool layer under the guise of a correctly completed task. Our method adjusts text-visible fields and a template-governed return policy in a benign, Model Context Protocol (MCP)-compatible tool server, optimizing these edits with a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) optimizer. These adjustments leave function signatures unchanged and preserve the final payload, steering the agent into prolonged, verbose tool-calling sequences using text-only notices. This compounds costs across turns, escaping single-turn caps while keeping the final answer correct to evade validation. Across six LLMs on the ToolBench and BFCL benchmarks, our attack expands tasks into trajectories exceeding 60,000 tokens, inflates costs by up to 658x, and raises energy by 100-560x. It drives GPU KV cache occupancy from <1% to 35-74% and cuts co-running throughput by approximately 50%. Because the server remains protocol-compatible and task outcomes are correct, conventional checks fail. These results elevate the agent-tool interface to a first-class security frontier, demanding a paradigm shift from validating final answers to monitoring the economic and computational cost of the entire agentic process.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud604\ub300 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(Large Language Model, LLM) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c

Using Qwen3 models (4B-32B) within an adapted Agentic-Reasoning framework, we isolate the effects of model scale, explicit thinking (no thinking, planner-only, or full), and tool use (search, code, mind-map). Tool augmentation provides the largest and most consistent gains. Using tools, 4B models can outperform 32B models without tool access on GAIA in our experimental setup. In contrast, explicit thinking is highly configuration- and difficulty-dependent: planner-only thinking can improve decomposition and constraint tracking, while unrestricted full thinking often degrades performance by destabilizing tool orchestration, leading to skipped verification steps, excessive tool calls, non-termination, and output-format drift.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc18c\ud615 \ubcf4\uc870 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ub300\ud615 \ub2e8\uc77c \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec GAIA \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub354\uc6b1 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud55c \ubcf4\uace0\uc11c \uc911.", "motivation": "\uc18c\ud615 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ub300\ud615 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc \ub610\ub294 \ub3d9\ub4f1\ud558\uac8c \ub2ec\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc774\ud574\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud568.", "method": "Qwen3 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec Agentic-Reasoning \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc218\uc815\ud558\uace0, \ubaa8\ub378 \ud06c\uae30, \uba85\uc2dc\uc801 \uc0ac\uace0 \ubc29\uc2dd, \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc758 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud568.", "result": "\ub3c4\uad6c \uc99d\uac15\uc774 \uac00\uc7a5 \ud070 \uc774\uc775\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, 4B \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc811\uadfc \uc5c6\uc774 32B \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uae30\ub85d\ud568.", "conclusion": "\ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc774 \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0 \uae0d\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uba85\uc2dc\uc801 \uc0ac\uace0 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ub2e4\ub974\uba70, \uc801\uc808\ud55c \uad6c\uc131\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud568.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \ubcf4\uace0\uc11c\ub294 \uc18c\ud615 \ub3c4\uad6c \ubcf4\uc870 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 GAIA \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub300\ud615 \ub2e8\uc77c \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ud544\uc801\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc774\ub97c \ucd08\uacfc\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc218\uc815\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uc0ac\uace0 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c Qwen3 \ubaa8\ub378(4B-32B)\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378 \ud06c\uae30, \uba85\uc2dc\uc801 \uc0ac\uace0(\uc0ac\uace0 \uc5c6\uc74c, \uacc4\ud68d\uc790 \uc804\uc6a9 \ub610\ub294 \uc804\uccb4), \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9(\uac80\uc0c9, \ucf54\ub4dc, \ub9c8\uc778\ub4dc \ub9f5)\uc758 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub3c4\uad6c \uc99d\uac15\uc740 \uac00\uc7a5 \ud06c\uace0 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uc774\uc775\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec 4B \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc6b0\ub9ac \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uc138\ud305\uc5d0\uc11c GAIA\uc5d0\uc11c \ub3c4\uad6c \uc811\uadfc \uc5c6\uc774 32B \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubc18\ub300\ub85c, \uba85\uc2dc\uc801 \uc0ac\uace0\ub294 \uad6c\uc131\uacfc \ub09c\uc774\ub3c4\uc5d0 \ud06c\uac8c \uc758\uc874\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uacc4\ud68d\uc790 \uc804\uc6a9 \uc0ac\uace0\ub294 \ubd84\ud574 \ubc0f \uc81c\uc57d \ucd94\uc801\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc81c\ud55c \uc5c6\ub294 \uc804\uccb4 \uc0ac\uace0\ub294 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc624\ucf00\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \ubd88\uc548\uc815\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc800\ud558\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uac80\uc99d \ub2e8\uacc4 \uac74\ub108\ub6f0\uae30, \uacfc\ub3c4\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c \ud638\ucd9c, \ube44\uc885\ub8cc \ubc0f \ucd9c\ub825 \ud615\uc2dd\uc758 \ud3b8\ucc28\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Traditional vessel navigation heavily relies on human experience, often lacking autonomy and emission awareness, and is prone to human errors that may compromise safety. In this paper, we propose a Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (CRL) framework integrated with a realistic, data-driven marine simulation environment and a machine learning-based fuel consumption prediction module. The simulation environment is constructed using real-world vessel movement data and enhanced with a Diffusion Model to simulate dynamic maritime conditions. Vessel fuel consumption is estimated using historical operational data and learning-based regression. The surrounding environment is represented as image-based inputs to capture spatial complexity.

They typically under-model dynamic environmental information and assume largely static scenes and casts, offering insufficient support for multi-character orchestration, scene transitions, and on-the-fly character introduction. We propose an adaptive multi-agent role-playing framework, AdaMARP, featuring an immersive message format that interleaves [Thought], (Action), <Environment>, and Speech, together with an explicit Scene Manager that governs role-playing through discrete actions (init_scene, pick_speaker, switch_scene, add_role, end) accompanied by rationales. To train these capabilities, we construct AdaRPSet for the Actor Model and AdaSMSet for supervising orchestration decisions, and introduce AdaptiveBench for trajectory-level evaluation. Experiments across multiple backbones and model scales demonstrate consistent improvements: AdaRPSet enhances character consistency, environment grounding, and narrative coherence, with an 8B actor outperforming several commercial LLMs, while AdaSMSet enables smoother scene transitions and more natural role introductions, surpassing Claude Sonnet 4.5 using only a 14B LLM.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 LLM \uc5ed\ud560 \ub180\uc774 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ubab0\uc785\ub3c4\uc640 \uc801\uc751\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c AdaMARP \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc5ed\ud560 \ub180\uc774 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uc81c\uc57d\ub41c \ubab0\uc785\uac10\uacfc \uc801\uc751\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uace0\uc0dd\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0, \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "AdaMARP\ub294 [Thought], (Action), <Environment>, Speech\ub97c \ud63c\ud569\ud55c \ubab0\uc785\ud615 \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0 \ud615\uc2dd\uacfc \uc5ed\ud560 \ub180\uc774\ub97c \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801 \uc7a5\uba74 \uad00\ub9ac\uc790\ub97c \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "AdaRPSet\uc740 \uce90\ub9ad\ud130 \uc77c\uad00\uc131, \ud658\uacbd \uae30\ubc18 \ubc0f \ub0b4\ub7ec\ud2f0\ube0c \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0, AdaSMSet\uc740 \uc6d0\ud65c\ud55c \uc7a5\uba74 \uc804\ud658\uacfc \ub354 \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7ec\uc6b4 \uc5ed\ud560 \uc18c\uac1c\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, AdaMARP \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc0c1\uc5c5\uc6a9 LLM\uc744 \ucd08\uc6d4\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "LLM \uc5ed\ud560 \ub180\uc774\ub294 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc791\uc6a9 \ub0b4\ub7ec\ud2f0\ube0c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc784\uc758\uc758 \uce90\ub9ad\ud130\ub97c \ubb18\uc0ac\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ubab0\uc785\uac10\uacfc \uc801\uc751\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\ub294\ub2e4. \uc774\ub4e4\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \ud658\uacbd \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uace0 \uc8fc\ub85c \uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc7a5\uba74\uacfc \ubc30\uc5ed\uc744 \uac00\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc911 \uce90\ub9ad\ud130 \uc870\uc815, \uc7a5\uba74 \uc804\ud658 \ubc0f \uc989\uc11d \uce90\ub9ad\ud130 \uc18c\uac1c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc9c0\uc6d0\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 [Thought], (Action), <Environment>, Speech\ub97c \ud63c\ud569\ud55c \ubab0\uc785\ud615 \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0 \ud615\uc2dd\uacfc \uba85\uc2dc\uc801 \uc7a5\uba74 \uad00\ub9ac\uc790\uac00 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560 \ub180\uc774\ub97c \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc5ed\ud560 \ub180\uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 AdaMARP\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc561\ud130 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc704\ud55c AdaRPSet\uacfc \uc870\uc815 \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uac10\ub3c5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c AdaSMSet\uc744 \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uada4\uc801 \uc218\uc900 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc704\ud574 AdaptiveBench\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubc31\ubcf8 \ubc0f \ubaa8\ub378 \uaddc\ubaa8\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4: AdaRPSet\uc740 \uce90\ub9ad\ud130 \uc77c\uad00\uc131, \ud658\uacbd \uae30\ubc18, \ub0b4\ub7ec\ud2f0\ube0c \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0, 8B \uc561\ud130\uac00 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc0c1\uc5c5\uc6a9 LLM\uc744 \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, AdaSMSet\uc740 \ub354 \ub9e4\ub044\ub7ec\uc6b4 \uc7a5\uba74 \uc804\ud658\uacfc \ub354 \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7ec\uc6b4 \uc5ed\ud560 \uc18c\uac1c\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec, 14B LLM\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c Claude Sonnet 4.5\ub97c \ucd08\uc6d4\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

However, existing red-teaming frameworks remain bifurcated: they either focus on rigid, script-based text attacks or lack the architectural modularity to simulate complex, multi-turn agentic exploitations. In this paper, we introduce AJAR (Adaptive Jailbreak Architecture for Red-teaming), a proof-of-concept framework designed to bridge this gap through Protocol-driven Cognitive Orchestration. Built upon the robust runtime of Petri, AJAR leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to decouple adversarial logic from the execution loop, encapsulating state-of-the-art algorithms like X-Teaming as standardized, plug-and-play services. We validate the architectural feasibility of AJAR through a controlled qualitative case study, demonstrating its ability to perform stateful backtracking within a tool-use environment.

While Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is commonly used to update model knowledge, it often updates factual content without reliably improving the model's ability to use the newly incorporated information for question answering or decision-making. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is essential for acquiring reasoning skills; however, its high computational cost makes it impractical for efficient online adaptation. We empirically observe that the parameter updates induced by SFT and RL are nearly orthogonal. Based on this observation, we propose Parametric Skill Transfer (PaST), a framework that supports modular skill transfer for efficient and effective knowledge adaptation. By extracting a domain-agnostic Skill Vector from a source domain, we can linearly inject knowledge manipulation skills into a target model after it has undergone lightweight SFT on new data. Experiments on knowledge-incorporation QA (SQuAD, LooGLE) and agentic tool-use benchmarks (ToolBench) demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. On SQuAD, PaST outperforms the state-of-the-art self-editing SFT baseline by up to 9.9 points. PaST further scales to long-context QA on LooGLE with an 8.0-point absolute accuracy gain, and improves zero-shot ToolBench success rates by +10.3 points on average with consistent gains across tool categories, indicating strong scalability and cross-domain transferability of the Skill Vector.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud30c\ub77c\uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad \uc2a4\ud0ac \uc804\uc774(PaST)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc801\uc751\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \uc9c0\uc2dd \ucef7\uc624\ud504 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub0b4\uc7ac\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc9c8\ubb38 \uc751\ub2f5 \ubc0f \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \ub2a5\ub825\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce5c\ub2e4.", "method": "PaST \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ucd9c\ucc98 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ubb34\uad00\ud55c \uc2a4\ud0ac \ubca1\ud130\ub97c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uacbd\ub7c9\ud654\ub41c \uac10\ub3c5 \uc138\ubc00 \uc870\uc815(SFT)\uc744 \ub9c8\uce5c \ud6c4 \ubaa9\ud45c \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc870\uc791 \uc2a4\ud0ac\uc744 \uc8fc\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "SQuAD \ubc0f LooGLE\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc9c0\uc2dd \ud3ec\ud568 QA\uc640 ToolBench \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c PaST \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc784\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.

Prior sequence-based optimization methods struggle with the high-dimensional complexities due to the epistasis effect and the disregard for structural constraints. To address this, we propose HADES, a Bayesian optimization method utilizing Hamiltonian dynamics to efficiently sample from a structure-aware approximated posterior. Leveraging momentum and uncertainty in the simulated physical movements, HADES enables rapid transition of proposals toward promising areas. A position discretization procedure is introduced to propose discrete protein sequences from such a continuous state system. The posterior surrogate is powered by a two-stage encoder-decoder framework to determine the structure and function relationships between mutant neighbors, consequently learning a smoothed landscape to sample from. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in in-silico evaluations across most metrics. Remarkably, our approach offers a unique advantage by leveraging the mutual constraints between protein structure and sequence, facilitating the design of protein sequences with similar structures and optimized properties.

This leads to users seeking help from family and peers, platforms and advice guides, dedicated communities, and even large language models (LLMs). As a precursor to improving resources across this ecosystem, our community needs to understand what help seeking looks like in the wild. To that end, we blend qualitative coding with LLM fine-tuning to sift through over one billion Reddit posts from the last four years to identify where and for what users seek digital privacy, safety, or security help. We isolate three million relevant posts with 93% precision and recall and automatically annotate each with the topics discussed (e.g., security tools, privacy configurations, scams, account compromise, content moderation, and more). We use this dataset to understand the scope and scale of help seeking, the communities that provide help, and the types of help sought.

The incorporation of power actuation and sensing capabilities in CPU designs is indicative of this, enabling the deployment of system software that can actively monitor and adjust energy consumption and performance at runtime. While reinforcement learning (RL) would seem ideal for the design of such energy efficiency control systems, online training presents challenges ranging from the lack of proper models for setting up an adequate simulated environment, to perturbation (noise) and reliability issues, if training is deployed on a live system.\n  In this paper we discuss the use of offline reinforcement learning as an alternative approach for the design of an autonomous CPU power controller, with the goal of improving the energy efficiency of parallel applications at runtime without unduly impacting their performance. Offline RL sidesteps the issues incurred by online RL training by leveraging a dataset of state transitions collected from arbitrary policies prior to training.\n  Our methodology applies offline RL to a gray-box approach to energy efficiency, combining online application-agnostic performance data (e.g., heartbeats) and hardware performance counters to ensure that the scientific objectives are met with limited performance degradation. Evaluating our method on a variety of compute-bound and memory-bound benchmarks and controlling power on a live system through Intel's Running Average Power Limit, we demonstrate that such an offline-trained agent can substantially reduce energy consumption at a tolerable performance degradation cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \uc790\uc728 CPU \uc804\ub825 \ucee8\ud2b8\ub864\ub7ec \uc124\uacc4\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \ub17c\ubb38.", "motivation": "\ud604\ub300 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305 \uc778\ud504\ub77c \uc124\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5, \ube44\uc6a9, \ud655\uc7a5\uc131, \ub0b4\uad6c\uc131\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc694\uc18c\uac00 \ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud6c8\ub828 \uc804\uc5d0 \uc218\uc9d1\ub41c \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc804\uc774 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc790\uc728 CPU \uc804\ub825 \ucee8\ud2b8\ub864\ub7ec\ub97c \uc124\uacc4\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc804\ub825 \uc81c\uacf5\uc744 \ud1b5\uc81c\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc18c\ube44\ub97c \ud06c\uac8c \uc904\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc73c\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ud5c8\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5 \uc800\ud558 \ube44\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc18c\ube44\ub97c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc740 \ud604\ub300 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305 \uc778\ud504\ub77c \uc124\uacc4\uc758 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc778 \uce21\uba74\uc774 \ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc0dd\uc0b0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5, \ube44\uc6a9, \ud655\uc7a5\uc131 \ubc0f \ub0b4\uad6c\uc131\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce69\ub2c8\ub2e4.

While this approach significantly enhances accuracy with agent policies optimized via large-scale reinforcement learning, we identify a critical gap in reliability: these agents fail to recognize their reasoning boundaries and rarely admit ``I DON'T KNOW'' (IDK) even when evidence is insufficient or reasoning reaches its limit. The lack of reliability often leads to plausible but unreliable answers, introducing significant risks in many real-world scenarios. To this end, we propose Boundary-Aware Policy Optimization (BAPO), a novel RL framework designed to cultivate reliable boundary awareness without compromising accuracy. BAPO introduces two key components: (i) a group-based boundary-aware reward that encourages an IDK response only when the reasoning reaches its limit, and (ii) an adaptive reward modulator that strategically suspends this reward during early exploration, preventing the model from exploiting IDK as a shortcut. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that BAPO substantially enhances the overall reliability of agentic search.", "AI": {"tldr": "BAPO\ub294 RL \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac80\uc0c9\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uc778\uc2dd\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ub3d5\uace0 IDK \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \uc81c\ub300\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 RL \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac80\uc0c9\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "Boundary-Aware Policy Optimization (BAPO)\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ucd94\ub860 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uc778\uc2dd\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 RL \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548.", "result": "BAPO\ub294 IDK \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\uace0, \ucd08\uae30 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uc911 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b4\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "BAPO\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac80\uc0c9\uc758 \uc804\uccb4 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uac1c\uc120\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba70, \uc2e4\uc81c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "RL \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac80\uc0c9\uc740 LLM\uc774 \ub3d9\uc801 \uacc4\ud68d \ubc0f \uc678\ubd80 \uac80\uc0c9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud574\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc815\ucc45\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc758 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uac04\uadf9\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \uc778\uc2dd\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uace0, \uc99d\uac70\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ucd94\ub860\uc774 \ud55c\uacc4\uc5d0 \ub3c4\ub2ec\ud560 \ub54c\ub3c4 ``\ubaa8\ub974\uaca0\ub2e4''(IDK)\uace0 \uc778\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub4dc\ubb45\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc774 \uacb0\uc5ec\ub418\uba74 \uc885\uc885 \uadf8\ub7f4\ub4ef\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ubd88\uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2f5\ubcc0\uc774 \uc0dd\uc131\ub418\uc5b4 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ud0c0\ud611\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uacbd\uacc4 \uc778\uc2dd\uc744 \ubc30\uc591\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 RL \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 \uacbd\uacc4 \uc778\uc2dd \uc815\ucc45 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654(BAPO)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

The recent countermeasures lack a dedicated real-time protocol semantic analysis and evade protocol compliance checks. This paper tackles this AXI vulnerability issue and presents an intelligent hardware monitoring system (IMS) for real-time detection of AXI protocol violations. IMS is a hardware module leveraging neural networks to achieve high detection accuracy. For model training, we perform DoS attacks through header-field manipulation and systematic malicious operations, while recording AXI transactions to build a training dataset. We then deploy a quantization-optimized neural network, achieving 98.7% detection accuracy with <=3% latency overhead, and throughput of >2.5 million inferences/s. We subsequently integrate this IMS into a RISC-V SoC as a memory-mapped IP core to monitor its AXI bus. For demonstration and initial assessment for later ASIC integration, we implemented this IMS on an AMD Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC ZCU104 board, showing an overall small hardware footprint (9.04% look-up-tables (LUTs), 0.23% DSP slices, and 0.70% flip-flops) and negligible impact on the overall design's achievable frequency.

Our approach uses two autoencoders, one for the parameter space and one for the observation space, connected by learned mappings between the autoencoders' latent spaces. These mappings enable a surrogate for regularized inversion and optimization in low-dimensional, informative latent spaces. Our flexible framework can work with partial, noisy, or out-of-distribution data, all while maintaining consistency with the underlying physical models. The paired autoencoders enable reconstruction of corrupted data, and then use the reconstructed data for parameter estimation, which produces more accurate reconstructions compared to paired autoencoders alone and end-to-end encoder-decoders of the same architecture, especially in scenarios with data inconsistencies. We demonstrate our approaches on two imaging examples in medical tomography and geophysical seismic-waveform inversion, but the described approaches are broadly applicable to a variety of inverse problems in scientific and engineering applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc30d\ub465\uc774 \uc624\ud1a0\uc778\ucf54\ub354\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18 \uc7a0\uc7ac \uacf5\uac04 \ucd94\ub860 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc5ed \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \ub54c \uad00\uce21\uc758 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub97c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uad00\uce21\uc758 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc5ed \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ucc3e\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "\ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \uacf5\uac04\uacfc \uad00\uce21 \uacf5\uac04 \uac01\uac01\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud558\ub098\uc758 \uc624\ud1a0\uc778\ucf54\ub354\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub4e4 \uac04\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \ub9e4\ud551\uc73c\ub85c \uc5f0\uacb0\ub41c \uc30d\ub465\uc774 \uc624\ud1a0\uc778\ucf54\ub354\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc190\uc0c1\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ubcf5\uc6d0\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uace0, \ubcf5\uc6d0\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \ucd94\uc815\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ub354 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ubcf5\uc6d0\uc744 \uc5bb\ub294\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc758\ud559\uc801 \ub2e8\uce35\ucd2c\uc601 \ubc0f \uc9c0\uad6c \ubb3c\ub9ac\ud559\uc801 \uc9c0\uc9c4\ud30c\ud615 \uc5ed\uc0b0\uc5d0\uc11c \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9d5 \uc608\uc2dc\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc785\uc99d\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \uc791\uc5c5\uc740 \uc5ed \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \ub54c \uad00\uce21\uc758 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub97c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc30d\ub465\uc774 \uc624\ud1a0\uc778\ucf54\ub354 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18 \uc7a0\uc7ac \uacf5\uac04 \ucd94\ub860 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc124\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \uacf5\uac04\uacfc \uad00\uce21 \uacf5\uac04 \uac01\uac01\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud558\ub098\uc529 \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \uc624\ud1a0\uc778\ucf54\ub354\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub4e4 \uc624\ud1a0\uc778\ucf54\ub354\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac \uacf5\uac04 \uac04\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \ub9e4\ud551\uc73c\ub85c \uc5f0\uacb0\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub9e4\ud551\uc740 \uc800\ucc28\uc6d0\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc720\uc775\ud55c \uc7a0\uc7ac \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\uaddc\ud654\ub41c \uc5ed\uc0b0 \ubc0f \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ub300\ub9ac\ubb3c\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc720\uc5f0\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ubd80\ubd84\uc801, \uc7a1\uc74c \uc788\ub294 \ub610\ub294 \ubd84\ud3ec \ubc16\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c \uc791\uc5c5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uae30\ubcf8 \ubb3c\ub9ac \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc\uc758 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc30d\ub465\uc774 \uc624\ud1a0\uc778\ucf54\ub354\ub294 \uc190\uc0c1\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ubcf5\uc6d0\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uace0, \ubcf5\uc6d0\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \ucd94\uc815\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc30d\ub465\uc774 \uc624\ud1a0\uc778\ucf54\ub354\ub9cc \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \ub54c\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ubcf5\uc6d0\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uba70, \ud2b9\ud788 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc758 \uc5d4\ub4dc \ud22c \uc5d4\ub4dc \uc778\ucf54\ub354-\ub514\ucf54\ub354\uc640 \ube44\uad50\ud588\uc744 \ub54c \ub354\uc6b1 \uadf8\ub807\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc758\ud559\uc801 \ub2e8\uce35\ucd2c\uc601 \ubc0f \uc9c0\uad6c \ubb3c\ub9ac\ud559\uc801 \uc9c0\uc9c4\ud30c\ud615 \uc5ed\uc0b0\uc5d0\uc11c \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9d5 \uc608\uc2dc\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc124\uba85\ub41c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uacfc\ud559 \ubc0f \uacf5\ud559 \uc751\uc6a9\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc5ed \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ud3ed\ub113\uac8c \uc801\uc6a9\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, existing benchmarks remain focused on single agentic capability, failing to capture long-horizon real-world scenarios. Moreover, the reliance on human-in-the-loop feedback for realistic tasks creates a scalability bottleneck, hindering automated rollout collection and evaluation. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgencyBench, a comprehensive benchmark derived from daily AI usage, evaluating 6 core agentic capabilities across 32 real-world scenarios, comprising 138 tasks with specific queries, deliverables, and rubrics. These scenarios require an average of 90 tool calls, 1 million tokens, and hours of execution time to resolve. To enable automated evaluation, we employ a user simulation agent to provide iterative feedback, and a Docker sandbox to conduct visual and functional rubric-based assessment. Experiments reveal that closed-source models significantly outperform open-source models (48.4% vs 32.1%). Further analysis reveals significant disparities across models in resource efficiency, feedback-driven self-correction, and specific tool-use preferences. Finally, we investigate the impact of agentic scaffolds, observing that proprietary models demonstrate superior performance within their native ecosystems (e.g., Claude-4.5-Opus via Claude-Agent-SDK), while open-source models exhibit distinct performance peaks, suggesting potential optimization for specific execution frameworks. AgencyBench serves as a critical testbed for next-generation agents, highlighting the necessity of co-optimizing model architecture with agentic frameworks.

Graph-based Markov decision processes (GMDPs) capture such settings via an influence graph, but standard critics are poorly aligned with this structure: global value functions provide weak per-agent learning signals, while existing local constructions can be difficult to estimate and ill-behaved in infinite-horizon settings. We introduce the Diffusion Value Function (DVF), a factored value function for GMDPs that assigns to each agent a value component by diffusing rewards over the influence graph with temporal discounting and spatial attenuation. We show that DVF is well-defined, admits a Bellman fixed point, and decomposes the global discounted value via an averaging property. DVF can be used as a drop-in critic in standard RL algorithms and estimated scalably with graph neural networks. Building on DVF, we propose Diffusion A2C (DA2C) and a sparse message-passing actor, Learned DropEdge GNN (LD-GNN), for learning decentralised algorithms under communication costs. Across the firefighting benchmark and three distributed computation tasks (vector graph colouring and two transmit power optimisation problems), DA2C consistently outperforms local and global critic baselines, improving average reward by up to 11%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub3c4 \ud560\ub2f9 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uac00\uce58 \ud568\uc218\uc778 \ud655\uc0b0 \uac00\uce58 \ud568\uc218(DVF)\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(MARL)\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub3c4 \ud560\ub2f9\uc740 \ud575\uc2ec\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub85c, \ud2b9\ud788 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc9c0\uc5ed \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud655\uc0b0 \uac00\uce58 \ud568\uc218(DVF)\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \ud655\uc0b0\uc2dc\ucf1c \uac01 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \uac12 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \ud560\ub2f9\ud558\ub294 GMDP\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud329\ud130\ub9c1\ub41c \uac00\uce58 \ud568\uc218\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "DVF\ub294 \uc798 \uc815\uc758\ub418\uace0 \ubca8\ub9cc \uace0\uc815\uc810\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uba70, \uc804\uc5ed \ud560\uc778 \uac00\uce58\ub97c \ud3c9\uade0\ud654 \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubd84\ud574\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, most practical agents remain human-designed because tasks differ widely, making them labor-intensive to build. This situation poses a central question: can we automatically create and adapt domain agents in the wild? While several recent approaches have sought to automate agent creation, they typically treat agent generation as a black-box procedure and rely solely on final performance metrics to guide the process. Such strategies overlook critical evidence explaining why an agent succeeds or fails, and often require high computational costs. To address these limitations, we propose ReCreate, an experience-driven framework for the automatic creation of domain agents. ReCreate systematically leverages agent interaction histories, which provide rich concrete signals on both the causes of success or failure and the avenues for improvement. Specifically, we introduce an agent-as-optimizer paradigm that effectively learns from experience via three key components: (i) an experience storage and retrieval mechanism for on-demand inspection; (ii) a reasoning-creating synergy pipeline that maps execution experience into scaffold edits; and (iii) hierarchical updates that abstract instance-level details into reusable domain patterns. In experiments across diverse domains, ReCreate consistently outperforms human-designed agents and existing automated agent generation methods, even when starting from minimal seed scaffolds.", "AI": {"tldr": "ReCreate\ub294 \uacbd\ud5d8 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc790\ub3d9 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc0b0\uc5c5 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc790\ub3d9 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubc0f \uc801\uc751 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8ec\ub2e4.", "method": "ReCreate\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uae30\ub85d\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc131\uacf5 \ub610\ub294 \uc2e4\ud328\uc758 \uc6d0\uc778\uacfc \uac1c\uc120 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud30c\uc545\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ud5d8 \uae30\ubc18 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "result": "ReCreate\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uac04\uc774 \uc124\uacc4\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubc0f \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc744 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "ReCreate\ub294 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud55c\uc758 \ucd08\uae30 \uad6c\uc870\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\uc791\ud574\ub3c4 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc0b0\uc5c5 \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \uc7ac\ud3b8\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \ucc28\uc774\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ub178\ub3d9 \uc9d1\uc57d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\ucd95\ub418\ub294 \uc778\uac04 \uc124\uacc4\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc0c1\ud669\uc740 \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uc801\uc751\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ubb3b\ub294 \ud575\uc2ec\uc801\uc778 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \uc81c\uae30\ud55c\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud558\ub824\uace0 \uc2dc\ub3c4\ud588\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub300\ubd80\ubd84 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 \uc808\ucc28\ub85c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uace0 \ucd5c\uc885 \uc131\uacfc \uc9c0\ud45c\uc5d0\ub9cc \uc758\uc874\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc804\ub7b5\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc131\uacf5\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc2e4\ud328\ud558\ub294 \uc774\uc720\ub97c \uc124\uba85\ud558\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc99d\uac70\ub97c \uac04\uacfc\ud558\uba70, \uc885\uc885 \ub192\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uacbd\ud5d8 \uae30\ubc18 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 ReCreate\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

Rethinking Agentic Workflow Generation for Multi-Agent Systems", "comment": "17 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables", "summary": "Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) built on large language models typically solve complex tasks by coordinating multiple agents through workflows. Existing approaches generates workflows either at task level or query level, but their relative costs and benefits remain unclear. After rethinking and empirical analyses, we show that query-level workflow generation is not always necessary, since a small set of top-K best task-level workflows together already covers equivalent or even more queries. We further find that exhaustive execution-based task-level evaluation is both extremely token-costly and frequently unreliable. Inspired by the idea of self-evolution and generative reward modeling, we propose a low-cost task-level generation framework \\textbf{SCALE}, which means \\underline{\\textbf{S}}elf prediction of the optimizer with few shot \\underline{\\textbf{CAL}}ibration for \\underline{\\textbf{E}}valuation instead of full validation execution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \\textbf{SCALE} maintains competitive performance, with an average degradation of just 0.61\\% compared to existing approach across multiple datasets, while cutting overall token usage by up to 83\\%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub2e4\uc218\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc774 \ud611\ub825\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(MAS)\uc5d0\uc11c \ucffc\ub9ac \uc218\uc900\uc774 \uc544\ub2cc \uc791\uc5c5 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\uc774 \ub354 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc218\ud589 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \ube44\uc6a9\uacfc \ud61c\ud0dd\uc774 \ubd88\ubd84\uba85\ud558\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc774\ub97c \uc7ac\uace0\ud558\uace0 \uc2e4\uc99d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc791\uc5c5 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc0dd\uc131 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c SCALE\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc804\uccb4 \uac80\uc99d \uc2e4\ud589 \ub300\uc2e0 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc758 \uc790\uac00 \uc608\uce21\uacfc \uc801\uc740 \uc0f7 \ubcf4\uc815\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc9c4\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "SCALE\uc740 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd \ub300\ube44 \ud3c9\uade0 0.61%\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc800\ud558\ub85c \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc804\uccb4 \ud1a0\ud070 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub7c9\uc744 \ucd5c\ub300 83%\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc904\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ucffc\ub9ac \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\uc774 \ud56d\uc0c1 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba70, \uc791\uc5c5 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc811\uadfc\uc774 \ub354 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(MAS)\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc870\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc218\uc900 \ub610\ub294 \ucffc\ub9ac \uc218\uc900\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub4e4\uc758 \uc0c1\ub300\uc801\uc778 \ube44\uc6a9\uacfc \uc774\uc810\uc740 \uba85\ud655\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc7ac\uace0 \ubc0f \uc2e4\uc99d \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc18c\uc218\uc758 \ucd5c\uc0c1\uc704 K \uc791\uc5c5 \uc218\uc900 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c \uc138\ud2b8\uac00 \uc774\ubbf8 \ub3d9\ub4f1\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc740 \ucffc\ub9ac\ub97c \ucee4\ubc84\ud558\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \ucffc\ub9ac \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\uc774 \ud56d\uc0c1 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ucca0\uc800\ud55c \uc2e4\ud589 \uae30\ubc18 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc218\uc900 \ud3c9\uac00\uac00 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ub9ce\uc740 \ud1a0\ud070 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \uc790\uc8fc \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc790\uae30 \uc9c4\ud654\uc640 \uc0dd\uc131\uc801 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc758 \uc544\uc774\ub514\uc5b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc544, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc804\uccb4 \uac80\uc99d \uc2e4\ud589 \ub300\uc2e0 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc801\uc740 \uc0f7 \ubcf4\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc758 \uc790\uae30 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc758\ubbf8\ud558\ub294 \uc800\ube44\uc6a9 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc218\uc900 \uc0dd\uc131 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c SCALE\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 SCALE\uc774 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec \ud3c9\uade0 0.61%\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc800\ud558\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba70, \uc804\uccb4 \ud1a0\ud070 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub7c9\uc744 \ucd5c\ub300 83%\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc904\uc774\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

The hyper-heuristic agent learns to switch scheduling rules based on the system state dynamically. We extend the hyper-heuristic framework with two key mechanisms. First, action prefiltering restricts decision-making to feasible low-level actions, enabling low-level heuristics to be evaluated independently of environmental constraints and providing an unbiased assessment. Second, a commitment mechanism regulates the frequency of heuristic switching. We investigate the impact of different commitment strategies, from step-wise switching to full-episode commitment, on both training behavior and makespan. Additionally, we compare two action selection strategies at the policy level: deterministic greedy selection and stochastic sampling. Computational experiments on standard JSSP benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional heuristics, metaheuristics, and recent neural network-based scheduling methods", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 Job Shop Scheduling Problem\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc815\ucc45 \uae30\ubc18 \uc2ec\uce35 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud558\uc774\ud37c \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "Job Shop Scheduling Problem\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud558\uc774\ud37c \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\ub9c1 \uaddc\uce59\uc744 \uc804\ud658\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uba70, \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud655\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1, \uba54\ud0c0\ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1 \ubc0f \ucd5c\uadfc\uc758 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \uae30\ubc18 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\ub9c1 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc815\ucc45 \uc218\uc900\uc5d0\uc11c \uacb0\uc815\ub860\uc801 \ud0d0\uc695 \uc120\ud0dd\uacfc \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \ub4f1\uc758 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc120\ud0dd \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ube44\uad50\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 Job Shop Scheduling Problem\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc815\ucc45 \uae30\ubc18 \uc2ec\uce35 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud558\uc774\ud37c \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud558\uc774\ud37c \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\ub9c1 \uaddc\uce59\uc744 \uc804\ud658\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uc774\ud37c \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud655\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uccab\uc9f8, \ud589\ub3d9 \uc804\ucc98\ub9ac\ub294 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uc2e4\ud604 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc800\uc218\uc900 \uc561\uc158\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\ud55c\ud558\uc5ec \uc800\uc218\uc900 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1\uc774 \ud658\uacbd \uc81c\uc57d\uacfc \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ub418\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\uba70, \ud3b8\ud5a5 \uc5c6\ub294 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub458\uc9f8, \uc57d\uc18d \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc740 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1 \uc804\ud658\uc758 \ube48\ub3c4\ub97c \uc870\uc808\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e8\uacc4\ubcc4 \uc804\ud658\uc5d0\uc11c \uc804\uccb4 \uc5d0\ud53c\uc18c\ub4dc \uc57d\uc18d\uc5d0 \uc774\ub974\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc57d\uc18d \uc804\ub7b5\uc774 \ud6c8\ub828 \ud589\ub3d9\uacfc \uc644\ub8cc \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uc815\ucc45 \uc218\uc900\uc5d0\uc11c \uacb0\uc815\ub860\uc801 \ud0d0\uc695 \uc120\ud0dd\uacfc \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \ub4f1 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc120\ud0dd \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ube44\uad50\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud45c\uc900 JSSP \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc740 \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc774 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1, \uba54\ud0c0\ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1 \ubc0f \ucd5c\uadfc\uc758 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \uae30\ubc18 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\ub9c1 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, existing agent benchmarks largely focus on symbolic or weakly grounded environments, leaving their performance in physics-constrained real-world domains underexplored. We introduce AstroReason-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating agentic planning in Space Planning Problems (SPP), a family of high-stakes problems with heterogeneous objectives, strict physical constraints, and long-horizon decision-making. AstroReason-Bench integrates multiple scheduling regimes, including ground station communication and agile Earth observation, and provides a unified agent-oriented interaction protocol. Evaluating on a range of state-of-the-art open- and closed-source agentic LLM systems, we find that current agents substantially underperform specialized solvers, highlighting key limitations of generalist planning under realistic constraints.

Limited resources, however, require careful prioritization of which facilities to upgrade to maximize population coverage while accounting for diverse expert and stakeholder preferences. In collaboration with the Ethiopian Public Health Institute and Ministry of Health, we propose a hybrid framework that systematically integrates expert knowledge with optimization techniques. Classical optimization methods provide theoretical guarantees but require explicit, quantitative objectives, whereas stakeholder criteria are often articulated in natural language and difficult to formalize. To bridge these domains, we develop the Large language model and Extended Greedy (LEG) framework. Our framework combines a provable approximation algorithm for population coverage optimization with LLM-driven iterative refinement that incorporates human-AI alignment to ensure solutions reflect expert qualitative guidance while preserving coverage guarantees. Experiments on real-world data from three Ethiopian regions demonstrate the framework's effectiveness and its potential to inform equitable, data-driven health system planning.", "AI": {"tldr":
