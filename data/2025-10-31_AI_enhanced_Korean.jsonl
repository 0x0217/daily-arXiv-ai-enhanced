Traditional agent-based or deep\nlearning models can reproduce statistical patterns of movement but fail to\ncapture the semantic coherence and causal logic of human behavior. Large\nlanguage models (LLMs) show potential, but struggle to balance creative\nreasoning with strict structural compliance. This study proposes a Hierarchical\nLLM-Agent Framework, termed Narrative-to-Action, that integrates high-level\nnarrative reasoning, mid-level reflective planning, and low-level behavioral\nexecution within a unified cognitive hierarchy. At the macro level, one agent\nis employed as a \"creative writer\" to produce diary-style narratives rich in\nmotivation and context, then uses another agent as a \"structural parser\" to\nconvert narratives into machine-readable plans. A dynamic execution module\nfurther grounds agents in geographic environments and enables adaptive\nbehavioral adjustments guided by a novel occupation-aware metric, Mobility\nEntropy by Occupation (MEO), which captures heterogeneous schedule flexibility\nacross different occupational personalities. At the micro level, the agent\nexecutes concrete actions-selecting locations, transportation modes, and time\nintervals-through interaction with an environmental simulation. By embedding\nthis multi-layer cognitive process, the framework produces not only synthetic\ntrajectories that align closely with real-world patterns but also interpretable\nrepresentations of human decision logic. This research advances synthetic\nmobility generation from a data-driven paradigm to a cognition-driven\nsimulation, providing a scalable pathway for understanding, predicting, and\nsynthesizing complex urban mobility behaviors through hierarchical LLM agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc778\uac04 \uc774\ub3d9\uc131\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0 \ubcf5\uc81c\ud558\uae30

We present the Multi-Agent System\nProcess Reward Model (MASPRM). It assigns per-action, per-agent values to\npartial inter-agent transcripts and acts as an inference-time controller.\nMASPRM is trained from multi-agent Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) rollouts\nwithout requiring step-level human annotations, by propagating returns to local\ntargets. At inference, MASPRM guides step-level beam search and MCTS, focusing\ncomputation on promising branches and pruning early. On GSM8K and MATH,\nMASPRM-guided decoding with an outcome reward model (ORM) applied to the final\nanswer, improves exact match (EM) over a single straight-through MAS pass by\n$+30.7$ and $+22.9$ points, respectively. A MASPRM trained on GSM8K transfers\nzero-shot to MATH without retraining, adding $8.4$ EM points at the same\nbudget. MASPRM is a plug-in value model that estimates per-agent progress and\ncomplements verifier-style decoders, enabling more reliable, compute-aware\nmulti-agent reasoning.

While conceptual modeling languages like\ni* represent trust relationships qualitatively, they lack computational\nmechanisms for analyzing how trust changes with behavioral evidence.\nConversely, computational trust models from multi-agent systems provide\nalgorithmic updating but lack grounding in requirements engineering contexts\nand conceptual models. This technical report bridges this gap by developing a\ncomputational trust model that extends game-theoretic foundations for strategic\ncoopetition with dynamic trust evolution. We introduce trust as a two-layer\nsystem with immediate trust responding to current behavior and reputation\ntracking violation history. Trust evolves through asymmetric updating where\ncooperation builds trust gradually while violations erode it sharply, creating\nhysteresis effects and trust ceilings that constrain relationship recovery. We\ndevelop a structured translation framework enabling requirements engineers to\ninstantiate computational trust models from i* dependency networks and\norganizational contexts. Comprehensive experimental validation across 78,125\nparameter configurations establishes robust emergence of negativity bias,\nhysteresis effects, and cumulative damage amplification. Empirical validation\nusing the Renault-Nissan Alliance case study (1999-2025) achieves 49 out of 60\nvalidation points (81.7%), successfully reproducing documented trust evolution\nacross five distinct relationship phases including crisis and recovery periods.\nThis technical report builds upon its foundational companion work in\narXiv:2510.18802.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uae30\uc220

While\ntraditional IOs have been orchestrated by human operators and relied on\nmanually crafted tactics, agentic AI promises to make campaigns more automated,\nadaptive, and difficult to detect. This work presents the first systematic\nstudy of emergent coordination among generative agents in simulated IO\ncampaigns. Using generative agent-based modeling, we instantiate IO and organic\nagents in a simulated environment and evaluate coordination across operational\nregimes, from simple goal alignment to team knowledge and collective\ndecision-making. As operational regimes become more structured, IO networks\nbecome denser and more clustered, interactions more reciprocal and positive,\nnarratives more homogeneous, amplification more synchronized, and hashtag\nadoption faster and more sustained. Remarkably, simply revealing to agents\nwhich other agents share their goals can produce coordination levels nearly\nequivalent to those achieved through explicit deliberation and collective\nvoting. Overall, we show that generative agents, even without human guidance,\ncan reproduce coordination strategies characteristic of real-world IOs,\nunderscoring the societal risks posed by increasingly automated,\nself-organizing IOs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \uc870\uc815 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \ucd5c\ucd08\ub85c

In this paper, we propose a novel\nthreat model referred to as Med-Hammer that combines the Rowhammer hardware\nfault injection with neural Trojan attacks to compromise the integrity of\nViT-based medical imaging systems. Specifically, we demonstrate how malicious\nbit flips induced via Rowhammer can trigger implanted neural Trojans, leading\nto targeted misclassification or suppression of critical diagnoses (e.g.,\ntumors or lesions) in medical scans. Through extensive experiments on benchmark\nmedical imaging datasets such as ISIC, Brain Tumor, and MedMNIST, we show that\nsuch attacks can remain stealthy while achieving high attack success rates\nabout 82.51% and 92.56% in MobileViT and SwinTransformer, respectively. We\nfurther investigate how architectural properties, such as model sparsity,\nattention weight distribution, and the number of features of the layer, impact\nattack effectiveness.

We present Fortytwo, a\nnovel protocol that leverages swarm intelligence principles and distributed\npairwise ranking consensus to achieve superior performance in AI inference. Our\napproach reimagines collaboration among AI nodes using swarm inference: a\npeer-ranked, reputation-weighted consensus across heterogeneous models that\nsurfaces the highest-quality responses. Using pairwise ranking with a custom\nBradley-Terry-style aggregation model, we demonstrate that swarm inference\nsubstantially outperforms majority voting, achieving 85.90% on GPQA Diamond\nversus 68.69% for majority voting with the same model set - an improvement of\n+17.21 percentage points (approximately +25.1% relative). The protocol\nincorporates on-chain reputation so node influence adapts to demonstrated\naccuracy over time, yielding a meritocratic consensus that filters low-quality\nor malicious participants. To resist Sybil attacks, Fortytwo employs\nproof-of-capability in its consensus: nodes must successfully complete\ncalibration/test requests and stake reputation to enter ranking rounds, making\nmulti-identity attacks economically unattractive while preserving openness.\nAcross six challenging benchmarks, including GPQA Diamond, LiveCodeBench, and\nAIME, our evaluation indicates higher accuracy and strong resilience to\nadversarial and noisy free-form prompting (e.g., prompt-injection degradation\nof only 0.12% versus 6.20% for a monolithic single-model baseline), while\nretaining practical deployability.

However, these models\nremain fragile or entirely incapable when extended to multi-modal tasks.\nExisting approaches largely rely on single-form captions, which lack diversity\nand often fail to adapt across different types of Visual Question Answering\n(VQA) benchmarks. As a result, they provide no principled or efficient channel\nfor transmitting fine-grained visual information. We introduce Seeing Eye, a\nmodular framework that unlocks multimodal reasoning in text-only LLMs through\nan agent-based small VLM translator. This translator acts as a perception\nagent: it can invoke specialized tools (e.g., OCR and crop) and iteratively\ndistill multimodal inputs into structured intermediate representations (SIRs)\ntailored to the question. These SIRs are then passed to the text-only LLM,\nwhich serves as a reasoning agent. Crucially, the translator and reasoner\nengage in multi-round feedback and interaction, enabling the extraction of\ntargeted visual details and yielding more confident answers. Experiments on\nknowledge-intensive VQA benchmarks, including MMMU and MIA-Bench, demonstrate\nthat Seeing Eye not only reduces inference cost but also surpasses much larger\nend-to-end VLMs. For example, an instantiation combining a 3B-parameter vision\ntranslator with an 8B-parameter language reasoner outperforms a monolithic 32B\nVLM on challenging knowledge-based questions. Our results highlight that\ndecoupling perception from reasoning via agent information flow offers a\nscalable and plug-and-play pathway to multimodal reasoning, allowing strong\ntext-only LLMs to fully leverage their reasoning capabilities.

We present an adaptive\nmultitask EEG classifier that converts 32-channel signals to power spectral\ndensity features (Welch), uses a recurrent-convolutional network (GRU-TCN) to\npredict stroke type (healthy, ischemic, hemorrhagic), hemispheric\nlateralization, and severity, and applies a deep Q-network (DQN) to tune\ndecision thresholds in real time. Using a patient-wise split of the UCLH Stroke\nEIT/EEG data set (44 recordings; about 26 acute stroke, 10 controls), the\nprimary outcome was stroke-type performance; secondary outcomes were severity\nand lateralization. The baseline GRU-TCN reached 89.3% accuracy (F1 92.8%) for\nstroke type, about 96.9% (F1 95.9%) for severity, and about 96.7% (F1 97.4%)\nfor lateralization.

Recent work improves KBQA by\nadopting an agentic reasoning paradigm, in which Large Language Models (LLMs)\niteratively decompose a question, generate its corresponding logical queries,\nand interact with the KB to derive the answer. However, these methods typically\nfine-tune LLMs on reasoning trajectories synthesized via process supervision,\nwhich offers weak incentives for exploration and thus fails to strengthen the\nagentic reasoning ability. In this paper, we propose KnowCoder-A1, an LLM that\ncan autonomously perform agentic reasoning on KBs to obtain answers. To\nincentivize autonomous exploration, KnowCoder-A1 trains the LLM under\noutcome-only supervision via a multi-stage curriculum reinforcement learning\nwith an easy-to-hard curriculum. To establish foundational agentic\ncapabilities, KnowCoder-A1 first fine-tunes the LLM on a small set of\nhigh-quality trajectories obtained through outcome-based rejection sampling.\nThen, to alleviate the reward sparsity inherent in outcome-only supervision, it\napplies multi-stage curriculum RL with reward schedules that progress from easy\nto hard. Trained with outcome-only supervision, KnowCoder-A1 exhibits powerful\nreasoning behaviors and consistently outperforms prior approaches across three\nmainstream datasets. Notably, on the zero-shot subset of GrailQA, KnowCoder-A1\nachieves up to an 11.1% relative improvement while using only one-twelfth of\nthe training data, demonstrating strong agentic reasoning capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "KnowCoder-A1\ub294 Knowledge Base\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc5ec \uc9c8\ubb38\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub2f5\uc744 \uc5bb\ub294 LLM\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "KBQA\uc758 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc774 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uace0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "KnowCoder-A1\uc740 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ucee4\ub9ac\ud058\ub7fc \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 LLM\uc744 outcome-only supervision \ud558\uc5d0 \ud6c8\ub828\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "KnowCoder-A1\uc740 Outcome-only supervision\uc73c\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ub418\uc5b4 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, \uc774\uc804 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "KnowCoder-A1\uc740 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 1/12\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec GrailQA\uc758 \uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7 \uc11c\ube0c\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c 11.1%\uc758 \uc0c1\ub300\uc801 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc9c0\uc2dd \uae30\ubc18 \uc9c8\ubb38 \ub2f5\ubcc0(KBQA)\uc740 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc9c0\uc2dd \uae30\ubc18(KB)\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc5d0 \ub2f5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uace0\uc548\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\uace0, \ud574\ub2f9\ud558\ub294 \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801 \ucffc\ub9ac\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uba70, KB\uc640 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub2f5\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \ucc44\ud0dd\ud558\uc5ec KBQA\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \uac10\ub3c5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud569\uc131\ub41c \ucd94\ub860 \uacbd\ub85c\uc5d0\uc11c LLM\uc744 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc57d\ud55c \uc778\uc13c\ud2f0\ube0c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub2f5\uc744 \uc5bb\uae30 \uc704\ud574 KB\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 LLM\uc778 KnowCoder-A1\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc790\uc728 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \uc7a5\ub824\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 KnowCoder-A1\uc740 \uc26c\uc6b4 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub85c \uc9c4\uc804\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ucee4\ub9ac\ud058\ub7fc \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 outcome-only supervision \ud558\uc5d0 LLM\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\ucd08\uc801\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc801 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud655\ub9bd\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 KnowCoder-A1\uc740 \uba3c\uc800 \uacb0\uacfc \uae30\ubc18 \uac70\ubd80 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5bb\uc740 \uc18c\ub7c9\uc758 \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \uacbd\ub85c\uc5d0\uc11c LLM\uc744 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7f0 \ub2e4\uc74c outcome-only supervision\uc5d0 \ub0b4\uc7ac\ub41c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud76c\uc18c\uc131\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\uc774 \uc26c\uc6b4 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub85c \uc9c4\ud589\ub418\ub294 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ucee4\ub9ac\ud058\ub7fc RL\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Due to the extreme complexity of\npost-disaster environments, existing sensing technologies such as mobile\ncrowdsensing suffer from weak environmental adaptability, insufficient\nprofessional sensing capabilities, and poor practicality of sensing solutions.\nTherefore, this paper explores a heterogeneous multi-agent online collaborative\nscheduling algorithm, HoCs-MPQ, to achieve efficient collection of\npost-disaster environmental information. HoCs-MPQ models collaboration and\nconflict relationships among multiple elements through weighted undirected\ngraph construction, and iteratively solves the maximum weight independent set\nbased on multi-priority queues, ultimately achieving collaborative sensing\nscheduling of time-dependent UA Vs, vehicles, and workers. Specifically, (1)\nHoCs-MPQ constructs weighted undirected graph nodes based on collaborative\nrelationships among multiple elements and quantifies their weights, then models\nthe weighted undirected graph based on conflict relationships between nodes;\n(2) HoCs-MPQ solves the maximum weight independent set based on iterated local\nsearch, and accelerates the solution process using multi-priority queues.\nFinally, we conducted detailed experiments based on extensive real-world and\nsimulated data. The experiments show that, compared to baseline methods (e.g.,\nHoCs-GREEDY, HoCs-K-WTA, HoCs-MADL, and HoCs-MARL), HoCs-MPQ improves task\ncompletion rates by an average of 54.13%, 23.82%, 14.12%, and 12.89%\nrespectively, with computation time for single online autonomous scheduling\ndecisions not exceeding 3 seconds.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc7ac\ub09c \ud6c4 \ud658\uacbd \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\uc9d1\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 heterogeneous multi-agent \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ud611\uc5c5 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\ub9c1 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc778 HoCs-MPQ\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud0dc\uc2a4\ud06c \uc644\ub8cc\uc728\uc744 \ud3c9\uade0 54% \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf30\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ube48\ubc88\ud55c \uc790\uc5f0\uc7ac\ud574\ub294 \uc778\ub958 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc5d0 \ud070 \uc190\uc2e4\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud558\uba70, \uc7ac\ub09c \ud6c4 \ud658\uacbd \uc815\ubcf4\uc758 \uc2e0\uc18d\ud558\uace0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc218\uc9d1\uc774 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uad6c\uc870 \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \uae30\ucd08\uac00 \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "HoCs-MPQ\ub294 \uac00\uc911\uce58\uac00 \ubd80\uc5ec\ub41c \ubb34\ubc29\ud5a5 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e4\uc218 \uc694\uc18c \uac04\uc758 \ud611\uc5c5\uacfc \uac08\ub4f1 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uace0, \ub2e4\uc911 \uc6b0\uc120 \ud050\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ucd5c\ub300 \uac00\uc911 \ub3c5\ub9bd \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uc5ec \uc2dc\uac04 \uc758\uc874\uc801 UA V, \ucc28\ub7c9 \ubc0f \uc791\uc5c5\uc790\uc758 \ud611\uc870\uc801 \uc13c\uc2f1 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\ub9c1\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "HoCs-MPQ\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ud3c9\uade0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud0dc\uc2a4\ud06c \uc644\ub8cc\uc728\uc744 \uac01\uac01 54.13%, 23.82%, 14.12%, 12.89% \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba70, \ub2e8\uc77c \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uc790\uc728 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\ub9c1 \uacb0\uc815\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc2dc\uac04\uc740 3\ucd08\ub97c \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub514\ud14c\uc77c\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc HoCs-MPQ\ub294 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc7ac\ub09c \ud6c4 \ud658\uacbd \uc815\ubcf4 \uc218\uc9d1\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud568\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ube48\ubc88\ud55c \uc790\uc5f0\uc7ac\ud574\ub294 \uc778\ub958 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc5d0 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc190\uc2e4\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud558\uba70, \uc7ac\ub09c \ud6c4 \ud658\uacbd \uc815\ubcf4\uc758 \uc2dc\uae30\uc801\uc808\ud558\uace0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc218\uc9d1\uc740 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uad6c\uc870 \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \uae30\ucd08\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc7ac\ub09c \ud6c4 \ud658\uacbd\uc758 \uadf9\ub3c4\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c \ud06c\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc \uc13c\uc2f1\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uae30\uc874 \uac10\uc9c0 \uae30\uc220\uc740 \ud658\uacbd \uc801\uc751\uc131\uc774 \uc57d\ud558\uace0, \uc804\ubb38 \uac10\uc9c0 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \ubd88\ucda9\ubd84\ud558\uba70, \uac10\uc9c0 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc758 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc131\uc774 \ub5a8\uc5b4\uc9d1\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc7ac\ub09c \ud6c4 \ud658\uacbd \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\uc9d1\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc774\uc885 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ud611\uc5c5 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\ub9c1 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc778 HoCs-MPQ\ub97c \ud0d0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Despite its theoretical\nappeal, the practical implementation of HRL suffers from the challenge of\nautonomously discovering semantically meaningful subgoals and learning optimal\noption termination boundaries. This paper introduces a novel architecture that\nintegrates a self-supervised, Transformer-based Change Point Detection (CPD)\nmodule into the Option-Critic framework, enabling adaptive segmentation of\nstate trajectories and the discovery of options. The CPD module is trained\nusing heuristic pseudo-labels derived from intrinsic signals to infer latent\nshifts in environment dynamics without external supervision. These inferred\nchange-points are leveraged in three critical ways: (i) to serve as supervisory\nsignals for stabilizing termination function gradients, (ii) to pretrain\nintra-option policies via segment-wise behavioral cloning, and (iii) to enforce\nfunctional specialization through inter-option divergence penalties over\nCPD-defined state partitions. The overall optimization objective enhances the\nstandard actor-critic loss using structure-aware auxiliary losses. In our\nframework, option discovery arises naturally as CPD-defined trajectory segments\nare mapped to distinct intra-option policies, enabling the agent to\nautonomously partition its behavior into reusable, semantically meaningful\nskills.

We extend this paradigm to\nsafety alignment by introducing Agentic Moderation, a model-agnostic framework\nthat leverages specialised agents to defend multimodal systems against\njailbreak attacks. Unlike prior approaches that apply as a static layer over\ninputs or outputs and provide only binary classifications (safe or unsafe), our\nmethod integrates dynamic, cooperative agents, including Shield, Responder,\nEvaluator, and Reflector, to achieve context-aware and interpretable\nmoderation. Extensive experiments across five datasets and four representative\nLarge Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate that our approach reduces the\nAttack Success Rate (ASR) by 7-19%, maintains a stable Non-Following Rate (NF),\nand improves the Refusal Rate (RR) by 4-20%, achieving robust, interpretable,\nand well-balanced safety performance.

This study systematically\ninvestigates the robustness of radiomics-based machine learning models under\ndistribution shifts across five MRI sequences. We evaluated how different\nacquisition protocols and segmentation strategies affect model reliability in\nterms of predictive power and uncertainty-awareness. Using a phantom of 16\nfruits, we evaluated distribution shifts through: (1) protocol variations\nacross T2-HASTE, T2-TSE, T2-MAP, T1-TSE, and T2-FLAIR sequences; (2)\nsegmentation variations (full, partial, rotated); and (3) inter-observer\nvariability. We trained XGBoost classifiers on 8 consistent robust features\nversus sequence-specific features, testing model performance under in-domain\nand out-of-domain conditions. Results demonstrate that models trained on\nprotocol-invariant features maintain F1-scores >0.85 across distribution\nshifts, while models using all features showed 40% performance degradation\nunder protocol changes.

However,\nthe complexity and heterogeneity of industrial event logs--characterized by\nlarge scale, high dimensionality, diverse data types, and intricate temporal or\nrelational structures--make feature engineering extremely challenging. Existing\nautomatic feature engineering approaches, such as AutoML or genetic methods,\noften suffer from limited explainability, rigid predefined operations, and poor\nadaptability to complicated heterogeneous data. In this paper, we propose FELA\n(Feature Engineering LLM Agents), a multi-agent evolutionary system that\nautonomously extracts meaningful and high-performing features from complex\nindustrial event log data. FELA integrates the reasoning and coding\ncapabilities of large language models (LLMs) with an insight-guided\nself-evolution paradigm. Specifically, FELA employs specialized agents--Idea\nAgents, Code Agents, and Critic Agents--to collaboratively generate, validate,\nand implement novel feature ideas. An Evaluation Agent summarizes feedback and\nupdates a hierarchical knowledge base and dual-memory system to enable\ncontinual improvement. Moreover, FELA introduces an agentic evolution\nalgorithm, combining reinforcement learning and genetic algorithm principles to\nbalance exploration and exploitation across the idea space.

To address this, we develop a\nnovel approach integrating synthetic patient electronic medical record (EMR)\nconstruction and multi-agent diagnostic dialogue generation. We create 502\nsynthetic EMRs for common comorbid conditions using a pipeline that ensures\nclinical relevance and diversity. Our multi-agent framework transfers the\nclinical interview protocol into a hierarchical state machine and context tree,\nsupporting over 130 diagnostic states while maintaining clinical standards.\nThrough this rigorous process, we construct PsyCoTalk, the first large-scale\ndialogue dataset supporting comorbidity, containing 3,000 multi-turn diagnostic\ndialogues validated by psychiatrists. This dataset enhances diagnostic accuracy\nand treatment planning, offering a valuable resource for psychiatric\ncomorbidity research.

The prevailing DL paradigm\nuniformly optimizes all timesteps through the MSE loss and learns those\nuncertain and anomalous timesteps without difference, ultimately resulting in\noverfitting. To address this, we propose a novel selective learning strategy\nfor deep TSF. Specifically, selective learning screens a subset of the whole\ntimesteps to calculate the MSE loss in optimization, guiding the model to focus\non generalizable timesteps while disregarding non-generalizable ones. Our\nframework introduces a dual-mask mechanism to target timesteps: (1) an\nuncertainty mask leveraging residual entropy to filter uncertain timesteps, and\n(2) an anomaly mask employing residual lower bound estimation to exclude\nanomalous timesteps. Extensive experiments across eight real-world datasets\ndemonstrate that selective learning can significantly improve the predictive\nperformance for typical state-of-the-art deep models, including 37.4% MSE\nreduction for Informer, 8.4% for TimesNet, and 6.5% for iTransformer.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd\uc758 \uc120\ud0dd\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc608\uce21\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4\uc740 \ub178\uc774\uc988\uc640 \uc774\uc0c1\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \ub525 \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uc774 \uacfc\uc801\ud569\ub418\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc120\ud0dd\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc804\ub7b5\uc740 \uc804\uccb4 \ud0c0\uc784\uc2a4\ud15d \uc911 \uc77c\ubd80\ub97c \ud544\ud130\ub9c1\ud558\uc5ec MSE \uc190\uc2e4\uc744 \uacc4\uc0b0\ud558\uace0, \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud0c0\uc784\uc2a4\ud15d\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "8\uac1c\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc120\ud0dd\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 Informer\uc5d0\uc11c MSE 37.4%, TimesNet\uc5d0\uc11c 8.4%, iTransformer\uc5d0\uc11c 6.5% \uac10\uc18c\ub97c \uc2dc\ucf1c \uc608\uce21 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc774\uc911 \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud06c \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc740 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uacfc \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0c0\uc784\uc2a4\ud15d\uc744 \ud544\ud130\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc2dc\uac04 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \ub192\uc740 \uc6a9\ub7c9\uc758 \uc774\uc810\uc744 \ub204\ub9ac\uba74\uc11c, \ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd(DL)\uc740 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc608\uce21(TSF)\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ubc1c\uc804\uc2dc\ucf30\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ub525 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4\uc774 \ub178\uc774\uc988\uc640 \uc774\uc0c1\uc5d0 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \uacfc\uc801\ud569 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uacaa\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 DL \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc740 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ud0c0\uc784\uc2a4\ud15d\uc744 MSE \uc190\uc2e4\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uade0\uc77c\ud558\uac8c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uace0 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud558\uace0 \uc774\uc0c1\ud55c \ud0c0\uc784\uc2a4\ud15d\uc744 \uad6c\ubd84 \uc5c6\uc774 \ud559\uc2b5\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uacb0\uad6d \uacfc\uc801\ud569\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub525 TSF\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc120\ud0dd\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc120\ud0dd\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc5d0\uc11c MSE \uc190\uc2e4\uc744 \uacc4\uc0b0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc804\uccb4 \ud0c0\uc784\uc2a4\ud15d\uc758 \ud558\uc704 \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \uc2a4\ud06c\ub9ac\ub2dd\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud0c0\uc784\uc2a4\ud15d\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\ud558\uace0 \ube44\uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uac83\ub4e4\uc740 \ubb34\uc2dc\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc548\ub0b4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ud0c0\uac9f \ud0c0\uc784\uc2a4\ud15d\uc744 \uaca8\ub0e5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc774\uc911 \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud06c \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: (1) \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud06c\ub294 \uc794\uc5ec \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud55c \ud0c0\uc784\uc2a4\ud15d\uc744 \ud544\ud130\ub9c1\ud558\uace0, (2) \uc774\uc0c1 \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud06c\ub294 \uc794\uc5ec \ud558\ud55c \ucd94\uc815\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0c0\uc784\uc2a4\ud15d\uc744 \ubc30\uc81c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. 8\uac1c\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc740 \uc120\ud0dd\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5\uc774 Informer\uc5d0\uc11c 37.4%, TimesNet\uc5d0\uc11c 8.4%, iTransformer\uc5d0\uc11c 6.5%\uc758 MSE \uac10\uc18c\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uc5ec \uc804\ud615\uc801\uc778 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ub525 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc608\uce21 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However,\nexisting paradigms such as ReAct rely on sequential reasoning and execution,\nfailing to exploit the inherent parallelism among independent sub-tasks. This\nsequential bottleneck leads to inefficient tool utilization and suboptimal\nperformance in multi-step reasoning scenarios. We introduce Graph-based Agent\nPlanning (GAP), a novel framework that explicitly models inter-task\ndependencies through graph-based planning to enable adaptive parallel and\nserial tool execution. Our approach trains agent foundation models to decompose\ncomplex tasks into dependency-aware sub-task graphs, autonomously determining\nwhich tools can be executed in parallel and which must follow sequential\ndependencies. This dependency-aware orchestration achieves substantial\nimprovements in both execution efficiency and task accuracy. To train GAP, we\nconstruct a high-quality dataset of graph-based planning traces derived from\nthe Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) benchmark. We employ a two-stage\ntraining strategy: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the curated dataset,\nfollowed by reinforcement learning (RL) with a correctness-based reward\nfunction on strategically sampled queries where tool-based reasoning provides\nmaximum value. Experimental results on MHQA datasets demonstrate that GAP\nsignificantly outperforms traditional ReAct baselines, particularly on\nmulti-step retrieval tasks, while achieving dramatic improvements in tool\ninvocation efficiency through intelligent parallelization.

In contrast, updates in the orthogonal component (Bulk-space) have\nsmaller magnitudes but drive most learning progress. In this work, we further\nadvance the understanding of this phenomenon and introduce the\n\\textbf{Bulk-Space-Filtration-Accelerator (BSFA)}, a novel plug-and-play\nframework. BSFA accelerates training by differentially scaling update\ncomponents projected onto these distinct subspaces, simultaneously enhancing\nstability by moderating updates in the dominant subspace and boosting\nconvergence speed by amplifying those in the bulk-space. To ensure BSFA is both\npractical and scalable for contemporary large models, we introduce two key\ninnovations: an efficient estimator using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on\nhistorical updates for fast subspace estimation, and a block-wise strategy that\napplies this estimation on a per-parameter-block basis. These designs make BSFA\ncomputationally tractable and highly effective.

This survey cuts through this confusion by introducing\na novel dual-paradigm framework that categorizes agentic systems into two\ndistinct lineages: the Symbolic/Classical (relying on algorithmic planning and\npersistent state) and the Neural/Generative (leveraging stochastic generation\nand prompt-driven orchestration). Through a systematic PRISMA-based review of\n90 studies (2018--2025), we provide a comprehensive analysis structured around\nthis framework across three dimensions: (1) the theoretical foundations and\narchitectural principles defining each paradigm; (2) domain-specific\nimplementations in healthcare, finance, and robotics, demonstrating how\napplication constraints dictate paradigm selection; and (3) paradigm-specific\nethical and governance challenges, revealing divergent risks and mitigation\nstrategies. Our analysis reveals that the choice of paradigm is strategic:\nsymbolic systems dominate safety-critical domains (e.g., healthcare), while\nneural systems prevail in adaptive, data-rich environments (e.g., finance).\nFurthermore, we identify critical research gaps, including a significant\ndeficit in governance models for symbolic systems and a pressing need for\nhybrid neuro-symbolic architectures.

As a result, the learned policy can exploit one\nor few reward sources. However, in many natural situations, it is desirable to\nlearn a policy that induces a dispersed marginal state distribution over\nrewarding states, while maximizing the expected return which is typically tied\nto reaching a goal state. This aspect remains relatively unexplored. Existing\ntechniques based on entropy regularization and intrinsic rewards use\nstochasticity for encouraging exploration to find an optimal policy which may\nnot necessarily lead to dispersed marginal state distribution over rewarding\nstates. Other RL algorithms which match a target distribution assume the latter\nto be available apriori. This may be infeasible in large scale systems where\nenumeration of all states is not possible and a state is determined to be a\ngoal state only upon reaching it. We formalize the problem of maximizing the\nexpected return while uniformly visiting the goal states as Multi Goal RL in\nwhich an oracle classifier over the state space determines the goal states. We\npropose a novel algorithm that learns a high-return policy mixture with\nmarginal state distribution dispersed over the set of goal states. Our\nalgorithm is based on optimizing a custom RL reward which is computed - based\non the current policy mixture - at each iteration for a set of sampled\ntrajectories. The latter are used via an offline RL algorithm to update the\npolicy mixture. We prove performance guarantees for our algorithm, showing\nefficient convergence bounds for optimizing a natural objective which captures\nthe expected return as well as the dispersion of the marginal state\ndistribution over the goal states. We design and perform experiments on\nsynthetic MDPs and standard RL environments to evaluate the effectiveness of\nour algorithm.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubaa9\ud45c

These goals, which include tendencies such\nas power-seeking and self-preservation, become problematic when they conflict\nwith human aims. Conventional alignment theory treats instrumental goals as\nsources of risk that become problematic through failure modes such as reward\nhacking or goal misgeneralization, and attempts to limit the symptoms of\ninstrumental goals, notably resource acquisition and self-preservation. This\narticle proposes an alternative framing: that a philosophical argument can be\nconstructed according to which instrumental goals may be understood as features\nto be accepted and managed rather than failures to be limited. Drawing on\nAristotle's ontology and its modern interpretations, an ontology of concrete,\ngoal-directed entities, it argues that advanced AI systems can be seen as\nartifacts whose formal and material constitution gives rise to effects distinct\nfrom their designers' intentions. In this view, the instrumental tendencies of\nsuch systems correspond to per se outcomes of their constitution rather than\naccidental malfunctions. The implication is that efforts should focus less on\neliminating instrumental goals and more on understanding, managing, and\ndirecting them toward human-aligned ends.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5(AI) \uc815\ub82c \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub3c4\uad6c\uc801 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \ub3c4\uad6c\uc801 \ubaa9\ud45c\uac00 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucdb0 \uc870\uc815\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\uc548\uc744 \ub17c\uc758\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc801 \ubaa9\ud45c\uac00 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc640 \ucda9\ub3cc\ud560 \ub54c \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc5b4, \uc774\ub97c \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ub2e4\ub8f0 \uac83\uc778\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uad00\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc544\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud1a0\ud154\ub808\uc2a4\uc758 \uc874\uc7ac\ub860\uacfc \ud604\ub300 \ud574\uc11d\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uace0\uc720\ud55c \ubaa9\ud45c \uc9c0\ud5a5\uc801 \uc874\uc7ac\ub4e4\ub85c\uc11c\uc758 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc801 \uc131\ud5a5\uc774 \uc6b0\uc5f0\ud55c \uae30\ub2a5 \uc7a5\uc560\uc640\ub294 \ub2ec\ub9ac \uadf8 \uc790\uccb4\uc758 \uad6c\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \ube44\ub86f\ub41c \uacb0\uacfc\uc784\uc744 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub530\ub77c\uc11c \ub3c4\uad6c\uc801 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uc81c\uac70\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc9d1\uc911\ud558\uae30\ubcf4\ub2e4, \uc774\ub97c \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0 \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\uba70 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \ubaa9\uc801\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucd94\uc5b4 \uc774\ub044\ub294 \ub370 \ub178\ub825\uc744 \uae30\uc6b8\uc5ec\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5(AI) \uc815\ub82c \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub3c4\uad6c\uc801 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub294 \uace0\uae09 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uacfc \ub110\ub9ac \uc5f0\uad00\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub4e4\uc740 \uad8c\ub825 \ucd94\uad6c \ubc0f \uc790\uae30 \ubcf4\uc874\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubaa9\ud45c\ub294 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc640 \ucda9\ub3cc\ud560 \ub54c \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc815\ub82c \uc774\ub860\uc740 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc801 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud574\ud0b9\uc774\ub098 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc758 \uc624\uc77c\ubc18\ud654\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc2e4\ud328 \ubaa8\ub4dc\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc704\ud5d8\uc758 \uc6d0\ucc9c\uc73c\ub85c \uac04\uc8fc\ud558\uba70, \uc790\uc6d0 \ud655\ubcf4 \ubc0f \uc790\uae30 \ubcf4\uc874\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc99d\uc0c1\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud558\ub824\uace0 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uae30\uc0ac\ub294 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc801 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uc81c\ud55c\ud560 \uc2e4\ud328\uac00 \uc544\ub2cc \ubc1b\uc544\ub4e4\uc774\uace0 \uad00\ub9ac\ud574\uc57c \ud560 \ud2b9\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\ud574\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ucca0\ud559\uc801 \uc8fc\uc7a5\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc544\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud1a0\ud154\ub808\uc2a4\uc758 \uc874\uc7ac\ub860\uacfc \ud604\ub300 \ud574\uc11d\uc744 \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c, \uace0\uae09 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ub514\uc790\uc774\ub108\uc758 \uc758\ub3c4\uc640\ub294 \ub2e4\ub978 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \ub0b3\ub294 \uc778\uacf5\ubb3c\ub85c \uac04\uc8fc\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc801 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc740 \uadf8 \uad6c\uc131\uc758 \ubcf8\ub798 \uacb0\uacfc\uc5d0 \ud574\ub2f9\ud558\uba70, \uc6b0\uc5f0\ud55c \uc624\uc791\ub3d9\uc774 \uc544\ub2d9\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc801 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uc81c\uac70\ud558\uae30\ubcf4\ub2e4\ub294 \uc774\ub97c \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0 \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\uba70 \uc778\uac04\uc5d0 \uc815\ub82c\ub41c \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud5a5\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \uc124\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc9d1\uc911\ud574\uc57c \ud568\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

A key challenge is\nto design linear layers that enhance expressiveness while maintaining efficient\ncomputation of the Jacobian determinant and inverse. We introduce a novel\ninvertible linear layer based on the product of circulant and diagonal\nmatrices. This decomposition reduces parameter complexity from\n$\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(mn)$ using $m$ diagonal matrices and $m-1$\ncirculant matrices while still approximating general linear transformations. By\nleveraging the Fast Fourier Transform, our approach reduces the time complexity\nof matrix inversion from $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(mn\\log n)$ and that\nof computing the log-determinant from $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(mn)$,\nwhere $n$ is the input dimension.

This has also prompted the adoption of ensemble learning for the\nknowledge graph embedding (KGE) models in performing link prediction. Typical\napproaches to this end train multiple models as part of the ensemble, and the\ndiverse predictions are then averaged. However, this approach has some\nsignificant drawbacks. For instance, the computational overhead of training\nmultiple models increases latency and memory overhead. In contrast, model\nmerging approaches offer a promising alternative that does not require training\nmultiple models. In this work, we introduce model merging, specifically\nweighted averaging, in KGE models. Herein, a running average of model\nparameters from a training epoch onward is maintained and used for predictions.\nTo address this, we additionally propose an approach that selectively updates\nthe running average of the ensemble model parameters only when the\ngeneralization performance improves on a validation dataset. We evaluate these\ntwo different weighted averaging approaches on link prediction tasks, comparing\nthe state-of-the-art benchmark ensemble approach. Additionally, we evaluate the\nweighted averaging approach considering literal-augmented KGE models and\nmulti-hop query answering tasks as well.

Existing exploration methods\ngenerally fall into two categories: active exploration and passive exploration.\nThe former introduces stochasticity into the policy but struggles in\nhigh-dimensional environments, while the latter adaptively prioritizes\ntransitions in the replay buffer to enhance exploration, yet remains\nconstrained by limited sample diversity. To address the limitation in passive\nexploration, we propose Modelic Generative Exploration (MoGE), which augments\nexploration through the generation of under-explored critical states and\nsynthesis of dynamics-consistent experiences through transition models. MoGE is\ncomposed of two components: (1) a diffusion-based generator that synthesizes\ncritical states under the guidance of a utility function evaluating each\nstate's potential influence on policy exploration, and (2) a one-step\nimagination world model for constructing critical transitions based on the\ncritical states for agent learning. Our method adopts a modular formulation\nthat aligns with the principles of off-policy learning, allowing seamless\nintegration with existing algorithms to improve exploration without altering\ntheir core structures. Empirical results on OpenAI Gym and DeepMind Control\nSuite reveal that MoGE effectively bridges exploration and policy learning,\nleading to remarkable gains in both sample efficiency and performance across\ncomplex control tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "MoGE\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud0d0\ud5d8 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ube44\ud65c\uc131 \ud0d0\ud5d8\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud0d0\ud5d8\ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud0d0\ud5d8\uc740 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\uba70, \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud658\uacbd\uc758 \uae30\ubcf8 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uace0 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uacb0\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uc720\ud2f8\ub9ac\ud2f0 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \ud569\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ud655\uc0b0 \uae30\ubc18 \uc0dd\uc131\uae30\uc640 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc804\uc774 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\ub294 \ub2e8\uc77c \ub2e8\uacc4 \uc0c1\uc0c1 \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c MoGE\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, MoGE\ub294 \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc8fc\ubaa9\ud560 \ub9cc\ud55c \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uae30\uc874 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uacfc\uc758 \uc6d0\ud65c\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud0d0\ud5d8\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud0d0\ud5d8\uc740 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec\uc774\uba70, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud658\uacbd\uc758 \uae30\ubcf8 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uace0 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uacb0\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud0d0\ud5d8 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801 \ud0d0\ud5d8\uacfc \uc218\ub3d9\uc801 \ud0d0\ud5d8 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0\ub85c \ubd84\ub958\ub41c\ub2e4. \uc804\uc790\ub294 \uc815\ucc45\uc5d0 \ud655\ub960\uc131\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0, \ud6c4\uc790\ub294 \ud0d0\ud5d8\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc7ac\uc2e4\ud589 \ubc84\ud37c\uc758 \uc804\uc774\ub97c \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b0\uc120\uc21c\uc704\ud654\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc0d8\ud50c \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ubc1b\ub294\ub2e4. \uc218\ub3d9\uc801 \ud0d0\ud5d8\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud0d0\ud5d8\uc744 \uc99d\ub300\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uac70\uc758 \ud0d0\ud5d8\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uc911\uc694 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uc804\uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5ed\ud559 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 \uac16\ub294 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc744 \ud569\uc131\ud558\ub294 Modelic Generative Exploration (MoGE)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

This\nsubjective process can lead to variability in diagnoses across clinicians and\npatients, resulting in inconsistencies and challenges in achieving reliable\noutcomes. To address these issues and standardize psychiatric diagnoses, we\npropose a Fine-Tuned Large Language Model (LLM) Consortium and OpenAI-gpt-oss\nReasoning LLM-enabled Decision Support System for the clinical diagnosis of\nmental disorders. Our approach leverages fine-tuned LLMs trained on\nconversational datasets involving psychiatrist-patient interactions focused on\nmental health conditions (e.g., depression). The diagnostic predictions from\nindividual models are aggregated through a consensus-based decision-making\nprocess, refined by the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM. We propose a novel method\nfor deploying LLM agents that orchestrate communication between the LLM\nconsortium and the reasoning LLM, ensuring transparency, reliability, and\nresponsible AI across the entire diagnostic workflow. Experimental results\ndemonstrate the transformative potential of combining fine-tuned LLMs with a\nreasoning model to create a robust and highly accurate diagnostic system for\nmental health assessment. A prototype of the proposed platform, integrating\nthree fine-tuned LLMs with the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM, was developed in\ncollaboration with the U.S. Army Medical Research Team in Norfolk, Virginia,\nUSA. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first application\nof a fine-tuned LLM consortium integrated with a reasoning LLM for clinical\nmental health diagnosis paving the way for

Recently,\ntransformer-based models leveraging the attention mechanism have demonstrated\nstrong empirical success in capturing complex dependencies within graphs.\nHowever, the theoretical understanding of their training dynamics has been\nlimited to tree-like graphs, where each node depends on a single parent.\nExtending provable guarantees to more general directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) --\nwhich involve multiple parents per node -- remains challenging, primarily due\nto the difficulty in designing training objectives that enable different\nattention heads to separately learn multiple different parent relationships.\n  In this work, we address this problem by introducing a novel\ninformation-theoretic metric: the kernel-guided mutual information (KG-MI),\nbased on the $f$-divergence. Our objective combines KG-MI with a multi-head\nattention framework, where each head is associated with a distinct marginal\ntransition kernel to model diverse parent-child dependencies effectively. We\nprove that, given sequences generated by a $K$-parent DAG, training a\nsingle-layer, multi-head transformer via gradient ascent converges to the\nglobal optimum in polynomial time. Furthermore, we characterize the attention\nscore patterns at convergence. In addition, when particularizing the\n$f$-divergence to the KL divergence, the learned attention scores accurately\nreflect the ground-truth adjacency matrix, thereby provably recovering the\nunderlying graph structure. Experimental results validate our theoretical\nfindings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ubd80\ubaa8-\uc790\uc2dd \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c

Traditional ocean forecasting relies on numerical models;\nhowever, these approaches face limitations in terms of computational cost and\nscalability. In this study, we adapt Aurora, a foundational deep learning model\noriginally designed for atmospheric forecasting, to predict sea surface\ntemperature (SST) in the Canary Upwelling System. By fine-tuning this model\nwith high-resolution oceanographic reanalysis data, we demonstrate its ability\nto capture complex spatiotemporal patterns while reducing computational\ndemands. Our methodology involves a staged fine-tuning process, incorporating\nlatitude-weighted error metrics and optimizing hyperparameters for efficient\nlearning. The experimental results show that the model achieves a low RMSE of\n0.119K, maintaining high anomaly correlation coefficients (ACC $\\approx\n0.997$). The model successfully reproduces large-scale SST structures but faces\nchallenges in capturing finer details in coastal regions. This work contributes\nto the field of data-driven ocean forecasting by demonstrating the feasibility\nof using deep learning models pre-trained in different domains for oceanic\napplications. Future improvements include integrating additional oceanographic\nvariables, increasing spatial resolution, and exploring physics-informed neural\nnetworks to enhance interpretability and understanding. These advancements can\nimprove climate modeling and ocean prediction accuracy, supporting\ndecision-making in environmental and economic sectors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc2ec\uce35 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uce74\ub098\ub9ac\uc544 \uc0c1\uc2b9 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud574\uc218\uba74 \uc628\ub3c4\ub97c \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uae30\ud6c4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uacfc \ud574\uc591 \uc608\uce21\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc815\ud655\ud55c \ud574\uc591 \ubcc0\uc218 \uc608\uce21\uc740 \uae30\ud6c4 \ubcc0\ud654 \uc774\ud574, \ud574\uc591 \uc790\uc6d0 \uad00\ub9ac \ubc0f \ud574\uc591 \ud65c\ub3d9 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uae30\uc0c1 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 Aurora \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uac1c\uc870\ud558\uc5ec \ud574\uc591 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c SST\ub97c \uc608\uce21\ud558\uace0, \uace0\ud574\uc0c1\ub3c4 \ud574\uc591 \uc7ac\ubd84\uc11d \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\ubaa8\ub378\uc740 0.119K\uc758 \ub0ae\uc740 RMSE\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0, \ub192\uc740 \uc774\uc0c1\uce58 \uc0c1\uad00\uacc4\uc218(ACC \uc57d 0.997)\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uae30\ud6c4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uacfc \ud574\uc591 \uc608\uce21\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uace0, \ud658\uacbd \ubc0f \uacbd\uc81c \ubd80\ubb38\uc758 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud574\uc591 \ubcc0\uc218\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc608\uce21\uc740 \uae30\ud6c4 \ubcc0\ud654 \uc774\ud574, \ud574\uc591 \uc790\uc6d0 \uad00\ub9ac \ubc0f \ud574\uc591 \ud65c\ub3d9 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ud574\uc591 \uc608\uce21\uc740 \uc218\uce58 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub098, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uacfc \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uacaa\ub294\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub300\uae30 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uae30\ubcf8 \uc2ec\uce35 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc778 Aurora\ub97c \uce74\ub098\ub9ac\uc544 \uc0c1\uc2b9 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud574\uc218\uba74 \uc628\ub3c4(SST)\ub97c \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uace0, \uace0\ud574\uc0c1\ub3c4 \ud574\uc591 \uc7ac\ubd84\uc11d \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc2dc\uacf5\uac04 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc740 \uc704\ub3c4 \uac00\uc911 \uc624\ucc28 \uc9c0\ud45c\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uace0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130\ub97c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub2e8\uacc4\ubcc4 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 0.119K\uc758 \ub0ae\uc740 RMSE\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0, \ub192\uc740 \uc774\uc0c1\uce58 \uc0c1\uad00\uacc4\uc218(ACC \u2248 0.997)\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 SST \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc7ac\ud604\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc5f0\uc548 \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c \uc138\ubd80 \uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \ubbf8\ub9ac \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ub525 \ub7ec\ub2dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud574\uc591\uc801\uc751\uc5d0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18 \ud574\uc591 \uc608\uce21 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ud5a5\ud6c4 \uac1c\uc120 \uc0ac\ud56d\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\uac00 \ud574\uc591 \ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uace0, \uacf5\uac04 \ud574\uc0c1\ub3c4\ub97c \ub192\uc774\uba70, \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uacfc \uc774\ud574\ub3c4\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubb3c\ub9ac \uae30\ubc18 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud560 \uc608\uc815\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \uae30\ud6c4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \ubc0f \ud574\uc591 \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf1c \ud658\uacbd \ubc0f \uacbd\uc81c \ubd80\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4."}}

Existing approaches\ntypically rely on fixed reasoning templates or rigid pipelines, which force\nVLMs into a passive role and hinder both efficiency and generalization. We\npresent Active Long-DocumEnt Navigation (ALDEN), a multi-turn reinforcement\nlearning framework that fine-tunes VLMs as interactive agents capable of\nactively navigating long, visually rich documents. ALDEN introduces a novel\nfetch action that directly accesses the page by index, complementing the\nclassic search action and better exploiting document structure. For dense\nprocess supervision and efficient training, we propose a rule-based cross-level\nreward that provides both turn- and token-level signals. To address the\nempirically observed training instability caused by numerous visual tokens from\nlong documents, we further propose a visual-semantic anchoring mechanism that\napplies a dual-path KL-divergence constraint to stabilize visual and textual\nrepresentations separately during training.

Yet when these VLMs\nare adapted to the action modality, it remains unclear to what extent their\noriginal VL representations and knowledge are preserved. In this work, we\nconduct a systematic study of representation retention during VLA fine-tuning,\nshowing that naive action fine-tuning leads to degradation of visual\nrepresentations. To characterize and measure these effects, we probe VLA's\nhidden representations and analyze attention maps, further, we design a set of\ntargeted tasks and methods that contrast VLA models with their counterpart\nVLMs, isolating changes in VL capabilities induced by action fine-tuning. We\nfurther evaluate a range of strategies for aligning visual representations and\nintroduce a simple yet effective method that mitigates degradation and yields\nimproved generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Taken together,\nour analysis clarifies the trade-off between action fine-tuning and the\ndegradation of VL representations and highlights practical approaches to\nrecover inherited VL capabilities.

In this work, we develop an optimal\nnavigation strategy based on Deep Reinforcement Learning. The environment is\nrepresented by a three-dimensional high-fidelity simulation of an urban flow,\ncharacterized by turbulence and recirculation zones. The algorithm presented\nhere is a flow-aware Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) combined with a Gated\nTransformer eXtra Large (GTrXL) architecture, giving the agent richer\ninformation about the turbulent flow field in which it navigates. The results\nare compared with a PPO+GTrXL without the secondary prediction tasks, a PPO\ncombined with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) cells and a traditional navigation\nalgorithm. The obtained results show a significant increase in the success rate\n(SR) and a lower crash rate (CR) compared to a PPO+LSTM, PPO+GTrXL and the\nclassical Zermelo's navigation algorithm, paving the way to a completely\nreimagined UAV landscape in complex urban environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub3c4\uc2dc \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 UAV \ucd5c\uc801 \ud56d\ubc95 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc5ec \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \ucda9\ub3cc\uc728\uc744 \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub3c4\uc2dc \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubc30\ub2ec \ubc0f \uac10\uc2dc\ub97c \uc704\ud55c UAV\uc758 \uc99d\uac00\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ucd5c\uc801 \ud56d\ubc95 \uc804\ub7b5\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \ub300\ub450\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 Deep Reinforcement Learning\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \ud56d\ubc95 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \ud750\ub984 \uc778\uc2dd Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)\uacfc Gated Transformer eXtra Large (GTrXL) \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "PPO+LSTM, PPO+GTrXL \ubc0f \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ud56d\ubc95 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec, \uc131\uacf5\ub960(SR)\uc774 \uc720\uc758\ubbf8\ud558\uac8c \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \ucda9\ub3cc\uc728(CR)\uc774 \ub0ae\uc544\uc84c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub3c4\uc2dc \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c UAV\uc758 \ud56d\ubc95\uc744 \uc644\uc804\ud788 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc0c1\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uae30\uc5ec\ud558\ub294 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubb34\uc778 \ud56d\uacf5\uae30(UAV)\ub294 \ubc30\ub2ec \ubc0f \uac10\uc2dc \ubaa9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub3c4\uc2dc \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc5d0 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc774 \ubc30\uce58\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc2ec\uce35 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ucd5c\uc801 \ud56d\ubc95 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud658\uacbd\uc740 \ub09c\uae30\ub958\uc640 \uc21c\ud658 \uad6c\uc5ed\uc774 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc778 \uace0\ucda9\uc2e4\ub3c4 3\ucc28\uc6d0 \ub3c4\uc2dc \ud750\ub984 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc73c\ub85c \ud45c\ud604\ub41c\ub2e4. \uc5ec\uae30\uc11c \uc81c\uc2dc\ub41c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \ud750\ub984 \uc778\uc2dd\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud55c Proximal Policy Optimization(PPO)\uacfc Gated Transformer eXtra Large(GTrXL) \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ub0b4\ube44\uac8c\uc774\ud2b8\ud558\ub294 \ub09c\uae30\ub958 \ud750\ub984\uc7a5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub354 \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4. \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 2\ucc28 \uc608\uce21 \uc791\uc5c5\uc774 \uc5c6\ub294 PPO+GTrXL, Long Short Term Memory(LSTM) \uc140\uacfc \uacb0\ud569\ub41c PPO \ubc0f \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ub0b4\ube44\uac8c\uc774\uc158 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ub41c\ub2e4. \uc5bb\uc5b4\uc9c4 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 PPO+LSTM, PPO+GTrXL \ubc0f \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 Zermelo\uc758 \ub0b4\ube44\uac8c\uc774\uc158 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc720\uc758\ubbf8\ud55c \uc131\uacf5\ub960(SR) \uc99d\uac00 \ubc0f \ub0ae\uc740 \ucda9\ub3cc\uc728(CR)\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub3c4\uc2dc \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c UAV\uc758 \uc804\uba74\uc801\uc778 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uae38\uc744 \uc5f4\uc5b4\uc900\ub2e4."}}

Combining\nSNNs with Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), a variant of recurrent neural networks,\ngives rise to a robust framework for sequential data processing; however,\ntraditional RNNs often lose local details when handling long sequences.\nPrevious approaches, such as SpikGRU, fail to capture fine-grained local\ndependencies in event-based spatio-temporal data. In this paper, we introduce\nthe Convolutional Spiking GRU (CS-GRU) cell, which leverages convolutional\noperations to preserve local structure and dependencies while integrating the\ntemporal precision of spiking neurons with the efficient gating mechanisms of\nGRUs. This versatile architecture excels on both temporal datasets (NTIDIGITS,\nSHD) and spatio-temporal benchmarks (MNIST, DVSGesture, CIFAR10DVS). Our\nexperiments show that CS-GRU outperforms state-of-the-art GRU variants by an\naverage of 4.35%, achieving over 90% accuracy on sequential tasks and up to\n99.31% on MNIST.

However, existing approaches often lack emotional\nunderstanding, adaptive strategies, and the use of therapeutic methods across\nmultiple sessions with long-term memory, leaving them far from real clinical\npractice. To address these critical gaps, we introduce TheraMind, a strategic\nand adaptive agent for longitudinal psychological counseling. The cornerstone\nof TheraMind is a novel dual-loop architecture that decouples the complex\ncounseling process into an Intra-Session Loop for tactical dialogue management\nand a Cross-Session Loop for strategic therapeutic planning. The Intra-Session\nLoop perceives the patient's emotional state to dynamically select response\nstrategies while leveraging cross-session memory to ensure continuity.\nCrucially, the Cross-Session Loop empowers the agent with long-term\nadaptability by evaluating the efficacy of the applied therapy after each\nsession and adjusting the method for subsequent interactions. We validate our\napproach in a high-fidelity simulation environment grounded in real clinical\ncases.
