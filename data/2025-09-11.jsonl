Although smaller in scale when compared to historical\nbreaches involving billions of records, Signalgate illustrates critical\nsystemic issues often overshadowed by a focus on external cyber threats.\nEmploying a case-study approach and systematic review grounded in the NIST\nCybersecurity Framework, we analyze the incident to identify patterns of\nhuman-centric vulnerabilities and governance challenges common to\norganizational security failures. Findings emphasize three critical points. (1)\nOrganizational security depends heavily on human behavior, with internal actors\noften serving as the weakest link despite advanced technical defenses; (2)\nLeadership tone strongly influences organizational security culture and\nefficacy, and (3) widespread reliance on technical solutions without sufficient\ninvestments in human and organizational factors leads to ineffective practices\nand wasted resources. From these observations, we propose actionable\nrecommendations for enhancing organizational and national security, including\nstrong leadership engagement, comprehensive adoption of zero-trust\narchitectures, clearer accountability structures, incentivized security\nbehaviors, and rigorous oversight. Particularly during periods of\norganizational transition, such as mergers or large-scale personnel changes,\nadditional measures become particularly important. Signalgate underscores the\nneed for leaders and policymakers to reorient cybersecurity strategies toward\naddressing governance, cultural, and behavioral risks."}

We find that VISION reduces spurious learning and enables more\nrobust, generalizable detection, improving overall accuracy (from 51.8% to\n97.8%), pairwise contrast accuracy (from 4.5% to 95.8%), and worst-group\naccuracy (from 0.7% to 85.5%) on the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)-20\nvulnerability. We further demonstrate gains using proposed metrics: intra-class\nattribution variance, inter-class attribution distance, and node score\ndependency. We also release CWE-20-CFA, a benchmark of 27,556 functions (real\nand counterfactual) from the high-impact CWE-20 category.

By leveraging graph signal\nprocessing (GSP) and frequency-selective filters grounded in the Laplacian\neigenstructure of knowledge graphs, the architecture unifies the\ninterpretability of symbolic reasoning with the scalability and adaptability of\nspectral learning. Beyond the core formulation, we incorporate a comprehensive\nset of extensions, including dynamic graph and basis learning, rational and\ndiffusion filters for sharper spectral selectivity, mixture-of-spectral-experts\nfor modular specialization, proof-guided training with spectral curricula, and\nuncertainty quantification for calibrated confidence. Additional enhancements\nsuch as large language model coupling, co-spectral transfer alignment,\nadversarial robustness, efficient GPU kernels, generalized Laplacians, and\ncausal interventions further expand the versatility of the framework.\n  Empirical evaluation on state-of-the-art reasoning benchmarks such as\nProofWriter and CLUTRR demonstrates that Spectral NSR achieves superior\naccuracy, faster inference, improved robustness to adversarial perturbations,\nand higher interpretability compared to leading baselines including\ntransformers, message-passing neural networks, and neuro-symbolic logic\nprogramming systems. Spectral attribution and proof-band agreement analyses\nconfirm that model decisions align closely with symbolic proof structures,\nwhile transfer experiments validate effective domain adaptation through\nco-spectral alignment. These results establish Spectral NSR as a scalable and\nprincipled foundation for the next generation of reasoning systems, offering\ntransparency, robustness, and generalization beyond conventional approaches."}

Marlin", "Rebecca Gorman"], "title": "ACE and Diverse Generalization via Selective Disagreement", "comment": null, "summary": "Deep neural networks are notoriously sensitive to spurious correlations -\nwhere a model learns a shortcut that fails out-of-distribution. Existing work\non spurious correlations has often focused on incomplete\ncorrelations,leveraging access to labeled instances that break the correlation.\nBut in cases where the spurious correlations are complete, the correct\ngeneralization is fundamentally \\textit{underspecified}. To resolve this\nunderspecification, we propose learning a set of concepts that are consistent\nwith training data but make distinct predictions on a subset of novel unlabeled\ninputs. Using a self-training approach that encourages \\textit{confident} and\n\\textit{selective} disagreement, our method ACE matches or outperforms existing\nmethods on a suite of complete-spurious correlation benchmarks, while remaining\nrobust to incomplete spurious correlations. ACE is also more configurable than\nprior approaches, allowing for straight-forward encoding of prior knowledge and\nprincipled unsupervised model selection. In an early application to\nlanguage-model alignment, we find that ACE achieves competitive performance on\nthe measurement tampering detection benchmark \\textit{without} access to\nuntrusted measurements. While still subject to important limitations, ACE\nrepresents significant progress towards overcoming underspecification."}

Previous studies on large language\nmodels (LLMs) have highlighted their impressive generalization abilities and\neffectiveness in healthcare prediction tasks. However, most LLM-based\nhealthcare solutions are cloud-based, which raises significant privacy concerns\nand results in increased memory usage and latency. To address these challenges,\nthere is growing interest in compact models, Small Language Models (SLMs),\nwhich are lightweight and designed to run locally and efficiently on mobile and\nwearable devices. Nevertheless, how well these models perform in healthcare\nprediction remains largely unexplored. We systematically evaluated SLMs on\nhealth prediction tasks using zero-shot, few-shot, and instruction fine-tuning\napproaches, and deployed the best performing fine-tuned SLMs on mobile devices\nto evaluate their real-world efficiency and predictive performance in practical\nhealthcare scenarios. Our results show that SLMs can achieve performance\ncomparable to LLMs while offering substantial gains in efficiency and privacy.\nHowever, challenges remain, particularly in handling class imbalance and\nfew-shot scenarios. These findings highlight SLMs, though imperfect in their\ncurrent form, as a promising solution for next-generation, privacy-preserving\nhealthcare monitoring."}

Recently, AlphaEvolve \\cite{novikov2025alphaevolve}\ndemonstrated that LLM-based coding agents can autonomously improve algorithms\nand surpass human experts, with scopes limited to isolated kernels spanning\nhundreds of lines of code. Inspired by AlphaEvolve, we present SATLUTION, the\nfirst framework to extend LLM-based code evolution to the full repository\nscale, encompassing hundreds of files and tens of thousands of lines of C/C++\ncode. Targeting Boolean Satisfiability (SAT), the canonical NP-complete problem\nand a cornerstone of both theory and applications. SATLUTION orchestrates LLM\nagents to directly evolve solver repositories under strict correctness\nguarantees and distributed runtime feedback, while simultaneously self-evolving\nits own evolution policies and rules. Starting from SAT Competition 2024\ncodebases and benchmark, SATLUTION evolved solvers that decisively outperformed\nthe human-designed winners of the SAT Competition 2025, and also surpassed both\n2024 and 2025 champions on the 2024 benchmarks."}

As a\nresult, the LLM agent may undertake unproductive actions, such as exploiting\nunused software libraries or generating cyclical responses that repeat prior\ntactics. In this work, we propose a guided reasoning pipeline for penetration\ntesting LLM agents that incorporates a deterministic task tree built from the\nMITRE ATT&CK Matrix, a proven penetration testing kll chain, to constrain the\nLLM's reaoning process to explicitly defined tactics, techniques, and\nprocedures. This anchors reasoning in proven penetration testing methodologies\nand filters out ineffective actions by guiding the agent towards more\nproductive attack procedures. To evaluate our approach, we built an automated\npenetration testing LLM agent using three LLMs (Llama-3-8B, Gemini-1.5, and\nGPT-4) and applied it to navigate 10 HackTheBox cybersecurity exercises with\n103 discrete subtasks representing real-world cyberattack scenarios. Our\nproposed reasoning pipeline guided the LLM agent through 71.8\\%, 72.8\\%, and\n78.6\\% of subtasks using Llama-3-8B, Gemini-1.5, and GPT-4, respectively.\nComparatively, the state-of-the-art LLM penetration testing tool using\nself-guided reasoning completed only 13.5\\%, 16.5\\%, and 75.7\\% of subtasks and\nrequired 86.2\\%, 118.7\\%, and 205.9\\% more model queries. This suggests that\nincorporating a deterministic task tree into LLM reasoning pipelines can\nenhance the accuracy and efficiency of automated cybersecurity assessments"}
