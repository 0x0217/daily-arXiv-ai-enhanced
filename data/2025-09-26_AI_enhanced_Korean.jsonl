To Appear at ECAI 2025", "summary": "Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is a growing research area which\ngained significant traction in recent years, extending Deep RL applications to\na much wider range of problems. A particularly challenging class of problems in\nthis domain is Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HeMARL), where\nagents with different sensors, resources, or capabilities must cooperate based\non local information. The large number of real-world situations involving\nheterogeneous agents makes it an attractive research area, yet underexplored,\nas most MARL research focuses on homogeneous agents (e.g., a swarm of identical\nrobots). In MARL and single-agent RL, standardized environments such as ALE and\nSMAC have allowed to establish recognized benchmarks to measure progress.\nHowever, there is a clear lack of such standardized testbed for cooperative\nHeMARL. As a result, new research in this field often uses simple environments,\nwhere most algorithms perform near optimally, or uses weakly heterogeneous MARL\nenvironments.", "AI": {"tldr": "Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HeMARL)\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc13c\uc11c\uc640 \uc790\uc6d0\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc774 \uc9c0\uc5ed \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \ud611\ub825\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c, \ub9ce\uc740 \uc2e4world \uc0ac\ub840\uac00 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc \ud45c\uc900\ud654\ub41c \ud3c9\uac00 \uae30\uc900\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uc5ec \uc5f0\uad6c\uac00 \ubbf8\ube44\ud558\ub2e4.", "motivation": "Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HeMARL)\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uacfc \uc5f0\uad6c \ubd80\uc871\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud568.", "method": "\ud604\uc7ac MARL \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc8fc\ub85c \ub3d9\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, HeMARL\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud45c\uc900\ud654\ub41c \ud3c9\uac00 \ud658\uacbd\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub9ce\uc740 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc774 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd5c\uc801 \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0 \uac00\uae4c\uc6b4 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc774\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc57d\ud55c \ub3d9\uc9c8\uc131\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 MARL \ud658\uacbd\uc774 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "HeMARL \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud45c\uc900\ud654\ub41c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ubca0\ub4dc\uc758 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(MARL)\uc740 \ucd5c\uadfc \uba87 \ub144 \ub3d9\uc548 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uad00\uc2ec\uc744 \uc5bb\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \uc131\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \uc5f0\uad6c \ubd84\uc57c\ub85c, \uc2ec\uce35 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc744 \ud6e8\uc52c \ub354 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc601\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c \ud2b9\ud788 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc778 \ubb38\uc81c \uc9d1\ud569\uc740 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(HeMARL)\uc73c\ub85c, \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \uc13c\uc11c, \uc790\uc6d0 \ub610\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc774 \uc9c0\uc5ed \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud611\ub825\ud574\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uc9c8\uc801 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ud3ec\ud568\ub41c \ub9ce\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc0c1\ud669\uc740 \ub9e4\ub825\uc801\uc778 \uc5f0\uad6c \uc601\uc5ed\uc744 \ub9cc\ub4e4\uc5b4 \ub0b4\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc5f0\uad6c\uac00 \ubbf8\ube44\ud558\uba70, \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 MARL \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub3d9\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8(\uc608: \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \ub85c\ubd07 \uad70\uc9d1)\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

This limitation leads to inefficient task\nrouting, particularly in dynamic environments where agent capabilities\ncontinuously evolve. We introduce Knowledge Base-Aware (KBA) Orchestration, a\nnovel approach that augments static descriptions with dynamic,\nprivacy-preserving relevance signals derived from each agent's internal\nknowledge base (KB). In the proposed framework, when static descriptions are\ninsufficient for a clear routing decision, the orchestrator prompts the\nsubagents in parallel. Each agent then assesses the task's relevance against\nits private KB, returning a lightweight ACK signal without exposing the\nunderlying data. These collected signals populate a shared semantic cache,\nproviding dynamic indicators of agent suitability for future queries. By\ncombining this novel mechanism with static descriptions, our method achieves\nmore accurate and adaptive task routing preserving agent autonomy and data\nconfidentiality. Benchmarks show that our KBA Orchestration significantly\noutperforms static description-driven methods in routing precision and overall\nsystem efficiency, making it suitable for large-scale systems that require\nhigher accuracy than standard description-driven routing.", "AI": {"tldr": "KBA Orchestration\uc740 \uc815\uc801 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc124\uba85\uc744 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc9c0\uc2dd

While\nseeking answers to know more on those security concerns, users are mostly left\nwith their own discretion while going through various sources, such as online\nblogs and technical manuals, which may render higher complexity to regular\nusers trying to extract the necessary information. This requirement does not go\nalong with the common mindsets of smart home users and hence threatens the\nsecurity of smart homes furthermore. In this paper, we aim to identify and\naddress the major user-level security concerns in smart homes. Specifically, we\ndevelop a novel dataset of Q&A from public forums, capturing practical security\nchallenges faced by smart home users. We extract major security concerns in\nsmart homes from our dataset by leveraging the Latent Dirichlet Allocation\n(LDA). We fine-tune relatively \"smaller\" transformer models, such as T5 and\nFlan-T5, on this dataset to build a QA system tailored for smart home security.\nUnlike larger models like GPT and Gemini, which are powerful but often resource\nhungry and require data sharing, smaller models are more feasible for\ndeployment in resource-constrained or privacy-sensitive environments like smart\nhomes. The dataset is manually curated and supplemented with synthetic data to\nexplore its potential impact on model performance. This approach significantly\nimproves the system's ability to deliver accurate and relevant answers, helping\nusers address common security concerns with smart home IoT devices.

To solve this problem, in this paper, a new hybrid\nanalysis method is presented by using the Enhanced ANFIS. The model proposes\nseveral advances of the conventional ANFIS framework and employs a\nmulti-resolution wavelet decomposition module and a temporal attention\nmechanism. The model performs discrete wavelet transformations on historical\ntransaction data and macroeconomic indicators to generate localized economic\nshock signals. The transformed features are then fed into a deep fuzzy rule\nlibrary which is based on Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy rules with adaptive Gaussian\nmembership functions. The model proposes a temporal attention encoder that\nadaptively assigns weights to multi-scale economic behavior patterns,\nincreasing the effectiveness of relevance assessment in the fuzzy inference\nstage and enhancing the capture of long-term temporal dependencies and\nanomalies caused by fraudulent activities. The proposed method differs from\nclassical ANFIS which has fixed input-output relations since it integrates\nfuzzy rule activation with the wavelet basis selection and the temporal\ncorrelation weights via a modular training procedure. Experimental results show\nthat the RMSE was reduced by 17.8% compared with local neuro-fuzzy models and\nconventional LSTM models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc2e0\uc6a9 \uce74\ub4dc \uc0ac\uae30\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud63c\ud569 \ubd84\uc11d \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2e0\uc6a9 \uce74\ub4dc \uc0ac\uae30\uac00 \ubbf8\uad6d \uac00\uc815\uc758 \uc7ac\uc815\uc801 \uc704\uce58\uc5d0 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc704\ud611\uc73c\ub85c \uc790\ub9ac \uc7a1\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uac00\uc815\uc758 \uacbd\uc81c\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \uc608\uce21 \ubd88\uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "Enhanced ANFIS\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud63c\ud569 \ubd84\uc11d \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc5ec\uae30\uc5d0\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud574\uc0c1\ub3c4 \uc6e8\uc774\ube0c\ub81b \ubd84\ud574 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uacfc \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \uc8fc\uc758 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774 \ud3ec\ud568\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801 \uac70\ub798 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubc0f \uac70\uc2dc\uacbd\uc81c \uc9c0\ud45c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc774\uc0b0 \uc6e8\uc774\ube0c\ub81b \ubcc0\ud658\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc5ec \uc9c0\uc5ed\ud654\ub41c \uacbd\uc81c \ucda9\uaca9 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uace0\uc815\ub41c \uc785\ub825-\ucd9c\ub825 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \uace0\uc804\uc801\uc778 ANFIS\uc640\ub294 \ub2ec\ub9ac \uc6e8\uc774\ube0c\ub81b \uae30\ucd08 \uc120\ud0dd \ubc0f \uc2dc\uac04 \uc0c1\uad00 \uacc4\uc218\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \ub192\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc2e0\uc6a9 \uce74\ub4dc \uc0ac\uae30\ub294 \ubbf8\uad6d \uac00\uc815\uc758 \uc7ac\uc815\uc801 \uc704\uce58\uc5d0 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc704\ud611\uc73c\ub85c \uc790\ub9ac \uc7a1\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uac00\uc815\uc758 \uacbd\uc81c\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \uc608\uce21 \ubd88\uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 Enhanced ANFIS\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud63c\ud569 \ubd84\uc11d \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uae30\uc874 ANFIS \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uac00\uc9c0 \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud574\uc0c1\ub3c4 \uc6e8\uc774\ube0c\ub81b \ubd84\ud574 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uacfc \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \uc8fc\uc758 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801 \uac70\ub798 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \uac70\uc2dc\uacbd\uc81c \uc9c0\ud45c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc774\uc0b0 \uc6e8\uc774\ube0c\ub81b \ubcc0\ud658\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc5ec \uc9c0\uc5ed\ud654\ub41c \uacbd\uc81c \ucda9\uaca9 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcc0\ud658\ub41c \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc740 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uac00\uc6b0\uc2dc\uc548 \uba64\ubc84\uc2ed \ud568\uc218\uac00 \uc788\ub294 Takagi-Sugeno \ud37c\uc9c0 \uaddc\uce59\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \uc2ec\uce35 \ud37c\uc9c0 \uaddc\uce59 \ub77c\uc774\ube0c\ub7ec\ub9ac\uc5d0 \uc785\ub825\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \uaddc\ubaa8 \uacbd\uc81c \ud589\ub3d9 \ud328\ud134\uc5d0 \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub97c \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd80\uc5ec\ud558\ub294 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \uc8fc\uc758 \uc778\ucf54\ub354\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \ud37c\uc9c0 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uad00\ub828\uc131 \ud3c9\uac00\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \ub192\uc774\uace0 \uc0ac\uae30 \ud65c\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uc7a5\uae30\uc801 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc758\uc874\uc131 \ubc0f \uc774\uc0c1 \uac10\uc9c0\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc6e8\uc774\ube0c\ub81b \uae30\ucd08 \uc120\ud0dd \ubc0f \uc2dc\uac04 \uc0c1\uad00 \uacc4\uc218\ub97c \ubaa8\ub4c8 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc808\ucc28\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uace0\uc815\ub41c \uc785\ub825-\ucd9c\ub825 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \uace0\uc804\uc801\uc778 ANFIS\uc640\ub294 \ub2e4\ub985\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\uc5d0 \ub530\ub974\uba74 RMSE\ub294 \uc9c0\uc5ed \uc2e0\uacbd-\ud37c\uc9c0 \ubaa8\ub378 \ubc0f \uae30\uc874 LSTM \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 17.8% \uac10\uc18c\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

While models excel at isolated tasks, the\ncomputational limits that govern their reasoning under cognitive load remain\npoorly understood. In this work, we introduce a formal theory of computational\ncognitive load, positing that extraneous, task-irrelevant information (Context\nSaturation) and interference from task-switching (Attentional Residue) are key\nmechanisms that degrade performance. We designed the Interleaved Cognitive\nEvaluation (ICE), a deconfounded benchmark to systematically manipulate these\nload factors on challenging multi-hop reasoning tasks. A comprehensive study (N\n= 10 replications per item across 200 questions) revealed significant\nperformance variations across five instruction-tuned models. Smaller\nopen-source architectures (Llama-3-8B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2)\nexhibited baseline brittleness, achieving 0% accuracy (SEM = 0.0) across all\nconditions, including clean controls, on this high-intrinsic-load task. In\ncontrast, Gemini-2.0-Flash-001 showed partial resilience, achieving 85%\naccuracy in control conditions, with a statistically significant degradation\nunder context saturation ($\\beta = -0.003$ per % load, $p < 0.001$). These\nfindings provide preliminary evidence that cognitive load is a key contributor\nto reasoning failures, supporting theories of hallucination-as-guessing under\nuncertainty. We conclude that dynamic, cognitive-aware stress testing, as\nexemplified by the ICE benchmark, is essential for evaluating the true\nresilience and safety of advanced AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr":

While Large Language\nModels (LLMs) have the potential to automate and scale Security Operations\nCenter (SOC) operations, existing evaluations do not fully assess the scenarios\nmost relevant to real-world defenders. This lack of informed evaluation impacts\nboth AI developers and those applying LLMs to SOC automation. Without clear\ninsight into LLM performance in real-world security scenarios, developers lack\na north star for development, and users cannot reliably select the most\neffective models. Meanwhile, malicious actors are using AI to scale cyber\nattacks, highlighting the need for open source benchmarks to drive adoption and\ncommunity-driven improvement among defenders and model developers. To address\nthis, we introduce CyberSOCEval, a new suite of open source benchmarks within\nCyberSecEval 4. CyberSOCEval includes benchmarks tailored to evaluate LLMs in\ntwo tasks: Malware Analysis and Threat Intelligence Reasoning--core defensive\ndomains with inadequate coverage in current benchmarks. Our evaluations show\nthat larger, more modern LLMs tend to perform better, confirming the training\nscaling laws paradigm. We also find that reasoning models leveraging test time\nscaling do not achieve the same boost as in coding and math, suggesting these\nmodels have not been trained to reason about cybersecurity analysis, and\npointing to a key opportunity for improvement.

Attack trees are\nwidely used to systematically represent potential attack vectors, but\ngenerating comprehensive test cases from these trees remains a labor-intensive,\nerror-prone task that has seen limited automation in the context of testing\nvehicular systems. This paper introduces STAF (Security Test Automation\nFramework), a novel approach to automating security test case generation.\nLeveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and a four-step self-corrective\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, STAF automates the generation\nof executable security test cases from attack trees, providing an end-to-end\nsolution that encompasses the entire attack surface. We particularly show the\nelements and processes needed to provide an LLM to actually produce sensible\nand executable automotive security test suites, along with the integration with\nan automated testing framework. We further compare our tailored approach with\ngeneral purpose (vanilla) LLMs and the performance of different LLMs (namely\nGPT-4.1 and DeepSeek) using our approach. We also demonstrate the method of our\noperation step-by-step in a concrete case study. Our results show significant\nimprovements in efficiency, accuracy, scalability, and easy integration in any\nworkflow, marking a substantial advancement in automating automotive security\ntesting methodologies. Using TARAs as an input for verfication tests, we create\nsynergies by connecting two vital elements of a secure automotive development\nprocess.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740

Inherent to these probabilistic models is some form of\nuncertainty quantification. However, most models do not capture the full extent\nof uncertainty, which arises not only from the data itself but also from model\nand distributional choices. In this study, we examine uncertainty\nquantification in state-of-the-art statistical and deep learning probabilistic\nforecasting models for electricity price forecasting in the German market. In\nparticular, we consider deep distributional neural networks (DDNNs) and augment\nthem with an ensemble approach, Monte Carlo (MC) dropout, and conformal\nprediction to account for model uncertainty. Additionally, we consider the\nLASSO-estimated autoregressive (LEAR) approach combined with quantile\nregression averaging (QRA), generalized autoregressive conditional\nheteroskedasticity (GARCH), and conformal prediction. Across a range of\nperformance metrics, we find that the LEAR-based models perform well in terms\nof probabilistic forecasting, irrespective of the uncertainty quantification\nmethod. Furthermore, we find that DDNNs benefit from incorporating both data\nand model uncertainty, improving both point and probabilistic forecasting.\nUncertainty itself appears to be best captured by the models using conformal\nprediction. Overall, our extensive study shows that all models under\nconsideration perform competitively. However, their relative performance\ndepends on the choice of metrics for point and probabilistic forecasting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub3c5\uc77c \uc2dc\uc7a5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc804\uae30 \uac00\uaca9 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ucd5c\uc2e0 \ud1b5\uacc4 \ubc0f \ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd \ud655\ub960 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc815\ud655\ud55c \ud655\ub960 \uc608\uce21\uc740 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \ub9ac\uc2a4\ud06c \uad00\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud1b5\uacc4 \ubc0f \uba38\uc2e0\ub7ec\ub2dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc874\uc7ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub525 \ubc30\ud3ec \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(DDNN)\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uace0, \uc559\uc0c1\ube14 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95, \ubaac\ud14c\uce74\ub97c\ub85c \ub4dc\ub86d\uc544\uc6c3, \uaddc\ubc94\uc801 \uc608\uce21\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "LEAR \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud655\ub960 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0\uc11c \uc88b\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, DDNN\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \ubaa8\ub378 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud560 \uacbd\uc6b0 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub41c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubaa8\ub4e0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc0c1\ub300\uc801 \uc131\ub2a5\uc740 \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8 \ubc0f \ud655\ub960 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc9c0\ud45c \uc120\ud0dd\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ub2ec\ub77c\uc9c4\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc815\ud655\ud55c \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uc608\uce21\uc740 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \ub9ac\uc2a4\ud06c \uad00\ub9ac\uc5d0 \uae30\ubcf8\uc774 \ub418\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \ubc0f \uba38\uc2e0\ub7ec\ub2dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubc94\uc704\uac00 \uc874\uc7ac\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud655\ub960\uc801 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uace0\uc720\ud55c \ud2b9\uc131\uc740 \uc5b4\ub5a4 \ud615\ud0dc\uc758 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\uac00 \ud3ec\ud568\ub41c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc790\uccb4\ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \ubaa8\ub378 \ubc0f \ubd84\ud3ec \uc120\ud0dd\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uc644\uc804\ud788 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub3c5\uc77c \uc2dc\uc7a5\uc758 \uc804\uae30 \uac00\uaca9 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud558\uc5ec \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ud1b5\uacc4 \ubc0f \ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uc608\uce21 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4. \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub525 \ubc30\ud3ec \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(DDNN)\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \uc559\uc0c1\ube14 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95, \ubaac\ud14c\uce74\ub97c\ub85c \ub4dc\ub86d\uc544\uc6c3 \ubc0f \uaddc\ubc94\uc801 \uc608\uce21\uacfc \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \ubc18\uc601\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, LASSO \ucd94\uc815 \uc790\uae30\ud68c\uadc0(LEAR) \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574\uc11c\ub3c4 \ubd84\ubcc4\ud68c\uadc0 \ud3c9\uade0(QRA), \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub41c \uc790\uae30\ud68c\uadc0 \uc870\uac74\ubd80 \uc774\ubd84\uc0b0(GARCH) \ubc0f \uaddc\ubc94\uc801 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uac80\ud1a0\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5 \uc9c0\ud45c\uc5d0\uc11c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 LEAR \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uc774 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \uad00\uacc4\uc5c6\uc774 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0\uc11c \uc88b\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, DDNN\uc774 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \ubaa8\ub378 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8 \uc608\uce21\uacfc \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uc608\uce21 \ubaa8\ub450 \uac1c\uc120\ub41c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\ub2e4. \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc790\uccb4\ub294 \uaddc\ubc94\uc801 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uac00\uc7a5 \uc798 \ud3ec\ucc29\ub418\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4. \uc804\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uac00 \uace0\ub824\ud558\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uadf8\ub4e4\uc758 \uc0c1\ub300\uc801\uc778 \uc131\ub2a5\uc740 \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8 \ubc0f \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad \uc120\ud0dd\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ub2e4\ub974\ub2e4."}}

In\nthis work, we propose UserRL, a unified framework for training and evaluating\nuser-centric abilities through standardized gym environments paired with\nsimulated users. We systematically vary turn-level reward assignment and\ntrajectory-level score calculation to analyze how different formulations affect\nlearning under the GRPO algorithm. Our experiments across Qwen3 models reveal\nthree key findings: (i) SFT cold start is critical for unlocking initial\ninteraction ability and enabling sustained RL improvements; (ii) deliberate\ntrajectory scoring yields more efficient and effective multi-turn interactions;\nand (iii) while stronger simulated users (e.g., GPT-4o) facilitates training,\nopen-source simulators (e.g., Qwen3-32B) remain a cost-effective and\ntransferable option. Together, these results highlight that careful design of\nreward shaping and user simulation choice is as crucial as model scale, and\nestablish UserRL as a practical pathway for developing robust user-centric\nagentic models.

Agents can become trapped in unforeseen loops, generate inaccurate\noutputs, or encounter unrecoverable failures, leading to user frustration and a\nbreakdown of trust. This report proposes a novel architectural pattern to\naddress these issues: the integration of a secondary, \"metacognitive\" layer\nthat actively monitors the primary LCNC agent. Inspired by human introspection,\nthis layer is designed to predict impending task failures based on a defined\nset of triggers, such as excessive latency or repetitive actions. Upon\npredicting a failure, the metacognitive agent proactively initiates a human\nhandoff, providing the user with a clear summary of the agent's \"thought\nprocess\" and a detailed explanation of why it could not proceed. An empirical\nanalysis of a prototype system demonstrates that this approach significantly\nincreases the overall task success rate. However, this performance gain comes\nwith a notable increase in computational overhead. The findings reframe human\nhandoffs not as an admission of defeat but as a core design feature that\nenhances system resilience, improves user experience, and builds trust by\nproviding transparency into the agent's internal state.

Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) and World Models\n(WMs) have drawn significant attention for embodied AI. On the one hand, LLMs\nempower embodied AI via semantic reasoning and task decomposition, bringing\nhigh-level natural language instructions and low-level natural language actions\ninto embodied cognition. On the other hand, WMs empower embodied AI by building\ninternal representations and future predictions of the external world,\nfacilitating physical law-compliant embodied interactions. As such, this paper\ncomprehensively explores the literature in embodied AI from basics to advances,\ncovering both LLM driven and WM driven works. In particular, we first present\nthe history, key technologies, key components, and hardware systems of embodied\nAI, as well as discuss its development via looking from unimodal to multimodal\nangle. We then scrutinize the two burgeoning fields of embodied AI, i.e.,\nembodied AI with LLMs/multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) and embodied AI with WMs,\nmeticulously delineating their indispensable roles in end-to-end embodied\ncognition and physical laws-driven embodied interactions.

While foundation models possess strong semantic\npriors, their capabilities as zero-shot exploration agents in classic RL\nbenchmarks are not well understood. We benchmark LLMs and VLMs on multi-armed\nbandits, Gridworlds, and sparse-reward Atari to test zero-shot exploration. Our\ninvestigation reveals a key limitation: while VLMs can infer high-level\nobjectives from visual input, they consistently fail at precise low-level\ncontrol: the \"knowing-doing gap\". To analyze a potential bridge for this gap,\nwe investigate a simple on-policy hybrid framework in a controlled, best-case\nscenario.

Current\nprompt engineering and multi-agent approaches typically optimize isolated\ninferences, neglecting the accumulation of reusable clinical experience. To\naddress this, this study proposes a novel Multi-Agent Clinical Diagnosis (MACD)\nframework, which allows LLMs to self-learn clinical knowledge via a multi-agent\npipeline that summarizes, refines, and applies diagnostic insights. It mirrors\nhow physicians develop expertise through experience, enabling more focused and\naccurate diagnosis on key disease-specific cues. We further extend it to a\nMACD-human collaborative workflow, where multiple LLM-based diagnostician\nagents engage in iterative consultations, supported by an evaluator agent and\nhuman oversight for cases where agreement is not reached. Evaluated on 4,390\nreal-world patient cases across seven diseases using diverse open-source LLMs\n(Llama-3.1 8B/70B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama 70B), MACD significantly improves\nprimary diagnostic accuracy, outperforming established clinical guidelines with\ngains up to 22.3% (MACD). On the subset of the data, it achieves performance on\npar with or exceeding that of human physicians (up to 16% improvement over\nphysicians-only diagnosis). Additionally, on the MACD-human workflow, it\nachieves an 18.6% improvement compared to physicians-only diagnosis. Moreover,\nself-learned knowledge exhibits strong cross-model stability, transferability,\nand model-specific personalization, while the system can generate traceable\nrationales, enhancing explainability. Consequently, this work presents a\nscalable self-learning paradigm for LLM-assisted diagnosis, bridging the gap\nbetween the intrinsic knowledge of LLMs and real-world clinical practice.", "AI":

Weight-only PTQ is crucial for reducing the memory footprint\nand latency of LLM inference, especially in memory-bound, small-batch inference\nscenarios, such as personalized inference on edge devices. Despite its\nimportance, irregular weight distributions with heavy-tailed outliers in LLMs\ncomplicate quantization, recently motivating rotation-based methods that\ntransform weights into near-Gaussian distributions, which are more regular with\nfewer outliers, thereby reducing quantization error. In this work, we first\nderive the information-theoretically optimal bit allocation for Gaussianized\nweights under given bit budgets, revealing that fine-grained fractional-bit\nquantizers approaching the Gaussian distortion-rate bound are essential to\nachieve near-optimal quantization performance. To bridge this theoretical\ninsight and practical implementation, we introduce Q-Palette, a versatile\ncollection of fractional-bit quantizers that range from trellis-coded\nquantizers offering near-optimal distortion to simpler vector and scalar\nquantizers optimized for faster inference, all efficiently implemented with\noptimized CUDA kernels across various bitwidths. Furthermore, leveraging\nQ-Palette as a foundational component, we propose a novel mixed-scheme\nquantization framework, jointly optimizing quantizer choices and layer fusion\ndecisions given resource constraints.

In dynamic\nenvironments, persistent pheromone trails create positive feedback loops that\nhinder adaptation by locking swarms into obsolete choices. Through\ncomputational experiments in multi-armed bandit scenarios, we reveal that\nintroducing a minority of exploratory agents insensitive to pheromones restores\ncollective plasticity, enabling rapid task switching. This behavioural\nheterogeneity balances exploration-exploitation trade-offs, implementing\nswarm-level extinction of outdated strategies. Our results demonstrate that\nstigmergic systems inherently encode distributed RL processes, where\nenvironmental signals act as external memory for collective credit assignment.\nBy bridging synthetic biology with swarm robotics, this work advances\nprogrammable living systems capable of resilient decision-making in volatile\nenvironments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294

Many public estimates are inconsistent and overstate\nenergy use, because they extrapolate from limited benchmarks and fail to\nreflect efficiency gains achievable at scale. In this perspective, we introduce\na bottom-up methodology to estimate the per-query energy of large-scale LLM\nsystems based on token throughput. For models running on an H100 node under\nrealistic workloads, GPU utilization and PUE constraints, we estimate a median\nenergy per query of 0.34 Wh (IQR: 0.18-0.67) for frontier-scale models (>200\nbillion parameters). These results are consistent with measurements using\nproduction-scale configurations and show that non-production estimates and\nassumptions can overstate energy use by 4-20x. Extending to test-time scaling\nscenarios with 15x more tokens per typical query, the median energy rises 13x\nto 4.32 Wh, indicating that targeting efficiency in this regime will deliver\nthe largest fleet-wide savings. We quantify achievable efficiency gains at the\nmodel, serving platform, and hardware levels, finding individual median\nreductions of 1.5-3.5x in energy per query, while combined advances can\nplausibly deliver 8-20x reductions. To illustrate the system-level impact, we\nestimate the baseline daily energy use of a deployment serving 1 billion\nqueries to be 0.8 GWh/day. If 10% are long queries, demand could grow to 1.8\nGWh/day. With targeted efficiency interventions, it falls to 0.9 GWh/day,\nsimilar to the energy footprint of web search at that scale. This echoes how\ndata centers historically tempered energy growth through efficiency gains\nduring the internet and cloud build-up.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI \ucd94\ub860\uc774 \uc218\uc2ed\uc5b5 \uac1c

Built on top of MQTT,s publish-subscribe\nsemantics for scalable message passing, FoA achieves sub-linear complexity\nthrough hierarchical capability matching and efficient index maintenance.\nEvaluation on HealthBench shows 13x improvements over single-model baselines,\nwith clustering-enhanced laboration particularly effective for complex\nreasoning tasks requiring multiple perspectives.

These factors, combined with sparse\ndatasets and short historical windows, limit the effectiveness of conventional\ntime-series methods. While deep learning and Transformer-based models have\nshown promise in other domains, their performance deteriorates under partial\nobservability and limited historical data. To address these challenges, we\npropose a hybrid forecasting framework that integrates dynamic lagged feature\nengineering and adaptive rolling-window representations with classical\nstatistical models and ensemble learners. Our approach explicitly incorporates\ninvoice-level behavioral modeling, structured lag of support data, and custom\nstability-aware loss functions, enabling robust forecasts in sparse and\nirregular financial settings. Empirical results demonstrate an approximate 5%\nreduction in MAPE compared to baseline models, translating into substantial\nfinancial savings. Furthermore, the framework enhances forecast stability over\nquarterly horizons and strengthens feature target correlation by capturing both\nshort- and long-term patterns, leveraging user profile attributes, and\nsimulating upcoming invoice behaviors. These findings underscore the value of\ncombining structured lagging, invoice-level closure modeling, and behavioral\ninsights to advance predictive accuracy in sparse financial

Oligopeptides have emerged as promising candidates\nin antimicrobial research due to their structural simplicity, high\nbioavailability, and low susceptibility to resistance. Despite their potential,\ncomputational models specifically designed to predict associations between\noligopeptides and infectious diseases remain scarce. This study introduces a\nprompt-guided graph-based contrastive learning framework (PGCLODA) to uncover\npotential associations. A tripartite graph is constructed with oligopeptides,\nmicrobes, and diseases as nodes, incorporating both structural and semantic\ninformation. To preserve critical regions during contrastive learning, a\nprompt-guided graph augmentation strategy is employed to generate meaningful\npaired views. A dual encoder architecture, integrating Graph Convolutional\nNetwork (GCN) and Transformer, is used to jointly capture local and global\nfeatures. The fused embeddings are subsequently input into a multilayer\nperceptron (MLP) classifier for final prediction. Experimental results on a\nbenchmark dataset indicate that PGCLODA consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art models in AUROC, AUPRC, and accuracy. Ablation and\nhyperparameter studies confirm the contribution of each module. Case studies\nfurther validate the generalization ability of PGCLODA and its potential to\nuncover novel, biologically relevant associations. These findings offer\nvaluable insights for mechanism-driven discovery and oligopeptide-based drug\ndevelopment.
