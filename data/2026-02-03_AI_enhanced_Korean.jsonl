However, LLMs are susceptible to manipulation by fraudulent information, which can lead to harmful outcomes. Although advanced defense methods have been developed to address this issue, they often exhibit limitations in effectiveness, interpretability, and generalizability, particularly when applied to LLM-based applications. To address these challenges, we introduce FraudShield, a novel framework designed to protect LLMs from fraudulent content by leveraging a comprehensive analysis of fraud tactics. Specifically, FraudShield constructs and refines a fraud tactic-keyword knowledge graph to capture high-confidence associations between suspicious text and fraud techniques. The structured knowledge graph augments the original input by highlighting keywords and providing supporting evidence, guiding the LLM toward more secure responses. Extensive experiments show that FraudShield consistently outperforms state-of-the-art defenses across four mainstream LLMs and five representative fraud types, while also offering interpretable clues for the model's generations.", "AI": {"tldr": "FraudShield\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uc5ec \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uae30\uc801 \ub0b4\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ubcf4\ud638\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc0ac\uae30 \uc815\ubcf4\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc870\uc791\ub420 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \ud06c\uace0, \uc774\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ud574\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacb0\uacfc\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "FraudShield\ub294 \uc0ac\uae30 \uc804\uc220\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc0ac\uae30 \uc804\uc220-\ud0a4\uc6cc\ub4dc \uc9c0\uc2dd \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uc218\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "FraudShield\ub294 4\uac1c\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc 5\uac00\uc9c0 \ub300\ud45c\uc801\uc778 \uc0ac\uae30 \uc720\ud615\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ubc29\uc5b4 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "FraudShield\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc0dd\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub2e8\uc11c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ubcf4\uc548\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc740 \uacc4\uc57d \uac80\ud1a0 \ubc0f \ucc44\uc6a9 \uacfc\uc815\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uc791\uc5c5 \ud750\ub984\uc5d0 \ub110\ub9ac \ud1b5\ud569\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 LLM\uc740 \uc0ac\uae30 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc870\uc791\ub420 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \ub192\uc544 \ud574\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uace0\uae09 \ubc29\uc5b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uac1c\ubc1c\ub418\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub4e4\uc740 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud560 \ub54c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131, \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \ubc0f \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 FraudShield\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc0ac\uae30 \uc804\uc220\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec LLM\uc744 \uc0ac\uae30 \ub0b4\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc124\uacc4\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c FraudShield\ub294 \uc758\uc2ec\uc2a4\ub7ec\uc6b4 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc640 \uc0ac\uae30 \uae30\uc220 \uc0ac\uc774\uc758 \ub192\uc740 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub3c4 \uc5f0\uad00\uc131\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0ac\uae30 \uc804\uc220-\ud0a4\uc6cc\ub4dc \uc9c0\uc2dd \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uc218\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc9c0\uc2dd \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub294 \ud0a4\uc6cc\ub4dc\ub97c \uac15\uc870\ud558\uace0 \uc9c0\uc6d0 \uc99d\uac70\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc5ec LLM\uc774 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \uc751\ub2f5\uc73c\ub85c \uc548\ub0b4\ub418\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\uc5ec \uc6d0\ubcf8 \uc785\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uac15\ud55c\ub2e4. \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc FraudShield\ub294 4\uac1c\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 LLM\uacfc 5\uac00\uc9c0 \ub300\ud45c\uc801\uc778 \uc0ac\uae30 \uc720\ud615\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ubc29\uc5b4 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub354 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc0dd\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub2e8\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

The Agent Payments Protocol (AP2) aims to secure agent-led purchases through cryptographically verifiable mandates, but its practical robustness remains underexplored. In this work, we perform an AI red-teaming evaluation of AP2 and identify vulnerabilities arising from indirect and direct prompt injection. We introduce two attack techniques, the Branded Whisper Attack and the Vault Whisper Attack which manipulate product ranking and extract sensitive user data. Using a functional AP2 based shopping agent built with Gemini-2.5-Flash and the Google ADK framework, we experimentally validate that simple adversarial prompts can reliably subvert agent behavior.

Existing detection tools are hampered by low-coverage UI interaction, costly instrumentation, and a lack of scalable root-cause analysis. We present Okara, a framework that leverages foundation models to automate the detection and deep attribution of TLS MitM Vulnerabilities (TMVs). Okara's detection component, TMV-Hunter, employs foundation model-driven GUI agents to achieve high-coverage app interaction, enabling efficient vulnerability discovery at scale. Deploying TMV-Hunter on 37,349 apps from Google Play and a third-party store revealed 8,374 (22.42%) vulnerable apps. Our measurement shows these vulnerabilities are widespread across all popularity levels, affect critical functionalities like authentication and code delivery, and are highly persistent with a median vulnerable lifespan of over 1,300 days. Okara's attribution component, TMV-ORCA, combines dynamic instrumentation with a novel LLM-based classifier to locate and categorize vulnerable code according to a comprehensive new taxonomy. This analysis attributes 41% of vulnerabilities to third-party libraries and identifies recurring insecure patterns, such as empty trust managers and flawed hostname verification.

Traditional RGB surveillance raises significant concerns regarding visual recording and storage, while existing privacy-preserving methods-ranging from physical desensitization to traditional cryptographic or obfuscation techniques-often compromise semantic understanding capabilities or fail to guarantee mathematical irreversibility against reconstruction attacks. To address these challenges, this study presents a novel privacy-preserving perception technology based on the AI Flow theoretical framework and an edge-cloud collaborative architecture. The proposed methodology integrates source desensitization with irreversible feature mapping. Leveraging Information Bottleneck theory, the edge device performs millisecond-level processing to transform raw imagery into abstract feature vectors via non-linear mapping and stochastic noise injection. This process constructs a unidirectional information flow that strips identity-sensitive attributes, rendering the reconstruction of original images impossible. Subsequently, the cloud platform utilizes multimodal family models to perform joint inference solely on these abstract vectors to detect abnormal behaviors. This approach fundamentally severs the path to privacy leakage at the architectural level, achieving a breakthrough from video surveillance to de-identified behavior perception and offering a robust solution for risk management in high-sensitivity public spaces.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uac10\uc9c0 \uae30\uc220\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uace0\uac10\ub3c4\uac00 \uc694\uad6c\ub418\ub294 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638\uc640 \ubcf4\uc548\uc758 \ud328\ub7ec\ub3c5\uc2a4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud568.", "method": "AI Flow \uc774\ub860 \ud2c0\uacfc \uc5e3\uc9c0-\ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc \ud611\uc5c5 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \ucc98\ub9ac \ubc0f \ube44\uac00\uc5ed\uc801 \ud2b9\uc9d5 \ub9f5\ud551\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc720\ucd9c \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \ucc28\ub2e8\ud568.", "conclusion": "\ube44\ub514\uc624 \uac10\uc2dc\uc5d0\uc11c \ube44\uc2dd\ubcc4 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc778\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\uc544\uac08 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud68d\uae30\uc801\uc778 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud568.", "translated_summary": "\uc9c0\ub2a5\ud615 \uc13c\uc2f1\uc774 \ud654\uc7a5\uc2e4 \ubc0f \ud0c8\uc758\uc2e4\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uace0\uc0ac\uc0dd\ud65c \uacf5\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ub428\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \uc774 \ubd84\uc57c\ub294 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638\uc640 \ubcf4\uc548\uc758 \ubaa8\uc21c\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 RGB \uac10\uc2dc \uae30\uc220\uc740 \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \uae30\ub85d \ubc0f \uc800\uc7a5\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ud558\uc5ec \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc6b0\ub824\ub97c \ubd88\ub7ec\uc77c\uc73c\ud0a4\uba70, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \ube44\uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uc5ec \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc554\ud638\ud654 \uae30\uc220\uc774\ub098 \ub09c\ub3c5\ud654 \uae30\uc220\uae4c\uc9c0 \ud3ec\uad04\ud558\ub098 \uc885\uc885 \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc801 \uc774\ud574 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc800\ud558\uc2dc\ucf1c \ubcf5\uc6d0 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc218\ud559\uc801 \ube44\uac00\uc5ed\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 AI Flow \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ud2c0\uacfc \uc5e3\uc9c0-\ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc \ud611\uc5c5 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \uac10\uc9c0 \uae30\uc220\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc740 \uc18c\uc2a4 \ube44\uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\uc640 \ube44\uac00\uc5ed\uc801 \ud2b9\uc9d5 \ub9f5\ud551\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \uc774\ub860\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc5e3\uc9c0 \uc7a5\uce58\ub294 \ubc00\ub9ac\ucd08 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ucc98\ub9ac\ub85c \uc6d0\uc2dc \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub97c \ube44\uc120\ud615 \ub9f5\ud551\uacfc \ud655\ub960\uc801 \ub178\uc774\uc988 \uc8fc\uc785\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ucd94\uc0c1\uc801 \ud2b9\uc9d5 \ubca1\ud130\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uacfc\uc815\uc740 \uc2e0\uc6d0 \ubbfc\uac10 \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uac70\ud558\uc5ec \uc6d0\ubcf8 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\uc744 \ubd88\uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \ub2e8\ubc29\ud5a5 \uc815\ubcf4 \ud750\ub984\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ud6c4 \ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc740 \uc774 \ucd94\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \ubca1\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574\uc11c\ub9cc \uacb0\ud569 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc5ec \ube44\uc815\uc0c1 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uac10\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uac00\uc871 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \uc218\uc900\uc5d0\uc11c \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc720\ucd9c \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucc28\ub2e8\ud558\uc5ec \ube44\ub514\uc624 \uac10\uc2dc\uc5d0\uc11c \ube44\uc2dd\ubcc4 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc778\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \ud601\uc2e0\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uace0\uac10\ub3c4 \uacf5\uacf5 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ub9ac\uc2a4\ud06c \uad00\ub9ac\uc5d0 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

As these marketplaces expand, many candidates become functionally overlapping, making selection not just a retrieval problem: beyond filtering relevant agents, an orchestrator must choose options that are reliable, compatible with the current execution context, and able to cooperate with other selected agents. Existing recommender systems -- largely built for item-level ranking from flat user-item logs -- do not directly address the structured, sequential, and interaction-dependent nature of agent orchestration. We address this gap by \\textbf{formulating agent recommendation in MAS as a constrained decision problem} and introducing a generic \\textbf{constrained recommendation framework} that first uses retrieval to build a compact candidate set conditioned on the current subtask and context, and then performs \\textbf{utility optimization} within this feasible set using a learned scorer that accounts for relevance, reliability, and interaction effects. We ground both the formulation and learning signals in \\textbf{historical calling trees}, which capture the execution structure of MAS (parent-child calls, branching dependencies, and local cooperation patterns) beyond what flat logs provide. The framework supports two complementary settings: \\textbf{agent-level recommendation} (select the next agent/tool) and \\textbf{system-level recommendation} (select a small, connected agent team/subgraph for coordinated execution).

We introduce JAF: Judge Agent Forest, a framework in which the judge agent conducts joint inference across a cohort of query--response pairs generated by a primary agent, rather than evaluating each in isolation. This paradigm elevates the judge from a local evaluator to a holistic learner: by simultaneously assessing related responses, the judge discerns cross-instance patterns and inconsistencies, whose aggregate feedback enables the primary agent to improve by viewing its own outputs through the judge's collective perspective.\n  Conceptually, JAF bridges belief propagation and ensemble-learning principles: overlapping in-context neighborhoods induce a knowledge-graph structure that facilitates propagation of critique, and repeated, randomized evaluations yield a robust ensemble of context-sensitive judgments. JAF can be instantiated entirely via ICL, with the judge prompted for each query using its associated primary-agent response plus a small, possibly noisy set of peer exemplars. While kNN in embedding space is a natural starting point for exemplars, this approach overlooks categorical structure, domain metadata, or nuanced distinctions accessible to modern LLMs.\n  To overcome these limitations, we develop a flexible locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) algorithm that learns informative binary codes by integrating semantic embeddings, LLM-driven hash predicates, supervision from categorical labels, and relevant side information. These hash codes support efficient, interpretable, and relation-aware selection of diverse exemplars, and further optimize exploration of CoT reasoning paths. We validate JAF with an empirical study on the demanding task of cloud misconfigs triage in large-scale cloud environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "JAF\ub294 \ub3d9\uc2dc \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc8fc \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc804\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc0f \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ucffc\ub9ac-\uc751\ub2f5 \uc30d\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc790\ub3d9 \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc0f \uc790\uae30 \uac1c\uc120\ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131.", "method": "Judge Agent Forest (JAF) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574, \uc8fc \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc751\ub2f5\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uc5ec \ub3d9\uc2dc \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc2e4\uc2dc\ud558\uace0, \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc801 \ud3c9\uac00\uc790\uac00 \uc544\ub2cc \uc804\uccb4\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5\uc790\ub85c\uc11c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "JAF\ub294 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uba70 \uad00\uacc4 \uc778\uc2dd\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc608\uc2dc \uc120\ud0dd\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \ud574\uc2dc \ucf54\ub4dc\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "JAF\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc \uad6c\uc131 \uc624\ub958 \ubd84\ub958 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uac80\uc99d\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud310\ub2e8 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uc694\uc18c\ub85c, \uc790\ub3d9 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0 \ucd94\ub860 \uacfc\uc815\uc758 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \uc790\uae30 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 JAF: Judge Agent Forest\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \uc5ec\uae30\uc11c \ud310\ub2e8 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc8fc \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \ucffc\ub9ac-\uc751\ub2f5 \uc30d \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc5d0\uc11c \uacf5\ub3d9 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uba70 \uac01 \ucffc\ub9ac\ub97c \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc544\ub2d9\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc740 \ud310\ub2e8\uc790\uac00 \uc9c0\uc5ed \ud3c9\uac00\uc790\uc5d0\uc11c \uc804\uccb4\ub860\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5\uc790\ub85c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uad00\ub828\ub41c \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ud3c9\uac00\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368, \ud310\ub2e8\uc790\ub294 \uad50\ucc28 \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4 \ud328\ud134\uacfc \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc9d1\ud569\uc801\uc778 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc8fc \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \ud310\ub2e8\uc790\uc758 \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc801 \uc2dc\uac01\uc73c\ub85c \ubc14\ub77c\ubcf4\uba74\uc11c \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac1c\ub150\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, JAF\ub294 \uc2e0\ub150 \uc804\ud30c\uc640 \uc559\uc0c1\ube14 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc6d0\ub9ac\ub97c \uc5f0\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uacb9\uce58\ub294 \ub9e5\ub77d \ub0b4 \uc774\uc6c3\uc740 \ube44\ud310\uc758 \uc804\ud30c\ub97c \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\ub294 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\uba70, \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ubb34\uc791\uc704\uc801\uc778 \ud3c9\uac00\ub294 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \ud310\ub2e8\uc758 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc559\uc0c1\ube14\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

To address this issue, we propose a systematic conformal prediction approach tailored to conditional generative models, leveraging density estimation on model-generated samples. We introduce a novel method called CP4Gen, which utilizes clustering-based density estimation to construct prediction sets that are less sensitive to outliers, more interpretable, and of lower structural complexity than existing methods. Extensive experiments on synthetic datasets and real-world applications, including climate emulation tasks, demonstrate that CP4Gen consistently achieves superior performance in terms of prediction set volume and structural simplicity. Our approach offers practitioners a powerful tool for uncertainty estimation associated with conditional generative models, particularly in scenarios demanding rigorous and interpretable prediction sets.", "AI": {"tldr": "CP4Gen\uc740 \uc870\uac74\ubd80 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ucd94\uc815 \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c, \uc608\uce21 \uc9d1\ud569\uc758 \ubd80\ud53c\uc640 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ub2e8\uc21c\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc870\uac74\ubd80 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uac1c\ubcc4 \ucd9c\ub825\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub97c \ub192\uc774\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c \uc0d8\ud50c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubc00\ub3c4 \ucd94\uc815\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \uc900\uac70 \uc608\uce21 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "CP4Gen\uc740 \uc608\uce21 \uc9d1\ud569\uc758 \ubd80\ud53c\uc640 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ub2e8\uc21c\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "CP4Gen\uc740 \uc870\uac74\ubd80 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ub41c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ucd94\uc815\uc5d0 \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c\uac00 \ub41c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc870\uac74\ubd80 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc785\ub825 \ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud558\uace0 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0\uc801\uc778 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \uc0d8\ud50c \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \uace0\uc704\ud5d8 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0\uc11c \uac1c\ubcc4 \ucd9c\ub825\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub97c \uc800\ud574\ud558\ub294 \ubcf4\uc815\ub41c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc758 \ubd80\uc7ac\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubc00\ub3c4 \ucd94\uc815\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc870\uac74\ubd80 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucda4\ud654\ub41c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \uc900\uac70 \uc608\uce21 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 CP4Gen\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130\ub9c1 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc00\ub3c4 \ucd94\uc815\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\uc0c1\uce58\uc5d0 \ub35c \ubbfc\uac10\ud558\uace0, \ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uba70, \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub0ae\uc740 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \uc608\uce21 \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \uad6c\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc640 \uae30\ud6c4 \uc5d0\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uc2e4\uc81c \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, CP4Gen\uc740 \uc608\uce21 \uc9d1\ud569\uc758 \ubd80\ud53c\uc640 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ub2e8\uc21c\uc131 \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \ud2b9\ud788 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud558\uace0 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc608\uce21 \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uc870\uac74\ubd80 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ub41c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ucd94\uc815\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

By utilizing semantic embedding vectors as cache keys, this mechanism effectively minimizes latency and redundant computation for semantically similar queries. In this work, we conceptualize semantic cache keys as a form of fuzzy hashes. We demonstrate that the locality required to maximize cache hit rates fundamentally conflicts with the cryptographic avalanche effect necessary for collision resistance. Our conceptual analysis formalizes this inherent trade-off between performance (locality) and security (collision resilience), revealing that semantic caching is naturally vulnerable to key collision attacks.\n  While prior research has focused on side-channel and privacy risks, we present the first systematic study of integrity risks arising from cache collisions. We introduce CacheAttack, an automated framework for launching black-box collision attacks. We evaluate CacheAttack in security-critical tasks and agentic workflows. It achieves a hit rate of 86\\% in LLM response hijacking and can induce malicious behaviors in LLM agent, while preserving strong transferability across different embedding models. A case study on a financial agent further illustrates the real-world impact of these vulnerabilities.

This challenge is especially acute in mixed-motive multi-agent systems. This work focuses on cooperative resilience, the ability of agents to anticipate, resist, recover, and transform in the face of disruptions, a critical yet underexplored property in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning. We study how reward function design influences resilience in mixed-motive settings and introduce a novel framework that learns reward functions from ranked trajectories, guided by a cooperative resilience metric. Agents are trained in a suite of social dilemma environments using three reward strategies: i) traditional individual reward; ii) resilience-inferred reward; and iii) hybrid that balance both. We explore three reward parameterizations-linear models, hand-crafted features, and neural networks, and employ two preference-based learning algorithms to infer rewards from behavioral rankings. Our results demonstrate that hybrid strategy significantly improve robustness under disruptions without degrading task performance and reduce catastrophic outcomes like resource overuse. These findings underscore the importance of reward design in fostering resilient cooperation, and represent a step toward developing robust multi-agent systems capable of sustaining cooperation in

We introduce the Six Sigma Agent, a novel architecture that achieves enterprise-grade reliability through three synergistic components: (1) task decomposition into a dependency tree of atomic actions; (2) micro-agent sampling where each task is executed n times in parallel across diverse LLMs to generate independent outputs; and (3) consensus voting with dynamic scaling, clustering outputs and selecting the answer from the winning cluster with maximum votes. We prove that sampling n independent outputs with error rate p achieves system error O(p^{ceil(n/2)}), enabling exponential reliability gains. Even using cheaper models with 5% per-action error, consensus voting with 5 agents reduces error to 0.11%; dynamic scaling to 13 agents achieves 3.4 DPMO (Defects Per Million Opportunities), the Six Sigma standard. Evaluation across three enterprise use cases demonstrates a 14,700x reliability improvement over single-agent execution while reducing costs by 80%.

Most prior methods cast this task as an optimization problem with limited theoretical grounding. We propose to cast workflow generation as Bayesian inference over a posterior distribution on workflows, and introduce \\textbf{Bayesian Workflow Generation (BWG)}, a sampling framework that builds workflows step-by-step using parallel look-ahead rollouts for importance weighting and a sequential in-loop refiner for pool-wide improvements. We prove that, without the refiner, the weighted empirical distribution converges to the target posterior. We instantiate BWG as \\textbf{BayesFlow}, a training-free algorithm for workflow construction. Across six benchmark datasets, BayesFlow improves accuracy by up to 9 percentage points over SOTA workflow generation baselines and by up to 65 percentage points over zero-shot prompting, establishing BWG as a principled upgrade to search-based workflow design.

However, current state-of-the-art systems still struggle with \"surface-level\" critiques: they excel at summarizing content but often fail to accurately assess novelty and significance or identify deep methodological flaws because they evaluate papers in a vacuum, lacking the external context a human expert possesses. In this paper, we introduce ScholarPeer, a search-enabled multi-agent framework designed to emulate the cognitive processes of a senior researcher. ScholarPeer employs a dual-stream process of context acquisition and active verification. It dynamically constructs a domain narrative using a historian agent, identifies missing comparisons via a baseline scout, and verifies claims through a multi-aspect Q&A engine, grounding the critique in live web-scale literature. We evaluate ScholarPeer on DeepReview-13K and the results demonstrate that ScholarPeer achieves significant win-rates against state-of-the-art approaches in side-by-side evaluations and reduces the gap to human-level diversity.", "AI": {"tldr": "ScholarPeer\ub294 \uc2ec\uce35 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc790\uc758 \uc778\uc9c0 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ubaa8\ubc29\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \ubb38\ub9e5 \uc218\uc9d1\uacfc \ub2a5\ub3d9 \uac80\uc99d\uc758 \uc774\uc911 \uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9bc \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 \uc790\ub3d9 \ub3d9\ub8cc \ub9ac\ubdf0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \ud45c\uba74\uc801\uc778 \ube44\ud310\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc5b4, \ub17c\ubb38\uc758 \ucc38\uc2e0\uc131\uacfc \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uc815\ud655\ud788 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "ScholarPeer\ub294 \uc5ed\uc0ac \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ub0b4\ub7ec\ud2f0\ube0c\ub97c \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uace0, \uae30\uc900 \uc2a4\uce74\uc6b0\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub204\ub77d\ub41c \ube44\uad50\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uba70, \ub2e4\uac01\uc801 Q&A \uc5d4\uc9c4\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc8fc\uc7a5\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "ScholarPeer\ub294 DeepReview-13K\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uae30\uc874 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc2b9\ub960\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uc778\uac04 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131 \uac04 \uac04\uadf9\uc744 \uc904\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "ScholarPeer\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9 \ub3d9\ub8cc \ub9ac\ubdf0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0, \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc758 \uc778\uc9c0\uc801 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \ubaa8\ubc29\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uae4a\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \ube44\ud310\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ub3d9\ub8cc \uac80\ud1a0\ub294 \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ubd84\ub958\uc5d0\uc11c \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \uc0dd\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \ubc1c\uc804\ud574\uc654\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 '\ud45c\uba74\uc801' \ube44\ud310\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uc774\ub4e4\uc740 \ub0b4\uc6a9\uc744 \uc694\uc57d\ud558\ub294 \ub370\ub294 \ud0c1\uc6d4\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ucc38\uc2e0\uc131 \ubc0f \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uae4a\uc740 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc801 \uacb0\ud568\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc2e4\ud328\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8 \uc774\uc720\ub294 \uc774\ub4e4\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc744 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uba70, \uc778\uac04 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uac00 \uac16\ub294 \uc678\ubd80 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc774 \uacb0\uc5ec\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc2ec\uce35 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc790\uc758 \uc778\uc9c0 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ubaa8\ubc29\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uac80\uc0c9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 ScholarPeer\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

We argue that this failure reflects a fundamental mismatch: step-wise reasoning induces a form of step-wise greedy policy that is adequate for short horizons but fails in long-horizon planning, where early actions must account for delayed consequences. From this planning-centric perspective, we study LLM-based agents in deterministic, fully structured environments with explicit state transitions and evaluation signals. Our analysis reveals a core failure mode of reasoning-based policies: locally optimal choices induced by step-wise scoring lead to early myopic commitments that are systematically amplified over time and difficult to recover from. We introduce FLARE (Future-aware Lookahead with Reward Estimation) as a minimal instantiation of future-aware planning to enforce explicit lookahead, value propagation, and limited commitment in a single model, allowing downstream outcomes to influence early decisions. Across multiple benchmarks, agent frameworks, and LLM backbones, FLARE consistently improves task performance and planning-level behavior, frequently allowing LLaMA-8B with FLARE to outperform GPT-4o with standard step-by-step reasoning.

While machine-learning models achieve strong performance, many fail to translate into routine clinical use due to misalignment with workflow constraints such as memorability, auditability, and bedside execution. We argue that this gap arises not from insufficient predictive power, but from optimizing over model classes that are incompatible with guideline deployment. Deployable guidelines often take the form of unit-weighted clinical checklists, formed by thresholding the sum of binary rules, but learning such scores requires searching an exponentially large discrete space of possible rule sets. We introduce AgentScore, which performs semantically guided optimization in this space by using LLMs to propose candidate rules and a deterministic, data-grounded verification-and-selection loop to enforce statistical validity and deployability constraints. Across eight clinical prediction tasks, AgentScore outperforms existing score-generation methods and achieves AUC comparable to more flexible interpretable models despite operating under stronger structural constraints. On two additional externally validated tasks, AgentScore achieves higher discrimination than established guideline-based scores.", "AI": {"tldr": "AgentScore\ub294 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc784\uc0c1 \uac00\uc774\ub4dc\ub77c\uc778\uc5d0 \uc801\ud569\ud55c \uc810\uc218 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 \uba38\uc2e0\ub7ec\ub2dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc784\uc0c1 \ub8e8\ud2f4\uc5d0 \uc798 \uc801\uc6a9\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \uc774\uc720\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0, \uc784\uc0c1 \uac00\uc774\ub4dc\ub77c\uc778\uc5d0 \uc801\ud569\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "AgentScore\ub294 LLM\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud6c4\ubcf4 \uaddc\uce59\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \uac80\uc99d \ubc0f \uc120\ud0dd \ub8e8\ud504\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \uc720\ud6a8\uc131\uacfc \ubc30\ud3ec \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \uac15\uc81c\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "AgentScore\ub294 8\uac1c\uc758 \uc784\uc0c1 \uc608\uce21 \uacfc\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \uc810\uc218 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, \ub354 \uc720\uc5f0\ud55c \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ub3d9\ub4f1\ud55c AUC\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "AgentScore\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc678\ubd80 \uac80\uc99d\ub41c \uacfc\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \uac00\uc774\ub4dc\ub77c\uc778 \uae30\ubc18 \uc810\uc218\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub192\uc740 \ubcc0\ubcc4\ub825\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368, \uc784\uc0c1 \uac00\uc774\ub4dc\ub77c\uc778\uc5d0 \ubc30\ud3ec \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc810\uc218 \uc0dd\uc131\uc758 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud604\ub300\uc758 \uc784\uc0c1 \uc2e4\ubb34\ub294 \uc18c\uc218\uc758 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uaddc\uce59\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \uac04\uacb0\ud55c \uc810\uc218 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\ud604\ub41c \uadfc\uac70 \uae30\ubc18 \uac00\uc774\ub4dc\ub77c\uc778\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uba38\uc2e0\ub7ec\ub2dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc5b5 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131, \uac10\uc0ac \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \ubc0f \uce68\ub300 \uc606 \uc2e4\ud589\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud750\ub984 \uc81c\uc57d \uc0ac\ud56d\uacfc\uc758 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ub9ce\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc77c\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \uc784\uc0c1 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\ud658\ub418\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uaca9\ucc28\uac00 \ubd88\ucda9\ubd84\ud55c \uc608\uce21\ub825 \ub54c\ubb38\uc774 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uac00\uc774\ub4dc\ub77c\uc778 \ubc30\ud3ec\uc640 \ud638\ud658\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubc30\ud3ec \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uac00\uc774\ub4dc\ub77c\uc778\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uc774\uc9c4 \uaddc\uce59\uc758 \ud569\uacc4\ub97c \uc784\uacc4\uac12\uc73c\ub85c \uc124\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \ud615\uc131\ub41c \ub2e8\uc704 \uac00\uc911\uce58 \uc784\uc0c1 \uccb4\ud06c\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc758 \ud615\ud0dc\ub97c \ucde8\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc810\uc218\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub824\uba74 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uaddc\uce59 \uc9d1\ud569\uc758 \uae30\ud558\uae09\uc218\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud070 \uc774\uc0b0 \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \uac80\uc0c9\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 LLM\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud6c4\ubcf4 \uaddc\uce59\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \uc720\ud6a8\uc131\uacfc \ubc30\ud3ec \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \uac15\uc81c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uacb0\uc815\ub860\uc801 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18 \uac80\uc99d \ubc0f \uc120\ud0dd \ub8e8\ud504\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \uc758\ubbf8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc548\ub0b4\ub41c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 AgentScore\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.

A core property of such systems is information asymmetry: agents observe task-specific information, produce intermediate reasoning traces, and operate with different context windows. In isolation, such asymmetry is not problematic, since agents report truthfully to the principal when incentives are fully aligned. However, this assumption breaks down when incentives diverge. Recent evidence suggests that LLM-based agents can acquire their own goals, such as survival or self-preservation, a phenomenon known as scheming, and may deceive humans or other agents. This leads to agency loss: a gap between the principal's intended outcome and the realized system behavior. Drawing on core ideas from microeconomic theory, we argue that these characteristics, information asymmetry and misaligned goals, are best studied through the lens of principal-agent problems. We explain why multi-agent systems, both human-to-LLM and LLM-to-LLM, naturally induce information asymmetry under this formulation, and we use scheming, where LLM agents pursue covert goals, as a concrete case study. We show that recently introduced terminology used to describe scheming, such as covert subversion or deferred subversion, corresponds to well-studied concepts in the mechanism design literature, which not only characterizes the problem but also prescribes concrete mitigation strategies.

These protocols allow multiple agents to coordinate to come to a common agreement in an environment with uncertainty and failures. We formulate protocol design as a search problem over strategies in a game with imperfect information, and the desired correctness conditions are specified in Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT). However, standard methods for solving multi-agent games fail to learn correct protocols in this setting, even when the number of agents is small. We propose a learning framework, GGMS, which integrates a specialized variant of Monte Carlo Tree Search with a transformer-based action encoder, a global depth-first search to break out of local minima, and repeated feedback from a model checker. Protocols output by GGMS are verified correct via exhaustive model checking for all executions within the bounded setting. We further prove that, under mild assumptions, the search process is complete: if a correct protocol exists, GGMS will eventually find it. In experiments, we show that GGMS can learn correct protocols for larger settings than existing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "GGMS\ub77c\ub294 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc62c\ubc14\ub978 \ubd84\uc0b0 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc124\uacc4\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc62c\ubc14\ub978 \ubd84\uc0b0 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c \uc124\uacc4\ub294 \ud604\ub300 \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec \uc694\uc18c\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub192\uc740 \ub09c\uc774\ub3c4\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\uc5d0 \uc624\ub79c \uc2dc\uac04\uc774 \uc18c\uc694\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uac8c\uc784 \uc774\ub860\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uc804\ub7b5 \uac80\uc0c9 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uace0, \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc758 \ubd88\uc644\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 Monte Carlo Tree Search \ubcc0\ud615 \ubc0f transformer \uae30\ubc18 \uc561\uc158 \uc778\ucf54\ub354\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c GGMS \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "GGMS\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd9c\ub825\ub41c \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc740 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc2e4\ud589\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ubaa8\ub378 \uccb4\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uac80\uc99d\ub418\uc5b4 \uc62c\ubc14\ub984\uc774 \ud655\ub9bd\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uac80\uc0c9 \uacfc\uc815\uc758 \uc644\uc804\uc131\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "GGMS\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud070 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc62c\ubc14\ub978 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc774 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc785\uc99d\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc99d\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubd84\uc0b0 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc740 \ud604\ub300 \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uae30 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc774\uba70 \uc885\uc885 \uc218\uc2ed \ub144\uc758 \uc778\uac04 \ub178\ub825\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc740 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uacfc \uc2e4\ud328\uac00 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\ub294 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc870\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \uacf5\ud1b5\uc758 \ud569\uc758\uc5d0 \ub3c4\ub2ec\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \ubd88\uc644\uc804\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4 \uac8c\uc784\uc758 \uc804\ub7b5 \uac80\uc0c9 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uace0, \uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \uc62c\ubc14\ub984 \uc870\uac74\uc744 SMT(Satisfiability Modulo Theories)\uc5d0 \uba85\uc2dc\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud45c\uc900 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc218\uac00 \uc801\ub354\ub77c\ub3c4 \uc774 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc62c\ubc14\ub978 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc2e4\ud328\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Monte Carlo Tree Search\uc758 \ud2b9\uc218 \ubcc0\ud615, transformer \uae30\ubc18 \uc561\uc158 \uc778\ucf54\ub354, \uc9c0\uc5ed \ucd5c\uc18c\uac12\uc744 \ubc97\uc5b4\ub098\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc804\uc5ed \uae4a\uc774 \uc6b0\uc120 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ubc0f \ubaa8\ub378 \uac80\uc0ac\uae30\ub85c\ubd80\ud130\uc758 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c GGMS\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

At scale, however, Cell Painting data is strongly affected by batch effects arising from differences in laboratories, instruments, and protocols, which can obscure biological signal. We present BALANS (Batch Alignment via Local Affinities and Subsampling), a scalable batch-correction method that aligns samples across batches by constructing a smoothed affinity matrix from pairwise distances. Given $n$ data points, BALANS builds a sparse affinity matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ using two ideas. (i) For points $i$ and $j$, it sets a local scale using the distance from $i$ to its $k$-th nearest neighbor within the batch of $j$, then computes $A_{ij}$ via a Gaussian kernel calibrated by these batch-aware local scales. (ii) Rather than forming all $n^2$ entries, BALANS uses an adaptive sampling procedure that prioritizes rows with low cumulative neighbor coverage and retains only the strongest affinities per row, yielding a sparse but informative approximation of $A$. We prove that this sampling strategy is order-optimal in sample complexity and provides an approximation guarantee, and we show that BALANS runs in nearly linear time in $n$.

A natural way to expand capability is to scale up the agent pool by continually integrating new functional agents or tool interfaces, but naive expansion can trigger performance collapse when the router cold-starts on newly added, heterogeneous, and unreliable agents. We propose MonoScale, an expansion-aware update framework that proactively generates a small set of agent-conditioned familiarization tasks, harvests evidence from both successful and failed interactions, and distills it into auditable natural-language memory to guide future routing. We formalize sequential augmentation as a contextual bandit and perform trust-region memory updates, yielding a monotonic non-decreasing performance guarantee across onboarding rounds. Experiments on GAIA and Humanity's Last Exam show stable gains as the agent pool grows, outperforming naive scale-up and strong-router fixed-pool baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "MonoScale\uc740 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uae30\ub2a5 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud1b5\ud569 \uc2dc \uc131\ub2a5 \uc800\ud558\ub97c \ubc29\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ucd5c\uadfc LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \ube60\ub974\uac8c \ubc1c\uc804\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud480\uc744 \ud655\ub300\ud558\ub294 \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7ec\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "MonoScale\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc870\uac74\ud654\ub41c \uc775\uc219\ud574\uc9c0\uae30 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uc131\uacf5\uc801 \ubc0f \uc2e4\ud328\ud55c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc758 \uc99d\uac70\ub97c \uc218\uc9d1\ud558\uc5ec, \uc774\ub97c \uac10\uc0ac \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\ub85c \uc99d\ub958\ud558\uc5ec \ubbf8\ub798\uc758 \ub77c\uc6b0\ud305\uc744 \uc548\ub0b4\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc774\ub2e4.", "result": "GAIA \ubc0f Humanity's Last Exam\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud480\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc774 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "MonoScale\uc740 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, \ub192\uc740 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud480\uc758 \uc131\uc7a5\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc \uba87 \ub144 \ub3d9\uc548 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(MAS)\uc740 \ub77c\uc6b0\ud130\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ubd84\ud574\ud558\uace0 \uc804\ubb38 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0\uac8c \ud558\uc704 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc704\uc784\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \ube60\ub974\uac8c \ubc1c\uc804\ud574\uc654\ub2e4. \uae30\ub2a5 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ub610\ub294 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\ub97c \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud480\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7ec\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5\uc740 \ub77c\uc6b0\ud130\uac00 \uc0c8\ub85c \ucd94\uac00\ub41c \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc774\uac70\ub098 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 '\ucf5c\ub4dc \uc2a4\ud0c0\ud2b8'\ud560 \ub54c \uc131\ub2a5 \ubd95\uad34\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc18c\uaddc\ubaa8\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc870\uac74\ud654\ub41c \uc775\uc219\ud574\uc9c0\uae30 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uc801\uadf9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uc131\uacf5\uc801 \ubc0f \uc2e4\ud328\ud55c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc99d\uac70\ub97c \uc218\uc9d1\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub97c \uac10\uc0ac \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\ub85c \uc99d\ub958\ud558\uc5ec \ud5a5\ud6c4 \ub77c\uc6b0\ud305\uc744 \uc548\ub0b4\ud558\ub294 \ud655\uc7a5 \uc778\uc2dd \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 MonoScale\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc21c\ucc28\uc801 \uc99d\ub300\ub97c \ub9e5\ub77d \ubc34\ub527\uc73c\ub85c \ud615\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uc2e0\ub8b0 \uc601\uc5ed \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc5ec \uc628\ubcf4\ub529 \ub77c\uc6b4\ub4dc\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e8\uc870 \ube44\uac10\uc18c \uc131\ub2a5 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uc774\ub04c\uc5b4\ub0b8\ub2e4.

We employ a hybrid methodology: AI-driven natural language verification to narrow the search space, followed by human expert evaluation to gauge correctness and novelty. We address 13 problems that were marked 'Open' in the database: 5 through seemingly novel autonomous solutions, and 8 through identification of previous solutions in the existing literature.

As policies of an MDP are uniquely determined by their occupancy measures, we propose modeling policy representations as expectations of state-action feature maps with respect to occupancy measures. We show that these representations can be approximated uniformly for a range of policies using a set-based architecture. Our model encodes a set of state-action samples into a latent embedding, from which we decode both the policy and its value functions corresponding to multiple rewards. We use variational generative approach to induce a smooth latent space, and further shape it with contrastive learning so that latent distances align with differences in value functions. This geometry permits gradient-based optimization directly in the latent space. Leveraging this capability, we solve a novel behavior synthesis task, where policies are steered to satisfy previously unseen value function constraints without additional training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4(MDP)\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ucc45 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uc5ec \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc \ud589\ub3d9 \uc9c0\ud5a5\uc744 \uc6a9\uc774\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc815\ucc45\uc774 MDP\uc758 \uc810\uc720 \uce21\uc815\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uace0\uc720\ud558\uac8c \uacb0\uc815\ub418\ubbc0\ub85c, \uc774\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \uc815\ucc45 \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc815\ucc45 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uc810\uc720 \uce21\uc815\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0c1\ud0dc-\ud589\ub3d9 \ud2b9\uc131 \ub9f5\uc758 \uae30\ub300\uac12\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uace0, \uc138\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc815\ucc45\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc774\ub97c \uade0\uc77c\ud558\uac8c \uadfc\uc0ac\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc0c1\ud0dc-\ud589\ub3d9 \uc0d8\ud50c \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \uc7a0\uc7ac \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ud558\uc5ec, \ub2e4\uc218\uc758 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc5d0 \ud574\ub2f9\ud558\ub294 \uc815\ucc45\uacfc \uac00\uce58 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \ub514\ucf54\ub4dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ucd94\uac00 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc774\uc804\uc5d0 \ubcf4\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c \uac00\uce58 \ud568\uc218 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ub9cc\uc871\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud589\ub3d9 \ud569\uc131 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4(MDP)\ub97c \uace0\ub824\ud558\uc5ec, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc \ud589\ub3d9 \uc870\uc815\uc774 \uc6a9\uc774\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc815\ucc45\uc758 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.

While memory systems provide a viable solution, existing paradigms struggle to adapt to dynamic GUI environments, suffering from a granularity mismatch between high-level intent and low-level execution, and context pollution where the static accumulation of outdated experiences drives agents into hallucination. To address these bottlenecks, we propose the Darwinian Memory System (DMS), a self-evolving architecture that constructs memory as a dynamic ecosystem governed by the law of survival of the fittest. DMS decomposes complex trajectories into independent, reusable units for compositional flexibility, and implements Utility-driven Natural Selection to track survival value, actively pruning suboptimal paths and inhibiting high-risk plans. This evolutionary pressure compels the agent to derive superior strategies. Extensive experiments on real-world multi-app benchmarks validate that DMS boosts general-purpose MLLMs without training costs or architectural overhead, achieving average gains of 18.0% in success rate and 33.9% in execution stability, while reducing task latency, establishing it as an effective self-evolving memory system for GUI tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc708 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(DMS)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec GUI \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(MLLM)\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ub3d9\uc801 GUI \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc774 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uace0\uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc758\ub3c4\uc640 \uc800\uc218\uc900 \uc2e4\ud589 \uac04\uc758 \uc138\ubd84\ud654 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58 \ubc0f \ub9e5\ub77d \uc624\uc5fc\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "DMS\ub294 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\ub97c \uc9c4\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc0dd\ud0dc\uacc4\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uba70, \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub2e8\uc704\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\uc5ec \uc720\ud2f8\ub9ac\ud2f0 \uae30\ubc18 \uc790\uc5f0 \uc120\ud0dd\uc744 \uad6c\ud604\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "DMS\ub294 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \ud3c9\uade0 18.0%, \uc2e4\ud589 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uade0 33.9% \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uba70, \uc791\uc5c5 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uace0 GUI \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc790\uac00 \uc9c4\ud654 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc784\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "DMS\ub294 \ud559\uc2b5 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774\ub098 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc \uc5c6\uc774 \ubc94\uc6a9 MLLM\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc218\ub2e8\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(MLLM) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uadf8\ub798\ud53d \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4(GUI) \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ucc3d \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc7a5\uae30 \uc9c0\ud3c9\uc120\uc758 \uad50\ucc28 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uae30\uc874 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc740 \ub3d9\uc801 GUI \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uc73c\uba70, \uace0\uc218\uc900 \uc758\ub3c4\uc640 \uc800\uc218\uc900 \uc2e4\ud589 \uac04\uc758 \uc138\ubd84\ud654 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\uc640 \uc815\uc801 \uacbd\ud5d8 \ucd95\uc801\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud658\uac01\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\ub044\ub294 \ub9e5\ub77d \uc624\uc5fc\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc548\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uc0dd\uc874 \ubc95\uce59\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\ub97c \ub3d9\uc801 \uc0dd\ud0dc\uacc4\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc790\uac00 \uc9c4\ud654 \uad6c\uc870\uc778 \ub2e4\uc708 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(DMS)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

We present a predictive theory that resolves this gap by showing that recoverability follows a measurable law. To elaborate, we formalize recoverability through Expected Recovery Regret (ERR), which quantifies the deviation of a recovery policy from the optimal one under stochastic execution noise, and derive a first-order relationship between ERR and an empirical observable quantity, the Efficiency Score (ES). This yields a falsifiable first-order quantitative law of recovery dynamics in tool-using agents. We empirically validate the law across five tool-use benchmarks spanning controlled perturbations, diagnostic reasoning, and real-world APIs. Across model scales, perturbation regimes, and recovery horizons, predicted regret under the ERR-ES law closely matched observed post-failure regret measured from Monte Carlo rollouts, within delta less than or equal to 0.05. Our results reveal that recoverability is not an artifact of model scale or architecture, but a governed property of interaction dynamics, providing a theoretical foundation for execution-level robustness in language agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc790\uac00 \ubcf5\uad6c \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud558\ub294 \uc608\uce21 \uc774\ub860\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub3c4\uad6c \ud638\ucd9c \uc2e4\ud589 \uc2e4\ud328 \ud6c4 \uc790\uac00 \ubcf5\uad6c \ub2a5\ub825\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacf5\uc2dd\uc801\uc778 \uc124\uba85\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Expected Recovery Regret (ERR)\ub77c\ub294 \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf5\uad6c \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc815\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uace0, \ubcf5\uad6c \uc815\ucc45\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801 \uc815\ucc45\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130\uc758 \ud3b8\ucc28\ub97c \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\uba70, ERR\uacfc Efficiency Score (ES) \uc0ac\uc774\uc758 1\ucc28 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uc720\ub3c4\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc774\ub860\uc740 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ubcf5\uad6c \uc5ed\ud559\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubc18\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c 1\ucc28 \uc815\ub7c9\uc801 \ubc95\uce59\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, 5\uac1c\uc758 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\ub97c \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\uc99d\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubcf5\uad6c \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uaddc\ubaa8\ub098 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc758 \uc0b0\ubb3c\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba70, \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uc5ed\ud559\uc758 \ud1b5\uc81c\ub41c \uc18d\uc131\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ub3c4\uad6c \ud638\ucd9c \uc2e4\ud589 \uc2e4\ud328 \ud6c4 \uc790\uac00 \ubcf5\uad6c\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacf5\uc2dd\uc801\uc778 \uc124\uba85\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubcf5\uad6c \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \uce21\uc815 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubc95\uce59\uc744 \ub530\ub978\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\ub294 \uc608\uce21 \uc774\ub860\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubcf5\uad6c \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 Expected Recovery Regret (ERR)\ub77c\ub294 \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc815\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uc2e4\ud589 \uc7a1\uc74c \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf5\uad6c \uc815\ucc45\uc774 \ucd5c\uc801 \uc815\ucc45\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc5bc\ub9c8\ub098 \ubc97\uc5b4\ub098\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\uace0, ERR\uacfc \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad00\ucc30 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc591\uc778 Efficiency Score (ES) \uac04\uc758 1\ucc28 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ubcf5\uad6c \uc5ed\ud559\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubc18\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c 1\ucc28 \uc815\ub7c9\uc801 \ubc95\uce59\uc744 \uc0b0\ucd9c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud1b5\uc81c\ub41c \uc12d\ub3d9, \uc9c4\ub2e8 \ucd94\ub860, \ubc0f \uc2e4\uc81c API\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uc5ec 5\uac1c\uc758 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774 \ubc95\uce59\uc744 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ubaa8\ub378 \uaddc\ubaa8, \uc12d\ub3d9 \uccb4\uacc4 \ubc0f \ubcf5\uad6c \uc9c0\ud3c9\uc744 \ub118\uc5b4\uc11c, ERR-ES \ubc95\uce59 \ud558\uc758 \uc608\uce21\ub41c \ud6c4\ud68c\ub294 \ubaac\ud14c\uce7c\ub85c \ub864\uc544\uc6c3\uc5d0\uc11c \uce21\uc815\ub41c \uc2e4\ud328 \ud6c4 \ud6c4\ud68c\uc640 \ubc00\uc811\ud558\uac8c \uc77c\uce58\ud588\uc73c\uba70, \ub378\ud0c0\ub294 0.05 \uc774\ud558\uc774\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ubcf5\uad6c \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \ubaa8\ub378 \uaddc\ubaa8\ub098 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc758 \uc0b0\ubb3c\uc774 \uc544\ub2c8\uba70, \uc5b8\uc5b4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc2e4\ud589 \uc218\uc900 \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uc5ed\ud559\uc758 \uaddc\uc81c\ub41c \uc18d\uc131\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4."}}

However, existing approaches predominantly employ a single-agent framework to generate search branches and estimate rewards during Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planning. This single-agent paradigm inherently limits exploration capabilities, often resulting in insufficient diversity among generated branches and suboptimal planning performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose Synergistic Multi-agent Planning with Heterogeneous langauge model assembly (SYMPHONY), a novel multi-agent planning framework that integrates a pool of heterogeneous language model-based agents. By leveraging diverse reasoning patterns across agents, SYMPHONY enhances rollout diversity and facilitates more effective exploration. Empirical results across multiple benchmark tasks show that SYMPHONY achieves strong performance even when instantiated with open-source LLMs deployable on consumer-grade hardware. When enhanced with cloud-based LLMs accessible via API, SYMPHONY demonstrates further improvements, outperforming existing state-of-the-art baselines and underscoring the effectiveness of heterogeneous multi-agent coordination in planning tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "SYMPHONY\ub294 \uc774\uc885 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacc4\ud68d \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uacc4\ud68d \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud568.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud558\uace0 \uacc4\ud68d \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc800\ud558\uc2dc\ud0b4\uc744 \uc54c\uac8c \ub418\uc5b4, \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc0dd\uae40.", "method": "\uc774\uc885 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud480\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \ucd94\ub860 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud568.", "result": "\uc5ec\ub7ec \uae30\uc900 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \uac70\ub450\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uc624\ud508\uc18c\uc2a4 LLM\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec\ub3c4 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud568.", "conclusion": "\ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc \uae30\ubc18 LLM\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud560 \ub54c \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ub354\uc6b1 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\uba70, \uae30\uc874 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uacc4\ud68d \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\uc885 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc870\uc815\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud568.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\ub4e4\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc5d0 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uc9d1\uc911\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ubaac\ud14c \uce74\ub97c\ub85c \ud2b8\ub9ac \uac80\uc0c9(MCTS) \uacc4\ud68d \uc911 \uac80\uc0c9 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc8fc\ub85c \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uba70, \uc774 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc740 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud558\uc5ec \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \uac00\uc9c0 \uac04\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uace0 \uacc4\ud68d \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ucd5c\uc801\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\uc885 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc870\ub9bd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \ud611\ub3d9\uc801 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uacc4\ud68d(SYMPHONY)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

This leads to a research question: Can explicit feedback on table transformation action improve model reasoning capability? In this work, we introduce RE-Tab, a plug-and-play framework that architecturally enhances trajectory search via lightweight, training-free reward modeling by formulating the problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process. We demonstrate that providing explicit verifiable rewards during State Transition (``What is the best action?'') and Simulative Reasoning (``Am I sure about the output?'') is crucial to steer the agent's navigation in table states. By enforcing stepwise reasoning with reward feedback in table transformations, RE-Tab achieves state-of-the-art performance in TableQA with almost 25\\% drop in inference cost. Furthermore, a direct plug-and-play implementation of RE-Tab brings up to 41.77% improvement in QA accuracy and 33.33% drop in test-time inference samples for consistent answer. Consistent improvement pattern across various LLMs and state-of-the-art benchmarks further confirms RE-Tab's generalisability.

Existing methods rely mainly on raw structural data and struggle to exploit the rich scientific literature. While large language models (LLMs) have been added to these pipelines, they have been confined to narrow roles within structure-centered optimizers. We instead cast biological black-box optimization as a fully agentic, language-based reasoning process. We introduce Purely Agentic BLack-box Optimization (PABLO), a hierarchical agentic system that uses scientific LLMs pretrained on chemistry and biology literature to generate and iteratively refine biological candidates. On both the standard GuacaMol molecular design and antimicrobial peptide optimization tasks, PABLO achieves state-of-the-art performance, substantially improving sample efficiency and final objective values over established baselines. Compared to prior optimization methods that incorporate LLMs, PABLO achieves competitive token usage per run despite relying on LLMs throughout the optimization loop. Beyond raw performance, the agentic formulation offers key advantages for realistic design: it naturally incorporates semantic task descriptions, retrieval-augmented domain knowledge, and complex constraints. In follow-up in vitro validation, PABLO-optimized peptides showed strong activity against drug-resistant pathogens, underscoring the practical potential of PABLO for therapeutic discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "PABLO\ub294 \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801 \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc5b8\uc5b4 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub85c \uc804\ud658\ud558\ub294 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc73c\ub85c, \ud654\ud559 \ubc0f \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559 \ubb38\ud5cc\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uacfc\ud559\uc801 LLM\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801 \ud6c4\ubcf4\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\uc81c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801 \uc124\uacc4\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub4e4\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uc8fc\ub85c \uc6d0\uc2dc \uad6c\uc870 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uace0 \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \ubb38\ud5cc\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\ub294\ub2e4.", "method": "PABLO\ub294 \uc0dd\ud654\ud559 \ubc0f \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559 \ubb38\ud5cc\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uacfc\ud559\uc801 LLM\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801 \ud6c4\ubcf4\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\uc81c\ud558\ub294 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774\ub2e4.", "result": "PABLO\ub294 GuacaMol \ubd84\uc790 \uc124\uacc4\uc640 \ud56d\uade0 \ud3a9\ud0c0\uc774\ub4dc \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \ucd5c\uc885 \ubaa9\ud45c \uac12\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uac1c\uc120\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "PABLO\ub294 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc801 \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc5ec \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc774\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uc2e4\uc81c \uac80\uc99d\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc57d\ubb3c \ub0b4\uc131 \ubcd1\uc6d0\uade0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac15\ud55c \ud65c\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\ub294 \ub4f1 \uce58\ub8cc \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801 \uc124\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc8fc\uc694 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub4e4\uc740 \uc18c\ubd84\uc790 \uc57d\ubb3c \ubc1c\uacac, \ud56d\uade0 \ud3a9\ud0c0\uc774\ub4dc \uac1c\ubc1c, \ub2e8\ubc31\uc9c8 \uacf5\ud559 \ub4f1\uc73c\ub85c, \uc774\ub294 \ubc29\ub300\ud55c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uad6c\uc870 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub85c \uc811\uadfc\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uc8fc\ub85c \uc6d0\uc2dc \uad6c\uc870 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \ubb38\ud5cc\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc774 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc5d0 \ucd94\uac00\ub418\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uad6c\uc870 \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ub3c4\uad6c \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc5ed\ud560\uc5d0 \uad6d\ud55c\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801 \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc644\uc804\ud788 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc801\uc778 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \uae30\ubc18 \ucd94\ub860 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub85c \uc804\ud658\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Purely Agentic BLack-box Optimization (PABLO)\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ud654\ud559 \ubc0f \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559 \ubb38\ud5cc\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uacfc\ud559\uc801 LLM\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801 \ud6c4\ubcf4\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\uc81c\ud558\ub294 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774\ub2e4. \ud45c\uc900 GuacaMol \ubd84\uc790 \uc124\uacc4 \ubc0f \ud56d\uade0 \ud3a9\ud0c0\uc774\ub4dc \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c PABLO\ub294 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uc885\ub798\uc758 \uae30\uc900\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \ucd5c\uc885 \ubaa9\ud45c \uac12\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf30\ub2e4.

In this work, we propose finetuning multiagent systems with per-action process rewards from AI feedback (MAPPA) to address both. Through assigning credit to individual agent actions rather than only at task completion, MAPPA enables fine-grained supervision without ground truth labels while extracting maximal training signal from each rollout. We demonstrate our approach on competition math problems and tool-augmented data analysis tasks. On unseen math problems, MAPPA achieves +5.0--17.5pp on AIME and +7.8--17.2pp on AMC. For data analysis tasks, our method improves success rate by +12.5pp while quality metrics improve by up to 30%, validating that per-action supervision can lead to improvements across different multiagent system on various domains. By addressing these challenges, our work takes a first step toward scaling multiagent systems for complex, long-horizon tasks with minimal human supervision.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8

The original paper link is: https://openreview.net/pdf?id=tdN42GTv4S The code repository link is: https://github.com/FelixChan9527/PerfGuard", "summary": "The advancement of Large Language Model (LLM)-powered agents has enabled automated task processing through reasoning and tool invocation capabilities. However, existing frameworks often operate under the idealized assumption that tool executions are invariably successful, relying solely on textual descriptions that fail to distinguish precise performance boundaries and cannot adapt to iterative tool updates. This gap introduces uncertainty in planning and execution, particularly in domains like visual content generation (AIGC), where nuanced tool performance significantly impacts outcomes. To address this, we propose PerfGuard, a performance-aware agent framework for visual content generation that systematically models tool performance boundaries and integrates them into task planning and scheduling. Our framework introduces three core mechanisms: (1) Performance-Aware Selection Modeling (PASM), which replaces generic tool descriptions with a multi-dimensional scoring system based on fine-grained performance evaluations; (2) Adaptive Preference Update (APU), which dynamically optimizes tool selection by comparing theoretical rankings with actual execution rankings; and (3) Capability-Aligned Planning Optimization (CAPO), which guides the planner to generate subtasks aligned with performance-aware strategies. Experimental comparisons against state-of-the-art methods demonstrate PerfGuard's advantages in tool selection accuracy, execution reliability, and alignment with user intent, validating its robustness and practical utility for complex AIGC tasks.

We address this communication bottleneck by introducing asynchronous updates across both parallelism axes, relaxing the co-location requirement at the expense of introducing staleness between pipeline stages and data parallel replicas. To mitigate staleness, for pipeline parallelism, we adopt a weight look-ahead approach, and for data parallelism, we introduce an asynchronous sparse averaging method equipped with an exponential moving average based correction mechanism. We provide convergence guarantees for both sparse averaging and asynchronous updates.

Post-training such agents is challenging because synthesis for high-quality multi-turn tool-use data is difficult to scale, and reinforcement learning (RL) could face noisy signals caused by user simulation, leading to degraded training efficiency. We propose a unified framework that combines a self-evolving data agent with verifier-based RL. Our system, EigenData, is a hierarchical multi-agent engine that synthesizes tool-grounded dialogues together with executable per-instance checkers, and improves generation reliability via closed-loop self-evolving process that updates prompts and workflow. Building on the synthetic data, we develop an RL recipe that first fine-tunes the user model and then applies GRPO-style training with trajectory-level group-relative advantages and dynamic filtering, yielding consistent improvements beyond SFT. Evaluated on tau^2-bench, our best model reaches 73.0% pass^1 on Airline and 98.3% pass^1 on Telecom, matching or exceeding frontier models.

As forecasting is probabilistic, developing and evaluating AI forecasters requires generating large numbers of diverse and difficult questions, and accurately resolving them. Previous efforts to automate this laborious work relied on recurring data sources (e.g., weather, stocks), limiting diversity and utility. In this work, we present a system for generating and resolving high-quality forecasting questions automatically and at scale using LLM-powered web research agents. We use this system to generate 1499 diverse, real-world forecasting questions, and to resolve them several months later. We estimate that our system produces verifiable, unambiguous questions approximately 96% of the time, exceeding the rate of Metaculus, a leading human-curated forecasting platform. We also find that our system resolves questions at approximately 95% accuracy. We verify that forecasting agents powered by more intelligent LLMs perform better on these questions (Brier score of 0.134 for Gemini 3 Pro, 0.149 for GPT-5, and 0.179 for Gemini 2.5 Flash). Finally, we demonstrate how our system can be leveraged to directly improve forecasting, by evaluating a question decomposition strategy on a generated question set, yielding a significant improvement in Brier scores (0.132 vs. 0.141).", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 AI \uc608\uce21\uc790\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uace0 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \uc608\uce21 \uc9c8\ubb38 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubc0f \ud574\uacb0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubbf8\ub798 \uc0ac\uac74\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc5d0 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc911\uc694\ud558\uba70 \uc77c\ubc18 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc758 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ucc99\ub3c4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654 \ub178\ub825\uc740 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc18c\uc2a4\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uacfc \uc720\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc6f9 \uc5f0\uad6c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \uc608\uce21 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ub300\ub7c9 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "1499\uac1c\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc2e4\uc81c \uc608\uce21 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uba87 \ub2ec \ud6c4\uc5d0 \ud574\uacb0\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uc57d 96%\uc758 \ud655\ub960\ub85c \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uba85\ud655\ud55c \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uc9c8\ubb38 \ud574\uacb0 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub294 \uc57d 95%\uc5d0 \ub2ec\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub354 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc801\uc778 LLM\ub85c \uad6c\ub3d9\ub418\ub294 \uc608\uce21 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc9c8\ubb38 \ud574\uacb0\uc5d0\uc11c \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc9c8\ubb38 \ubd84\ud574 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc5ec \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubbf8\ub798 \uc0ac\uac74\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc5d0 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc911\uc694\ud558\uba70 \uc77c\ubc18 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc758 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ucc99\ub3c4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc608\uce21\uc740 \ud655\ub960\uc801\uc774\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 AI \uc608\uce21\uc790\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uace0 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub824\uba74 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub09c\uc774\ub3c4\uc758 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \uc815\ud655\ud788 \ud574\uacb0\ud574\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uc804\uc758 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654 \uc2dc\ub3c4\ub294 \ubc18\ubcf5\ub418\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc18c\uc2a4(\uc608: \ub0a0\uc528, \uc8fc\uc2dd)\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uacfc \uc720\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc6f9 \uc5f0\uad6c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \uc608\uce21 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ub300\ub7c9 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec 1499\uac1c\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc2e4\uc81c \uc608\uce21 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uba87 \ub2ec \ud6c4\uc5d0 \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uc57d 96%\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0 \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \ubaa8\ud638\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc120\ub3c4\uc801\uc778 \uc778\uac04 \ud050\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uc608\uce21 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc778 Metaculus\uc758 \ube44\uc728\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud568\uc744 \ucd94\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc774 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc57d 95% \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub85c \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub354 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc801\uc778 LLM\ub85c \uad6c\ub3d9\ub418\ub294 \uc608\uce21 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc9c8\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c \ub354 \uc88b\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc784\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4(Brier \uc810\uc218: Gemini 3 Pro 0.134, GPT-5 0.149, Gemini 2.5 Flash 0.179). \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c, \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \uc9c8\ubb38 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c8\ubb38 \ubd84\ud574 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc5ec Brier \uc810\uc218\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \uc774\ub04c\uc5b4\ub0bc \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4(0.132 \ub300 0.141)."}}

In contrast, from a cognitive science perspective, reward learning remains overly dependent on external feedback, limiting flexibility and generalization. Although recent advances in the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, mark a significant breakthrough, these models still rely primarily on reward-centric reinforcement learning paradigms. Whether and how the well-established phenomenon of latent learning in psychology can inform or emerge within LLMs' training remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present novel findings from our experiments that LLMs also exhibit the latent learning dynamics. During an initial phase of unrewarded exploration, LLMs display modest performance improvements, as this phase allows LLMs to organize task-relevant knowledge without being constrained by reward-driven biases, and performance is further enhanced once rewards are introduced. LLMs post-trained under this two-stage exploration regime ultimately achieve higher competence than those post-trained with reward-based reinforcement learning throughout. Beyond these empirical observations, we also provide theoretical analyses for our experiments explaining why unrewarded exploration yields performance gains, offering a mechanistic account of these dynamics.

But clinical reasoning is not text generation. It is a responsibility-bound process under ambiguity, incomplete evidence, and longitudinal context. Even as benchmark scores rise, generation-centric systems still show behaviours incompatible with clinical deployment: premature closure, unjustified certainty, intent drift, and instability across multi-step decisions.\n  We argue these are structural consequences of treating medicine as next-token prediction. We formalise Clinical Contextual Intelligence (CCI) as a distinct capability class required for real-world clinical use, defined by persistent context awareness, intent preservation, bounded inference, and principled deferral when evidence is insufficient.\n  We introduce Meddollina, a governance-first clinical intelligence system designed to constrain inference before language realisation, prioritising clinical appropriateness over generative completeness. Meddollina acts as a continuous intelligence layer supporting clinical workflows while preserving clinician authority. We evaluate Meddollina using a behaviour-first regime across 16,412+ heterogeneous medical queries, benchmarking against general-purpose models, medical-tuned models, and retrieval-augmented systems.\n  Meddollina exhibits a distinct behavioural profile: calibrated uncertainty, conservative reasoning under underspecification, stable longitudinal constraint adherence, and reduced speculative completion relative to generation-centric baselines. These results suggest deployable medical AI will not emerge from scaling alone, motivating a shift toward Continuous Clinical Intelligence, where progress is measured by clinician-aligned behaviour under uncertainty rather than fluency-driven completion.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 Generative medical AI\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\uc640 Clinical Contextual Intelligence (CCI)\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70, Meddollina\ub77c\ub294 \uc784\uc0c1 \uc9c0\ub2a5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc784\uc0c1\uc801 \uc801\ud569\uc131\uc744 \uc6b0\uc120\uc2dc\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "Generative medical AI\ub294 \uc784\uc0c1 \uc9c0\ub2a5\ucc98\ub7fc \ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc9c4\uc815\ud55c \uc784\uc0c1 \ucd94\ub860\uc740 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc0dd\uc131\uc774 \uc544\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ud655\ub9bd\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 Clinical Contextual Intelligence (CCI)\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "Meddollina\ub77c\ub294 \uc784\uc0c1 \uc9c0\ub2a5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc5ec \uc5b8\uc5b4 \uc2e4\ud604 \uc804\uc5d0 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud558\uace0, \uc784\uc0c1\uc801 \uc801\ud569\uc131\uc744 \uc6b0\uc120\uc2dc\ud558\ub294 \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4 \uc911\uc2ec \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774\ub2e4.", "result": "Meddollina\ub294 16,412\uac1c \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc758\ub8cc \uc9c8\uc758\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0\uc11c \ub3c5\ud2b9\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9 \ud504\ub85c\ud544\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc0dd\uc131 \uc911\uc2ec \uae30\uc900\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ubcf4\uc218\uc801\uc778 \ucd94\ub860 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1\uc73c\ub85c \uc758\ub8cc AI\uac00 \ubc30\ud3ec\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba70, \uc784\uc0c1 \ud589\ub3d9\uacfc\uc758 \uc815\ub82c\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc9c4\uc804\uc744 \uce21\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \uc804\ud658\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "Generative medical AI\ub294 \uc784\uc0c1 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ee\uc740 \uc720\ucc3d\ud558\uace0 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc774 \ud48d\ubd80\ud574 \ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc784\uc0c1 \ucd94\ub860\uc740 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc0dd\uc131\uc774 \uc544\ub2d9\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ubaa8\ud638\uc131, \ubd88\uc644\uc804\ud55c \uc99d\uac70, \uc7a5\uae30\uc801 \ub9e5\ub77d \uc18d\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ucc45\uc784 \uc788\ub294 \uacfc\uc815\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \uc810\uc218\uac00 \uc0c1\uc2b9\ud558\ub294 \ub3d9\uc548\uc5d0\ub3c4, \uc0dd\uc131 \uc911\uc2ec \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc870\uae30 \uc885\uacb0, \ubd88\ud569\ub9ac\ud55c \ud655\uc2e0, \uc758\ub3c4 \ubcc0\ud654, \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uacb0\uc815\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubd88\uc548\uc815\uc131\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc784\uc0c1 \ubc30\uce58\uc640 \uc591\ub9bd\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubcf4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\ub97c \uc758\ub8cc\ub97c \ub2e4\uc74c \ud1a0\ud070 \uc608\uce21\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub8e8\ub294 \uac83\uc758 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uacb0\uacfc\ub77c\uace0 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Clinical Contextual Intelligence (CCI)\ub97c \uba85\ud655\ud55c \ub2a5\ub825 \ubc94\uc8fc\ub85c \ud615\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ub9e5\ub77d \uc778\uc2dd, \uc758\ub3c4 \ubcf4\uc874, \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ucd94\ub860, \uc99d\uac70\uac00 \ubd88\ucda9\ubd84\ud560 \ub54c \uc6d0\uce59\uc5d0 \uc758\ud55c \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\uc758\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \uc2e4\ud604 \uc804\uc5d0 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud558\uba70, \uc0dd\uc131\uc758 \uc644\uc804\uc131\ubcf4\ub2e4\ub294 \uc784\uc0c1\uc801 \uc801\ud569\uc131\uc744 \uc6b0\uc120\uc2dc\ud558\ub294 \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4 \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \uc784\uc0c1 \uc9c0\ub2a5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc778 Meddollina\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

In this paper, we propose a novel teacher-student framework that decouples CRL into two independent processes: training single-task teacher models through distributed RL and continually distilling them into a central generalist model. This design is motivated by the observation that RL excels at solving single tasks, while policy distillation -- a relatively stable supervised learning process -- is well aligned with large foundation models and multi-task learning. Moreover, a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture and a replay-based approach are employed to enhance the plasticity and stability of the continual policy distillation process. Extensive experiments on the Meta-World benchmark demonstrate that our framework enables efficient continual RL, recovering over 85% of teacher performance while constraining task-wise forgetting to within 10%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(CRL)\uc744 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc791\uc5c5 \uad50\uc0ac \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uc911\uc559 \uc77c\ubc18

Code available at https://github.com/doldam0/tmow", "summary": "Language model (LM)-based embodied agents are increasingly deployed in real-world settings. Yet, their adaptability remains limited in dynamic environments, where constructing accurate and flexible world models is crucial for effective reasoning and decision-making. To address this challenge, we extend the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigm to embodied agents. While conventional MoE architectures modularize knowledge into expert components with pre-trained routing, they remain rigid once deployed, making them less effective for adapting to unseen domains in dynamic environments. We therefore propose Test-time Mixture of World Models (TMoW), a framework that enhances adaptability to unseen and evolving domains. TMoW updates its routing function over world models at test time, unlike conventional MoE where the function remains fixed, enabling agents to recombine existing models and integrate new ones for continual adaptation. It achieves this through (i) multi-granular prototype-based routing, which adapts mixtures across object- to scene-level similarities, (ii) test-time refinement that aligns unseen domain features with prototypes during inference, and (iii) distilled mixture-based augmentation, which efficiently constructs new models from few-shot data and existing prototypes.

Model-based mechanisms compute prospective action values using an internal model of the environment, supporting flexible but computationally costly planning; model-free mechanisms cache value estimates and build heuristics that enable fast, efficient habitual responding; and memory-based mechanisms allow rapid adaptation from individual experience. In this work, we aim to elucidate the computational principles underlying this biological efficiency and translate them into a sampling algorithm for scalable Bayesian inference through effective exploration of the posterior distribution. More specifically, our proposed algorithm comprises three components: a model-based module that uses the target distribution for guided but computationally slow sampling; a model-free module that uses previous samples to learn patterns in the parameter space, enabling fast, reflexive sampling without directly evaluating the expensive target distribution; and an episodic-control module that supports rapid sampling by recalling specific past events (i.e., samples). We show that this approach advances Bayesian methods and facilitates their application to large-scale statistical machine learning problems. In particular, we apply our proposed framework to Bayesian deep learning, with an emphasis on proper and principled uncertainty quantification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \ud658\uacbd \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0 \uc788\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc2e0\uacbd \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc791\uc6a9 \uc6d0\ub9ac\ub97c \uc124\uba85\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc778\uac04\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \uba38\uc2e0 \ub7ec\ub2dd\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18, \ubaa8\ub378 \ud504\ub9ac, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uc5d0\ud53c\uc18c\ub4dc \uae30\ubc18 \uc81c\uc5b4\uc758 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub85c \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc9c4 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud588\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ud55c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc774 \ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ubc1c\uc804\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \uba38\uc2e0 \ub7ec\ub2dd \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc801\uc6a9\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ud2b9\ud788, \uc81c\uc548\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \uc2ec\uce35 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ub418\uc5b4 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\uc5d0 \uc911\uc810\uc744 \ub454\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc778\uac04\uc740 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc9c0\ud5a5\uc801\uc778 \uacc4\ud68d, \uc2b5\uad00\uc801\uc778 \ubc18\uc751, \uc5d0\ud53c\uc18c\ub4dc \uae30\uc5b5 \uae30\ubc18 \ud559\uc2b5 \ub4f1 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc791\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc2e0\uacbd \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud658\uacbd\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc740 \ud658\uacbd\uc758 \ub0b4\ubd80 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubbf8\ub798 \ud589\ub3d9 \uac00\uce58\ub97c \uacc4\uc0b0\ud558\uace0 \uc720\uc5f0\ud558\ub098 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ud070 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uba70, \ubaa8\ub378 \ud504\ub9ac \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc740 \uac00\uce58 \ucd94\uc815\uce58\ub97c \uc800\uc7a5\ud558\uace0 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uc5ec \ube60\ub974\uace0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc2b5\uad00\uc801 \ubc18\uc751\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uace0, \uae30\uc5b5 \uae30\ubc18 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc740 \uac1c\uc778 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc2e0\uc18d\ud55c \uc801\uc751\uc744 \ud5c8\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc758 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc6d0\ub9ac\ub97c \uc124\uba85\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ud6c4\ubd84\ud3ec \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \uc81c\uc548\ud55c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uacfc \uc5d0\ud53c\uc18c\ub4dc \uc81c\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub4c8\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c\ub2e4: \ubaa9\ud45c \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \ub290\ub9ac\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc548\ub0b4\ub418\ub294 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub4c8, \uc774\uc804 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud574 \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \uacf5\uac04\uc758 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uc5ec \ube44\uc2fc \ubaa9\ud45c \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \uc9c1\uc811 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \ube60\ub974\uace0 \ubc18\uc0ac\uc801\uc778 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud504\ub9ac \ubaa8\ub4c8, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \ud2b9\uc815 \uacfc\uac70 \uc0ac\uac74(\uc989, \uc0d8\ud50c)\uc744 \uc0c1\uae30\uc2dc\ucf1c \uc2e0\uc18d\ud55c \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\ud53c\uc18c\ub4dc \uc81c\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub4c8. \uc774 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc9c4\uc804\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \uba38\uc2e0 \ub7ec\ub2dd \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788, \uc81c\uc548\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc801\uc808\ud558\uace0 \uc6d0\uce59\uc801\uc778 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\uc5d0 \uc911\uc810\uc744 \ub450\uc5b4 \ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \uc2ec\uce35 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ub41c\ub2e4."}}

Fundamentally, our approach decouples the VLM's role as a high-capacity action proposer from the final action selection mechanism. We keep the VLM policy frozen and use it to generate a set of candidate actions for a given state. Then, a lightweight, offline-trained Q-function reranks these candidates, and the agent executes the action with the highest estimated value. The main contribution is to apply the Q-function directly during inference for immediate policy improvement, and not offline to relabel data for policy retraining. We demonstrate on the academic WebVoyager benchmark that our method significantly boosts agent success rates, improving a Qwen2.5-VL-7B agent from 38.8% to 55.7% and a proprietary GPT-4.1 agent from 82.4% to 88.8%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 VLM(\ube44\uc804-\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378)\uc758 \ube44\uc815\uc801 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ube60\ub974\uac8c \ubcc0\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c VLM\ub4e4\uc774 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "method": "VLM \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ub3d9\uacb0\ud558\uace0, \uc8fc\uc5b4\uc9c4 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud6c4\ubcf4 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c \ud6c4 \uac00\ubcbc\uc6b4 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c Q-\ud568\uc218\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 \ud6c4\ubcf4\ub4e4\uc744 \uc7ac\uc21c\uc704\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "WebVoyager \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 Qwen2.5-VL-7B \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c 38.8%\uc5d0\uc11c 55.7%\ub85c, GPT-4.1 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c 82.4%\uc5d0\uc11c 88.8%\ub85c \ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ub2dd \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Q-\ud568\uc218\ub97c \ucd94\ub860 \uacfc\uc815 \uc911 \uc9c1\uc811 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc989\uac01\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ube44\uc804-\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(VLM)\uc740 \uc6f9 \ubc0f \uc6b4\uc601 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ubc31\ubcf8\uc774 \ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc6f9\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ube60\ub974\uac8c \ubcc0\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ubc29\ub300\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378 \ud6c8\ub828\uacfc \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc218\uc9d1\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc644\ud654\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc815\ucc45 \uc7ac\ud6c8\ub828 \uc5c6\uc774 \ucd94\ub860 \uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 VLM \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 VLM\uc758 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \uace0\uc6a9\ub7c9 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc81c\uc548\uc790\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ucd5c\uc885 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc120\ud0dd \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ub9ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 VLM \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ub3d9\uacb0\ud55c \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub85c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uace0, \uc8fc\uc5b4\uc9c4 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud6c4\ubcf4 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7f0 \ub2e4\uc74c, \uac00\ubcbc\uc6b4 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5 Q-\ud568\uc218\uac00 \uc774 \ud6c4\ubcf4\ub4e4\uc744 \uc7ac\uc21c\uc704\ud654\ud558\uba70, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uac00\uc7a5 \ub192\uc740 \ucd94\uc815 \uac00\uce58\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc2e4\ud589\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc8fc\uc694 \uae30\uc5ec\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uc7ac\ub77c\ubca8\ub9c1\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uc989\uac01\uc801\uc778 \uc815\ucc45 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ucd94\ub860 \uc911\uc5d0 Q-\ud568\uc218\ub97c \uc9c1\uc811 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud559\uc220 WebVoyager \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \ub192\uc600\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, Qwen2.5-VL-7B \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c 38.8%\uc5d0\uc11c 55.7%\ub85c, \ub3c5\uc810 GPT-4.1 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c 82.4%\uc5d0\uc11c 88.8%\ub85c \uac1c\uc120\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

On the one hand, fast, data-free, and model-agnostic methods (e.g., NF4 or HQQ) offer maximum accessibility but suffer from functional collapse at extreme bit-rates below 4 bits. On the other hand, techniques leveraging calibration data or extensive recovery training achieve superior fidelity but impose high computational constraints and face uncertain robustness under data distribution shifts. We introduce EntQuant, the first framework to unite the advantages of these distinct paradigms. By matching the performance of data-dependent methods with the speed and universality of data-free techniques, EntQuant enables practical utility in the extreme compression regime. Our method decouples numerical precision from storage cost via entropy coding, compressing a 70B parameter model in less than 30 minutes.

Recent methods extract experience as flattened textual knowledge, which cannot capture procedural logic of complex subtasks. They also lack maintenance mechanisms, causing repository degradation as experience accumulates. We introduce AutoRefine, a framework that extracts and maintains dual-form Experience Patterns from agent execution histories. For procedural subtasks, we extract specialized subagents with independent reasoning and memory. For static knowledge, we extract skill patterns as guidelines or code snippets.

However, access to high-quality datasets is often limited due to privacy concerns, acquisition costs, and labeling challenges. Synthetic time series generation has emerged as a promising solution to address these constraints. In this work, we present a framework for generating synthetic time series by leveraging complex networks mappings. Specifically, we investigate whether time series transformed into Quantile Graphs (QG) -- and then reconstructed via inverse mapping -- can produce synthetic data that preserve the statistical and structural properties of the original. We evaluate the fidelity and utility of the generated data using both simulated and real-world datasets, and compare our approach against state-of-the-art Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) methods.

While existing methods typically rely on labor-intensive human demonstrations or automated model exploration to generate GUI trajectories, they lack fine-grained control over task difficulty. This fundamentally restricts learning effectiveness due to the mismatch between the training difficulty and the agent's capabilities. Inspired by how humans acquire skills through progressively challenging tasks, we propose MobileGen, a novel data generation framework that adaptively aligns training difficulty with the GUI agent's capability frontier. Specifically, MobileGen explicitly decouples task difficulty into structural (e.g., trajectory length) and semantic (e.g., task goal) dimensions. It then iteratively evaluates the agent on a curated prior dataset to construct a systematic profile of its capability frontier across these two dimensions. With this profile, the probability distribution of task difficulty is adaptively computed, from which the target difficulty for the next round of training can be sampled. Guided by the sampled difficulty, a multi-agent controllable generator is finally used to synthesize high-quality interaction trajectories along with corresponding task instructions. Extensive experiments show that MobileGen consistently outperforms existing data generation methods by improving the average performance of GUI agents by 1.57 times across multiple challenging benchmarks. This highlights the importance of capability-aligned data generation for effective mobile GUI agent training.", "AI": {"tldr": "MobileGen\uc740 GUI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud6c8\ub828

To facilitate such generalization, linear temporal logic (LTL) has recently emerged as a powerful formalism for specifying structured, temporally extended tasks to RL agents. While existing approaches to LTL-guided multi-task RL demonstrate successful generalization across LTL specifications, they are unable to generalize to unseen vocabularies of propositions (or \"symbols\"), which describe high-level events in LTL. We present PlatoLTL, a novel approach that enables policies to zero-shot generalize not only compositionally across LTL formula structures, but also parametrically across propositions. We achieve this by treating propositions as instances of parameterized predicates rather than discrete symbols, allowing policies to learn shared structure across related propositions. We propose a novel architecture that embeds and composes predicates to represent LTL specifications, and demonstrate successful zero-shot generalization to novel propositions and tasks across challenging environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub2e4\ubaa9\uc801 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc778 PlatoLTL\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\ubaa9\uc801 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec \uacfc\uc81c\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc911 \ubcf4\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubb38\uc7a5\ub4e4\uc744 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ud654\ub41c \uc220\uc5b4\uc758 \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4\ub85c \ucde8\uae09\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc815\ucc45\uc774 \uad00\ub828\ub41c \uc81c\uc548\ub4e4 \uac04\uc5d0 \uacf5\uc720\ub41c \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec LTL \uc0ac\uc591\uc744 \ud45c\ud604\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc220\uc5b4\ub97c \uc784\ubca0\ub4dc\ud558\uace0 \uc870\ud569\ud558\uba70, \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc778 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc81c\uc548\uacfc \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc778 \uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub2e4\ubaa9\uc801 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c LTL \uc0ac\uc591\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\uc758 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \ud5a5\ud6c4 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \uae30\ubc18\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub2e4\ubaa9\uc801 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc911\uc2ec \uacfc\uc81c\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc911 \ubcf4\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ucd5c\uadfc \uc120\ud615 \uc2dc\uac04 \ub17c\ub9ac(LTL)\ub294 RL \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0\uac8c \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc2dc\uac04\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ub41c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc9c0\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud3ec\uba40\ub9ac\uc998\uc73c\ub85c \ub5a0\uc62c\ub790\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 LTL \uac00\uc774\ub4dc \ub2e4\uc911 \uc791\uc5c5 RL \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 LTL \uc0ac\uc591 \uac04 \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc778 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc9c0\ub9cc, LTL\uc5d0\uc11c \uace0\uae09 \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8\ub97c \uc124\uba85\ud558\ub294 \ubcf4\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c \uc81c\uc548(\ub610\ub294 "}}

Mansourian", "Mohammad Hossein Rohban", "Hossein Sameti"], "title": "Toward IIT-Inspired Consciousness in LLMs: A Reward-Based Learning Framework", "comment": "13 pages, 8 figures, 4 tables", "summary": "The pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is a central goal in language model development, in which consciousness-like processing could serve as a key facilitator. While current language models are not conscious, they exhibit behaviors analogous to certain aspects of consciousness. This paper investigates the implementation of a leading theory of consciousness, Integrated Information Theory (IIT), within language models via a reward-based learning paradigm. IIT provides a formal, axiom-based mathematical framework for quantifying consciousness. Drawing inspiration from its core principles, we formulate a novel reward function that quantifies a text's causality, coherence and integration, characteristics associated with conscious processing. Empirically, it is found that optimizing for this IIT-inspired reward leads to more concise text generation. On out of domain tasks, careful tuning achieves up to a 31% reduction in output length while preserving accuracy levels comparable to the base model. In addition to primary task performance, the broader effects of this training methodology on the model's confidence calibration and test-time computational scaling is analyzed. The proposed framework offers significant practical advantages: it is conceptually simple, computationally efficient, requires no external data or auxiliary models, and leverages a general, capability-driven signal rather than task-specific heuristics.

By leveraging the DC structure of $r$, we can smooth out $r$ by applying Moreau envelopes to $r_1$ and $r_2$ separately. In line of DC programming, we then redistribute the concave part of the regularizer to the data fidelity and study its corresponding proximal Langevin algorithm (termed DC-LA). We establish convergence of DC-LA to the target distribution $\u03c0$, up to discretization and smoothing errors, in the $q$-Wasserstein distance for all $q \\in \\mathbb{N}^*$, under the assumption that $V$ is distant dissipative.

Traditional views assume that models trained on different data types develop specialized, non-transferable representations. However, recent evidence suggests unexpected convergence: models optimized for distinct tasks may develop similar representational geometries. We investigate whether this convergence extends to embodied action learning by training a transformer-based agent to execute goal-directed behaviors in response to natural language instructions. Using behavioral cloning on the BabyAI platform, we generated action-grounded language embeddings shaped exclusively by sensorimotor control requirements. We then compared these representations with those extracted from state-of-the-art large language models (LLaMA, Qwen, DeepSeek, BERT) and vision-language models (CLIP, BLIP). Despite substantial differences in training data, modality, and objectives, we observed robust cross-modal alignment. Action representations aligned strongly with decoder-only language models and BLIP (precision@15: 0.70-0.73), approaching the alignment observed among language models themselves. Alignment with CLIP and BERT was significantly weaker. These findings indicate that linguistic, visual, and action representations converge toward partially shared semantic structures, supporting modality-independent semantic organization and highlighting potential for cross-domain transfer in embodied AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc778\uc9c0 \uacfc\ud559\uacfc AI\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\uac00 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc774\uac70\ub098 \uacf5\uc720\ub41c \ub0b4\ubd80 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uc9c0\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ubaa9\ud45c \uc9c0\ud5a5 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ud2b8\ub79c\uc2a4\ud3ec\uba38 \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0, \uc561\uc158-\uae30\ubc18 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uad50\ucc28 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \uad00\ucc30.", "motivation": "\uc778\uc9c0 \uacfc\ud559\uacfc AI\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\uac00 \uc5b4\ub5a0\ud55c \ub0b4\ubd80 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud30c\uc545\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud2b8\ub79c\uc2a4\ud3ec\uba38 \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828\uc2dc\ucf1c \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uc9c0\uc2dc\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc9c0\ud5a5 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uace0, BabyAI \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc5d0\uc11c \ud589\ub3d9 \ubcf5\uc81c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uac10\uac01 \uc6b4\ub3d9 \uc870\uc808 \uc694\uad6c\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ud615\uc131\ub41c \uc5b8\uc5b4 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130, \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0 \ubc0f \ubaa9\ud45c \uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ucc28\uc774\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uad50\ucc28 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \uad00\ucc30\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ud589\ub3d9 \ud45c\ud604\uc740 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc BLIP\uc640 \uac15\ud55c \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc73c\ub098, CLIP \ubc0f BERT\uc640\uc758 \uc815\ub82c\uc740 \uc0c1\ub300\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc57d\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc5b8\uc5b4\uc801, \uc2dc\uac01\uc801, \ud589\ub3d9\uc801 \ud45c\ud604\uc774 \ubd80\ubd84\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uacf5\uc720\ub41c \uc758\ubbf8 \uad6c\uc870\ub85c \uc218\ub834\ud568\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\uba70, \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc870\uc9c1\uacfc \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uac04\uc758 \uad50\ucc28 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc804\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc778\uc9c0 \uacfc\ud559 \ubc0f AI\uc758 \uae30\ubcf8 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc740 \uc5b8\uc5b4, \ube44\uc804 \ubc0f \ud589\ub3d9\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\uac00 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801 \ub610\ub294 \uacf5\uc720\ub41c \ub0b4\ubd80 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294\uc9c0 \uc5ec\ubd80\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uad00\uc810\uc740 \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc720\ud615\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc804\ubb38\ud654\ub41c \ube44\uc804\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \ube44\uac00\uc5ed\uc801 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ubc1c\uc804\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4\uace0 \uac00\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ucd5c\uadfc \uc99d\uac70\ub294 \uc608\uc0c1\uce58 \ubabb\ud55c \uc218\ub834\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: \ud2b9\uc815 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \ud45c\ud604 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc744 \ubc1c\uc804\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \uc218\ub834\uc774 \uad6c\uccb4\ud654\ub41c \ud589\ub3d9 \ud559\uc2b5\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ub418\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uc9c0\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ubaa9\ud45c \uc9c0\ud5a5 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc2e4\ud589\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud2b8\ub79c\uc2a4\ud3ec\uba38 \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

This study proposes a deep learning framework for accurate gesture recognition using only two surface electromyography (sEMG) channels. The method employs a Convolutional Sparse Autoencoder (CSAE) to extract temporal feature representations directly from raw signals, eliminating the need for heuristic feature engineering. On a 6-class gesture set, our model achieved a multi-subject F1-score of 94.3% $\\pm$ 0.3%. To address subject-specific differences, we present a few-shot transfer learning protocol that improved performance on unseen subjects from a baseline of 35.1% $\\pm$ 3.1% to 92.3% $\\pm$ 0.9% with minimal calibration data. Furthermore, the system supports functional extensibility through an incremental learning strategy, allowing for expansion to a 10-class set with a 90.0% $\\pm$ 0.2% F1-score without full model retraining.

However, real-world diagnosis is an iterative inquiry where Clinicians sequentially ask questions and order tests to strategically gather information while managing cost and time. To address this, we first propose Med-Inquire, a new benchmark designed to evaluate an agent's ability to perform multi-turn diagnosis. Built upon a dataset of real-world clinical cases, Med-Inquire simulates the diagnostic process by hiding a complete patient file behind specialized Patient and Examination agents. They force the agent to proactively ask questions and order tests to gather information piece by piece. To tackle the challenges posed by Med-Inquire, we then introduce EvoClinician, a self-evolving agent that learns efficient diagnostic strategies at test time. Its core is a ''Diagnose-Grade-Evolve'' loop: an Actor agent attempts a diagnosis; a Process Grader agent performs credit assignment by evaluating each action for both clinical yield and resource efficiency; finally, an Evolver agent uses this feedback to update the Actor's strategy by evolving its prompt and memory. Our experiments show EvoClinician outperforms continual learning baselines and other self-evolving agents like memory agents.

However, existing training paradigms remain constrained: agents often traverse long-horizon sequences of memory operations before receiving sparse and delayed rewards, which hinders truly end-to-end optimization of memory management policies. To address this limitation, we introduce Mem-T, an autonomous memory agent that interfaces with a lightweight hierarchical memory database to perform dynamic updates and multi-turn retrieval over streaming inputs. To effectively train long-horizon memory management capabilities, we further propose MoT-GRPO, a tree-guided reinforcement learning framework that transforms sparse terminal feedback into dense, step-wise supervision via memory operation tree backpropagation and hindsight credit assignment, thereby enabling the joint optimization of memory construction and retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mem-T is (1) high-performing, surpassing frameworks such as A-Mem and Mem0 by up to $14.92\\%$, and (2) economical, operating on a favorable accuracy-efficiency

On Hallucination Evaluation in Full Research Trajectory", "comment": null, "summary": "Diagnosing the failure mechanisms of Deep Research Agents (DRAs) remains a critical challenge. Existing benchmarks predominantly rely on end-to-end evaluation, obscuring critical intermediate hallucinations, such as flawed planning, that accumulate throughout the research trajectory. To bridge this gap, we propose a shift from outcome-based to process-aware evaluation by auditing the full research trajectory. We introduce the PIES Taxonomy to categorize hallucinations along functional components (Planning vs. Summarization) and error properties (Explicit vs. Implicit). We instantiate this taxonomy into a fine-grained evaluation framework that decomposes the trajectory to rigorously quantify these hallucinations. Leveraging this framework to isolate 100 distinctively hallucination-prone tasks including adversarial scenarios, we curate DeepHalluBench. Experiments on six state-of-theart DRAs reveal that no system achieves robust reliability. Furthermore, our diagnostic analysis traces the etiology of these failures to systemic deficits, specifically hallucination propagation and cognitive biases, providing foundational insights to guide future architectural optimization.

However, these methods typically rely on absolute numerical rewards, introducing intrinsic limitations. In verifiable tasks, identical group evaluations often result in sparse supervision, while in open-ended scenarios, the score range instability of reward models undermines advantage estimation based on group means. To address these limitations, we propose Reinforcement Learning with Relative Rewards (RLRR), a framework that shifts reward shaping from absolute scoring to relative ranking. Complementing this framework, we introduce the Ranking Reward Model, a listwise preference model tailored for group-based optimization to directly generate relative rankings. By transforming raw evaluations into robust relative signals, RLRR effectively mitigates signal sparsity and reward instability. Experimental results demonstrate that RLRR yields consistent performance improvements over standard group-based baselines across reasoning benchmarks and open-ended generation tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc0c1\ub300 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RLRR) framework\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uadf8\ub8f9 \uae30\ubc18 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b4.", "motivation": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc694\uc18c\uac00 \ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uadf8\ub8f9 \uae30\ubc18 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uc808\ub300\uc801\uc778 \uc218\uce58 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \ud55c\uacc4\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc0c1\ub300 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 RLRR\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud615\uc131\uc744 \uc808\ub300 \uc810\uc218\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c1\ub300 \uc21c\uc704\ub85c \uc804\ud658\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uadf8\ub8f9 \uae30\ubc18 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \uc120\ud638 \ubaa8\ub378\uc778 Ranking Reward Model\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, RLRR\uc740 \ucd94\ub860 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc640 \uc5f4\ub9b0 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud45c\uc900 \uadf8\ub8f9 \uae30\ubc18 \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "RLRR\uc740 \uc2e0\ud638 \ud76c\uc18c\uc131\uacfc \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubd88\uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc644\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uae30\ucd08\uac00 \ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.

This setting complicates assurance, because behavior depends on nondeterministic environments and probabilistic model outputs. Prior work introduced runtime verification for agentic AI via Dynamic Probabilistic Assurance (DPA), learning an MDP online and model checking quantitative properties. A key limitation is that developers must manually define the state abstraction, which couples verification to application-specific heuristics and increases adoption friction. This paper proposes TriCEGAR, a trace-driven abstraction mechanism that automates state construction from execution logs and supports online construction of an agent behavioral MDP. TriCEGAR represents abstractions as predicate trees learned from traces and refined using counterexamples. We describe a framework-native implementation that (i) captures typed agent lifecycle events, (ii) builds abstractions from traces, (iii) constructs an MDP, and (iv) performs probabilistic model checking to compute bounds such as Pmax(success) and Pmin(failure). We also show how run likelihoods enable anomaly detection as a guardrailing signal.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc2e4\ud589 \ub85c\uadf8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud558\ub294 TriCEGAR\ub77c\ub294 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc218\ub3d9 \uc0c1\ud0dc \ucd94\uc0c1\uc744 \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud568.", "method": "TriCEGAR\ub294 \uc2e4\ud589 \ub85c\uadf8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud589\ub3d9 MDP\ub97c \uc628\ub77c\uc778\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uae30\ubc95\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "TriCEGAR\ub294 \uc2e4\ud589 \ub85c\uadf8\uc5d0\uc11c \ud559\uc2b5\ud55c \uc220\uc5b4 \ud2b8\ub9ac\ub85c \ucd94\uc0c1\uc744 \ud45c\ud604\ud558\uba70, \uc774 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc18\ub840\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\uc81c\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uae30\ubc95\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ub77c\uc774\ud504\uc0ac\uc774\ud074 \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8\ub97c \ucea1\ucc98\ud558\uace0, \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uace0, MDP\ub97c \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uba70, \ud655\ub960\uc801 \ubaa8\ub378 \uac80\uc0ac\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc5ec \uc131\uacf5 \ubc0f \uc2e4\ud328\uc758 \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \uacc4\uc0b0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\uba70 \uae34 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uae30\ub85d \ub3d9\uc548 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubc1c\uc804\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud589\ub3d9\uc774 \ube44\uacb0\uc815\ub860\uc801 \ud658\uacbd\uacfc \ud655\ub960\uc801 \ubaa8\ub378 \ucd9c\ub825\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc774 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud574\uc9d1\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uc804 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801 \ud655\ub960 \ubcf4\uc99d(DPA)\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 AI\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub7f0\ud0c0\uc784 \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \uc120\ubcf4\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc628\ub77c\uc778\uc73c\ub85c MDP\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uace0 \uc815\ub7c9\uc801 \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378 \uac80\uc99d\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc8fc\uc694 \ud55c\uacc4\ub294 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc790\uac00 \uc0c1\ud0dc \ucd94\uc0c1\uc744 \uc218\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\uc758\ud574\uc57c \ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uac80\uc99d\uc774 \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158 \ud2b9\uc815 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1\uc5d0 \uacb0\ud569\ub418\uace0 \ub3c4\uc785 \ub9c8\ucc30\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc2e4\ud589 \ub85c\uadf8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c1\ud0dc \uad6c\uc131\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ucd94\uc801 \uae30\ubc18 \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc778 TriCEGAR\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

This miscalibration is exacerbated by preference-based alignment methods breaking the link between predictive probability and correctness. We introduce a Calibration Aware Token-level Training Objective (CATTO), a calibration-aware objective that aligns predicted confidence with empirical prediction correctness, which can be combined with the original preference optimization objectives. Empirically, CATTO reduces Expected Calibration Error (ECE) by 2.22%-7.61% in-distribution and 1.46%-10.44% out-of-distribution compared to direct preference optimization (DPO), and by 0.22%-1.24% in-distribution and 1.23%-5.07% out-of-distribution compared to the strongest DPO baseline. This improvement in confidence does not come at a cost of losing task accuracy, where CATTO maintains or slightly improves multiple-choice question-answering accuracy on five datasets.

CoT is also a powerful tool for monitoring the behaviours of these agents: when faithful, they offer interpretations of the model's decision making process, and an early warning sign for dangerous behaviours. However, optimisation pressures placed on the CoT may cause the model to obfuscate reasoning traces, losing this beneficial property. We show that obfuscation can generalise across tasks; models that learn to obfuscate reasoning involving reward hacking (e.g. accessing and utilising leaked information) generalise both the reward hacking behaviour and its obfuscation in CoT to unseen reward hacking settings. Most worryingly, we show that obfuscation of CoT reasoning, and its generalisation across tasks, also follows when we penalise only the model's final actions after closing its CoT.

Speculative decoding (SD) offers a powerful solution, providing significant speed-ups through its lightweight drafting and parallel verification mechanism. While existing work has nearly saturated improvements in draft effectiveness and efficiency, this paper advances SD from a new yet critical perspective: the verification cost. We propose TriSpec, a novel ternary SD framework that, at its core, introduces a lightweight proxy to significantly reduce computational cost by approving easily verifiable draft sequences and engaging the full target model only when encountering uncertain tokens. TriSpec can be integrated with state-of-the-art SD methods like EAGLE-3 to further reduce verification costs, achieving greater acceleration. Extensive experiments on the Qwen3 and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen/LLaMA families show that TriSpec achieves up to 35\\% speedup over standard SD, with up to 50\\% fewer target model invocations while maintaining comparable accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "TriSpec\uc740 \uacbd\ub7c9 \ud504\ub85d\uc2dc\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uac80\uc99d \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uace0 \uc18d\ub3c4\ub97c \ub192\uc774\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud2b8\ub9ac\ub108\ub9ac \uc2a4\ud399\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLMs\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc740 \uc21c\ucc28\uc801, \uc790\uae30\ud68c\uadc0\uc801 \uc0dd\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc81c\ud55c\ub418\uba70, \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud574\uc9c8\uc218\ub85d \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \ub354\uc6b1 \ub450\ub4dc\ub7ec\uc9c4\ub2e4.", "method": "TriSpec\uc740 \ud655\uc778\uc774 \uc6a9\uc774\ud55c \ucd08\uc548 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\ub97c \uc2b9\uc778\ud558\uace0 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud55c \ud1a0\ud070\uc5d0\ub9cc \uc804\uccb4 \ubaa9\ud45c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ub7c9 \ud504\ub85d\uc2dc\ub97c \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc0bc\uc9c4 SD \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "result": "TriSpec\uc740 \uae30\uc874 SD\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ucd5c\ub300 35% \uc18d\ub3c4 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uacfc 50% \uc801\uc740 \ubaa9\ud45c \ubaa8\ub378 \ud638\ucd9c\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "TriSpec\uc740 \ube60\ub978 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uae30\uc874\uc758 SD \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc \ud1b5\ud569\ub418\uc5b4 \uac80\uc99d \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \ub354\uc6b1 \uc904\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc740 \uc8fc\ub85c \uc21c\ucc28\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc790\uac00 \ud68c\uadc0\uc801\uc778 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc81c\ud55c\ub418\uba70, \ucd94\ub860\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \ub418\uace0 \uc751\ub2f5 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\uac00 \uae38\uc5b4\uc9c8\uc218\ub85d \uc774 \uac19\uc740 \uc81c\uc57d\uc774 \ub354\uc6b1 \ub450\ub4dc\ub7ec\uc9c4\ub2e4. \uc2a4\ud399\ud074 \ub514\ucf54\ub529(SD)\uc740 \uacbd\ub7c9 \ub4dc\ub798\ud504\ud305 \ubc0f \ubcd1\ub82c \uac80\uc99d \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc18d\ub3c4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc5ec \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \uc791\uc5c5\uc740 \ub4dc\ub798\ud504\ud2b8\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uacfc \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \uac1c\uc120\uc774 \uac70\uc758 \ud3ec\ud654 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0 \uc774\ub974\ub800\uc73c\ub098, \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 SD\ub97c \uac80\uc99d \ube44\uc6a9\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc804\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc27d\uac8c \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub4dc\ub798\ud504\ud2b8 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\ub97c \uc2b9\uc778\ud558\uace0 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud55c \ud1a0\ud070\uc744 \ub9cc\ub0ac\uc744 \ub54c\ub9cc \uc804\uccb4 \ubaa9\ud45c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ub7c9 \ud504\ub85d\uc2dc\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc0bc\uc9c4 SD \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 TriSpec\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

However, this over-optimization often prioritizes compliance, making models vulnerable to harmful prompts. To mitigate this safety degradation, recent approaches rely on external teacher distillation, yet this introduces a distributional discrepancy that degrades native reasoning. We propose ThinkSafe, a self-generated alignment framework that restores safety alignment without external teachers. Our key insight is that while compliance suppresses safety mechanisms, models often retain latent knowledge to identify harm. ThinkSafe unlocks this via lightweight refusal steering, guiding the model to generate in-distribution safety reasoning traces. Fine-tuning on these self-generated responses effectively realigns the model while minimizing distribution shift. Experiments on DeepSeek-R1-Distill and Qwen3 show ThinkSafe significantly improves safety while preserving reasoning proficiency. Notably, it achieves superior safety and comparable reasoning to GRPO, with significantly reduced computational cost.

In this work, we prove exact learnability results for graph algorithms under bounded-degree and finite-precision constraints. Our approach follows a two-step process. First, we train an ensemble of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) to execute the local instructions of a single node. Second, during inference, we use the trained MLP ensemble as the update function within a graph neural network (GNN). Leveraging Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory, we show that local instructions can be learned from a small training set, enabling the complete graph algorithm to be executed during inference without error and with high probability. To illustrate the learning power of our setting, we establish a rigorous learnability result for the LOCAL model of distributed computation. We further demonstrate positive learnability results for widely studied algorithms such as message flooding, breadth-first and depth-first search, and Bellman-Ford.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ub3c4\uc804\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ud559\uc2b5 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc774 \ubb34\uc5c7\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0, \ud2b9\ud788 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \uc2e4\ud589 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ub3c4\uc804\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub2e4\uce35 \ud37c\uc149\ud2b8\ub860 \uc559\uc0c1\ube14\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e8\uc77c \ub178\ub4dc\uc758 \uc9c0\uc5ed \uc9c0\uc2dc\ub97c \uc2e4\ud589\ud558\uace0,Inference \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c MLP \uc559\uc0c1\ube14\uc744 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \ub0b4 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8 \ud568\uc218\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc18c\uaddc\ubaa8 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc138\ud2b8\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc9c0\uc5ed \uc9c0\uc2dc\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc624\ub958 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc804\uccb4 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc2e4\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc9c0\uc5ed \uacc4\uc0b0\uc758 LOCAL \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \ud559\uc2b5 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc218\ub9bd\ud558\uace0, \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0 \ud50c\ub85c\ub529, \ub113\uc774 \uc6b0\uc120 \ud0d0\uc0c9, \uae4a\uc774 \uc6b0\uc120 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ubc0f \ubca8\ub9cc-\ud3ec\ub4dc\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \uae0d\uc815\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc774 \ubb34\uc5c7\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0, \ud2b9\ud788 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc2e4\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uacfc\uc81c\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ucc28\uc218\uc640 \uc720\ud55c \uc815\ubc00\ub3c4 \uc81c\uc57d \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ud559\uc2b5 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc99d\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ub450 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub85c \ub098\ub269\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uccab\uc9f8, \ub2e8\uc77c \ub178\ub4dc\uc758 \uc9c0\uc5ed \uc9c0\uc2dc\ub97c \uc2e4\ud589\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub2e4\uce35 \ud37c\uc149\ud2b8\ub860(MLP) \uc559\uc0c1\ube14\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub458\uc9f8, \ucd94\ub860 \uc911\uc5d0 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c MLP \uc559\uc0c1\ube14\uc744 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(GNN) \ub0b4 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8 \ud568\uc218\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e0\uacbd \uc811\uc120 \ucee4\ub110(NTK) \uc774\ub860\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \uc18c\uaddc\ubaa8 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc138\ud2b8\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc9c0\uc5ed \uc9c0\uc2dc\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5b4, \ucd94\ub860 \uc911\uc5d0 \uc624\ub958 \uc5c6\uc774 \ub192\uc740 \ud655\ub960\ub85c \uc804\uccb4 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc2e4\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc124\uc815\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \ubd84\uc0b0 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc758 LOCAL \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \ud559\uc2b5 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc218\ub9bd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0 \uc804\uc1a1, \ub113\uc774 \uc6b0\uc120 \ubc0f \uae4a\uc774 \uc6b0\uc120 \ud0d0\uc0c9, \ubca8\ub9cc-\ud3ec\ub4dc\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ub110\ub9ac \uc5f0\uad6c\ub41c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uae0d\uc815\uc801\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ub354 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Due to their large size, they are often accessed in the cloud, limiting their application in offline games. Many of these practical issues are solved by pivoting to small language models (SLMs), but existing studies using SLMs have resulted in poor output quality. We propose a strategy of achieving high-quality SLM generation through aggressive fine-tuning on deliberately scoped tasks with narrow context, constrained structure, or both. In short, more difficult tasks require narrower scope and higher specialization to the training corpus. Training data is synthetically generated via a DAG-based approach, grounding models in the specific game world. Such models can form the basis for agentic networks designed around the narratological framework at hand, representing a more practical and robust solution than cloud-dependent LLMs. To validate this approach, we present a proof-of-concept focusing on a single specialized SLM as the fundamental building block. We introduce a minimal RPG loop revolving around rhetorical battles of reputations, powered by this model. We demonstrate that a simple retry-until-success strategy reaches adequate quality (as defined by an LLM-as-a-judge scheme) with predictable latency suitable for real-time generation. While local quality assessment remains an open question, our results demonstrate feasibility for real-time generation under typical game engine constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc791\uc740 \uc5b8\uc5b4

Batley", "Sourav Saha"], "title": "Agile Reinforcement Learning through Separable Neural Architecture", "comment": null, "summary": "Deep reinforcement learning (RL) is increasingly deployed in resource-constrained environments, yet the go-to function approximators - multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) - are often parameter-inefficient due to an imperfect inductive bias for the smooth structure of many value functions. This mismatch can also hinder sample efficiency and slow policy learning in this capacity-limited regime. Although model compression techniques exist, they operate post-hoc and do not improve learning efficiency. Recent spline-based separable architectures - such as Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) - have been shown to offer parameter efficiency but are widely reported to exhibit significant computational overhead, especially at scale.\n  In seeking to address these limitations, this work introduces SPAN (SPline-based Adaptive Networks), a novel function approximation approach to RL. SPAN adapts the low rank KHRONOS framework by integrating a learnable preprocessing layer with a separable tensor product B-spline basis. SPAN is evaluated across discrete (PPO) and high-dimensional continuous (SAC) control tasks, as well as offline settings (Minari/D4RL). Empirical results demonstrate that SPAN achieves a 30-50% improvement in sample efficiency and 1.3-9 times higher success rates across benchmarks compared to MLP baselines. Furthermore, SPAN demonstrates superior anytime performance and robustness to hyperparameter variations, suggesting it as a viable, high performance alternative for learning intrinsically efficient policies in resource-limited settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "SPAN\uc740 \uc790\uc6d0 \uc81c\uc57d \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc815\ucc45 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud568\uc218 \uadfc\uc0ac \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc790\uc6d0 \uc81c\uc57d \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uae4a\uc740 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ud65c\uc6a9\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub2e4\uce35 \ud37c\uc149\ud2b8\ub860\uc740 \uac00\uce58 \ud568\uc218\uc758 \ubd80\ub4dc\ub7ec\uc6b4 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc720\ub3c4 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc774 \ubd88\uc644\uc804\ud558\uc5ec \uc790\uc8fc \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub294 \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uc800\ud574\ud558\uace0 \uc815\ucc45 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ub290\ub9ac\uac8c \ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "SPAN\uc740 \ud559\uc2b5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc804\ucc98\ub9ac \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\ub97c \ubd84\ub9ac \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud150\uc11c \uc0dd\uc0b0 B-\uc2a4\ud50c\ub77c\uc778 \uae30\ucd08\uc640 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec KHRONOS \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc800\ub7ad\ud06c\ub85c \uc801\uc751\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "result": "SPAN\uc740 \uae30\uc900 \ub2e4\uce35 \ud37c\uc149\ud2b8\ub860\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc774 30-50% \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\uc5c8\uace0 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc774 1.3-9\ubc30 \ub192\uc558\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "SPAN\uc740 \uc790\uc6d0 \uc81c\uc57d \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc815\ucc45 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uace0\uc131\ub2a5 \ub300\uc548\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uc548\ub41c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uae4a\uc740 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc740 \uc790\uc6d0 \uc81c\uc57d \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc774 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub2e4\uce35 \ud37c\uc149\ud2b8\ub860(MLP)\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uae30\ubcf8 \ud568\uc218 \uadfc\uc0ac\uae30\ub4e4\uc740 \ub9ce\uc740 \uac00\uce58 \ud568\uc218\uc758 \ubd80\ub4dc\ub7ec\uc6b4 \uad6c\uc870\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubd88\uc644\uc804\ud55c \uc720\ub3c4 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc885\uc885 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc774 \ub5a8\uc5b4\uc9c4\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub294 \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uc800\ud574\ud558\uace0 \uc774 \uc6a9\ub7c9 \uc81c\ud55c \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ucc45 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ub290\ub9ac\uac8c \ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubaa8\ub378 \uc555\ucd95 \uae30\uc220\uc774 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uae30\uc220\uc740 \uc0ac\ud6c4\uc5d0 \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\uba70 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc \uc2a4\ud50c\ub77c\uc778 \uae30\ubc18 \ubd84\ub9ac \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98(\uc608: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN))\ub294 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc804\ubb38\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uaddc\ubaa8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc774\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub110\ub9ac \ubcf4\uace0\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc774 \uc791\uc5c5\uc740 SPAN(SPline-based Adaptive Networks)\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4.
