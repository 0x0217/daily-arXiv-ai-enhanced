This creates a need for frameworks and approaches that are\ncapable of taking advantage of on-device hardware. The MLX framework was\ncreated to address this need. It is a framework optimized for machine learning\n(ML) computations on Apple silicon devices, facilitating easier research,\nexperimentation, and prototyping.\n  This paper presents a performance evaluation of MLX, focusing on inference\nlatency of transformer models. We compare the performance of different\ntransformer architecture implementations in MLX with their Pytorch\ncounterparts. For this research we create a framework called MLX-transformers\nwhich includes different transformer implementations in MLX and downloads the\nmodel checkpoints in pytorch and converts it to the MLX format. By leveraging\nthe advanced architecture and capabilities of Apple Silicon, MLX-Transformers\nenables seamless execution of transformer models directly sourced from Hugging\nFace, eliminating the need for checkpoint conversion often required when\nporting models between frameworks.\n  Our study benchmarks different transformer models on two Apple Silicon\nmacbook devices against an NVIDIA CUDA GPU. Specifically, we compare the\ninference latency performance of models with the same parameter sizes and\ncheckpoints. We evaluate the performance of BERT, RoBERTa, and XLM-RoBERTa\nmodels, with the intention of extending future work to include models of\ndifferent modalities, thus providing a more comprehensive assessment of MLX's\ncapabilities. The results highlight MLX's potential in enabling efficient and\nmore accessible on-device ML applications within Apple's ecosystem."}

Its benefits are evident in areas such as\ntransportation, where the integration of traffic data, weather forecasts, and\nsafety sensors enables dynamic rerouting and a faster response to hazards.\nHowever, its deployment across heterogeneous smart city ecosystems raises\ncritical governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) challenges, including\naccountability, data privacy, and regulatory alignment within decentralized\ninfrastructures. Evaluation of SORA-ATMAS with three domain agents (Weather,\nTraffic, and Safety) demonstrated that its governance policies, including a\nfallback mechanism for high-risk scenarios, effectively steer multiple LLMs\n(GPT, Grok, DeepSeek) towards domain-optimized, policy-aligned outputs,\nproducing an average MAE reduction of 35% across agents. Results showed stable\nweather monitoring, effective handling of high-risk traffic plateaus 0.85, and\nadaptive trust regulation in Safety/Fire scenarios 0.65.

Although obtaining tight bounds remains challenging, such\nmeasures are often assumed to reproduce qualitative generalization trends. In\nthis position paper, we argue that many post-mortem generalization measures --\nthose computed on trained networks -- are \\textbf{fragile}: small training\nmodifications that barely affect the underlying DNN can substantially change a\nmeasure's value, trend, or scaling behavior. For example, minor hyperparameter\nchanges, such as learning rate adjustments or switching between SGD variants\ncan reverse the slope of a learning curve in widely used generalization\nmeasures like the path norm. We also identify subtler forms of fragility. For\ninstance, the PAC-Bayes origin measure is regarded as one of the most reliable,\nand is indeed less sensitive to hyperparameter tweaks than many other measures.\nHowever, it completely fails to capture differences in data complexity across\nlearning curves. This data fragility contrasts with the function-based\nmarginal-likelihood PAC-Bayes bound, which does capture differences in\ndata-complexity, including scaling behavior, in learning curves, but which is\nnot a post-mortem measure. Beyond demonstrating that many bounds -- such as\npath, spectral and Frobenius norms, flatness proxies, and deterministic\nPAC-Bayes surrogates -- are fragile, this position paper also argues that\ndevelopers of new measures should explicitly audit them for fragility."}

This creates a need for frameworks and approaches that are\ncapable of taking advantage of on-device hardware. The MLX framework was\ncreated to address this need. It is a framework optimized for machine learning\n(ML) computations on Apple silicon devices, facilitating easier research,\nexperimentation, and prototyping.\n  This paper presents a performance evaluation of MLX, focusing on inference\nlatency of transformer models. We compare the performance of different\ntransformer architecture implementations in MLX with their Pytorch\ncounterparts. For this research we create a framework called MLX-transformers\nwhich includes different transformer implementations in MLX and downloads the\nmodel checkpoints in pytorch and converts it to the MLX format. By leveraging\nthe advanced architecture and capabilities of Apple Silicon, MLX-Transformers\nenables seamless execution of transformer models directly sourced from Hugging\nFace, eliminating the need for checkpoint conversion often required when\nporting models between frameworks.\n  Our study benchmarks different transformer models on two Apple Silicon\nmacbook devices against an NVIDIA CUDA GPU. Specifically, we compare the\ninference latency performance of models with the same parameter sizes and\ncheckpoints. We evaluate the performance of BERT, RoBERTa, and XLM-RoBERTa\nmodels, with the intention of extending future work to include models of\ndifferent modalities, thus providing a more comprehensive assessment of MLX's\ncapabilities. The results highlight MLX's potential in enabling efficient and\nmore accessible on-device ML applications within Apple's ecosystem."}
