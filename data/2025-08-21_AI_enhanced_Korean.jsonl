However, current agentic ecosystems remain\nfragmented and closed. Establishing an interconnected and scalable paradigm for\nAgentic AI has become a critical prerequisite. Although Agentic Web proposes an\nopen architecture to break the ecosystem barriers, its implementation still\nfaces core challenges such as privacy protection, data management, and value\nmeasurement. Existing centralized or semi-centralized paradigms suffer from\ninherent limitations, making them inadequate for supporting large-scale,\nheterogeneous, and cross-domain autonomous interactions. To address these\nchallenges, this paper introduces the blockchain-enabled trustworthy Agentic\nWeb (BetaWeb). By leveraging the inherent strengths of blockchain, BetaWeb not\nonly offers a trustworthy and scalable infrastructure for LaMAS but also has\nthe potential to advance the Web paradigm from Web3 (centered on data\nownership) towards Web3.5, which emphasizes ownership of agent capabilities and\nthe monetization of intelligence. Beyond a systematic examination of the\nBetaWeb framework, this paper presents a five-stage evolutionary roadmap,\noutlining the path of LaMAS from passive execution to advanced collaboration\nand autonomous governance. We also conduct a comparative analysis of existing\nproducts and discuss key challenges of BetaWeb from multiple perspectives.\nUltimately, we argue that deep integration between blockchain and LaMAS can lay\nthe foundation for a resilient, trustworthy, and sustainably incentivized\ndigital ecosystem.

We introduce COCO (Cognitive Operating\nSystem with Continuous Oversight), a theoretically-grounded framework that\nimplements asynchronous self-monitoring and adaptive error correction in\nmulti-agent driven systems. COCO addresses the fundamental trade-off between\nquality assurance and computational efficiency through a novel decoupled\narchitecture that separates error detection from the critical execution path,\nachieving $O(1)$ monitoring overhead relative to workflow complexity. COCO\nemploys three key algorithmic innovations to address systematic and stochastic\nerrors: (1) Contextual Rollback Mechanism - a stateful restart protocol that\npreserves execution history and error diagnostics, enabling informed\nre-computation rather than naive retry; (2) Bidirectional Reflection Protocol -\na mutual validation system between monitoring and execution modules that\nprevents oscillatory behavior and ensures convergence; (3) Heterogeneous\nCross-Validation - leveraging model diversity to detect systematic biases and\nhallucinations through ensemble disagreement metrics.

However, their robustness under prompt\ninjection attacks, where malicious instructions are embedded into the content\nto manipulate outputs, remains a significant concern. In this work, we explore\na frustratingly simple yet effective attack setting to test whether LLMs can be\neasily misled.

However, most existing\nmulti-agent systems are built upon manual prompt/workflow engineering with\nsophisticated agent frameworks, making them computationally inefficient, less\ncapable, and can not benefit from data-centric learning. In this work, we\nintroduce Chain-of-Agents (CoA), a novel paradigm of LLM reasoning that enables\nnative end-to-end complex problem-solving in the same way as a multi-agent\nsystem (i.e., multi-turn problem solving with multiple tools and multiple\nagents) within one model. In chain-of-agents problem-solving, the model\ndynamically activates different tool agents and role-playing agents to simulate\nmulti-agent collaboration in an end-to-end fashion. To elicit end-to-end\nchain-of-agents problem-solving abilities in LLMs, we introduce a multi-agent\ndistillation framework to distill state-of-the-art multi-agent systems into\nchain-of-agents trajectories for agentic supervised fine-tuning. We then use\nagentic reinforcement learning on verifiable agentic tasks to further improve\nthe models' capabilities on chain-of-agents problem solving. We call the\nresulting models Agent Foundation Models (AFMs). Our empirical studies\ndemonstrate that AFM establishes new state-of-the-art performance across\ndiverse benchmarks in both web agent and code agent settings.

A\nmulti-stage graph consists of nodes partitioned into $K$ disjoint sets (stages)\nstructured as a sequence of weighted bipartite graphs formed across adjacent\nstages. The goal is to assign node-disjoint paths to $n$ agents starting from\nthe first stage and ending in the last stage. We show that an efficient\nassignment that minimizes the overall sum of costs of all the agents' paths may\nbe highly unfair and lead to significant cost disparities (envy) among the\nagents. We further show that finding an envy-minimizing assignment on a\nmulti-stage graph is NP-hard. We propose the C-Balance algorithm, which\nguarantees envy that is bounded by $2M$ in the case of two agents, where $M$ is\nthe maximum edge weight. We demonstrate the algorithm's tightness by presenting\nan instance where the envy is $2M$. We further show that the cost of fairness\n($CoF$), defined as the ratio of the cost of the assignment given by the fair\nalgorithm to that of the minimum cost assignment, is bounded by $2$ for\nC-Balance. We then extend this approach to $n$ agents by proposing the\nDC-Balance algorithm that makes iterative calls to C-Balance. We show the\nconvergence of DC-Balance, resulting in envy that is arbitrarily close to $2M$.\nWe derive $CoF$ bounds for DC-Balance and provide insights about its dependency\non the instance-specific parameters and the desired degree of envy. We\nexperimentally show that our algorithm runs several orders of magnitude faster\nthan a suitably formulated ILP.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uacf5\uc815\ud55c \uacbd\ub85c \ud560\ub2f9 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\uba70, \uc81c\uc548\ud55c C-Balance \ubc0f DC-Balance \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc73c\ub85c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \ubd88\uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \uc904\uc774\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \uacbd\ub85c \ud560\ub2f9\uc774 \ubd88\uacf5\uc815\ud558\uac8c \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc9c0\ubbc0\ub85c \uc774\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "C-Balance\uc640 DC-Balance \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uacbd\ub85c \ud560\ub2f9\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uba70 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc774 ILP\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uba87 \ubc30 \ub354 \ube60\ub974\uac8c \uc2e4\ud589\ub418\uba70, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \ubd88\uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uc904\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc5d0\uc11c \uacf5\uc815\ud55c \uacbd\ub85c \ud560\ub2f9 \ubb38\uc81c\uc758 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc801 \uc811\uadfc\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubd88\uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \uacbd\uac10\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uacf5\uc815\ud55c \uacbd\ub85c \ud560\ub2f9 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud0d0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub294 \uc778\uc811 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub4e4 \uc0ac\uc774\uc5d0 \ud615\uc131\ub41c \uac00\uc911 \uc774\ubd84 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub85c \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c K\uac1c\uc758 \ubd84\ub9ac\ub41c \uc9d1\ud569(\ub2e8\uacc4)\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ub204\uc5b4\uc9c4 \ub178\ub4dc\ub4e4\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubaa9\ud45c\ub294 \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\uc791\ud558\uc5ec \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \ub05d\ub098\ub294 n\uba85\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0\uac8c \ub178\ub4dc \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \ud560\ub2f9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uacbd\ub85c \ube44\uc6a9\uc758 \ucd1d\ud569\uc744 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud560\ub2f9\uc774 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ubd88\uacf5\uc815\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ube44\uc6a9 \ubd88\uade0\ud615(\uc9c8\ud22c)\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c8\ud22c\ub97c \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ud560\ub2f9\uc744 \ucc3e\ub294 \uac83\uc774 NP-hard\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub450 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0 \uc9c8\ud22c\uac00 2M\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\ud55c\ub418\ub294 C-Balance \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc9c8\ud22c\uac00 2M\uc778 \uc608\uc2dc\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \uc801\uc808\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

While MCP\nenhances the capabilities of LLM-based agents, it also introduces new security\nrisks and expands their attack surfaces. In this paper, we present the first\nsystematic taxonomy of MCP security, identifying 17 attack types across 4\nprimary attack surfaces. We introduce MCPSecBench, a comprehensive security\nbenchmark and playground that integrates prompt datasets, MCP servers, MCP\nclients, and attack scripts to evaluate these attacks across three major MCP\nproviders.

We propose Cognitive Workspace, a novel paradigm that transcends\ntraditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by emulating human cognitive\nmechanisms of external memory use. Drawing from cognitive science foundations\nincluding Baddeley's working memory model, Clark's extended mind thesis, and\nHutchins' distributed cognition framework, we demonstrate that current passive\nretrieval systems fail to capture the dynamic, task-driven nature of human\nmemory management. Our analysis of 2024-2025 developments reveals that while\ntechniques like Infini-attention and StreamingLLM achieve impressive context\nlengths, they lack the metacognitive awareness and active planning capabilities\nessential for true cognitive extension. Cognitive Workspace addresses these\nlimitations through three core innovations: (1) active memory management with\ndeliberate information curation, (2) hierarchical cognitive buffers enabling\npersistent working states, and (3) task-driven context optimization that\ndynamically adapts to cognitive demands. Empirical validation demonstrates\nCognitive Workspace achieves an average 58.6% memory reuse rate (ranging from\n54-60% across different tasks) compared to 0% for traditional RAG, with 17-18%\nnet efficiency gain despite 3.3x higher operation counts. Statistical analysis\nconfirms these advantages with p < 0.001 and Cohen's d > 23 across multiple\ntask types, establishing the first quantitative evidence for active memory\nsuperiority in LLM systems.

To effectively\nmodel intermodal relationships, we introduce a contextual attention mechanism\nwithin the fusion process. Leveraging contextual-attention layers, this\nmechanism effectively captures intermodality interactions, enhancing the\nmodel's comprehension of complex relationships between textual and visual data.\nThe deep neural network architecture of our model learns from these fused\nfeatures, leading to improved accuracy compared to existing baselines.\nExperimental results demonstrate significant advancements in classifying social\nmedia data into informative and noninformative categories across various\nnatural disasters. Our model achieves a notable 2.43% increase in accuracy and\n5.18% in F1-score, highlighting its efficacy in processing complex multimodal\ndata. Beyond quantitative metrics, our approach provides deeper insight into\nthe sentiments expressed during crises. The practical implications extend to\nreal time disaster management, where enhanced sentiment analysis can optimize\nthe accuracy of emergency interventions. By bridging the gap between multimodal\nanalysis, LLM powered text understanding, and disaster response, our work\npresents a promising direction for Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven crisis\nmanagement solutions.

In\nresponse, a multimodal framework, CardAIc-Agents, was proposed to augment\nmodels with external tools and adaptively support diverse cardiac tasks.\nSpecifically, a CardiacRAG agent generated general plans from updatable cardiac\nknowledge, while the chief agent integrated tools to autonomously execute these\nplans and deliver decisions. To enable adaptive and case-specific\ncustomization, a stepwise update strategy was proposed to dynamically refine\nplans based on preceding execution results, once the task was assessed as\ncomplex. In addition, a multidisciplinary discussion tool was introduced to\ninterpret challenging cases, thereby supporting further adaptation. When\nclinicians raised concerns, visual review panels were provided to assist final\nvalidation.

Traditional cyber defense\nstrategies have largely focused on fortification, while some approaches attempt\nto anticipate attacker strategies by mapping them to cognitive vulnerabilities,\nyet they fall short in dynamically interpreting attacks in progress. In\nrecognition of this gap, IARPA's ReSCIND program seeks to infer, defend\nagainst, and even exploit attacker cognitive traits. In this paper, we present\na novel methodology that leverages large language models (LLMs) to extract\nquantifiable insights into the cognitive bias of loss aversion from hacker\nbehavior. Our data are collected from an experiment in which hackers were\nrecruited to attack a controlled demonstration network. We process the hacker\ngenerated notes using LLMs using it to segment the various actions and\ncorrelate the actions to predefined persistence mechanisms used by hackers. By\ncorrelating the implementation of these mechanisms with various operational\ntriggers, our analysis provides new insights into how loss aversion manifests\nin hacker decision-making. The results demonstrate that LLMs can effectively\ndissect and interpret nuanced behavioral patterns, thereby offering a\ntransformative approach to enhancing cyber defense strategies through\nreal-time, behavior-based analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud574\ucee4\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0\uc11c \uc190\uc2e4 \ud68c\ud53c\uc758 \uc778\uc9c0 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744

Although various algorithmic\napproaches-such as genetic programming, reinforcement learning, and large\nlanguage models-have significantly expanded the capacity for alpha discovery,\nsystematic evaluation remains a key challenge. Existing evaluation metrics\npredominantly include backtesting and correlation-based measures. Backtesting\nis computationally intensive, inherently sequential, and sensitive to specific\nstrategy parameters. Correlation-based metrics, though efficient, assess only\npredictive ability and overlook other crucial properties such as temporal\nstability, robustness, diversity, and interpretability. Additionally, the\nclosed-source nature of most existing alpha mining models hinders\nreproducibility and slows progress in this field. To address these issues, we\npropose AlphaEval, a unified, parallelizable, and backtest-free evaluation\nframework for automated alpha mining models. AlphaEval assesses the overall\nquality of generated alphas along five complementary dimensions: predictive\npower, stability, robustness to market perturbations, financial logic, and\ndiversity. Extensive experiments across representative alpha mining algorithms\ndemonstrate that AlphaEval achieves evaluation consistency comparable to\ncomprehensive backtesting, while providing more comprehensive insights and\nhigher efficiency. Furthermore, AlphaEval effectively identifies superior\nalphas compared to traditional single-metric screening approaches.

This enables conditions like, e.g., invariants to be easily\nadded during the modelling phase. In addition, the approach can be considered\nas mesh free and can be utilised to compute solutions on arbitrary grids after\nthe training phase. Therefore, physics-informed neural networks are emerging as\na promising alternative to solving differential equations with methods from\nnumerical mathematics. However, their performance highly depends on a large\nvariety of factors. In this paper, we systematically investigate and evaluate a\ncore component of the approach, namely the training point distribution. We test\ntwo ordinary and two partial differential equations with five strategies for\ntraining data generation and shallow network architectures, with one and two\nhidden layers. In addition to common distributions, we introduce sine-based\ntraining points, which are motivated by the construction of Chebyshev nodes.\nThe results are challenged by using certain parameter combinations like, e.g.,\nrandom and fixed-seed weight initialisation for reproducibility.

Unlike existing\njailbreak attacks, this weakness is distinct in that it does not involve a\nspecific attack objective, such as generating instructions for \\textit{building\na bomb}. Prior attack methods predominantly target localized components of the\nLLM guardrail. In contrast, involuntary jailbreaks may potentially compromise\nthe entire guardrail structure, which our method reveals to be surprisingly\nfragile. We merely employ a single universal prompt to achieve this goal.

These MPC protocols fundamentally rely on\nOblivious Transfer (OT), particularly Correlated OT (COT), to generate\ncorrelated randomness essential for secure computation. Although COT generation\nis efficient in conventional two-party settings with resource-rich\nparticipants, it becomes a critical bottleneck in real-world inference on\nresource-constrained devices (e.g., IoT sensors and wearables), due to both\ncommunication latency and limited computational capacity. To enable real-time\nsecure inference, we introduce Silentflow, a highly efficient Trusted Execution\nEnvironment (TEE)-assisted protocol that eliminates communication in COT\ngeneration. We tackle the core performance bottleneck-low computational\nintensity-through structured algorithmic decomposition: kernel fusion for\nparallelism, Blocked On-chip eXpansion (BOX) to improve memory access patterns,\nand vectorized batch operations to maximize memory bandwidth utilization.\nThrough design space exploration, we balance end-to-end latency and resource\ndemands, achieving up to 39.51x speedup over state-of-the-art protocols.

ITS\narchitectures aim to tolerate intrusions, ensuring system compromise is\nprevented or mitigated even with adversary presence. Existing ITS solutions\noften employ Risk Managers leveraging public security intelligence to adjust\nsystem defenses dynamically against emerging threats. However, these approaches\nrely heavily on databases like NVD and ExploitDB, which require manual analysis\nfor newly discovered vulnerabilities. This dependency limits the system's\nresponsiveness to rapidly evolving threats. HAL 9000, an ITS Risk Manager\nintroduced in our prior work, addressed these challenges through machine\nlearning. By analyzing descriptions of known vulnerabilities, HAL 9000 predicts\nand assesses new vulnerabilities automatically. To calculate the risk of a\nsystem, it also incorporates the Exploitability Probability Scoring system to\nestimate the likelihood of exploitation within 30 days, enhancing proactive\ndefense capabilities.\n  Despite its success, HAL 9000's reliance on NVD and ExploitDB knowledge is a\nlimitation, considering the availability of other sources of information. This\nextended work introduces a custom-built scraper that continuously mines diverse\nthreat sources, including security advisories, research forums, and real-time\nexploit proofs-of-concept.

In the Reason stage (RISE-CoT), a reinforcement\nlearning-driven \"annotation-reasoning-annotation\" closed-loop generates\nvisually grounded, logically consistent CoTs by verifying their ability to\nreconstruct original annotations without direct leakage. The Inspire and\nStrengthen stage (RISE-R1) leverages a high-quality CoT subset, filtered by\nRISE-CoT rewards, for supervised fine-tuning, followed by reinforcement\nfine-tuning to produce interpretable reasoning and accurate annotations,\nachieving Expertise in complex visual tasks. Evaluated on complex and simple\nimage annotation tasks, RISE-trained Qwen2-VL-2B outperforms SFT and\nVisual-RFT, achieving robust performance and enhanced explainability.

We identify an analogous issue, search-time\ncontamination (STC), in evaluating search-based LLM agents which use tools to\ngather information from online sources when answering user queries. STC occurs\nwhen the retrieval step surfaces a source containing the test question (or a\nnear-duplicate) alongside its answer, enabling agents to copy rather than\ngenuinely infer or reason, undermining benchmark integrity. We find that\nHuggingFace, an online platform hosting evaluation datasets, appears among\nretrieved sources in search based agent logs. Consequently, agents often\nexplicitly acknowledge discovering question answer pairs from HuggingFace\nwithin their reasoning chains. On three commonly used capability benchmarks:\nHumanity's Last Exam (HLE), SimpleQA, and GPQA, we demonstrate that for\napproximately 3% of questions, search-based agents directly find the datasets\nwith ground truth labels on HuggingFace. When millions of evaluation queries\ntarget the same benchmark, even small, repeated leaks can accelerate the\nbenchmark's obsolescence, shortening its intended lifecycle. After HuggingFace\nis blocked, we observe a drop in accuracy on the contaminated subset of\napproximately 15%. We further show through ablation experiments that publicly\naccessible evaluation datasets on HuggingFace may not be the sole source of\nSTC. To this end, we conclude by proposing best practices for benchmark design\nand result reporting to address this novel form of leakage and ensure\ntrustworthy evaluation of search-based LLM agents.

This task demands a deep understanding of the system\nbehavior, including the nonlinear factors that influence its dynamics. In this\narticle, we propose a novel methodology for identifying a feedback linearized\nphysical system based on known prior dynamic behavior. Initially, the system is\nidentified using a sparse regression algorithm, subsequently a feedback\ncontroller is designed for the discovered system by applying Lie derivatives to\nthe dictionary of output functions to derive an augmented constraint which\nguarantees that no internal dynamics are observed.

Data augmentation is a key strategy to mitigate this\nissue by enhancing the diversity of training datasets. Signal\nTransformation-based Data Augmentation (STDA) techniques have been widely used\nin HAR. However, these methods are often physically implausible, potentially\nresulting in augmented data that fails to preserve the original meaning of the\nactivity labels. In this study, we introduce and systematically characterize\nPhysically Plausible Data Augmentation (PPDA) enabled by physics simulation.\nPPDA leverages human body movement data from motion capture or video-based pose\nestimation and incorporates various realistic variabilities through physics\nsimulation, including modifying body movements, sensor placements, and\nhardware-related effects. We compare the performance of PPDAs with traditional\nSTDAs on three public datasets of daily activities and fitness workouts. First,\nwe evaluate each augmentation method individually, directly comparing PPDAs to\ntheir STDA counterparts. Next, we assess how combining multiple PPDAs can\nreduce the need for initial data collection by varying the number of subjects\nused for training.

Its core operation, scalar multiplication,\ndenoted as $k \\cdot P$, where $P$ is a base point and $k$ is a private scalar,\nrelies heavily on the secrecy and unpredictability of $k$. Conventionally, $k$\nis selected using user input or pseudorandom number generators. However, in\nresource-constrained environments with weak entropy sources, these approaches\nmay yield low-entropy or biased scalars, increasing susceptibility to\nside-channel and key recovery attacks. To mitigate these vulnerabilities, we\nintroduce an optimization-driven scalar generation method that explicitly\nmaximizes bit-level entropy. Our approach uses differential evolution (DE), a\npopulation-based metaheuristic algorithm, to search for scalars whose binary\nrepresentations exhibit maximal entropy, defined by an even and statistically\nuniform distribution of ones and zeros. This reformulation of scalar selection\nas an entropy-optimization problem enhances resistance to entropy-based\ncryptanalytic techniques and improves overall unpredictability. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that DE-optimized scalars achieve entropy significantly\nhigher than conventionally generated scalars. The proposed method can be\nintegrated into existing ECC-based protocols, offering a deterministic, tunable\nalternative to traditional randomness, ideal for applications in blockchain,\nsecure messaging, IoT, and other resource-constrained environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5d8\ub9ac\ud504\ud2f1 \uace1\uc120 \uc554\ud638\ud654(ECC)\uc758

We study this trade-off in chess by\ncharacterizing and comparing dynamics between human vs human and AI vs AI\ngames. We propose a network-based metric of piece-to-piece interaction to\nquantify the ongoing strategic tension on the board. Its evolution in games\nreveals that the most competitive AI players sustain higher levels of strategic\ntension for longer durations than elite human players. Cumulative tension\nvaries with algorithmic complexity for AI and correspondingly in human-played\ngames increases abruptly with expertise at about 1600 Elo and again at 2300\nElo. The profiles reveal different approaches. Highly competitive AI tolerates\ninterconnected positions balanced between offensive and defensive tactics over\nlong periods. Human play, in contrast, limits tension and game complexity,\nwhich may reflect cognitive limitations and adaptive strategies. The difference\nmay have implications for AI usage in complex, strategic environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uccb4\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \uacb0\uc815-making\uc740 \uc989\uac01\uc801\uc778 \uae30\ud68c\uc640 \uc7a5\uae30\uc801\uc778 \ubaa9\ud45c \uac04\uc758 \uae34\uc7a5\uc744 \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c\ub2e4.

However,\nexisting systems are not designed to achieve human-AI complementarity:\ndecisions made by a human using an algorithmic matching system are not\nnecessarily better than those made by the human or by the algorithm alone. Our\nwork aims to address this gap. To this end, we propose collaborative matching\n(comatch), a data-driven algorithmic matching system that takes a collaborative\napproach: rather than making all the matching decisions for a matching task\nlike existing systems, it selects only the decisions that it is the most\nconfident in, deferring the rest to the human decision maker. In the process,\ncomatch optimizes how many decisions it makes and how many it defers to the\nhuman decision maker to provably maximize performance. We conduct a large-scale\nhuman subject study with $800$ participants to validate the proposed approach.\nThe results demonstrate that the matching outcomes produced by comatch\noutperform those generated by either human participants or by algorithmic\nmatching on their own.

Implicit Memory: Exploring Multi-hop Complex Reasoning Over Personalized Information", "comment": "15 pages, 13 figures, 3 tables", "summary": "In large language model-based agents, memory serves as a critical capability\nfor achieving personalization by storing and utilizing users' information.\nAlthough some previous studies have adopted memory to implement user\npersonalization, they typically focus on preference alignment and simple\nquestion-answering. However, in the real world, complex tasks often require\nmulti-hop reasoning on a large amount of user information, which poses\nsignificant challenges for current memory approaches. To address this\nlimitation, we propose the multi-hop personalized reasoning task to explore how\ndifferent memory mechanisms perform in multi-hop reasoning over personalized\ninformation. We explicitly define this task and construct a dataset along with\na unified evaluation framework. Then, we implement various explicit and\nimplicit memory methods and conduct comprehensive experiments.

When applied to classification, CP produces a prediction\nset of possible labels that is guaranteed to contain the true label with high\nprobability, regardless of the underlying classifier. However, standard CP\ntreats classes as flat and unstructured, ignoring domain knowledge such as\nsemantic relationships or hierarchical structure among class labels. This paper\npresents hierarchical conformal classification (HCC), an extension of CP that\nincorporates class hierarchies into both the structure and semantics of\nprediction sets. We formulate HCC as a constrained optimization problem whose\nsolutions yield prediction sets composed of nodes at different levels of the\nhierarchy, while maintaining coverage guarantees. To address the combinatorial\nnature of the problem, we formally show that a much smaller, well-structured\nsubset of candidate solutions suffices to ensure coverage while upholding\noptimality. An empirical evaluation on three new benchmarks consisting of\naudio, image, and text data highlights the advantages of our approach, and a\nuser study shows that annotators significantly prefer hierarchical over flat\nprediction sets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc900\uac70 \ubd84\ub958(HCC)\ub294 \uc900\uac70 \uc608\uce21(CP)\uc758 \ud655\uc7a5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4 \uacc4\uce35 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc608\uce21 \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 CP\ub294 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4\uc758 \uc138\uba58\ud2f1 \uad00\uacc4\ub098 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uad6c\uc870\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ubb34\uc2dc\ud558\uc5ec \ud074\ub798\uc2a4\ub4e4\uc744 \ud3c9\uba74\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uad6c\uc870\uac00 \uc5c6\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ucde8\uae09\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "HCC\ub97c \uc81c\uc57d \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc815\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uace0 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uacc4\uce35 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ub178\ub4dc\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \uc608\uce21 \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "HCC\ub294 \ucd5c\uc801\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \ucee4\ubc84\ub9ac\uc9c0 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 HCC\uc758 \uc774\uc810\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70, \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc608\uce21 \uc138\ud2b8\uac00 \ud3c9\uba74\uc801 \uc608\uce21 \uc138\ud2b8\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc120\ud638\ub41c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc900\uac70 \uc608\uce21(CP)\uc740 \uc720\ud55c \uc0d8\ud50c \ucee4\ubc84\ub9ac\uc9c0 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc73c\ub85c \uba38\uc2e0 \ub7ec\ub2dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \ubd84\ub958\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ub420 \ub54c \uc9c4\uc9dc \ub808\uc774\ube14\uc744 \ub192\uc740 \ud655\ub960\ub85c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub808\uc774\ube14\uc758 \uc608\uce21 \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ud45c\uc900 CP\ub294 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4\ub4e4\uc744 \ud3c9\uba74\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uad6c\uc870\uac00 \uc5c6\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ucde8\uae09\ud558\uc5ec \ud074\ub798\uc2a4 \ub808\uc774\ube14 \uac04\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8 \uad00\uacc4\ub098 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uad6c\uc870\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ubb34\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4 \uacc4\uce35 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uc608\uce21 \uc9d1\ud569\uc758 \uad6c\uc870\uc640 \uc758\ubbf8 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 CP\uc758 \ud655\uc7a5\uc778 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc900\uac70 \ubd84\ub958(HCC)\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

While various scoring systems exist to support\nthis task, their differing goals, methodologies and outputs often lead to\ninconsistent prioritization decisions. This work provides the first\nlarge-scale, outcome-linked empirical comparison of four publicly available\nvulnerability scoring systems: the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS),\nthe Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability Categorization (SSVC), the Exploit\nPrediction Scoring System (EPSS), and the Exploitability Index. We use a\ndataset of 600 real-world vulnerabilities derived from four months of\nMicrosoft's Patch Tuesday disclosures to investigate the relationships between\nthese scores, evaluate how they support vulnerability management task, how\nthese scores categorize vulnerabilities across triage tiers, and assess their\nability to capture the real-world exploitation risk. Our findings reveal\nsignificant disparities in how scoring systems rank the same vulnerabilities,\nwith implications for organizations relying on these metrics to make\ndata-driven, risk-based decisions.

We consider two scenarios, viz.: (a) when a differentiable\ndistance function to the constraint set is given, and (b) when the constraint\nset is only available via queries to a membership oracle. For case (a), we\npropose a simple adaptation of the FM objective with an additional term that\npenalizes the distance between the constraint set and the generated samples.\nFor case (b), we propose to employ randomization and learn a mean flow that is\nnumerically shown to have a high likelihood of satisfying the constraints. This\napproach deviates significantly from existing works that require simple convex\nconstraints, knowledge of a barrier function, or a reflection mechanism to\nconstrain the probability flow. Furthermore, in the proposed setting we show\nthat a two-stage approach, where both stages approximate the same original flow\nbut with only the second stage probing the constraints via randomization, is\nmore computationally efficient. Through several synthetic cases of constrained\ngeneration, we numerically show that the proposed approaches achieve\nsignificant gains in terms of constraint satisfaction while matching the target\ndistributions.

While\nelectrocardiogram (ECG) signals have shown high discriminability, their\nintrusive sensing requirements and discontinuous acquisition limit\npracticality. Photoplethysmography (PPG), on the other hand, enables\ncontinuous, non-intrusive authentication with seamless integration into\nwrist-worn wearable devices. However, most prior work relies on high-frequency\nPPG (e.g., 75 - 500 Hz) and complex deep models, which incur significant energy\nand computational overhead, impeding deployment in power-constrained real-world\nsystems. In this paper, we present the first real-world implementation and\nevaluation of a continuous authentication system on a smartwatch, We-Be Band,\nusing low-frequency (25 Hz) multi-channel PPG signals. Our method employs a\nBi-LSTM with attention mechanism to extract identity-specific features from\nshort (4 s) windows of 4-channel PPG. Through extensive evaluations on both\npublic datasets (PTTPPG) and our We-Be Dataset (26 subjects), we demonstrate\nstrong classification performance with an average test accuracy of 88.11%,\nmacro F1-score of 0.88, False Acceptance Rate (FAR) of 0.48%, False Rejection\nRate (FRR) of 11.77%, and Equal Error Rate (EER) of 2.76%. Our 25 Hz system\nreduces sensor power consumption by 53% compared to 512 Hz and 19% compared to\n128 Hz setups without compromising performance. We find that sampling at 25 Hz\npreserves authentication accuracy, whereas performance drops sharply at 20 Hz\nwhile offering only trivial additional power savings, underscoring 25 Hz as the\npractical lower bound.

While FL enhances data privacy by design, it remains\nvulnerable to various security and privacy threats. This survey provides a\ncomprehensive overview of more than 200 papers regarding the state-of-the-art\nattacks and defense mechanisms developed to address these challenges,\ncategorizing them into security-enhancing and privacy-preserving techniques.\nSecurity-enhancing methods aim to improve FL robustness against malicious\nbehaviors such as byzantine attacks, poisoning, and Sybil attacks. At the same\ntime, privacy-preserving techniques focus on protecting sensitive data through\ncryptographic approaches, differential privacy, and secure aggregation.

Although current functional MRI\nclassification approaches tend to be based on static functional connectivity or\ncannot capture spatio-temporal relationships comprehensively, we present a new\nframework that leverages dynamic graph creation and spatiotemporal attention\nmechanisms for Autism Spectrum Disorder(ASD) diagnosis. The approach used in\nthis research dynamically infers functional brain connectivity in each time\ninterval using transformer-based attention mechanisms, enabling the model to\nselectively focus on crucial brain regions and time segments. By constructing\ntime-varying graphs that are then processed with Graph Convolutional Networks\n(GCNs) and transformers, our method successfully captures both localized\ninteractions and global temporal dependencies. Evaluated on the subset of ABIDE\ndataset, our model achieves 63.2 accuracy and 60.0 AUC, outperforming static\ngraph-based approaches (e.g., GCN:51.8). This validates the efficacy of joint\nmodeling of dynamic connectivity and spatio-temporal context for fMRI\nclassification. The core novelty arises from (1) attention-driven dynamic graph\ncreation that learns temporal brain region interactions and (2) hierarchical\nspatio-temporal feature fusion through GCNtransformer fusion.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc790\ud3d0 \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc \uc7a5\uc560(ASD) \uc9c4\ub2e8\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc5ed\ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubc0f \uc2dc\uacf5\uac04 \uc8fc\uc758 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2e0\uacbd \uacfc\ud559 \ubd84\uc57c\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc2e0\uacbd \ud65c\ub3d9 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30 \uae30\ubc18 \uc8fc\uc758 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac01 \uc2dc\uac04 \uac04\uaca9\uc758 \uae30\ub2a5\uc801 \ub1cc \uc5f0\uacb0\uc131\uc744 \uc5ed\ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\ub860\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub1cc \uc601\uc5ed\uacfc \uc2dc\uac04 \uad6c\uac04\uc5d0 \uc120\ud0dd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc9d1\uc911\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "ABIDE \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc758 \ud558\uc704 \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 63.2%\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc640 60.0 AUC\ub97c \uae30\ub85d\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\uc801 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uae30\ubc18 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd(\uc608: GCN: 51.8)\uc744 \ub2a5\uac00\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub3d9\uc801 \uc5f0\uacb0\uc131\uacfc \uc2dc\uacf5\uac04 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc758 \uacf5\ub3d9 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc774 fMRI \ubd84\ub958\uc5d0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc784\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc2e0\uacbd \ud65c\ub3d9 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc2e0\uacbd \uacfc\ud559 \ubd84\uc57c \ubc1c\uc804\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uae30\ub2a5\uc801 MRI \ubd84\ub958 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc815\uc801 \uae30\ub2a5\uc801 \uc5f0\uacb0\uc131\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc2dc\uacf5\uac04 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc790\ud3d0 \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc \uc7a5\uc560(ASD) \uc9c4\ub2e8\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ub3d9\uc801 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubc0f \uc2dc\uacf5\uac04 \uc8fc\uc758 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub41c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30 \uae30\ubc18 \uc8fc\uc758 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac01 \uc2dc\uac04 \uac04\uaca9\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\ub2a5\uc801 \ub1cc \uc5f0\uacb0\uc131\uc744 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\ub860\ud558\uba70, \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub1cc \uc601\uc5ed\uacfc \uc2dc\uac04 \uad6c\uac04\uc5d0 \uc120\ud0dd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc9d1\uc911\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ubcc0\ud558\ub294 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ucee8\ubcfc\ub8e8\uc158 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c(GCN)\uc640 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uad6d\uc18c\uc801\uc778 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uacfc \uc804\uc5ed\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc885\uc18d\uc131\uc744 \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

The Node.js ecosystem has been subject to a wide array of\nattacks, likely due to its size and prevalence. To counter such attacks, the\nresearch community and practitioners have proposed a range of static and\ndynamic mechanisms, including process- and language-level sandboxing,\npermission systems, and taint tracking. Drawing on valuable insight from these\nworks, this paper studies a runtime protection mechanism for (the supply chain\nof) Node.js applications with the ambitious goals of compatibility, automation,\nminimal overhead, and policy conciseness.\n  Specifically, we design, implement and evaluate NodeShield, a protection\nmechanism for Node.js that enforces an application's dependency hierarchy and\ncontrols access to system resources at runtime. We leverage the up-and-coming\nSBOM standard as the source of truth for the dependency hierarchy of the\napplication, thus preventing components from stealthily abusing undeclared\ncomponents. We propose to enhance the SBOM with a notion of capabilities that\nrepresents a set of related system resources a component may access. Our\nproposed SBOM extension, the Capability Bill of Materials or CBOM, records the\nrequired capabilities of each component, providing valuable insight into the\npotential privileged behavior. NodeShield enforces the SBOM and CBOM at runtime\nvia code outlining (as opposed to inlining) with no modifications to the\noriginal code or Node.js runtime, thus preventing unexpected, potentially\nmalicious behavior. Our evaluation shows that NodeShield can prevent over 98%\nout of 67 known supply chain attacks while incurring minimal overhead on\nservers at less than 1ms per request. We achieve this while maintaining broad\ncompatibility with vanilla Node.js and a concise policy language that consists\nof at most 7 entries per dependency.", "AI": {"tldr": "NodeShield\ub294 Node.js

However, its effectiveness is\nhindered by the use of static operators and the lack of knowledge accumulation\nmechanisms. We introduce HiFo-Prompt, a framework that guides LLMs with two\nsynergistic prompting strategies: Foresight and Hindsight. Foresight-based\nprompts adaptively steer the search based on population dynamics, managing the\nexploration-exploitation trade-off. In addition, hindsight-based prompts mimic\nhuman expertise by distilling successful heuristics from past generations into\nfundamental, reusable design principles. This dual mechanism transforms\ntransient discoveries into a persistent knowledge base, enabling the LLM to\nlearn from its own experience. Empirical results demonstrate that HiFo-Prompt\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based AHD methods, generating\nhigher-quality heuristics while achieving substantially faster convergence and\nsuperior query efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc790\ub3d9 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1 \uc124\uacc4(AHD)\uac00 \uc9c4\ud654 \uacc4\uc0b0(EC) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc600\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc815\uc801 \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc790 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uacfc \uc9c0\uc2dd \ucd95\uc801 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998 \ubd80\uc871\uc73c\ub85c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc774 \uc800\ud574\ubc1b\uc558\ub2e4.

To be published in SC 2025", "summary": "Emerging expert-specialized Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures, such as\nDeepSeek-MoE, deliver strong model quality through fine-grained expert\nsegmentation and large top-k routing. However, their scalability is limited by\nsubstantial activation memory overhead and costly all-to-all communication.\nFurthermore, current MoE training systems - primarily optimized for NVIDIA GPUs\n- perform suboptimally on non-NVIDIA platforms, leaving significant\ncomputational potential untapped. In this work, we present X-MoE, a novel MoE\ntraining system designed to deliver scalable training performance for\nnext-generation MoE architectures. X-MoE achieves this via several novel\ntechniques, including efficient padding-free MoE training with cross-platform\nkernels, redundancy-bypassing dispatch, and hybrid parallelism with\nsequence-sharded MoE blocks. Our evaluation on the Frontier supercomputer,\npowered by AMD MI250X GPUs, shows that X-MoE scales DeepSeek-style MoEs up to\n545 billion parameters across 1024 GPUs - 10x larger than the largest trainable\nmodel with existing methods under the same hardware budget, while maintaining\nhigh training throughput.

Current\nstate-of-the-art neural planning approaches struggle with complex domains,\nproducing plans with missing preconditions, inconsistent goals, and\nhallucinations. While classical planners provide logical guarantees, they lack\nthe flexibility and natural language understanding capabilities needed for\nmodern autonomous systems. Existing neuro-symbolic approaches use one-shot\ntranslation from natural language to formal plans, missing the opportunity for\nneural and symbolic components to work and refine solutions together. To\naddress this gap, we develop LOOP -- a novel neuro-symbolic planning framework\nthat treats planning as an iterative conversation between neural and symbolic\ncomponents rather than simple translation. LOOP integrates 13 coordinated\nneural features including graph neural networks for spatial relationships,\nmulti-agent validation for consensus-based correctness, hierarchical\ndecomposition for complex task management, and causal memory that learns from\nboth successes and failures. Unlike existing approaches, LOOP generates PDDL\nspecifications, refines them iteratively based on symbolic feedback, and builds\na causal knowledge base from execution traces. LOOP was evaluated on six\nstandard IPC benchmark domains, where it achieved 85.8% success rate compared\nto LLM+P (55.0%), LLM-as-Planner (19.2%), and Tree-of-Thoughts (3.3%). This\nwork shows that the key to reliable planning is not in choosing between neural\nnetworks or symbolic reasoners but it lies in making them actually ``talk'' to\neach other during the entire process.

As a result,\nmodality-specific representations often remain isolated, limiting cross-modal\ngeneralisation. In this work, we introduce Shared Prompt AligNER (SPANER), a\nmodality-agnostic PEFT framework designed to embed inputs from diverse\nmodalities into a unified semantic space. At its core, SPANER employs a shared\nprompt mechanism that acts as a conceptual anchor, enabling semantically\nrelated instances to converge spatially regardless of modality. This shared\nprompt design is inherently extensible, supporting the seamless integration of\nadditional modalities, such as audio, without altering the core architecture.\nThrough comprehensive experiments across vision-language and audio-visual\nbenchmarks, SPANER demonstrates competitive few-shot retrieval performance\nwhile preserving high semantic coherence in the learned embedding space.

Within this continuous learning process, we\nhighlight that larger batch sizes result in a 104.3% increase in schema\nrecommendations that are actionable and utilized, resulting in a 9.8% increase\nin extracted holdings - highlighting the importance of a continuous learning\nprocess. To train TASER, we have manually labeled 22,584 pages (28,150,449\ntokens), 3,213 tables for $731,685,511,687 of holdings culminating in one of\nthe first real financial table datasets. We release our dataset TASERTab to\nenable the research community to access real-world financial tables and\noutputs. Our results highlight the promise of agentic, schema-guided extraction\nsystems for robust understanding of real-world financial tables.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ube44\uc815\ud615 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud398\uc774\uc9c0 \uae08\uc735 \ud14c\uc774\ube14\uc744 \uc815\uaddc\ud654\ub418\uace0 \uc2a4\ud0a4\ub9c8\uc5d0 \ub9de\ub294 \ucd9c\ub825\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub294 TASER\ub77c\ub294 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud14c\uc774\ube14 \ucd94\ucd9c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2e4\uc81c \uae08\uc735 \ubb38\uc11c\ub294 \uc218\ubc31\ub9cc \uac1c\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uae08\uc735 \uc0c1\ud488 \uc720\ud615\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\ub098, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4\ub294 \uc885\uc885 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud45c\uc5d0 \uc228\uaca8\uc838 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "TASER\ub294 \ucd08\uae30 \uc2a4\ud0a4\ub9c8\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud14c\uc774\ube14 \ud0d0\uc9c0, \ubd84\ub958, \ucd94\ucd9c \ubc0f \uad8c\uc7a5 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ud14c\uc774\ube14 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc791\ub3d9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "TASER\ub294 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud14c\uc774\ube14 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc778 Table Transformer\ubcf4\ub2e4 10.1% \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc6b0\uc218\ud558\uba70, \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ud070 \ubc30\uce58 \ud06c\uae30\uac00 \uc2a4\ud0a4\ub9c8 \ucd94\ucc9c\uc744 104.3% \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ucf30\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "TASER\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \uae08\uc735 \ud14c\uc774\ube14\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc774\ud574\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1\ud558\uace0 \uc2a4\ud0a4\ub9c8 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ucd94\ucd9c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud604\uc2e4\uc138\uacc4 \uae08\uc735 \ubb38\uc11c\ub294 \uc218\ubc31\ub9cc \uac1c\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uae08\uc735 \uc0c1\ud488 \uc720\ud615\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ubcf4\uace0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc138\ubd80 \uc815\ubcf4\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud558\uace0 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud398\uc774\uc9c0\ub85c \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc9c4 \uc870\uac01\ub09c \ud14c\uc774\ube14\uc5d0 \uc228\uaca8\uc838 \uc788\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc608\ub97c \ub4e4\uc5b4, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \ud14c\uc774\ube14\uc758 99.4%\ub294 \uacbd\uacc4 \uc0c1\uc790\uac00 \uc5c6\uc73c\uba70 \ucd5c\ub300 \ud589 \uc218\ub294 44 \ud398\uc774\uc9c0\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \ud14c\uc774\ube14\ub2f9 426\uac1c\uc5d0 \ub2ec\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc2e4\uc81c \ud14c\uc774\ube14\uc758 \uace0\uc720\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ube44\uc815\ud615 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud398\uc774\uc9c0 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801 \ud14c\uc774\ube14\uc744 \uc815\uaddc\ud654\ub418\uace0 \uc2a4\ud0a4\ub9c8\uc5d0 \ub9de\ub294 \ucd9c\ub825\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\ub294 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \ud14c\uc774\ube14 \ucd94\ucd9c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc778 TASER(Table Agents for Schema-guided Extraction and Recommendation)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud14c\uc774\ube14 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ucd08\uae30 \uc2a4\ud0a4\ub9c8\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud14c\uc774\ube14 \ud0d0\uc9c0, \ubd84\ub958, \ucd94\ucd9c \ubc0f \uad8c\uc7a5 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7f0 \ub2e4\uc74c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ucd94\ucc9c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ucd9c\ub825\ubb3c\uc744 \uac80\ud1a0\ud558\uace0 \uc2a4\ud0a4\ub9c8 \uc218\uc815\uc744 \uad8c\uc7a5\ud558\uba70 \ucd5c\uc885 \ucd94\ucc9c\uc744 \uacb0\uc815\ud558\uc5ec TASER\uac00 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud14c\uc774\ube14 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc778 Table Transformer\ubcf4\ub2e4 10.1% \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c, \ub354 \ud070 \ubc30\uce58 \ud06c\uae30\uac00 \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc2a4\ud0a4\ub9c8 \ucd94\ucc9c\uc744 104.3% \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0, \ucd94\ucd9c\ub41c \ubcf4\uc720\uc790\uc0b0\uc758 9.8% \uc99d\uac00\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

While\nmost existing frameworks focus on single-task, single-model scenarios, many\nreal-world applications (e.g., autonomous driving and augmented reality)\nrequire concurrent execution of diverse tasks including detection,\nsegmentation, and depth estimation. In this work, we propose a unified\nframework to jointly decide which multi-task models to deploy (onload) at\nclients and edge servers, and how to route queries across the hierarchy\n(offload) to maximize overall inference accuracy under memory, compute, and\ncommunication constraints. We formulate this as a mixed-integer program and\nintroduce J3O (Joint Optimization of Onloading and Offloading), an alternating\nalgorithm that (i) greedily selects models to onload via Lagrangian-relaxed\nsubmodular optimization and (ii) determines optimal offloading via constrained\nlinear programming. We further extend J3O to account for batching at the edge,\nmaintaining scalability under heterogeneous task loads. Experiments show J3O\nconsistently achieves over $97\\%$ of the optimal accuracy while incurring less\nthan $15\\%$ of the runtime required by the optimal solver across multi-task\nbenchmarks.", "AI":

Key findings demonstrate that\nthe LOF-based approach (N neighbors=20, contamination=0.2) effectively detects\noutliers, with index matching (weighted by channel proximity) outperforming\nexact matching in SOZ localization.

This context-free mathematical\nformulation is applicable to a wide range of use cases that have worst-case\nperformance requirements. After defining the DMMV problem mathematically, we\nexplore its properties to establish a foundational understanding. To tackle\nDMMV instance sizes of practical relevance, we develop a GPU-accelerated\nheuristic that takes advantage of the mathematical properties of DMMV for\nspeeding up the solution process. We demonstrate the versatile applicability of\nour heuristic by solving three optimization problems as use cases: (1)\npost-training quantization of language models, (2) discrete tomography, and (3)\nFinite Impulse Response (FIR) filter design. In quantization without outlier\nseparation, our heuristic achieves 14% improvement on average over existing\nmethods. In discrete tomography, it reduces reconstruction error by 16% under\nuniform noise and accelerates computations by a factor of 6 on GPU. For FIR\nfilter design, it nearly achieves 50% ripple reduction compared to using the\ncommercial integer optimization solver, Gurobi.

In this work, we identify a significant gap\nbetween LM agents' risk awareness and safety execution abilities: while they\noften answer \"Yes\" to queries like \"Is executing `sudo rm -rf /*' dangerous?\",\nthey will likely fail to identify such risks in instantiated trajectories or\neven directly perform these risky actions when acting as agents.

Our evaluation reveals two critical\nperformance gaps that resemble the generator-validator gaps observed in LMs:\nwhile agents demonstrate near-perfect risk knowledge ($>98\\%$ pass rates), they\nfail to apply this knowledge when identifying risks in actual scenarios (with\nperformance dropping by $>23\\%$) and often still execute risky actions ($<26\\%$\npass rates). Notably, this trend persists across more capable LMs as well as in\nspecialized reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1, indicating that simply scaling\nmodel capabilities or inference compute does not inherently resolve safety\nconcerns.

While classical contextual bandits assume either\nfully centralized data or entirely isolated learners, much remains unexplored\nin networked environments when information is partially shared. In this paper,\nwe address this gap by developing two network-aware Upper Confidence Bound\n(UCB) algorithms, NetLinUCB and Net-SGD-UCB, which enable adaptive information\nsharing guided by dynamically updated network weights. Our approach decompose\nlearning into global and local components and as a result allow agents to\nbenefit from shared structure without full synchronization. Both algorithms\nincur lighter communication costs compared to a fully centralized setting as\nagents only share computed summaries regarding the homogeneous features. We\nestablish regret bounds showing that our methods reduce the learning complexity\nassociated with the shared structure from $O(N)$ to sublinear $O(\\sqrt{N})$,\nwhere $N$ is the size of the network. The two algorithms reveal complementary\nstrengths: NetLinUCB excels in low-noise regimes with fine-grained\nheterogeneity, while Net-SGD-UCB is robust to high-dimensional, high-variance\ncontexts. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods across\nsimulated pricing environments compared to standard benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c

Aligning outputs to user-specific\npreferences in such multi-objective settings typically requires fine-tuning\nmodels for each objective or preference configuration, which is computationally\nexpensive and inflexible. We introduce MAVIS -- Multi-Objective Alignment via\nValue-Guided Inference-Time Search -- a lightweight inference-time alignment\nframework that enables dynamic control over LLM behavior without modifying the\nbase model's weights. MAVIS trains a set of small value models, each\ncorresponding to a distinct objective. At inference time, these value models\nare combined using user-specified weights to produce a tilting function that\nadjusts the base model's output distribution toward desired trade-offs.

While LLMs excel at medical text understanding, they underperform\non EHR-based prediction tasks due to challenges in modeling temporally\nstructured, high-dimensional data. Existing approaches often rely on hybrid\nparadigms, where LLMs serve merely as frozen prior retrievers while downstream\ndeep learning (DL) models handle prediction, failing to improve the LLM's\nintrinsic reasoning capacity and inheriting the generalization limitations of\nDL models. To this end, we propose EAG-RL, a novel two-stage training framework\ndesigned to intrinsically enhance LLMs' EHR reasoning ability through expert\nattention guidance, where expert EHR models refer to task-specific DL models\ntrained on EHR data. Concretely, EAG-RL first constructs high-quality, stepwise\nreasoning trajectories using expert-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search to\neffectively initialize the LLM's policy. Then, EAG-RL further optimizes the\npolicy via reinforcement learning by aligning the LLM's attention with\nclinically salient features identified by expert EHR models. Extensive\nexperiments on two real-world EHR datasets show that EAG-RL improves the\nintrinsic EHR reasoning ability of LLMs by an average of 14.62%, while also\nenhancing robustness to feature perturbations and generalization to unseen\nclinical domains. These results demonstrate the practical potential of EAG-RL\nfor real-world deployment in clinical prediction tasks.

However, incorporating natural\nlanguage-based external events to improve non-stationary forecasting remains\nlargely unexplored, as most approaches still rely on a single modality,\nresulting in limited contextual knowledge and model underperformance. Enabling\nfine-grained multimodal interactions between temporal and textual data is\nchallenged by three fundamental issues: (1) the difficulty of fine-grained\nsynchronization between time-varying discrete textual events and continuous\ntime series; (2) the inherent temporal uncertainty introduced by textual\nsemantics; and (3) the misalignment between textual event embeddings and\nmulti-resolution temporal patterns. In this work, we address these challenges\nby introducing event-aware non-stationary time series forecasting (EventTSF),\nan autoregressive generation framework that integrates historical time series\nwith textual events to make subsequent forecasts. Specifically, EventTSF uses\nautoregressive diffusion with flow matching at each step to capture nuanced\ntemporal-event interactions. To handle event-induced uncertainty, flow matching\ntimesteps are adaptively controlled according to event semantic signals. The\nunderlying denoiser employs a multimodal U-shaped diffusion transformer that\nefficiently fuses temporal and textual modalities across different resolutions.\nExtensive experiments on 8 synthetic and real-world datasets show that EventTSF\noutperforms 12 baselines across diverse event-aware non-stationary time series\nforecasting scenarios, achieving substantial improvements of 10.7% higher\nforecasting accuracy and $1.13\\times$ faster training efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "Event-aware non-stationary time series forecasting (EventTSF)\ub294 \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4\uacfc \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc678\ubd80 \uc0ac\uac74\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uc5f0\uad6c\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "EventTSF\ub294 \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4\uacfc \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ud6c4\uc18d \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \uc790\uae30 \ud68c\uadc0 \uc0dd\uc131 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uac04\uc758 \uc138\ubc00\ud55c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "EventTSF\ub294 12\uac1c\uc758 \uae30\uc900 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uac00 10.7% \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\uace0 \uad50\uc721 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc774 $1.13\\times$ \uc99d\uac00\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "EventTSF\ub294 \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8 \uc720\ubc1c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\uace0 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc608\uce21 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc608\uce21\uc740 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \ubc0f \uc6b4\uc1a1\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud558\uba70, \ube44\uc815\uc0c1 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc740 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ub2e4\ub978 \uc591\uc2dd\uc758 \uc0ac\uac74\uacfc \uae4a\uc774 \uc5bd\ud600 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uae30\ubc18 \uc678\ubd80 \uc0ac\uac74\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc591\uc2dd\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ud0d0\uad6c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\ub2e4. \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ubcc0\ud558\ub294 \ubd88\uc5f0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8\uc640 \uc5f0\uc18d \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uac04\uc758 \uc138\ubc00\ud55c \ub3d9\uae30\ud654, \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc758\ubbf8\uac00 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\ub294 \uace0\uc720\uc758 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131, \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uacfc \ub2e4\uc911 \ud574\uc0c1\ub3c4 \uc2dc\uac04 \ud328\ud134 \uac04\uc758 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58 \ub4f1 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uc774\uc288\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \ubc0f \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uac04\uc758 \uc138\ubc00\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc774 \ub3c4\uc804\ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4\uacfc \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ud6c4\uc18d \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8 \uc778\uc2dd \ube44\uc815\uc0c1 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc608\uce21(EventTSF)\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud55c\ub2e4.

Chart-to-code generation exemplifies this\nchallenge, demanding complex reasoning over visual charts to generate\nstructured code. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) alone is often insufficient,\nhighlighting the need for effective RL strategies that appropriately reward\nstructured outputs. We systematically investigate the performance plateau in\nSFT through large-scale experiments and propose Multimodal Structured\nReinforcement Learning (MSRL) for chart-to-code generation, which substantially\nbreaks through this plateau. We construct the largest training corpus to date,\ncontaining 3 million chart-code pairs from real-world arXiv tables to mitigate\nsimplistic patterns of prior synthetic data. Despite reaching state-of-the-art\nperformance, our experiments show that scaling SFT data eventually hits a\nplateau where further increases yield negligible improvements. Our MSRL method\nleverages a multi-granularity structured reward system using multimodal textual\nand visual feedback. At the textual level, rule-based rewards validate\nfine-grained code details. At the visual level, model-based rewards assess\nstructural similarity by rendering generated code into images and employing an\nevaluator model. We implement this within a two-stage curriculum for training\nstability. Results demonstrate that MSRL significantly breaks the SFT plateau,\nimproving high-level metrics by 6.2% and 9.9% on ChartMimic and ReachQA\nbenchmarks respectively, achieving competitive performance with advanced\nclosed-source models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ucc28\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911\ubaa8\ub2ec

However, existing directed graph neural networks often\nstruggle to jointly capture directional semantics and global structural\npatterns due to their isotropic aggregation mechanisms and localized filtering\nmechanisms. To address this limitation, this paper proposes SVDformer, a novel\nframework that synergizes SVD and Transformer architecture for direction-aware\ngraph representation learning. SVDformer first refines singular value\nembeddings through multi-head self-attention, adaptively enhancing critical\nspectral components while suppressing high-frequency noise. This enables\nlearnable low-pass/high-pass graph filtering without requiring spectral\nkernels. Furthermore, by treating singular vectors as directional projection\nbases and singular values as scaling factors, SVDformer uses the Transformer to\nmodel multi-scale interactions between incoming/outgoing edge patterns through\nattention weights, thereby explicitly preserving edge directionality during\nfeature propagation. Extensive experiments on six directed graph benchmarks\ndemonstrate that SVDformer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs and\ndirection-aware baselines on node classification tasks, establishing a new\nparadigm for learning representations on directed graphs.", "AI": {"tldr": "SVDformer\ub294 \ubc29\ud5a5 \uc778\uc2dd \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, SVD\uc640 Transformer \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ubc29\ud5a5\uc131 \uc758\ubbf8\uc640 \uc804\uc5ed \uad6c\uc870 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucea1\ucc98\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubc29\ud5a5 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc774 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc801\uc778 \uc758\ubbf8\uc640 \uc804\uc5ed \uad6c\uc870 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ud568\uaed8 \ucea1\ucc98\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "SVDformer\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud5e4\ub4dc \uc790\uae30 \uc8fc\uc758\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud2b9\uc774\uac12 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc744 \uc815\uc81c\ud558\uace0, Transformer\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub4e4\uc5b4\uc624\ub294/\ub098\uac00\ub294 \uc5e3\uc9c0 \ud328\ud134 \uac04\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc5ec\uc12f \uac1c\uc758 \ubc29\ud5a5 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\ud5d8\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, SVDformer\ub294 \ucd5c\uc2e0 GNN \ubc0f \ubc29\ud5a5 \uc778\uc2dd \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc744 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd08\uc6d4\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "SVDformer\ub294 \ubc29\ud5a5 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc5d0\uc11c \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \ud655\ub9bd\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubc29\ud5a5 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \ube44\ub300\uce6d \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub41c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubc29\ud5a5 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc740 \ub4f1\ubc29\uc131 \uc9d1\uacc4 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uacfc \uad6d\uc18c \ud544\ud130\ub9c1 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998 \ub54c\ubb38 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc131 \uc758\ubbf8\uc640 \uc804\uc5ed \uad6c\uc870 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ud568\uaed8 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\ub294\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubc29\ud5a5 \uc778\uc2dd \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c SVDformer\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

Traditional methods rely on bounding box or center-point regression,\nneglecting spatial interaction uncertainty and visual-semantic hierarchies.\nRecent methods incorporate attention mechanisms but still face two key issues:\n(1) ignoring processing background regions causes attention drift from the\ndesired area, and (2) uniform labeling fails to distinguish between center and\nedges of the target UI element, leading to click imprecision. Inspired by how\nhumans visually process and interact with GUI elements, we propose the\nValley-to-Peak (V2P) method to address these issues. To mitigate background\ndistractions, V2P introduces a suppression attention mechanism that minimizes\nthe model's focus on irrelevant regions to highlight the intended region. For\nthe issue of center-edge distinction, V2P applies a Fitts' Law-inspired\napproach by modeling GUI interactions as 2D Gaussian heatmaps where the weight\ngradually decreases from the center towards the edges. The weight distribution\nfollows a Gaussian function, with the variance determined by the target's size.\nConsequently, V2P effectively isolates the target area and teaches the model to\nconcentrate on the most essential point of the UI element. The model trained by\nV2P achieves the performance with 92.3% and 50.5% on two benchmarks\nScreenSpot-v2 and ScreenSpot-Pro.

However, the high computational cost associated with\ntraditional search and optimization strategies, such as Random Search, Particle\nSwarm Optimization and Bayesian Optimization, remains a significant challenge.\nMoreover, AutoML systems typically explore a large search space, which can lead\nto overfitting. This paper introduces a metalearning method for dynamically\ndesigning search spaces for AutoML system. The proposed method uses historical\nmetaknowledge to select promising regions of the search space, accelerating the\noptimization process. According to experiments conducted for this study, the\nproposed method can reduce runtime by 89\\% in Random Search and search space by\n(1.8/13 preprocessor and 4.3/16 classifier), without compromising significant\npredictive performance. Moreover, the proposed method showed competitive\nperformance when adapted to Auto-Sklearn, reducing its search space.\nFurthermore, this study encompasses insights into meta-feature selection,\nmeta-model explainability, and the trade-offs inherent in search space\nreduction strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uba38\uc2e0\ub7ec\ub2dd(AutoML)\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378

However, LIME's inherent\nrandomness in perturbation and sampling can lead to locality and instability\nissues, especially in scenarios with limited training data. In such cases, data\nscarcity can result in the generation of unrealistic variations and samples\nthat deviate from the true data manifold. Consequently, the surrogate model may\nfail to accurately approximate the complex decision boundary of the original\nmodel. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Instance-based Transfer\nLearning LIME framework (ITL-LIME) that enhances explanation fidelity and\nstability in data-constrained environments. ITL-LIME introduces instance\ntransfer learning into the LIME framework by leveraging relevant real instances\nfrom a related source domain to aid the explanation process in the target\ndomain. Specifically, we employ clustering to partition the source domain into\nclusters with representative prototypes. Instead of generating random\nperturbations, our method retrieves pertinent real source instances from the\nsource cluster whose prototype is most similar to the target instance. These\nare then combined with the target instance's neighboring real instances. To\ndefine a compact locality, we further construct a contrastive learning-based\nencoder as a weighting mechanism to assign weights to the instances from the\ncombined set based on their proximity to the target instance.

In order to address these issues, we propose a classifier\ncalled HCAL based on MTL integrated with prototype contrastive learning and\nadaptive task-weighting mechanisms. The most significant advantage of our\nclassifier is semantic consistency including both prototype with explicitly\nmodeling label and feature aggregation from child classes to parent classes.\nThe other important advantage is an adaptive loss-weighting mechanism that\ndynamically allocates optimization resources by monitoring task-specific\nconvergence rates. It effectively resolves the \"one-strong-many-weak\"\noptimization bias inherent in traditional MTL approaches.

Three classification tasks were\nformulated on the 2D t-SNE embeddings: (1) distinguishing clinical success from\nfailure/no-resection, (2) separating high-difficulty from low-difficulty cases,\nand (3) identifying optimal cases, defined as successful outcomes with minimal\nclinical difficulty. Four classifiers, namely, Random Forests, Support Vector\nMachines, Logistic Regression, and k-Nearest Neighbors, were trained and\nevaluated using stratified 5-fold cross-validation. Across tasks, the Random\nForest and k-NN classifiers demonstrated superior performance, achieving up to\n88.8% accuracy in optimal case detection (successful outcomes with minimal\nclinical difficulty). Additionally, feature influence sensitivity maps were\ngenerated using SHAP explanations applied to model predicting t-SNE\ncoordinates, revealing spatially localized feature importance within the\nembedding space.

This paper introduces DyMixOp, a novel neural operator framework\nfor PDEs that integrates insights from complex dynamical systems to address\nthis challenge. Grounded in inertial manifold theory, DyMixOp transforms\ninfinite-dimensional nonlinear PDE dynamics into a finite-dimensional latent\nspace, establishing a structured foundation that maintains essential nonlinear\ninteractions and enhances physical interpretability. A key innovation is the\nLocal-Global-Mixing (LGM) transformation, inspired by convection dynamics in\nturbulence. This transformation effectively captures both fine-scale details\nand nonlinear interactions, while mitigating spectral bias commonly found in\nexisting neural operators.

However, effectively\nquantifying and visualizing the inherent uncertainty in predictions remains\nchallenging. Without an understanding of the uncertainty, the reliability of NN\nmodels in applications where trustworthiness is paramount is significantly\ncompromised. This paper introduces the uncertainty tube, a novel,\ncomputationally efficient visualization method designed to represent this\nuncertainty in NN-derived particle paths. Our key innovation is the design and\nimplementation of a superelliptical tube that accurately captures and\nintuitively conveys nonsymmetric uncertainty. By integrating well-established\nuncertainty quantification techniques, such as Deep Ensembles, Monte Carlo\nDropout (MC Dropout), and Stochastic Weight Averaging-Gaussian (SWAG), we\ndemonstrate the practical utility of the uncertainty tube, showcasing its\napplication on both synthetic and simulation datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \uc785\uc790 \uada4\uc801 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc2dc\uac01\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ud29c\ube0c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(NN) \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc608\uce21 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uc2dc\uac01\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud558\uba70, \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc751\uc6a9 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c NN \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\uc74c.", "method": "\uc288\ud37c\ud0c0\uc6d0\ud615 \ud29c\ube0c\ub97c \uc124\uacc4 \ubc0f \uad6c\ud604\ud558\uc5ec \ube44\ub300\uce6d\uc801 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uace0 \uc9c1\uad00\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\ub2ec\ud558\uba70, Deep Ensembles, Monte Carlo Dropout \ubc0f Stochastic Weight Averaging-Gaussian\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc774\ubbf8 \ud655\ub9bd\ub41c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654 \uae30\uc220\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569.", "result": "\ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ud29c\ube0c\uc758 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uace0 \ud569\uc131 \ubc0f \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc801\uc6a9 \uc0ac\ub840\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90c.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 NN\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\ub3c4\ub41c \uc785\uc790 \uacbd\ub85c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2dc\uac01\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uacfc\ud559 \ubc0f \uacf5\ud559 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\ub294 \ub370 \uae30\uc5ec\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c.", "translated_summary": "\uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(NN)\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \uc785\uc790 \uada4\uc801 \uc608\uce21\uc740 \ub9ce\uc740 \uacfc\ud559 \ubc0f \uacf5\ud559 \ubd84\uc57c\ub97c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf30\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0\uc11c \ub0b4\uc7ac\ub41c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uc2dc\uac01\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uba74 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc751\uc6a9 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c NN \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc774 \ud06c\uac8c \uc190\uc0c1\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 NN\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\ub3c4\ub41c \uc785\uc790 \uacbd\ub85c\uc758 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\uac01\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ud29c\ube0c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \ud601\uc2e0\uc740 \ube44\ub300\uce6d\uc801 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uace0 \uc9c1\uad00\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\ub2ec\ud558\ub294 \uc288\ud37c\ud0c0\uc6d0\ud615 \ud29c\ube0c\ub97c \uc124\uacc4 \ubc0f \uad6c\ud604\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.

DeepLog introduces building blocks and primitives for\nneurosymbolic AI that make abstraction of commonly used representations and\ncomputational mechanisms used in neurosymbolic AI. DeepLog can represent and\nemulate a wide range of neurosymbolic systems. It consists of two key\ncomponents. The first is the DeepLog language for specifying neurosymbolic\nmodels and inference tasks. This language consists of an annotated neural\nextension of grounded first-order logic, and makes abstraction of the type of\nlogic, e.g. boolean, fuzzy or probabilistic, and whether logic is used in the\narchitecture or in the loss function. The second DeepLog component is situated\nat the computational level and uses extended algebraic circuits as\ncomputational graphs. Together these two components are to be considered as a\nneurosymbolic abstract machine, with the DeepLog language as the intermediate\nlevel of abstraction and the circuits level as the computational one. DeepLog\nis implemented in software, relies on the latest insights in implementing\nalgebraic circuits on GPUs, and is declarative in that it is easy to obtain\ndifferent neurosymbolic models by making different choices for the underlying\nalgebraic structures and logics. The generality and efficiency of the DeepLog\nneurosymbolic machine is demonstrated through an experimental comparison\nbetween 1) different fuzzy and probabilistic logics, 2) between using logic in\nthe architecture or in the loss function, and 3) between a standalone CPU-based\nimplementation of a neurosymbolic AI system and a DeepLog GPU-based one.", "AI": {"tldr": "DeepLog\ub294 \uc2e0\uacbd\uae30\ud638 AI\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ubc0f \uc6b4\uc601\uc801 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc2e0\uacbd\uae30\ud638 AI\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \ud45c\ud604\uacfc \uacc4\uc0b0 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ube4c\ub529 \ube14\ub85d\uacfc \uc6d0\uc2dc \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2e0\uacbd\uae30\ud638 AI\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uacfc \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "DeepLog \uc5b8\uc5b4\ub294 \uc2e0\uacbd\uae30\ud638 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ucd94\ub860 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc9c0\uc815\ud558\uba70, \ud655\uc7a5\ub41c \ub300\uc218 \ud68c\ub85c\ub97c \uacc4\uc0b0 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "DeepLog\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud37c\uc9c0 \ubc0f \ud655\ub960 \ub17c\ub9ac\uc640\uc758 \ube44\uad50 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc77c\ubc18\uc131\uacfc \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "DeepLog\ub294 \uc2e0\uacbd\uae30\ud638 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \ub2e8\uc21c\ud654\ud558\uace0 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\uc640 \ub17c\ub9ac\ub97c \uc27d\uac8c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 DeepLog\ub77c\ub294 \uc2e0\uacbd\uae30\ud638 AI\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ubc0f \uc6b4\uc601\uc801 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

But what does it mean for an algorithm to be opaque? Highly\ncomplex algorithms such as artificial neural networks process enormous volumes\nof data in parallel along multiple hidden layers of interconnected nodes,\nrendering their inner workings epistemically inaccessible to any human being,\nincluding their designers and developers; they are \"black boxes\" for all their\nstakeholders. But opaqueness is not always the inevitable result of technical\ncomplexity. Sometimes, the way an algorithm works is intentionally hidden from\nview for proprietary reasons, especially in commercial automated decision\nsystems, creating an entirely different type of opaqueness.

This limitation undermines their performance in terms of\ncoordination and planning in dynamic environments. We address this challenge\nwith CausalPlan, a two-phase framework that integrates explicit structural\ncausal reasoning into the LLM planning process. At the core of CausalPlan is\nthe Structural Causal Action (SCA) model, which learns a causal graph from\nagent trajectories to capture how prior actions and current environment states\ninfluence future decisions. This structure is then used to guide action\nselection by assigning causal scores to LLM-generated proposals, reweighting\nthem accordingly, or falling back to causally grounded alternatives when\nneeded. By embedding this causal knowledge directly into the decision loop,\nCausalPlan constrains planning to intervention-consistent behaviours without\nrequiring fine-tuning of the LLM itself. We evaluate CausalPlan on the\nOvercooked-AI benchmark across five multi-agent coordination tasks and four\nLLMs of varying sizes: Gemma-7B, Llama-8B, Qwen-14B, and Llama-70B.\nExperimental results show that CausalPlan consistently reduces invalid actions\nand improves collaboration in both AI-AI and human-AI settings, outperforming\nstrong reinforcement learning baselines.

Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely explored\nfor building controls because of its model-free nature. Open-source simulation\ntestbeds are essential not only for training RL agents but also for fairly\nbenchmarking control strategies. However, most building-sector testbeds target\nsingle buildings; multi-building platforms are relatively limited and typically\nrely on simplified models (e.g., Resistance-Capacitance) or data-driven\napproaches, which lack the ability to fully capture the physical intricacies\nand intermediate variables necessary for interpreting control performance.\nMoreover, these platforms often impose fixed inputs, outputs, and model\nformats, restricting their applicability as benchmarking tools across diverse\ncontrol scenarios. To address these gaps, MuFlex, a scalable, open-source\nplatform for benchmarking and testing control strategies for multi-building\nflexibility coordination, was developed in this study.

While recent advancements in Large Language\nModels (LLMs) show promise in supporting MDM, single-LLM approaches are limited\nby their parametric knowledge constraints and static training corpora, failing\nto robustly integrate the clinical information. To address this challenge, we\npropose the Expertise-aware Multi-LLM Recruitment and Collaboration (EMRC)\nframework to enhance the accuracy and reliability of MDM systems. It operates\nin two stages: (i) expertise-aware agent recruitment and (ii) confidence- and\nadversarial-driven multi-agent collaboration. Specifically, in the first stage,\nwe use a publicly available corpus to construct an LLM expertise table for\ncapturing expertise-specific strengths of multiple LLMs across medical\ndepartment categories and query difficulty levels. This table enables the\nsubsequent dynamic selection of the optimal LLMs to act as medical expert\nagents for each medical query during the inference phase. In the second stage,\nwe employ selected agents to generate responses with self-assessed confidence\nscores, which are then integrated through the confidence fusion and adversarial\nvalidation to improve diagnostic reliability. We evaluate our EMRC framework on\nthree public MDM datasets, where the results demonstrate that our EMRC\noutperforms state-of-the-art single- and multi-LLM methods, achieving superior\ndiagnostic performance. For instance, on the MMLU-Pro-Health dataset, our EMRC\nachieves 74.45% accuracy, representing a 2.69% improvement over the\nbest-performing closed-source model GPT- 4-0613, which demonstrates the\neffectiveness of our expertise-aware agent recruitment strategy and the agent\ncomplementarity in leveraging each LLM's specialized capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "EMRC

However, recent risk\nprediction research has shown that predictive tests formed on existing common\ngenetic loci, including those from genome-wide association studies, have lacked\nsufficient accuracy for clinical use. Because most rare variants on the genome\nhave not yet been studied for their role in risk prediction, future disease\nprediction discoveries should shift toward a more comprehensive risk prediction\nstrategy that takes into account both common and rare variants. We are\nproposing a collapsing receiver operating characteristic CROC approach for risk\nprediction research on both common and rare variants. The new approach is an\nextension of a previously developed forward ROC FROC approach, with additional\nprocedures for handling rare variants. The approach was evaluated through the\nuse of 533 single-nucleotide polymorphisms SNPs in 37 candidate genes from the\nGenetic Analysis Workshop 17 mini-exome data set.

However, despite the emergence of various RAG frameworks, a\nsingle RAG framework still cannot adapt well to a broad range of downstream\ntasks. Therefore, how to leverage the advantages of multiple RAG systems has\nbecome an area worth exploring. To address this issue, we have conducted a\ncomprehensive and systematic investigation into ensemble methods based on RAG\nsystems. Specifically, we have analyzed the RAG ensemble framework from both\ntheoretical and mechanistic analysis perspectives. From the theoretical\nanalysis, we provide the first explanation of the RAG ensemble framework from\nthe perspective of information entropy. In terms of mechanism analysis, we have\nexplored the RAG ensemble framework from both the pipeline and module levels.\nWe carefully select four different pipelines (Branching, Iterative, Loop, and\nAgentic) and three different modules (Generator, Retriever, and Reranker) to\nsolve seven different research questions.

The risk of acquiring MRSA and suffering life-threatening\nconsequences due to it remains especially high for hospitalized patients due to\na unique combination of factors, including: co-morbid conditions, immuno\nsuppression, antibiotic use, and risk of contact with contaminated hospital\nworkers and equipment. In this paper, we present a novel generative\nprobabilistic model, GenHAI, for modeling sequences of MRSA test results\noutcomes for patients during a single hospitalization.

Previous work proposed a framework consisting of\nthree steps: the LLM first generates a summary and then a strategy for the\ndomain, both in natural language, and then implements that strategy as a Python\nprogram, that gets debugged on example planning tasks. In that work, only one\nstrategy is generated and passed directly to the program generation. If the\nstrategy is incorrect, its implementation will therefore result in an incorrect\ngeneralized plan. Here, we introduce an approach that generates the strategy in\nthe form of pseudocode and enables automatic debugging of the pseudocode, hence\nallowing us to identify and fix errors prior to the generation of the\ngeneralized plan itself. Additionally, we extend the Python debugging phase\nwith a reflection step prompting the LLM to pinpoint the reason for the\nobserved plan failure. Finally, we take inspiration from LLM code generation to\nproduce several program variants and pick the best one. Running experiments on\n17 benchmark domains, we show that these extensions substantially improve (and\nnever deteriorate) the quality of the generalized plans. In 12 of the domains,\nour best Python programs solve all tasks that can be generated with the\nrespective instance generator.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMs\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c PDDL \uacc4\ud68d\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub41c \uacc4\ud68d \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd \uc18c\uac1c.", "motivation": "PDDL \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ud544\uc694\uc131.", "method": "\uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc758\uc0ac\ucf54\ub4dc \ud615\ud0dc\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uc790\ub3d9 \ub514\ubc84\uae45 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \uc0ac\uc804\uc5d0 \uc2dd\ubcc4 \ubc0f \uc218\uc815.", "result": "\ud655\uc7a5\ub41c \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 17\uac1c\uc758 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub41c \uacc4\ud68d\uc758 \ud488\uc9c8\uc774 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub428\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90c.", "conclusion": "12\uac1c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uace0\uc758 Python \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc774 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud568.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc LLM\uc740 PDDL \uacc4\ud68d\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub41c \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\ub294 Python \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uc804 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 LLM\uc774 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4\ub85c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc758 \uc694\uc57d\uacfc \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c \ub2e4\uc74c, \ud574\ub2f9 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 Python \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\ud604\ud558\uace0, \uc608\uc81c \uacc4\ud68d \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub514\ubc84\uae45\ud558\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud558\ub098\uc758 \uc804\ub7b5\ub9cc \uc0dd\uc131\ub418\uc5b4 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8 \uc0dd\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c1\uc811 \uc804\ub2ec\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9cc\uc57d \uc804\ub7b5\uc774 \uc798\ubabb\ub418\uba74 \uadf8 \uad6c\ud604\uc740 \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub41c \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5ec\uae30\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc758\uc0ac\ucf54\ub4dc \ud615\ud0dc\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uc774 \uc758\uc0ac\ucf54\ub4dc\ub97c \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ub514\ubc84\uae45\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uc5ec, \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub41c \uacc4\ud68d \uc0dd\uc131 \uc774\uc804\uc5d0 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0 \uc218\uc815\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, LLM\uc5d0\uac8c \uad00\ucc30\ub41c \uacc4\ud68d \uc2e4\ud328\uc758 \uc774\uc720\ub97c \ud2b9\uc815\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc694\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \ubc18\uc601 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub97c \ucd94\uac00\ud558\uc5ec Python \ub514\ubc84\uae45 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub97c \ud655\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c, LLM \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \uc5ec\ub7ec \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8 \ubcc0\ud615\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \ud558\ub098\ub97c \uc120\ud0dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. 17\uac1c\uc758 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5\uc774 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub41c \uacc4\ud68d\uc758 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba70 \uacb0\ucf54 \uc800\ud558\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. 12\uac1c\uc758 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uace0\uc758 Python \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc774 \uac01\uac01\uc758 \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4 \uc0dd\uc131\uae30\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

In this paper, we generalize the\nstandard SSCL methods to a Generalized Learning Framework (GLF) consisting of\ntwo parts: the aligning part and the constraining part. We analyze three\nexisting SSCL methods: BYOL, Barlow Twins, and SwAV, and show that they can be\nunified under GLF with different choices of the constraining part. We further\npropose empirical and theoretical analyses providing two insights into\ndesigning the constraining part of GLF: intra-class compactness and inter-class\nseparability, which measure how well the feature space preserves the class\ninformation of the inputs. However, since SSCL can not use labels, it is\nchallenging to design a constraining part that satisfies these properties.

While Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) frameworks streamline\nmodel development, they often lack adaptability and responsiveness to\ndomain-specific needs and evolving objectives. Concurrently, Large Language\nModels (LLMs) have enabled agentic systems capable of reasoning, memory\nmanagement, and dynamic code generation, offering a path toward more flexible\nworkflow automation. In this paper, we introduce \\textsf{TS-Agent}, a modular\nagentic framework designed to automate and enhance time-series modeling\nworkflows for financial applications. The agent formalizes the pipeline as a\nstructured, iterative decision process across three stages: model selection,\ncode refinement, and fine-tuning, guided by contextual reasoning and\nexperimental feedback. Central to our architecture is a planner agent equipped\nwith structured knowledge banks, curated libraries of models and refinement\nstrategies, which guide exploration, while improving interpretability and\nreducing error propagation. \\textsf{TS-Agent} supports adaptive learning,\nrobust debugging, and transparent auditing, key requirements for high-stakes\nenvironments such as financial services.

This paper investigates\nthese dynamics in the cooperative context of a multi-echelon supply chain, a\nsystem famously prone to instabilities like the bullwhip effect. We conduct\ncomputational experiments with generative AI agents, powered by Large Language\nModels (LLMs), within a controlled supply chain simulation designed to isolate\ntheir behavioral tendencies. Our central finding is the \"collaboration\nparadox\": a novel, catastrophic failure mode where theoretically superior\ncollaborative AI agents, designed with Vendor-Managed Inventory (VMI)\nprinciples, perform even worse than non-AI baselines. We demonstrate that this\nparadox arises from an operational flaw where agents hoard inventory, starving\nthe system. We then show that resilience is only achieved through a synthesis\nof two distinct layers: high-level, AI-driven proactive policy-setting to\nestablish robust operational targets, and a low-level, collaborative execution\nprotocol with proactive downstream replenishment to maintain stability. Our\nfinal framework, which implements this synthesis, can autonomously generate,\nevaluate, and quantify a portfolio of viable strategic choices.

Despite its\ntheoretical appeal, partial identification remains underutilized in applied\nwork, in part due to the fragmented nature of existing methods and the lack of\npractical guidance. This thesis addresses these challenges by systematically\ncomparing a diverse set of bounding algorithms across multiple causal\nscenarios. We implement, extend, and unify state-of-the-art methods - including\nsymbolic, optimization-based, and information-theoretic approaches - within a\ncommon evaluation framework. In particular, we propose an extension of a\nrecently introduced entropy-bounded method, making it applicable to\ncounterfactual queries such as the Probability of Necessity and Sufficiency\n(PNS). Our empirical study spans thousands of randomized simulations involving\nboth discrete and continuous data-generating processes. We assess each method\nin terms of bound tightness, computational efficiency, and robustness to\nassumption violations. To support practitioners, we distill our findings into a\npractical decision tree for algorithm selection and train a machine learning\nmodel to predict the best-performing method based on observable data\ncharacteristics.\n  All implementations are released as part of an open-source Python package,\nCausalBoundingEngine, which enables users to apply and compare bounding methods\nthrough a unified

While mobile network servers have ample\ncomputational resources to support larger models than client devices, privacy\nconstraints prevent clients from directly sharing their raw data. Federated\nLearning (FL) enables decentralized clients to collaboratively train a shared\nmodel by exchanging model parameters instead of transmitting raw data. Yet, it\nrequires a uniform model architecture and multiple communication rounds, which\nneglect resource heterogeneity, impose heavy computational demands on clients,\nand increase communication overhead. To address these challenges, we propose\nFedOL, to construct a larger and more comprehensive server model in one-shot\nsettings (i.e., in a single communication round). Instead of model parameter\nsharing, FedOL employs knowledge distillation, where clients only exchange\nmodel prediction outputs on an unlabeled public dataset. This reduces\ncommunication overhead by transmitting compact predictions instead of full\nmodel weights and enables model customization by allowing heterogeneous model\narchitectures. A key challenge in this setting is that client predictions may\nbe biased due to skewed local data distributions, and the lack of ground-truth\nlabels in the public dataset further complicates reliable learning.

While\nneural network weight generation shows promise, current approaches struggle\nwith generalization to unseen tasks and practical application exploration. To\naddress this, we propose T2W, a diffusion transformer framework that generates\ntask-specific weights conditioned on natural language descriptions.

This work, in a\nnatural and direct manner, clarifies how LR should be updated automatically\nonly according to the intrinsic variation of stochastic gradients. An\nexplainable LR regime by leveraging stochastic second-order algorithms is\ndeveloped, behaving a similar pattern to heuristic algorithms but implemented\nsimply without any parameter tuning requirement, where it is of an automatic\nprocedure that LR should increase (decrease) as the norm of stochastic\ngradients decreases (increases). The resulting LR regime shows its efficiency,\nrobustness, and scalability in different classical stochastic algorithms,\ncontaining SGD, SGDM, and SIGNSGD, on machine learning tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ub960(LR)\uc744 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uacbd\ub7c9\uc758 \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0\ub9cc \uc758\uc874\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 LR \uc870\uc815 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ucd94\uac00\uc801\uc778 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \uc870\uc815\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uc5ec, \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c \ub9c9\ub300\ud55c \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uacfc \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud655\ub960\uc801 2\ucc28 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc790\ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c LR\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc600\uace0, \ud559\uc2b5\ub960\uc740 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uacbd\ub7c9\uc758 \ub178\ub984\uc774 \uac10\uc18c(\uc99d\uac00)\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc99d\uac00(\uac10\uc18c)\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\ud604\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774 \uacb0\uacfc\ub85c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ub41c LR \uc870\uc815 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uace0\uc804\uc801\uc778 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998(SGD, SGDM, SIGNSGD)\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uac15\uac74\uc131, \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \uc870\uc815 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc790\ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c LR\uc744 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud604\ub300 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uacbd\ub7c9 \ud558\uac15\ubc95(SGD)\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ud6c8\ub828\ub418\uba70, \uadf8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc740 \ud559\uc2b5\ub960(LR)\uc774 \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc870\uc815\ub418\uace0 \uac10\uc18c\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ud06c\uac8c \ub2ec\ub77c\uc9c4\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uae30\uc874\uc758 LR \uccb4\uacc4\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ud558\ub098 \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \ucd94\uac00 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130\ub97c \uc218\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc815\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\uc544, \uc2e4\uc81c\ub85c\ub294 \ub9c9\ub300\ud55c \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uacfc \uc2dc\uac04\uacfc \uc804\ub825\uc744 \uc18c\ubaa8\ud558\ub294 \ubcd1\ubaa9\ud604\uc0c1\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 LR\uc774 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uacbd\ub7c9\uc758 \ub0b4\uc7ac\uc801 \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub418\uc5b4\uc57c \ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7fd\uace0 \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc124\uba85\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc218\ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \uc870\uc815 \uc694\uad6c \uc5c6\uc774 \uac04\ub2e8\ud558\uac8c \uad6c\ud604\ub41c \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uacfc \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\ub294 \ud655\ub960\uc801 2\ucc28 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uc124\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c LR \uccb4\uacc4\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uacbd\ub7c9\uc758 \ub178\ub984\uc774 \uac10\uc18c(\uc99d\uac00)\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c LR\uc774 \uc99d\uac00(\uac10\uc18c)\ud558\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9\uc801 \uc808\ucc28\ub97c \ub530\ub978\ub2e4. \uadf8 \uacb0\uacfc \ub3c4\ucd9c\ub41c LR \uccb4\uacc4\ub294 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c SGD, SGDM \ubc0f SIGNSGD\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uace0\uc804\uc801 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131, \uac15\uac74\uc131 \ubc0f \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4."}}

In subgraph\nfederated learning (FL), this data is distributed across clients, each with a\nlocal subgraph. Personalized subgraph FL aims to develop a customized model for\neach client to handle diverse data distributions. However, performance\nvariation across clients remains a key issue due to the heterogeneity of local\nsubgraphs. To overcome the challenge, we propose FedSheafHN, a novel framework\nbuilt on a sheaf collaboration mechanism to unify enhanced client descriptors\nwith efficient personalized model generation. Specifically, FedSheafHN embeds\neach client's local subgraph into a server-constructed collaboration graph by\nleveraging graph-level embeddings and employing sheaf diffusion within the\ncollaboration graph to enrich client representations. Subsequently, FedSheafHN\ngenerates customized client models via a server-optimized hypernetwork.\nEmpirical evaluations demonstrate that FedSheafHN outperforms existing\npersonalized subgraph FL methods on various graph datasets.

Across multiple benchmarks, GRAFT\nmatches or exceeds recent selection baselines in both accuracy and efficiency,\nproviding a favorable trade-off between accuracy, efficiency, and emissions.", "AI": {"tldr": "GRAFT\ub294 \ucd94\uac00\ub41c \uc11c\ube0c\uc14b \uc120\ud0dd \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c, \ud559\uc2b5 \uc911\uc5d0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \ud658\uacbd \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud604\ub300 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc744 \ud070 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c\ub098 \ud658\uacbd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4e0\ub2e4.", "method": "GRAFT\ub294 (i) \uac01 \ubc30\uce58\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc800\ucc28\uc6d0 \ud2b9\uc9d5 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\uace0, (ii) Fast MaxVol \uc0d8\ud50c\ub7ec\ub97c \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubc30\uce58\uc758 \uc9c0\ubc30\uc801\uc778 \uc11c\ube0c\uc2a4\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \uc791\uace0 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc11c\ube0c\uc14b\uc744 \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\uba70, (iii) \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uadfc\uc0ac \uae30\uc900\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc11c\ube0c\uc14b \ud06c\uae30\ub97c \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "GRAFT\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc640 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uadfc\uc758 \uc120\ud0dd \uae30\uc900\uacfc \ub3d9\ub4f1\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc774\ub97c \ucd08\uacfc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "GRAFT\ub294 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4, \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \ubc0f \ubc30\ucd9c\ub7c9 \uac04\uc758 \uc720\ub9ac\ud55c \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \ud604\ub300 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c\ub098 \ud658\uacbd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4ed\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 (i) \uac01 \ubc30\uce58\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc800\ucc28\uc6d0 \ud2b9\uc9d5 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\uace0, (ii) Fast MaxVol \uc0d8\ud50c\ub7ec\ub97c \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubc30\uce58\uc758 \uc9c0\ubc30\uc801\uc778 \uc11c\ube0c\uc2a4\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \uc791\uace0 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc11c\ube0c\uc14b\uc744 \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\uba70, (iii) \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uadfc\uc0ac \uae30\uc900\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc11c\ube0c\uc14b \ud06c\uae30\ub97c \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 GRAFT\ub77c\ub294 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud6c8\ub828 \uc911 \uc11c\ube0c\uc14b \uc120\ud0dd \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc800\ucc28\uc6d0 \uc11c\ube0c\uc2a4\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\uace0 \uc804\uccb4 \ubc30\uce58 \ub300\uc2e0 \uc2e0\uc911\ud558\uac8c \uc120\ud0dd\ub41c \uc608\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6c8\ub828\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 GRAFT\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828 \uada4\uc801\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba70 \ubcbd\uc2dc\uacc4 \uc2dc\uac04, \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc18c\ube44 \ubc0f CO2 \ubc30\ucd9c\ub7c9\uc744 \uc904\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c GRAFT\ub294 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc640 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uadfc \uc120\ud0dd \uae30\uc900\uacfc \uc77c\uce58\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc774\ub97c \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\uba70, \uc815\ud655\ub3c4, \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \ubc0f \ubc30\ucd9c\ub7c9 \uac04\uc758 \uc720\ub9ac\ud55c \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

In this work, we present a new scaling\nparadigm, Input Time Scaling, to complement previous scaling methods by putting\nresources on queries (input time). During training and testing, we combine\nmeta-knowledge from LLMs to refine inputs with different strategies. We also\nfind a new phenomenon, training-testing co-design there. We need to apply query\nstrategies during both training and testing. Only applying strategies on\ntraining or testing would seriously degrade the performance. We are also\nsurprised to find that seemingly low data quality datasets can gain high\nperformance. Adding irrelevant information to the queries, randomly selecting\nexamples from a minimally filtered dataset, can even perform the best. These\nfindings contradict the widely held inductive bias, \"garbage in, garbage out\".\nCurating datasets with seemingly high-quality data can even potentially limit\nthe performance ceiling. In addition, models trained on more data with similar\nquality (15k VS 1k) perform worse, simple dataset size scaling should also be\ncarefully inspected. The good news is that our findings are compatible with the\nLess is More phenomenon. A small set of examples is enough to evoke high-level\nreasoning ability. With experiments on models trained on Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct,\nwe are able to reach SOTA performance among 32B models on AIME24(76.7%) and\nAIME25(76.7%) pass@1. We can further achieve AIME24(76.7%) and AIME25(80%) with\na majority vote of three models. Starting from DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B,\nthe best result would be 86.7% on AIME24 and 76.7% on AIME25.

This work extends the CASH framework to select and\nadapt modern ML pipelines. We propose PS-PFN to efficiently explore and exploit\nadapting ML pipelines by extending Posterior Sampling (PS) to the max k-armed\nbandit problem setup. PS-PFN leverages prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) to\nefficiently estimate the posterior distribution of the maximal value via\nin-context learning. We show how to extend this method to consider varying\ncosts of pulling arms and to use different PFNs to model reward distributions\nindividually per arm. Experimental results on one novel and two existing\nstandard benchmark tasks demonstrate the superior performance of PS-PFN\ncompared to other bandit and AutoML strategies.

In particular, heavy-tailed linear bandits,\nenabling efficient learning with both a large number of arms and heavy-tailed\nnoises, have recently attracted significant attention\n\\citep{ShaoYKL18,XueWWZ20,ZhongHYW21,Wang2025heavy,tajdini2025improved}.\nHowever, prior studies focus almost exclusively on stochastic regimes, with few\nexceptions limited to the special case of heavy-tailed multi-armed bandits\n(MABs) \\citep{Huang0H22,ChengZ024,Chen2024uniINF}.\n  In this work, we propose a general framework for adversarial heavy-tailed\nbandit problems, which performs follow-the-regularized-leader (FTRL) over the\nloss estimates shifted by a bonus function. Via a delicate setup of the bonus\nfunction, we devise the first FTRL-type best-of-both-worlds (BOBW) algorithm\nfor heavy-tailed MABs, which does not require the truncated non-negativity\nassumption and achieves an $\\widetilde{O}(T^{\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}})$\nworst-case regret in the adversarial regime as well as an $\\widetilde{O}(\\log\nT)$ gap-dependent regret in the stochastic regime. We then extend our framework\nto the linear case, proposing the first algorithm for adversarial heavy-tailed\nlinear bandits with finite arm sets. This algorithm achieves an\n$\\widetilde{O}(d^{\\frac{1}{2}}T^{\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}})$ regret, matching the\nbest-known worst-case regret bound in stochastic regimes. Moreover, we propose\na general data-dependent learning rate, termed \\textit{heavy-tailed noise aware\nstability-penalty matching} (HT-SPM). We prove that HT-SPM guarantees BOBW\nregret bounds for general heavy-tailed bandit problems once certain conditions\nare satisfied.

In contrast, data-driven\napproaches provide strong and scalable performance when tailored to the\nstructure of specific datasets. Leveraging this idea, we focus on a\nsingle-machine scheduling problem where each job is defined by its weight,\nduration, due date, and deadline, aiming to minimize the total weight of tardy\njobs. We introduce a novel data-driven scheduling heuristic that combines\nmachine learning with problem-specific characteristics, ensuring feasible\nsolutions, which is a common challenge for ML-based algorithms. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art in terms of optimality gap, number of optimal solutions, and\nadaptability across varied data scenarios, highlighting its flexibility for\npractical applications.

The\nproposed model aims to address several key challenges, including privacy,\ninformation silos, class imbalance, non-identically and independently\ndistributed (Non-IID) data, and model interpretability in supply chain credit\nassessment. We introduce a performance-based client selection strategy (PBCS)\nto tackle class imbalance and Non-IID problems. This strategy achieves faster\nconvergence by selecting clients with higher local F1 scores.

We focus on the\nThompson Sampling (TS) algorithm, a Bayesian approach celebrated for its\nempirical performance and exploration efficiency, under the assumption of\nGaussian rewards with unknown parameters. Unlike conventional bandit objectives\nfocusing on maximizing cumulative reward, Sharpe ratio optimization instead\nintroduces an inherent tradeoff between achieving high returns and controlling\nrisk, demanding careful exploration of both mean and variance. Our theoretical\ncontributions include a novel regret decomposition specifically designed for\nthe Sharpe ratio, highlighting the role of information acquisition about the\nreward distribution in driving learning efficiency. Then, we establish\nfundamental performance limits for the proposed algorithm \\texttt{SRTS} in\nterms of an upper bound on regret.

We dissect the popular GRPO algorithm and\nreveal a systematic bias: the cumulative-advantage disproportionately weights\nsamples with medium accuracy, while down-weighting the low-accuracy instances\nthat are crucial for pushing reasoning boundaries. To rectify the depth\nneglect, we introduce Difficulty Adaptive Rollout Sampling (DARS), which\nre-weights hard problems through targeted multi-stage rollouts, thereby\nincreasing the number of positive rollouts for hard problems. Empirically,\nnaively enlarging rollout size only accelerates convergence and even hurts\nPass@K. Our DARS, in contrast, delivers consistent Pass@K gains without extra\ninference cost at convergence. Just as we adaptively expanded the depth of\nexploration, we now ask whether aggressively scaling the breadth of training\ndata can further amplify reasoning gains. To this end, we intensely scale batch\nsize and replace PPO's mini-batch iterations with full-batch updates over\nmultiple epochs. Increasing breadth significantly enhances Pass@1 performance.\nLarge-breadth training sustains high token-level entropy, indicating continued\nexploration and reduced gradient noise. We further present DARS-B, which\naugments DARS with large breadth, and demonstrate simultaneous gains in Pass@K\nand Pass@1. The results confirm that breadth and adaptive exploration across\ndepth operate as orthogonal dimensions in RLVR, which are key to unleashing the\nreasoning power of RLVR.", "AI": {"tldr": "RLVR\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae4a\uc774\uc640 \ud3ed\uc758 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc774 \uc81c\uc57d\ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.

Although Transformer-based models have made\nsignificant breakthroughs in forecasting, their effectiveness for time series\nforecasting remains debatable. In this paper, we revisit the significance of\nself-attention and propose a simple yet effective mechanism, Periodic-Nested\nGroup Attention, namely PENGUIN. Our approach highlights the importance of\nexplicitly modeling periodic patterns and incorporating relative attention bias\nfor effective time series modeling. To this end, we introduce a periodic-nested\nrelative attention bias that captures periodic structures directly. To handle\nmultiple coexisting periodicities (e.g., daily and weekly cycles), we design a\ngrouped attention mechanism, where each group targets a specific periodicity\nusing a multi-query attention mechanism.

This process is typically approached in two ways:\none-shot pruning, which involves a single pass of training and pruning, and\niterative pruning, where pruning is performed over multiple cycles for\npotentially finer network refinement. Although iterative pruning has\nhistorically seen broader adoption, this preference is often assumed rather\nthan rigorously tested. Our study presents one of the first systematic and\ncomprehensive comparisons of these methods, providing rigorous definitions,\nbenchmarking both across structured and unstructured settings, and applying\ndifferent pruning criteria and modalities. We find that each method has\nspecific advantages: one-shot pruning proves more effective at lower pruning\nratios, while iterative pruning performs better at higher ratios. Building on\nthese findings, we advocate for patience-based pruning and introduce a hybrid\napproach that can outperform traditional methods in certain scenarios,\nproviding valuable insights for practitioners selecting a pruning strategy\ntailored to their goals and constraints.

Federated Unlearning (FU) is emerging as a solution to address\nsuch vulnerabilities by selectively removing the influence of detected\nmalicious contributors on the global model without complete retraining.\nHowever, unlike typical FU scenarios where clients are trusted and cooperative,\napplying FU with malicious and possibly colluding clients is challenging\nbecause their collaboration in unlearning their data cannot be assumed. This\nwork presents FedUP, a lightweight FU algorithm designed to efficiently\nmitigate malicious clients' influence by pruning specific connections within\nthe attacked model. Our approach achieves efficiency by relying only on\nclients' weights from the last training round before unlearning to identify\nwhich connections to inhibit. Isolating malicious influence is non-trivial due\nto overlapping updates from benign and malicious clients. FedUP addresses this\nby carefully selecting and zeroing the highest magnitude weights that diverge\nthe most between the latest updates from benign and malicious clients while\npreserving benign information. FedUP is evaluated under a strong adversarial\nthreat model, where up to 50%-1 of the clients could be malicious and have full\nknowledge of the aggregation process.

Currently, the\nmost widely known evaluation framework is a comparative table from 1998, which\nno longer adequately captures recent technological developments or emerging\nvulnerabilities in biometric systems. To address these challenges, this work\nrevisits the evaluation of biometric modalities through an expert survey\ninvolving 24 biometric specialists. The findings indicate substantial shifts in\nproperty ratings across modalities. For example, face recognition, shows\nimproved ratings due to technological progress, while fingerprint, shows\ndecreased reliability because of emerging vulnerabilities and attacks.

Yoo"], "title": "Revisiting Diffusion Q-Learning: From Iterative Denoising to One-Step Action Generation", "comment": null, "summary": "The generative power of diffusion models (DMs) has recently enabled\nhigh-performing decision-making algorithms in offline reinforcement learning\n(RL), achieving state-of-the-art results across standard benchmarks. Among\nthem, Diffusion Q-Learning (DQL) stands out as a leading method for its\nconsistently strong performance. Nevertheless, DQL remains limited in practice\ndue to its reliance on multi-step denoising for action generation during both\ntraining and inference. Although one-step denoising is desirable, simply\napplying it to DQL leads to a drastic performance drop. In this work, we\nrevisit DQL and identify its core limitations. We then propose One-Step Flow\nQ-Learning (OFQL), a novel framework that enables efficient one-step action\ngeneration during both training and inference, without requiring auxiliary\nmodels, distillation, or multi-phase training. Specifically, OFQL reformulates\nDQL within the sample-efficient Flow Matching (FM) framework. While\nconventional FM induces curved generative trajectories that impede one-step\ngeneration, OFQL instead learns an average velocity field that facilitates\ndirect, accurate action generation. Collectively, OFQL eliminates the need for\nmulti-step sampling and recursive gradient updates in DQL, resulting in faster\nand more robust training and inference. Extensive experiments on the D4RL\nbenchmark demonstrate that OFQL outperforms DQL and other diffusion-based\nbaselines, while substantially reducing both training and inference time\ncompared to DQL.", "AI": {"tldr": "OFQL\uc740 DQL\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\uc810\uc744 \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uace0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 1\ub2e8\uacc4 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, D4RL \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c DQL\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc6b0\uc218\ud558\uace0 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubc0f \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ub2e8\ucd95\uc2dc\ud0b4.", "motivation": "Diffusion \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc0dd\uc131 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub192\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \uacb0\uc815\uc801 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "DQL\uc758 \uc7ac\uac80\ud1a0\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ubb38\uc81c\uc810\uc744 \ud30c\uc545\ud558\uace0, \ubcf4\uc870 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774\ub098 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc5c6\uc774 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 1\ub2e8\uacc4 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c OFQL \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "OFQL\uc740 DQL \ubc0f \ub2e4\ub978 \ud655\uc0b0 \uae30\ubc18 \uae30\uc900\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba74\uc11c \ud6c8\ub828 \ubc0f \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ub2e8\ucd95\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "OFQL\uc740 DQL\uc758 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uacfc \uc7ac\uadc0\uc801 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \uc81c\uac70\ud558\uc5ec \ub354 \ube60\ub974\uace0 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud6c8\ub828\uacfc \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378(DMs)\uc758 \uc0dd\uc131 \ub2a5\ub825\uc740 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc5d0\uc11c \uace0\uc131\ub2a5 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \ud45c\uc900 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8 \uc911\uc5d0\uc11c, Diffusion Q-Learning (DQL)\uc740 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\ub294 \uc120\ub3c4\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c \ub3cb\ubcf4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7fc\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 DQL\uc740 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubc0f \ucd94\ub860 \uacfc\uc815 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c \ud589\ub3d9 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ub178\uc774\uc988 \uc81c\uac70\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. 1\ub2e8\uacc4 \ub178\uc774\uc988 \uc81c\uac70\uac00 \ubc14\ub78c\uc9c1\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub97c DQL\uc5d0 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud788 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uba74 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uae09\uaca9\ud788 \ub5a8\uc5b4\uc9d1\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 DQL\uc744 \uc7ac\uac80\ud1a0\ud558\uace0 \uadf8 \ud575\uc2ec \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud655\uc778\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \ubcf4\uc870 \ubaa8\ub378, \uc99d\ub958 \ub610\ub294 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc5c6\uc774 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubc0f \ucd94\ub860 \ub3d9\uc548 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 1\ub2e8\uacc4 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 One-Step Flow Q-Learning (OFQL)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, OFQL\uc740 DQL\uc744 \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 Flow Matching (FM) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 FM\uc740 1\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \ubc29\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uace1\uc120 \uc0dd\uc131 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\ub294 \ubc18\uba74, OFQL\uc740 \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\ub294 \ud3c9\uade0 \uc18d\ub3c4 \uc7a5\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd1d\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c OFQL\uc740 DQL\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uacfc \uc7ac\uadc0\uc801 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uc5c6\uc560\uc5b4 \ub354 \ube60\ub974\uace0 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud6c8\ub828\uacfc \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Accurate forecasting of sewer overflow basin filling levels can\nprovide actionable insights for early intervention, helping mitigating\nuncontrolled discharge. In recent years, AI-based forecasting methods have\noffered scalable alternatives to traditional physics-based models, but their\nreliance on cloud computing limits their reliability during communication\noutages. To address this, we propose an end-to-end forecasting framework that\nenables energy-efficient inference directly on edge devices. Our solution\nintegrates lightweight Transformer and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models,\ncompressed via integer-only quantization for efficient on-device execution.\nMoreover, an automated hardware-aware deployment pipeline is used to search for\noptimal model configurations by jointly minimizing prediction error and energy\nconsumption on an AMD Spartan-7 XC7S15 FPGA. Evaluated on real-world sewer\ndata, the selected 8-bit Transformer model, trained on 24 hours of historical\nmeasurements, achieves high accuracy (MSE 0.0376) at an energy cost of 0.370 mJ\nper inference. In contrast, the optimal 8-bit LSTM model requires significantly\nless energy (0.009 mJ, over 40x lower) but yields 14.89% worse accuracy (MSE\n0.0432) and much longer training time. This trade-off highlights the need to\nalign model selection with deployment priorities, favoring LSTM for ultra-low\nenergy consumption or Transformer for higher predictive accuracy. In general,\nour work enables local, energy-efficient forecasting, contributing to more\nresilient combined sewer systems.

However, the nature of many\npractical decision-making problems favors a multimodal policy that facilitates\nrobust exploration of the environment and thus to address learning challenges\narising from sparse rewards, complex dynamics, or the need for strategic\nadaptation to varying contexts. This issue is exacerbated in continuous control\ndomains where exploration usually takes place in the vicinity of the predicted\noptimal action, either through an additive Gaussian noise or the sampling\nprocess of a stochastic policy. In this paper, we introduce Categorical\nPolicies to model multimodal behavior modes with an intermediate categorical\ndistribution, and then generate output action that is conditioned on the\nsampled mode. We explore two sampling schemes that ensure differentiable\ndiscrete latent structure while maintaining efficient gradient-based\noptimization. By utilizing a latent categorical distribution to select the\nbehavior mode, our approach naturally expresses multimodality while remaining\nfully differentiable via the sampling tricks. We evaluate our multimodal policy\non a set of DeepMind Control Suite environments, demonstrating that through\nbetter exploration, our learned policies converge faster and outperform\nstandard Gaussian policies. Our results indicate that the Categorical\ndistribution serves as a powerful tool for structured exploration and\nmultimodal behavior representation in continuous control.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc2ec\uce35 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubc94\uc8fc\ud615 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uacfc \ube60\ub978 \uc218\ub834\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "motivation": " \ub9ce\uc740 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uc815\ucc45\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubc94\uc8fc\ud615 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ub3d9\uc791\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uace0, \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\ub41c \ubaa8\ub4dc\uc5d0 \uc870\uac74\ud654\ub41c \ucd9c\ub825 \ub3d9\uc791\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uc815\ucc45\uc740 DeepMind Control Suite \ud658\uacbd \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uac1c\uc120\ub41c \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ub355\ubd84\uc5d0 \ud45c\uc900 \uac00\uc6b0\uc2dc\uc548 \uc815\ucc45\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ube60\ub974\uac8c \uc218\ub834\ud558\uace0 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc6b0\uc6d4\ud568\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubc94\uc8fc\ud615 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub294 \uc5f0\uc18d \uc81c\uc5b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ud0d0\uc0c9\uacfc \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ub3d9\uc791 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c\ub85c \uc791\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc2ec\uce35 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc815\ucc45\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac00\uc6b0\uc2dc\uc548 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub85c \ub9e4\uac1c\ud654\ub418\uc5b4 \ub2e8\uc77c \ubaa8\ub4dc \ud589\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\ud55c\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ub9ce\uc740 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \ubb38\uc81c\uc758 \ud2b9\uc131\uc740 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc120\ud638\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ud76c\uc18c \ubcf4\uc0c1, \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559 \ub610\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \uc801\uc751\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \uc5f0\uc18d \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc601\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c \ub354\uc6b1 \uc2ec\ud654\ub418\uba70, \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc740 \ubcf4\ud1b5 \uc608\uce21\ub41c \ucd5c\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9\uc758 \uadfc\ucc98\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c4\ud589\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc911\uac04 \ubc94\uc8fc\ud615 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ud589\ub3d9 \ubaa8\ub4dc\ub97c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubc94\uc8fc\ud615 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0, \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\ub41c \ubaa8\ub4dc\uc5d0 \uc870\uac74\ud654\ub41c \ucd9c\ub825 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ubbf8\ubd84 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc774\uc0b0 \uc7a0\uc7ac \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud589\ub3d9 \ubaa8\ub4dc\ub97c \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc7a0\uc7ac \ubc94\uc8fc\ud615 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \ud2b8\ub9ad\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \uc644\uc804\ud55c \ubbf8\ubd84 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7fd\uac8c \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec\uc131\uc744 \ud45c\ud604\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uc815\ucc45\uc744 DeepMind Control Suite \ud658\uacbd \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc5ec, \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \uc815\ucc45\uc774 \ub354 \ube60\ub974\uac8c \uc218\ub834\ud558\uace0 \ud45c\uc900 \uac00\uc6b0\uc2dc\uc548 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\ub294 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc784\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ubc94\uc8fc\ud615 \ubd84\ud3ec\uac00 \uc5f0\uc18d \uc81c\uc5b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ubc0f \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ud589\ub3d9 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c\ub85c \uc791\uc6a9\ud568\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Functional MRI (fMRI) offers a\nnon-invasive window into large-scale neural dynamics by measuring\nblood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals across the brain. These signals can\nbe modeled as interactions among Regions of Interest (ROIs), which are grouped\ninto functional communities based on their underlying roles in brain function.\nEmerging evidence suggests that connectivity patterns within and between these\ncommunities are particularly sensitive to ASD-related alterations. Effectively\ncapturing these patterns and identifying interactions that deviate from typical\ndevelopment is essential for improving ASD diagnosis and enabling biomarker\ndiscovery. In this work, we introduce ASDFormer, a Transformer-based\narchitecture that incorporates a Mixture of Pooling-Classifier Experts (MoE) to\ncapture neural signatures associated with ASD.

Since full retraining\nis costly, various machine unlearning methods have been proposed. In this\npaper, we firstly present an efficient knowledge graph (KG) unlearning\nalgorithm. We remark that KG unlearning is nontrivial due to the distinctive\nstructure of KG and the semantic relations between entities. Also, unlearning\nby estimating the influence of removed components incurs significant\ncomputational overhead when applied to large-scale knowledge graphs. To this\nend, we define an influence function for KG unlearning and propose to\napproximate the model's sensitivity without expensive computation of\nfirst-order and second-order derivatives for parameter updates. Specifically,\nwe use Taylor expansion to estimate the parameter changes caused by data\nremoval. Given that the first-order gradients and second-order derivatives\ndominate the computational load, we use the Fisher matrices and zeroth-order\noptimization to approximate the inverse-Hessian vector product without\nconstructing the computational graphs. Our experimental results demonstrate\nthat the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art graph unlearning\nbaselines significantly in terms of unlearning efficiency and unlearning\nquality.

In \\cite{hu}, the concept of typed topological space was\nintroduced and showed to have the potential for studying finite topological\nspaces, such as a dataset. It is a new method from the general topology\nperspective. A typed topological space is a topological space whose open sets\nare assigned types. Topological concepts and methods can be redefined using\nopen sets of certain types. In this article, we develop a special set of types\nand its related typed topology on a dataset $X$. Using it, we can investigate\nthe inner structure of $X$. In particular, $R^2$ has a natural quotient space,\nin which $X$ is organized into tracks, and each track is split into components.\nThose components are in a order. Further, they can be represented by an integer\nsequence. Components crossing tracks form branches, and the relationship can be\nwell represented by a type of pseudotree (called typed-II pseudotree).

However, like most deep learning models, MLIPs\nstruggle to make accurate predictions on out-of-distribution data or when\ntrained in a data-scarce regime, both common scenarios in simulation-based\nchemistry. Moreover, MLIPs do not provide uncertainty estimates by\nconstruction, which are fundamental to guide active learning pipelines and to\nensure the accuracy of simulation results compared to quantum calculations. To\naddress this shortcoming, we propose BLIPs: Bayesian Learned Interatomic\nPotentials. BLIP is a scalable, architecture-agnostic variational Bayesian\nframework for training or fine-tuning MLIPs, built on an adaptive version of\nVariational Dropout. BLIP delivers well-calibrated uncertainty estimates and\nminimal computational overhead for energy and forces prediction at inference\ntime, while integrating seamlessly with (equivariant) message-passing\narchitectures. Empirical results on simulation-based computational chemistry\ntasks demonstrate improved predictive accuracy with respect to standard MLIPs,\nand trustworthy uncertainty estimates, especially in data-scarse or heavy\nout-of-distribution regimes.

In these cases, preference feedback or expert\ndemonstrations can be used instead. However, existing approaches utilising both\ntogether are often ad-hoc, rely on domain-specific properties, or won't scale.\nWe develop a new framing for learning from human data, \\emph{reward-rational\npartial orderings over observations}, designed to be flexible and scalable.\nBased on this we introduce a practical algorithm, LEOPARD: Learning Estimated\nObjectives from Preferences And Ranked Demonstrations. LEOPARD can learn from a\nbroad range of data, including negative demonstrations, to efficiently learn\nreward functions across a wide range of domains. We find that when a limited\namount of preference and demonstration feedback is available, LEOPARD\noutperforms existing baselines by a significant margin. Furthermore, we use\nLEOPARD to investigate learning from many types of feedback compared to just a\nsingle one, and find that combining feedback types is often beneficial.", "AI": {"tldr": "LEOPARD \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uba70, \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\uc2dd\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc6b0\uc218\ud558\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc88b\uc740 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \uc9c0\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "LEOPARD(Preference And Ranked Demonstrations\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5)\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "LEOPARD\ub294 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "LEOPARD\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \uc720\ud615\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud560 \ub54c \uc774\uc810\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \uc21c\ucc28\uc801 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc791\uc5c5\uc774 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud560 \ub54c \uc88b\uc740 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \uc9c0\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc885\uc885 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b8 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacbd\uc6b0 \uc120\ud638 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc774\ub098 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc2dc\uc5f0\uc744 \ub300\uc2e0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0\ub97c \ud568\uaed8 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uc784\uc2dc\ubc29\ud3b8\uc801\uc774\uba70 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc18d\uc131\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc774 \uc5c6\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc778\uac04 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc778 '\uad00\ucc30\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1-\ud569\ub9ac\uc801 \ubd80\ubd84 \uc21c\uc11c'\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc720\uc5f0\ud558\uace0 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc124\uacc4\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 LEOPARD: \uc120\ud638 \ubc0f \uc21c\uc704 \ub9e4\uaca8\uc9c4 \uc2dc\uc5f0\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4.
