Of particular importance are membership inference attacks (MIAs), which exploit behavioral discrepancies between training and non-training data to determine whether a specific record was included in the model's training set, thereby presenting significant privacy risks. Although existing defenses, such as adversarial regularization, DP-SGD, and MemGuard, assist in mitigating these threats, they often entail trade-offs such as compromising utility, increased computational requirements, or inconsistent protection against diverse attack vectors.\n  In this paper, we introduce a novel inference-time defense mechanism called Neighborhood Blending, which mitigates MIAs without retraining the model or incurring significant computational overhead. Our approach operates post-training by smoothing the model's confidence outputs based on the neighborhood of a queried sample. By averaging predictions from similar training samples selected using differentially private sampling, our method establishes a consistent confidence pattern, rendering members and non-members indistinguishable to an adversary while maintaining high utility. Significantly, Neighborhood Blending maintains label integrity (zero label loss) and ensures high utility through an adaptive, \"pay-as-you-go\" distortion strategy. It is a model-agnostic approach that offers a practical, lightweight solution that enhances privacy without sacrificing model utility. Through extensive experiments across diverse datasets and models, we demonstrate that our defense significantly reduces MIA success rates while preserving model performance, outperforming existing post-hoc defenses like MemGuard and training-time techniques like DP-SGD in terms of utility retention.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubc31\uadf8\ub77c\uc6b4\ub4dc \ube14\ub80c\ub529\uc740

The extensions over standard Alice-and-Bob notation that we consider are non-deterministic choice, conditional branching, and mutable long-term memory.

This semantics entails an understanding of the protocol: it determines how agents parse and check incoming messages and how they construct outgoing messages, in the presence of an arbitrary algebraic theory and non-deterministic choices made by other agents.

Prior work has extensively explored the reinforcement learning approach, which involves learning response strategies through extensive simulation of the incident. While this approach can be effective, it requires handcrafted modeling of the simulator and suppresses useful semantics from raw system logs and alerts. To address these limitations, we propose to leverage large language models' (LLM) pre-trained security knowledge and in-context learning to create an end-to-end agentic solution for incident response planning. Specifically, our agent integrates four functionalities, perception, reasoning, planning, and action, into one lightweight LLM (14b model). Through fine-tuning and chain-of-thought reasoning, our LLM agent is capable of processing system logs and inferring the underlying network state (perception), updating its conjecture of attack models (reasoning), simulating consequences under different response strategies (planning), and generating an effective response (action). By comparing LLM-simulated outcomes with actual observations, the LLM agent repeatedly refines its attack conjecture and corresponding response, thereby demonstrating in-context adaptation.

These environments can include factors such as sensor drift, changing user behavior, device aging, and adversarial dynamics. Contrastive continual learning (CCL) combines contrastive representation learning with incremental adaptation, enabling robust feature reuse across tasks and domains. However, the geometric nature of contrastive objectives, when paired with replay-based rehearsal and stability-preserving regularization, introduces new security vulnerabilities. Notably, backdoor attacks can exploit embedding alignment and replay reinforcement, enabling the implantation of persistent malicious behaviors that endure through updates and deployment cycles. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of backdoor attacks on CCL within IoT systems. We formalize the objectives of embedding-level attacks, examine persistence mechanisms unique to IoT deployments, and develop a layered taxonomy tailored to IoT. Additionally, we compare vulnerabilities across various learning paradigms and evaluate defense strategies under IoT constraints, including limited memory, edge computing, and federated aggregation. Our findings indicate that while CCL is effective for enhancing adaptive IoT intelligence, it may also elevate long-lived representation-level threats if not adequately secured.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 IoT \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c CCL(\ub300\uc870 \uc9c0\uc18d \ud559\uc2b5)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubc31\ub3c4\uc5b4 \uacf5\uaca9\uc758 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "IoT \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub300\uc870 \uc9c0\uc18d \ud559\uc2b5(CCL)\uacfc \uc7ac\uc0dd \uae30\ubc18 \ub9ac\ud5c8\uc124 \ubc0f \uc548\uc815\uc131 \uc720\uc9c0\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc815\uaddc\ud654\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0, IoT \uace0\uc720\uc758 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc131 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uac80\ud1a0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "CCL\uc774 IoT \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ub370 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\ub098, \uc801\uc808\ud788 \ubcf4\ud638\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc744 \uacbd\uc6b0 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uc704\ud611\uc744 \ub192\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "CCL\uc758 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud559\uc2b5 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784 \uac04\uc758 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \ube44\uad50\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc0ac\ubb3c\uc778\ud130\ub137(IoT) \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ube44\uc815\uc801 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\ub294 \uc13c\uc11c \ub4dc\ub9ac\ud504\ud2b8, \ubcc0\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ud589\ub3d9, \uc7a5\uce58 \ub178\ud654, \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc5ed\ud559\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc694\uc778\uc774 \ud3ec\ud568\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \ub300\uc870 \uc9c0\uc18d \ud559\uc2b5(CCL)\uc740 \ub300\uc870 \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5\uacfc \uc810\uc9c4\uc801 \uc801\uc751\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc791\uc5c5 \ubc0f \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uac04\uc758 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uae30\ub2a5 \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc7ac\uc0dd \uae30\ubc18 \ub9ac\ud5c8\uc124 \ubc0f \uc548\uc815\uc131 \uc720\uc9c0\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc815\uaddc\ud654\uc640 \ud568\uaed8\ud560 \ub54c \ub300\uc870 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc758 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \ud2b9\uc131\uc740 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubcf4\uc548 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788, \ubc31\ub3c4\uc5b4 \uacf5\uaca9\uc740 \uc0bd\uc785 \uc815\ub82c \ubc0f \uc7ac\uc0dd \uac15\ud654 \ud65c\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8 \ubc0f \ubc30\ud3ec \uc8fc\uae30\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc9c0\uc18d\ub418\ub294 \uc545\uc758\uc801\uc778 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc2ec\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 IoT \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ub0b4 CCL\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubc31\ub3c4\uc5b4 \uacf5\uaca9\uc758 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc784\ubca0\ub529 \uc218\uc900 \uacf5\uaca9\uc758 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uace0, IoT \ubc30\ud3ec\uc5d0 \uace0\uc720\ud55c \uc9c0\uc18d\uc131 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uac80\ud1a0\ud558\uba70, IoT\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucd98 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ubd84\ub958\ubc95\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud559\uc2b5 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784 \uac04\uc758 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \ube44\uad50\ud558\uace0, \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac, \uc5e3\uc9c0 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305, \uc5f0\ud569 \uc9d1\uacc4\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c IoT \uc81c\uc57d \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc29\uc5b4 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 CCL\uc774 \uc801\uc751\ud615 IoT \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ub370 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc801\uc808\ud55c \ubcf4\uc548\uc774 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc9c0\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc744 \uacbd\uc6b0 \uc624\ub798 \uc9c0\uc18d\ub418\ub294 \ud45c\ud604 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc704\ud611\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b8\ub2e4."}}

While stationary strategies are preferred for their practicality, computing stationary forms of classic game-theoretic equilibria is computationally intractable -- a stark contrast to the comparative ease of solving single-agent RL or zero-sum games. To bridge this gap, we study Risk-averse Quantal response Equilibria (RQE), a solution concept rooted in behavioral game theory that incorporates risk aversion and bounded rationality. We demonstrate that RQE possesses strong regularity conditions that make it uniquely amenable to learning in MGs. We propose a novel two-timescale Actor-Critic algorithm characterized by a fast-timescale actor and a slow-timescale critic. Leveraging the regularity of RQE, we prove that this approach achieves global convergence with finite-sample guarantees.

However, existing AI safety benchmarks largely evaluate single agents, leaving multi-agent risks such as coordination failure and conflict poorly understood. We introduce GT-HarmBench, a benchmark of 2,009 high-stakes scenarios spanning game-theoretic structures such as the Prisoner's Dilemma, Stag Hunt and Chicken. Scenarios are drawn from realistic AI risk contexts in the MIT AI Risk Repository. Across 15 frontier models, agents choose socially beneficial actions in only 62% of cases, frequently leading to harmful outcomes. We measure sensitivity to game-theoretic prompt framing and ordering, and analyze reasoning patterns driving failures. We further show that game-theoretic interventions improve socially beneficial outcomes by up to 18%. Our results highlight substantial reliability gaps and provide a broad standardized testbed for studying alignment in multi-agent environments.

In this work, we propose \u0394Belief-RL, which leverages a language model's own intrinsic beliefs to reward intermediate progress. Our method utilizes the change in the probability an agent assigns to the target solution for credit assignment. By training on synthetic interaction data, \u0394Belief-RL teaches information-seeking capabilities that consistently outperform purely outcome-based rewards for Reinforcement Learning, with improvements generalizing to out-of-distribution applications ranging from customer service to personalization. Notably, the performance continues to improve as we scale test-time interactions beyond the training horizon, with interaction-efficiency increasing even on Pass@k metrics. Overall, our work introduces a scalable training strategy for navigating uncertainty over a long-horizon, by enabling credit assignment to intermediate actions via intrinsic \u0394Belief rewards.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uae34 \uc218\ud3c9\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uad50\uc721\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \u0394Belief-RL\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc18d\uc5d0\uc11c \uae34 \uc218\ud3c9\uc744 \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad50\uc721\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ucc3e\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "\u0394Belief-RL\uc740 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ub0b4\uc7ac\uc801 \uc2e0\ub150\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc911\uac04 \uc9c4\ud589\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc5d0 \ud560\ub2f9\ud558\ub294 \ud655\ub960\uc758 \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e0\uc6a9 \ud560\ub2f9\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud569\uc131 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc791\uc6a9 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c \uad50\uc721\ud558\uc5ec \u0394Belief-RL\uc740 \uc815\ubcf4 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uace0, \uacb0\uacfc \uae30\ubc18 \ubcf4\uc0c1\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uac1c\uc120\uc740 \uc18c\ube44\uc790 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \uac1c\uc778\ud654\uc5d0 \uc774\ub974\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc73c\ub85c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\u0394Belief \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc911\uac04 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e0\uc6a9 \ud560\ub2f9\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uae34 \uc218\ud3c9\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uad50\uc721 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uae34 \uc218\ud3c9\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ud6c8\ub828\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc744\uae4c\uc694? \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc911\uac04 \uc9c4\ud589\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ub0b4\uc7ac\uc801 \uc2e0\ub150\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \u0394Belief-RL\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc5d0 \ud560\ub2f9\ud558\ub294 \ud655\ub960\uc758 \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \uc2e0\uc6a9 \ud560\ub2f9\uc5d0 \uc774\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud569\uc131 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc791\uc6a9 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368, \u0394Belief-RL\uc740 \uc815\ubcf4 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \uac00\ub974\uce58\uace0, \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc21c\uc218\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc \uae30\ubc18 \ubcf4\uc0c1\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uac1c\uc120\uc740 \uace0\uac1d \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \uac1c\uc778\ud654\uc5d0 \uc774\ub974\ub294 \ubd84\ud3ec \uc678 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc73c\ub85c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788, \uc131\ub2a5\uc740 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc218\ud3c9\uc744 \ub118\uc5b4 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud655\uc7a5\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uacc4\uc18d \uac1c\uc120\ub418\uba70, Pass@k \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc804\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub0b4\uc7ac\uc801 \u0394Belief \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc911\uac04 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e0\uc6a9 \ud560\ub2f9\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \uae34 \uc218\ud3c9\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud6c8\ub828 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Rather than encoding all procedural knowledge within model weights, agent skills -- composable packages of instructions, code, and resources that agents load on demand -- enable dynamic capability extension without retraining. It is formalized in a paradigm of progressive disclosure, portable skill definitions, and integration with the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This survey provides a comprehensive treatment of the agent skills landscape, as it has rapidly evolved during the last few months. We organize the field along four axes: (i) architectural foundations, examining the SKILL.md specification, progressive context loading, and the complementary roles of skills and MCP; (ii) skill acquisition, covering reinforcement learning with skill libraries (SAGE), autonomous skill discovery (SEAgent), and compositional skill synthesis; (iii) deployment at scale, including the computer-use agent (CUA) stack, GUI grounding advances, and benchmark progress on OSWorld and SWE-bench; and (iv) security, where recent empirical analyses reveal that 26.1\\% of community-contributed skills contain vulnerabilities, motivating our proposed Skill Trust and Lifecycle Governance Framework -- a four-tier, gate-based permission model that maps skill provenance to graduated deployment capabilities. We identify seven open challenges -- from cross-platform skill portability to capability-based permission models -- and propose a research agenda for realizing trustworthy, self-improving skill ecosystems. Unlike prior surveys that broadly cover LLM agents or tool use, this work focuses specifically on the emerging skill abstraction layer and its implications for the next generation of agentic systems.

In particular, a major challenge in identifying high-quality training instances is trajectory evaluation - quantifying how much progress was made towards task completion. We introduce a novel constraint-based evaluation framework that provides fine-grained assessment of progress towards task completion. This enables us to leverage partially successful trajectories, which significantly expands the amount of usable training data. We evaluate our method on a new benchmark we propose called BookingArena, which consists of complex booking tasks across 20 popular websites, and demonstrate that our distilled student model outperforms open-source approaches and matches or exceeds commercial systems, while being a significantly smaller model.

The agent acts greedily with respect to an estimate of the value plus what can be seen as a value bonus. The value bonus can be learned by estimating a value function on reward bonuses, propagating local uncertainties around rewards. However, this approach only increases the value bonus for an action retroactively, after seeing a higher reward bonus from that state and action. Such an approach does not encourage the agent to visit a state and action for the first time. In this work, we introduce an algorithm for exploration called Value Bonuses with Ensemble errors (VBE), that maintains an ensemble of random action-value functions (RQFs). VBE uses the errors in the estimation of these RQFs to design value bonuses that provide first-visit optimism and deep exploration. The key idea is to design the rewards for these RQFs in such a way that the value bonus can decrease to zero. We show that VBE outperforms Bootstrap DQN and two reward bonus approaches (RND and ACB) on several classic environments used to test exploration and provide demonstrative experiments that it can scale easily to more complex environments like Atari.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 VBE(Value Bonuses with Ensemble errors)\ub77c\ub294 \ud0d0\ud5d8 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9-\uac00\uce58 \ud568\uc218\uc758 \uc559\uc0c1\ube14\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uc5ec \uccab \ubc29\ubb38 \uc2dc \uae0d\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uac00\uce58 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0 \uc2ec\uce35 \ud0d0\ud5d8\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc29\ud5a5\uc131 \ud0d0\ud5d8\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc73c\ub85c \ub099\uad00\uc801\uc778 \uac00\uce58 \ucd94\uc815\uce58\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud588\ub2e4.", "method": "VBE \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \ub79c\ub364 \ud589\ub3d9-\uac00\uce58 \ud568\uc218\uc758 \uc559\uc0c1\ube14\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud568\uc218\uc758 \ucd94\uc815 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud574 \uccab \ubc29\ubb38 \ub099\uad00\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \uac00\uce58 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "VBE\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ud0d0\ud5d8 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c Bootstrap DQN \ubc0f \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubcf4\ub108\uc2a4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd(RND \ubc0f ACB)\uc744 \ub2a5\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "VBE\ub294 Atari\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ub354 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \uc27d\uac8c \ud655\uc7a5\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\ub294 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub099\uad00\uc801\uc778 \uac00\uce58 \ucd94\uc815\uce58\ub294 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c0\ud5a5 \ud0d0\ud5d8\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud558\ub098\uc758 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uac00\uce58 \ucd94\uc815\uce58\uc640 \uac00\uce58 \ubcf4\ub108\uc2a4\ub77c\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ub354\ud55c \uac83\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud0d0\uc695\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud589\ub3d9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uac00\uce58 \ubcf4\ub108\uc2a4\ub294 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubcf4\ub108\uc2a4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac00\uce58 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \ucd94\uc815\ud558\uace0, \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc8fc\uc704\uc758 \uc9c0\uc5ed \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uc804\ud30c\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ud559\uc2b5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uc624\ud788\ub824 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubcf4\ub108\uc2a4\uac00 \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uace0 \ub098\uc11c\uc57c \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac00\uce58 \ubcf4\ub108\uc2a4\ub9cc\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ucc98\uc74c\uc73c\ub85c \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc640 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubc29\ubb38\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc7a5\ub824\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub79c\ub364 \ud589\ub3d9-\uac00\uce58 \ud568\uc218(RQFs)\uc758 \uc559\uc0c1\ube14\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ud0d0\ud5d8 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc778 \uac00\uce58 \ubcf4\ub108\uc2a4\uc640 \uc559\uc0c1\ube14 \uc624\ub958(VBE)\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Sycara", "Woojun Kim"], "title": "Theory of Mind Guided Strategy Adaptation for Zero-Shot Coordination", "comment": "Accepted at the 25th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS 2026)", "summary": "A central challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning is enabling agents to adapt to previously unseen teammates in a zero-shot fashion. Prior work in zero-shot coordination often follows a two-stage process, first generating a diverse training pool of partner agents, and then training a best-response agent to collaborate effectively with the entire training pool. While many previous works have achieved strong performance by devising better ways to diversify the partner agent pool, there has been less emphasis on how to leverage this pool to build an adaptive agent. One limitation is that the best-response agent may converge to a static, generalist policy that performs reasonably well across diverse teammates, rather than learning a more adaptive, specialist policy that can better adapt to teammates and achieve higher synergy. To address this, we propose an adaptive ensemble agent that uses Theory-of-Mind-based best-response selection to first infer its teammate's intentions and then select the most suitable policy from a policy ensemble. We conduct experiments in the Overcooked environment to evaluate zero-shot coordination performance under both fully and partially observable settings.

Previous RL-based methods have achieved breakthroughs in performance and interpretability but still remain concerns because of their reliance on AI-generated chain-of-thought (CoT) data and training strategies, which conflict with geographic characteristics. To address these issues, we first introduce GeoSeek, a new geolocation dataset comprising CoT data annotated by geographic experts and professional players. We further thoroughly explore the inherent characteristics of geographic tasks and propose a geo-similarity reward and a consistency reward assessed by a consistency agent to assist training. This encourages the model to converge towards correct answers from a geographic perspective while ensuring the integrity and consistency of its reasoning process.

This gap is primarily due to (i) the absence of high-quality, privacy-sensitive data that capture personalized user-LLM interactions at scale, and (ii) the lack of robust reward signals for individual preferences. To overcome existing data limitations, we introduce a high-fidelity synthetic data generation framework called PersonaGym. Unlike prior work that treats personalization as static persona-preference pairs, PersonaGym models a dynamic preference process via an agentic LLM system to simulate realistic preference behaviors and semantic-aware noise in order to generate personalized multi-turn interaction trajectories. Using PersonaGym, we release PersonaAtlas, a large-scale, high-quality, and diverse synthetic dataset of high-fidelity multi-turn personalized interaction trajectories that closely mirror real-world preference expression and noise patterns. We further propose Personalized Prompt Optimization (PPOpt), a scalable and model-agnostic framework that optimizes user prompts based on interaction histories without modifying the deployed LLM. PPOpt adopts a reason-then-optimize paradigm that infers an explicit user profile and conditions prompt rewriting on the user profile to avoid reward hacking. Our training procedure for PPOpt integrates a cold-start supervised prior with outcome-driven multi-objective reinforcement learning. We present extensive experiments to demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines in terms of task performance, personalization quality, and robustness to noisy as well as to sparse preference signals.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\uac00 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc5d0\uac8c \ubc30\ud3ec\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uae30\ud68c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc8fc\ub85c \uc791\uc5c5 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uace0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc120\ud638\ub3c4\uc640 \uac1c\ubcc4 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \uac04\uacfc\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 PersonaGym\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uace0\ucda9\uc2e4\ub3c4 \ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc0dd\uc131 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0, \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654(PPOpt) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc5d0\uac8c \ubc30\ud3ec\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud070 \uae30\ud68c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc8fc\ub85c \uc791\uc5c5 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc5d0 \uc911\uc810\uc744 \ub450\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc120\ud638\ub3c4\uc640 \uac1c\ubcc4 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \uac04\uacfc\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "PersonaGym\uc774\ub77c \ubd88\ub9ac\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \uc120\ud638 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c \ub2e4\uc911 \ud134 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uada4\uc801\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \uc120\ud638 \ud589\ub3d9\uacfc \uc758\ubbf8 \uc778\uc2dd \ub178\uc774\uc988\ub97c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 LLM \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c PPOpt\ub77c\ub294 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \ubaa8\ub378 \ube44\uc885\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "PersonaGym\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud574 \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c PersonaAtlas\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc138\uacc4\uc758 \uc120\ud638 \ud45c\ud604 \ubc0f \ub178\uc774\uc988 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ubc00\uc811\ud558\uac8c \ubc18\uc601\ud55c \uace0\ucda9\uc2e4\ub3c4 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud134 \uac1c\uc778\ud654 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uada4\uc801\uc758 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc774\ub2e4.

In this paper, we propose to scale strategies proven effective in small defender teams by integrating them as modular components of larger forces using our proposed framework. A dynamic programming (DP) decomposition assembles these components into large teams in polynomial time, enabling efficient construction of scalable defenses without exhaustive evaluation. Because a unit that is strong in isolation may not remain strong when combined, we sample across multiple small-team candidates. Our framework iterates between evaluating large-team outcomes and refining the pool of modular components, allowing convergence on increasingly effective strategies.

However, such algorithms often rely on rigid modeling assumptions and can perform poorly when demand distributions shift or relevant contextual information is unavailable. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have generated interest in AI agents that can reason flexibly and incorporate rich contextual signals, but it remains unclear how best to incorporate LLM-based methods into traditional decision-making pipelines.\n  We study how OR algorithms, LLMs, and humans can interact and complement each other in a multi-period inventory control setting. We construct InventoryBench, a benchmark of over 1,000 inventory instances spanning both synthetic and real-world demand data, designed to stress-test decision rules under demand shifts, seasonality, and uncertain lead times. Through this benchmark, we find that OR-augmented LLM methods outperform either method in isolation, suggesting that these methods are complementary rather than substitutes.\n  We further investigate the role of humans through a controlled classroom experiment that embeds LLM recommendations into a human-in-the-loop decision pipeline. Contrary to prior findings that human-AI collaboration can degrade performance, we show that, on average, human-AI teams achieve higher profits than either humans or AI agents operating alone. Beyond this population-level finding, we formalize an individual-level complementarity effect and derive a distribution-free lower bound on the fraction of individuals who benefit from AI collaboration; empirically, we find this fraction to be substantial.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc7ac\uace0 \uad00\ub9ac\uc5d0\uc11c LLM\uacfc OR \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998, \uc778\uac04 \uac04

Goodall", "Francesco Belardinelli"], "title": "Safe Reinforcement Learning via Recovery-based Shielding with Gaussian Process Dynamics Models", "comment": "Accepted at AAMAS 2026", "summary": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful framework for optimal decision-making and control but often lacks provable guarantees for safety-critical applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel recovery-based shielding framework that enables safe RL with a provable safety lower bound for unknown and non-linear continuous dynamical systems. The proposed approach integrates a backup policy (shield) with the RL agent, leveraging Gaussian process (GP) based uncertainty quantification to predict potential violations of safety constraints, dynamically recovering to safe trajectories only when necessary. Experience gathered by the 'shielded' agent is used to construct the GP models, with policy optimization via internal model-based sampling - enabling unrestricted exploration and sample efficient learning, without compromising safety.

However, current agents typically rely on fixed cognitive patterns: non-thinking models generate immediate responses, while thinking models engage in deep reasoning uniformly. This rigidity is inefficient for long-horizon tasks, where cognitive demands vary significantly from step to step, with some requiring strategic planning and others only routine execution. In this paper, we introduce CogRouter, a framework that trains agents to dynamically adapt cognitive depth at each step. Grounded in ACT-R theory, we design four hierarchical cognitive levels ranging from instinctive responses to strategic planning. Our two-stage training approach includes Cognition-aware Supervised Fine-tuning (CoSFT) to instill stable level-specific patterns, and Cognition-aware Policy Optimization (CoPO) for step-level credit assignment via confidence-aware advantage reweighting. The key insight is that appropriate cognitive depth should maximize the confidence of the resulting action. Experiments on ALFWorld and ScienceWorld demonstrate that CogRouter achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior efficiency.

We propose a regularized meta-learning framework that addresses these challenges through a four-stage pipeline combining redundancy-aware projection, statistical meta-feature augmentation, and cross-validated regularized meta-models (Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet). Our multi-metric de-duplication strategy removes near-collinear predictors using correlation and MSE thresholds ($\u03c4_{\\text{corr}}=0.95$), reducing the effective condition number of the meta-design matrix while preserving predictive diversity. Engineered ensemble statistics and interaction terms recover higher-order structure unavailable to raw prediction columns. A final inverse-RMSE blending stage mitigates regularizer-selection variance. On the Playground Series S6E1 benchmark (100K samples, 72 base models), the proposed framework achieves an out-of-fold RMSE of 8.582, improving over simple averaging (8.894) and conventional Ridge stacking (8.627), while matching greedy hill climbing (8.603) with substantially lower runtime (4 times faster). Conditioning analysis shows a 53.7\\% reduction in effective matrix condition number after redundancy projection. Comprehensive ablations demonstrate consistent contributions from de-duplication, statistical meta-features, and meta-ensemble blending.

However, the field currently lacks a standardized evaluation protocol, forcing researchers to rely on bespoke, isolated, and often simplistic environments. This fragmentation makes it difficult to assess the robustness, generalization, and failure modes of emerging methods. To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive benchmark suite for MFGs (Bench-MFG), focusing on the discrete-time, discrete-space, stationary setting for the sake of clarity. We introduce a taxonomy of problem classes, ranging from no-interaction and monotone games to potential and dynamics-coupled games, and provide prototypical environments for each. Furthermore, we propose MF-Garnets, a method for generating random MFG instances to facilitate rigorous statistical testing. We benchmark a variety of learning algorithms across these environments, including a novel black-box approach (MF-PSO) for exploitability minimization. Based on our extensive empirical results, we propose guidelines to standardize future experimental comparisons.

Despite rapid adoption, there is no standard way to measure whether they actually help.

Each task is evaluated under three conditions: no Skills, curated Skills, and self-generated Skills. We test 7 agent-model configurations over 7,308 trajectories. Curated Skills raise average pass rate by 16.2 percentage points(pp), but effects vary widely by domain (+4.5pp for Software Engineering to +51.9pp for Healthcare) and 16 of 84 tasks show negative deltas. Self-generated Skills provide no benefit on average, showing that models cannot reliably author the procedural knowledge they benefit from consuming.

To address this challenge, we present a novel model-based multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that unifies joint state-action representation learning with imaginative roll-outs. We design a world model trained with variational auto-encoders and augment the model using the state-action learned embedding (SALE). SALE is injected into both the imagination module that forecasts plausible future roll-outs and the joint agent network whose individual action values are combined through a mixing network to estimate the joint action-value function. By coupling imagined trajectories with SALE-based action values, the agents acquire a richer understanding of how their choices influence collective outcomes, leading to improved long-term planning and optimization under limited real-environment interactions. Empirical studies on well-established multi-agent benchmarks, including StarCraft II Micro-Management, Multi-Agent MuJoCo, and Level-Based Foraging challenges, demonstrate consistent gains of our method over baseline algorithms and highlight the effectiveness of joint state-action learned embeddings within a multi-agent model-based paradigm.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub2e4\uc218\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ubd80\ubd84\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad00\uce21 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub3d9\uc801 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c.", "motivation": "\ubd80\ubd84\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad00\uce21 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uace0\ub3c4\ub85c \ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc870\uc815\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4 \uc81c\uacf5 \ud45c\ud604 \ubc0f \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud6c8\ub828 \ud544\uc694.", "method": "\ubcc0\ubd84 \uc790\ub3d9 \uc778\ucf54\ub354\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uc0c1\ud0dc-\ud589\ub3d9 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc784\ubca0\ub529(SALE)\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc124\uacc4.", "result": "\uad6c\uc0c1\ub41c \uada4\uc801\uacfc SALE \uae30\ubc18 \ud589\ub3d9 \uac12\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc774 \uc120\ud0dd\uc774 \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc801 \uacb0\uacfc\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ub354\uc6b1 \ud48d\ubd80\ud558\uac8c \uc774\ud574\ud558\uac8c \ub428.", "conclusion": "StarCraft II \ub9c8\uc774\ud06c\ub85c \uad00\ub9ac, \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 MuJoCo, \ub808\ubca8 \uae30\ubc18 \ucc44\uc9d1 \ub3c4\uc804 \ub4f1 \uc798 \ud655\ub9bd\ub41c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\uc99d \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \uc785\uc99d.", "translated_summary": "\ubd80\ubd84\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad00\uce21 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uace0\ub3c4\ub85c \ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ub9ce\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc870\uc815\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uc815\ubcf4\uc801\uc778 \ud45c\ud604\uacfc \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud6c8\ub828\uc774 \ubaa8\ub450 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uacf5\ub3d9 \uc0c1\ud0dc-\ud589\ub3d9 \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5\uacfc \uc0c1\uc0c1 \ub864\uc544\uc6c3\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubcc0\ubd84 \uc790\ub3d9 \uc778\ucf54\ub354\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uace0, \uc0c1\ud0dc-\ud589\ub3d9 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc784\ubca0\ub529(SALE)\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ubcf4\uac15\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

We observe that many state-of-the-art open-source web agents rely on long tool-call trajectories with cyclic reasoning loops and exploration of unproductive branches. To address this, we propose WebClipper, a framework that compresses web agent trajectories via graph-based pruning. Concretely, we model the agent's search process as a state graph and cast trajectory optimization as a minimum-necessary Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) mining problem, yielding pruned trajectories that preserve essential reasoning while eliminating redundant steps. Continued training on these refined trajectories enables the agent to evolve toward more efficient search patterns and reduces tool-call rounds by about 20% while improving accuracy. Furthermore, we introduce a new metric called F-AE Score to measure the model's overall performance in balancing accuracy and efficiency.

Existing adaptation strategies rely on fine-tuning or retrieval-based augmentation, which introduce computational overhead, privacy constraints, or instability under long contexts. We introduce TRACE (Temporal Reasoning via Agentic Context Evolution), a framework that enables temporal clinical reasoning with frozen LLMs by explicitly structuring and maintaining context rather than extending context windows or updating parameters. TRACE operates over a dual-memory architecture consisting of a static Global Protocol encoding institutional clinical rules and a dynamic Individual Protocol tracking patient-specific state. Four agentic components, Router, Reasoner, Auditor, and Steward, coordinate over this structured memory to support temporal inference and state evolution. The framework maintains bounded inference cost via structured state compression and selectively audits safety-critical clinical decisions. Evaluated on longitudinal clinical event streams from MIMIC-IV, TRACE significantly improves next-event prediction accuracy, protocol adherence, and clinical safety over long-context and retrieval-augmented baselines, while producing interpretable and auditable reasoning traces.", "AI": {"tldr": "TRACE \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801 \ud658\uc790 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \uc778\uc2dd\ud558\uace0 \uc7a5\uae30\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc784\uc0c1 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc740 \ubc29\ub300\ud55c \uc758\ud559 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ub2f4\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud658\uc790\uc758 \uc7a5\uae30\uc801\uc778 \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uc788\uac8c \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "TRACE\ub294 \uc815\uc801 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uacfc \ub3d9\uc801 \uac1c\ubcc4 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \uc774\uc911 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uba70, \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uc720\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "MIMIC-IV\uc758 \uc7a5\uae30\uc801\uc778 \uc784\uc0c1 \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8 \uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9bc\uc5d0\uc11c TRACE\ub294 \ub2e4\uc74c \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8 \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc640 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c \uc900\uc218 \ubc0f \uc784\uc0c1 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "TRACE\ub294 \uc7a5\uae30 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ubc0f \uac80\uc0c9 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uac10\uc0ac \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc740 \ubc29\ub300\ud55c \uc758\ud559 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc554\ud638\ud654\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc9c4\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc784\uc0c1 \uc0c1\ud0dc, \ubd88\uaddc\uce59\ud55c \ud0c0\uc774\ubc0d \ubc0f \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc0ac\uac74\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc7a5\uae30\uc801\uc778 \ud658\uc790 \uacbd\uacfc\uc5d0 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uc788\uac8c \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc801\uc751 \uc804\ub7b5\uc740 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc774\ub098 \uac80\uc0c9 \uae30\ubc18 \uc99d\ub300\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc, \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc \uc81c\uc57d \ub610\ub294 \uae34 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubd88\uc548\uc815\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 TRACE(Temporal Reasoning via Agentic Context Evolution)\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \ub0c9\ub3d9\ub41c LLMs\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc784\uc0c1 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.

However, existing benchmarks for multimodal browsing remain limited in task complexity, evidence accessibility, and evaluation granularity, hindering comprehensive and reproducible assessments of deep search capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce BrowseComp-$V^3$, a novel benchmark consisting of 300 carefully curated and challenging questions spanning diverse domains. The benchmark emphasizes deep, multi-level, and cross-modal multi-hop reasoning, where critical evidence is interleaved across textual and visual modalities within and across web pages. All supporting evidence is strictly required to be publicly searchable, ensuring fairness and reproducibility. Beyond final-answer accuracy, we incorporate an expert-validated, subgoal-driven process evaluation mechanism that enables fine-grained analysis of intermediate reasoning behaviors and systematic characterization of capability boundaries. In addition, we propose OmniSeeker, a unified multimodal browsing agent framework integrating diverse web search and visual perception tools. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that even state-of-the-art models achieve only 36% accuracy on our benchmark, revealing critical bottlenecks in multimodal information integration and fine-grained perception.

Conventional FedAvg and many advanced methods can suffer from excessive drift and degraded convergence under these realistic constraints. This work introduces Fractional-Order Roughness-Informed Federated Averaging (FO-RI-FedAvg), a lightweight and modular extension of FedAvg that improves stability through two complementary client-side mechanisms: (i) adaptive roughness-informed proximal regularization, which dynamically tunes the pull toward the global model based on local loss-landscape roughness, and (ii) non-integer-order local optimization, which incorporates short-term memory to smooth conflicting update directions. The approach preserves standard FedAvg server aggregation, adds only element-wise operations with amortizable overhead, and allows independent toggling of each component. Experiments on two real-world BEV energy prediction datasets, VED and its extended version eVED, show that FO-RI-FedAvg achieves improved accuracy and more stable convergence compared to strong federated baselines, particularly under reduced client participation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud37c\uc9c0 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubd88\uc548\uc815\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c FO-RI-FedAvg \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5f0\uacb0\ub41c \uc804\uae30\ucc28\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \uac04\ud5d0\uc801\uc778 \uc5f0\uacb0, \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \ucc38\uc5ec \ubcc0\ud654, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc791\ub3d9 \uc870\uac74\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc720\ub3c4\ub41c \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uac04 \ucc28\uc774\ub85c \ubd88\uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \uacbd\ud5d8\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "FO-RI-FedAvg\ub294 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uce21\uc5d0\uc11c \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubcf4\uc644 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 FedAvg\uc758 \uacbd\ub7c9\ud654\ub41c \ud655\uc7a5\uc774\ub2e4: 1) \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uac70\uce60\uc74c \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uadfc\uc811 \uc815\uaddc\ud654, 2) \ube44\uc815\uc218 \ucc28\uc218\uc758 \uc9c0\uc5ed \ucd5c\uc801\ud654.", "result": "FO-RI-FedAvg\ub294 \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c BEV \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc608\uce21 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b(VED, eVED)\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc5f0\ud569 \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub41c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc640 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc218\ub834\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ud2b9\ud788 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \ucc38\uc5ec\uac00 \uac10\uc18c\ub41c \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c FO-RI-FedAvg\uac00 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc5f0\uacb0\ub41c \uc804\uae30\ucc28(BEV)\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \uac04\ud5d0\uc801\uc778 \uc5f0\uacb0, \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ubcc0\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \ucc38\uc5ec, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc791\ub3d9 \uc870\uac74\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc720\ubc1c\ub41c \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \ub69c\ub837\ud55c \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \ubd88\uc548\uc815\uc131\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 FedAvg \ubc0f \ub9ce\uc740 \uace0\uae09 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \uc81c\uc57d\uc5d0\uc11c \uacfc\ub3c4\ud55c \ub4dc\ub9ac\ud504\ud2b8\uc640 \uc800\ud558\ub41c \uc218\ub834\uc744 \uacbd\ud5d8\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 FedAvg\uc758 \uacbd\ub7c9\ud654\ub418\uace0 \ubaa8\ub4c8\ud654\ub41c \ud655\uc7a5\uc778 \ubd84\uc218 \ucc28\uc218 \uac70\uce60\uc74c \uc815\ubcf4 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud3c9\uade0\ud654(FO-RI-FedAvg)\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc0c1\ud638 \ubcf4\uc644\uc801\uc778 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uce21 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud55c\ub2e4: (i) \uc9c0\uc5ed \uc190\uc2e4 \uacbd\uad00\uc758 \uac70\uce60\uae30\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c\uc758 \ub04c\ub9bc\uc744 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uac70\uce60\uc74c \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uadfc\uc811 \uc815\uaddc\ud654\uc640, (ii) \ucda9\ub3cc \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \ubd80\ub4dc\ub7fd\uac8c \ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub2e8\uae30 \uae30\uc5b5\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \ube44\uc815\uc218 \ucc28\uc218\uc758 \uc9c0\uc5ed \ucd5c\uc801\ud654. \uc774 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \ud45c\uc900 FedAvg \uc11c\ubc84 \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba70, \uc624\uc9c1 \uc6d0\uc18c\ubcc4 \uc5f0\uc0b0\ub9cc \ucd94\uac00\ud558\uace0, \uac01 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\uc758 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \uc804\ud658\uc744 \ud5c8\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c BEV \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc608\uce21 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b(VED \ubc0f \uadf8 \ud655\uc7a5\ud310 eVED)\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, FO-RI-FedAvg\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc5f0\ud569 \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub41c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc640 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc218\ub834\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc5ec, \ud2b9\ud788 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \ucc38\uc5ec\uac00 \uc904\uc5b4\ub4e0 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4."}}

DOI: https://doi.org/10.65109/KRAP9309", "summary": "Assumption-based Argumentation (ABA) is a well-established form of structured argumentation. ABA frameworks with an underlying atomic language are widely studied, but their applicability is limited by a representational restriction to ground (variable-free) arguments and attacks built from propositional atoms. In this paper, we lift this restriction and propose a novel notion of constrained ABA (CABA), whose components, as well as arguments built from them, may include constrained variables, ranging over possibly infinite domains. We define non-ground semantics for CABA, in terms of various notions of non-ground attacks. We show that the new semantics conservatively generalise standard ABA semantics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc8fc\uc7a5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc81c\ud55c\uc744 \ud574\uc81c\ud558\uace0, \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uac1c\ub150\uc778 CABA\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 ABA \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\ub294 \uc8fc\uc7a5\uc774 \ubcc0\uc218 \uc5c6\uc774 \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uc81c\uc57d\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc751\uc6a9\uc5d0 \uc81c\ud55c\uc744 \ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c CABA \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \ube44\uadfc\ubcf8 \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc744 \uc815\uc758\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ube44\uadfc\ubcf8 \uacf5\uaca9 \uac1c\ub150\uacfc \uc5f0\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc774 \ud45c\uc900 ABA \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc744 \ubcf4\uc218\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c CABA\ub294 \uae30\uc874 ABA\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ub118\uc5b4 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc5f4\uc5b4\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac00\uc815 \uae30\ubc18 \ub17c\uc99d(ABA)\uc740 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ub17c\uc99d\uc758 \uc798 \ud655\ub9bd\ub41c \ud615\ud0dc\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uc5b8\uc5b4\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 ABA \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ub110\ub9ac \uc5f0\uad6c\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uadfc\ubcf8(\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294) \ub17c\uc99d\uacfc \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc6d0\uc790\uc5d0\uc11c \uad6c\ucd95\ub41c \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud45c\ud604 \uc81c\ud55c\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\uc744 \ud574\uc81c\ud558\uace0, \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\uc640 \uc774\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uad6c\ucd95\ub41c \ub17c\uc99d\uc774 \ubb34\ud55c\ud55c \uc601\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c ABA(CABA)\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ube44\uadfc\ubcf8 \uacf5\uaca9 \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \uae30\uc900\uc73c\ub85c CABA\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ube44\uadfc\ubcf8 \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc744 \uc815\uc758\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc774 \ud45c\uc900 ABA \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc744 \ubcf4\uc218\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Trajectory success rewards are suitable for human judges or model fitting, but the sparsity severely limits RL sample efficiency. While recent methods have effectively improved RL via dense rewards, they rely heavily on high-quality human-annotated data or abundant expert supervision. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes Dual-granularity contrastive reward via generated Episodic Guidance (DEG), a novel framework to seek sample-efficient dense rewards without requiring human annotations or extensive supervision. Leveraging the prior knowledge of large video generation models, DEG only needs a small number of expert videos for domain adaptation to generate dedicated task guidance for each RL episode. Then, the proposed dual-granularity reward that balances coarse-grained exploration and fine-grained matching, will guide the agent to efficiently approximate the generated guidance video sequentially in the contrastive self-supervised latent space, and finally complete the target task. Extensive experiments on 18 diverse tasks across both simulation and real-world settings show that DEG can not only serve as an efficient exploration stimulus to help the agent quickly discover sparse success rewards, but also guide effective RL and stable policy convergence independently.", "AI": {"tldr": "DEG\ub294 \uc778\uac04 \uc8fc\uc11d\uc774\ub098 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uac10\ub3c5 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc870\ubc00\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \ucc3e\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc801\ud569\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc5d0\uc11c \ud2b9\ud788 \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc778 \uc870\uc791\uc5d0 \ud070 \ub3c4\uc804\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "DEG\ub294 \ud070 \ube44\ub514\uc624 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc0ac\uc804 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac01 RL \uc5d0\ud53c\uc18c\ub4dc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc804\ub2f4 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc9c0\uce68\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "DEG\ub294 18\uac00\uc9c0 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2a4\ud30c\uc2a4 \uc131\uacf5 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \uc2e0\uc18d\ud558\uac8c \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc744 \uc8fc\uace0, \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 RL \ubc0f \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc815\ucc45 \uc218\ub834\uc744 \uc548\ub0b4\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 DEG\uac00 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uc790\uadf9\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc801\ud569\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL), \ud2b9\ud788 \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc778 \uc870\uc791\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacbd\ub85c \uc131\uacf5 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc740 \uc778\uac04 \ud310\ub2e8\uc790\ub098 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc801\ud569\uc5d0 \uc801\ud569\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uadf8 \ud76c\uc18c\uc131\uc774 RL \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uc2ec\uac01\ud558\uac8c \uc81c\ud55c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc774 \uc870\ubc00\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 RL\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub4e4\uc740 \uace0\ud488\uc9c8\uc758 \uc778\uac04 \uc8fc\uc11d \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub098 \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uac10\ub3c5\uc5d0 \ud06c\uac8c \uc758\uc874\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc778\uac04 \uc8fc\uc11d\uc774\ub098 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uac10\ub3c5 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc870\ubc00\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \ucd94\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \uc5d0\ud53c\uc18c\ub4dc \uc9c0\uce68\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \uc774\uc911 \uc138\ubd84\ud654 \ub300\ube44 \ubcf4\uc0c1(DEG)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Motivated by the limitations of classical optimal control under uncertainty and the need for interpretable decision making in safety critical aviation systems, we design a three stage Takagi Sugeno Kang fuzzy layer that modulates constraint radii, urgency levels, and activation decisions based on regulatory separation minima and airworthiness guidelines from FAA and EASA. These fuzzy-derived clearances are then incorporated as soft constraints into an optimal control problem solved using the FALCON toolbox and IPOPT. The framework aims to reduce unnecessary recomputations by selectively activating obstacle avoidance updates while maintaining compliance with aviation procedures. A proof of concept implementation using a simplified aircraft model demonstrates that the approach can generate optimal trajectories with computation times of 2,3 seconds per iteration in a single threaded MATLAB environment, suggesting feasibility for near real time applications. However, our experiments revealed a critical software incompatibility in the latest versions of FALCON and IPOPT, in which the Lagrangian penalty term remained identically zero, preventing proper constraint enforcement. This behavior was consistent across scenarios and indicates a solver toolbox regression rather than a modeling flaw. Future work includes validating this effect by reverting to earlier software versions, optimizing the fuzzy membership functions using evolutionary methods, and extending the system to higher fidelity aircraft models and stochastic obstacle environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubb34\uc778 \ud56d\uacf5\uae30\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc81c\uc57d \ucc98\ub9ac \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \ucd5c\uc801 \uc81c\uc5b4\uc640 \ud37c\uc9c0 \uaddc\uce59 \uae30\ubc18 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(FRBS)\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc7a5\uc560\ubb3c \ud68c\ud53c \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uace0\uc804\uc801 \ucd5c\uc801 \uc81c\uc5b4\uc758 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\uc640 \uc548\uc804-critical \ud56d\uacf5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ub3d9\uae30\ubd80\uc5ec\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "method": "FAA \ubc0f EASA\uc758 \uaddc\uc81c \ubd84\ub9ac \ucd5c\uc18c\uac12\uacfc \ube44\ud589 \uc548\uc804 \uc9c0\uce68\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc81c\uc57d \ubc18\uacbd, \uae34\uae09 \uc218\uc900 \ubc0f \ud65c\uc131\ud654 \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc870\uc808\ud558\ub294 3\ub2e8\uacc4 \ub2e4\uce74\uae30 \uc218\uac90 \uac15(Fuzzy Layer)\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud37c\uc9c0 \uc720\ub3c4 \uba85\ud655\uc131\uc740 \ucd5c\uc801 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ubd80\ub4dc\ub7ec\uc6b4 \uc81c\uc57d\uc73c\ub85c \ud1b5\ud569\ub418\uba70, FALCON \ud234\ubc15\uc2a4\uc640 IPOPT\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud574\uacb0\ub41c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uac04\uc18c\ud654\ub41c \ud56d\uacf5\uae30 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c \uac1c\ub150 \uc99d\uba85 \uad6c\ud604\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc2a4\ub808\ub4dc MATLAB \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc18\ubcf5\ub2f9 2.3\ucd08\uc758 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc2dc\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \ucd5c\uc801 \uada4\uc801\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c FALCON\uacfc IPOPT\uc758 \ucd5c\uc2e0 \ubc84\uc804 \uac04\uc758 \uc911\ub300\ud55c \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \ud638\ud658\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uc5ec, \ub77c\uadf8\ub791\uc9c0\uc548 \ud398\ub110\ud2f0 \ud56d\uc774 \ubcc0\ud568\uc5c6\uc774 0\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\uc9c0\ub418\uc5b4 \uc801\uc808\ud55c \uc81c\uc57d \uc774\ud589\uc744 \ubc29\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624 \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uba70 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \uacb0\ud568\uc774 \uc544\ub2cc \uc194\ubc84 \ud234\ubc15\uc2a4 \ud68c\uadc0\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b8\ub2e4. \ud5a5\ud6c4 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774\uc804 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \ubc84\uc804\uc73c\ub85c \ub418\ub3cc\ub824 \uc774 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uace0, \uc9c4\ud654\uc801 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud37c\uc9c0 \uba64\ubc84\uc2ed \ud568\uc218\ub97c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uba70, \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uace0\ucda9\uc2e4\ub3c4 \ube44\ud589\uae30 \ubaa8\ub378 \ubc0f \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uc7a5\uc560\ubb3c \ud658\uacbd\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ud560 \uc608\uc815\uc774\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubb34\uc778 \ud56d\uacf5\uae30\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc81c\uc57d \ucc98\ub9ac \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \ucd5c\uc801 \uc81c\uc5b4\uc640 \ud37c\uc9c0 \uaddc\uce59 \uae30\ubc18 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(FRBS)\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc7a5\uc560\ubb3c \ud68c\ud53c \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \uace0\uc804\uc801 \ucd5c\uc801 \uc81c\uc5b4\uc758 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\uc640 \uc548\uc804-critical \ud56d\uacf5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ub3d9\uae30\ubd80\uc5ec\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.

However, most existing VFL frameworks rely on the idealized assumption of full sample alignment across participants, a premise that rarely holds in real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, this work introduces Split-MoPE, a novel framework that integrates Split Learning with a specialized Mixture of Predefined Experts (MoPE) architecture. Unlike standard Mixture of Experts (MoE), where routing is learned dynamically, MoPE uses predefined experts to process specific data alignments, effectively maximizing data usage during both training and inference without requiring full sample overlap. By leveraging pretrained encoders for target data domains, Split-MoPE achieves state-of-the-art performance in a single communication round, significantly reducing the communication footprint compared to multi-round end-to-end training. Furthermore, unlike existing proposals that address sample misalignment, this novel architecture provides inherent robustness against malicious or noisy participants and offers per-sample interpretability by quantifying each collaborator's contribution to each prediction.

In contrast, self-supervised speech encoders such as WavLM provide strong acoustic representations yet remain opaque discriminative models with limited interpretability. To bridge this gap, we introduce ADEPT (Agentic Decoding of Emotion via Evidence Probing Tools), a framework that reframes emotion recognition as a multi-turn inquiry process rather than a single-pass prediction. ADEPT transforms an SLLM into an agent that maintains an evolving candidate emotion set and adaptively invokes dedicated semantic and acoustic probing tools within a structured pipeline of candidate generation, evidence collection, and adjudication. Crucially, ADEPT enables a paradigm shift from consensus learning to ambiguity-driven emotion reasoning. Since human affect exhibits inherent complexity and frequent co-occurrence of emotions, we treat minority annotations as informative perceptual signals rather than discarding them as noise.

However, existing approaches typically employ a naive autoregressive generation strategy. We identify a critical theoretical flaw in this paradigm: during inference, the model operates in an open-loop manner, consuming its own generated outputs recursively. This leads to inevitable error accumulation (exposure bias), where minor early deviations cascade into significant trajectory drift over long horizons. In this paper, we reformulate autoregressive forecasting through the lens of control theory, proposing \\textbf{F-LLM} (Feedback-driven LLM), a novel closed-loop framework. Unlike standard methods that passively propagate errors, F-LLM actively stabilizes the trajectory via a learnable residual estimator (Observer) and a feedback controller. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical guarantee that our closed-loop mechanism ensures uniformly bounded error, provided the base model satisfies a local Lipschitz constraint. Extensive experiments demonstrate that F-LLM significantly mitigates error propagation, achieving good performance on time series benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc790\uac00\ud68c\uadc0 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc804\ub7b5\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\uc810\uc744 \uc9c0\uc801\ud558\uace0, \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc774\ub860\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \ud3d0\uc1c4 \ub8e8\ud504 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 F-LLM\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0\uc11c \uc624\ub958 \uc804\ud30c\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc644\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0\uc11c \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \uc790\uac00\ud68c\uadc0 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud788 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "F-LLM\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud3d0\uc1c4 \ub8e8\ud504 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \ud559\uc2b5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc794\uc5ec \ucd94\uc815\uae30(\uc635\uc800\ubc84)\uc640 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \uc81c\uc5b4\uae30\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc548\uc815\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "F-LLM\uc740 \uc624\ub958 \uc804\ud30c\ub97c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \uc644\ud654\ud558\uba70, \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc88b\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "F-LLM\uc740 \uae30\ubcf8 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc9c0\uc5ed \ub9ac\ud504\uc2dc\uce20 \uc81c\uc57d \uc870\uac74\uc744 \ub9cc\uc871\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0, \uade0\uc77c\ud558\uac8c \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc624\ub958\ub97c \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uadfc\uac70\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc2dc\uac04 \uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubcf8\ub798\uc758 \uc5f0\uc18d\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0\uc11c \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \uc790\uac00\ud68c\uadc0 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uacb0\ud568\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4: \ucd94\ub860 \uc911\uc5d0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc5f4\ub9b0 \ub8e8\ud504 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\uc5ec \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \uc0dd\uc131 \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \uc7ac\uadc0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc18c\ube44\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ubbf8\uc138\ud55c \ucd08\uae30 \ud3b8\ucc28\uac00 \uae34 \uc218\ud3c9\uc120\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \uada4\uc801 \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud558\ub294 \ubd88\uac00\ud53c\ud55c \uc624\ub958 \ub204\uc801(\ub178\ucd9c \ud3b8\ud5a5)\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc790\uac00\ud68c\uadc0 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc774\ub860\uc758 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\uace0, \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \uae30\ubc18 LLM(F-LLM)\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud3d0\uc1c4 \ub8e8\ud504 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \uc218\ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\ud30c\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uacfc \ub2ec\ub9ac, F-LLM\uc740 \ud559\uc2b5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc794\uc5ec \ucd94\uc815\uae30(\uc635\uc800\ubc84)\uc640 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \uc81c\uc5b4\uae30\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uada4\uc801\uc744 \uc801\uadf9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc548\uc815\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud3d0\uc1c4 \ub8e8\ud504 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774 \uae30\ubcf8 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc9c0\uc5ed \ub9ac\ud504\uc2dc\uce20 \uc81c\uc57d \uc870\uac74\uc744 \ub9cc\uc871\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0 \uade0\uc77c\ud558\uac8c \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc624\ub958\ub97c \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc F-LLM\uc740 \uc624\ub958 \uc804\ud30c\ub97c \ud06c\uac8c \uc644\ud654\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba70 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Tracking how vortices move, weaken, and dissipate over time from LiDAR measurements is still difficult because scans are sparse, vortex signatures fade as the flow breaks down under atmospheric turbulence and instabilities, and point-wise annotation is prohibitively expensive. Existing approaches largely treat each scan as an independent, fully supervised segmentation problem, which overlooks temporal structure and does not scale to the vast unlabeled archives collected in practice. We present X-VORTEX, a spatio-temporal contrastive learning framework grounded in Augmentation Overlap Theory that learns physics-aware representations from unlabeled LiDAR point cloud sequences. X-VORTEX addresses two core challenges: sensor sparsity and time-varying vortex dynamics. It constructs paired inputs from the same underlying flight event by combining a weakly perturbed sequence with a strongly augmented counterpart produced via temporal subsampling and spatial masking, encouraging the model to align representations across missing frames and partial observations. Architecturally, a time-distributed geometric encoder extracts per-scan features and a sequential aggregator models the evolving vortex state across variable-length sequences. We evaluate on a real-world dataset of over one million LiDAR scans.

However, existing multi-dimensional data recovery methods leveraging FCTN decomposition still have room for further enhancement, particularly in computational efficiency and modeling capability. To address these issues, we first propose a FCTN-based generalized nonconvex regularization paradigm from the perspective of gradient mapping. Then, reliable and scalable multi-dimensional data recovery models are investigated, where the model formulation is shifted from unquantized observations to coarse-grained quantized observations. Based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework, we derive efficient optimization algorithms with convergence guarantees to solve the formulated models. To alleviate the computational bottleneck encountered when processing large-scale multi-dimensional data, fast and efficient randomized compression algorithms are devised in virtue of sketching techniques in numerical linear algebra. These dimensionality-reduction techniques serve as the computational acceleration core of our proposed algorithm framework. Theoretical results on approximation error upper bounds and convergence analysis for the proposed method are derived. Extensive numerical experiments illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed algorithm over other state-of-the-art methods in terms of quantitative metrics, visual quality, and running

However, the massive parameter scale and computational demands of LAIMs pose significant challenges for resource-limited embodied agents. To address this issue, we investigate quantization-aware collaborative inference (co-inference) for embodied AI systems. First, we develop a tractable approximation for quantization-induced inference distortion. Based on this approximation, we derive lower and upper bounds on the quantization rate-inference distortion function, characterizing its dependence on LAIM statistics, including the quantization bit-width. Next, we formulate a joint quantization bit-width and computation frequency design problem under delay and energy constraints, aiming to minimize the distortion upper bound while ensuring tightness through the corresponding lower bound. Extensive evaluations validate the proposed distortion approximation, the derived rate-distortion bounds, and the effectiveness of the proposed joint design. Particularly, simulations and real-world testbed experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed joint design in balancing inference quality, latency, and energy consumption in edge embodied AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "LAIMs\ub294 \uc784\ubca0\ub514\ub4dc AI \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec \uc9c0\ub2a5 \uc5d4\uc9c4\uc73c\ub85c \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uc778\uc2dd\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uadf8\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uc790\uc6d0 \uc81c\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc591\uc790\ud654 \uc778\uc2dd \ud611\ub825 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud568. \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc65c\uace1\uc744 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \ubc0f \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud55c \uc591\uc790\ud654 \ube44\ud2b8\ud3ed\uacfc \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc8fc\ud30c\uc218\ub97c \uacf5\ub3d9 \uc124\uacc4\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud568.", "motivation": "LAIM\uc758 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\uc640 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc694\uad6c\uc0ac\ud56d\uc774 \uc790\uc6d0 \uc81c\ud55c\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uc784\ubca0\ub514\ub4dc \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0\uac8c \ud070 \ub3c4\uc804\uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ub428.", "method": "\uc591\uc790\ud654\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uc65c\uace1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uadfc\uc0ac\uce58\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uace0, \uc65c\uace1 \uc0c1\ud55c\uc744 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc591\uc790\ud654 \ube44\ud2b8\ud3ed \ubc0f \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc8fc\ud30c\uc218\uc758 \uacf5\ub3d9 \uc124\uacc4 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc124\uc815\ud568.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc65c\uace1 \uadfc\uc0ac\uce58\uc640 \uae30\uc778\ud55c \ube44\uc728-\uc65c\uace1 \uacbd\uacc4 \ubc0f \uacf5\ub3d9 \uc124\uacc4\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\ub294 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \ud3c9\uac00\uac00 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc9d0.", "conclusion": "\ud2b9\ud788, \uc784\ubca0\ub514\ub4dc AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd94\ub860\uc758 \uc9c8, \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc2dc\uac04 \ubc0f \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc18c\ube44\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\ub294\ub370 \uc720\uc6a9\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90c.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \ubaa8\ub378(LAIM)\uc740 \uc784\ubca0\ub514\ub4dc AI \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec \uc9c0\ub2a5 \uc5d4\uc9c4\uc73c\ub85c \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uc778\uc2dd\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 LAIM\uc758 \ubc29\ub300\ud55c \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \uaddc\ubaa8\uc640 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc740 \uc790\uc6d0\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc784\ubca0\ub514\ub4dc \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ud070 \ub3c4\uc804\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc784\ubca0\ub514\ub4dc AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc591\uc790\ud654 \uc778\uc2dd \ud611\ub825 \ucd94\ub860(co-inference)\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uba3c\uc800, \uc591\uc790\ud654\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uc65c\uace1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ucc98\ub9ac \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uadfc\uc0ac\uce58\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uadfc\uc0ac\uce58\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc591\uc790\ud654 \ube44\ud2b8\ud3ed\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c LAIM \ud1b5\uacc4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \ud2b9\uc131\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc591\uc790\ud654 \ube44\uc728-\ucd94\ub860 \uc65c\uace1 \ud568\uc218\uc758 \ud558\ud55c \ubc0f \uc0c1\ud55c\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc74c\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \ubc0f \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc81c\uc57d \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uc591\uc790\ud654 \ube44\ud2b8\ud3ed \ubc0f \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc8fc\ud30c\uc218\uc758 \uacf5\ub3d9 \uc124\uacc4 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uc5ec, \ud574\ub2f9 \ud558\ud55c\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud0c0\uc774\ud2b8\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc65c\uace1 \uc0c1\ud55c\uc744 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc65c\uace1 \uadfc\uc0ac\uce58, \ub3c4\ucd9c\ub41c \ube44\uc728-\uc65c\uace1 \uacbd\uacc4 \ubc0f \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uacf5\ub3d9 \uc124\uacc4\uc758 \uc720\ud6a8\uc131\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788, \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ubc0f \uc2e4\uc81c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ubca0\ub4dc \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc740 \uc5e3\uc9c0 \uc784\ubca0\ub514\ub4dc AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd94\ub860 \ud488\uc9c8, \uc9c0\uc5f0 \ubc0f \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc18c\ube44\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\ub294\ub370 \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uacf5\ub3d9 \uc124\uacc4\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}
