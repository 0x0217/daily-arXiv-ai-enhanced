In this paper, we present a new framework for studying online non-centroid clustering with delays, where elements, that arrive one at a time as points in a finite metric space, should be assigned to clusters, but assignments need not be immediate. Specifically, upon arrival, each point's location is revealed, and an online algorithm has to irrevocably assign it to an existing cluster or create a new one containing, at this moment, only this point. However, we allow decisions to be postponed at a delay cost, instead of following the more common assumption of immediate decisions upon arrival. This poses a critical challenge: the goal is to minimize both the total distance costs between points in each cluster and the overall delay costs incurred by postponing assignments. In the classic worst-case arrival model, where points arrive in an arbitrary order, no algorithm has a competitive ratio better than sublogarithmic in the number of points. To overcome this strong impossibility, we focus on a stochastic arrival model, where points' locations are drawn independently across time from an unknown and fixed probability distribution over the finite metric space. We offer hope for beyond worst-case adversaries: we devise an algorithm that is constant competitive in the sense that, as the number of points grows, the ratio between the expected overall costs of the output clustering and an optimal offline clustering is bounded by a constant.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ube44\uc911\uc2ec

Accepted for publication at the 25th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS 2026)", "summary": "We propose average unfairness as a new measure of fairness in routing games, defined as the ratio between the average latency and the minimum latency experienced by users. This measure is a natural complement to two existing unfairness notions: loaded unfairness, which compares maximum and minimum latencies of routes with positive flow, and user equilibrium (UE) unfairness, which compares maximum latency with the latency of a Nash equilibrium. We show that the worst-case values of all three unfairness measures coincide and are characterized by a steepness parameter intrinsic to the latency function class. We show that average unfairness is always no greater than loaded unfairness, and the two measures are equal only when the flow is fully fair. Besides that, we offer a complete comparison of the three unfairness measures, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first theoretical analysis in this direction. Finally, we study the constrained system optimum (CSO) problem, where one seeks to minimize total latency subject to an upper bound on unfairness. We prove that, for the same tolerance level, the optimal flow under an average unfairness constraint achieves lower total latency than any flow satisfying a loaded unfairness constraint. We show that such improvement is always strict in parallel-link networks and establish sufficient conditions for general networks. We further illustrate the latter with numerical examples. Our results provide theoretical guarantees and valuable insights for evaluating fairness-efficiency tradeoffs in network routing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294

Existing datasets often rely on general-domain corpora or purely textual retrieval, failing to capture the complexity of specialized technical documents where information is inextricably multimodal and reasoning requires synthesizing disjoint evidence. We address this gap by introducing MiRAGE, a Multiagent framework for RAG systems Evaluation, that leverages a collaborative swarm of specialized agents to generate verified, domain-specific, multimodal, and multi-hop Question-Answer datasets. MiRAGE orchestrates a swarm of specialized agents: a recursive context optimization loop to aggregate scattered evidence, an adversarial verifier agent to guarantee factual grounding, and an agent to recognize the expert persona and the relevant domain to mimic expert cognitive workflows. Extensive empirical evaluation across four distinct domains (regulations, finance, quantitative biology, and journalism) demonstrates that MiRAGE generates datasets with significantly higher reasoning complexity (>2.3 average hops) and factual faithfulness. Our ablation studies point that MiRAGE can be powered by LLMs if textual descriptions of the images are available. Visual grounding still remains a frontier. By automating the creation of gold standard evaluation datasets that reflect the latent thematic structure of proprietary corpora, MiRAGE provides the necessary infrastructure to rigorously benchmark the next generation information retrieval systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "MiRAGE\ub294 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\uc815 \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \uc9c8\ubb38-\ub2f5\ubcc0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc815\ubcf4 \uac80\uc0c9 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud45c\uc900\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ub9d0\ubb49\uce58\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc21c\uc218\ud55c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uac80\uc0c9\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec, \uc804\ubb38 \uae30\uc220 \ubb38\uc11c\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \ubc18\uc601\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "MiRAGE\ub294 \uc804\ubb38 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud611\ub825\uc801 \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \uac80\uc99d\ub41c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\uc815 \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \uc9c8\ubb38-\ub2f5\ubcc0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "MiRAGE\ub294 \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc0c1\uc774\ud55c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778(\uaddc\uc815, \uae08\uc735, \uc815\ub7c9 \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559, \uc800\ub110\ub9ac\uc998)\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \ub192\uc740 \ucd94\ub860 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ub3c4\uc640 \uc0ac\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "MiRAGE\ub294 \uace0\uc720\ud55c \ub9d0\ubb49\uce58\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \uc8fc\uc81c \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ubc18\uc601\ud558\ub294 \ud45c\uc900 \ud3c9\uac00 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368, \ucc28\uc138\ub300 \uc815\ubcf4 \uac80\uc0c9 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud0b9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uae30\ubc18\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\uc758 \ube60\ub978 \ubc1c\uc804\uc774 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uace0\uc704\ud5d8 \uae30\uc5c5 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \uc774\ub8ec \ubc18\uba74, \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\uc815 \ud3c9\uac00 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \ub4a4\ucc98\uc838 \uc788\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ub9d0\ubb49\uce58\ub098 \uc21c\uc218\ud55c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uac80\uc0c9\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \uc804\ubb38 \uae30\uc220 \ubb38\uc11c\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \ubc18\uc601\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uba70, \uc815\ubcf4\ub294 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec\uc774\uace0 \ucd94\ub860\uc740 \ubd84\ub9ac\ub41c \uc99d\uac70\ub97c \uc885\ud569\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 MiRAGE, \uc989 RAG \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc804\ubb38 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud611\ub825\uc801 \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac80\uc99d\ub41c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\uc815 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ubc0f \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc9c8\ubb38-\ub2f5\ubcc0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.

However, most existing systems remain fragmented, specializing in either knowledge tracing, diagnostic modeling, or resource recommendation, but rarely integrating these components into a cohesive adaptive cycle. In this paper, we propose ALIGNAgent (Adaptive Learner Intelligence for Gap Identification and Next-step guidance), a multi-agent educational framework designed to deliver personalized learning through integrated knowledge estimation, skill-gap identification, and targeted resource recommendation.ALIGNAgent begins by processing student quiz performance, gradebook data, and learner preferences to generate topic-level proficiency estimates using a Skill Gap Agent that employs concept-level diagnostic reasoning to identify specific misconceptions and knowledge deficiencies. After identifying skill gaps, the Recommender Agent retrieves preference-aware learning materials aligned with diagnosed deficiencies, implementing a continuous feedback loop where interventions occur before advancing to subsequent topics. Extensive empirical evaluation on authentic datasets from two undergraduate computer science courses demonstrates ALIGNAgent's effectiveness, with GPT-4o-based agents achieving precision of 0.87-0.90 and F1 scores of 0.84-0.87 in knowledge proficiency estimation validated against actual exam performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "ALIGNAgent\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569 \uc9c0\uc2dd \ucd94\uc815, \uae30\uc220 \uac04\uadf9 \uc2dd\ubcc4 \ubc0f \ubaa9\ud45c \uc790\uc6d0 \ucd94\ucc9c\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uad50\uc721 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud559\uc0dd \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uac1c\uc778\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc5d0 \ub9de\uac8c \uad50\uc721 \ucf58\ud150\uce20, \uc9c4\ud589 \uc18d\ub3c4 \ubc0f \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c \ud559\uc2b5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131", "method": "ALIGNAgent\ub294 \ud559\uc0dd \ud034\uc988 \uc131\uc801, \uc131\uc801 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubc0f \ud559\uc2b5\uc790 \uc120\ud638\ub3c4\ub97c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\uc220 \uac04\uadf9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc8fc\uc81c \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ub2a5\uc219\ub3c4 \ucd94\uc815\uce58\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uadf8 \ud6c4 \ucd94\ucc9c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc9c4\ub2e8\ub41c \uacb0\ud54d\uc5d0 \ub9de\ub294 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc790\ub8cc\ub97c \ucd94\ucc9c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub300\ud559 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud130 \uacfc\ud559 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\uc99d \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 ALIGNAgent\ub294 \uc9c0\uc2dd \ub2a5\uc219\ub3c4 \ucd94\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c 0.87-0.90\uc758 \uc815\ubc00\ub3c4\uc640 0.84-0.87\uc758 F1 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "ALIGNAgent\ub294 \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c \ud559\uc2b5 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uc2e4\uc81c \uc2dc\ud5d8 \uc131\uacfc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uadf8 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc774 \uc785\uc99d\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac1c\uc778\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uad50\uc721 \ucf58\ud150\uce20, \uc18d\ub3c4 \ubc0f \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \uac1c\uc778\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucdb0 \uc870\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \ud559\uc0dd \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \ub4f1\uc7a5\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \uae30\uc874 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc9c0\uc2dd \ucd94\uc801, \uc9c4\ub2e8 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \ub610\ub294 \uc790\uc6d0 \ucd94\ucc9c \uc911 \ud558\ub098\uc5d0\ub9cc \ud2b9\ud654\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc751\uc9d1\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uc801\uc751 \uc8fc\uae30\ub85c \ub9cc\ub4dc\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\ub294 \ub4dc\ubb45\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569 \uc9c0\uc2dd \ucd94\uc815, \uae30\uc220 \uac04\uadf9 \uc2dd\ubcc4 \ubc0f \ubaa9\ud45c \uc790\uc6d0 \ucd94\ucc9c\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uad50\uc721 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 ALIGNAgent(Adaptive Learner Intelligence for Gap Identification and Next-step guidance)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Data sparsity, where each expert processes only a subset of tokens, offers a complementary axis. Expert-choice routing implements data sparsity directly but violates causality in autoregressive models, creating train-inference mismatch. We recover data sparsity within causal token-choice MoE by leveraging zero-compute (null) experts within the routing pool. When a token routes to null experts, those slots consume no compute. The standard load balancing objective trains the model to uniformly use all experts (real and null) therefore creating data sparsity in expectation without the causality violations. We evaluate on vision-language model training, where data heterogeneity is pronounced: vision encoders produce many low-information tokens while text tokens are denser. At matched expected FLOPs, composing weight and data sparsity yields a more compute-efficient frontier than weight sparsity alone, with gains in training loss and downstream performance. The model learns implicit modality-aware allocation, routing vision tokens to null experts more aggressively than text, without explicit modality routing.", "AI": {"tldr": "Mixture-of-Experts

Existing solutions, primarily \"Flat RAG\" architectures relying on vector databases, treat memory as an unstructured bag of embeddings. This approach fails to capture the hierarchical and temporal structure of long-horizon interactions, leading to \"Vector Haze\", the retrieval of disjointed facts lacking episodic continuity. We propose Aeon, a Neuro-Symbolic Cognitive Operating System that redefines memory not as a static store, but as a managed OS resource. Aeon structures memory into a Memory Palace (a spatial index implemented via Atlas, a SIMD-accelerated Page-Clustered Vector Index that combines small-world graph navigation with B+ Tree-style disk locality to minimize read amplification) and a Trace (a neuro-symbolic episodic graph). We introduce the Semantic Lookaside Buffer (SLB), a predictive caching mechanism that exploits conversational locality to achieve sub-millisecond retrieval latencies. Benchmarks demonstrate that Aeon achieves < 1ms retrieval latency on conversational workloads while ensuring state consistency via a zero-copy C++/Python bridge, effectively enabling persistent, structured memory for autonomous agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "Aeon\uc740 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\ub294 \uc2e0\uacbd-\uc0c1\uc9d5 \uc778\uc9c0 \uc6b4\uc601 \uccb4\uc81c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc790\uae30 \uc8fc\uc758\uc758 \uc81c\uacf1\uc758 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uacfc \ub9e5\ub77d \ucc3d\uc774 \ud655\uc7a5\ub428\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \uc800\ud558\ub418\ub294 \"\uc911\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \uc783\uc5b4\ubc84\ub9ac\uae30\" \ud604\uc0c1\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\ud55c\ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "Aeon\uc740 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\ub97c \uc815\uc801 \uc800\uc7a5\uc18c\uac00 \uc544\ub2cc \uad00\ub9ac\ub418\ub294 OS \ub9ac\uc18c\uc2a4\ub85c \uc7ac\uc815\uc758\ud558\uace0, \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\ub97c \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uad81\uc804\uacfc \uc2e0\uacbd-\uc0c1\uc9d5 \uc5d0\ud53c\uc18c\ub4dc \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub85c \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \ub300\ud654\uc758 \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc131\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud574 \uc11c\ube0c \ubc00\ub9ac\ucd08 \uac80\uc0c9 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc608\uce21 \uce90\uc2f1 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc778 SLB\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \uacb0\uacfc, Aeon\uc740 \ub300\ud654 \uc791\uc5c5 \ubd80\ud558\uc5d0\uc11c <1ms\uc758 \uac80\uc0c9 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70 \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Aeon\uc740 \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \uc790\uae30 \uc8fc\uc758\uc758 \uc81c\uacf1 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9 \ubc0f \ub9e5\ub77d \uc708\ub3c4\uc6b0\uac00 \ud655\uc7a5\ub428\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \uc800\ud558\ub418\ub294 '\uc911\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \uc783\uc5b4\ubc84\ub9ac\uae30' \ud604\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\ud55c\uc744 \ubc1b\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc740 \uc8fc\ub85c \ubca1\ud130 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ubca0\uc774\uc2a4\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294 '\ud3c9\uba74 RAG' \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub85c, \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\ub97c \ube44\uad6c\uc870\uc801\uc778 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc758 \uac00\ubc29\uc73c\ub85c \ucde8\uae09\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc7a5\uae30 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc758 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ubc0f \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\ud53c\uc18c\ub4dc \uc5f0\uc18d\uc131\uc774 \uacb0\uc5ec\ub41c \ubd88\uc5f0\uc18d\uc801 \uc0ac\uc2e4\uc744 \uac80\uc0c9\ud558\ub294 '\ubca1\ud130 \ud750\ub9bc'\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\ub97c \uc815\uc801 \uc800\uc7a5\uc18c\uac00 \uc544\ub2cc \uad00\ub9ac\ub418\ub294 OS \ub9ac\uc18c\uc2a4\ub85c \uc7ac\uc815\uc758\ud558\ub294 \uc2e0\uacbd-\uc0c1\uc9d5 \uc778\uc9c0 \uc6b4\uc601 \uccb4\uc81c\uc778 Aeon\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

The system clusters behavior windows into behavioral archetypes and uses binary confidence gating to activate archetype-based scoring only when confidence exceeds a threshold, falling back to baseline predictions when uncertain. We validate Lattice on recommendation systems (MovieLens), scientific time-series (LIGO), and financial markets, using LSTM and transformer backbones. On MovieLens with LSTM, Lattice achieves +31.9% improvement over LSTM baseline in HR@10 (p < 3.29 x 10^-25, 30 seeds), outperforming transformer baselines by 109.4% over SASRec and 218.6% over BERT4Rec. On LIGO and financial data, the system correctly refuses archetype activation when distribution shift occurs - a successful outcome demonstrating confidence gating prevents false activation. On transformer backbones, Lattice provides 0.0% improvement (neutral, no degradation), gracefully deferring when structure is already present. This bidirectional validation - activating when patterns apply, refusing when they don't, and deferring when redundant - supports confidence gating as a promising architectural principle for managing epistemic uncertainty in safety-critical applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Lattice\ub294 \uc774\uc9c4 \uc2e0\ub8b0 \uac8c\uc774\ud305\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \ud589\ub3d9 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uc870\uac74\ubd80\ub85c \ud65c\uc131\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc21c\ucc28 \uc608\uce21 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc548\uc804\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uc9c0 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \uc6d0\uce59\uc73c\ub85c \uc2e0\ub8b0 \uac8c\uc774\ud305\uc744 \uc9c0\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "\ud589\ub3d9 \uc708\ub3c4\uc6b0\ub97c \ud589\ub3d9 \uc804\ud615\uc73c\ub85c \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130\ub9c1\ud558\uace0, \uc2e0\ub8b0\uac00 \uc784\uacc4\uac12\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud560 \ub54c\ub9cc \uc810\uc218\ub97c \ud65c\uc131\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc774\uc9c4 \uc2e0\ub8b0 \uac8c\uc774\ud305\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "Lattice\ub294 \ucd94\ucc9c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(MovieLens)\uc5d0\uc11c HR@10\uc5d0\uc11c LSTM \uae30\uc900\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 +31.9% \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, transformer \uae30\uc900\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 SASRec\uc5d0\uc11c 109.4%, BERT4Rec\uc5d0\uc11c 218.6% \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Lattice\ub294 \ud328\ud134\uc774 \uc801\uc6a9\ub420 \ub54c \ud65c\uc131\ud654\ud558\uace0, \uadf8\ub807\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc744 \ub54c \uac70\ubd80\ud558\uba70, \uc911\ubcf5\ub420 \ub54c \uc5f0\uae30\ud558\ub294 \uc591\ubc29\ud5a5 \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2e0\ub8b0 \uac8c\uc774\ud305\uc758 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\uc9c4 \uc2e0\ub8b0 \uac8c\uc774\ud305\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \ud589\ub3d9 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uc870\uac74\ubd80\ub85c \ud65c\uc131\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc21c\ucc28 \uc608\uce21 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc778 Lattice\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc708\ub3c4\uc6b0\ub97c \ud589\ub3d9 \uc804\ud615\uc73c\ub85c \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130\ub9c1\ud558\uace0 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uac00 \uc784\uacc4\uac12\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud560 \ub54c\ub9cc \uc804\ud615 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \ud65c\uc131\ud654\ud558\uba70, \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud560 \uacbd\uc6b0 \uae30\ubcf8 \uc608\uce21\uc73c\ub85c \ub418\ub3cc\uc544\uac04\ub2e4.

This paper introduces the Determinism-Faithfulness Assurance Harness (DFAH), a framework for measuring trajectory determinism and evidence-conditioned faithfulness in tool-using agents deployed in financial services.\n  Across 74 configurations (12 models, 4 providers, 8-24 runs each at T=0.0) in non-agentic baseline experiments, 7-20B parameter models achieved 100% determinism, while 120B+ models required 3.7x larger validation samples to achieve equivalent statistical reliability. Agentic tool-use introduces additional variance (see Tables 4-7). Contrary to the assumed reliability-capability trade-off, a positive Pearson correlation emerged (r = 0.45, p < 0.01, n = 51 at T=0.0) between determinism and faithfulness; models producing consistent outputs also tended to be more evidence-aligned.\n  Three financial benchmarks are provided (compliance triage, portfolio constraints, DataOps exceptions; 50 cases each) along with an open-source stress-test harness. In these benchmarks and under DFAH evaluation settings, Tier 1 models with schema-first architectures achieved determinism levels consistent with audit replay requirements.", "AI": {"tldr": "DFAH\ub294 \uae08\uc735 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \ub0b4 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uada4\uc801 \uacb0\uc815\uc131\uacfc \uc99d\uac70 \uae30\ubc18 \ucda9\uc2e4\ub3c4\ub97c \uce21\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \ube44\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, 7-20B \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 100% \uacb0\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc73c\uba70, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc740 \ucd94\uac00 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud588\ub2e4. \uacb0\uc815\uc131\uacfc \ucda9\uc2e4\ub3c4 \uc0ac\uc774\uc5d0 \uae0d\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4\uac00 \ubc1c\uacac\ub418\uc5c8\uace0, Tier 1 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uac10\uc0ac \uc7ac\uc0dd \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc5d0 \ubd80\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uacb0\uc815\uc131 \uc218\uc900\uc5d0 \ub3c4\ub2ec\ud588\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uaddc\uc81c \uac10\uc0ac \uc7ac\uc0dd\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \uc785\ub825\uc73c\ub85c \ud50c\ub798\uadf8\uac00 \uc9c0\uc815\ub41c \uac70\ub798 \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc7ac\ud604\ud560 \ub54c \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubc18\ud658\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "\uacb0\uc815\uc131 \ubc0f \uc99d\uac70 \uae30\ubc18 \ucda9\uc2e4\ub3c4\ub97c \uce21\uc815\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 \uacb0\uc815\uc131-\ucda9\uc2e4\ub3c4 \ubcf4\uc7a5 \ud558\ub124\uc2a4(DFAH)\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc600\uace0, \ube44\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uacfc \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc758 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud588\ub2e4.", "result": "74\uac1c\uc758 \uad6c\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c 7-20B \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 100% \uacb0\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c \ubc18\uba74, 120B \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ub3d9\ub4f1\ud55c \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 3.7\ubc30 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc740 \uac80\uc99d \uc0d8\ud50c\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud588\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uacb0\uc815\uc131\uacfc \ucda9\uc2e4\ub3c4 \uc0ac\uc774\uc5d0 \uae0d\uc815\uc801\uc778 \ud53c\uc5b4\uc2a8 \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4\uac00 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Tier 1 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 DFAH \ud3c9\uac00 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uac10\uc0ac \uc7ac\uc0dd \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc5d0 \uc77c\uce58\ud558\ub294 \uacb0\uc815\uc131 \uc218\uc900\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uaddc\uc81c \uac10\uc0ac \uc7ac\uc0dd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \uc785\ub825\uc73c\ub85c \ud50c\ub798\uadf8\uac00 \uc9c0\uc815\ub41c \uac70\ub798 \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc7ac\ud604\ud558\ub77c\ub294 \uc694\uccad\uc744 \ubc1b\uc558\uc744 \ub54c \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \ubc30\ud3ec\uac00 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubc18\ud658\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uae08\uc735 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc5d0 \ubc30\uce58\ub41c \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uada4\uc801 \uacb0\uc815\uc131\uacfc \uc99d\uac70 \uae30\ubc18 \ucda9\uc2e4\ub3c4\ub97c \uce21\uc815\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 \uacb0\uc815\uc131-\ucda9\uc2e4\ub3c4 \ubcf4\uc7a5 \ud558\ub124\uc2a4(DFAH)\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ube44\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ucd08 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c 74\uac1c\uc758 \uad6c\uc131(12\uac1c \ubaa8\ub378, 4\uac1c \uc81c\uacf5\uc5c5\uccb4, \uac01 T=0.0\uc5d0\uc11c 8-24\ubc88 \uc2e4\ud589) \uc911 7-20B \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 100% \uacb0\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc73c\uba70, 120B \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ub3d9\ub4f1\ud55c \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 3.7\ubc30 \ub354 \ud070 \uac80\uc99d \uc0d8\ud50c\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc740 \ucd94\uac00\uc801\uc778 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4(\ud45c 4-7 \ucc38\uc870). \uac00\uc815\ub41c \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131-\ub2a5\ub825 \uac70\ub798\uc640 \ubc18\ub300\ub85c, \uacb0\uc815\uc131\uacfc \ucda9\uc2e4\ub3c4 \uac04\uc5d0 \uae0d\uc815\uc801\uc778 \ud53c\uc5b4\uc2a8 \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4(r = 0.45, p < 0.01, n = 51 at T=0.0)\uac00 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4;

However, due to the invasive nature of biomarker collection, most AD diagnoses are made in memory clinics using cognitive tests and evaluation of hippocampal atrophy based on MRI. While clinical assessment and hippocampal volume show high diagnostic accuracy for amnestic or typical AD (tAD), a substantial subgroup of AD patients with atypical presentation (atAD) are routinely misdiagnosed. To improve diagnosis of atAD patients, we propose a machine learning approach to distinguish between atAD and non-AD cognitive impairment using clinical testing battery and MRI data collected as standard-of-care. We develop and evaluate our approach using 1410 subjects across four groups (273 tAD, 184 atAD, 235 non-AD, and 685 cognitively normal) collected from one private data set and two public data sets from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We perform multiple atAD vs. non-AD classification experiments using clinical features and hippocampal volume as well as a comprehensive set of MRI features from across the brain. The best performance is achieved by incorporating additional important MRI features, which outperforms using hippocampal volume alone. Furthermore, we use the Boruta statistical approach to identify and visualize significant brain regions distinguishing between diagnostic groups. Our ML approach improves the percentage of correctly diagnosed atAD cases (the recall) from 52% to 69% for NACC and from 34% to 77% for ADNI, while achieving high precision. The proposed approach has important implications for improving diagnostic accuracy for non-amnestic atAD in clinical settings using only clinical testing battery and MRI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774

We study a perishable inventory system with random lead times in which both the demand process and the lead time distribution are unknown. We consider a practical setting where orders are placed using limited historical data together with observed covariates and current system states. To improve learning efficiency under limited data, we adopt a marginal cost accounting scheme that assigns each order a single lifetime cost and yields a unified loss function for end-to-end learning. This enables training a deep learning-based policy that maps observed covariates and system states directly to order quantities. We develop two end-to-end variants: a purely black-box approach that outputs order quantities directly (E2E-BB), and a structure-guided approach that embeds the projected inventory level (PIL) policy, capturing inventory effects through explicit computation rather than additional learning (E2E-PIL). We further show that the objective induced by E2E-PIL is homogeneous of degree one, enabling a boosting technique from operational data analytics (ODA) that yields an enhanced policy (E2E-BPIL). Experiments on synthetic and real data establish a robust performance ordering: E2E-BB is dominated by E2E-PIL, which is further improved by E2E-BPIL. Using an excess-risk decomposition, we show that embedding heuristic policy structure reduces effective model complexity and improves learning efficiency with only a modest loss of flexibility. More broadly, our results suggest that deep learning-based decision tools are more effective and robust when guided by human knowledge, highlighting the value of integrating advanced analytics with inventory theory.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud55c \uc218\uc694\uc640 \ub9ac\ub4dc \ud0c0\uc784\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \ubd80\ud328\uc131 \uc7ac\uace0

Although recent large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning capabilities, their single-agent architectures often struggle with heterogeneous, domain-specific crash data and tend to generate biased or unstable predictions. To address these limitations, this paper proposes TransportAgents, a hybrid multi-agent framework that integrates category-specific LLM reasoning with a multilayer perceptron (MLP) integration module. Each specialized agent focuses on a particular subset of traffic information, such as demographics, environmental context, or incident details, to produce intermediate severity assessments that are subsequently fused into a unified prediction. Extensive experiments on two complementary U.S. datasets, the Consumer Product Safety Risk Management System (CPSRMS) and the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS), demonstrate that TransportAgents consistently outperforms both traditional machine learning and advanced LLM-based baselines. Across three representative backbones, including closed-source models such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o, as well as open-source models such as LLaMA-3.3, the framework exhibits strong robustness, scalability, and cross-dataset generalizability. A supplementary distributional analysis further shows that TransportAgents produces more balanced and well-calibrated severity predictions than standard single-agent LLM approaches, highlighting its interpretability and reliability for safety-critical decision support applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uad50\ud1b5 \uc0ac\uace0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc0ac\uace0 \uc2ec\uac01\ub3c4\ub97c \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 TransportAgents\ub77c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \uae30\uc874 \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uad50\ud1b5 \uc0ac\uace0\uc758 \uc2ec\uac01\ub3c4\ub97c \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uae34\uae09 \ub300\uc751 \ubc0f \uacf5\uacf5 \uc548\uc804 \uacc4\ud68d \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "TransportAgents\ub294 \uce74\ud14c\uace0\ub9ac\ubcc4 LLM \ucd94\ub860\uacfc \ub2e4\uce35 \ud37c\uc149\ud2b8\ub860(MLP) \ud1b5\ud569 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac01 \uc804\ubb38 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc778\uad6c\ud1b5\uacc4, \ud658\uacbd \ub9e5\ub77d \ub610\ub294 \uc0ac\uac74 \uc138\ubd80\uc815\ubcf4\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ud2b9\uc815 \uad50\ud1b5 \uc815\ubcf4\uc758 \ud558\uc704 \uc9d1\ud569\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\ud558\uc5ec \uc911\uac04 \uc2ec\uac01\ub3c4 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ubbf8\uad6d\uc758 \ub450 \uc0c1\ud638 \ubcf4\uc644 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8(CPSRMS \ubc0f NEISS)\uc5d0\uc11c TransportAgents\uac00 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc0f LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uae30\uc900\uc120\ubcf4\ub2e4 consistently \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc784\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "TransportAgents\ub294 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uacfc \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70, \uc548\uc804 \uc804\ub2f4 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uc9c0\uc6d0 \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc5d0 \uc801\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uad50\ud1b5 \uc0ac\uace0 \uc2ec\uac01\ub3c4\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc608\uce21\uc740 \uae34\uae09 \ub300\uc751 \ubc0f \uacf5\uacf5 \uc548\uc804 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc\uc758 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub294 \uc885\uc885 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc0ac\uace0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uc73c\uba70 \ud3b8\ud5a5\ub418\uac70\ub098 \ubd88\uc548\uc815\ud55c \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc81c\ud55c\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uce74\ud14c\uace0\ub9ac \ud2b9\uc815 LLM \ucd94\ub860\uacfc \ub2e4\uce35 \ud37c\uc149\ud2b8\ub860(MLP) \ud1b5\ud569 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 TransportAgents\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac01 \uc804\ubb38 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc778\uad6c\ud1b5\uacc4, \ud658\uacbd \ub9e5\ub77d \ub610\ub294 \uc0ac\uac74 \uc138\ubd80\uc815\ubcf4\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ud2b9\uc815 \uad50\ud1b5 \uc815\ubcf4\uc758 \ud558\uc704 \uc9d1\ud569\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uc5b4 \uc911\uac04 \uc2ec\uac01\ub3c4 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ub41c \uc608\uce21\uc73c\ub85c \uc735\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

An agent aims to determine whether there exists a qualified arm whose mean reward is not less than a known threshold $\u03bc_0$, or to output \\textsf{None} if it believes such an arm does not exist. The agent needs to guarantee its output is correct with probability at least $1-\u03b4$, while making expected total pulling times $\\mathbb{E}\u03c4$ as small as possible. We work on 1-identification with two main contributions. (1) We utilize an optimization formulation to derive a new lower bound of $\\mathbb{E}\u03c4$, when there is at least one qualified arm. (2) We design a new algorithm, deriving tight upper bounds whose gap to lower bounds are up to a polynomial of logarithm factor across all problem instance.

Current world models, however, suffer from visual conflation: the mistaken assumption that high-fidelity video generation implies an understanding of physical and causal dynamics. We show that while modern models excel at predicting pixels, they frequently violate invariant constraints, fail under intervention, and break down in safety-critical decision-making. This survey argues that visual realism is an unreliable proxy for world understanding. Instead, effective world models must encode causal structure, respect domain-specific constraints, and remain stable over long horizons. We propose a reframing of world models as actionable simulators rather than visual engines, emphasizing structured 4D interfaces, constraint-aware dynamics, and closed-loop evaluation. Using medical decision-making as an epistemic stress test, where trial-and-error is impossible and errors are irreversible, we demonstrate that a world model's value is determined not by how realistic its rollouts appear, but by its ability to support counterfactual reasoning, intervention planning, and robust long-horizon foresight.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ud658\uacbd\uc758 \uc9c4\ud654\ub97c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud558\uc5ec \uc0ac\uace0\ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud604\uc7ac \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \uc735\ud569 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \ud658\uacbd\uc758 \uc9c4\ud654\ub97c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud558\uc5ec \ubbf8\ub798\ub97c \uacc4\ud68d\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \uc5d4\uc9c4\uc774 \uc544\ub2cc \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\ud130\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uad6c\uc870\uc801 4D \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\uc640 \uc81c\uc57d \uc778\uc9c0 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ucd5c\uc2e0 \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uc740 \ud53d\uc140 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0\uc11c \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub098\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubd88\ubcc0 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \uc704\ubc18\ud558\uace0 \uc548\uc804-critical \uacb0\uc815-making\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\ud328\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uac00\uce58\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \ub864\uc544\uc6c3\uc758 \ud604\uc2e4\uc131\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ubc18\uc0ac\uc2e4\uc801 \ucd94\ub860, \uac1c\uc785 \uacc4\ud68d \ubc0f \uac15\uac74\ud55c \uc7a5\uae30 \uc608\uce21 \ub2a5\ub825\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uacb0\uc815\ub41c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ud658\uacbd\uc774 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc9c4\ud654\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud558\ub294 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc73c\ub85c, \ubc18\uc751\uc801 \uc778\uc2dd\uc774 \uc544\ub2cc \uc0c1\uc0c1\ub41c \ubbf8\ub798\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uacc4\ud68d\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud574\uc900\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uace0\ud574\uc0c1\ub3c4 \ube44\ub514\uc624 \uc0dd\uc131\uc774 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \ubc0f \uc778\uacfc\uc801 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc774\ud574\ub97c \uc758\ubbf8\ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \uc798\ubabb \uac00\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \uc735\ud569\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud604\ub300 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud53d\uc140 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub098\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubd88\ubcc0 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \uc790\uc8fc \uc704\ubc18\ud558\uace0, \uac1c\uc785\uc5d0 \uc2e4\ud328\ud558\uba70, \uc548\uc804-critical \uacb0\uc815-making\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd84\ud574\ub41c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc870\uc0ac\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \ud604\uc2e4\uac10\uc774 \uc138\uacc4 \uc774\ud574\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \ub300\ub9ac \uc9c0\ud45c\ub77c\uace0 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub300\uc2e0, \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc778\uacfc \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ud558\uace0, \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\uc218 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \uc874\uc911\ud558\uba70, \uc7a5\uae30\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c 4D \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4, \uc81c\uc57d \uc778\uc9c0 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559 \ubc0f \ud3d0\uc1c4 \ub8e8\ud504 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uac15\uc870\ud558\ub294 \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\ud130\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\uc790\ub294 \uc81c\uc548\uc744 \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc758\ub8cc \uacb0\uc815-making\uc744 \uc778\uc2dd\uc801 \uc2a4\ud2b8\ub808\uc2a4 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \uc2dc\ud589\ucc29\uc624\uac00 \ubd88\uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uc624\ub958\uac00 \ub418\ub3cc\ub9b4 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uac00\uce58\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \ub864\uc544\uc6c3\uc758 \uc678\ud615\uc774 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ubcf4\uc774\ub294\uac00\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uacb0\uc815\ub418\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \ubc18\uc0ac\uc2e4\uc801 \ucd94\ub860, \uac1c\uc785 \uacc4\ud68d \ubc0f \uac15\uac74\ud55c \uc7a5\uae30\uc801 \uc608\uce21 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uacb0\uc815\ub41c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4."}}

This brittleness hinders reliable real-world deployment, where the execution errors are inherently inevitable during tool interaction procedures. We identify a key limitation of current approaches: standard reinforcement learning (RL) treats errors as sparse negative rewards, providing no guidance on how to recover, while pre-collected synthetic error-correction datasets suffer from distribution mismatch with the model's on-policy error modes. To bridge this gap, we propose Fission-GRPO, a framework that converts execution errors into corrective supervision within the RL training loop. Our core mechanism fissions each failed trajectory into a new training instance by augmenting it with diagnostic feedback from a finetuned Error Simulator, then resampling recovery rollouts on-policy. This enables the model to learn from the precise errors it makes during exploration, rather than from static, pre-collected error cases. On the BFCL v4 Multi-Turn, Fission-GRPO improves the error recovery rate of Qwen3-8B by 5.7% absolute, crucially, yielding a 4% overall accuracy gain (42.75% to 46.75%) over GRPO and outperforming

Achieving near-optimal kernels requires expert-level understanding of hardware architectures and programming models, making kernel engineering a critical but notoriously time-consuming and non-scalable process. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and LLM-based agents have opened new possibilities for automating kernel generation and optimization. LLMs are well-suited to compress expert-level kernel knowledge that is difficult to formalize, while agentic systems further enable scalable optimization by casting kernel development as an iterative, feedback-driven loop. Rapid progress has been made in this area. However, the field remains fragmented, lacking a systematic perspective for LLM-driven kernel generation. This survey addresses this gap by providing a structured overview of existing approaches, spanning LLM-based approaches and agentic optimization workflows, and systematically compiling the datasets and benchmarks that underpin learning and evaluation in this domain. Moreover, key open challenges and future research directions are further outlined, aiming to establish a comprehensive reference for the next generation of automated kernel optimization.

Meanwhile large language models (LLMs) excel at interpreting natural language and unstructured data but lack deterministic, verifiable execution of complex business logic. To address this gap, here we introduce AUTOBUS, an Autonomous Business System that integrates LLM-based AI agents, predicate-logic programming, and business-semantics-centric enterprise data into a coherent neuro-symbolic AI architecture for orchestrating end-to-end business initiatives. AUTOBUS models an initiative as a network of tasks with explicit pre/post conditions, required data, evaluation rules, and API-level actions. Enterprise data is organized as a knowledge graph whose entities, relationships, and constraints are translated into logic facts and foundational rules, providing the semantic grounding for task reasoning. Core AI agents synthesize task instructions, enterprise semantics, and available tools into task-specific logic programs, which are executed by a logic engine that enforces constraints, coordinates auxiliary tools, and orchestrate execution of actions and outcomes. Humans define and maintain the semantics, policies and task instructions, curate tools, and supervise high-impact or ambiguous decisions, ensuring accountability and adaptability. We detail the AUTOBUS architecture, the anatomy of the AI agent generated logic programs, and the role of humans and auxiliary tools in the lifecycle of a business initiative.", "AI": {"tldr": "AUTOBUS\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \ube44\uc988\ub2c8\uc2a4 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc911\uc2ec \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \uc790\uc728 \ube44\uc988\ub2c8\uc2a4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc870\uc9c1\ub4e4\uc774 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad50\ucc28 \uae30\ub2a5 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294 \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ube44\uc988\ub2c8\uc2a4 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uae30\uc5c5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uace0\ub9bd\ub41c \ubd80\uc11c\uc640 \uacbd\uc9c1\ub41c \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "AUTOBUS\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8, \uc220\uc5b4 \ub17c\ub9ac \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d, \ube44\uc988\ub2c8\uc2a4 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \uae30\uc5c5 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud574 \ube44\uc988\ub2c8\uc2a4 \uc774\ub2c8\uc154\ud2f0\ube0c\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \uc2e0\uacbd \uae30\ud638 AI \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "AUTOBUS\ub294 \uc774\ub2c8\uc154\ud2f0\ube0c\ub97c \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uace0, \uad00\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc870\uc9c1\ud558\uc5ec \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc0ac\uc2e4\uacfc \uae30\ucd08 \uaddc\uce59\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\uc5ec \uc791\uc5c5 \ucd94\ub860\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \uae30\ubc18\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc778\uac04\uc740 \uc758\ubbf8, \uc815\ucc45 \ubc0f \uc791\uc5c5 \uc9c0\uce68\uc744 \uc815\uc758\ud558\uace0 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba70, \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \ud050\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud558\uace0, \uace0\ucda9\uaca9 \ub610\ub294 \ubaa8\ud638\ud55c \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uac10\ub3c5\ud558\uc5ec \ucc45\uc784\uc131\uacfc \uc801\uc751\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ube44\uc988\ub2c8\uc2a4 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc870\uc9c1\ub4e4\uc774 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad50\ucc28 \uae30\ub2a5 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud574\uc57c \ud558\uba70, \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uae30\uc5c5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uace0\ub9bd\ub41c \ubd80\uc11c\uc640 \uacbd\uc9c1\ub41c \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \ud558\ub4dc \ucf54\ub529\ub41c \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\ub2e4. \ud070 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc740 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4\uc640 \ube44\uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud574\uc11d\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub098\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ube44\uc988\ub2c8\uc2a4 \ub17c\ub9ac\ub97c \uacb0\uc815\ub860\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc2e4\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ub370\ub294 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4. \uc774 \uac04\uadf9\uc744 \ud574\uc18c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8, \uc220\uc5b4-\ub17c\ub9ac \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d, \ube44\uc988\ub2c8\uc2a4 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \uae30\uc5c5 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \uc790\uc728 \ube44\uc988\ub2c8\uc2a4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc778 AUTOBUS\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.

This reveals limited understanding of components governing safety. Existing methods rely on local, greedy attribution that assumes independent component contributions. However, they overlook the cooperative interactions between different components in LLMs, such as attention heads, which jointly contribute to safety mechanisms. We propose \\textbf{G}lobal \\textbf{O}ptimization for \\textbf{S}afety \\textbf{V}ector Extraction (GOSV), a framework that identifies safety-critical attention heads through global optimization over all heads simultaneously. We employ two complementary activation repatching strategies: Harmful Patching and Zero Ablation. These strategies identify two spatially distinct sets of safety vectors with consistently low overlap, termed Malicious Injection Vectors and Safety Suppression Vectors, demonstrating that aligned LLMs maintain separate functional pathways for safety purposes. Through systematic analyses, we find that complete safety breakdown occurs when approximately 30\\% of total heads are repatched across all models. Building on these insights, we develop a novel inference-time white-box jailbreak method that exploits the identified safety vectors through activation repatching. Our attack substantially outperforms existing white-box attacks across all test models, providing strong evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed GOSV framework on LLM safety interpretability.",

As these capabilities diffuse across departments and vendors, health systems face agent sprawl, causing duplicated agents, unclear accountability, inconsistent controls, and tool permissions that persist beyond the original use case. Existing AI governance frameworks emphasize lifecycle risk management but provide limited guidance for the day-to-day operations of agent fleets. We propose a Unified Agent Lifecycle Management (UALM) blueprint derived from a rapid, practice-oriented synthesis of governance standards, agent security literature, and healthcare compliance requirements. UALM maps recurring gaps onto five control-plane layers: (1) an identity and persona registry, (2) orchestration and cross-domain mediation, (3) PHI-bounded context and memory, (4) runtime policy enforcement with kill-switch triggers, and (5) lifecycle management and decommissioning linked to credential revocation and audit logging. A companion maturity model supports staged adoption. UALM offers healthcare CIOs, CISOs, and clinical leaders an implementable pattern for audit-ready oversight that preserves local innovation and enables safer scaling across clinical and administrative domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc758\ub8cc \uc870\uc9c1\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 AI\uc758 \ud1b5\ud569\uacfc \uc774\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc0dd\uc560 \uc8fc\uae30 \uad00\ub9ac(UALM) \uccad\uc0ac\uc9c4\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc758\ub8cc \uc870\uc9c1\ub4e4\uc774 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 AI\ub97c \uc784\uc0c1 \ubb38\uc11c \uc9c0\uc6d0 \ubc0f \uc870\uae30 \uacbd\uace0 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1 \ub4f1 \uc77c\uc0c1 \uc5c5\ubb34\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uae30 \uc2dc\uc791\ud558\uba74\uc11c, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud655\uc0b0 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc911\ubcf5\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8, \ubd88\uba85\ud655\ud55c \ucc45\uc784, \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ud1b5\uc81c \ubc0f \ud234 \uad8c\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "UALM\uc740 \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4 \uae30\uc900, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubcf4\uc548 \ubb38\ud5cc \ubc0f \uc758\ub8cc \ucef4\ud50c\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\uc2a4 \uc694\uad6c\uc0ac\ud56d\uc758 \uc2e0\uc18d\ud558\uace0 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc9c0\ud5a5\uc801\uc778 \uc885\ud569\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uccad\uc0ac\uc9c4\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ub2e4\uc12f \uac1c\uc758 \uc81c\uc5b4Plane \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\uc5d0 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub098\ub294 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ub9e4\ud551\ud55c\ub2e4: (1) \uc544\uc774\ub374\ud2f0\ud2f0 \ubc0f \ud398\ub974\uc18c\ub098 \ub808\uc9c0\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9ac, (2) \uc624\ucf00\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ubc0f \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uac04 \uc911\uc7ac, (3) PHI(\uac1c\uc778 \uac74\uac15 \uc815\ubcf4) \uae30\ubc18 \ub9e5\ub77d \ubc0f \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac, (4) \ub7f0\ud0c0\uc784 \uc815\ucc45 \uc2dc\ud589\uacfc \ud0ac \uc2a4\uc704\uce58 \ud2b8\ub9ac\uac70, (5) \uc790\uaca9 \ucde8\uc18c \ubc0f \uac10\uc0ac \ub85c\uae45\uacfc \uc5f0\uacb0\ub41c \uc0dd\uc560 \uc8fc\uae30 \uad00\ub9ac \ubc0f \ud3d0\uae30.", "result": "UALM\uc740 \uc758\ub8cc CIO, CISO \ubc0f \uc784\uc0c1 \ub9ac\ub354\ub4e4\uc5d0\uac8c \ub85c\uceec \ud601\uc2e0\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc784\uc0c1 \ubc0f \uad00\ub9ac \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uac10\uc0ac \uc900\ube44 \uac10\ub3c5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uad6c\ud604 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud328\ud134\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "UALM\uc740 \uc758\ub8cc \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 AI\uc758 \ud1b5\ud569\uacfc \uad00\ub9ac\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc758\ub8cc \uc870\uc9c1\ub4e4\uc774 \uc784\uc0c1 \ubb38\uc11c \uc9c0\uc6d0 \ubc0f \uc870\uae30 \uacbd\uace0 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uc77c\uc0c1 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801 AI\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uae30 \uc2dc\uc791\ud558\uba74\uc11c, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub2a5\ub825\ub4e4\uc774 \ubd80\uc11c\uc640 \uacf5\uae09\uc790\ub97c \ub118\uc5b4 \ud655\uc0b0\ub428\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uac74\uac15 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubc94\ub78c\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc911\ubcf5\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8, \ubd88\ubd84\uba85\ud55c \ucc45\uc784, \uc77c\uad00\uc131 \uc5c6\ub294 \ud1b5\uc81c \ubc0f \uc6d0\ub798 \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uc0ac\ub840\ub97c \ub118\uc5b4 \uc9c0\uc18d\ub418\ub294 \ub3c4\uad6c \uad8c\ud55c\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 AI \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc0dd\uc560 \uc8fc\uae30 \uc704\ud5d8 \uad00\ub9ac\uc5d0 \uc911\uc810\uc744 \ub450\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud568\ub300\uc758 \uc77c\uc0c1 \uc6b4\uc601\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc9c0\uce68\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4 \uae30\uc900, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubcf4\uc548 \ubb38\ud5cc \ubc0f \uc758\ub8cc \ucef4\ud50c\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\uc2a4 \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc758 \uc2e0\uc18d\ud558\uace0 \uc2e4\ucc9c \uc9c0\ud5a5\uc801\uc778 \uc885\ud569\uc5d0\uc11c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ub41c \ud1b5\ud569 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc0dd\uc560 \uc8fc\uae30 \uad00\ub9ac(UALM) \uccad\uc0ac\uc9c4\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

However, the limited availability of such data poses challenges for developing robust deep learning models. In this work, we present the first framework for generating dark-field images directly from standard attenuation chest X-rays using an Uncertainty-Guided Progressive Generative Adversarial Network. The model incorporates both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty to improve interpretability and reliability. Experiments demonstrate high structural fidelity of the generated images, with consistent improvement of quantitative metrics across stages.

Yet agent testing remains nascent and is still a developing science. As AI agents begin to be deployed globally, it is important that they handle different languages and cultures accurately and securely.\n  To address this, participants from The International Network for Advanced AI Measurement, Evaluation and Science, including representatives from Singapore, Japan, Australia, Canada, the European Commission, France, Kenya, South Korea, and the United Kingdom have come together to align approaches to agentic evaluations.\n  This is the third exercise, building on insights from two earlier joint testing exercises conducted by the Network in November 2024 and February 2025. The objective is to further refine best practices for testing advanced AI systems.\n  The exercise was split into two strands: (1) common risks, including leakage of sensitive information and fraud, led by Singapore AISI; and (2) cybersecurity, led by UK AISI. A mix of open and closed-weight models were evaluated against tasks from various public agentic benchmarks. Given the nascency of agentic testing, our primary focus was on understanding methodological issues in conducting such tests, rather than examining test results or model capabilities. This collaboration marks an important step forward as participants work together to advance the science of agentic evaluations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc790\uc728 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uae09\uc18d\ud55c \uc0c1\uc2b9\uacfc \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ub2a5\ub825\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc774 \uc2e4\uc138\uacc4 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac10\ub3c5 \uac10\uc18c\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub9ac\uc2a4\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub294 \ucd08\uae30 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ub2e4\uad6d\uc801 \ubc30\ud3ec\ub420 \ub54c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc5b8\uc5b4\uc640 \ubb38\ud654\ub97c \uc815\ud655\ud558\uace0 \uc548\uc804\ud558\uac8c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc790\uc728 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc99d\uac00\uc640 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804 \ud544\uc694\uc131", "method": "\uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uad6d\uc81c \ud611\ub825 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uc5ec \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uc704\ud5d8\uacfc \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548\uc744 \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud750\ub984\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ub258\uc5b4 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\uac00 \uc9c4\ud589\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uacf5\uac1c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\uc900\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uacb0\uacfc \ub17c\uc758 \ubc0f \ubc29\ubc95\ub860 \uc774\uc288\uc758 \uc774\ud574", "conclusion": "\ucc38\uac00\uc790\ub4e4\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud3c9\uac00 \uacfc\ud559\uc744 \ubc1c\uc804\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud611\ub825\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc790\uc728 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uae09\uc18d\ud55c \uc0c1\uc2b9\uacfc \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ub2a5\ub825\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc774 \uc2e4\uc138\uacc4 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac10\ub3c5 \uac10\uc18c\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub9ac\uc2a4\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub294 \uc544\uc9c1 \ucd08\uae30 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70 \uac1c\ubc1c \uc911\uc778 \uacfc\ud559\uc774\ub2e4.

We analyze this spectrum in Smoothed Online Convex Optimization (SOCO), where the learner incurs both hitting and movement costs. Our main contribution is establishing that laziness is possible without sacrificing hitting performance: we prove that $k$-lazyGD achieves the optimal dynamic regret $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{(P_T+1)T})$ for any laziness slack $k$ up to $\u0398(\\sqrt{T/P_T})$, where $P_T$ is the comparator path length. This result formally connects the allowable laziness to the comparator's shifts, showing that $k$-lazyGD can retain the inherently small movements of lazy methods without compromising tracking ability. We base our analysis on the Follow the Regularized Leader (FTRL) framework, and derive a matching lower bound.

Existing methods face a dilemma: uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods typically act as passive sensors, only diagnosing risks without addressing them, while self-reflection mechanisms suffer from continuous or aimless corrections. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified Dual-Process Agentic UQ (AUQ) framework that transforms verbalized uncertainty into active, bi-directional control signals. Our architecture comprises two complementary mechanisms: System 1 (Uncertainty-Aware Memory, UAM), which implicitly propagates verbalized confidence and semantic explanations to prevent blind decision-making; and System 2 (Uncertainty-Aware Reflection, UAR), which utilizes these explanations as rational cues to trigger targeted inference-time resolution only when necessary. This enables the agent to balance efficient execution and deep deliberation dynamically. Extensive experiments on closed-loop benchmarks and open-ended deep research tasks demonstrate that our training-free approach achieves superior performance and trajectory-level calibration.

Yet, these systems struggle to scale in realistic enterprise settings with large, complex schemas, diverse SQL dialects, and expensive multi-step reasoning. Emerging agentic approaches show potential for adaptive reasoning but often suffer from inefficiency and instability-repeating interactions with databases, producing inconsistent outputs, and occasionally failing to generate valid answers. To address these challenges, we introduce Agent Semantic Memory (AgentSM), an agentic framework for Text-to-SQL that builds and leverages interpretable semantic memory. Instead of relying on raw scratchpads or vector retrieval, AgentSM captures prior execution traces-or synthesizes curated ones-as structured programs that directly guide future reasoning. This design enables systematic reuse of reasoning paths, which allows agents to scale to larger schemas, more complex questions, and longer trajectories efficiently and reliably. Compared to state-of-the-art systems, AgentSM achieves higher efficiency by reducing average token usage and trajectory length by 25% and 35%, respectively, on the Spider 2.0 benchmark.

Despite this growing need, the reliability of Text-to-Python in core data retrieval remains underexplored relative to the mature SQL ecosystem. To address this gap, we introduce BIRD-Python, a benchmark designed for cross-paradigm evaluation. We systematically refined the original dataset to reduce annotation noise and align execution semantics, thereby establishing a consistent and standardized baseline for comparison. Our analysis reveals a fundamental paradigmatic divergence: whereas SQL leverages implicit DBMS behaviors through its declarative structure, Python requires explicit procedural logic, making it highly sensitive to underspecified user intent. To mitigate this challenge, we propose the Logic Completion Framework (LCF), which resolves ambiguity by incorporating latent domain knowledge into the generation process. Experimental results show that (1) performance differences primarily stem from missing domain context rather than inherent limitations in code generation, and (2) when these gaps are addressed, Text-to-Python achieves performance parity with Text-to-SQL. These findings establish Python as a viable foundation for analytical agents-provided that systems effectively ground ambiguous natural language inputs in executable logical specifications.

Recent advancements in the field provide foundation models and sophisticated agentic systems pushing the boundaries of formal mathematical reasoning to approach the natural language capability of LLMs. However, little attention has been given to the formal physics reasoning, which also heavily relies on similar problem-solving and theorem-proving frameworks. To solve this problem, this paper presents, to the best of our knowledge, the first approach to enhance formal theorem proving in the physics domain. We compose a dedicated dataset PhysLeanData for the task. It is composed of theorems sampled from PhysLean and data generated by a conjecture-based formal data generation pipeline. In the training pipeline, we leverage DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B, a strong open-source mathematical theorem prover, and apply Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to train our model PhysProver. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that, using only $\\sim$5K training samples, PhysProver achieves an overall 2.4\\% improvement in multiple sub-domains. Furthermore, after formal physics training, we observe 1.3\\% gains on the MiniF2F-Test benchmark, which indicates non-trivial generalization beyond physics domains and enhancement for formal math capability as well. The results highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, which provides a paradigm for extending formal provers outside mathematical domains. To foster further research, we will release both our dataset and model to the community.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubb3c\ub9ac\ud559 \ubd84\uc57c\uc758 \uc815\ub9ac \uc99d\uba85\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, PhysLeanData\ub77c\ub294 \uc804\uc6a9 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uace0 DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec PhysProver \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\uc2dc\ud0b4\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ud558\uc704 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c 2.4%\uc758 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\uace0, MiniF2F-Test \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd94\uac00\ub85c 1.3%\uc758 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ubcf4\uc784.", "motivation": "\uc815\ud615 \ubb3c\ub9ac\ud559 \ucd94\ub860\uc774 \uc815\ub9ac \uc99d\uba85 \ubc0f \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0 \ud06c\uac8c \uc758\uc874\ud568\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \uc774 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad00\uc2ec\uc774 \uc801\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "method": "PhysLeanData\ub77c\ub294 \uc804\uc6a9 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uace0 DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards(RLVR)\ub85c PhysProver \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\uc2dc\ucf30\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc57d 5,000\uac1c\uc758 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c PhysProver\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ud558\uc704 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c 2.4%\uc758 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0, MiniF2F-Test \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c 1.3%\uc758 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uacfc \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70, \uc218\ud559\uc801 \uc601\uc5ed\uc744 \ub118\uc5b4 \uc815\ud615 \uc99d\uba85\uae30 \ud655\uc7a5\uc758 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc99d\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc5b8\uc5b4\uc640 LLM\uc758 \uc870\ud569\uc740 \uc815\ub9ac \uc99d\uba85\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc218\ud559 \ubc0f \ucef4\ud4e8\ud130 \uacfc\ud559 \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ud2f0\uc5d0 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\ucce4\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \ud615\uc2dd\uc801 \uc218\ud559\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc758 \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \ub113\ud788\uace0 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \ub2a5\ub825\uc5d0 \uc811\uadfc\ud558\ub294 \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uc815\uad50\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0 \ubc0f \uc815\ub9ac \uc99d\uba85 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0 \ud06c\uac8c \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294 \ud615\uc2dd\uc801 \ubb3c\ub9ac\ud559 \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc8fc\ubaa9\uc744 \ubc1b\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud588\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubb3c\ub9ac\ud559 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud615\uc2dd \uc815\ub9ac \uc99d\uba85\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.

Prior work leverages demonstrations and human feedback to improve learning efficiency and robustness. However, offline-to-online methods need large datasets and can be unstable, while VLA-assisted RL relies on large-scale pretraining and fine-tuning. As a result, a low-cost real-world RL method with minimal data requirements has yet to emerge. We introduce \\textbf{SigEnt-SAC}, an off-policy actor-critic method that learns from scratch using a single expert trajectory. Our key design is a sigmoid-bounded entropy term that prevents negative-entropy-driven optimization toward out-of-distribution actions and reduces Q-function oscillations. We benchmark SigEnt-SAC on D4RL tasks against representative baselines. Experiments show that SigEnt-SAC substantially alleviates Q-function oscillations and reaches a 100\\% success rate faster than prior methods. Finally, we validate SigEnt-SAC on four real-world robotic tasks across multiple embodiments, where agents learn from raw images and sparse rewards; results demonstrate that SigEnt-SAC can learn successful policies with only a small number of real-world interactions, suggesting a low-cost and practical pathway for real-world RL deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "SigEnt-SAC\ub294 \ub2e8\uc77c

Yet their overconfidence in failure remains a fundamental barrier to deployment in high-stakes settings. Existing calibration methods, built for static single-turn outputs, cannot address the unique challenges of agentic systems, such as compounding errors along trajectories, uncertainty from external tools, and opaque failure modes. To address these challenges, we introduce, for the first time, the problem of Agentic Confidence Calibration and propose Holistic Trajectory Calibration (HTC), a novel diagnostic framework that extracts rich process-level features ranging from macro dynamics to micro stability across an agent's entire trajectory. Powered by a simple, interpretable model, HTC consistently surpasses strong baselines in both calibration and discrimination, across eight benchmarks, multiple LLMs, and diverse agent frameworks. Beyond performance, HTC delivers three essential advances: it provides interpretability by revealing the signals behind failure, enables transferability by applying across domains without retraining, and achieves generalization through a General Agent Calibrator (GAC) that achieves the best calibration (lowest ECE) on the out-of-domain GAIA benchmark. Together, these contributions establish a new process-centric paradigm for confidence calibration, providing a framework for diagnosing and enhancing the reliability of AI agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5 \uc218\ud589 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \ubc1c\uc804\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc2e4\ud328\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacfc\uc2e0\uc774 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ubc30\uce58\uc758 \uc7a5\uc560\ubb3c\uc774\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub3c4 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc9c4\ub2e8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Holistic Trajectory Calibration (HTC)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc2e4\ud328\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacfc\uc2e0\uc740 \uace0\uc704\ud5d8 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubc30\uce58\ub97c \ubc29\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc7a5\ubcbd\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "Holistic Trajectory Calibration (HTC)\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc9c4\ub2e8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc804\uccb4 \uada4\uc801\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uacfc\uc815 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \ucd94\ucd9c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "HTC\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uae30\uc900\uc120\ub4e4\uc744 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\uba70, \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uacfc \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uac04 \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uacfc \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uae30\uc5ec\ub4e4\uc740 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \uc9c4\ub2e8\ud558\uace0 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \uc911\uc2ec \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 Establish \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc218\ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc2e4\ud589\ud558\ub294 \uc790\uc728 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc73c\ub85c \ube60\ub974\uac8c \ubc1c\uc804\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc2e4\ud328\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacfc\uc2e0\uc740 \uace0\uc704\ud5d8 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubc30\uce58\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uc7a5\ubcbd\uc73c\ub85c \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc815\uc801 \ub2e8\uc77c \ud134 \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uad6c\ucd95\ub41c \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubcf4\uc815 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uada4\uc801\uc744 \ub530\ub77c \ub204\uc801 \uc624\ub958, \uc678\ubd80 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131, \ubd88\ud22c\uba85\ud55c \uc2e4\ud328 \ubaa8\ub4dc\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ub3c5\ud2b9\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804\uc5d0 \ub300\ucc98\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804\uc5d0 \ub300\uc751\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub3c4 \ubcf4\uc815 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ucc98\uc74c\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uace0, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc804\uccb4 \uada4\uc801\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uac70\uc2dc\uc801 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc5d0\uc11c \ubbf8\uc2dc\uc801 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc5d0 \uc774\ub974\ub294 \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc9c4\ub2e8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Holistic Trajectory Calibration (HTC)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uac04\ub2e8\ud558\uace0 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uad6c\ub3d9\ub418\ub294 HTC\ub294 8\uac1c\uc758 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c, \uc5ec\ub7ec LLM \ubc0f \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf4\uc815 \ubc0f \uad6c\ubcc4 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc744 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ucd08\uacfc\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ub118\uc5b4 HTC\ub294 \uc2e4\ud328 \ub4a4\uc758 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0c4\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0, \uc7ac\uad50\uc721 \uc5c6\uc774 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uac04 \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uba70, \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc678 GAIA \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uace0\uc758 \ubcf4\uc815(\uac00\uc7a5 \ub0ae\uc740 ECE)\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 General Agent Calibrator (GAC)\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \uc774\ub8ec\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uae30\uc5ec\ub4e4\uc740 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \uc9c4\ub2e8\ud558\uace0 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \uc911\uc2ec \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \ud655\ub9bd\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

While the majority of existing efforts focus on enhancing policy capabilities via post-training, we propose an alternative paradigm: self-evolving the agent's ability by iteratively verifying the policy model's outputs, guided by meticulously crafted rubrics. This approach gives rise to the inference-time scaling of verification, wherein an agent self-improves by evaluating its generated answers to produce iterative feedback and refinements. We derive the rubrics based on an automatically constructed DRA Failure Taxonomy, which systematically classifies agent failures into five major categories and thirteen sub-categories. We present DeepVerifier, a rubrics-based outcome reward verifier that leverages the asymmetry of verification and outperforms vanilla agent-as-judge and LLM judge baselines by 12%-48% in meta-evaluation F1 score. To enable practical self-evolution, DeepVerifier integrates as a plug-and-play module during test-time inference. The verifier produces detailed rubric-based feedback, which is fed back to the agent for iterative bootstrapping, refining responses without additional training. This test-time scaling delivers 8%-11% accuracy gains on challenging subsets of GAIA and XBench-DeepResearch when powered by capable closed-source LLMs. Finally, to support open-source advancement, we release DeepVerifier-4K, a curated supervised fine-tuning dataset of 4,646 high-quality agent steps focused on DRA verification.

However, their potential is currently bottlenecked by the constraints of static data scaling. Existing paradigms relying primarily on passive imitation of static datasets struggle to capture the intricate causal dynamics inherent in long-horizon computer tasks. In this work, we introduce EvoCUA, a native computer use agentic model. Unlike static imitation, EvoCUA integrates data generation and policy optimization into a self-sustaining evolutionary cycle. To mitigate data scarcity, we develop a verifiable synthesis engine that autonomously generates diverse tasks coupled with executable validators. To enable large-scale experience acquisition, we design a scalable infrastructure orchestrating tens of thousands of asynchronous sandbox rollouts. Building on these massive trajectories, we propose an iterative evolving learning strategy to efficiently internalize this experience. This mechanism dynamically regulates policy updates by identifying capability boundaries -- reinforcing successful routines while transforming failure trajectories into rich supervision through error analysis and self-correction. Empirical evaluations on the OSWorld benchmark demonstrate that EvoCUA achieves a success rate of 56.7%, establishing a new open-source state-of-the-art. Notably, EvoCUA significantly outperforms the previous best open-source model, OpenCUA-72B (45.0%), and surpasses leading closed-weights models such as UI-TARS-2 (53.1%). Crucially, our results underscore the generalizability of this approach: the evolving paradigm driven by learning from experience yields consistent performance gains across foundation models of varying scales, establishing a robust and scalable path for advancing native agent capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "EvoCUA\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc0dd\uc131\uacfc \uc815\ucc45

Detecting these risks is challenging because harmful actions often accumulate gradually and recur across seemingly unrelated streams. To address this, we propose CS-VAR (Cross-Session Evidence-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Detector) for live streaming risk assessment. In CS-VAR, a lightweight, domain-specific model performs fast session-level risk inference, guided during training by a Large Language Model (LLM) that reasons over retrieved cross-session behavioral evidence and transfers its local-to-global insights to the small model. This design enables the small model to recognize recurring patterns across streams, perform structured risk assessment, and maintain efficiency for real-time deployment. Extensive offline experiments on large-scale industrial datasets, combined with online validation, demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of CS-VAR. Furthermore, CS-VAR provides interpretable, localized signals that effectively empower real-world moderation for live streaming.", "AI": {"tldr": "CS-VAR\ub294 \ub77c\uc774\ube0c \uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9ac\ubc0d \ub9ac\uc2a4\ud06c \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud601\uc2e0\uc801\uc778 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c, \uc138\uc158 \uac04 \uc99d\uac70\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ube60\ub978 \ub9ac\uc2a4\ud06c \ucd94\uc815\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub77c\uc774\ube0c \uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9ac\ubc0d\uc758 \ubd80\uc0c1\uc740 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ubcc0\ubaa8\uc2dc\ucf30\uc73c\uba70, \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc2a4\ucea0 \ubc0f \uc545\uc758\uc801\uc778 \ud589\ub3d9\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc704\ud5d8\uc5d0 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc774 \ub178\ucd9c\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "method": "CS-VAR\ub294 \uacbd\ub7c9\ud654\ub41c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\ud654 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ube60\ub978 \uc138\uc158 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ub9ac\uc2a4\ud06c \ucd94\uc815\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\uba70, \uad50\uc721 \uc911\uc5d0 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \uc9c0\ub3c4\ub97c \ubc1b\ub294\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc0b0\uc5c5 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uacfc \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 CS-VAR\uc758 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "CS-VAR\ub294 \ub77c\uc774\ube0c \uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9ac\ubc0d\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\uc81c \ubaa8\ub354\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc9c0\uc5ed \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub77c\uc774\ube0c \uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9ac\ubc0d\uc758 \ubd80\uc0c1\uc740 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ubcc0\ubaa8\uc2dc\ucf1c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \ucc38\uc5ec\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud588\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc740 \uc0ac\uae30 \ubc0f \uc870\uc9c1\ub41c \uc545\uc758\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc704\ud5d8\uc5d0 \ub178\ucd9c\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ud574\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud589\ub3d9\uc774 \uc885\uc885 \uc11c\uc11c\ud788 \ucd95\uc801\ub418\uace0 \uac89\ubcf4\uae30\uc5d0 \uad00\ub828 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9bc\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub77c\uc774\ube0c \uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9ac\ubc0d \uc704\ud5d8 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc704\ud55c CS-VAR(\uc138\uc158 \uac04 \uc99d\uac70 \uc778\uc2dd \uac80\uc0c9 \uc99d\uac15 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uae30)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

While prior work emphasizes turn-local sentiment or static emotion classification, the role of explicit affective dynamics in shaping long-horizon agent behavior remains underexplored. This work investigates whether imposing dynamical structure on an external affective state can induce temporal coherence and controlled recovery in multi-turn dialogue. We introduce an agent-level affective subsystem that maintains a continuous Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) state external to the language model and governed by first- and second-order update rules. Instantaneous affective signals are extracted using a fixed, memoryless estimator and integrated over time via exponential smoothing or momentum-based dynamics. The resulting affective state is injected back into generation without modifying model parameters. Using a fixed 25-turn dialogue protocol, we compare stateless, first-order, and second-order affective dynamics. Stateless agents fail to exhibit coherent trajectories or recovery, while state persistence enables delayed responses and reliable recovery. Second-order dynamics introduce affective inertia and hysteresis that increase with momentum, revealing a trade-off between stability and responsiveness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uae34 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uc911 \uc5b4\uc870\uc640 \uc778\uaca9\uc758 \uac11\uc791\uc2a4\ub7ec\uc6b4 \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \uc9c0\ubc30\ud558\ub294 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\uac04 \uad6c\uc870\uc758 \ubd80\uc7ac\ub97c \ubc18\uc601\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc678\ubd80 \uc815\uc11c \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0 \ub3d9\uc801 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ubd80\uc5ec\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc911 \ud134 \ub300\ud654\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\uac04 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uacfc \ud1b5\uc81c\ub41c \ud68c\ubcf5\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc0c1\ud0dc\uac00 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uada4\uc801\uc774\ub098 \ud68c\ubcf5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc758 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc131\uc740 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc751\ub2f5 \ubc0f \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud68c\ubcf5\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub450 \ubc88\uc9f8 \ucc28\uc218\uc758 \ub3d9\uc801 \uad6c\uc870\uac00 \uc815\uc11c\uc801 \uad00\uc131\uacfc \ud788\uc2a4\ud14c\ub9ac\uc2dc\uc2a4\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ubaa8\uba58\ud140\uacfc \ud568\uaed8 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uc5ec \uc548\uc815\uc131\uacfc \ubc18\uc751\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ub4dc\uc624\ud504\ub97c \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uae34 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ub3d9\uc548 \uac11\uc791\uc2a4\ub7ec\uc6b4 \uc5b4\uc870\uc640 \uc778\uaca9\uc758 \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \ubcf4\uc774\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc788\uc5b4, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \uc9c0\ubc30\ud558\ub294 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\uac04 \uad6c\uc870\uac00 \uacb0\uc5ec\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubc18\uc601\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\uc804 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud134-\ub85c\uceec \uc815\uc11c \ub610\ub294 \uc815\uc801\uc778 \uac10\uc815 \ubd84\ub958\uc5d0 \uc911\uc810\uc744 \ub450\uc5c8\uc73c\ub098, \uc7a5\uae30\uc801\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud615\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\uc5b4 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc778 \uc815\uc11c\uc801 \uc5ed\ud559\uc758 \uc5ed\ud560\uc740 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \ud0d0\uad6c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc678\ubd80 \uc815\uc11c \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0 \ub3d9\uc801 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ubd80\uc5ec\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud134 \ub300\ud654\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\uac04 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uacfc \ud1b5\uc81c\ub41c \ud68c\ubcf5\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0 \uc870\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc678\ubd80\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5f0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uace0, 1\ucc28 \ubc0f 2\ucc28 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8 \uaddc\uce59\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc9c0\ubc30\ub418\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc815\uc11c\uc801 \ud558\uc704 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc21c\uac04\uc801\uc778 \uc815\uc11c \uc2e0\ud638\ub294 \uace0\uc815\ub41c \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc5c6\ub294 \ucd94\uc815\uae30\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ucd94\ucd9c\ub418\uba70, \uc2dc\uac04\uc774 \uc9c0\ub0a8\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc9c0\uc218 \ud3c9\ud65c\ud654 \ub610\ub294 \ubaa8\uba58\ud140 \uae30\ubc18 \uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud1b5\ud569\ub41c\ub2e4. \uacb0\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa8\ub378 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uc218\uc815\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc815\uc11c \uc0c1\ud0dc\uac00 \uc7ac\uc8fc\uc785\ub41c\ub2e4. \uace0\uc815\ub41c 25\ud134 \ub300\ud654 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \uc0c1\ud0dc\uac00 \uc5c6\ub294, 1\ucc28 \ubc0f 2\ucc28 \uc815\uc11c\uc801 \uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \ube44\uad50\ud574\ubcf8\ub2e4. \uc0c1\ud0dc\uac00 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uada4\uc801\uc774\ub098 \ud68c\ubcf5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\ub098, \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc758 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc131\uc740 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc751\ub2f5 \ubc0f \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud68c\ubcf5\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4. 2\ucc28 \ub3d9\uc801 \uad6c\uc870\ub294 \uc815\uc11c\uc801 \uad00\uc131\uacfc \ud788\uc2a4\ud14c\ub9ac\uc2dc\uc2a4\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ubaa8\uba58\ud140\uacfc \ud568\uaed8 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uc5ec \uc548\uc815\uc131\uacfc \ubc18\uc751\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ub4dc\uc624\ud504\ub97c \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b8\ub2e4."}}
