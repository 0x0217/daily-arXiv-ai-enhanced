However, the mechanisms governing the effectiveness of MAS built upon publicly available LLMs, specifically the underlying rationales for their success or failure, remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we revisit MAS through the perspective of uncertainty, considering both intra- and inter-agent dynamics by investigating entropy transitions during problem-solving across various topologies and six benchmark tasks. By analyzing 245 features spanning token-, trajectory-, and round-level entropy, we counterintuitively find that a single agent outperforms MAS in approximately 43.3% of cases, and that uncertainty dynamics are largely determined during the first round of interaction. Furthermore, we provide three key observations: 1) Certainty Preference: reducing uncertainty at any stage for any agent is critical for guaranteeing correct solutions; 2) Base Uncertainty: base models with lower entropy during problem-solving directly benefit MAS performance; and 3) Task Awareness: entropy dynamics of MAS play varying roles across different tasks. Building on these insights, we introduce a simple yet effective algorithm, the Entropy Judger, to select solutions from MAS's pass@k results, leading to consistent accuracy improvements across all MAS configurations and tasks.

Although recent advances in multi-agent LLM-based systems have enhanced their mathematical reasoning capabilities, they still lack a reliably revisable representation of the reasoning process. Existing agents either operate in rigid sequential pipelines that cannot correct earlier steps or rely on heuristic self-evaluation that can fail to identify and fix errors. In addition, programmatic context can distract language models and degrade accuracy. To address these gaps, we introduce Iteratively Improved Program Construction (IIPC), a reasoning method that iteratively refines programmatic reasoning chains and combines execution feedback with the native Chain-of-thought abilities of the base LLM to maintain high-level contextual focus. IIPC surpasses competing approaches in the majority of reasoning benchmarks on multiple base LLMs. All code and implementations are released as open source.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5\uc758 \uc218\ud559\uc801 \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c Iteratively Improved Program Construction (IIPC) \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uace0, \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4\ub294 \ub0b4\uc6a9\uc744 \ub2f4\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5\uc758 \uc0ac\uace0 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uad50\uc721, \uacfc\ud559, \uacf5\ud559 \ub4f1\uc758 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc0c1\uc9d5\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc774 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc778 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc73c\ub85c\uc11c \uc218\ud559\uc801 \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uae30\uc900\uc774 \ub41c\ub2e4.", "method": "Iteratively Improved Program Construction (IIPC)\ub77c\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \uc0ac\uc2ac\uc744 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0 \uc2e4\ud589 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \uae30\uc874 LLM\uc758 \uccb4\uc778-\uc624\ube0c-\uc0dd\uac01 \ub2a5\ub825\uacfc \uacb0\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "IIPC\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uae30\ubcf8 LLM\uc758 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uacbd\uc7c1\ud558\ub294 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubaa8\ub4e0 \ucf54\ub4dc\uc640 \uad6c\ud604\ubb3c\uc740 \uc624\ud508 \uc18c\uc2a4\ub85c \uc81c\uacf5\ub41c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc218\ud559\uc801 \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0\uc740 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uae30\ubcf8 \uae30\uc900\uc774\uba70 \uad50\uc721, \uacfc\ud559 \ubc0f \uacf5\ud559 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uae30\ud638\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc774 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc778 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc73c\ub85c \uc5f0\uacb0\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ud559\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ucd94\ub860 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \uc218\uc815 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud615\ud0dc\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc218\uc815\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \uacbd\uc9c1\ub41c \uc21c\ucc28 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0 \uc218\uc815\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud560 \uc704\ud5d8 \uc788\ub294 \uc790\uae30 \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc740 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ubc29\ud574\ud558\uace0 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uc800\ud558\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacf5\ubc31\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Iteratively Improved Program Construction (IIPC)\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uba70, \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \uc0ac\uc2ac\uc744 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0, \uae30\ubcf8 LLM\uc758 \uace0\uc720\ud55c \uccb4\uc778-\uc624\ube0c-\uc0dd\uac01 \ub2a5\ub825\uacfc \uc2e4\ud589 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uace0\uc218\uc900\uc758 \ub9e5\ub77d \uc9d1\uc911\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

This paper proposes AgentArk, a novel framework to distill multi-agent dynamics into the weights of a single model, effectively transforming explicit test-time interactions into implicit model capabilities. This equips a single agent with the intelligence of multi-agent systems while remaining computationally efficient. Specifically, we investigate three hierarchical distillation strategies across various models, tasks, scaling, and scenarios: reasoning-enhanced fine-tuning; trajectory-based augmentation; and process-aware distillation. By shifting the burden of computation from inference to training, the distilled models preserve the efficiency of one agent while exhibiting strong reasoning and self-correction performance of multiple agents. They further demonstrate enhanced robustness and generalization across diverse reasoning tasks. We hope this work can shed light on future research on efficient and robust multi-agent development.

Under review", "summary": "We prove the conjecture stated in Appendix F.3 of [Zhu et al. (2022)]: among all conversion rules that map a R\u00e9nyi Differential Privacy (RDP) profile $\u03c4\\mapsto \u03c1(\u03c4)$ to a valid hypothesis-testing trade-off $f$, the rule based on the intersection of single-order RDP privacy regions is optimal. This optimality holds simultaneously for all valid RDP profiles and for all Type I error levels $\u03b1$. Concretely, we show that in the space of trade-off functions, the tightest possible bound is $f_{\u03c1(\\cdot)}(\u03b1) = \\sup_{\u03c4\\geq 0.5} f_{\u03c4,\u03c1(\u03c4)}(\u03b1)$: the pointwise maximum of the single-order bounds for each RDP privacy region. Our proof unifies and sharpens the insights of [Balle et al. (2019)], [Asoodeh et al. (2021)], and [Zhu et al. (2022)]. Our analysis relies on a precise geometric characterization of the RDP privacy region, leveraging its convexity and the fact that its boundary is determined exclusively by Bernoulli mechanisms.

The looseness and estimator-dependent bias can make IB \"compression\" only indirectly controlled and optimization fragile.\n  We revisit the IB problem through the lens of information geometry and propose a \\textbf{Geo}metric \\textbf{I}nformation \\textbf{B}ottleneck (\\textbf{GeoIB}) that dispenses with mutual information (MI) estimation. We show that I(X;Z) and I(Z;Y) admit exact projection forms as minimal Kullback-Leibler (KL) distances from the joint distributions to their respective independence manifolds. Guided by this view, GeoIB controls information compression with two complementary terms: (i) a distribution-level Fisher-Rao (FR) discrepancy, which matches KL to second order and is reparameterization-invariant; and (ii) a geometry-level Jacobian-Frobenius (JF) term that provides a local capacity-type upper bound on I(Z;X) by penalizing pullback volume expansion of the encoder. We further derive a natural-gradient optimizer consistent with the FR metric and prove that the standard additive natural-gradient step is first-order equivalent to the geodesic update. We conducted extensive experiments and observed that the GeoIB achieves a better trade-off between prediction accuracy and compression ratio in the information plane than the mainstream IB baselines on popular datasets. GeoIB improves invariance and optimization stability by unifying distributional and geometric regularization under a single bottleneck multiplier.

Recent advances in applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to embodied agents have addressed many long-standing challenges, such as high-level goal decomposition and online adaptation. Yet, uncertainty is still primarily mitigated through frequent inter-agent communication. This incurs substantial token and time costs, and can disrupt established workflows, when human partners are involved. We introduce PCE, a Planner-Composer-Evaluator framework that converts the fragmented assumptions latent in LLM reasoning traces into a structured decision tree. Internal nodes encode environment assumptions and leaves map to actions; each path is then scored by scenario likelihood, goal-directed gain, and execution cost to guide rational action selection without heavy communication. Across two challenging multi-agent benchmarks (C-WAH and TDW-MAT) and three diverse LLM backbones, PCE consistently outperforms communication-centric baselines in success rate and task efficiency while showing comparable token usage. Ablation results indicate that the performance gains obtained by scaling model capacity or reasoning depth persist even when PCE is applied, while PCE consistently raises the baseline across both capacity and reasoning-depth scales, confirming that structured uncertainty handling complements both forms of scaling. A user study further demonstrates that PCE produces communication patterns that human partners perceive as more efficient and trustworthy.

By modeling directories as topics and users as agents within a multi-level interaction graph, we simulate access evolution using influence-weighted opinion dynamics. Logical dependencies between users are encoded in dynamic matrices Ci, and directory similarity is captured via a shared influence matrix W. Malicious behavior is injected as cross-component logical perturbations that violate structural norms of strongly connected components(SCCs). We apply theoretical guarantees from opinion dynamics literature to determine topic convergence and detect anomaly via scaled opinion variance. To quantify uncertainty, we introduce a Bayesian anomaly scoring mechanism that evolves over time, using both static and online priors. Simulations over synthetic access graphs validate our method, demonstrating its sensitivity to logical inconsistencies and robustness under dynamic perturbation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uae30\uc5c5 \ub514\ub809\ud1a0\ub9ac \uc811\uadfc \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc5d0\uc11c \uc545\uc758\uc801\uc778 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ucee8\uc13c\uc11c\uc2a4 \uae30\ubc18 \ubca0\uc774esian \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub514\ub809\ud1a0\ub9ac \uc811\uadfc \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc5d0\uc11c \uc545\uc758\uc801\uc778 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ud544\uc694\uc131.", "method": "\ub514\ub809\ud1a0\ub9ac\ub97c \uc8fc\uc81c, \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\ub97c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uace0 \uc601\ud5a5\ub825 \uac00\uc911 \uc758\uacac \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc811\uadfc \uc9c4\ud654\ub97c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158.", "result": "\uc545\uc758\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uac15\ub825\ud558\uac8c \uc5f0\uacb0\ub41c \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c(SCC)\uc758 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uaddc\ubc94\uc744 \uc704\ubc18\ud558\ub294 \uad50\ucc28 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801 \ud63c\ub780\uc73c\ub85c \uc8fc\uc785\ud558\uc600\uace0, \uc758\uacac \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559 \ubb38\ud5cc\uc758 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc8fc\uc81c \uc218\ub834\uc744 \uacb0\uc815\ud558\uace0 \uc774\uc0c1\uce58\ub97c \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud568.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubbfc\uac10\uc131\uacfc \ub3d9\uc801 \ud63c\ub780\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uacac\uace0\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \uc791\uc5c5\uc740 \uae30\uc5c5 \ub514\ub809\ud1a0\ub9ac \uc811\uadfc \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc5d0\uc11c \uc545\uc758\uc801\uc778 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ucee8\uc13c\uc11c\uc2a4 \uae30\ubc18 \ubca0\uc774esian \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub514\ub809\ud1a0\ub9ac\ub97c \uc8fc\uc81c, \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\ub97c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc218\uc900 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc791\uc6a9 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ub0b4\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uc5ec \uc601\ud5a5\ub825 \uac00\uc911 \uc758\uacac \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc811\uadfc \uc9c4\ud654\ub97c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uac04\uc758 \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc740 \ub3d9\uc801 \ud589\ub82c Ci\uc5d0 \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ub418\uba70, \ub514\ub809\ud1a0\ub9ac \uc720\uc0ac\uc131\uc740 \uacf5\uc720 \uc601\ud5a5\ub825 \ud589\ub82c W\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud3ec\ucc29\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc545\uc758\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9\uc740 \uac15\ub825\ud558\uac8c \uc5f0\uacb0\ub41c \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c(SCC)\uc758 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uaddc\ubc94\uc744 \uc704\ubc18\ud558\ub294 \uad50\ucc28 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc12d\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc8fc\uc785\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc758\uacac \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559 \ubb38\ud5cc\uc758 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc8fc\uc81c \uc218\ub834\uc744 \uacb0\uc815\ud558\uace0 \ud655\ub300\ub41c \uc758\uacac \ubd84\uc0b0\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\uc0c1\uce58\ub97c \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc815\uc801 \ubc0f \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uc0ac\uc804 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc2dc\uac04\uc774 \uc9c0\ub0a8\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc9c4\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ubca0\uc774esian \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc810\uc218 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud569\uc131 \uc811\uadfc \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc740 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uba70, \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubbfc\uac10\uc131\uacfc \ub3d9\uc801 \uc12d\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacac\uace0\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

We propose a novel, lightweight framework that relaxes the strict requirements on Super-Structure construction while preserving the algorithmic benefits of divide-and-conquer. By integrating weakly constrained Super-Structures with efficient graph partitioning and merging strategies, our approach substantially lowers CI test overhead without sacrificing accuracy. We instantiate the framework in a concrete causal discovery algorithm and rigorously evaluate its components on synthetic data. Comprehensive experiments on Gaussian Bayesian networks, including magic-NIAB, ECOLI70, and magic-IRRI, demonstrate that our method matches or closely approximates the structural accuracy of PC and FCI while drastically reducing the number of CI tests. Further validation on the real-world China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) dataset confirms its practical applicability. Our results establish that accurate, scalable causal discovery is achievable even under minimal assumptions about the initial Super-Structure, opening new avenues for applying divide-and-conquer methods to large-scale, knowledge-scarce domains such as biomedical and social science research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 Super-Structure \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ubd84\ud560

However, as tasks grow broader, the key bottleneck shifts from individual competence to organizational capability. In this work, we explore a complementary dimension of width scaling with multi-agent systems to address broad information seeking. Existing multi-agent systems often rely on hand-crafted workflows and turn-taking interactions that fail to parallelize work effectively. To bridge this gap, we propose WideSeek-R1, a lead-agent-subagent framework trained via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to synergize scalable orchestration and parallel execution. By utilizing a shared LLM with isolated contexts and specialized tools, WideSeek-R1 jointly optimizes the lead agent and parallel subagents on a curated dataset of 20k broad information-seeking tasks. Extensive experiments show that WideSeek-R1-4B achieves an item F1 score of 40.0% on the WideSearch benchmark, which is comparable to the performance of single-agent DeepSeek-R1-671B. Furthermore, WideSeek-R1-4B exhibits consistent performance gains as the number of parallel subagents increases, highlighting the effectiveness of width scaling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub113\uc774 \ud655\uc7a5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\uace0, WideSeek-R1\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc774 \uae4a\uc774 \ud655\uc7a5\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ud655\uc7a5\ub428\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uac1c\uc778\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \uc544\ub2cc \uc870\uc9c1\uc758 \uc5ed\ub7c9\uc774 \ud575\uc2ec \ubcd1\ubaa9\uc810\uc774 \ub428\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ud3ed \ud655\uc7a5\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud568.", "method": "WideSeek-R1\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(MARL)\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc8fc \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 - \ud558\uc704 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc870\uc815 \ubc0f \ubcd1\ub82c \uc2e4\ud589\uc744 \uc2dc\ub108\uc9c0 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \ub0b4\ub3c4\ub85d \uc124\uacc4\ub428.", "result": "WideSeek-R1-4B\ub294 WideSearch \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c 40.0%\uc758 \ud56d\ubaa9 F1 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc5ec, \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc778 DeepSeek-R1-671B\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \uc720\uc0ac\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc784.", "conclusion": "WideSeek-R1-4B\ub294 \ubcd1\ub82c \ud558\uc704 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc218\uac00 \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90c\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ud3ed \ud655\uc7a5\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uac15\uc870\ud568.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \uc8fc\ub85c \uae4a\uc774 \ud655\uc7a5\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uc5b4, \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ucd94\ub860\uacfc \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \uc7a5\uae30 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc810\uc744 \ub450\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc791\uc5c5\uc774 \ub354 \ub113\uc5b4\uc9c8\uc218\ub85d \ud575\uc2ec \ubcd1\ubaa9\uc810\uc740 \uac1c\uc778\uc758 \uc5ed\ub7c9\uc5d0\uc11c \uc870\uc9c1\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\ud658\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud3ed \ud655\uc7a5\uc758 \ubcf4\uc644\uc801\uc778 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc778 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud3ed\ub113\uc740 \uc815\ubcf4 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8f9\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ubcd1\ub82c\ud654\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \uc218\uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \ub9cc\ub4e0 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc640 \ud134 \ud14c\uc774\ud0b9 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uc18c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc624\ucf00\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub808\uc774\uc158\uacfc \ubcd1\ub82c \uc2e4\ud589\uc744 \uc2dc\ub108\uc9c0\ub97c \ub0b4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(MARL)\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc8fc \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8-\ud558\uc704 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 WideSeek-R1\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uace0\ub9bd\ub41c \ub9e5\ub77d\uacfc \uc804\ubb38 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \uacf5\uc720 LLM\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368, WideSeek-R1\uc740 20,000\uac1c\uc758 \ud3ed\ub113\uc740 \uc815\ubcf4 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud050\ub808\uc774\uc158\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc73c\ub85c \uc8fc \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \ubcd1\ub82c \ud558\uc704 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uacf5\ub3d9 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, WideSeek-R1-4B\ub294 WideSearch \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c 40.0%\uc758 \ud56d\ubaa9 F1 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc5ec, \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 DeepSeek-R1-671B\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \uc720\uc0ac\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac8c\ub2e4\uac00, WideSeek-R1-4B\ub294 \ubcd1\ub82c \ud558\uc704 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc218\uac00 \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, \ud3ed \ud655\uc7a5\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

We present AURA (Autonomous Urban Resource Allocator), a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning system for real-time affordable housing site selection under hard regulatory constraints (QCT, DDA, LIHTC). We model the task as a constrained multi-objective Markov decision process optimizing accessibility, environmental impact, construction cost, and social equity while enforcing feasibility. AURA uses a regulatory-aware state encoding 127 federal and local constraints, Pareto-constrained policy gradients with feasibility guarantees, and reward decomposition separating immediate costs from long-term social outcomes. On datasets from 8 U.S. metros (47,392 candidate parcels), AURA attains 94.3% regulatory compliance and improves Pareto hypervolume by 37.2% over strong baselines. In a New York City 2026 case study, it reduces selection time from 18 months to 72 hours and identifies 23% more viable sites; chosen sites have 31% better transit access and 19% lower environmental impact than expert picks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uaddc\uc81c \uc81c\uc57d \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \uc800\ub834\ud55c \uc8fc\ud0dd \ubd80\uc9c0 \uc120\uc815\uc744 \uc704\ud55c AURA\ub77c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc800\ub834\ud55c \uc8fc\ud0dd \ubd80\uc871 \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \uc218\uc2ed\uc5b5 \uba85\uc5d0\uac8c \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\uba70, \ud1a0\uc9c0 \ubd80\uc871\uacfc \uaddc\uc81c\uac00 \ubd80\uc9c0 \uc120\ud0dd\uc744 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "AURA\ub294 \uc811\uadfc\uc131, \ud658\uacbd \uc601\ud5a5, \uac74\uc124 \ube44\uc6a9 \ubc0f \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \ud615\ud3c9\uc131\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \uc81c\uc57d\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa9\ud45c \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "AURA\ub294 8\uac1c \ubbf8\uad6d \ub300\ub3c4\uc2dc\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c 94.3%\uc758 \uaddc\uc81c \uc900\uc218\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uae30\uc900 \ub300\ube44 Pareto \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ubcfc\ub968\uc744 37.2% \uac1c\uc120\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub274\uc695\uc2dc 2026 \uc0ac\ub840 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c AURA\ub294 \uc120\uc815 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 18\uac1c\uc6d4\uc5d0\uc11c 72\uc2dc\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e8\ucd95\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0, 23% \ub354 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubd80\uc9c0\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc800\ub834\ud55c \uc8fc\ud0dd \ubd80\uc871 \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \uc218\uc2ed\uc5b5 \uba85\uc5d0\uac8c \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\uba70, \ud1a0\uc9c0 \ubd80\uc871\uacfc \uaddc\uc81c\uac00 \ubd80\uc9c0 \uc120\ud0dd\uc744 \ub290\ub9ac\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4ed\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uaddc\uc81c \uc81c\uc57d(\uc608: QCT, DDA, LIHTC) \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \uc800\ub834\ud55c \uc8fc\ud0dd \ubd80\uc9c0 \uc120\uc815\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc778 AURA(\uc790\uc728 \ub3c4\uc2dc \uc790\uc6d0 \ud560\ub2f9\uae30)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc811\uadfc\uc131, \ud658\uacbd \uc601\ud5a5, \uac74\uc124 \ube44\uc6a9 \ubc0f \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \ud615\ud3c9\uc131\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc81c\uc57d\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa9\ud45c \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uacb0\uc815 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Learned world models can cheaply predict missing facts, but prediction errors can silently induce infeasible commitments. We present \\textbf{Active Epistemic Control (AEC)}, an epistemic-categorical planning layer that integrates model-based belief management with categorical feasibility checks. AEC maintains a strict separation between a \\emph{grounded fact store} used for commitment and a \\emph{belief store} used only for pruning candidate plans. At each step, it either queries the environment to ground an unresolved predicate when uncertainty is high or predictions are ambiguous, or simulates the predicate to filter hypotheses when confidence is sufficient. Final commitment is gated by grounded precondition coverage and an SQ-BCP pullback-style compatibility check, so simulated beliefs affect efficiency but cannot directly certify feasibility. Experiments on ALFWorld and ScienceWorld show that AEC achieves competitive success with fewer replanning rounds than strong LLM-agent baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubd80\ubd84 \uad00\uce21 \ud558\uc758 \uc778\ud130\ub799\ud2f0\ube0c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uacc4\ud68d \uc218\ub9bd \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uace0, \ube44\uc6a9 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc608\uce21\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 'Active Epistemic Control (AEC)'\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubd80\ubd84 \uad00\uce21 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uacc4\ud68d\uc740 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uc2dc \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc778 \uc804\uc81c\uc870\uac74\uc774 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud560 \ub54c \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc774\uba70, \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud655\ubcf4\ud558\uae30\ub294 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4e0\ub2e4.", "method": "AEC\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18 \uc2e0\ub150 \uad00\ub9ac\uc640 \ubc94\uc8fc\uc801 \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \uac80\uc0ac\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \uacc4\ud68d \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\uc774\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc AEC\ub294 ALFWorld\uc640 ScienceWorld\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c LLM-agent \uae30\ubc18\uc120\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc801\uc740 \uc7ac\uacc4\ud68d \ub77c\uc6b4\ub4dc\ub85c \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uc131\uacf5\uc744 \uac70\ub450\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "AEC\ub294 \uc815\ubcf4\uc758 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc774 \ub192\uac70\ub098 \uc608\uce21\uc774 \ubaa8\ud638\ud560 \ub54c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \uc9c8\uc758\ud558\uc5ec \ud574\uacb0\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uc220\uc5b4\ub97c \uad6c\uccb4\ud654\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc790\uc2e0\uac10\uc774 \ucda9\ubd84\ud560 \ub54c \uac00\uc124\uc744 \ud544\ud130\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc778\ud130\ub799\ud2f0\ube0c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uacc4\ud68d \uc218\ub9bd\uc740 \ubd80\ubd84 \uad00\uce21 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uc2dc \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc804\uc81c\uc870\uac74(\uc608: \uac1d\uccb4 \uc704\uce58\ub098 \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108 \uc0c1\ud0dc)\uc740 \uc54c \uc218 \uc5c6\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\ub97c \uad6c\uccb4\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uacfc\uc815\uc740 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4e0\ub2e4. \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ube60\ub974\uac8c \ub204\ub77d\ub41c \uc0ac\uc2e4\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc608\uce21 \uc624\ub958\ub294 \uc2e4\ud589 \ubd88\uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc57d\uc18d\uc744 \uc870\uc6a9\ud788 \uc720\ubc1c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18 \uc2e0\ub150 \uad00\ub9ac\uc640 \ubc94\uc8fc\uc801 \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \uac80\uc0ac\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c Epistemic-Categorical Planning Layer\uc778 Active Epistemic Control (AEC)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

Thus, a shock to one token may result in significant and uncontrolled contagion effects. As the DeFi ecosystem becomes increasingly linked with traditional financial infrastructure through instruments, such as stablecoins, the risk posed by this dynamic demands more powerful quantification tools. We introduce DeXposure-FM, the first time-series, graph foundation model for measuring and forecasting inter-protocol credit exposure on DeFi networks, to the best of our knowledge. Employing a graph-tabular encoder, with pre-trained weight initialization, and multiple task-specific heads, DeXposure-FM is trained on the DeXposure dataset that has 43.7 million data entries, across 4,300+ protocols on 602 blockchains, covering 24,300+ unique tokens. The training is operationalized for credit-exposure forecasting, predicting the joint dynamics of (1) protocol-level flows, and (2) the topology and weights of credit-exposure links. The DeXposure-FM is empirically validated on two machine learning benchmarks; it consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches, including a graph foundation model and temporal graph neural networks. DeXposure-FM further produces financial economics tools that support macroprudential monitoring and scenario-based DeFi stress testing, by enabling protocol-level systemic-importance scores, sector-level spillover and concentration measures via a forecast-then-measure pipeline. Empirical verification fully supports our financial economics tools. The model and code have been publicly available.

However, many real-world decision-making tasks are inherently online: crucial information must be acquired through interaction, feedback is delayed, and effective behavior requires balancing information collection and exploitation over time. While in-context learning enables adaptation without weight updates, existing LLMs often struggle to reliably leverage in-context interaction experience in such settings. In this work, we show that this limitation can be addressed through training. We introduce ORBIT, a multi-task, multi-episode meta-reinforcement learning framework that trains LLMs to learn from interaction in context. After meta-training, a relatively small open-source model (Qwen3-14B) demonstrates substantially improved in-context online learning on entirely unseen environments, matching the performance of GPT-5.2 and outperforming standard RL fine-tuning by a large margin. Scaling experiments further reveal consistent gains with model size, suggesting significant headroom for learn-at-inference-time decision-making agents.

Unfortunately, CP uncertainty regions can grow significantly in long horizon missions, rendering the statistical guarantees uninformative. To that end, we propose infusing CP with geometric information via group-averaging of the pretrained predictor to distribute the non-conformity mass across the orbits. Each sample now is treated as a representative of an orbit, thus uncertainty can be mitigated by other samples entangled to it via the orbit inducing elements of the symmetry group. Our approach provably yields contracted non-conformity scores in increasing convex order, implying improved exponential-tail bounds and sharper conformal prediction sets in expectation, especially at high confidence levels.

Existing reconstruction methods face distinct bottlenecks: conventional parametric/generative models are prone to hallucinations due to over-reliance on internal memory, while retrieval-augmented frameworks struggle with retrieval rigidity. Critically, these end-to-end architectures are fundamentally constrained by Semantic-Detail Entanglement -- a structural conflict between logical reasoning and signal synthesis that compromises fidelity. In this paper, we present \\textbf{\\underline{O}}mni-\\textbf{\\underline{M}}odality \\textbf{\\underline{G}}eneration Agent (\\textbf{OMG-Agent}), a novel framework that shifts the paradigm from static mapping to a dynamic coarse-to-fine Agentic Workflow. By mimicking a \\textit{deliberate-then-act} cognitive process, OMG-Agent explicitly decouples the task into three synergistic stages: (1) an MLLM-driven Semantic Planner that resolves input ambiguity via Progressive Contextual Reasoning, creating a deterministic structured semantic plan; (2) a non-parametric Evidence Retriever that grounds abstract semantics in external knowledge; and (3) a Retrieval-Injected Executor that utilizes retrieved evidence as flexible feature prompts to overcome rigidity and synthesize high-fidelity details. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that OMG-Agent consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods, maintaining robustness under extreme missingness, e.g., a $2.6$-point gain on CMU-MOSI at $70$\\% missing rates.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd88\uc644\uc804\uc131\uc774 \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \uc800\ud574\ud55c\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubcf5\uc6d0 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 OMG-Agent\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \uc800\ud574\ud558\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd88\uc644\uc804\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "OMG-Agent\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub85c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uba85\ud655\ud558\uac8c \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801 \uac70\uce60\uac8c-\ubbf8\uc138\ud558\uac8c \uc9c4\ud589\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub97c \ucc44\ud0dd\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "OMG-Agent\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc744 \uc77c\uad00\uc131 \uc788\uac8c \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\uba70 \uadf9\ub2e8\uc801 \uacb0\uce21\uce58 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uac15\uac74\ud568\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "OMG-Agent\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\uc874 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc744 \ub2a5\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd88\uc644\uc804\uc131\uc740 \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \uc2ec\uac01\ud558\uac8c \uc800\ud574\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubcf5\uc6d0 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \ub69c\ub837\ud55c \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\ub2e4: \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218/\uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ub0b4\ubd80 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\uc5d0 \uacfc\ub3c4\ud558\uac8c \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \ud658\uac01\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\uace0, \uac80\uc0c9 \ubcf4\uac15 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uac80\uc0c9 \uacbd\uc9c1\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc885\ub2e8 \uac04 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub294 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \uc800\ud574\ud558\ub294 \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uacfc \uc2e0\ud638 \ud569\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uac08\ub4f1\uc778 \uc758\ubbf8-\uc138\ubd80 \uc0ac\ud56d \uc5bd\ud798(Semantic-Detail Entanglement)\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\ud55c\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc815\uc801 \ub9e4\ud551\uc5d0\uc11c \ub3d9\uc801 \uac70\uce60\uac8c-\ubbf8\uc138\ud558\uac8c \uc9c4\ud589\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub85c \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \uc804\ud658\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 OMG-Agent\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

Our primary contribution is GroupCLIP, a novel group-level contrastive loss that bridges the gap between CLIP for paired cross-modal data and SupCon for uni-modal supervised contrastive learning, addressing a fundamental gap in contrastive learning for weakly-paired settings. We integrate GroupCLIP with an on-the-fly backtranslating autoencoder framework to encourage cross-modally entangled representations while maintaining group-level coherence within a shared latent space. Critically, we introduce a comprehensive combinatorial evaluation framework that systematically assesses representation learners across multiple optimal transport aligners, addressing key limitations in existing evaluation strategies. This framework includes novel simulations that systematically vary shared versus modality-specific perturbation effects enabling principled assessment of method robustness. Our combinatorial benchmarking reveals that there is not yet an aligner that uniformly dominates across settings or modality pairs. Across simulations and two real single-cell genetic perturbation datasets, GROOVE performs on par with or outperforms existing approaches for downstream cross-modal matching and imputation tasks. Our ablation studies demonstrate that GroupCLIP is the key component driving performance gains. These results highlight the importance of leveraging group-level constraints for effective multi-modal representation learning in scenarios where only weak pairing is available.", "AI": {"tldr":

However, most existing work relies on large-scale demonstrations from technical professionals and close monitoring of the training process. These are challenging for a layperson when they want to teach the agent new skills. To lower the barrier of teaching AI agents, we propose Interactive Policy Restructuring and Training (InterPReT), which takes user instructions to continually update the policy structure and optimize its parameters to fit user demonstrations. This enables end-users to interactively give instructions and demonstrations, monitor the agent's performance, and review the agent's decision-making strategies. A user study (N=34) on teaching an AI agent to drive in a racing game confirms that our approach yields more robust policies without impairing system usability, compared to a generic imitation learning baseline, when a layperson is responsible for both giving demonstrations and determining when to stop.

However, current approaches remain predominantly stateless, discarding successful reasoning patterns after each problem instance and failing to mimic the empirical accumulation of wisdom characteristic of human problem-solving. To bridge this gap, we introduce Empirical-MCTS, a dual-loop framework that transforms stateless search into a continuous, non-parametric learning process. The framework unifies local exploration with global memory optimization through two novel mechanisms: Pairwise-Experience-Evolutionary Meta-Prompting (PE-EMP) and a Memory Optimization Agent. PE-EMP functions as a reflexive optimizer within the local search, utilizing pairwise feedback to dynamically synthesize adaptive criteria and evolve meta-prompts (system prompts) in real-time. Simultaneously, the Memory Optimization Agent manages a global repository as a dynamic policy prior, employing atomic operations to distill high-quality insights across problems. Extensive evaluations on complex reasoning benchmarks, including AIME25, ARC-AGI-2, and MathArena Apex, demonstrate that Empirical-MCTS significantly outperforms both stateless MCTS strategies and standalone experience-driven agents. These results underscore the critical necessity of coupling structured search with empirical accumulation for mastering complex, open-ended reasoning tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Empirical-MCTS\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ube44\uc815\uc801 \uac80\uc0c9\uc744 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ube44\ubaa8\uc218\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5 \uacfc\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub294 \uc774\uc911 \ub8e8\ud504 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \uc804\ub7b5\uc740 \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc778 \ucd94\ub860 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ubc84\ub9ac\uace0 \uc778\uac04 \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0\uc758 \uc9c0\ud61c \ucd95\uc801\uc744 \ubaa8\ubc29\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 Empirical-MCTS\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "Empirical-MCTS\ub294 Pairwise-Experience-Evolutionary Meta-Prompting(PE-EMP) \ubc0f \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \uc9c0\uc5ed \ud0d0\uc0c9\uacfc \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c Empirical-MCTS\ub294 \ube44\uc815\uc801 MCTS \uc804\ub7b5\uacfc \uacbd\ud5d8 \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ub2a5\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uac80\uc0c9\uacfc \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \ucd95\uc801\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud558\uace0 \uac1c\ubc29\ub41c \ucd94\ub860 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud130\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1 \uc804\ub7b5, \ud2b9\ud788 \ubaac\ud14c \uce74\ub97c\ub85c \ud2b8\ub9ac \uac80\uc0c9(MCTS)\uc740 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ud604\uc7ac \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ube44\uc815\uc801 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0 \uc8fc\ub85c \uc9d1\uc911\ud558\uc5ec \uac01 \ubb38\uc81c \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4 \uc774\ud6c4 \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc778 \ucd94\ub860 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ubc84\ub9ac\uace0 \uc778\uac04 \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0\uc758 \ud2b9\uc131\uc778 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \uc9c0\ud61c\uc758 \ucd95\uc801\uc744 \ubaa8\ubc29\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \uc904\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ube44\uc815\uc801 \uac80\uc0c9\uc744 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ube44\ubaa8\uc218\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5 \uacfc\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub294 \uc774\uc911 \ub8e8\ud504 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Empirical-MCTS\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc9c0\uc5ed \ud0d0\uc0c9\uacfc \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc778 \uc30d \uacbd\ud5d8 \uc9c4\ud654 \uba54\ud0c0 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8(PE-EMP)\uc640 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud1b5\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Our approach models conditional distributions as piecewise-constant densities on data adaptive partitions and learns trees by directly minimizing conditional negative log-likelihood. This yields a scalable, nonparametric alternative to existing probabilistic trees that does not make parametric assumptions about the target distribution. We further introduce Partition Forests, an ensemble extension obtained by averaging conditional densities.

However, existing studies treat the entire interaction trajectories equally, overlooking the thought necessity and observation utility varies across turns. To this end, we first conduct quantitative investigations into how thought and observation affect agent effectiveness and efficiency. Based on our findings, we propose Agent-Omit, a unified training framework that empowers LLM agents to adaptively omit redundant thoughts and observations. Specifically, we first synthesize a small amount of cold-start data, including both single-turn and multi-turn omission scenarios, to fine-tune the agent for omission behaviors. Furthermore, we introduce an omit-aware agentic reinforcement learning approach, incorporating a dual sampling mechanism and a tailored omission reward to incentivize the agent's adaptive omission capability. Theoretically, we prove that the deviation of our omission policy is upper-bounded by KL-divergence. Experimental results on five agent benchmarks show that our constructed Agent-Omit-8B could obtain performance comparable to seven frontier LLM agent, and achieve the best effectiveness-efficiency trade-off than seven efficient LLM agents methods.

As new work continues to appear after publication, surveys quickly become outdated, contributing to redundancy and fragmentation in the literature. We reframe survey writing as a long-horizon maintenance problem rather than a one-time generation task, treating surveys as living documents that evolve alongside the research they describe. We propose an agentic Dynamic Survey Framework that supports the continuous updating of existing survey papers by incrementally integrating new work while preserving survey structure and minimizing unnecessary disruption. Using a retrospective experimental setup, we demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively identifies and incorporates emerging research while preserving the coherence and structure of existing surveys.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc124\ubb38 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\uc874 \uc124\ubb38\uc9c0\ub97c \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8f9\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5f0\uad6c \uacb0\uacfc\uc758 \uae09\uc18d\ud55c \uc99d\uac00\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc124\ubb38\uc9c0\ub294 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 outdated\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc5b4, \uc774\ub294 \ubb38\ud5cc\uc758 \uc911\ubcf5\uc131\uacfc \ub2e8\ud3b8\ud654\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc124\ubb38 \uc791\uc131\uc744 \uc77c\ud68c\uc131\uc774 \uc544\ub2cc \uc7a5\uae30\uc801\uc778 \uc720\uc9c0 \uad00\ub9ac \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uc124\ubb38\uc744 \ubc1c\uc804\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc11c\ub85c \uac04\uc8fc\ud558\uc5ec \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc810\uc9c4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc124\ubb38 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \uc124\ubb38\uc758 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uacfc \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc124\ubb38\uc9c0\uc758 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uc720\uc9c0\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \ubc18\uc601\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc124\ubb38 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc885\ud569\ud558\uace0 \uc870\uc9c1\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc2ec\uc801\uc778 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc5f0\uad6c \uacb0\uacfc\uc758 \uae09\uc18d\ud55c \uc99d\uac00\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uc555\ubc15\uc744 \ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc5f0\uad6c\uac00 \ucd9c\ud310 \ud6c4\uc5d0\ub3c4 \uacc4\uc18d\ud574\uc11c \ub098\ud0c0\ub098\uba74\uc11c \uc124\ubb38\uc9c0\ub294 \ube60\ub974\uac8c \uad6c\uc2dd\uc774 \ub418\uc5b4 \ubb38\ud5cc\uc758 \uc911\ubcf5\uc131\uacfc \ub2e8\ud3b8\ud654\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc124\ubb38 \uc791\uc131\uc744 \uc77c\ud68c\uc131 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc791\uc5c5\uc774 \uc544\ub2cc \uc7a5\uae30\uc801\uc778 \uc720\uc9c0 \uad00\ub9ac \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uc124\ubb38\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud558\ub294 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc640 \ud568\uaed8 \ubc1c\uc804\ud558\ub294 \uc0b4\uc544\uc788\ub294 \ubb38\uc11c\ub85c \uac04\uc8fc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \uc124\ubb38\uc9c0\ub97c \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ubcf4\uc874\ud558\uace0 \ubd88\ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc911\ub2e8\uc744 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc810\uc9c4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc124\ubb38 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud68c\uace0\uc801 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uc124\uc815\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 \uae30\uc874 \uc124\ubb38\uc758 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uacfc \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

In our approach, the sampling of training data formally corresponds to an encoding process, and the model construction to a decoding process. By leveraging finite blocklength analysis, we derive lower bounds on sample complexity and generalization error for a fixed randomized learning algorithm and its associated optimal sampling strategy. Our bounds explicitly characterize the degree of overfitting of the learning algorithm and the mismatch between its inductive bias and the task as distinct terms. This separation provides a significant advantage over existing frameworks. Additionally, we decompose the overfitting term to show its theoretical connection to existing metrics found in information-theoretic bounds and stability theory, unifying these perspectives under our proposed framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uad00\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \uc190\uc2e4 \uc555\ucd95\uc758 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0\uc11c \ud559\uc2b5 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uc720\ud55c \ube14\ub85d \uae38\uc774 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc2dc\uac01\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uae30\uc874 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc640\uc758 \ucc28\ubcc4\uc810\uc744 \ub450\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud559\uc2b5 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uc778\ucf54\ub529 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub85c, \ubaa8\ub378 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \ub514\ucf54\ub529 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub85c \uac04\uc8fc\ud558\ub294 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc720\ud55c \ube14\ub85d \uae38\uc774 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uace0\uc815\ub41c \ub79c\ub364\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uacfc \uadf8\uc5d0 \uc5f0\uad00\ub41c \ucd5c\uc801 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \uc804\ub7b5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0d8\ud50c \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uacfc \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uc624\ub958\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud558\ud55c\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc0d8\ud50c \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131 \ubc0f \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uc624\ub958\uc758 \ud558\ud55c\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uba70, \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \uacfc\uc801\ud569 \uc815\ub3c4\uc640 \uc720\ub3c4 \ud3b8\ud5a5, \uc791\uc5c5 \uac04\uc758 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub97c \uad6c\ubcc4\ud558\uc5ec \uba85\ud655\ud788 \ud45c\ud604\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uad6c\ubd84\uc740 \uae30\uc874 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc774\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uacfc\uc801\ud569 \uc6a9\uc5b4\ub97c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\ubcf4 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uacbd\uacc4\uc640 \uc548\uc815\uc131 \uc774\ub860\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uacac\ub418\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \uc9c0\ud45c\uc640\uc758 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc5f0\uacb0\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec \uc8fc\uba70, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c \ud558\uc5d0 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uad00\uc810\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uad00\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \uc190\uc2e4 \uc555\ucd95\uc758 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0\uc11c \ud559\uc2b5 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uc720\ud55c \ube14\ub85d \uae38\uc774 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uc740 \uacf5\uc2dd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ucf54\ub529 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\uc5d0 \ud574\ub2f9\ud558\uace0, \ubaa8\ub378 \uad6c\ucd95\uc740 \ub514\ucf54\ub529 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\uc5d0 \ud574\ub2f9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc720\ud55c \ube14\ub85d \uae38\uc774 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uace0\uc815\ub41c \ub79c\ub364\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \ubc0f \uadf8\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \ucd5c\uc801 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \uc804\ub7b5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0d8\ud50c \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uacfc \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uc624\ub958\uc758 \ud558\ud55c\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacbd\uacc4\ub294 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \uacfc\uc801\ud569 \uc815\ub3c4\uc640 \uadf8 \uc720\ub3c4 \ud3b8\ud5a5 \ubc0f \uc791\uc5c5 \uac04\uc758 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub97c \uad6c\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \uba85\ud655\ud55c \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uad6c\ubd84\uc740 \uae30\uc874 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc774\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac8c\ub2e4\uac00 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uacfc\uc801\ud569 \uc6a9\uc5b4\ub97c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\ubcf4 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uacbd\uacc4 \ubc0f \uc548\uc815\uc131 \uc774\ub860\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uacac\ub418\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uacfc\uc758 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc5f0\uacb0\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec \uc8fc\uc5b4 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uad00\uc810\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

We introduce ReThinker, a confidence-aware agentic framework that orchestrates retrieval, tool use, and multi-agent reasoning through a stage-wise Solver-Critic-Selector architecture. Rather than following a fixed pipeline, ReThinker dynamically allocates computation based on model confidence, enabling adaptive tool invocation, guided multi-dimensional reflection, and robust confidence-weighted selection. To support scalable training without human annotation, we further propose a reverse data synthesis pipeline and an adaptive trajectory recycling strategy that transform successful reasoning traces into high-quality supervision.

However, they mainly focus on Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs), leaving Multimodal-Attributed Graphs (MAGs) largely untapped. Developing Multimodal Graph Foundation Models (MGFMs) allows for leveraging the rich multimodal information in MAGs, and extends applicability to broader types of downstream tasks. While recent MGFMs integrate diverse modality information, our empirical investigation reveals two fundamental limitations of existing MGFMs: (1)they fail to explicitly model modality interaction, essential for capturing intricate cross-modal semantics beyond simple aggregation, and (2)they exhibit sub-optimal modality alignment, which is critical for bridging the significant semantic disparity between distinct modal spaces. To address these challenges, we propose PLANET (graPh topoLogy-aware modAlity iNteraction and alignmEnT), a novel framework employing a Divide-and-Conquer strategy to decouple modality interaction and alignment across distinct granularities. At the embedding granularity, (1)Embedding-wise Domain Gating (EDG) performs local semantic enrichment by adaptively infusing topology-aware cross-modal context, achieving modality interaction. At the node granularity, (2)Node-wise Discretization Retrieval (NDR) ensures global modality alignment by constructing a Discretized Semantic Representation Space (DSRS) to bridge modality gaps.

Despite significant leaps in visual fidelity, this approach has encountered a ``usability ceiling'' manifested as the Intent-Execution Gap (i.e., the fundamental disparity between a creator's high-level intent and the stochastic, black-box nature of current single-shot models). In this paper, inspired by the Vibe Coding, we introduce the \\textbf{Vibe AIGC}, a new paradigm for content generation via agentic orchestration, which represents the autonomous synthesis of hierarchical multi-agent workflows.\n  Under this paradigm, the user's role transcends traditional prompt engineering, evolving into a Commander who provides a Vibe, a high-level representation encompassing aesthetic preferences, functional logic, and etc. A centralized Meta-Planner then functions as a system architect, deconstructing this ``Vibe'' into executable, verifiable, and adaptive agentic pipelines. By transitioning from stochastic inference to logical orchestration, Vibe AIGC bridges the gap between human imagination and machine execution. We contend that this shift will redefine the human-AI collaborative economy, transforming AI from a fragile inference engine into a robust system-level engineering partner that democratizes the creation of complex, long-horizon digital assets.", "AI": {"tldr": "Vibe AIGC\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \uc7ac\uc815\uc758\ud558\uace0 AI\uc640 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \ud611\uc5c5\uc744 \ud601\uc2e0\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ucf58\ud150\uce20 \uc0dd\uc131 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uc0dd\uc131 AI\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc131 \ud55c\uacc4\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ucc3d\uc791\uc790\uc758 \uc758\ub3c4\uc640 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \ube44\ub86f\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "Vibe AIGC\ub294 \ub192\uc740 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ud45c\ud604\uc778 Vibe\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub97c \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud569\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud55c \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0\uc11c \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc624\ucf00\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \uc804\ud658\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\uc0c1\ub825\uacfc \uae30\uacc4\uc758 \uc2e4\ud589 \uac04\uc758 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uc18c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Vibe AIGC\ub294 AI\ub97c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uc790\uc0b0 \uc0dd\uc131\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\ub9c1 \ud30c\ud2b8\ub108\ub85c \ubcc0\ud654\uc2dc\ud0ac \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc9c0\ub09c 10\ub144 \ub3d9\uc548 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5(AI)\uc758 \uacbd\ub85c\ub294 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1 \ubc95\uce59\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc8fc\ub3c4\ub418\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc911\uc2ec \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc9c0\ubc30\ub418\uc5b4 \uc654\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \ucda9\uc2e4\ub3c4\uac00 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\uc5c8\uc74c\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \uc774 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ub2e8\uc77c \ucd2c\uc601 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 \ud2b9\uc131\uacfc \ucc3d\uc791\uc790\uc758 \uace0\uc218\uc900 \uc758\ub3c4 \uac04\uc758 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uaca9\ucc28\uc778 \uc758\ub3c4-\uc2e4\ud589 \uaca9\ucc28\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub098\ub294 ``\uc0ac\uc6a9\uc131 \ud55c\uacc4''\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 Vibe Coding\uc5d0\uc11c \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc544, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc624\ucf00\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \ucf58\ud150\uce20 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc778 \textbf{Vibe AIGC}\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc758 \uc5ed\ud560\uc740 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\ub9c1\uc744 \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\uba70, \ubbf8\uc801 \uc120\ud638\uc640 \uae30\ub2a5\uc801 \ub17c\ub9ac\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uace0\uc218\uc900 \ud45c\ud604\uc778 Vibe\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \uc9c0\ud718\uad00 \uc5ed\ud560\ub85c \uc9c4\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uc911\uc2dd \uba54\ud0c0 \ud50c\ub798\ub108\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uac74\ucd95\uac00\ub85c \uae30\ub2a5\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 'Vibe'\ub97c \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uba70 \uc801\uc751 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uccb4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud655\ub960\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0\uc11c \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc624\ucf00\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \uc804\ud658\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 Vibe AIGC\ub294 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\uc0c1\ub825\uacfc \uae30\uacc4\uc758 \uc2e4\ud589 \uac04\uc758 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uc18c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \uc804\ud658\uc774 \uc778\uac04-AI \ud611\uc5c5 \uacbd\uc81c\ub97c \uc7ac\uc815\uc758\ud558\uace0 AI\ub97c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c, \uc7a5\uae30 \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uc790\uc0b0\uc758 \ucc3d\uc791\uc744 \ubbfc\uc8fc\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\ub9c1 \ud30c\ud2b8\ub108\ub85c \ubcc0\ud654\uc2dc\ud0ac \uac83\uc774\ub77c\uace0 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, the role of the discount factor is often overlooked, as it is typically treated as a fixed parameter of the Markov decision process or tunable hyperparameter, with little consideration of its effect on the learned policy. In the literature, it is well-known that the discounting function plays a major role in characterizing time preferences of an agent, which an exponential discount factor cannot fully capture. Building on this insight, we propose a novel framework that supports flexible discounting of future rewards and optimization of risk measures in distributional RL. We provide a technical analysis of the optimality of our algorithms, show that our multi-horizon extension fixes issues raised with existing methodologies, and validate the robustness of our methods through extensive experiments. Our results highlight that discounting is a cornerstone in decision-making problems for capturing more expressive temporal and risk preferences profiles, with potential implications for real-world safety-critical applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubc30\ud3ec \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud560\uc778 \uc694\uc18c\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8e8\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \uc720\uc5f0\ud558\uac8c \uc870\uc815\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc548\uc804-critical\ud55c \uc601\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c \uc704\ud5d8 \uac10\uc218 \ubaa9\uc801\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc30\ud3ec \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131.", "method": "\ubbf8\ub798 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc758 \uc720\uc5f0\ud55c \ud560\uc778\uacfc \uc704\ud5d8 \uce21\uc815 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801\uc131\uc744 \uae30\uc220\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uae30\uac04 \ud655\uc7a5\uc774 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\uae30\ub41c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uace0, \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uacb0\uc815 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud560\uc778 \uc694\uc18c\uac00 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \ubc0f \uc704\ud5d8 \uc120\ud638 \ud504\ub85c\ud30c\uc77c\uc744 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc798 \ucea1\ucc98\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc694\uc18c\uc784\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70, \uc2e4\uc81c \uc548\uc804-critical\ud55c \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ub17c\uc758\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubc30\ud3ec \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc740 \uc704\ud5d8 \ubbfc\uac10 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc548\uc804-critical \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc774 \ucc44\ud0dd\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ud560\uc778 \uc694\uc18c\uc758 \uc5ed\ud560\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815\uc758 \uace0\uc815\ub41c \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \ub610\ub294 \uc870\uc815 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130\ub85c \ucc98\ub9ac\ub418\ubbc0\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \uc815\ucc45\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uac70\uc758 \uace0\ub824\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubb38\ud5cc\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud560\uc778 \ud568\uc218\uac00 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc120\ud638\ub97c \ud2b9\uc131\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc798 \uc54c\ub824\uc838 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc9c0\uc218 \ud560\uc778 \uc694\uc18c\ub85c\ub294 \uc644\uc804\ud788 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubbf8\ub798 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc758 \uc720\uc5f0\ud55c \ud560\uc778\uacfc \ubc30\ud3ec RL\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc704\ud5d8 \uce21\uc815 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uae30\uc220\uc801 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0, \ub2e4\uc911 \uae30\uac04 \ud655\uc7a5\uc774 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\uae30\ub41c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ud560\uc778 \uc694\uc18c\uac00 \ub354 \ud45c\ud604\ub825\uc774 \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \ubc0f \uc704\ud5d8 \uc120\ud638 \ud504\ub85c\ud30c\uc77c\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uacb0\uc815 \ubb38\uc81c\uc758 \ucd08\uc11d\uc784\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70, \uc2e4\uc81c \uc548\uc804-critical \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \ud568\uc758\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

We identify the root cause of this degradation as the non-negativity constraint imposed on kernel feature maps: standard projections like ReLU act as \"passive truncation\" operators, indiscriminately discarding semantic information residing in the negative domain. We propose MirrorLA, a geometric framework that substitutes passive truncation with active reorientation. By leveraging learnable Householder reflections, MirrorLA rotates the feature geometry into the non-negative orthant to maximize information retention. Our approach restores representational density through a cohesive, multi-scale design: it first optimizes local discriminability via block-wise isometries, stabilizes long-context dynamics using variance-aware modulation to diversify activations, and finally, integrates dispersed subspaces via cross-head reflections to induce global covariance mixing. MirrorLA achieves state-of-the-art performance across standard benchmarks, demonstrating that strictly linear efficiency can be achieved without compromising representational fidelity.", "AI": {"tldr": "MirrorLA\ub294 Transformers\uc758 \uc120\ud615 \uc8fc\uc758 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc120\ud615 \uc8fc\uc758 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774 Transformer\uc758 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uae30\ub294 \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ub0ae\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc744 \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud754\ud788 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 ReLU\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ud45c\uc900 \ud504\ub85c\uc81d\uc158 \ub300\uc2e0 \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\uc874\uc744 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc30\uc6b8 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 Householder \ubc18\uc0ac\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "MirrorLA\ub294 \uc9c0\uc5ed \ucc28\ubcc4\uc131\uacfc \uc7a5\uae30 \ub9e5\ub77d \uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uace0 \ucd5c\uc885\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uacf5\ubd84\uc0b0 \ud63c\ud569\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "MirrorLA\ub294 \ub300\ud45c\uc801\uc778 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uadf8\ub300\ub85c \uc120\ud615 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ud45c\ud604 \ucda9\uc2e4\ub3c4\ub97c \uc800\ud558\uc2dc\ud0a4\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0\ub3c4 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc120\ud615 \uc8fc\uc758\ub294 Transformer\uc758 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uacf1\uc5d0\uc11c \uc120\ud615\uc73c\ub85c \ud06c\uac8c \uc904\uc5ec \uc8fc\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc131\ub2a5\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\ub9e5\uc2a4 \uae30\ubc18 \uc8fc\uc758 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc5d0 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub4a4\uccd0\uc9d1\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc800\ud558\uc758 \uadfc\ubcf8 \uc6d0\uc778\uc744 \ucee4\ub110 \ud53c\ucc98 \ub9f5\uc5d0 \ubd80\uacfc\ub41c \ube44\ubd80\uc815\uc131 \uc81c\uc57d\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc778\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud45c\uc900 \ud22c\uc601\uc740 ReLU\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \"\uc218\ub3d9\uc801 \uc808\ub2e8\" \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc790\ub85c \uc791\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubd80\uc815 \uc601\uc5ed\uc5d0 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\ub294 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uac00\ucc28\uc5c6\uc774 \ud3d0\uae30\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc218\ub3d9\uc801 \uc808\ub2e8\uc744 \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \ub300\uccb4\ud558\ub294 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 MirrorLA\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubc30\uc6b8 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 Householder \ubc18\uc0ac\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec MirrorLA\ub294 \ud53c\ucc98 \uae30\ud558\uad6c\uc131\uc744 \ube44\ubd80\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc0ac\ubd84\uba74\uc73c\ub85c \ud68c\uc804\uc2dc\ucf1c \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\uc874\uc744 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uc751\uc9d1\ub825 \uc788\uace0 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c \ub514\uc790\uc778\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud45c\ud604 \ubc00\ub3c4\ub97c \ubcf5\uc6d0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\uc120 \ube14\ub85d \ub2e8\uc704 \ub4f1\uac70\ub9ac \ubcc0\ud658\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc9c0\uc5ed \ucc28\ubcc4\uc131\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uace0, \ud65c\uc131\ud654\ub97c \ub2e4\uc591\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc778\uc2dd \uc870\uc808\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc7a5\uae30 \ub9e5\ub77d \uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uc548\uc815\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba70, \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c \uad50\ucc28 \ud5e4\ub4dc \ubc18\uc0ac\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud769\uc5b4\uc9c4 \ubd80\ubd84 \uacf5\uac04\ub4e4\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uacf5\ubd84\uc0b0 \ud63c\ud569\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Reported studies demonstrate competence on various tasks ranging from EHR analysis and differential diagnosis to treatment planning and research workflows. Yet the literature largely consists of overviews which are either broad surveys or narrow dives into a single capability (e.g., memory, planning, reasoning), leaving healthcare work without a common frame. We address this by reviewing 49 studies using a seven-dimensional taxonomy: Cognitive Capabilities, Knowledge Management, Interaction Patterns, Adaptation & Learning, Safety & Ethics, Framework Typology and Core Tasks & Subtasks with 29 operational sub-dimensions. Using explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria and a labeling rubric (Fully Implemented, Partially Implemented, Not Implemented), we map each study to the taxonomy and report quantitative summaries of capability prevalence and co-occurrence patterns. Our empirical analysis surfaces clear asymmetries. For instance, the External Knowledge Integration sub-dimension under Knowledge Management is commonly realized (~76% Fully Implemented) whereas Event-Triggered Activation sub-dimenison under Interaction Patterns is largely absent (~92% Not Implemented) and Drift Detection & Mitigation sub-dimension under Adaptation & Learning is rare (~98% Not Implemented). Architecturally, Multi-Agent Design sub-dimension under Framework Typology is the dominant pattern (~82% Fully Implemented) while orchestration layers remain mostly partial. Across Core Tasks & Subtasks, information centric capabilities lead e.g., Medical Question Answering & Decision Support and Benchmarking & Simulation, while action and discovery oriented areas such as Treatment Planning & Prescription still show substantial gaps (~59% Not Implemented).", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc758\ub8cc \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c

The core idea lies in effectively aligning the modality between natural language and time series. However, the multi-scale structures of natural language and time series have not been fully considered, resulting in insufficient utilization of LLMs capabilities. To this end, we propose MSH-LLM, a Multi-Scale Hypergraph method that aligns Large Language Models for time series analysis. Specifically, a hyperedging mechanism is designed to enhance the multi-scale semantic information of time series semantic space. Then, a cross-modality alignment (CMA) module is introduced to align the modality between natural language and time series at different scales. In addition, a mixture of prompts (MoP) mechanism is introduced to provide contextual information and enhance the ability of LLMs to understand the multi-scale temporal patterns of time series.

However, collecting new labelled data at each time step remains expensive and logistically difficult, especially in dynamic or remote ecological systems. As a response to this challenge, we demonstrate that a model with access to reference data solely from time step t0 can perform competitively on both t0 and a future time step t1, outperforming models trained separately on time-specific reference data (the gold standard). This finding suggests that effective temporal generalization can be achieved without requiring manual updates to reference labels beyond the initial time step t0. Drawing on concepts from change detection and semi-supervised learning (SSL), the most performant approach, \"Common Ground\", uses a semi-supervised framework that leverages temporally stable regions-areas with little to no change in spectral or semantic characteristics between time steps-as a source of implicit supervision for dynamic regions. We evaluate this strategy across multiple classifiers, sensors (Landsat-8, Sentinel-2 satellite multispectral and airborne imaging spectroscopy), and ecological use cases. For invasive tree species mapping, we observed a 21-40% improvement in classification accuracy using Common Ground compared to naive temporal transfer, where models trained at a single time step are directly applied to a future time step. We also observe a 10 -16% higher accuracy for the introduced approach compared to a gold-standard approach. In contrast, when broad land cover categories were mapped across Europe, we observed a more modest 2% increase in accuracy compared to both the naive and gold-standard approaches.

We introduce Group-Evolving Agents (GEA), a new paradigm for open-ended self-improvements, which treats a group of agents as the fundamental evolutionary unit, enabling explicit experience sharing and reuse within the group throughout evolution. Unlike existing open-ended self-evolving paradigms that adopt tree-structured evolution, GEA overcomes the limitation of inefficient utilization of exploratory diversity caused by isolated evolutionary branches. We evaluate GEA on challenging coding benchmarks, where it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art self-evolving methods (71.0% vs. 56.7% on SWE-bench Verified, 88.3% vs. 68.3% on Polyglot) and matches or exceeds top human-designed agent frameworks (71.8% and 52.0% on two benchmarks, respectively). Analysis reveals that GEA more effectively converts early-stage exploratory diversity into sustained, long-term progress, achieving stronger performance under the same number of evolved agents. Furthermore, GEA exhibits consistent transferability across different coding models and greater robustness, fixing framework-level bugs in 1.4 iterations on average, versus 5 for self-evolving methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "GEA\ub294 \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uad6c\uc870 \uc218\uc815\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uadf8\ub8f9\uc73c\ub85c, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud55c\uc815\ub41c \uc9c4\ud654 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\uc5ec \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc778\uac04 \uac1c\uc785\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uc218\uc815\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "GEA\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uadf8\ub8f9\uc744 \uae30\ubcf8 \uc9c4\ud654 \ub2e8\uc704\ub85c \uc0bc\uc544 \uadf8\ub8f9 \ub0b4 \uacbd\ud5d8 \uacf5\uc720 \ubc0f \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc9c4\ud654 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "GEA\ub294 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc790\uac00 \uc9c4\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud6e8\uc52c \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec \uc8fc\uba70(\uc608: SWE-bench Verified\uc5d0\uc11c 71.0% \ub300 56.7%), \uc0c1\uc704 \uc778\uac04 \uc124\uacc4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc640 \ube44\uc2b7\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \uae30\ub85d\ud55c\ub2e4(\uac01\uac01 71.8%\uc640 52.0%).", "conclusion": "GEA\ub294 \ucd08\uae30 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc801 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uc7a5\uae30 \ubc1c\uc804\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\ud658\ud558\uc5ec \ub354 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ucf54\ub529 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uc804\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uace0 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c \ub808\ubca8\uc758 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \ud3c9\uade0 1.4\ubc88\uc758 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc624\ud508 \uc5d4\ub514\ub4dc \uc790\uae30 \uac1c\uc120 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \uc218\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ud558\uace0 \ubbf8\ub9ac \uc815\uc758\ub41c \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc778\uac04 \uac1c\uc785\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \uc904\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uadf8\ub8f9\uc744 \uae30\ubcf8 \uc9c4\ud654 \ub2e8\uc704\ub85c \ucde8\uae09\ud558\uc5ec \uc9c4\ud654 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uadf8\ub8f9 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uacbd\ud5d8\uc744 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uacf5\uc720\ud558\uace0 \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uc624\ud508 \uc5d4\ub514\ub4dc \uc790\uae30 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc778 \uadf8\ub8f9 \uc9c4\ud654 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8(GEA)\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub098\ubb34 \uad6c\uc870 \uc9c4\ud654\ub97c \ucc44\ud0dd\ud55c \uc624\ud508 \uc5d4\ub514\ub4dc \uc790\uae30 \uc9c4\ud654 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uacfc \ub2ec\ub9ac, GEA\ub294 \uaca9\ub9ac\ub41c \uc9c4\ud654 \ubd84\uae30\uac00 \ucd08\ub798\ud558\ub294 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131 \ud65c\uc6a9\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

In this work, we propose two simple techniques to improve policy gradient algorithms for LLMs. First, we replace the fixed anchor policy during RL with an Exponential Moving Average (EMA), similar to a target network in deep Q-learning. Second, we introduce Top-k KL estimator, which allows for flexible interpolation between exact KL and sampled KL. We derive the stability conditions for using EMA anchor; moreover, we show that our Top-k KL estimator yields both unbiased KL values and unbiased gradients at any k, while bringing the benefits of exact KL. When combined with GRPO, the two techniques (EMA-PG) lead to a significant performance boost. On math reasoning, it allows R1-distilled Qwen-1.5B to reach 53.9% on OlympiadBench compared to 50.8% by GRPO. On agentic RL domains, with Qwen-3B base, EMA-PG improves GRPO by an average of 33.3% across 7 datasets of Q&A with search engines, including 29.7% $\\rightarrow$ 44.1% on HotpotQA, 27.4% $\\rightarrow$ 40.1% on 2WikiMultiHopQA.

In this work, we study the automated design of agentic systems that remain safe even when a subset of agents is compromised. We formalize this challenge as a Stackelberg security game between a system designer (the Meta-Agent) and a best-responding Meta-Adversary that selects and compromises a subset of agents to minimize safety. We propose Meta-Adversary-Meta-Agent (MaMa), a novel algorithm for approximately solving this game and automatically designing safe agentic systems. Our approach uses LLM-based adversarial search, where the Meta-Agent iteratively proposes system designs and receives feedback based on the strongest attacks discovered by the Meta-Adversary. Empirical evaluations across diverse environments show that systems designed with MaMa consistently defend against worst-case attacks while maintaining performance comparable to systems optimized solely for task success. Moreover, the resulting systems generalize to stronger adversaries, as well as ones with different attack objectives or underlying LLMs, demonstrating robust safety beyond the training setting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uac1c\ubcc4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc2e4\ud328\ub098 \uc801\ub300\uc801\uc778 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc790\ub3d9 \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc778\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uac1c\ubcc4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc2e4\ud328\ub098 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc548\uc804 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "Meta-Adversary-Meta-Agent (MaMa)\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec Stackelberg \ubcf4\uc548 \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \uadfc\uc0ac\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc124\uacc4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "MaMa\ub85c \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ucd5c\uc545\uc758 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ubc29\uc5b4\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc131\uacf5\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub41c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uacfc \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uacb0\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ub354 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc801\uacfc \ud568\uaed8 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uacf5\uaca9 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub098 \uae30\ubcf8 LLM\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uc801\uc5d0\uac8c\ub3c4 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub418\uc5b4 \ud6c8\ub828 \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \ub118\uc5b4\uc120 \uacac\uace0\ud55c \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc778\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uac1c\ubcc4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc2e4\ud328\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc801\ub300\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud589\ub3d9\ud560 \ub54c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc548\uc804 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc77c\ubd80 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc190\uc0c1\ub41c \uacbd\uc6b0\uc5d0\ub3c4 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc774 \uc720\uc9c0\ub418\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc790\ub3d9 \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc124\uacc4\uc790(\uba54\ud0c0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8)\uc640 \ucd5c\uc801 \ubc18\uc751 \uba54\ud0c0 \uc801\ub300\uc790 \uac04\uc758 \uc2a4\ud0dd\ucf08\ubc84\uadf8 \ubcf4\uc548 \uac8c\uc784\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\uc2dd\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uba54\ud0c0 \uc801\ub300\uc790\uac00 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc77c\ubd80 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\uace0 \uc190\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \uadfc\uc0ac\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc778 \uba54\ud0c0 \uc801\ub300\uc790-\uba54\ud0c0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8(MaMa)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uba54\ud0c0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0 \uba54\ud0c0 \uc801\ub300\uc790\uac00 \ubc1c\uacac\ud55c \ucd5c\uac15\uc758 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uc5ec \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \ubc1b\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc2e4\uc99d\uc801 \ud3c9\uac00 \uacb0\uacfc, MaMa\ub85c \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ucd5c\uc545\uc758 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ubc29\uc5b4\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc791\uc5c5 \uc131\uacf5\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ub2e8\ub3c5\uc73c\ub85c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub41c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uacfc \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub354\uc6b1\uc774, \uacb0\uacfc\ub85c \uc5bb\uc740 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ub354 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc801\ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \uacf5\uaca9 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub098 \uae30\ubc18 LLM\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \uc801\uc5d0\uac8c\ub3c4 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub418\uc5b4 \ud6c8\ub828 \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \ub118\uc5b4\uc11c\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

We define an action in deployment to be perfectly rational if it maximises the hidden true value function in the steepest direction. The expected value discrepancy of a policy's actions against their rational counterparts, culminating over the trajectory in deployment, is defined to be expected rational risk; an empirical average version in training is also defined. Their difference, termed as rational risk gap, is decomposed into (1) an extrinsic component caused by environment shifts between training and deployment, and (2) an intrinsic one due to the algorithm's generalisability in a dynamic environment. They are upper bounded by, respectively, (1) the $1$-Wasserstein distance between transition kernels and initial state distributions in training and deployment, and (2) the empirical Rademacher complexity of the value function class. Our theory suggests hypotheses on the benefits from regularisers (including layer normalisation, $\\ell_2$ regularisation, and weight normalisation) and domain randomisation, as well as the harm from environment shifts. Experiments are in full agreement with these hypotheses.

Existing multi-agent collaboration frameworks typically reason at the agent level, assume homogeneous sensing, and handle uncertainty implicitly, limiting robustness under sensor corruption. We propose Active Asymmetric Multi-Agent Multimodal Learning under Uncertainty (A2MAML), a principled approach for uncertainty-aware, modality-level collaboration. A2MAML models each modality-specific feature as a stochastic estimate with uncertainty prediction, actively selects reliable agent-modality pairs, and aggregates information via Bayesian inverse-variance weighting. This formulation enables fine-grained, modality-level fusion, supports asymmetric modality availability, and provides a principled mechanism to suppress corrupted or noisy modalities. Extensive experiments on connected autonomous driving scenarios for collaborative accident detection demonstrate that A2MAML consistently outperforms both single-agent and collaborative baselines, achieving up to 18.7% higher accident detection rate.", "AI": {"tldr": "A2MAML\uc740 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uc778\uc2dd\ud558\uace0 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0 \uc218\uc900\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud611\ub825\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc73c\ub85c, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc13c\uc11c\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud611\uc5c5 \uc0ac\uace0 \uac10\uc9c0\uc5d0\uc11c 18.7% \ub192\uc740 \uc0ac\uace0 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uc728\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc13c\uc11c\ub97c \uac16\ucd98 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\ub098, \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0 \ud2b9\uc815 \ubc0f \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc758\uc874\uc801 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc774 \uc874\uc7ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "A2MAML\uc740 \uac01 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc608\uce21\uacfc \ud568\uaed8 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \ucd94\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uace0, \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8-\ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0 \uc30d\uc744 \uc801\uadf9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\uba70, \ubca0\uc774esian \uc5ed\ubd84\uc0b0 \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc9d1\uacc4\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "A2MAML\uc740 \ud611\uc5c5 \uc0ac\uace0 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubc0f \ud611\ub825\uc801 \uae30\uc900\uc120\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud56d\uc0c1 \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70 \ucd5c\ub300 18.7% \ub192\uc740 \uc0ac\uace0 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uc728\uc744 \uae30\ub85d\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "A2MAML\uc740 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uc778\uc2dd\ud558\ub294 \ud611\ub825\uc801 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c, \uc190\uc0c1\ub418\uac70\ub098 \uc7a1\uc74c\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\ub97c \uc5b5\uc81c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc6d0\uce59\uc801\uc778 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \uc13c\uc11c\ub85c \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uc7a5\ucc29\ub418\uc5b4 \ub354 \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \uc778\uc2dd\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubaa8\ub4dc\ubcc4 \ubc0f \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc758\uc874\uc801\uc778 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud611\uc5c5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc218\uc900\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd94\ub860\ud558\uace0 \ub3d9\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uac10\uc9c0\ub97c \uac00\uc815\ud558\uba70 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uc554\ubb35\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uc5ec \uc13c\uc11c \uc190\uc0c1 \uc2dc \uac15\uc778\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uc778\uc2dd\ud55c \ubaa8\ub4dc \uc218\uc900 \ud611\uc5c5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc6d0\uce59\uc801\uc778 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc778 Active Asymmetric Multi-Agent Multimodal Learning under Uncertainty (A2MAML)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

These agents are typically trained in cyber gym environments using dense, highly engineered reward functions which combine many penalties and incentives for a range of (un)desirable states and costly actions. Dense rewards help alleviate the challenge of exploring complex environments but risk biasing agents towards suboptimal and potentially riskier solutions, a critical issue in complex cyber environments. We thoroughly evaluate the impact of reward function structure on learning and policy behavioural characteristics using a variety of sparse and dense reward functions, two well-established cyber gyms, a range of network sizes, and both policy gradient and value-based RL algorithms. Our evaluation is enabled by a novel ground truth evaluation approach which allows directly comparing between different reward functions, illuminating the nuanced inter-relationships between rewards, action space and the risks of suboptimal policies in cyber environments. Our results show that sparse rewards, provided they are goal aligned and can be encountered frequently, uniquely offer both enhanced training reliability and more effective cyber defence agents with lower-risk policies. Surprisingly, sparse rewards can also yield policies that are better aligned with cyber defender goals and make sparing use of costly defensive actions without explicit reward-based numerical penalties.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc790\uc728 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud6c8\ub828\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\ub85c, \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218

We present STREAM-RL, a unified framework that introduces three novel algorithmic contributions: (1) PU-GAT+, an Uncertainty-Guided Adaptive Conformal Forecaster that uses prediction uncertainty to dynamically reweight graph attention via confidence-monotonic attention, achieving distribution-free coverage guarantees; (2) CRFN-BY, a Conformal Residual Flow Network that models uncertainty-normalized residuals via normalizing flows with Benjamini-Yekutieli FDR control under arbitrary dependence; and (3) LyCon-WRL+, an Uncertainty-Guided Safe World-Model RL agent with Lyapunov stability certificates, certified Lipschitz bounds, and uncertainty-propagated imagination rollouts. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to propagate calibrated uncertainty from forecasting through anomaly detection to safe policy learning with end-to-end theoretical guarantees. Experiments on multiple real-world traffic trajectory data demonstrate that STREAM-RL achieves 91.4\\% coverage efficiency, controls FDR at 4.1\\% under verified dependence, and improves safety rate to 95.2\\% compared to 69\\% for standard PPO while achieving higher reward, with 23ms end-to-end inference latency.", "AI": {"tldr": "STREAM-RL\uc740 \ub3c4\uc2dc \uad50\ud1b5 \uad00\ub9ac\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc608\uce21, \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0, \uc548\uc804\ud55c \uc218\uc815 \uc870\uce58\ub97c \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uba70 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub3c4\uc2dc \uad50\ud1b5 \uad00\ub9ac\ub294 \ubbf8\ub798 \uc870\uac74\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\uace0, \uc774\uc0c1 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\uba70, \uc548\uc804\ud55c \uc218\uc815 \uc870\uce58\ub97c \ucde8\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "STREAM-RL\uc740 PU-GAT+, CRFN-BY, LyCon-WRL+\ub77c\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud601\uc2e0\uc801\uc778 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \uae30\uc5ec\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "STREAM-RL\uc740 91.4%\uc758 \ubc94\uc704 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uac80\uc99d\ub41c \uc758\uc874\uc131 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c 4.1%\uc758 FDR\uc744 \uc81c\uc5b4\ud558\uba70, \ud45c\uc900 PPO\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc548\uc804\uc131 \ube44\uc728\uc744 69%\uc5d0\uc11c 95.2%\ub85c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uba70 \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0, \uc548\uc804\ud55c \uc815\ucc45 \ud559\uc2b5\uae4c\uc9c0 \ubcf4\uc815\ub41c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uc804\ud30c\ud558\ub294 \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub3c4\uc2dc \uad50\ud1b5 \uad00\ub9ac\ub294 \ubbf8\ub798 \uc870\uac74\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\uace0, \uc774\uc0c1\uc744 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\uba70, \uc548\uc804\ud55c \uc218\uc815 \uc870\uce58\ub97c \ucde8\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc608\uce21 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc8fc\uc758\ub97c \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\uc2dc \uac00\uc911\uce58 \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 PU-GAT+, \uc784\uc758 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 Benjamini-Yekutieli FDR \uc81c\uc5b4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uc815\uaddc\ud654\ud55c \uc794\uc5ec\ub97c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 CRFN-BY, \ub9ac\ud504\uc288\uc704\uce20 \uacbd\uacc4\uc640 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc804\ud30c \uc0c1\uc0c1\uc758 \ub864\uc544\uc6c3\uc774 \uc778\uc99d\ub41c \uc548\uc815\uc131 \uc99d\uba85\uc11c\ub97c \uac16\ucd98 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378 RL \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc778 LyCon-WRL+\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c STREAM-RL\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uac00 \uc544\ub294 \ud55c, \uc774\ub294 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0, \uc548\uc804\ud55c \uc815\ucc45 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0 \uc774\ub974\ub294 \ubcf4\uc815\ub41c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uc804\ud30c\ud558\ub294 \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc2e4\uc138\uacc4 \uad50\ud1b5 \uada4\uc801 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c STREAM-RL\uc740 91.4%\uc758 \ubc94\uc704 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uac80\uc99d\ub41c \uc758\uc874\uc131 \uc544\ub798\uc5d0\uc11c 4.1%\uc758 FDR\uc744 \uc81c\uc5b4\ud558\uba70, \ud45c\uc900 PPO\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc548\uc804\uc131 \ube44\uc728\uc744 69%\uc5d0\uc11c 95.2%\ub85c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0, \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba74\uc11c 23ms\uc758 \uc885\ub2e8 \uac04 \ucd94\ub860 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc744 \uac00\uc9d1\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark suite for CRL based on realistically simulated robots in the Gazebo simulator. Our Continual Robotic Simulation Suite (CRoSS) benchmarks rely on two robotic platforms: a two-wheeled differential-drive robot with lidar, camera and bumper sensor, and a robotic arm with seven joints. The former represent an agent in line-following and object-pushing scenarios, where variation of visual and structural parameters yields a large number of distinct tasks, whereas the latter is used in two goal-reaching scenarios with high-level cartesian hand position control (modeled after the Continual World benchmark), and low-level control based on joint angles. For the robotic arm benchmarks, we provide additional kinematics-only variants that bypass the need for physical simulation (as long as no sensor readings are required), and which can be run two orders of magnitude faster. CRoSS is designed to be easily extensible and enables controlled studies of continual reinforcement learning in robotic settings with high physical realism, and in particular allow the use of almost arbitrary simulated sensors. To ensure reproducibility and ease of use, we provide a containerized setup (Apptainer) that runs out-of-the-box, and report performances of standard RL algorithms, including Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and policy gradient methods.
