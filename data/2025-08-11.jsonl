Yet a collection of safe agents does not guarantee a safe\ncollection of agents, as interactions between agents over time create emergent\nbehaviours and induce novel failure modes. This means multi-agent systems\nrequire a fundamentally different risk analysis approach than that used for a\nsingle agent.\n  This report addresses the early stages of risk identification and analysis\nfor multi-agent AI systems operating within governed environments where\norganisations control their agent configurations and deployment. In this\nsetting, we examine six critical failure modes: cascading reliability failures,\ninter-agent communication failures, monoculture collapse, conformity bias,\ndeficient theory of mind, and mixed motive dynamics. For each, we provide a\ntoolkit for practitioners to extend or integrate into their existing frameworks\nto assess these failure modes within their organisational contexts.\n  Given fundamental limitations in current LLM behavioural understanding, our\napproach centres on analysis validity, and advocates for progressively\nincreasing validity through staged testing across stages of abstraction and\ndeployment that gradually increases exposure to potential negative impacts,\nwhile collecting convergent evidence through simulation, observational\nanalysis, benchmarking, and red teaming. This methodology establishes the\ngroundwork for robust organisational risk management as these LLM-based\nmulti-agent systems are deployed and operated."}

Traditional rule-based systems and\nnumerical optimization approaches often struggle with the scale, dynamics, and\nadaptability required by modern power networks. This paper introduces\nGrid-Agent, an autonomous, AI-driven framework that combines Large Language\nModels (LLMs) with multi-agent reinforcement learning to detect and remediate\ngrid violations in real time. Grid-Agent integrates semantic reasoning with\nnumerical precision through a modular agent architecture: a planning agent\ngenerates coordinated action sequences using numerical power flow solvers,\nwhile a validation agent evaluates system stability and action effectiveness\nvia sandboxed execution with safety rollbacks. To ensure scalability,\nGrid-Agent incorporates an adaptive multiscale network representation that\ndynamically selects optimal encoding schemes based on network size and\ncomplexity. The framework enables coordinated violation resolution through\noptimizing switch configurations, battery deployment, and load curtailment\nstrategies. Experimental results in standard IEEE and CIGRE test systems (IEEE\n69-bus, CIGRE MV, and IEEE 30-bus) demonstrate superior violation mitigation\nperformance. Additionally, the framework's built-in data collection and\nlearning capabilities enable continuous learning and adaptation to diverse\nnetwork topologies. The autonomous nature of the framework makes it\nparticularly suitable for modern smart grid applications requiring rapid\nresponse to dynamic operating conditions."}

This paper presents a comparative framework for analyzing\nblockchain-based E-Voting architectures, consensus mechanisms, and\ncryptographic protocols. We examine the limitations of prevalent models like\nProof of Work, Proof of Stake, and Delegated Proof of Stake, and propose\noptimization strategies that include hybrid consensus, lightweight\ncryptography, and decentralized identity management. Additionally, we explore\nthe novel role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in smart contract generation,\nanomaly detection, and user interaction. Our findings offer a foundation for\ndesigning secure, scalable, and intelligent blockchain-based E-Voting systems\nsuitable for national-scale deployment. This work lays the groundwork for\nbuilding an end-to-end blockchain E-Voting prototype enhanced by LLM-guided\nsmart contract generation and validation, supported by a systematic framework\nand simulation-based analysis."}

We define this problem as Partial Feature Membership Inference (PFMI).\nTo address this problem, we propose MRAD (Memory-guided Reconstruction and\nAnomaly Detection), a two-stage attack framework. In the first stage, MRAD\noptimizes the unknown feature values to minimize the loss of the sample. In the\nsecond stage, it measures the deviation between the reconstructed sample and\nthe training distribution using anomaly detection. Empirical results\ndemonstrate that MRAD is effective across a range of datasets, and maintains\ncompatibility with various off-the-shelf anomaly detection techniques.

Inspired by the issue, this paper\nproposes a novel Graph Federated Learning for Personalized Privacy\nRecommendation (GFed-PP) that adapts to different privacy requirements while\nimproving recommendation performance. GFed-PP incorporates the interaction data\nof public users to build a user-item interaction graph, which is then used to\nform a user relationship graph. A lightweight graph convolutional network (GCN)\nis employed to learn each user's user-specific personalized item embedding. To\nprotect user privacy, each client learns the user embedding and the scoring\nfunction locally. Additionally, GFed-PP achieves optimization of the federated\nrecommendation framework through the initialization of item embedding on\nclients and the aggregation of the user relationship graph on the server.\nExperimental results demonstrate that GFed-PP significantly outperforms\nexisting methods for five datasets, offering superior recommendation accuracy\nwithout compromising privacy. This framework provides a practical solution for\naccommodating varying privacy preferences in federated recommendation systems."}

Recent advances\nin large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved translation\naccuracy, however, these methods all require that the target database is\npre-specified. This becomes problematic in scenarios with multiple extensive\ndatabases, where identifying the correct database becomes a crucial yet\noverlooked step. In this paper, we propose a three-stage end-to-end text-to-SQL\nframework to identify the user's intended database before generating SQL\nqueries. Our approach leverages LLMs and prompt engineering to extract implicit\ninformation from natural language queries (NLQs) in the form of a ruleset. We\nthen train a large db\\_id prediction model, which includes a RoBERTa-based\nfinetuned encoder, to predict the correct Database identifier (db\\_id) based on\nboth the NLQ and the LLM-generated rules. Finally, we refine the generated SQL\nby using critic agents to correct errors. Experimental results demonstrate that\nour framework outperforms the current state-of-the-art models in both database\nintent prediction and SQL generation accuracy."}

In this paper, we present ScamAgent, an autonomous multi-turn agent\nbuilt on top of LLMs, capable of generating highly realistic scam call scripts\nthat simulate real-world fraud scenarios. Unlike prior work focused on\nsingle-shot prompt misuse, ScamAgent maintains dialogue memory, adapts\ndynamically to simulated user responses, and employs deceptive persuasion\nstrategies across conversational turns. We show that current LLM safety\nguardrails, including refusal mechanisms and content filters, are ineffective\nagainst such agent-based threats. Even models with strong prompt-level\nsafeguards can be bypassed when prompts are decomposed, disguised, or delivered\nincrementally within an agent framework. We further demonstrate the\ntransformation of scam scripts into lifelike voice calls using modern\ntext-to-speech systems, completing a fully automated scam pipeline. Our\nfindings highlight an urgent need for multi-turn safety auditing, agent-level\ncontrol frameworks, and new methods to detect and disrupt conversational\ndeception powered by generative AI."}
