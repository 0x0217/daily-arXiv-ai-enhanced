We outline a stepwise governance framework that evolves from human led evaluations to fully autonomous, AI-driven processes. By decomposing decisions into weighted, criterion based evaluations, the QOC model enhances transparency, fairness, and explainability in DAO voting. We demonstrate how large language models (LLMs) and stakeholder aligned AI agents can support or automate evaluations, while statistical safeguards help detect manipulation. The proposed framework lays the foundation for scalable and trustworthy governance in the Web3 ecosystem.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud0c8\uc911\uc559\ud654 \uc790\uc728 \uc870\uc9c1(DAO)\uc5d0\uc11c \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "DAO\uc758 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0 \ud22c\uba85\uc131\uacfc \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud544\uc694\uc131.", "method": "\uc9c8\ubb38-\uc635\uc158-\uae30\uc900(QOC) \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \ub2e8\uacc4\uc801 \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c.", "result": "QOC \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 DAO \ud22c\ud45c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud22c\uba85\uc131, \uacf5\uc815\uc131 \ubc0f \uc124\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0, \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uacfc \uc774\ud574\uad00\uacc4\uc790\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucd98 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90c.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 Web3 \uc0dd\ud0dc\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud1a0\ub300\ub97c \ub9c8\ub828\ud568.", "translated_summary": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc9c8\ubb38-\uc635\uc158-\uae30\uc900(QOC) \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud1b5\ud569\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud0c8\uc911\uc559\ud654 \uc790\uc728 \uc870\uc9c1(DAO)\uc5d0\uc11c \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc778\uac04 \uc8fc\ub3c4\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0\uc11c \uc644\uc804 \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc778 AI \uae30\ubc18 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub85c \uc9c4\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc801 \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \uac1c\uc694\ub97c \uc124\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uac00\uc911\uce58\uac00 \ubd80\uc5ec\ub41c \uae30\uc900 \uae30\ubc18 \ud3c9\uac00\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 QOC \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 DAO \ud22c\ud45c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud22c\uba85\uc131, \uacf5\uc815\uc131 \ubc0f \uc124\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uacfc \uc774\ud574 \uad00\uacc4\uc790 \ub9de\ucda4\ud615 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \uc548\uc804 \uc7a5\uce58\uac00 \uc870\uc791\uc744 \uac10\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc744 \uc904 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc2dc\uc5f0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 Web3 \uc0dd\ud0dc\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud1a0\ub300\ub97c \ub9c8\ub828\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

To be published in the Proceedings of Machine Learning Research (PMLR)", "summary": "Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning for autonomous cyber defence have resulted in agents that can successfully defend simulated computer networks against cyber-attacks. However, many of these agents would need retraining to defend networks with differing topology or size, making them poorly suited to real-world networks where topology and size can vary over time. In this research we introduce a novel set of Topological Extensions for Reinforcement Learning Agents (TERLA) that provide generalisability for the defence of networks with differing topology and size, without the need for retraining. Our approach involves the use of heterogeneous graph neural network layers to produce a fixed-size latent embedding representing the observed network state. This representation learning stage is coupled with a reduced, fixed-size, semantically meaningful and interpretable action space. We apply TERLA to a standard deep reinforcement learning Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) agent model, and to reduce the sim-to-real gap, conduct our research using Cyber Autonomy Gym for Experimentation (CAGE) Challenge 4. This Cyber Operations Research Gym environment has many of the features of a real-world network, such as realistic Intrusion Detection System (IDS) events and multiple agents defending network segments of differing topology and size. TERLA agents retain the defensive performance of vanilla PPO agents whilst showing improved action efficiency. Generalisability has been demonstrated by showing that all TERLA agents have the same network-agnostic neural network architecture, and by deploying a single TERLA agent multiple times to defend network segments with differing topology and size, showing improved defensive performance and efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c

We consider the setup in which two language model based agents perform iterative gradient updates toward their respective objectives in-context, using the output of the other agent as input. We characterize the generation dynamics associated with the interaction when the agents have misaligned objectives, and show that this results in a biased equilibrium where neither agent reaches its target - with the residual errors predictable from the objective gap and the geometry induced by the prompt of each agent.

Although humans effortlessly solve ARC-AGI, it remains extremely difficult for even the most advanced artificial intelligence systems. Inspired by methods for modelling human intelligence spanning neuroscience to psychology, we propose a cognitively plausible ARC-AGI solver. Our solver integrates System 1 intuitions with System 2 reasoning in an efficient and interpretable process using neurosymbolic methods based on Vector Symbolic Algebras (VSAs). Our solver works by object-centric program synthesis, leveraging VSAs to represent abstract objects, guide solution search, and enable sample-efficient neural learning. Preliminary results indicate success, with our solver scoring 10.8% on ARC-AGI-1-Train and 3.0% on ARC-AGI-1-Eval. Additionally, our solver performs well on simpler benchmarks, scoring 94.5% on Sort-of-ARC and 83.1% on 1D-ARC -- the latter outperforming GPT-4 at a tiny fraction of the computational cost. Importantly, our approach is unique; we believe we are the first to apply VSAs to ARC-AGI and have developed the most cognitively plausible ARC-AGI solver yet.

On LLM Agent Behavior in Dictator Games", "comment": "7 pages, 2 figures, v1 init", "summary": "In behavioral sciences, experiments such as the ultimatum game are conducted to assess preferences for fairness or self-interest of study participants. In the dictator game, a simplified version of the ultimatum game where only one of two players makes a single decision, the dictator unilaterally decides how to split a fixed sum of money between themselves and the other player. Although recent studies have explored behavioral patterns of AI agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) instructed to adopt different personas, we question the robustness of these results. In particular, many of these studies overlook the role of the system prompt - the underlying instructions that shape the model's behavior - and do not account for how sensitive results can be to slight changes in prompts. However, a robust baseline is essential when studying highly complex behavioral aspects of LLMs. To overcome previous limitations, we propose the LLM agent behavior study (LLM-ABS) framework to (i) explore how different system prompts influence model behavior, (ii) get more reliable insights into agent preferences by using neutral prompt variations, and (iii) analyze linguistic features in responses to open-ended instructions by LLM agents to better understand the reasoning behind their behavior. We found that agents often exhibit a strong preference for fairness, as well as a significant impact of the system prompt on their behavior. From a linguistic perspective, we identify that models express their responses differently. Although prompt sensitivity remains a persistent challenge, our proposed framework demonstrates a robust foundation for LLM agent behavior studies.

MAMOS offers enhanced scalability and robustness through decentralised control and more accurately reflects inherent trade-offs between conflicting objectives. In MAMOS, each agent uses utility functions that map return vectors to scalar values. Existing MAMOS optimisation methods face challenges in handling heterogeneous objective and utility function settings, where training non-stationarity is intensified due to private utility functions and the associated policies. In this paper, we first theoretically prove that direct access to, or structured modeling of, global utility functions is necessary for the Bayesian Nash Equilibrium under decentralised execution constraints. To access the global utility functions while preserving the decentralised execution, we propose an Agent-Attention Multi-Agent Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (AA-MAMORL) framework. Our approach implicitly learns a joint belief over other agents' utility functions and their associated policies during centralised training, effectively mapping global states and utilities to each agent's policy. In execution, each agent independently selects actions based on local observations and its private utility function to approximate a BNE, without relying on inter-agent communication. We conduct comprehensive experiments in both a custom-designed MAMO Particle environment and the standard MOMALand benchmark.

We challenge this paradigm by asking: what if we explicitly architected RL systems as inference engines that can answer diverse queries about their environment? In deterministic settings, trained agents implicitly encode rich knowledge about reachability, distances, values, and dynamics - yet current architectures are not designed to expose this information efficiently. We introduce Query Conditioned Deterministic Inference Networks (QDIN), a unified architecture that treats different types of queries (policy, reachability, paths, comparisons) as first-class citizens, with specialized neural modules optimized for each inference pattern. Our key empirical finding reveals a fundamental decoupling: inference accuracy can reach near-perfect levels (99% reachability IoU) even when control performance remains suboptimal (31% return), suggesting that the representations needed for accurate world knowledge differ from those required for optimal control. Experiments demonstrate that query specialized architectures outperform both unified models and post-hoc extraction methods, while maintaining competitive control performance. This work establishes a research agenda for RL systems designed from inception as queryable knowledge bases, with implications for interpretability, verification, and human-AI collaboration.", "AI":

Macroscopic emission fundamental diagram (eMFD)captures an orderly relationship among emission and aggregated traffic variables at the network level, allowing for real-time monitoring of region-wide emissions and optimal allocation of travel demand to existing networks, reducing urban congestion and associated emissions. However, empirically derived eMFD models are sparse due to historical data limitation. Leveraging a large-scale and granular traffic and emission data derived from probe vehicles, this study is the first to apply machine learning methods to predict the network wide emission rate to traffic relationship in U.S. urban areas at a large scale. The analysis framework and insights developed in this work generate data-driven eMFDs and a deeper understanding of their location dependence on network, infrastructure, land use, and vehicle characteristics, enabling transportation authorities to measure carbon emissions from urban transport of given travel demand and optimize location specific traffic management and planning decisions to mitigate network-wide emissions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubbf8\uad6d \ub3c4\uc2dc \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc758 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uc804\uccb4 \ubc30\ucd9c\ub960\uacfc \uad50\ud1b5 \uac04\uc758 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub3c4\uc2dc \ud63c\uc7a1\uc740 \ucc28\ub7c9\uc758 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc774\ub3d9\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud558\uace0 \uc628\uc2e4\uac00\uc2a4 \ubc30\ucd9c \ubc0f \ub3c4\uc2dc \ub300\uae30 \uc624\uc5fc\uc744 \uc545\ud654\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud504\ub85c\ube0c \ucc28\ub7c9\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\ub798\ud55c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ubc0f \uc138\ubd84\ud654\ub41c \uad50\ud1b5 \ubc0f \ubc30\ucd9c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uc804\uccb4 \ubc30\ucd9c\ub960\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18 eMFD\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c, \uc778\ud504\ub77c, \ud1a0\uc9c0 \uc0ac\uc6a9 \ubc0f \ucc28\ub7c9 \ud2b9\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc704\uce58 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \uae4a\uc774 \uc774\ud574\ud558\ub294 \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub3c4\uc2dc \uad50\ud1b5\uc758 \ud0c4\uc18c \ubc30\ucd9c\uc744 \uce21\uc815\ud558\uace0 \uc704\uce58\ubcc4 \uad50\ud1b5 \uad00\ub9ac \ubc0f \uacc4\ud68d \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uc804\uccb4 \ubc30\ucd9c\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uae30\uc5ec\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub3c4\uc2dc \ud63c\uc7a1\uc740 \ucc28\ub7c9\uc758 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc774\ub3d9\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud558\uace0 \uc628\uc2e4\uac00\uc2a4 \ubc30\ucd9c \ubc0f \ub3c4\uc2dc \ub300\uae30 \uc624\uc5fc\uc744 \uc545\ud654\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9e4\ud06c\ub85c \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ubc30\ucd9c \uae30\ubcf8 \ub2e4\uc774\uc5b4\uadf8\ub7a8(eMFD)\uc740 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uc218\uc900\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc30\ucd9c\ub7c9\uacfc \uc9d1\uacc4\ub41c \uad50\ud1b5 \ubcc0\uc218 \uac04\uc758 \uc9c8\uc11c \uc788\ub294 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uc5ec \uc9c0\uc5ed \uc804\uccb4 \ubc30\ucd9c\ub7c9\uc758 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\uacfc \uae30\uc874 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5ec\ud589 \uc218\uc694\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801 \ud560\ub2f9\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \ub3c4\uc2dc \ud63c\uc7a1\uacfc \uad00\ub828 \ubc30\ucd9c\uc744 \uc904\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\ub3c4\ub41c eMFD \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc81c\ud55c\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ubd80\uc871\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud504\ub85c\ube0c \ucc28\ub7c9\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\ub798\ud55c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ubc0f \uc138\ubd84\ud654\ub41c \uad50\ud1b5 \ubc0f \ubc30\ucd9c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubbf8\uad6d \ub3c4\uc2dc \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc758 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uc804\uccb4 \ubc30\ucd9c\ub960\uacfc \uad50\ud1b5 \uac04\uc758 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uc608\uce21\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ucc98\uc74c\uc73c\ub85c \uc801\uc6a9\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uac1c\ubc1c\ub41c \ubd84\uc11d \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc640 \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18 eMFD\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c, \uc778\ud504\ub77c, \ud1a0\uc9c0 \uc0ac\uc6a9 \ubc0f \ucc28\ub7c9 \ud2b9\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc704\uce58 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uae4a\uc740 \uc774\ud574\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uad50\ud1b5 \ub2f9\uad6d\uc774 \uc8fc\uc5b4\uc9c4 \uc5ec\ud589 \uc218\uc694\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ub3c4\uc2dc \uad50\ud1b5\uc758 \ud0c4\uc18c \ubc30\ucd9c\uc744 \uce21\uc815\ud558\uace0 \uc704\uce58\ubcc4 \ud2b9\uc815 \uad50\ud1b5 \uad00\ub9ac \ubc0f \uacc4\ud68d \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uc804\uccb4 \ubc30\ucd9c\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

In Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), communication enables coordination but can lead to inefficient information exchange, since agents may generate redundant or non-essential messages. While prior work has focused on boosting task performance with information exchange, the existing research lacks a thorough investigation of both the appropriate definition and the optimization of communication protocols (communication topology and message). To fill this gap, we introduce a generalized framework for learning multi-round communication protocols that are both effective and efficient. Within this framework, we propose three novel Communication Efficiency Metrics (CEMs) to guide and evaluate the learning process: the Information Entropy Efficiency Index (IEI) and Specialization Efficiency Index (SEI) for efficiency-augmented optimization, and the Topology Efficiency Index (TEI) for explicit evaluation. We integrate IEI and SEI as the adjusted loss functions to promote informative messaging and role specialization, while using TEI to quantify the trade-off between communication volume and task performance. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our learned communication protocol can significantly enhance communication efficiency and achieves better cooperation performance with improved success rates.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778

Recent reinforcement learning approaches address this limitation but face two critical challenges. First, they evaluate teaching effectiveness solely based on whether students produce correct outputs, unable to distinguish whether students genuinely understand or echo teacher-provided answers during interaction. Second, they cannot perceive students' evolving cognitive states in real time through interactive dialogue, thus failing to adapt teaching strategies to match students' cognitive levels dynamically. We propose the Unidirectional Cognitive Optimization (UCO) method to address these challenges. UCO uses a multi-turn interactive reinforcement learning paradigm where the innovation lies in two synergistic reward functions: the Progress Reward captures students' cognitive advancement, evaluating whether students truly transition from confusion to comprehension, while the Scaffold Reward dynamically identifies each student's Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), encouraging teachers to maintain productive teaching within this zone. We evaluate UCO by comparing it against 11 baseline models on BigMath and MathTutorBench benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our UCO model outperforms all models of equivalent scale and achieves performance comparable to advanced closed-source models.

Its primary advantage lies in its exceptional speed, enabling action selection for thousands of agents within milliseconds by considering only the immediate next timestep. However, this short-horizon design leads to poor performance in scenarios where agents have orientation and must perform time-consuming rotation actions. In this work, we present an enhanced version of PIBT that addresses this limitation by incorporating multi-action operations. We detail the modifications introduced to improve PIBT's performance while preserving its hallmark efficiency.

Lumine adopts a human-like interaction paradigm that unifies perception, reasoning, and action in an end-to-end manner, powered by a vision-language model. It processes raw pixels at 5 Hz to produce precise 30 Hz keyboard-mouse actions and adaptively invokes reasoning only when necessary. Trained in Genshin Impact, Lumine successfully completes the entire five-hour Mondstadt main storyline on par with human-level efficiency and follows natural language instructions to perform a broad spectrum of tasks in both 3D open-world exploration and 2D GUI manipulation across collection, combat, puzzle-solving, and NPC interaction. In addition to its in-domain performance, Lumine demonstrates strong zero-shot cross-game generalization. Without any fine-tuning, it accomplishes 100-minute missions in Wuthering Waves and the full five-hour first chapter of Honkai: Star Rail. These promising results highlight Lumine's effectiveness across distinct worlds and interaction dynamics, marking a concrete step toward generalist agents in open-ended environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "Lumine\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ubbf8\uc158\uc744 3D \uc624\ud508 \uc6d4\ub4dc \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\uc81c \uc2dc\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\ud615 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uccab \uacf5\uac1c \ub808\uc2dc\ud53c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc77c\ubc18\ud615 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud568.", "method": "Lumine\uc740 \ube44\uc804-\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc778\uc9c0, \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uc778\uac04\uacfc \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \ucc44\ud0dd\ud558\uba70, 5Hz\uc758 \uc6d0\uc2dc \ud53d\uc140 \ucc98\ub9ac\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 30Hz\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ud0a4\ubcf4\ub4dc-\ub9c8\uc6b0\uc2a4 \uc561\uc158\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "Lumine\uc740 Genshin Impact\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6c8\ub828\ub418\uc5b4, \uc0ac\ub78c \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc73c\ub85c Mondstadt \uba54\uc778 \uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9ac\ub97c \uc644\uc218\ud558\uace0 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uc9c0\uc2dc\ub97c \ub530\ub974\uba70 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc784\ubb34\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Lumine\uc740 \ud2b9\ud788 \ub2e4\ub978 \uac8c\uc784\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uc624\ud508\ub41c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\ud615 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud5a5\ud55c \ud655\uc2e4\ud55c \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc778 3D \uc624\ud508 \uc6d4\ub4dc \ud658\uacbd \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc218 \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \uac78\uce5c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc784\ubb34\ub97c \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \uc644\ub8cc\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\ud615 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \uacf5\uac1c \ub808\uc2dc\ud53c\uc778 Lumine\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

We explicitly model how inter-agent coordination structures evolve over time. While most MARL approaches rely on static or per-step relational graphs, they overlook the temporal evolution of interactions that naturally arise as agents adapt, move, or reorganize cooperation strategies. Capturing such evolving dependencies is key to achieving robust and adaptive coordination. To this end, TIGER constructs dynamic temporal graphs of MARL agents, connecting their current and historical interactions. It then employs a temporal attention-based encoder to aggregate information across these structural and temporal neighborhoods, yielding time-aware agent embeddings that guide cooperative policy learning. Through extensive experiments on two coordination-intensive benchmarks, we show that TIGER consistently outperforms diverse value-decomposition and graph-based MARL baselines in task performance and sample efficiency. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies to isolate the impact of key design parameters in TIGER, revealing how structural and temporal factors can jointly shape effective policy learning in MARL.

However, these approaches overlook a fundamental question: what happens when one form of recursive cognition--AI systems with their attention mechanisms, iterative processing, and feedback loops--encounters the recursive communicative processes of other species? Drawing on philosopher Yuk Hui's work on recursivity and contingency, I argue that AI systems are not neutral pattern detectors but recursive cognitive agents whose own information processing may systematically obscure or distort other species' communicative structures. This creates a double contingency problem: each species' communication emerges through contingent ecological and evolutionary conditions, while AI systems process these signals through their own contingent architectural and training conditions. I propose that addressing this challenge requires reconceptualizing bioacoustic AI from universal pattern recognition toward diplomatic encounter between different forms of recursive cognition, with implications for model design, evaluation frameworks, and research methodologies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uc0dd\uccb4\uc74c\ud5a5 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ub3d9\ubb3c \uc758\uc0ac\uc18c\ud1b5\uc744 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uc5ec \uc778\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \uad50\ucc28 \uc885 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \ub2e4\ub978 \uc885\uc758 \uc758\uc0ac\uc18c\ud1b5 \uacfc\uc815\uacfc \ub9c8\uc8fc\uce60 \ub54c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \uac04\uacfc\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \ub2e4\ub978 \uc885\uc758 \uc758\uc0ac\uc18c\ud1b5 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud750\ub9ac\uac8c \ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc65c\uace1\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 recursive cognitive agent\ub85c\uc11c\uc758 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc8fc\uc758 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998, \ubc18\ubcf5 \ucc98\ub9ac \ubc0f \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \ub8e8\ud504\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uc7ac\uadc0\uc801 \uc778\uc9c0 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac1c\ub150\uc801 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uacfc \ub2e4\ub978 \uc885\uc758 \uc758\uc0ac\uc18c\ud1b5 \uc0ac\uc774\uc758 \ubcf5\ud569\uc801\uc778 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b4\ub294 \uc774\uc911 \uc6b0\uc5f0\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc815\uc758\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc0dd\uccb4\uc74c\ud5a5 AI\ub97c \ubcf4\ud3b8\uc801 \ud328\ud134 \uc778\uc2dd\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud615\ud0dc\uc758 \uc7ac\uadc0\uc801 \uc778\uc9c0 \uac04\uc758 \uc678\uad50\uc801 \ub9cc\ub0a8\uc73c\ub85c \uac1c\ub150\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uc0dd\uccb4\uc74c\ud5a5 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ub3d9\ubb3c \uc758\uc0ac\uc18c\ud1b5\uc744 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98, \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784 \ubc0f \uae30\ud0c0 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc778\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \uad50\ucc28 \uc885 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ud55c \uac00\uc9c0 \uc7ac\uadc0\uc801 \uc778\uc9c0 \ud615\ud0dc\uc778 \uc8fc\uc758 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998, \ubc18\ubcf5 \ucc98\ub9ac \ubc0f \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \ub8e8\ud504\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \ub2e4\ub978 \uc885\uc758 \uc7ac\uadc0\uc801 \uc758\uc0ac\uc18c\ud1b5 \uacfc\uc815\uacfc \ub9c8\uc8fc\ucce4\uc744 \ub54c \ubb34\uc5c7\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uac04\uacfc\ud55c\ub2e4. \ucca0\ud559\uc790 \uc720\ud06c \ud6c4\uc774\uc758 \uc7ac\uadc0\uc131\uacfc \uc6b0\uc5f0\uc131\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c, \ub098\ub294 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uc911\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \ud328\ud134 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uae30\uac00 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \uc815\ubcf4 \ucc98\ub9ac\uac00 \ub2e4\ub978 \uc885\uc758 \uc758\uc0ac\uc18c\ud1b5 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud750\ub9ac\uac70\ub098 \uc65c\uace1\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc7ac\uadc0\uc801 \uc778\uc9c0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub77c\uace0 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc774\uc911 \uc6b0\uc5f0\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4: \uac01 \uc885\uc758 \uc758\uc0ac\uc18c\ud1b5\uc740 \uc6b0\uc5f0\uc801 \uc0dd\ud0dc \ubc0f \uc9c4\ud654 \uc870\uac74\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \ubc18\uba74, AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc790\uc2e0\ub9cc\uc758 \uc6b0\uc5f0\ud55c \uad6c\uc870 \ubc0f \ud6c8\ub828 \uc870\uac74\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub098\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0dd\uccb4\uc74c\ud5a5 AI\ub97c \ubcf4\ud3b8\uc801 \ud328\ud134 \uc778\uc2dd\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud615\ud0dc\uc758 \uc7ac\uadc0\uc801 \uc778\uc9c0 \uac04\uc758 \uc678\uad50\uc801 \ub9cc\ub0a8\uc73c\ub85c \uc7ac\uac1c\ub150\ud654\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc124\uacc4, \ud3c9\uac00 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c \ubc0f \uc5f0\uad6c \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud568\uc758\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4\ub2e4."}}

While recent deep learning models have advanced automated staging, most rely solely on raw PSG signals and neglect contextual cues used by human experts. We propose a two-stage architecture that combines a Transformer-based per-epoch encoder with a 1D CNN aggregator, and systematically investigates the effect of incorporating explicit context: subject-level clinical metadata (age, sex, BMI) and per-epoch expert event annotations (apneas, desaturations, arousals, periodic breathing). Using the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS) cohort (n=8,357), we demonstrate that contextual fusion substantially improves staging accuracy. Compared to a PSG-only baseline (macro-F1 0.7745, micro-F1 0.8774), our final model achieves macro-F1 0.8031 and micro-F1 0.9051, with event annotations contributing the largest gains. Notably, feature fusion outperforms multi-task alternatives that predict the same auxiliary labels. These results highlight that augmenting learned representations with clinically meaningful features enhances both performance and interpretability, without modifying the PSG montage or requiring additional sensors.

Code and data available at https://github.com/alvco/Founding_Fathers_AI", "summary": "Although Large Language Models (LLMs) show exceptional fluency, efforts persist to extract stronger reasoning capabilities from them. Drawing on search-based interpretations of LLM computation, this paper advances a systematic framework for understanding LLM reasoning and optimization. Namely, that enhancing reasoning is best achieved by structuring a multi-agent pipeline to ensure a traversal of the search space in a gradual, incremental, and sequential (GIS) manner. Stated succinctly, high-quality reasoning is a controlled, incremental search. To test this framework, we investigate the efficacy of recursive refinement (RR)--an iterative process of self-criticism, adversarial stress-testing, and integrating critical feedback--as a practical method for implementing GIS search. We designed an experiment comparing a simple, linear pipeline against a complex, explicitly structured pipeline leveraging a recursive refinement layer. The multi-agent models were constructed to reflect the historical personas of three US Founding Fathers (Hamilton, Jefferson, and Madison) using RAG-powered corpora and were prompted to generate responses to three contemporary political issues. Model performance was evaluated using a two-tiered approach: a quantitative score from an LLM arbiter agent and qualitative human judgment. Our results revealed that the complex model consistently outperformed the simple model across all nine test cases with an average arbiter-outputted score of 88.3 versus 71.7. The complex model's arguments were superior in analytical depth, structural nuance, and strategic framing. We conclude that recursive refinement is a robust architectural feature for enhancing LLM reasoning via GIS search.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4

Now they are superseded by diffusion based models. Efforts to improve traditional models have stagnated as a result. In old-school fashion, we explore image generation with conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAE) to incorporate desired attributes within the images. VAEs are known to produce blurry images with less diversity, we refer a method that solve this issue by leveraging the variance of the gaussian decoder as a learnable parameter during training. Previous works on CVAEs assumed that the conditional distribution of the latent space given the labels is equal to the prior distribution, which is not the case in reality. We show that estimating it using normalizing flows results in better image generation than existing methods by reducing the FID by 5% and increasing log likelihood by 7.7% than the previous case.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 generative \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc815\uccb4\ub41c \uc0ac\uc774, \uc800\uc790\ub4e4\uc740 CVAE\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uc18d\uc131 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 generative \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 stagnation\uc5d0 \ube60\uc9c4 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud6c8\ub828 \uc911 \uac00\uc6b0\uc2dc\uc548 \ub514\ucf54\ub354\uc758 \ubd84\uc0b0\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec CVAE\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 FID\ub97c 5% \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \ub85c\uadf8 \uc6b0\ub3c4\ub294 7.7% \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc5bb\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc815\uc0c1\ud654 \ud750\ub984\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \ub77c\ubca8\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \uc7a0\uc7ac \uacf5\uac04\uc758 \uc870\uac74\ubd80 \ubd84\ud3ec \ucd94\uc815\uc774 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub192\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubcc0\ub7c9 \uc624\ud1a0\uc778\ucf54\ub354(Variational Autoencoders, VAE)\uc640 \uc0dd\uc131\uc801 \uc801\ub300 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(Generative Adversarial Networks, GAN)\uc740 2022\ub144\uae4c\uc9c0 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c \uc790\ub9ac \uc7a1\uace0 \uc788\uc5c8\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc774\uc81c\ub294 \ud655\uc0b0 \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ub300\uccb4\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub824\ub294 \ub178\ub825\ub3c4 \uc815\uccb4\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc870\uac74\ubd80 \ubcc0\ub7c9 \uc624\ud1a0\uc778\ucf54\ub354(Conditional Variational Autoencoders, CVAE)\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ub0b4 \uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4.

The models have a persistent error rate that prevents scale-up: for instance, recent experiments in the Towers of Hanoi benchmark domain showed that the process inevitably becomes derailed after at most a few hundred steps. Thus, although LLM research is often still benchmarked on tasks with relatively few dependent logical steps, there is increasing attention on the ability (or inability) of LLMs to perform long range tasks. This paper describes MAKER, the first system that successfully solves a task with over one million LLM steps with zero errors, and, in principle, scales far beyond this level. The approach relies on an extreme decomposition of a task into subtasks, each of which can be tackled by focused microagents. The high level of modularity resulting from the decomposition allows error correction to be applied at each step through an efficient multi-agent voting scheme. This combination of extreme decomposition and error correction makes scaling possible. Thus, the results suggest that instead of relying on continual improvement of current LLMs, massively decomposed agentic processes (MDAPs) may provide a way to efficiently solve problems at the level of organizations and societies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 LLM\uc774 \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubc31\ub9cc \ub2e8\uacc4 \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud560

Our method applies a structured Laplace approximation to the second linear layer of each expert, enabling calibrated uncertainty estimation without modifying the original training procedure or introducing new parameters. Unlike prior approaches, which apply Bayesian inference to added adapter modules, Bayesian-MoE directly targets the expert pathways already present in MoE models, leveraging their modular design for tractable block-wise posterior estimation. We use Kronecker-factored low-rank approximations to model curvature and derive scalable estimates of predictive uncertainty and marginal likelihood. Experiments on common-sense reasoning benchmarks with Qwen1.5-MoE and DeepSeek-MoE demonstrate that Bayesian-MoE improves both expected calibration error (ECE) and negative log-likelihood (NLL) over baselines, confirming its effectiveness for reliable downstream decision-making.", "AI": {"tldr": "Bayesian-MoE\ub294 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ub41c \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0ac\ud6c4 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ucd94\uc815 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uac1c\ubc1c\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc758 \ub450 \ubc88\uc9f8 \uc120\ud615 \uacc4\uce35\uc5d0 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ub77c\ud50c\ub77c\uc2a4 \uadfc\uc0ac\ub97c \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ucd94\uc815\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "Bayesian-MoE\ub294 \uae30\ub300 \ubcf4\uc815 \uc624\ub958\uc640 \uc74c\uc758 \ub85c\uadf8 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uba70, \uae30\uc874 \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Bayesian-MoE\ub294 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ucd94\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc784\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Mixture-of-Experts \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uc815\ubc00 \uc870\uc815\ub41c \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0ac\ud6c4 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ucd94\uc815 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Bayesian Mixture of Experts(Bayesian-MoE)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uac01 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc758 \ub450 \ubc88\uc9f8 \uc120\ud615 \uacc4\uce35\uc5d0 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ub77c\ud50c\ub77c\uc2a4 \uadfc\uc0ac\ub97c \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc6d0\ub798 \uad50\uc721 \uc808\ucc28\ub97c \uc218\uc815\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0\ub3c4 \ubcf4\uc815\ub41c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ucd94\uc815\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc5b4\ub311\ud130 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc5d0 \ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uacfc \ub2ec\ub9ac, Bayesian-MoE\ub294 \uc774\ubbf8 MoE \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\ub294 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc9c1\uc811 \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub4c8\ud615 \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ube14\ub85d \ub2e8\uc704\uc758 \ud6c4\ubc29 \ucd94\uc815\uc744 \uc6a9\uc774\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud06c\ub85c\ub124\ucee4 \uc778\uc218 \ubd84\ud574\ub41c \uc800\uacc4\uc218 \uadfc\uc0ac\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uace1\ub960\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uace0 \uc608\uce21 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uacfc \uc8fc\ubcc0 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc758 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ucd94\uc815\uce58\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

The process of downsampling rich, internal latent states into discrete tokens inherently limits the depth and nuance of information that can be transmitted, thereby hindering collaborative problem-solving. Inspired by human mind-reading, we propose Interlat (Inter-agent Latent Space Communication), a paradigm that leverages the last hidden states of an LLM as a representation of its mind for direct transmission (termed latent communication). An additional compression process further compresses latent communication via entirely latent space reasoning. Experiments demonstrate that Interlat outperforms both fine-tuned chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting and single-agent baselines, promoting more exploratory behavior and enabling genuine utilization of latent information. Further compression not only substantially accelerates inference but also maintains competitive performance through an efficient information-preserving mechanism.

Equipping GUI agents with reliable episodic reasoning capabilities is essential for bridging the gap between users' concise task descriptions and the complexities of real-world execution. Current methods integrate Reinforcement Learning (RL) with System-2 Chain-of-Thought, yielding notable gains in reasoning enhancement. For long-horizon GUI tasks, historical interactions connect each screen to the goal-oriented episode chain, and effectively leveraging these clues is crucial for the current decision. However, existing native GUI agents exhibit weak short-term memory in their explicit reasoning, interpreting the chained interactions as discrete screen understanding, i.e., unawareness of the historical interactions within the episode. This history-agnostic reasoning challenges their performance in GUI automation. To alleviate this weakness, we propose a History-Aware Reasoning (HAR) framework, which encourages an agent to reflect on its own errors and acquire episodic reasoning knowledge from them via tailored strategies that enhance short-term memory in long-horizon interaction. The framework mainly comprises constructing a reflective learning scenario, synthesizing tailored correction guidelines, and designing a hybrid RL reward function. Using the HAR framework, we develop a native end-to-end model, HAR-GUI-3B, which alters the inherent reasoning mode from history-agnostic to history-aware, equipping the GUI agent with stable short-term memory and reliable perception of screen details. Comprehensive evaluations across a range of GUI-related benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub2e4\uc911\ubaa8\ub2ec \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \uadf8\ub798\ud53d \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4(GUI) \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub97c \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf30\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874 GUI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ub2e8\uae30 \uae30\uc5b5\uc774 \uc57d\ud574 \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc778\uc2dd\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc624\ub958 \ubc18\uc131 \ubc0f \uc5d0\ud53c\uc18c\ub4dc \ucd94\ub860 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc2b5\ub4dd\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \uc5ed\uc0ac \uc778\uc2dd \ucd94\ub860(HAR) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "GUI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc5d0\ud53c\uc18c\ub4dc \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac16\ucd94\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc758 \uac04\uacb0\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5 \uc124\uba85\uacfc \uc2e4\uc81c \uc2e4\ud589\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uc18c\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc5ed\uc0ac \uc778\uc2dd \ucd94\ub860(HAR) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \ubc18\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e8\uae30 \uae30\uc5b5\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ucee4\uc2a4\ud130\ub9c8\uc774\uc988\ub41c \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\ud53c\uc18c\ub4dc \ucd94\ub860 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud68d\ub4dd\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc720\ub3c4\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "HAR \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc5ed\uc0ac \ube44\uc778\uc2dd \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub4dc\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5ed\uc0ac \uc778\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\ud658\ud55c HAR-GUI-3B\ub77c\ub294 \ub05d-\ub05d \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uace0 GUI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \ub2e8\uae30 \uae30\uc5b5\uacfc \ud654\uba74 \uc138\ubd80 \uc815\ubcf4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc778\uc2dd\uc744 \ubd80\uc5ec\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c GUI \uad00\ub828 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uacfc \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub2e4\uc911\ubaa8\ub2ec \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \uadf8\ub798\ud53d \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4(GUI) \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub97c \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf30\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, training LLMs for AD faces significant challenges including high computation transmission costs, and privacy concerns associated with sensitive driving data. Federated Learning (FL) is promising for enabling autonomous vehicles (AVs) to collaboratively train models without sharing raw data. We present Federated LLM-based Autonomous Driving (FLAD), an FL framework that leverages distributed multimodal sensory data across AVs in heterogeneous environment. FLAD has three key innovations: (1) a cloud-edge-vehicle collaborative architecture that reduces communication delay and preserving data privacy; (2) an intelligent parallelized collaborative training with a communication scheduling mechanism that optimizes training efficiency, leveraging end-devices otherwise having insufficient resources for model training; and (3) a knowledge distillation method that personalizes LLM according to heterogeneous edge data. In addition, we prototype FLAD in a testbed with NVIDIA Jetsons, overcoming practical implementation challenges including CPU/GPU memory sharing in resource-constrained devices, dynamic model partitions, and fault-tolerant training.Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that FLAD achieves superior end-to-end AD performance while efficiently utilizing distributed vehicular resources, opening up new possibilities for future collaborative AD model training and knowledge sharing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc790\uc728 \uc8fc\ud589\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc18 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(FLAD)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ucc28\ub7c9 \uac04\uc758 \ubd84\uc0b0\ub41c \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \uc13c\uc11c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud611\ub825\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud574\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc790\uc728 \uc8fc\ud589 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc735\ud569 \ubc0f \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub098\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud6c8\ub828 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \ub192\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc804\uc1a1 \ube44\uc6a9\uacfc \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \uc8fc\ud589 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "FLAD\ub294 \ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc-\uc5e3\uc9c0-\ucc28\ub7c9 \ud611\ub825 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98, \uc9c0\ub2a5\ud615 \ubcd1\ub82c \ud611\ub825 \ud6c8\ub828, \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\ub9c1 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc5e3\uc9c0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc99d\ub958 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "FLAD\ub294 \ubd84\uc0b0\ub41c \ucc28\ub7c9 \uc790\uc6d0\uc744 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc790\uc728 \uc8fc\ud589 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc131\uacf5\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "FLAD\ub294 \ubbf8\ub798\uc758 \ud611\ub825\uc801 \uc790\uc728 \uc8fc\ud589 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubc0f \uc9c0\uc2dd \uacf5\uc720\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc5f4\uc5b4\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \uc790\uc728 \uc8fc\ud589(AD)\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc778\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc735\ud569 \ubc0f \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 AD\ub97c \uc704\ud55c LLM \ud6c8\ub828\uc740 \ub192\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc804\uc1a1 \ube44\uc6a9\uacfc \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \uc8fc\ud589 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \uad00\ub828\ub41c \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc \ubb38\uc81c\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5(FL)\uc740 \uc790\uc728 \ucc28\ub7c9(AV)\uc774 \uc6d0\uc2dc \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uacf5\uc720\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \ud611\ub825\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud574\uc8fc\ub294 \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c AV \uac04\uc5d0 \ubd84\uc0b0\ub41c \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \uc13c\uc11c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 FL \uae30\ubc18 \uc790\uc728 \uc8fc\ud589 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(FLAD)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Contemporary benchmarks aim to evaluate the comprehensive capabilities of GUI agents in GUI operation tasks, generally determining task completion solely by inspecting the final screen state. However, GUI operation tasks consist of multiple chained steps while not all critical information is presented in the final few pages. Although a few research has begun to incorporate intermediate steps into evaluation, accurately and automatically capturing this process information still remains an open challenge. To address this weakness, we introduce ProBench, a comprehensive mobile benchmark with over 200 challenging GUI tasks covering widely-used scenarios. Remaining the traditional State-related Task evaluation, we extend our dataset to include Process-related Task and design a specialized evaluation method. A newly introduced Process Provider automatically supplies accurate process information, enabling presice assessment of agent's performance. Our evaluation of advanced GUI agents reveals significant limitations for real-world GUI scenarios. These shortcomings are prevalent across diverse models, including both large-scale generalist models and smaller, GUI-specific models. A detailed error analysis further exposes several universal problems, outlining concrete directions for future improvements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 GUI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8

To address this, we propose FairM2S, a fairness-aware meta-learning framework for stress detection leveraging audio-visual data. FairM2S integrates Equalized Odds constraints during both meta-training and adaptation phases, employing adversarial gradient masking and fairness-constrained meta-updates to effectively mitigate bias. Evaluated against five state-of-the-art baselines, FairM2S achieves 78.1% accuracy while reducing the Equal Opportunity to 0.06, demonstrating substantial fairness gains. We also release SAVSD, a smartphone-captured dataset with gender annotations, designed to support fairness research in low-resource, real-world contexts. Together, these contributions position FairM2S as a state-of-the-art approach for equitable and scalable few-shot stress detection in mental health AI.

These systems work autonomously towards a defined goal with reduced external control. Despite their potential, one of their flaws is the insufficient reliability which makes them especially unsuitable for high-risk domains such as healthcare or process industry. Unreliable systems pose a risk in terms of unexpected behavior during operation and mitigation techniques are needed. In this work, we derive the main reliability challenges of agentic AI systems during operation based on their characteristics. We draw the connection to traditional AI systems and formulate a fundamental reliability challenge during operation which is inherent to traditional and agentic AI systems. As our main contribution, we propose a two-layered reliability monitoring framework for agentic AI systems which consists of a out-of-distribution detection layer for novel inputs and AI transparency layer to reveal internal operations. This two-layered monitoring approach gives a human operator the decision support which is needed to decide whether an output is potential unreliable or not and intervene. This framework provides a foundation for developing mitigation techniques to reduce risk stemming from uncertain reliability during operation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uce35\uc758 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc751\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c \ub354 \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uc791\ub3d9\ud560 \ub54c\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc774\ub4e4\uc758 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uace0, \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uacfc\uc758 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ub04c\uc5b4\ub0b4\uc5b4 \ub450 \uce35\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc785\ub825\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubd84\ud3ec \uc678 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\uc640 \ub0b4\ubd80 \uc791\ub3d9\uc744 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b4\ub294 AI \ud22c\uba85\uc131 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc6b4\uc601 \uc911 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud55c \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc644\ud654 \uae30\uc220 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc758 \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uad6c\ud604\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0\uc11c \ub354 \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud560 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc815\uc758\ub41c \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ud5a5\ud574 \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\uba70 \uc678\ubd80 \ud1b5\uc81c\ub97c \uc904\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \uc774 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uacb0\ud568 \uc911 \ud558\ub098\ub294 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc774 \ubd88\ucda9\ubd84\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc73c\ub85c, \uc774\ub294 \uc758\ub8cc\ub098 \uacf5\uc815 \uc0b0\uc5c5\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uace0\uc704\ud5d8 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0 \ud2b9\ud788 \ubd80\uc801\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc6b4\uc601 \uc911 \uc608\uc0c1\uce58 \ubabb\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9\uc758 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud558\uba70 \uc644\ud654 \uae30\uc220\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud2b9\uc131\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uc5ec \uc6b4\uc601 \uc911 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uacfc\uc758 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ub04c\uc5b4\ub0b4\uace0 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uacfc \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \uace0\uc720\ud55c \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uc6b4\uc601 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \uae30\uc5ec\ub85c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc785\ub825\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubd84\ud3ec \uc678 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\uc640 \ub0b4\ubd80 \uc791\ub3d9\uc744 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b4\ub294 AI \ud22c\uba85\uc131 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub450 \uce35\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub450 \uce35 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uc778\uac04 \uc6b4\uc601\uc790\uc5d0\uac8c \ucd9c\ub825\uc774 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294\uc9c0 \uc5ec\ubd80\ub97c \ud310\ub2e8\ud558\uace0 \uac1c\uc785\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \uc9c0\uc6d0\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc6b4\uc601 \uc911 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud55c \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc644\ud654 \uae30\uc220 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc758 \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Accepted for publication in the Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-26)", "summary": "We propose Federated Preconditioned Mixing (FedPM), a novel Federated Learning (FL) method that leverages second-order optimization. Prior methods--such as LocalNewton, LTDA, and FedSophia--have incorporated second-order optimization in FL by performing iterative local updates on clients and applying simple mixing of local parameters on the server. However, these methods often suffer from drift in local preconditioners, which significantly disrupts the convergence of parameter training, particularly in heterogeneous data settings. To overcome this issue, we refine the update rules by decomposing the ideal second-order update--computed using globally preconditioned global gradients--into parameter mixing on the server and local parameter updates on clients.

To tackle these challenges, we propose HyperD (Hybrid Periodic Decoupling), a novel framework that decouples traffic data into periodic and residual components. The periodic component is handled by the Hybrid Periodic Representation Module, which extracts fine-grained daily and weekly patterns using learnable periodic embeddings and spatial-temporal attention. The residual component, which captures non-periodic, high-frequency fluctuations, is modeled by the Frequency-Aware Residual Representation Module, leveraging complex-valued MLP in frequency domain. To enforce semantic separation between the two components, we further introduce a Dual-View Alignment Loss, which aligns low-frequency information with the periodic branch and high-frequency information with the residual branch. Extensive experiments on four real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that HyperD achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy, while offering superior robustness under disturbances and improved

Synthesizing these certificates involves discovering mathematical functions with current methods suffering from poor scalability, dependence on carefully designed templates, and exhaustive or incremental function-space searches. They also demand substantial manual expertise--selecting templates, solvers, and hyperparameters, and designing sampling strategies--requiring both theoretical and practical knowledge traditionally shared through linguistic reasoning rather than formalized methods.\n  This motivates a key question: can such expert reasoning be captured and operationalized by language models? We address this by introducing an LLM-based agentic framework for barrier certificate synthesis. The framework uses natural language reasoning to propose, refine, and validate candidate certificates, integrating LLM-driven template discovery with SMT-based verification, and supporting barrier-controller co-synthesis to ensure consistency between safety certificates and controllers.\n  To evaluate this capability, we introduce BarrierBench, a benchmark of 100 dynamical systems spanning linear, nonlinear, discrete-time, and continuous-time settings. Our experiments assess not only the effectiveness of LLM-guided barrier synthesis but also the utility of retrieval-augmented generation and agentic coordination strategies in improving its reliability and performance. Across these tasks, the framework achieves more than 90% success in generating valid certificates. By releasing BarrierBench and the accompanying toolchain, we aim to establish a community testbed for advancing the integration of language-based reasoning with formal verification in dynamical

The aim is to create a theoretical foundation that describes the physical embodiment, sensory perception, ability to act, learning processes, and context sensitivity of intelligent systems within a coherent framework. While classical AI approaches rely on symbolic processing and data driven models, Physical AI understands intelligence as an emergent phenomenon of real interaction between body, environment, and experience. The six fundamentals presented here are embodiment, sensory perception, motor action, learning, autonomy, and context sensitivity, and form the conceptual basis for designing and evaluating physically intelligent systems. Theoretically, it is shown that these six principles do not represent loose functional modules but rather act as a closed control loop in which energy, information, control, and context are in constant interaction. This circular interaction enables a system to generate meaning not from databases, but from physical experience, a paradigm shift that understands intelligence as an physical embodied process. Physical AI understands learning not as parameter adjustment, but as a change in the structural coupling between agents and the environment. To illustrate this, the theoretical model is explained using a practical scenario: An adaptive assistant robot supports patients in a rehabilitation clinic. This example illustrates that physical intelligence does not arise from abstract calculation, but from immediate, embodied experience. It shows how the six fundamentals interact in a real system: embodiment as a prerequisite, perception as input, movement as expression, learning as adaptation, autonomy as regulation, and context as orientation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5\uc758 \uae30\ubcf8 \uc6d0\ub9ac\ub97c \uacfc\ud559\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778

A key driver influencing B&B solvers efficiency is the variable selection heuristic that guides branching decisions. Looking to move beyond static, hand-crafted heuristics, recent work has explored adapting traditional reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to the B&B setting, aiming to learn branching strategies tailored to specific MILP distributions. In parallel, RL agents have achieved remarkable success in board games, a very specific type of combinatorial problems, by leveraging environment simulators to plan via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Building on these developments, we introduce Plan-and-Branch-and-Bound (PlanB&B), a model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) agent that leverages a learned internal model of the B&B dynamics to discover improved branching strategies. Computational experiments empirically validate our approach, with our MBRL branching agent outperforming previous state-of-the-art RL methods across four standard MILP benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud63c\ud569 \uc815\uc218 \uc120\ud615 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd84\uae30 \ubc0f \uacbd\uacc4 \uc194\ubc84\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud63c\ud569 \uc815\uc218 \uc120\ud615 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d(MILP)\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc870\ud569 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec\uc774\uba70, \ubd84\uae30 \ubc0f \uacbd\uacc4(B&B) \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uacb0\ub41c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ubd84\uae30 \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc548\ub0b4\ud558\ub294 \ubcc0\uc218 \uc120\ud0dd \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1\uc740 B&B \uc194\ubc84\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc5d0 \ud070 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce5c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL) \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 B&B \uc124\uc815\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud2b9\uc815 MILP \ubd84\ud3ec\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucd98 \ubd84\uae30 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(MBRL) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc778 Plan-and-Branch-and-Bound(PlanB&B)\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uacc4\uc0b0 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 MBRL \ubd84\uae30 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud45c\uc900 MILP \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 RL \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\ub294 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \uac70\ub450\uc5c8\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "PlanB&B\ub294 \ubd84\uae30 \uc804\ub7b5 \uac1c\uc120\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uba70, B&B \ub2e4\uc774\ub098\ubbf9\uc2a4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \ub0b4\ubd80 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \uc720\ud6a8\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud63c\ud569 \uc815\uc218 \uc120\ud615 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d(MILP)\uc740 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc870\ud569 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654(CO) \ubb38\uc81c\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec\uc5d0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uae30 \ubc0f \uacbd\uacc4(B&B) \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uacb0\ub41c\ub2e4.

However, the success of adversarial optimization has been largely limited to zero-sum settings because its naive application in cooperative settings leads to a critical failure mode: agents are irrationally incentivized to self-sabotage, blocking the completion of tasks and halting further learning. To address this, we introduce Rationality-preserving Policy Optimization (RPO), a formalism for adversarial optimization that avoids self-sabotage by ensuring agents remain rational--that is, their policies are optimal with respect to some possible partner policy. To solve RPO, we develop Rational Policy Gradient (RPG), which trains agents to maximize their own reward in a modified version of the original game in which we use opponent shaping techniques to optimize the adversarial objective. RPG enables us to extend a variety of existing adversarial optimization algorithms that, no longer subject to the limitations of self-sabotage, can find adversarial examples, improve robustness and adaptability, and learn diverse policies.

Conventional solutions for this problem incorporate quantum-inspired neural networks with Kronecker products and hybrid tensor neural networks with MPO factorization and fully-connected layers. Nonetheless, the generalization power and robustness of the fully-connected layers are not as outstanding as circuit models in quantum computing. In this paper, we propose a novel tensor circuit neural network (TCNN) that takes advantage of the characteristics of tensor neural networks and residual circuit models to achieve generalization ability and robustness with low complexity. The proposed activation operation and parallelism of the circuit in complex number field improves its non-linearity and efficiency for feature learning. Moreover, since the feature information exists in the parameters in both the real and imaginary parts in TCNN, an information fusion layer is proposed for merging features stored in those parameters to enhance the generalization capability. Experimental results confirm that TCNN showcases more outstanding generalization and robustness with its average accuracies on various datasets 2\\%-3\\% higher than those of the state-of-the-art compared models. More significantly, while other models fail to learn features under noise parameter attacking, TCNN still showcases prominent learning capability owing to its ability to prevent gradient explosion. Furthermore, it is comparable to the compared models on the number of trainable parameters and the CPU running time. An ablation study also indicates the advantage of the activation operation, the parallelism architecture and the information fusion layer.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294

Instead of constraining the hardware to form complete cylinders, we propose treating the missing lines-of-responses as a learnable prior. Data-driven approaches, particularly generative models, offer a promising pathway to recover this missing information.

An Extensive Approach Considering Statistical, Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models", "comment": "6,227 words text + 2*250 (2 tables) = 6,727 words", "summary": "With rapid urbanization in recent decades, traffic congestion has intensified due to increased movement of people and goods. As planning shifts from demand-based to supply-oriented strategies, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have become essential for managing traffic within existing infrastructure. A core ITS function is traffic forecasting, enabling proactive measures like ramp metering, signal control, and dynamic routing through platforms such as Google Maps. This study assesses the performance of statistical, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) models in forecasting traffic speed and flow using real-world data from California's Harbor Freeway, sourced from the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS). Each model was evaluated over 20 forecasting windows (up to 1 hour 40 minutes) using RMSE, MAE, and R-Square metrics. Results show ANFIS-GP performs best at early windows with RMSE of 0.038, MAE of 0.0276, and R-Square of 0.9983, while Bi-LSTM is more robust for medium-term prediction due to its capacity to model long-range temporal dependencies, achieving RMSE of 0.1863, MAE of 0.0833, and R-Square of 0.987 at a forecasting of 20. The degradation in model performance was quantified using logarithmic transformation, with slope values used to measure robustness. Among DL models, Bi-LSTM had the flattest slope (0.0454 RMSE, 0.0545 MAE for flow), whereas ANFIS-GP had 0.1058 for RMSE and 0.1037 for flow MAE. The study concludes by identifying hybrid models as a promising future direction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uce98\ub9ac\ud3ec\ub2c8\uc544 \ud558\ubc84 \uace0\uc18d\ub3c4\ub85c\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801, \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc0f \uc2ec\uce35 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uad50\ud1b5 \uc18d\ub3c4 \ubc0f \ud750\ub984 \uc608\uce21 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ucd5c\uadfc \uba87 \ub144 \uac04\uc758 \uae09\uaca9\ud55c \ub3c4\uc2dc\ud654\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uad50\ud1b5 \ud63c\uc7a1\uc774 \uc2ec\ud654\ub418\uc5c8\uace0, \uc774\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uacf5\uae09 \uc9c0\ud5a5 \uc804\ub7b5\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \uacc4\ud68d \uc804\ud658\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud574\uc84c\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c 20\uac1c\uc758 \uc608\uce21 \ucc3d(over 20 forecasting windows)\uc5d0\uc11c RMSE, MAE, R-Square \uc9c0\ud45c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uac01 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "ANFIS-GP\uac00 \ucd08\uae30 \uc608\uce21 \ucc3d\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uace0\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc73c\uba70, Bi-LSTM\uc740 \uc911\uae30 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0\uc11c \ub354 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ubbf8\ub798\uc758 \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \ubc29\ud5a5\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc \uba87 \ub144 \uac04\uc758 \uae09\uaca9\ud55c \ub3c4\uc2dc\ud654\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc0ac\ub78c\uacfc \ubb3c\uc790\uc758 \uc774\ub3d9\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uad50\ud1b5 \ud63c\uc7a1\uc774 \uc2ec\ud654\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc218\uc694 \uae30\ubc18\uc5d0\uc11c \uacf5\uae09 \uc9c0\ud5a5 \uc804\ub7b5\uc73c\ub85c \uacc4\ud68d\uc774 \uc804\ud658\ub428\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \uc9c0\ub2a5\ud615 \uad50\ud1b5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(ITS)\uc774 \uae30\uc874 \uc778\ud504\ub77c \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uad50\ud1b5\uc744 \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774 \ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.
