Given a set of options (temporally abstract actions) available to each\nagent, we convert the task specification into the corresponding Buchi Automaton\nand proceed with a model-free approach which collects transition samples and\nconstructs a product Semi Markov Decision Process (SMDP) on-the-fly.\nValue-based Reinforcement Learning algorithms can then be used to synthesize a\ncorrect-by-design controller without learning the underlying transition model\nof the multi-agent system. The exponential sample complexity due to multiple\nagents is dealt with using a novel reward shaping approach. We test the\nproposed algorithm in a deterministic gridworld simulation for different tasks\nand find that the reward shaping results in significant reduction in\nconvergence times. We also infer that using options becomes increasing more\nrelevant as the state and action space increases in multi-agent systems."}

However, their application in\ndynamic, real-time evacuation support remains limited. Existing models often\noverlook the psychological and emotional complexity of human behavior under\nextreme stress. In real-world fire scenarios, evacuees frequently deviate from\ndesignated safe routes due to panic and uncertainty. To address these\nchallenges, this paper presents a multi-agent coordination framework in which\nautonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) assist human evacuees in real-time\nby locating, intercepting, and guiding them to safety under uncertain\nconditions. We model the problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision\nProcess (POMDP), where two heterogeneous UAV agents, a high-level rescuer (HLR)\nand a low-level rescuer (LLR), coordinate through shared observations and\ncomplementary capabilities. Human behavior is captured using an agent-based\nmodel grounded in empirical psychology, where panic dynamically affects\ndecision-making and movement in response to environmental stimuli. The\nenvironment features stochastic fire spread, unknown evacuee locations, and\nlimited visibility, requiring UAVs to plan over long horizons to search for\nhumans and adapt in real-time. Our framework employs the Proximal Policy\nOptimization (PPO) algorithm with recurrent policies to enable robust\ndecision-making in partially observable settings.

Causal discovery in time series is\nhindered by the combinatorial complexity of identifying true causal\nrelationships, especially as the number of variables and time points grow. A\ncommon approach to simplify the task is the so-called ordering-based methods.\nTraditional ordering methods inherently limit the representational capacity of\nthe resulting model. In this work, we fix this issue by leveraging multiple\nvalid causal orderings, instead of a single one as standard practice.

It\npromises transformative opportunities for advancing and disrupting existing\npractices, including healthcare. From large language models (LLMs) for clinical\nnote synthesis and conversational assistance to multimodal systems that\nintegrate medical imaging, electronic health records, and genomic data for\ndecision support, GenAI is transforming the practice of medicine and the\ndelivery of healthcare, such as diagnosis and personalized treatments, with\ngreat potential in reducing the cognitive burden on clinicians, thereby\nimproving overall healthcare delivery. However, GenAI deployment in healthcare\nrequires an in-depth understanding of healthcare tasks and what can and cannot\nbe achieved. In this paper, we propose a data-centric paradigm in the design\nand deployment of GenAI systems for healthcare. Specifically, we reposition the\ndata life cycle by making the medical data ecosystem as the foundational\nsubstrate for generative healthcare systems. This ecosystem is designed to\nsustainably support the integration, representation, and retrieval of diverse\nmedical data and knowledge. With effective and efficient data processing\npipelines, such as semantic vector search and contextual querying, it enables\nGenAI-powered operations for upstream model components and downstream clinical\napplications. Ultimately, it not only supplies foundation models with\nhigh-quality, multimodal data for large-scale pretraining and domain-specific\nfine-tuning, but also serves as a knowledge retrieval backend to support\ntask-specific inference via the agentic layer. The ecosystem enables the\ndeployment of GenAI for high-quality and effective healthcare delivery."}

We\npropose DOTS (Diffusion Ordered Temporal Structure), using diffusion-based\ncausal discovery for temporal data. By integrating multiple orderings, DOTS\neffectively recovers the transitive closure of the underlying directed acyclic\ngraph, mitigating spurious artifacts inherent in single-ordering approaches. We\nformalise the problem under standard assumptions such as stationarity and the\nadditive noise model, and leverage score matching with diffusion processes to\nenable efficient Hessian estimation. Extensive experiments validate the\napproach. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets\ndemonstrate that DOTS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, offering a\nscalable and robust approach to temporal causal discovery. On synthetic\nbenchmarks ($d{=}\\!3-\\!6$ variables, $T{=}200\\!-\\!5{,}000$ samples), DOTS\nimproves mean window-graph $F1$ from $0.63$ (best baseline) to $0.81$. On the\nCausalTime real-world benchmark ($d{=}20\\!-\\!36$), while baselines remain the\nbest on individual datasets, DOTS attains the highest average summary-graph\n$F1$ while halving runtime relative to graph-optimisation methods. These\nresults establish DOTS as a scalable and accurate solution for temporal causal\ndiscovery."}
