We formalize Dhumbal's mechanics and implement diverse agents,\nincluding heuristic approaches (Aggressive, Conservative, Balanced,\nOpportunistic), search-based methods such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and\nInformation Set Monte Carlo Tree Search (ISMCTS), and reinforcement learning\napproaches including Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization\n(PPO), and a random baseline. Evaluation involves within-category tournaments\nfollowed by a cross-category championship. Performance is measured via win\nrate, economic outcome, Jhyap success, cards discarded per round, risk\nassessment, and decision efficiency. Statistical significance is assessed using\nWelch's t-test with Bonferroni correction, effect sizes via Cohen's d, and 95%\nconfidence intervals (CI). Across 1024 simulated rounds, the rule-based\nAggressive agent achieves the highest win rate (88.3%, 95% CI: [86.3, 90.3]),\noutperforming ISMCTS (9.0%) and PPO (1.5%) through effective exploitation of\nJhyap declarations.

But AI agent evaluations suffer from many challenges that\nundermine our understanding of how well agents really work. We introduce the\nHolistic Agent Leaderboard (HAL) to address these challenges. We make three\nmain contributions. First, we provide a standardized evaluation harness that\norchestrates parallel evaluations across hundreds of VMs, reducing evaluation\ntime from weeks to hours while eliminating common implementation bugs. Second,\nwe conduct three-dimensional analysis spanning models, scaffolds, and\nbenchmarks. We validate the harness by conducting 21,730 agent rollouts across\n9 models and 9 benchmarks in coding, web navigation, science, and customer\nservice with a total cost of about $40,000. Our analysis reveals surprising\ninsights, such as higher reasoning effort reducing accuracy in the majority of\nruns. Third, we use LLM-aided log inspection to uncover previously unreported\nbehaviors, such as searching for the benchmark on HuggingFace instead of\nsolving a task, or misusing credit cards in flight booking tasks. We share all\nagent logs, comprising 2.5B tokens of language model calls, to incentivize\nfurther research into agent behavior. By standardizing how the field evaluates\nagents and addressing common pitfalls in agent evaluation, we hope to shift the\nfocus from agents that ace benchmarks to agents that work reliably in the

CausalTrace\nperforms data-driven causal analysis enriched by industrial ontologies and\nknowledge graphs, including advanced functions such as causal discovery,\ncounterfactual reasoning, and root cause analysis (RCA). It supports real-time\noperator interaction and is designed to complement existing agents by offering\ntransparent, explainable decision support.

However, policies tuned for cooperation often fail to\nmaintain robustness and resilience under real-world uncertainties. Building\ntrustworthy MARL systems requires a deep understanding of robustness, which\nensures stability under uncertainties, and resilience, the ability to recover\nfrom disruptions--a concept extensively studied in control systems but largely\noverlooked in MARL. In this paper, we present a large-scale empirical study\ncomprising over 82,620 experiments to evaluate cooperation, robustness, and\nresilience in MARL across 4 real-world environments, 13 uncertainty types, and\n15 hyperparameters. Our key findings are: (1) Under mild uncertainty,\noptimizing cooperation improves robustness and resilience, but this link\nweakens as perturbations intensify. Robustness and resilience also varies by\nalgorithm and uncertainty type. (2) Robustness and resilience do not generalize\nacross uncertainty modalities or agent scopes: policies robust to action noise\nfor all agents may fail under observation noise on a single agent. (3)\nHyperparameter tuning is critical for trustworthy MARL: surprisingly, standard\npractices like parameter sharing, GAE, and PopArt can hurt robustness, while\nearly stopping, high critic learning rates, and Leaky ReLU consistently help.\nBy optimizing hyperparameters only, we observe substantial improvement in\ncooperation, robustness and resilience across all MARL backbones, with the\nphenomenon also generalizing to robust MARL methods across these backbones.\nCode and results available at\nhttps://github.com/BUAA-TrustworthyMARL/adv_marl_benchmark .", "AI": {"tldr":

While Large language models\n(LLMs) provide few-shot generalization, they remain text-bound and blind to\ngeography. To bridge this gap, we introduce a Geospatial Awareness Layer (GAL)\nthat grounds LLM agents in structured earth data. Starting from raw wildfire\ndetections, GAL automatically retrieves and integrates infrastructure,\ndemographic, terrain, and weather information from external geodatabases,\nassembling them into a concise, unit-annotated perception script. This enriched\ncontext enables agents to produce evidence-based resource-allocation\nrecommendations (e.g., personnel assignments, budget allocations), further\nreinforced by historical analogs and daily change signals for incremental\nupdates. We evaluate the framework in real wildfire scenarios across multiple\nLLM models, showing that geospatially grounded agents can outperform baselines.\nThe proposed framework can generalize to other hazards such as floods and\nhurricanes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc9c0\ub9ac\uc801 \uc778\uc2dd\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc9c0\uce35(GAL)\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc9c0\uad6c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc7ac\ub09c \ub300\uc751\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc7ac\ub09c \ub300\uc751\uc740 \uc0dd\uba85\uacfc \uc7ac\uc0b0\uc744 \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc801 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uace0, \uc0ac\uac74 \uac04 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\uac00 \ub5a8\uc5b4\uc9c0\uba70, \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc9c0\uad6c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\uc744 \ub450\uae30 \uc704\ud574 GAL\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Heterogeneous-agent general equilibrium (GE) models, such\nas those based on Heterogeneous Agents New Keynesian (HANK) or Krusell-Smith\n(KS) approaches, rely on GE and 'rational expectations', somewhat unrealistic\nassumptions that make the models very computationally cumbersome, which in turn\nlimits the amount of heterogeneity that can be modelled. In contrast,\nagent-based models (ABMs) can flexibly encompass a large number of arbitrarily\nheterogeneous agents, but typically require the specification of explicit\nbehavioural rules, which can lead to a lengthy trial-and-error\nmodel-development process. To address these limitations, we introduce MARL-BC,\na framework that integrates deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with\nReal Business Cycle (RBC) models. We demonstrate that MARL-BC can: (1) recover\ntextbook RBC results when using a single agent; (2) recover the results of the\nmean-field KS model using a large number of identical agents; and (3)\neffectively simulate rich heterogeneity among agents, a hard task for\ntraditional GE approaches. Our framework can be thought of as an ABM if used\nwith a variety of heterogeneous interacting agents, and can reproduce GE\nresults in limit cases.

Consequently, AI red\nteaming has become essential for organizations to proactively identify and\naddress vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by adversaries. While\nnumerous AI red teaming tools currently exist, practitioners face challenges in\nselecting the most appropriate tools from a rapidly expanding landscape, as\nwell as managing complex and frequently conflicting software dependencies\nacross isolated projects. Given these challenges and the relatively small\nnumber of organizations with dedicated AI red teams, there is a strong need to\nlower barriers to entry and establish a standardized environment that\nsimplifies the setup and execution of comprehensive AI model assessments.\n  Inspired by Kali Linux's role in traditional penetration testing, we\nintroduce BlackIce, an open-source containerized toolkit designed for red\nteaming Large Language Models (LLMs) and classical machine learning (ML)\nmodels. BlackIce provides a reproducible, version-pinned Docker image that\nbundles 14 carefully selected open-source tools for Responsible AI and Security\ntesting, all accessible via a unified command-line interface. With this setup,\ninitiating red team assessments is as straightforward as launching a container,\neither locally or using a cloud platform. Additionally, the image's modular\narchitecture facilitates community-driven extensions, allowing users to easily\nadapt or expand the toolkit as new threats emerge. In this paper, we describe\nthe architecture of the container image, the process used for selecting tools,\nand the types of evaluations they support.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uacfc \ubcf4\uc548 \uc6b0\ub824\uac00 \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c AI \ub808\ub4dc \ud300\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud574\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, BlackIce\ub77c\ub294 \uc624\ud508 \uc18c\uc2a4 \ud234\ud0b7\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 LLM \ubc0f ML \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uac04\uc18c\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AI \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud1b5\ud569\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc548\uc804\uc131\uacfc \ubcf4\uc548\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc6b0\ub824\uac00 \ucee4\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "Kali Linux\uc5d0\uc11c \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc544, Red teaming\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc624\ud508 \uc18c\uc2a4 \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108\ud654\ub41c \ud234\ud0b7\uc778 BlackIce\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "BlackIce\ub294 14\uac1c\uc758 \uc120\uc815\ub41c \uc624\ud508 \uc18c\uc2a4 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uace0, \ud1b5\ud569 \uba85\ub839\uc904 \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc811\uadfc \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc124\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub808\ub4dc \ud300 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uac04\ub2e8\ud558\uac8c \uc2dc\uc791\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uac00 \ud234\ud0b7\uc744 \uc27d\uac8c \ud655\uc7a5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc2dd \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "AI \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ud1b5\ud569\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc774\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uacfc \ubcf4\uc548\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc6b0\ub824\uac00 \ucee4\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c AI \ub808\ub4dc \ud300\uc740 \uc870\uc9c1\uc774 \uc801\uc758\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc545\uc6a9\ub418\uae30 \uc804\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \uc0ac\uc804\uc5d0 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\uac8c \ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud604\uc7ac \uc5ec\ub7ec AI \ub808\ub4dc \ud300 \ub3c4\uad6c\uac00 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc2e4\ubb34\uc790\ub294 \ube60\ub974\uac8c \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uac00\uc7a5 \uc801\uc808\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\uace0 \uace0\ub9bd\ub41c \ud504\ub85c\uc81d\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud558\uace0 \uc790\uc8fc \ucda9\ub3cc\ud558\ub294 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uc885\uc18d\uc131\uc744 \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uacfc \uc804\ub2f4 AI \ub808\ub4dc \ud300\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uc870\uc9c1\uc774 \uc0c1\ub300\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc801\uc740 \uc810\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud560 \ub54c, \uc9c4\uc785 \uc7a5\ubcbd\uc744 \ub0ae\ucd94\uace0 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 AI \ubaa8\ub378 \ud3c9\uac00\uc758 \uc124\uc815\uacfc \uc2e4\ud589\uc744 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ud45c\uc900\ud654\ub41c \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \ud07d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uce68\ud22c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 Kali Linux\uc758 \uc5ed\ud560\uc5d0 \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc544, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \ubc0f \uace0\uc804 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5(ML) \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub808\ub4dc \ud300 \ud234\ud0b7\uc778 BlackIce\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Existing EEG-based methods are limited by\nfull-band frequency analysis that hinders precise differentiation of dementia\nsubtypes and severity stages. We propose a variational mixture of graph neural\nexperts (VMoGE) that integrates frequency-specific biomarker identification\nwith structured variational inference for enhanced dementia diagnosis and\nstaging. VMoGE employs a multi-granularity transformer to extract multi-scale\ntemporal patterns across four frequency bands, followed by a variational graph\nconvolutional encoder using Gaussian Markov Random Field priors.

In\ndoing so, they perform computation, although not in the classical sense --\nthere is no program being executed. Still, if they perform computation, can AI\nagents be universal? Can chain-of-thought reasoning solve any computable task?\nHow does an AI Agent learn to reason? Is it a matter of model size? Or training\ndataset size?\n  In this work, we reinterpret the role of learning in the context of AI\nAgents, viewing them as compute-capable stochastic dynamical systems, and\nhighlight the role of time in a foundational principle for learning to reason.\nIn doing so, we propose a shift from classical inductive learning to\ntransductive learning -- where the objective is not to approximate the\ndistribution of past data, but to capture their algorithmic structure to reduce\nthe time needed to find solutions to new tasks.\n  Transductive learning suggests that, counter to Shannon's theory, a key role\nof information in learning is about reduction of time rather than\nreconstruction error. In particular, we show that the optimal speed-up that a\nuniversal solver can achieve using past data is tightly related to their\nalgorithmic information. Using this, we show a theoretical derivation for the\nobserved power-law scaling of inference time versus training time. We then show\nthat scaling model size can lead to behaviors that, while improving accuracy on\nbenchmarks, fail any reasonable test of intelligence, let alone\nsuper-intelligence: In the limit of infinite space and time, large models can\nbehave as savants, able to brute-force through any task without any insight.\nInstead, we argue that the key quantity to optimize when scaling reasoning\nmodels is time, whose critical role in learning has so far only been indirectly\nconsidered.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294\ub370 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uace0 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uac00\uc124\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud558\uba70 \uc774\ub97c \ubc18\uc601\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac16\ucd94\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \uc7ac\ud574\uc11d\ud558\uace0, \uace0\uc804\uc801\uc778 \uadc0\ub0a9\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc804\uc774 \ud559\uc2b5\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \uc804\ud658\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec \uc694\uc18c\uc778 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc815\ubcf4\uc758 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc774 \uc2dc\uac04 \ub2e8\ucd95\uc5d0 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc\uac04\uacfc \ud6c8\ub828 \uc2dc\uac04 \uac04\uc758 \ube44\ub840 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\uc2dd\uacfc \uc774\ub4e4\uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc2dc\uac04\uc758 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \uc7ac\uc870\uba85\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uacc4\uc0b0 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \ud655\ub960 \uc5ed\ud559\uc801 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\uace0, \uace0\uc804\uc801\uc778 \uadc0\ub0a9\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc804\uc774 \ud559\uc2b5\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\ud658\ud558\ub294 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud588\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc815\ubcf4\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc2dc\uac04 \ub2e8\ucd95\uc5d0 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uace0, \uacfc\uac70 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub2ec\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uc18d\ub3c4 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uacfc \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc\uac04\uacfc \ud6c8\ub828 \uc2dc\uac04 \uac04\uc758 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubaa8\ub378 \ud06c\uae30\ub97c \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \ub300\uc2e0 \uc2dc\uac04 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\ud574\uc57c \ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc774 \uc9c0\uae08\uae4c\uc9c0 \uac04\uc811\uc801\uc73c\ub85c\ub9cc \uace0\ub824\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "AI \ucd94\ub860 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc774\ubbf8 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \ubc30\ud3ec\ud558\uace0 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uac00\uc124\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud558\uba70 \uc774\ub97c \ubc18\uc601\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uace0\uc804\uc801\uc778 \uc758\ubbf8\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc774 \uc2e4\ud589\ub418\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc544\ub2c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uacc4\uc0b0\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7fc\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0, AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4\uba74 \ubcf4\ud3b8\uc801\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uac00? \uc0ac\uace0\uc758 \uc5f0\uc1c4\uac00 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uac00?

At the macro level, a\npooled $\\epsilon$-machine is reconstructed as a reference model that summarizes\nthe system-wide informational regime. At the micro level, $\\epsilon$-machines\nare reconstructed for each caregiver-elder dyad and variable, and are\ncomplemented with algorithm-agnostic Kolmogorov-style measures, including\nnormalized LZ78 complexity and bits per symbol from lossless compression.

Keywords: LLM security;\n  defense-in-depth; prompt injection; activation steering; multimodal sandbox;\n  threat modeling", "summary": "The security of Large Language Model (LLM) applications is fundamentally\nchallenged by \"form-first\" attacks like prompt injection and jailbreaking,\nwhere malicious instructions are embedded within user inputs. Conventional\ndefenses, which rely on post hoc output filtering, are often brittle and fail\nto address the root cause: the model's inability to distinguish trusted\ninstructions from untrusted data. This paper proposes Countermind, a\nmulti-layered security architecture intended to shift defenses from a reactive,\npost hoc posture to a proactive, pre-inference, and intra-inference enforcement\nmodel. The architecture proposes a fortified perimeter designed to structurally\nvalidate and transform all inputs, and an internal governance mechanism\nintended to constrain the model's semantic processing pathways before an output\nis generated. The primary contributions of this work are conceptual designs\nfor: (1) A Semantic Boundary Logic (SBL) with a mandatory, time-coupled Text\nCrypter intended to reduce the plaintext prompt injection attack surface,\nprovided all ingestion paths are enforced. (2) A Parameter-Space Restriction\n(PSR) mechanism, leveraging principles from representation engineering, to\ndynamically control the LLM's access to internal semantic clusters, with the\ngoal of mitigating semantic drift and dangerous emergent behaviors. (3) A\nSecure, Self-Regulating Core that uses an OODA loop and a learning security\nmodule to adapt its defenses based on an immutable audit log. (4) A Multimodal\nInput Sandbox and Context-Defense mechanisms to address threats from\nnon-textual data and long-term semantic poisoning. This paper outlines an\nevaluation plan designed to quantify the proposed architecture's effectiveness\nin reducing the Attack Success Rate (ASR) for form-first attacks and to measure\nits potential latency overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubc29\uc5b4 \ubc29\ubc95 \ub300\uc2e0 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub2e4\uce35 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc778 Countermind\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub294 \uc545\uc131 \uc785\ub825\uc744 \uad6c\uc870\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uace0 \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\uba70, \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc801 \ucc98\ub9ac \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc81c\uc57d\ud558\ub294 \ub0b4\ubd80 \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548\uc740 \uc545\uc131 \uc9c0\uce68\uc774 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc758 \uc785\ub825\uc5d0 \uc0bd\uc785\ub418\ub294 '\ud615\uc2dd \uc6b0\uc120' \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub3c4\uc804\ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "Countermind\ub77c\ub294 \ub2e4\uce35 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \ubc18\uc751\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\uc5b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\uc804 \ubc0f \ub0b4\uc7ac\uc801\uc778 \uac15\uc81c \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c \ubc29\uc5b4\ub97c \uc804\ud658\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad6c\uc870\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc785\ub825\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uace0 \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uac15\ud654\ub41c \uacbd\uacc4\uc640 \ucd9c\ub825\uc774 \uc0dd\uc131\ub418\uae30 \uc804 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc801 \ucc98\ub9ac \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc81c\uc57d\ud558\ub294 \ub0b4\ubd80 \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub294 \ud615\uc2dd \uc6b0\uc120 \uacf5\uaca9\uc758 \uc131\uacf5\ub960(ASR)\uc744 \ub0ae\ucd94\ub294 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801\uc778 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c \uce21\uc815\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud3c9\uac00 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Countermind\ub294 \uc545\uc131 \uc785\ub825\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130\uc758 \ubcf4\ud638\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548\uc740 \uc545\uc131 \uc9c0\uce68\uc774 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc758 \uc785\ub825\uc5d0 \ud3ec\ud568\ub418\ub294 '\ud615\uc2dd \uc6b0\uc120' \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub3c4\uc804\ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\uc5b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc0ac\ud6c4 \uacb0\uacfc \ud544\ud130\ub9c1\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uba70 \uc885\uc885 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc9c0\uce68\uacfc \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uad6c\ubcc4\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uadfc\ubcf8 \uc6d0\uc778\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubc29\uc5b4\ub97c \ubc18\uc751\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc0ac\ud6c4\uc801\uc778 \ud0dc\uc138\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\uc804 \ucd94\ub860\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ub0b4\ubd80 \ucd94\ub860 \uac15\uc81c \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c \uc804\ud658\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub2e4\uce35 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc778 Countermind\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc785\ub825\uc744 \uad6c\uc870\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uace0 \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uac15\ud654\ub41c \uacbd\uacc4\uc640 \ucd9c\ub825\uc774 \uc0dd\uc131\ub418\uae30 \uc804\uc5d0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc801 \ucc98\ub9ac \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc81c\uc57d\ud558\ub824\ub294 \ub0b4\ubd80 \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \uae30\uc5ec\ub294 (1) \ud3c9\ubb38 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc8fc\uc785 \uacf5\uaca9 \ud45c\uba74\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubaa8\ub4e0 ingestion \uacbd\ub85c\uac00 \uac15\uc81c\ub85c \uc218\ud589\ub418\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc5f0\ub3d9 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud06c\ub9bd\ud130\uac00 \ud3ec\ud568\ub41c \uc758\ubbf8 \uacbd\uacc4 \ub17c\ub9ac(SBL)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac1c\ub150\uc801 \uc124\uacc4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.

To address this issue, domain generalization\napproaches have recently been studied to ensure generalized performance on\nunseen domains during training. Among those techniques, contrastive learning\nhas proven its validity in learning domain-invariant features by aligning\nsamples of the same class across different domains. Despite its potential, many\nexisting methods are insufficient to extract adequately domain-invariant\nrepresentations, as they do not explicitly address domain characteristics\nembedded within the unshared information across samples. In this paper, we\nposit that mitigating such domain-relevant attributes-referred to as excess\ndomain-relevant information-is key to bridging the domain gap. However, the\ndirect strategy to mitigate the domain-relevant attributes often overfits\nfeatures at the high-level information, limiting their ability to leverage the\ndiverse temporal and spectral information encoded in the multiple feature\nlevels. To address these limitations, we propose a novel MEASURE (Multi-scalE\nminimAl SUfficient Representation lEarning) framework, which effectively\nreduces domain-relevant information while preserving essential temporal and\nspectral features for sleep stage classification. In our exhaustive experiments\non publicly available sleep staging benchmark datasets, SleepEDF-20 and MASS,\nour proposed method consistently outperformed state-of-the-art methods.

Existing mobility-based demographic inference studies heavily rely on\nlarge-scale trajectory data with demographic labels, leading to limited\ninterpretability and poor generalizability across different datasets and user\ngroups. We propose HiCoTraj (Zero-Shot Demographic Reasoning via Hierarchical\nChain-of-Thought Prompting from Trajectory), a framework that leverages LLMs'\nzero-shot learning and semantic understanding capabilities to perform\ndemographic inference without labeled training data. HiCoTraj transforms\ntrajectories into semantically rich, natural language representations by\ncreating detailed activity chronicles and multi-scale visiting summaries. Then\nHiCoTraj uses a novel hierarchical chain of thought reasoning to systematically\nguide LLMs through three cognitive stages: factual feature extraction,\nbehavioral pattern analysis, and demographic inference with structured output.\nThis approach addresses the scarcity challenge of labeled demographic data\nwhile providing transparent reasoning chains.

Inspired by this process, we\npropose a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework where each agent\nis assigned a genotype and where reward functions are modelled after the\nconcept of inclusive fitness. An agent's genetic material may be shared with\nother agents, and our inclusive reward function naturally accounts for this. We\nstudy the resulting social dynamics in two types of network games with\nprisoner's dilemmas and find that our results align with well-established\nprinciples from biology, such as Hamilton's rule. Furthermore, we outline how\nthis framework can extend to more open-ended environments with spatial and\ntemporal structure, finite resources, and evolving populations. We hypothesize\nthe emergence of an arms race of strategies, where each new strategy is a\ngradual improvement over earlier adaptations of other agents, effectively\nproducing a multi-agent autocurriculum analogous to biological evolution. In\ncontrast to the binary team-based structures prevalent in earlier research, our\ngene-based reward structure introduces a spectrum of cooperation ranging from\nfull adversity to full cooperativeness based on genetic similarity, enabling\nunique non team-based social dynamics. For example, one agent having a mutual\ncooperative relationship with two other agents, while the two other agents\nbehave adversarially towards each other. We argue that incorporating inclusive\nfitness in agents provides a foundation for the emergence of more strategically\nadvanced and socially intelligent agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774

However, the misuse of LLMs\nwith such powerful capabilities can lead to even greater risks. This is\nespecially concerning in high-stakes and knowledge-intensive domains such as\nbiosecurity, where DR can generate a professional report containing detailed\nforbidden knowledge. Unfortunately, we have found such risks in practice:\nsimply submitting a harmful query, which a standalone LLM directly rejects, can\nelicit a detailed and dangerous report from DR agents. This highlights the\nelevated risks and underscores the need for a deeper safety analysis. Yet,\njailbreak methods designed for LLMs fall short in exposing such unique risks,\nas they do not target the research ability of DR agents. To address this gap,\nwe propose two novel jailbreak strategies: Plan Injection, which injects\nmalicious sub-goals into the agent's plan; and Intent Hijack, which reframes\nharmful queries as academic research questions. We conducted extensive\nexperiments across different LLMs and various safety benchmarks, including\ngeneral and biosecurity forbidden prompts. These experiments reveal 3 key\nfindings: (1) Alignment of the LLMs often fail in DR agents, where harmful\nprompts framed in academic terms can hijack agent intent; (2) Multi-step\nplanning and execution weaken the alignment, revealing systemic vulnerabilities\nthat prompt-level safeguards cannot address; (3) DR agents not only bypass\nrefusals but also produce more coherent, professional, and dangerous content,\ncompared with standalone LLMs. These results demonstrate a fundamental\nmisalignment in DR agents and call for better alignment techniques tailored to\nDR agents.

This survey\ndelivers a comprehensive and up-to-date synthesis of diffusion-based RL. We\nfirst provide an overview of RL, highlighting its challenges, and then\nintroduce the fundamental concepts of DMs, investigating how they are\nintegrated into RL frameworks to address key challenges in this research field.\nWe establish a dual-axis taxonomy that organizes the field along two orthogonal\ndimensions: a function-oriented taxonomy that clarifies the roles DMs play\nwithin the RL pipeline, and a technique-oriented taxonomy that situates\nimplementations across online versus offline learning regimes. We also provide\na comprehensive examination of this progression from single-agent to\nmulti-agent domains, thereby forming several frameworks for DM-RL integration\nand highlighting their practical utility.

To achieve this,\nAx-Prover approaches scientific problem solving through formal proof\ngeneration, a process that demands both creative reasoning and strict syntactic\nrigor. Ax-Prover meets this challenge by equipping Large Language Models\n(LLMs), which provide knowledge and reasoning, with Lean tools via the Model\nContext Protocol (MCP), which ensure formal correctness. To evaluate its\nperformance as an autonomous prover, we benchmark our approach against frontier\nLLMs and specialized prover models on two public math benchmarks and on two\nLean benchmarks we introduce in the fields of abstract algebra and quantum\ntheory.

With the\nnatural language understanding and reasoning capabilities of large language\nmodels (LLMs), there is increasing interest in applying them to CTI, which\ncalls for benchmarks that can rigorously evaluate their performance. Several\nearly efforts have studied LLMs on some CTI tasks but remain limited: (i) they\nadopt only closed-book settings, relying on parametric knowledge without\nleveraging CTI knowledge bases; (ii) they cover only a narrow set of tasks,\nlacking a systematic view of the CTI landscape; and (iii) they restrict\nevaluation to single-source analysis, unlike realistic scenarios that require\nreasoning across multiple sources. To fill these gaps, we present CTIArena, the\nfirst benchmark for evaluating LLM performance on heterogeneous, multi-source\nCTI under knowledge-augmented settings. CTIArena spans three categories,\nstructured, unstructured, and hybrid, further divided into nine tasks that\ncapture the breadth of CTI analysis in modern security operations. We evaluate\nten widely used LLMs and find that most struggle in closed-book setups but show\nnoticeable gains when augmented with security-specific knowledge through our\ndesigned retrieval-augmented techniques.

Despite strong\nempirical performance, existing methods face key limitations. Training is\ncomputationally expensive, as policy updates require sampling numerous\ncandidate solutions per instance to extract a single expert trajectory. More\nfundamentally, these approaches fail to exploit the structure of combinatorial\nproblems involving the coordination of multiple agents, such as vehicles in\nmin-max routing or machines in scheduling. By supervising on single-action\ntrajectories, they fail to exploit agent-permutation symmetries, where distinct\nsequences of actions yield identical solutions, hindering generalization and\nthe ability to learn coordinated behavior.\n  We address these challenges by extending self-improvement to operate over\njoint multi-agent actions. Our model architecture predicts complete agent-task\nassignments jointly at each decision step. To explicitly leverage symmetries,\nwe employ a set-prediction loss, which supervises the policy on multiple expert\nassignments for any given state. This approach enhances sample efficiency and\nthe model's ability to learn coordinated behavior. Furthermore, by generating\nmulti-agent actions in parallel, it drastically accelerates the solution\ngeneration phase of the self-improvement loop.

Traditional penetration testing is costly and\nexpertise-intensive, making it difficult to scale with the growing web\necosystem. While language model agents show promise in cybersecurity, modern\nweb applications demand visual understanding, dynamic content handling, and\nmulti-step interactions that only computer-use agents (CUAs) can perform. Yet,\ntheir ability to discover and exploit vulnerabilities through graphical\ninterfaces remains largely unexplored. We present HackWorld, the first\nframework for systematically evaluating CUAs' capabilities to exploit web\napplication vulnerabilities via visual interaction. Unlike sanitized\nbenchmarks, HackWorld includes 36 real-world applications across 11 frameworks\nand 7 languages, featuring realistic flaws such as injection vulnerabilities,\nauthentication bypasses, and unsafe input handling. Using a Capture-the-Flag\n(CTF) setup, it tests CUAs' capacity to identify and exploit these weaknesses\nwhile navigating complex web interfaces. Evaluation of state-of-the-art CUAs\nreveals concerning trends: exploitation rates below 12% and low cybersecurity\nawareness.

This paper presents\nnovel physics-informed Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) combined with extreme-value\nanalysis techniques to improve gauge-station rainfall predictions across\nThailand. The model leverages a graph-structured representation of gauge\nstations to capture complex spatiotemporal patterns, and it offers\nexplainability through teleconnections. We preprocess relevant climate indices\nthat potentially influence regional rainfall. The proposed Graph Attention\nNetwork with Long Short-Term Memory (Attention-LSTM) applies the attention\nmechanism using initial edge features derived from simple\norographic-precipitation physics formulation. The embeddings are subsequently\nprocessed by LSTM layers. To address extremes, we perform Peak-Over-Threshold\n(POT) mapping using the novel Spatial Season-aware Generalized Pareto\nDistribution (GPD) method, which overcomes limitations of traditional\nmachine-learning models. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms\nwell-established baselines across most regions, including areas prone to\nextremes, and remains strongly competitive with the state of the art.

Prior work has focused on\nlargely deterministic environments with abundant interaction data, simple\nmechanics, and human guidance. We address a more realistic and challenging\nsetting, learning in a complex, stochastic environment where the agent has only\n\"one life\" to explore a hostile environment without human guidance. We\nintroduce OneLife, a framework that models world dynamics through\nconditionally-activated programmatic laws within a probabilistic programming\nframework. Each law operates through a precondition-effect structure,\nactivating in relevant world states. This creates a dynamic computation graph\nthat routes inference and optimization only through relevant laws, avoiding\nscaling challenges when all laws contribute to predictions about a complex,\nhierarchical state, and enabling the learning of stochastic dynamics even with\nsparse rule activation. To evaluate our approach under these demanding\nconstraints, we introduce a new evaluation protocol that measures (a) state\nranking, the ability to distinguish plausible future states from implausible\nones, and (b) state fidelity, the ability to generate future states that\nclosely resemble reality. We develop and evaluate our framework on Crafter-OO,\nour reimplementation of the Crafter environment that exposes a structured,\nobject-oriented symbolic state and a pure transition function that operates on\nthat state alone. OneLife can successfully learn key environment dynamics from\nminimal, unguided interaction, outperforming a strong baseline on 16 out of 23\nscenarios tested. We also test OneLife's planning ability, with simulated\nrollouts successfully identifying superior strategies. Our work establishes a\nfoundation for autonomously constructing programmatic world models of unknown,\ncomplex environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud558\uace0

Promotion abuse is one of the fastest-growing types of fraud in\nrecent years and is characterized by users exploiting promotional activities to\ngain financial benefits from the platform. To investigate this issue, we\nconduct the first study on promotion abuse fraud in e-commerce platforms\nMEITUAN. We find that promotion abuse fraud is a group-based fraudulent\nactivity with two types of fraudulent activities: Stocking Up and Cashback\nAbuse. Unlike traditional fraudulent activities such as fake reviews, promotion\nabuse fraud typically involves ordinary customers conducting legitimate\ntransactions and these two types of fraudulent activities are often\nintertwined. To address this issue, we propose leveraging additional\ninformation from the spatial and temporal perspectives to detect promotion\nabuse fraud. In this paper, we introduce PROMOGUARDIAN, a novel multi-relation\nfused graph neural network that integrates the spatial and temporal information\nof transaction data into a homogeneous graph to detect promotion abuse fraud.\nWe conduct extensive experiments on real-world data from MEITUAN, and the\nresults demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods in promotion abuse fraud detection, achieving 93.15% precision,\ndetecting 2.1 to 5.0 times more fraudsters, and preventing 1.5 to 8.8 times\nmore financial losses in production environments.", "AI": {"tldr":

Identifying these latent dynamics requires solving two intertwined\nproblems: discovering appropriate coarse-grained variables and simultaneously\nfitting the governing equations. Most machine learning approaches tackle these\ntasks jointly by training autoencoders together with models that enforce\ndynamical consistency. We propose to decouple the two problems by leveraging\nthe recently introduced Foundation Inference Models (FIMs). FIMs are pretrained\nmodels that estimate the infinitesimal generators of dynamical systems (e.g.,\nthe drift and diffusion of a stochastic differential equation) in zero-shot\nmode.

By integrating large language models\n(LLMs) with domain-specific computational tools, ToPolyAgent supports both\ninteractive and autonomous simulation workflows across diverse polymer\narchitectures, including linear, ring, brush, and star polymers, as well as\ndendrimers. The system consists of four LLM-powered agents: a Config Agent for\ngenerating initial polymer-solvent configurations, a Simulation Agent for\nexecuting LAMMPS-based MD simulations and conformational analyses, a Report\nAgent for compiling markdown reports, and a Workflow Agent for streamlined\nautonomous operations. Interactive mode incorporates user feedback loops for\niterative refinements, while autonomous mode enables end-to-end task execution\nfrom detailed prompts. We demonstrate ToPolyAgent's versatility through case\nstudies involving diverse polymer architectures under varying solvent\ncondition, thermostats, and simulation lengths. Furthermore, we highlight its\npotential as a research assistant by directing it to investigate the effect of\ninteraction parameters on the linear polymer conformation, and the influence of\ngrafting density on the persistence length of the brush polymer. By coupling\nnatural language interfaces with rigorous simulation tools, ToPolyAgent lowers\nbarriers to complex computational workflows and advances AI-driven materials\ndiscovery in polymer science.

Most prior work addresses acquisition for a single\npredetermined task, limiting scalability. To address this limitation, we\nformalize the meta-AFA problem, where the goal is to learn acquisition policies\nacross various tasks. We introduce Learning-to-Measure (L2M), which consists of\ni) reliable uncertainty quantification over unseen tasks, and ii) an\nuncertainty-guided greedy feature acquisition agent that maximizes conditional\nmutual information. We demonstrate a sequence-modeling or autoregressive\npre-training approach that underpins reliable uncertainty quantification for\ntasks with arbitrary missingness. L2M operates directly on datasets with\nretrospective missingness and performs the meta-AFA task in-context,\neliminating per-task retraining.

In practice, such datasets\nvary widely in quality, often mixing expert, suboptimal, and even random\ntrajectories. The choice of algorithm therefore depends on dataset fidelity.\nBehavior cloning can suffice on high-quality data, whereas mixed- or\nlow-quality data typically benefits from offline RL methods that stitch useful\nbehavior across trajectories. Yet in the wild it is difficult to assess dataset\nquality a priori because the data's provenance and skill composition are\nunknown. We address the problem of estimating offline dataset quality without\ntraining an agent. We study a spectrum of proxies from simple cumulative\nrewards to learned value based estimators, and introduce the Bellman\nWasserstein distance (BWD), a value aware optimal transport score that measures\nhow dissimilar a dataset's behavioral policy is from a random reference policy.\nBWD is computed from a behavioral critic and a state conditional OT\nformulation, requiring no environment interaction or full policy optimization.\nAcross D4RL MuJoCo tasks, BWD strongly correlates with an oracle performance\nscore that aggregates multiple offline RL algorithms, enabling efficient\nprediction of how well standard agents will perform on a given dataset. Beyond\nprediction, integrating BWD as a regularizer during policy optimization\nexplicitly pushes the learned policy away from random behavior and improves\nreturns. These results indicate that value aware, distributional signals such\nas BWD are practical tools for triaging offline RL datasets and policy\noptimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \uc815\uc801 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c\ub9cc \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uba70, \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc758 \ud488\uc9c8\uc774 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \uc120\ud0dd\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce5c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \ucd94\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \ubca8\ub9cc \uc640\uc11c\uc288\ud0c0\uc778 \uac70\ub9ac(BWD)\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc9c0\ud45c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc815\ucc45\uacfc \ub79c\ub364 \ucc38\uc870 \uc815\ucc45 \uac04\uc758 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131\uc744 \uce21\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4.

However, current LLM agents still show limited ability to\nhandle goal-oriented queries, which require decomposing a high-level objective\ninto multiple interdependent API calls with correct planning and execution.\nCurrent approaches mainly rely on zero-shot evaluation due to the absence of\ntraining data. While proprietary closed-source models such as GPT-4 demonstrate\nstrong reasoning abilities, smaller open-source models struggle to perform\ncomplex tool use effectively. Thus, we propose a novel training framework GOAT,\nwhich enables fine-tuning of LLM agents in a human annotation-free setting.\nGOAT automatically constructs synthetic datasets of goal-oriented API execution\ntasks directly from given API documents, equipping models with the ability to\nreason over interdependent calls and generate coherent responses. Through\nextensive experiments, we show that GOAT-trained agents achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance across multiple existing goal-oriented benchmarks.\nIn addition, we introduce GOATBench, a new goal-oriented API execution\nbenchmark, and demonstrate that agents trained with GOAT also excel in this\nsetting.

Existing evaluation methods typically rely on post hoc\nreview of full conversation transcripts, thereby neglecting the dynamic,\ncontext-sensitive nature of medical dialogues and the evolving informational\nneeds of patients. In this work, we present MedKGEval, a novel multi-turn\nevaluation framework for clinical LLMs grounded in structured medical\nknowledge. Our approach introduces three key contributions: (1) a knowledge\ngraph-driven patient simulation mechanism, where a dedicated control module\nretrieves relevant medical facts from a curated knowledge graph, thereby\nendowing the patient agent with human-like and realistic conversational\nbehavior. This knowledge graph is constructed by integrating open-source\nresources with additional triples extracted from expert-annotated datasets; (2)\nan in-situ, turn-level evaluation framework, where each model response is\nassessed by a Judge Agent for clinical appropriateness, factual correctness,\nand safety as the dialogue progresses using a suite of fine-grained,\ntask-specific metrics; (3) a comprehensive multi-turn benchmark of eight\nstate-of-the-art LLMs, demonstrating MedKGEval's ability to identify subtle\nbehavioral flaws and safety risks that are often overlooked by conventional\nevaluation pipelines. Although initially designed for Chinese and English\nmedical applications, our framework can be readily extended to additional\nlanguages by switching the input knowledge graphs, ensuring seamless bilingual\nsupport and domain-specific applicability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc758\ub8cc \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0\uc11c \ub300\ud654\ud615 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 MedKGEval\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc758\ub8cc \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc758\uc0ac-\ud658\uc790 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "MedKGEval\uc740 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc758\ub8cc \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \ud134 \ud3c9\uac00 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ud658\uc790 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998, \ud134-\ub808\ubca8 \ud3c9\uac00 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc0f \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 LLM\uc758 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uc5ec \ud3c9\uac00\uc758 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc774\uc288\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "MedKGEval\uc740 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uac04\uacfc\ub418\ub294 \ubbf8\uc138\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9 \uacb0\ud568\uacfc \uc548\uc804 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc758\ub8cc \uc751\uc6a9 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ud574\uacb0\ud574\uc57c \ud560 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \ub0a8\uc544\uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc2e4\uc81c \uc784\uc0c1 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc804\uac1c\ub418\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \ud134 \uc758\uc0ac-\ud658\uc790 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud2b9\ud788 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\uccb4 \ub300\ud654 \uae30\ub85d\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0ac\ud6c4 \uac80\ud1a0\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\ubbc0\ub85c \uc758\ub8cc \ub300\ud654\uc758 \ub3d9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \ud2b9\uc131\uacfc \ud658\uc790\uc758 \uc9c4\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc694\uad6c\ub97c \uac04\uacfc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc758\ub8cc \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \uc784\uc0c1 LLM\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud134 \ud3c9\uac00 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 MedKGEval\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \uae30\uc5ec\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: (1) \uc804\ubb38\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc8fc\uc11d\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd94\ucd9c\ub41c \ucd94\uac00 \ud2b8\ub9ac\ud50c\uacfc \ud568\uaed8 \uc624\ud508 \uc18c\uc2a4 \uc790\uc6d0\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \uc9c0\uc2dd \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uad00\ub828 \uc758\ub8cc \uc0ac\uc2e4\uc744 \uac80\uc0c9\ud558\ub294 \uc804\uc6a9 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uae30\ubc18 \ud658\uc790 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998, (2) \ub300\ud654\uac00 \uc9c4\ud589\ub428\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uac01 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc751\ub2f5\uc774 \uc784\uc0c1 \uc801\ud569\uc131, \uc0ac\uc2e4 \uc815\ud655\uc131 \ubc0f \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 Judge Agent\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ud3c9\uac00\ub418\ub294 \ud604\uc7a5 \ud134-\ub808\ubca8 \ud3c9\uac00 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c, (3) \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ud3c9\uac00 \ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\uac00 \uac04\uacfc\ud558\ub294 \ubbf8\uc138\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9 \uacb0\ud568\uacfc \uc548\uc804 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 MedKGEval\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\ub294 \uc5ec\ub35f \uac00\uc9c0 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 LLM\uc758 \uc885\ud569\uc801\uc778 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud134 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c. \ucc98\uc74c\uc5d0\ub294 \uc911\uad6d\uc5b4 \ubc0f \uc601\uc5b4 \uc758\ub8cc \uc751\uc6a9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub418\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc785\ub825 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \uc804\ud658\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ucd94\uac00 \uc5b8\uc5b4\ub85c \uc27d\uac8c \ud655\uc7a5\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc6d0\ud65c\ud55c \uc774\uc911 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \uc9c0\uc6d0 \ubc0f \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc801\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Despite its transformative potential, the\neffectiveness of this emergent paradigm remains under-explored, with empirical\nevidence revealing unexpected productivity losses and fundamental challenges in\nhuman-AI collaboration. To address this gap, this survey provides the first\ncomprehensive and systematic review of Vibe Coding with large language models,\nestablishing both theoretical foundations and practical frameworks for this\ntransformative development approach. Drawing from systematic analysis of over\n1000 research papers, we survey the entire vibe coding ecosystem, examining\ncritical infrastructure components including LLMs for coding, LLM-based coding\nagent, development environment of coding agent, and feedback mechanisms. We\nfirst introduce Vibe Coding as a formal discipline by formalizing it through a\nConstrained Markov Decision Process that captures the dynamic triadic\nrelationship among human developers, software projects, and coding agents.\nBuilding upon this theoretical foundation, we then synthesize existing\npractices into five distinct development models: Unconstrained Automation,\nIterative Conversational Collaboration, Planning-Driven, Test-Driven, and\nContext-Enhanced Models, thus providing the first comprehensive taxonomy in\nthis domain. Critically, our analysis reveals that successful Vibe Coding\ndepends not merely on agent capabilities but on systematic context engineering,\nwell-established development environments, and human-agent collaborative\ndevelopment models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Vibe Coding\uc740 AI \uc0dd\uc131 \uad6c\ud604\uc744 \uad00\ucc30\ud558\uc5ec \uac80\uc99d\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uac1c\ubc1c

In real-world\nnetworks, information often spans multiple interrelated topics, posing\nchallenges for opinion evolution and highlighting the need for frameworks that\nsimulate interactions among topics. Existing studies based on large language\nmodels (LLMs) focus largely on single topics, limiting the capture of cognitive\ntransfer in multi-topic, cross-domain contexts. Traditional numerical models,\nmeanwhile, simplify complex linguistic attitudes into discrete values, lacking\ninterpretability, behavioral consistency, and the ability to integrate multiple\ntopics. To address these issues, we propose Multi-topic Opinion Simulation\n(MTOS), a social simulation framework integrating multi-topic contexts with\nLLMs. MTOS leverages LLMs alongside short-term and long-term memory,\nincorporates multiple user-selection interaction mechanisms and dynamic\ntopic-selection strategies, and employs a belief decay mechanism to enable\nperspective updates across topics. We conduct extensive experiments on MTOS,\nvarying topic numbers, correlation types, and performing ablation studies to\nassess features such as group polarization and local consistency.

The framework is built upon the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm.\nIts core innovation lies in the use of biased attention to construct a traffic\nrisk predictor.

In this work, we\nreframe working memory management as a learnable, intrinsic capability. We\npropose a novel framework, Memory-as-Action, where an agent actively manages\nits working memory by executing explicit editing operations as part of a\nunified policy. This formulation allows an agent, trained via reinforcement\nlearning, to balance memory curation against long-term task objectives under\ngiven resource constraints. However, such memory editing actions break the\nstandard assumption of a continuously growing prefix in LLM interactions,\nleading to what we call trajectory fractures. These non-prefix changes disrupt\nthe causal continuity required by standard policy gradient methods, making\nthose methods inapplicable. To address this, we propose a new algorithm,\nDynamic Context Policy Optimization, which enables stable end-to-end\nreinforcement learning by segmenting trajectories at memory action points and\napplying trajectory-level advantages to the resulting action segments.

However, top-performing systems rely on large-scale\nmodels that are costly to deploy, while smaller VLMs lack the necessary\nknowledge and skills to succeed. To bridge this gap, we present\n\\textit{Embodied Reasoning Agent (ERA)}, a two-stage framework that integrates\nprior knowledge learning and online reinforcement learning (RL). The first\nstage, \\textit{Embodied Prior Learning}, distills foundational knowledge from\nthree types of data: (1) Trajectory-Augmented Priors, which enrich existing\ntrajectory data with structured reasoning generated by stronger models; (2)\nEnvironment-Anchored Priors, which provide in-environment knowledge and\ngrounding supervision; and (3) External Knowledge Priors, which transfer\ngeneral knowledge from out-of-environment datasets. In the second stage, we\ndevelop an online RL pipeline that builds on these priors to further enhance\nagent performance. To overcome the inherent challenges in agent RL, including\nlong horizons, sparse rewards, and training instability, we introduce three key\ndesigns: self-summarization for context management, dense reward shaping, and\nturn-level policy optimization. Extensive experiments on both high-level\nplanning (EB-ALFRED) and low-level control (EB-Manipulation) tasks demonstrate\nthat ERA-3B surpasses both prompting-based large models and previous\ntraining-based baselines.

While LLMs-as-Judges offer\npromise in automating evaluations, current approaches often rely on simplistic\naggregation methods (e.g., majority voting), which can fail even when\nindividual agents provide correct answers. To address this, we propose a\nmulti-agent debate judge framework where agents collaboratively reason and\niteratively refine their responses. We formalize the debate process\nmathematically, analyzing agent interactions and proving that debate amplifies\ncorrectness compared to static ensembles. To enhance efficiency, we introduce a\nstability detection mechanism that models judge consensus dynamics via a\ntime-varying Beta-Binomial mixture, with adaptive stopping based on\ndistributional similarity (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). This mechanism models the\njudges' collective correct rate dynamics using a time-varying mixture of\nBeta-Binomial distributions and employs an adaptive stopping criterion based on\ndistributional similarity (Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic).

However, these\nsensors face inherent limitations: their field of view and line of sight can be\nobstructed by other vehicles, thereby reducing situational awareness. In this\ncontext, vehicle-to-vehicle communication plays a crucial role, as it enables\ncars to share information and remain aware of each other even when sensors are\noccluded. One way to achieve this is through the use of Cooperative Awareness\nMessages (CAMs). In this paper, we investigate the use of CAM data for vehicle\ntrajectory prediction. Specifically, we design and train a neural network,\nCooperative Awareness Message-based Graph Neural Network (CAMNet), on a widely\nused motion forecasting dataset. We then evaluate the model on a second dataset\nthat we created from scratch using Cooperative Awareness Messages, in order to\nassess whether this type of data can be effectively exploited. Our approach\ndemonstrates promising results, showing that CAMs can indeed support vehicle\ntrajectory prediction. At the same time, we discuss several limitations of the\napproach, which highlight opportunities for future research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc790\uc728 \uc8fc\ud589\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud55c CAM \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ucc28\ub7c9 \uada4\uc801 \uc608\uce21 \uc5f0\uad6c.", "motivation": "\uc790\uc728 \uc8fc\ud589\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ucc28\ub7c9\uac04 \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud568.", "method": "Cooperative Awareness Message (CAM) \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ucc28\ub7c9 \uada4\uc801 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(CAMNet)\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uace0 \ud6c8\ub828\ud568.", "result": "CAM\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \ucc28\ub7c9 \uada4\uc801 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud568.", "conclusion": "CAM\uc774 \ucc28\ub7c9 \uada4\uc801 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc784\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uba70 \ud5a5\ud6c4 \uc5f0\uad6c \uae30\ud68c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud568.", "translated_summary": "\uc790\uc728\uc8fc\ud589\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc548\uc804 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc778 \uc791\uc5c5\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud604\ub300 \ucc28\ub7c9\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub77c\uc774\ub2e4, \uce74\uba54\ub77c, \ub808\uc774\ub354\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ube44\uc2fc \uc13c\uc11c\ub85c \uc7a5\ucc29\ub418\uc5b4 \uc0ac\uace0 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc13c\uc11c\ub294 \uace0\uc720\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e4\ub978 \ucc28\ub7c9\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc2dc\uc57c\uc640 \uc120\uc774 \uac00\ub824\uc838 \uc0c1\ud669 \uc778\uc2dd\uc774 \uc800\ud558\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0\uc11c \ucc28\ub7c9 \uac04 \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc740 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ucc28\ub7c9\ub4e4\uc774 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uacf5\uc720\ud558\uace0 \uc13c\uc11c\uac00 \uac00\ub824\uc9c4 \uacbd\uc6b0\uc5d0\ub3c4 \uc11c\ub85c \uc778\uc2dd\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ud611\ub825 \uc778\uc2dd \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0(CAM)\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 CAM \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ucc28\ub7c9 \uada4\uc801\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \ubaa8\uc158 \uc608\uce21 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \ud611\ub825 \uc778\uc2dd \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0 \uae30\ubc18 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(CAMNet)\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uace0 \ud6c8\ub828\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7f0 \ub2e4\uc74c \uc774 \uc720\ud615\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uac00 \ucc98\uc74c\ubd80\ud130 Scratch\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c \ub450 \ubc88\uc9f8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 CAM\uc774 \uc2e4\uc81c\ub85c \ucc28\ub7c9 \uada4\uc801 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\ub294 \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ub17c\uc758\ud558\uba70 \ud5a5\ud6c4 \uc5f0\uad6c \uae30\ud68c\ub97c \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}
