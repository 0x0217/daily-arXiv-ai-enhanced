However, these agents frequently access interfaces containing sensitive personal information, and screenshots are often transmitted to remote models, creating substantial privacy risks. These risks are particularly severe in GUI workflows: GUIs expose richer, more accessible private information, and privacy risks depend on interaction trajectories across sequential scenes. We propose GUIGuard, a three-stage framework for privacy-preserving GUI agents: (1) privacy recognition, (2) privacy protection, and (3) task execution under protection. We further construct GUIGuard-Bench, a cross-platform benchmark with 630 trajectories and 13,830 screenshots, annotated with region-level privacy grounding and fine-grained labels of risk level, privacy category, and task necessity. Evaluations reveal that existing agents exhibit limited privacy recognition, with state-of-the-art models achieving only 13.3% accuracy on Android and 1.4% on PC. Under privacy protection, task-planning semantics can still be maintained, with closed-source models showing stronger semantic consistency than open-source ones. Case studies on MobileWorld show that carefully designed protection strategies achieve higher task accuracy while preserving privacy. Our results highlight privacy recognition as a critical bottleneck for practical GUI agents.

Existing SAST-based checks are noisy and often miss immature, context-dependent vulnerabilities, while standalone Large Language Models (LLMs) are constrained by context windows and lack explicit tool use. Agentic AI, which combine LLMs with autonomous decision-making, tool invocation, and code navigation, offer a promising alternative, but their effectiveness for pre-commit secure code review is not yet well understood. In this work, we introduce AgenticSCR, an agentic AI for secure code review for detecting immature vulnerabilities during the pre-commit stage, augmented by security-focused semantic memories. Using our own curated benchmark of immature vulnerabilities, tailored to the pre-commit secure code review, we empirically evaluate how accurate is our AgenticSCR for localizing, detecting, and explaining immature vulnerabilities. Our results show that AgenticSCR achieves at least 153% relatively higher percentage of correct code review comments than the static LLM-based baseline, and also substantially surpasses SAST tools.

Writing efficient FHE code is a complex task requiring cryptographic expertise, and finding the optimal sequence of program transformations is often intractable. In this paper, we propose CHEHAB RL, a novel framework that leverages deep reinforcement learning (RL) to automate FHE code optimization. Instead of relying on predefined heuristics or combinatorial search, our method trains an RL agent to learn an effective policy for applying a sequence of rewriting rules to automatically vectorize scalar FHE code while reducing instruction latency and noise growth. The proposed approach supports the optimization of both structured and unstructured code. To train the agent, we synthesize a diverse dataset of computations using a large language model (LLM). We integrate our proposed approach into the CHEHAB FHE compiler and evaluate it on a suite of benchmarks, comparing its performance against Coyote, a state-of-the-art vectorizing FHE compiler. The results show that our approach generates code that is $5.3\\times$ faster in execution, accumulates $2.54\\times$ less noise, while the compilation process itself is $27.9\\times$ faster than Coyote (geometric means).", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub525 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc644\uc804 \ub3d9\ud615 \uc554\ud638\ud654(FHE) \ucf54\ub4dc \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud558\ub294 CHEHAB RL \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "FHE\uc758 \ub192\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc7a5\ubcbd\uc774\uba70, \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc791\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc554\ud638\ud559\uc801 \uc804\ubb38 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub525 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec FHE \ucf54\ub4dc\uc758 rewriting \uaddc\uce59\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 RL \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc2e4\ud589 \uc18d\ub3c4\uac00 $5.3\times$ \ube60\ub974\uace0, \ub178\uc774\uc988 \uc99d\uac00\uac00 $2.54\times$ \uc801\uc73c\uba70, Coyote\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ucef4\ud30c\uc77c \uacfc\uc815\uc774 $27.9\times$ \ube60\ub985\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ubc0f \ube44\uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ucf54\ub4dc \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uc5ec FHE \ucf54\ub4dc\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac1c\uc120\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc644\uc804 \ub3d9\ud615 \uc554\ud638\ud654(FHE)\ub294 \uc554\ud638\ud654\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uacc4\uc0b0\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uadf8 \ub192\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc7a5\ubcbd\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 FHE \ucf54\ub4dc\ub97c \uc791\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc554\ud638\ud559\uc801 \uc804\ubb38 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc774\uba70, \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8 \ubcc0\ud658\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801 \uc21c\uc11c\ub97c \ucc3e\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \ubd88\uac00\ub2a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub525 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec FHE \ucf54\ub4dc \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 CHEHAB RL\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubbf8\ub9ac \uc815\uc758\ub41c \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1\uc774\ub098 \uc870\ud569 \uac80\uc0c9\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294 \ub300\uc2e0, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 RL \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828\uc2dc\ucf1c \uc9c0\uce68 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uacfc \ub178\uc774\uc988 \uc99d\uac00\ub97c \uc904\uc774\uba74\uc11c \uc2a4\uce7c\ub77c FHE \ucf54\ub4dc\ub97c \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ubca1\ud130\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubcc0\ud658 \uaddc\uce59 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\ub97c \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ubc0f \ube44\uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ucf54\ub4dc\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uacc4\uc0b0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \ud569\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 CHEHAB FHE \ucef4\ud30c\uc77c\ub7ec\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uace0 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \uc2a4\uc704\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc5ec \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ubca1\ud130\ud654 FHE \ucef4\ud30c\uc77c\ub7ec\uc778 Coyote\uc640 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ube44\uad50\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \uc2e4\ud589 \uc18d\ub3c4\uac00 $5.3\times$ \ube60\ub974\uace0, \ub204\uc801 \ub178\uc774\uc988\uac00 $2.54\times$ \uc801\uc73c\uba70, \ucef4\ud30c\uc77c \uacfc\uc815 \uc790\uccb4\uac00 Coyote\ubcf4\ub2e4 $27.9\times$ \ube60\ub978 \ucf54\ub4dc\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Some of these technologies enable the automation of individual tasks, while others focus on orchestrating the execution of end-to-end processes. The rise of Generative and Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) is opening the way for another such wave. However, this wave is poised to be different because it shifts the focus from automation to autonomy and from design-driven management of business processes to data-driven management, leveraging process mining techniques. This position paper, based on a keynote talk at the 2025 Workshop on AI for BPM, outlines how process mining has laid the foundations on top of which agents can sense process states, reason about improvement opportunities, and act to maintain and optimize performance. The paper proposes an architectural vision for Agentic Business Process Management Systems (A-BPMS): a new class of platforms that integrate autonomy, reasoning, and learning into process management and execution. The paper contends that such systems must support a continuum of processes, spanning from human-driven to fully autonomous, thus redefining the boundaries of process automation and governance.", "AI":

The implemented QRL approaches are quantum analogues of the classical neural-network-based Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient and Deep Q-Network algorithms. Through an empirical evaluation on real-world financial data, we show that our quantum agents achieve risk-adjusted performance comparable to, and in some cases exceeding, that of classical Deep RL models with several orders of magnitude more parameters. In addition to improved parameter efficiency, quantum agents exhibit reduced variability across market regimes, indicating robust behaviour under changing conditions. However, while quantum circuit execution is inherently fast at the hardware level, practical deployment on cloud-based quantum systems introduces substantial latency, making end-to-end runtime currently dominated by infrastructural overhead and limiting practical applicability. Taken together, our results suggest that QRL is theoretically competitive with state-of-the-art classical reinforcement learning and may become practically advantageous as deployment overheads diminish. This positions QRL as a promising paradigm for dynamic decision-making in complex, high-dimensional, and non-stationary environments such as financial markets.

Traditional test-time defenses largely operate under the paradigm of internal diagnosis methods like model repairing or input robustness, yet these approaches are often fragile under advanced attacks as they remain entangled with the victim model's corrupted parameters. We propose a paradigm shift from Internal Diagnosis to External Semantic Auditing, arguing that effective defense requires decoupling safety from the victim model via an independent, semantically grounded auditor. To this end, we present a framework harnessing Universal Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as evolving semantic gatekeepers. We introduce PRISM (Prototype Refinement & Inspection via Statistical Monitoring), which overcomes the domain gap of general VLMs through two key mechanisms: a Hybrid VLM Teacher that dynamically refines visual prototypes online, and an Adaptive Router powered by statistical margin monitoring to calibrate gating thresholds in real-time. Extensive evaluation across 17 datasets and 11 attack types demonstrates that PRISM achieves state-of-the-art performance, suppressing Attack Success Rate to <1% on CIFAR-10 while improving clean accuracy, establishing a new standard for model-agnostic, externalized security.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub525 \ub274\ub7f4 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ubc31\ub3c4\uc5b4 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubc29\uc5b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc218\ub9ac\ub098 \uc785\ub825 \uac15\uac74\uc131\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ub0b4\ubd80 \uc9c4\ub2e8 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub098, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc678\ubd80 \uc758\ubbf8 \uac10\uc0ac\ub85c\uc758 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784 \uc804\ud658\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\uc5b4\ub294 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \uac10\uc0ac\uc790\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud53c\ud574 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ubd84\ub9ac\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubaa9\uc801\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ubcf4\ud3b8\uc801\uc778 \ube44\uc804-\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(VLM)\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c, PRISM\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc77c\ubc18 VLM\uc758 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uac04 \uac2d\uc744 \uadf9\ubcf5\ud55c\ub2e4.

We investigate how payoff magnitude and linguistic context shape LLM strategies in repeated social dilemmas, using a payoff-scaled Prisoner's Dilemma to isolate sensitivity to incentive strength. Across models and languages, we observe consistent behavioral patterns, including incentive-sensitive conditional strategies and cross-linguistic divergence. To interpret these dynamics, we train supervised classifiers on canonical repeated-game strategies and apply them to LLM decisions, revealing systematic, model- and language-dependent behavioral intentions, with linguistic framing sometimes matching or exceeding architectural effects.

Existing benchmarks conflate task complexity with structural ordering, making it difficult to isolate the impact of prompt topology on performance. We introduce RIFT, Reordered Instruction Following Testbed, to assess instruction following by disentangling structure from content. Using rephrased Jeopardy! question-answer pairs, we test LLMs across two prompt structures: linear prompts, which progress sequentially, and jumping prompts, which preserve identical content but require non-sequential traversal. Across 10,000 evaluations spanning six state-of-the-art open-source LLMs, accuracy dropped by up to 72% under jumping conditions (compared to baseline), revealing a strong dependence on positional continuity. Error analysis shows that approximately 50% of failures stem from instruction-order violations and semantic drift, indicating that current architectures internalize instruction following as a sequential pattern rather than a reasoning skill. These results reveal structural sensitivity as a fundamental limitation in current architectures, with direct implications for applications requiring non-sequential control flow such as workflow automation and multi-agent systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc9c0\uce68 \uc218\ud589 \ub2a5\ub825\uc740 \uc544\uc9c1 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \ud0d0\uad6c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\ub2e4.

Collapsing these uncertainties to a single point estimate can distort what is learned. We systematically study how uncertainty propagates through knowledge distillation across three representative model classes--linear regression, feed-forward neural networks, and large language models (LLMs)--and propose simple corrections. We distinguish inter-student uncertainty (variance across independently distilled students) from intra-student uncertainty (variance of a single student's predictive distribution), showing that standard single-response knowledge distillation suppresses intra-student variance while leaving substantial inter-student variability. To address these mismatches, we introduce two variance-aware strategies: averaging multiple teacher responses, which reduces noise at rate $O(1/k)$, and variance-weighting, which combines teacher and student estimates via inverse-variance weighting to yield a minimum-variance estimator. We provide formal guarantees in linear regression, validate the methods in neural networks, and demonstrate empirical gains in LLM distillation, including reduced systematic noise and hallucination. These results reframe knowledge distillation as an uncertainty transformation and show that variance-aware distillation produces more stable students that better reflect teacher uncertainty.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc99d\ub958 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc804\ud30c\ub97c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \ub2e8\uc77c \uc751\ub2f5\uc758 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc99d\ub958\uac00 \ub0b4\ubd80 \ud559\uc0dd \ubd84\uc0b0\uc744 \uc5b5\uc81c\ud558\uace0 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ud559\uc0dd \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc744 \ub0a8\uae30\ub294 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \ubcf4\uc815 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc9c0\uc2dd \uc99d\ub958\uc758 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \ubcf4\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud559\uc0dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud6c8\ub828\uacfc \ucd94\ub860 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0, \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc778\uc9c0 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uac80\uc99d \ubc0f LLM \uc99d\ub958\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uc774\ub04c\uc5b4\ub0c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubd84\uc0b0 \uc778\uc9c0 \uc99d\ub958\ub294 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc99d\ub958\ub97c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ubcc0\ud658\uc73c\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\uace0, \ub354 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \ud559\uc0dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uad50\uc0ac \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \ub354 \uc798 \ubc18\uc601\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc9c0\uc2dd \uc99d\ub958\ub294 \uad50\uc0ac \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \ud559\uc0dd \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc804\uc774\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774 \uacfc\uc815\uc740 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\ub960\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad50\uc0ac\uc758 \ucd9c\ub825, \ud559\uc0dd \ud6c8\ub828 \ubc0f \ud559\uc0dd \ucd94\ub860\uc740 \ubaa8\ub450 \ub79c\ub364\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc810 \ucd94\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \ucd95\uc18c\ud558\uba74 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \ub0b4\uc6a9\uc774 \uc65c\uace1\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc120\ud615 \ud68c\uadc0, \ud53c\ub4dc\ud3ec\uc6cc\ub4dc \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \ubc0f \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub300\ud45c \ubaa8\ub378 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc99d\ub958\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc774 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc804\ud30c\ub418\ub294\uc9c0 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \uc218\uc815\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc99d\ub958\ub41c \ud559\uc0dd \uac04\uc758 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131(\ud559\uc0dd \uac04 \ubd84\uc0b0)\uacfc \ub2e8\uc77c \ud559\uc0dd\uc758 \uc608\uce21 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc758 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131(\ud559\uc0dd \ub0b4 \ubd84\uc0b0)\uc744 \uad6c\ubcc4\ud558\uc5ec, \ud45c\uc900 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc751\ub2f5 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc99d\ub958\uac00 \ud559\uc0dd \ub0b4 \ubd84\uc0b0\uc744 \uc5b5\uc81c\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ud559\uc0dd \uac04 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc744 \ub0a8\uae34\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc778\uc2dd \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uc5ec\ub7ec \uad50\uc0ac \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \ud3c9\uade0\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \ub178\uc774\uc988\ub97c $O(1/k)$ \ube44\uc728\ub85c \uc904\uc774\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc \uad50\uc0ac\uc640 \ud559\uc0dd \ucd94\uc815\uce58\ub97c \uc5ed \ubd84\uc0b0 \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ucd5c\uc18c \ubd84\uc0b0 \ucd94\uc815\uae30\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ubd84\uc0b0 \uac00\uc911\uce58 \ubc29\ubc95\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc120\ud615 \ud68c\uadc0\uc5d0\uc11c \ud615\uc2dd\uc801 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uba70, LLM \uc99d\ub958\uc5d0\uc11c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801 \ub178\uc774\uc988 \ubc0f \ud658\uac01 \uac10\uc18c\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \uc774\ub4dd\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc99d\ub958\ub97c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ubcc0\ud658\uc73c\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\uace0, \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc778\uc2dd \uc99d\ub958\uac00 \uad50\uc0ac \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \ub354 \uc798 \ubc18\uc601\ud558\ub294 \ub354 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \ud559\uc0dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, the respective methods to solve such problems are often developed in an isolated, task-specific manner and thus lack a unifying theoretical foundation. Here, we provide a stepping stone towards the formation of such a foundation and further development by introducing the Neural Graph Inverse Problem (GraIP) conceptual framework, which formalizes and reframes a broad class of graph learning tasks as inverse problems. Unlike discriminative approaches that directly predict target variables from given graph inputs, the GraIP paradigm addresses inverse problems, i.e., it relies on observational data and aims to recover the underlying graph structure by reversing the forward process, such as message passing or network dynamics, that produced the observed outputs. We demonstrate the versatility of GraIP across various graph learning tasks, including rewiring, causal discovery, and neural relational inference. We also propose benchmark datasets and metrics for each GraIP domain considered, and characterize and empirically evaluate existing baseline methods used to solve them. Overall, our unifying perspective bridges seemingly disparate applications and provides a principled approach to structural learning in constrained and combinatorial settings while encouraging cross-pollination of existing methods across graph inverse problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 Neural Graph Inverse Problem (GraIP) \uac1c\ub150\uc801 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc5ed\ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uad6c\uc870 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ud1b5\uc77c\ub41c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \ub9c8\ub828\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc720\ucd94\ud558\ub294 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc791\uc5c5\uc740 \ub9ce\uc774 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uac1c\ubcc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac1c\ubc1c\ub418\uc5b4 \ud1b5\ud569\ub41c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uae30\ubc18\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "Neural Graph Inverse Problem (GraIP) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc5ed\ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ud68c\ubcf5\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "GraIP\ub294 \ub9ac\uc640\uc774\uc5b4\ub9c1, \uc778\uacfc \ubc1c\uacac, \uc2e0\uacbd \uad00\uacc4 \ucd94\ub860 \ub4f1 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uadf8 \ub2e4\uc7ac\ub2e4\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\uace0, \uac01\uac01\uc758 GraIP \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc640 \uc9c0\ud45c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 GraIP\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc11c\ub85c \uad50\ub958\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\uc5ec \uc81c\uc57d\ub41c \uc870\ud569 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc6d0\uce59\uc801\uc778 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \uc751\uc6a9 \uae30\ubc95\ub4e4\uc744 \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ud1b5\uc77c\ub41c \uad00\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc791\uc5c5, \uc608\ub97c \ub4e4\uc5b4 \uad6c\uc870 \ubc1c\uacac, \uc2dc\uac04 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ubd84\uc11d, \uc870\ud569 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ub4f1\uc740 \uc8fc\uc5b4\uc9c4 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc608\uce21\uc744 \ud558\uae30\ubcf4\ub2e4\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uc720\ucd94\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uace0\ub9bd\ub41c \uc791\uc5c5 \ud2b9\ud654 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uac1c\ubc1c\ub418\uc5b4 \ud1b5\ud569\ub41c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uae30\ubc18\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4. \uc5ec\uae30\uc11c\ub294 Neural Graph Inverse Problem (GraIP) \uac1c\ub150\uc801 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ud615\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub514\ub524\ub3cc\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0 \ucd94\uac00 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \ubaa8\uc0c9\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.

Fundamentally, this constitutes a reasoning process composed of \\textit{hypothesis-verification cycles}, requiring models to possess both geospatial reasoning capabilities and the ability to verify evidence against geographic facts. Existing methods typically internalize location knowledge and reasoning patterns into static memory via supervised training or trajectory-based reinforcement fine-tuning. Consequently, these methods are prone to factual hallucinations and generalization bottlenecks in open-world settings or scenarios requiring dynamic knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose a Hierarchical Localization Agent, called LocationAgent. Our core philosophy is to retain hierarchical reasoning logic within the model while offloading the verification of geographic evidence to external tools. To implement hierarchical reasoning, we design the RER architecture (Reasoner-Executor-Recorder), which employs role separation and context compression to prevent the drifting problem in multi-step reasoning. For evidence verification, we construct a suite of clue exploration tools that provide diverse evidence to support location reasoning. Furthermore, to address data leakage and the scarcity of Chinese data in existing datasets, we introduce CCL-Bench (China City Location Bench), an image geolocation benchmark encompassing various scene granularities and difficulty levels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LocationAgent significantly outperforms existing methods by at least 30\\% in zero-shot settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294

We cast this problem as learning the parameters of a discrete Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). The agent begins with knowledge of the POMDP's actions and observation spaces, but not its state space, transitions, or observation models. These properties must be constructed from action-observation sequences. Spectral approaches to learning models of partially observable domains, such as learning Predictive State Representations (PSRs), are known to directly estimate the number of hidden states. These methods cannot, however, yield direct estimates of transition and observation likelihoods, which are important for many downstream reasoning tasks. Other approaches leverage tensor decompositions to estimate transition and observation likelihoods but often assume full state observability and full-rank transition matrices for all actions. To relax these assumptions, we study how PSRs learn transition and observation matrices up to a similarity transform, which may be estimated via tensor methods. Our method learns observation matrices and transition matrices up to a partition of states, where the states in a single partition have the same observation distributions corresponding to actions whose transition matrices are full-rank. Our experiments suggest that these partition-level transition models learned by our method, with a sufficient amount of data, meets the performance of PSRs as models to be used by standard sampling-based POMDP solvers. Furthermore, the explicit observation and transition likelihoods can be leveraged to specify planner behavior after the model has been learned.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740

While recent large language models (LLMs) show potential for procedural graph extraction, they often produce ill-formed structures or misinterpret logical flows. We present \\model{}, a multi-agent framework that formulates procedural graph extraction as a multi-round reasoning process with dedicated structural and logical refinement. The framework iterates through three stages: (1) a graph extraction phase with the graph builder agent, (2) a structural feedback phase in which a simulation agent diagnoses and explains structural defects, and (3) a logical feedback phase in which a semantic agent aligns semantics between flow logic and linguistic cues in the source text.

Models trained on these datasets often generate brief responses that offers insufficient accuracy and limited interpretability into how these models arrive at the final answer. We introduce CoReTab, a code-driven reasoning framework that produces scalable, interpretable, and automatically verifiable annotations by coupling multi-step reasoning with executable Python code. Using the CoReTab framework, we curate a dataset of 115K verified samples averaging 529 tokens per response and fine-tune open-source MLLMs through a three-stage pipeline. We evaluate the resulting model trained on CoReTab across 17 MMTab benchmarks spanning table question answering, fact verification, and table structure understanding. Our model achieves significant gains of +6.2%, +5.7%, and +25.6%, respectively, over MMTab-trained baselines, while producing transparent and verifiable reasoning traces.

This deployment data is naturally generated by users in applications such as LLMs-based writing assistants and coding agents. The _natural_ origin of user edits makes it a desired source for adapting and personalizing LLMs. In this setup, there emerges a unification of various feedback types namely preferences, supervised labels, and cost that are typically studied separately in the literature. In this paper, we initiate the theoretical investigation of learning from user edits. We first derive bounds for learning algorithms that learn from each of these feedback types. We prove that these algorithms have different trade-offs depending upon the user, data distribution, and model class. We then propose a simple ensembling procedure to jointly learn from these feedback types. On two domains adapted from Gao et al. 2024, we show our ensembling procedure outperforms these methods that learn from individual feedback. Further, we show that our proposed procedure can robustly adapt to different user-edit distributions at test time.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ud3b8\uc9d1 \ubc30\ud3ec \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec LLM\uc744 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc791\uc131 \ub3c4\uc6b0\ubbf8 \ubc0f \ucf54\ub529 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ud3b8\uc9d1 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub294 LLM\uc744 \uc801\uc751\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c \uc18c\uc2a4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ud3b8\uc9d1\uc5d0\uc11c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \uc720\ud615(\uc120\ud638\ub3c4, \uac10\ub3c5 \ub808\uc774\ube14 \ubc0f \ube44\uc6a9)\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc870\uc0ac\ub97c \uc9c4\ud589\ud558\uace0, \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \uc559\uc0c1\ube14 \uc808\ucc28\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \uc720\ud615\uc5d0\uc11c \uacf5\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc559\uc0c1\ube14 \uc808\ucc28\ub294 \uac1c\ubcc4 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc5d0\uc11c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ud55c \uc808\ucc28\ub294 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ud3b8\uc9d1 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc5d0 \uac15\ub825\ud558\uac8c \uc801\uc751\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubb38\ub9e5, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc751\ub2f5 \ubc0f \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ud3b8\uc9d1\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ud3b8\uc9d1 \ubc30\ud3ec \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec LLM\uc744 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubc30\ud3ec \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc791\uc131 \ub3c4\uc6b0\ubbf8 \ubc0f \ucf54\ub529 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7fd\uac8c \uc0dd\uc131\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ud3b8\uc9d1\uc758 _\uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7ec\uc6b4_ \ucd9c\ucc98\ub294 LLM\uc744 \uc801\uc751\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ubc14\ub78c\uc9c1\ud55c \uc18c\uc2a4\uac00 \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc120\ud638\ub3c4, \uac10\ub3c5 \ub808\uc774\ube14 \ubc0f \ube44\uc6a9\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \uc720\ud615\uc758 \ud1b5\uc77c\uc131\uc774 \ub098\ud0c0\ub098\uba70 \uc774\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubb38\ud5cc\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcc4\ub3c4\ub85c \uc5f0\uad6c\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ud3b8\uc9d1\uc5d0\uc11c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc870\uc0ac\ub97c \uc2dc\uc791\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac01 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \uc720\ud615\uc5d0\uc11c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc774 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\ud3ec \ubc0f \ubaa8\ub378 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ub2e4\ub978 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7f0 \ub2e4\uc74c \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \uc720\ud615\uc5d0\uc11c \uacf5\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \uc559\uc0c1\ube14 \uc808\ucc28\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Despite surface changes, functional semantics and task intents remain fundamentally stable. Building on this insight, we introduce MAGNET, a memory-driven adaptive agent framework with dual-level memory: stationary memory linking diverse visual features to stable functional semantics for robust action grounding and procedural memory capturing stable task intents across varying workflows.

Winner-take-all circuits and time-to-first-spike coding implicitly treat when a neuron fires as an expression of confidence. We apply this principle to ensembles of Tiny Recursive Models (TRM). By basing the ensemble prediction solely on the first to halt rather than averaging predictions, we achieve 97.2% puzzle accuracy on Sudoku-Extreme while using 10x less compute than test-time augmentation (the baseline achieves 86.1% single-pass, 97.3% with TTA). Inference speed is an implicit indication of confidence. But can this capability be manifested as a training-only cost? Evidently yes: by maintaining K = 4 parallel latent states during training but backpropping only through the lowest-loss \"winner,\" a single model achieves 96.9% +/- 0.6% puzzle accuracy with a single forward pass-matching TTA performance without any test-time augmentation. As in nature, this work was also resource constrained: all experimentation used a single RTX 5090. This necessitated efficiency and compelled our invention of a modified SwiGLU which made Muon viable. With Muon and K = 1 training, we exceed TRM baseline performance in 7k steps (40 min).

Compositional methods improve interpretability, but most rely on a single agent or hand-crafted pipeline and cannot decide when to collaborate across complementary agents or compete among overlapping ones. We introduce MATA (Multi-Agent hierarchical Trainable Automaton), a multi-agent system presented as a hierarchical finite-state automaton for visual reasoning whose top-level transitions are chosen by a trainable hyper agent. Each agent corresponds to a state in the hyper automaton, and runs a small rule-based sub-automaton for reliable micro-control. All agents read and write a shared memory, yielding transparent execution history. To supervise the hyper agent's transition policy, we build transition-trajectory trees and transform to memory-to-next-state pairs, forming the MATA-SFT-90K dataset for supervised finetuning (SFT). The finetuned LLM as the transition policy understands the query and the capacity of agents, and it can efficiently choose the optimal agent to solve the task. Across multiple visual reasoning benchmarks, MATA achieves the state-of-the-art results compared with monolithic and compositional baselines.

However, supervised DNN solvers require large-scale datasets, which limits their generalization in practical applications. Untrained neural networks (UNNs) address this issue by updating weights from measured electric fields and prior physical knowledge, but existing UNN solvers suffer from long inference time. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a contrast-source-based physics-driven neural network (CSPDNN), which predicts the induced current distribution to improve efficiency and incorporates an adaptive total variation loss for robust reconstruction under varying contrast and noise conditions. The improved imaging performance is validated through comprehensive numerical simulations and experimental data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub300\uc870\uc6d0 \uae30\ubc18 \ubb3c\ub9ac\ud559 \uad6c\ub3d9 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(CSPDNN)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \ube44\uc120\ud615 \ub9e4\ud551 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0, \ubcc0\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub300\uc870\uc640 \uc7a1\uc74c \uc870\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\uc778\ud55c \ubcf5\uc6d0\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ucd1d \ubcc0\ub3d9 \uc190\uc2e4\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uac10\ub3c5\ud615 DNN \uc194\ubc84\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\uc81c \uc751\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\uac00 \uc81c\ud55c\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ube44\ud6c8\ub828 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(UNN)\uc740 \uc804\uae30\uc7a5 \uce21\uc815\uacfc \uae30\uc874 \ubb3c\ub9ac \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub97c \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc720\ub3c4 \uc804\ub958 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \ub300\uc870\uc6d0 \uae30\ubc18 \ubb3c\ub9ac\ud559 \uad6c\ub3d9 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(CSPDNN)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uace0 \ubcc0\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub300\uc870 \ubc0f \uc7a1\uc74c \uc870\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\uc778\ud55c \ubcf5\uc6d0\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ucd1d \ubcc0\ub3d9 \uc190\uc2e4\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uac1c\uc120\ub41c \uc774\ubbf8\uc9d5 \uc131\ub2a5\uc740 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \uc218\uce58 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ubc0f \uc2e4\ud5d8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uac80\uc99d\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "CSPDNN\uc740 \uae30\uc874 UNN \uc194\ubc84\uc758 \uae34 \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uace0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uba70, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc870\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc \ub525 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(DNN)\uc740 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ube44\uc120\ud615 \ub9e4\ud551 \ub2a5\ub825 \ub355\ubd84\uc5d0 \uc5ed\uc0b0\ub780 \ubb38\uc81c(ISP)\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uac10\ub3c5\ud615 DNN \uc194\ubc84\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \uc694\uad6c\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\uc81c \uc751\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\uc5d0 \uc81c\ud55c\uc744 \uc8fc\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ube44\ud6c8\ub828 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(UNN)\uc740 \uce21\uc815\ub41c \uc804\uae30\uc7a5\uacfc \uc774\uc804\uc758 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub97c \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874 UNN \uc194\ubc84\ub294 \uae34 \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub300\uc870\uc6d0 \uae30\ubc18 \ubb3c\ub9ac\ud559 \uad6c\ub3d9 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(CSPDNN)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc720\ub3c4 \uc804\ub958 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \uc608\uce21\ud558\uc5ec \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0 \ubcc0\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub300\uc870 \ubc0f \uc7a1\uc74c \uc870\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\uc778\ud55c \ubcf5\uc6d0\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ucd1d \ubcc0\ub3d9 \uc190\uc2e4\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac1c\uc120\ub41c \uc774\ubbf8\uc9d5 \uc131\ub2a5\uc740 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \uc218\uce58 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ubc0f \uc2e4\ud5d8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uac80\uc99d\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, these assumptions often break down in practical environments with dynamic drifts. We propose the Global Verifier (GLOVE), a framework that introduces a new design dimension for LLM memory systems by establishing a relative notion of truth. Through active probing to detect inconsistencies between retrieved memories and fresh observations, GLOVE enables memory-environment realignment by verifying and updating memory without access to ground-truth supervision or strong reliance on model introspection.

We develop a theoretical framework to explain this phenomenon by showing that the empirical score function (the score function corresponding to the empirical distribution) is a weighted sum of the score functions of Gaussian distributions, in which the weights are sharp softmax functions. This structure causes individual training samples to dominate the score function, resulting in sampling collapse. In practice, approximating the empirical score function with a neural network can partially alleviate this issue and improve generalization. Our theoretical framework explains why: In training, the neural network learns a smoother approximation of the weighted sum, allowing the sampling process to be influenced by local manifolds rather than single points. Leveraging this insight, we propose two novel methods to further enhance generalization: (1) Noise Unconditioning enables each training sample to adaptively determine its score function weight to increase the effect of more training samples, thereby preventing single-point dominance and mitigating collapse. (2) Temperature Smoothing introduces an explicit parameter to control the smoothness. By increasing the temperature in the softmax weights, we naturally reduce the dominance of any single training sample and mitigate memorization. Experiments across multiple datasets validate our theoretical analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in improving generalization while maintaining high generation quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ud0c1\uc6d4\ud55c \uc0dd\uc131 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ud559\uc2b5 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \uc815\ud655\ud788 \ubcf5\uc81c\ud558\ub294 '\uae30\uc5b5' \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc774 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud558\ub294 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ud2c0\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uace0, \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ubd80\ubd84\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc644\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc0dd\uc131 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud568.", "method": "\uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ud2c0\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95, \uc989 Noise Unconditioning\uacfc Temperature Smoothing\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b4.", "result": "\uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud574 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \uc810\uc218 \ud568\uc218\uc758 \uadfc\uc0ac\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc774 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90c.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc774 \uc0dd\uc131 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uac80\uc99d.", "translated_summary": "\ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ub180\ub77c\uc6b4 \uc0dd\uc131 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc0dd\uc131 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc774 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \uc815\ud655\ud788 \ubcf5\uc81c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 '\uae30\uc5b5'\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \uc810\uc218 \ud568\uc218(\uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc5d0 \ud574\ub2f9\ud558\ub294 \uc810\uc218 \ud568\uc218)\uac00 \uac00\uc6b0\uc2dc\uc548 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc758 \uc810\uc218 \ud568\uc218\uc758 \uac00\uc911\ud569\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90c\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc774 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud558\ub294 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ud2c0\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uad6c\uc870\ub294 \uac1c\ubcc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc774 \uc810\uc218 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \uc9c0\ubc30\ud558\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4e4\uc5b4 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uc758 \ubd95\uad34\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\uc81c\ub85c \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc73c\ub85c \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \uc810\uc218 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \uadfc\uc0ac\ud558\uba74 \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ubd80\ubd84\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc644\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ud2c0\uc740 \uadf8 \uc774\uc720\ub97c \uc124\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: \ud559\uc2b5 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc740 \uac00\uc911\ud569\uc758 \ubd80\ub4dc\ub7ec\uc6b4 \uadfc\uc0ac\ub97c \ubc30\uc6b0\uac8c \ub418\uc5b4 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \uacfc\uc815\uc774 \ub2e8\uc77c \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8\uac00 \uc544\ub2cc \uc9c0\uc5ed \ub9e4\ub2c8\ud3f4\ub4dc\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubc1b\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \ub354\uc6b1 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: (1) Noise Unconditioning\uc740 \uac01 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc774 \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc810\uc218 \ud568\uc218\uc758 \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub97c \uacb0\uc815\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \ub354 \ub9ce\uc740 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc758 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0b4\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ub2e8\uc77c \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8 \uc9c0\ubc30\ub97c \ubc29\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \ubd95\uad34\ub97c \uc644\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

We introduce a curiosity driven knowledge retrieval framework that formalizes uncertainty during execution as a curiosity score. When this score exceeds a threshold, the system retrieves external information from documentation, code repositories, and historical trajectories. Retrieved content is organized into structured AppCards, which encode functional semantics, parameter conventions, interface mappings, and interaction patterns. During execution, an enhanced agent selectively integrates relevant AppCards into its reasoning process, thereby compensating for knowledge blind spots and improving planning reliability. Evaluation on the AndroidWorld benchmark shows consistent improvements across backbones, with an average gain of six percentage points and a new state of the art success rate of 88.8\\% when combined with GPT-5. Analysis indicates that AppCards are particularly effective for multi step and cross application tasks, while improvements depend on the backbone model. Case studies further confirm that AppCards reduce ambiguity, shorten exploration, and support stable execution trajectories.

Individual jobs carry heterogeneous contextual features, based on which the agent chooses a job and matches it with a server to maximize the departure rate. The service/departure rate is governed by a logistic model of the contextual feature with an unknown server-specific parameter. To evaluate the performance of a policy, we consider queue length regret, defined as the difference in queue length between the policy and the optimal policy. The main challenge in the analysis is that the lists of remaining job features in the queue may differ under our policy versus the optimal policy for a given time step, since they may process jobs in different orders. To address this, we propose the idea of policy-switching queues equipped with a sophisticated coupling argument. This leads to a novel queue length regret decomposition framework, allowing us to understand the short-term effect of choosing a suboptimal job-server pair and its long-term effect on queue state differences. We show that our algorithm, CQB-$\\varepsilon$, achieves a regret upper bound of $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/4})$. We also consider the setting of adversarially chosen contexts, for which our second algorithm, CQB-Opt, achieves a regret upper bound of $\\mathcal{O}(\\log^2 T)$.

This study investigates whether deploying smaller-scale language models can reduce energy consumption without compromising responsiveness and output quality in a multi-agent, real-world environments. We conduct a comparative analysis across language models of varying scales to quantify trade-offs between efficiency and performance.

Prior research has established that the difference between an input sample and its reconstructed version produced by an auxiliary model can serve as a useful proxy for uncertainty. However, directly comparing reconstructions with the original input is degraded by information loss and sensitivity to superficial details, which limits its effectiveness. In this work, we propose Difference Reconstruction Uncertainty Estimation (DRUE), a method that mitigates this limitation by reconstructing inputs from two intermediate layers and measuring the discrepancy between their outputs as the uncertainty score. To evaluate uncertainty estimation in practice, we follow the widely used out-of-distribution (OOD) detection paradigm, where in-distribution (ID) training data are compared against datasets with increasing domain shift. Using glaucoma detection as the ID task, we demonstrate that DRUE consistently achieves superior AUC and AUPR across multiple OOD datasets, highlighting its robustness and reliability under distribution shift. This work provides a principled and effective framework for enhancing model reliability in uncertain environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \ucd94\uc815\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c DRUE\ub77c\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc911\uac04 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\ub85c\ubd80\ud130\uc758 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uace0\uc704\ud5d8 \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ucd94\uc815\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc785\ub825 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \uc911\uac04 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uadf8 \ucd9c\ub825 \uac04\uc758 \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc810\uc218\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 DRUE \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uae00\ub85c\ucf54\ub9c8 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub97c ID \uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uc5ec \uc5ec\ub7ec OOD \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c DRUE\uac00 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c AUC \ubc0f AUPR\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud568\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc6d0\uce59\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub525 \ub7ec\ub2dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \ucd94\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc758\ub8cc \uc774\ubbf8\uc9d5\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uace0\uc704\ud5d8 \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uc804 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc785\ub825 \uc0d8\ud50c\uacfc \ubcf4\uc870 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131 \ubc84\uc804 \uac04\uc758 \ucc28\uc774\uac00 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\ub294 \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c \uc9c0\ud45c\uac00 \ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubc1d\ud614\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\uacfc \uc6d0\ub798 \uc785\ub825\uc744 \uc9c1\uc811 \ube44\uad50\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc190\uc2e4 \ubc0f \ud53c\uc0c1\uc801 \uc138\ubd80 \uc0ac\ud56d\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubbfc\uac10\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc81c\ud55c\ub418\uba70, \uadf8 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \uc911\uac04 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc785\ub825\uc744 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uadf8 \ucd9c\ub825 \uac04\uc758 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub97c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc810\uc218\ub85c \uce21\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uc644\ud654\ud558\ub294 Difference Reconstruction Uncertainty Estimation (DRUE) \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\uc81c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ucd94\uc815\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubd84\ud3ec \uc678(OOD) \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \ub530\ub974\uba70, \uc5ec\uae30\uc5d0\uc120 \ubc30\uacbd \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec \uc778\uc2dd\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130(ID) \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae00\ub85c\ucf54\ub9c8 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub97c ID \uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, DRUE\uac00 \uc5ec\ub7ec OOD \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c AUC \ubc0f AUPR\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud568\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ubd84\ud3ec \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uadf8 \uac15\uac74\uc131\uacfc \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc6d0\uce59\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

While concurrent tool execution can enhance discovery speed, current agents demonstrate a 34.9\\% redundant invocation rate, which negates parallelism benefits. We propose \\textbf{FuseSearch}, reformulating parallel code localization as a \\textbf{joint quality-efficiency optimization} task. Through defining \\textbf{tool efficiency} -- the ratio of unique information gain to invocation count -- we utilize a two-phase SFT and RL training approach for learning adaptive parallel strategies. Different from fixed-breadth approaches, FuseSearch dynamically modulates search breadth according to task context, evolving from exploration phases to refinement stages. Evaluated on SWE-bench Verified, FuseSearch-4B achieves SOTA-level performance (84.7\\% file-level and 56.4\\% function-level $F_1$ scores) with 93.6\\% speedup, utilizing 67.7\\% fewer turns and 68.9\\% fewer tokens.

In practice, demonstrations are frequently sparse, suboptimal, or misaligned, which can degrade performance when these demonstrations are integrated into RL. We propose Adaptive Policy Composition (APC), a hierarchical model that adaptively composes multiple data-driven Normalizing Flow (NF) priors. Instead of enforcing strict adherence to the priors, APC estimates each prior's applicability to the target task while leveraging them for exploration. Moreover, APC either refines useful priors, or sidesteps misaligned ones when necessary to optimize downstream reward. Across diverse benchmarks, APC accelerates learning when demonstrations are aligned, remains robust under severe misalignment, and leverages suboptimal demonstrations to bootstrap exploration while avoiding performance degradation caused by overly strict adherence to suboptimal demonstrations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\uc5f0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc815\ucc45 \uad6c\uc131(APC) \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\uc5f0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uba74 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc18d\ub3c4\ub97c \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc2dc\uc5f0\uc774 \ucd5c\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc791\uc5c5\uacfc \uc644\uc804\ud788 \uc77c\uce58\ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \uac00\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc815\ucc45 \uad6c\uc131(APC)\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \ud750\ub984(NF) \uc0ac\uc804 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "APC\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uae30\uc900\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\uc5f0\uc774 \uc77c\uce58\ud560 \ub54c \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud558\uace0, \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba70, \ud558\uc704 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uc2dc\uc5f0\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud574 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \ubd80\ud2b8\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub7a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "APC\ub294 \ud558\uc704 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uc2dc\uc5f0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \ub54c \uc131\ub2a5 \uc800\ud558\ub97c \ud53c\ud558\uba70, \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ud55c \uc0ac\uc804\uc744 \ud53c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc5d0 \uc2dc\uc5f0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uba74 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc2dc\uc5f0\uc774 \ucd5c\uc801\uc774\uba70 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc791\uc5c5\uacfc \uc644\uc804\ud788 \uc77c\uce58\ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \uac00\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc2e4\uc81c\ub85c \uc2dc\uc5f0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub294 \uc885\uc885 \ud76c\uc18c\ud558\uace0, \ube44\ucd5c\uc801\uc774\uba70 \ub610\ub294 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc2dc\uc5f0\uc744 RL\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud560 \ub54c \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc800\ud558\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \ud750\ub984(Normalizing Flow, NF) \uc0ac\uc804 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ubaa8\ub378\uc778 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc815\ucc45 \uad6c\uc131(Adaptive Policy Composition, APC)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Existing efforts to characterise agentic design patterns often lack a rigorous systems-theoretic foundation, resulting in high-level or convenience-based taxonomies that are difficult to implement. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a principled methodology for engineering robust AI agents. We propose two primary contributions: first, a novel system-theoretic framework that deconstructs an agentic AI system into five core, interacting functional subsystems: Reasoning & World Model, Perception & Grounding, Action Execution, Learning & Adaptation, and Inter-Agent Communication. Second, derived from this architecture and directly mapped to a comprehensive taxonomy of agentic challenges, we present a collection of 12 agentic design patterns. These patterns - categorised as Foundational, Cognitive & Decisional, Execution & Interaction, and Adaptive & Learning - offer reusable, structural solutions to recurring problems in agent design. The utility of the framework is demonstrated by a case study on the ReAct framework, showing how the proposed patterns can rectify systemic architectural deficiencies. This work provides a foundational language and a structured methodology to standardise agentic design communication among researchers and engineers, leading to more modular, understandable, and reliable autonomous systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uac15\ub825\ud55c AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778

Motivated by this, we propose Multi-head Explicit Attention (MEA), a simple yet effective attention variant that explicitly models cross-head interaction. MEA consists of two key components: a Head-level Linear Composition (HLC) module that separately applies learnable linear combinations to the key and value vectors across heads, thereby enabling rich inter-head communication; and a head-level Group Normalization layer that aligns the statistical properties of the recombined heads. MEA shows strong robustness in pretraining, which allows the use of larger learning rates that lead to faster convergence, ultimately resulting in lower validation loss and improved performance across a range of tasks. Furthermore, we explore the parameter efficiency of MEA by reducing the number of attention heads and leveraging HLC to reconstruct them using low-rank \"virtual heads\". This enables a practical key-value cache compression strategy that reduces KV-cache memory usage by 50% with negligible performance loss on knowledge-intensive and scientific reasoning tasks, and only a 3.59% accuracy drop for Olympiad-level mathematical benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud5e4\ub4dc \uba85\uc2dc\uc801 \uc8fc\uc758(MEA)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc8fc\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubcc0\uc555\uae30 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \uae30\ubc18 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \ud5e4\ub4dc \uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc774 \uc8fc\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc5d0 \ub3d9\uae30\ub97c \ubd80\uc5ec\ubc1b\uc558\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "MEA\ub294 \ub9ac\ub2c8\uc5b4 \uc870\ud569 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uacfc \ud5e4\ub4dc \uc218\uc900 \uadf8\ub8f9 \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uc5ec \uad50\ucc28 \ud5e4\ub4dc \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "MEA\ub294 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uacac\uace0\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5b4 \ub354 \ud070 \ud559\uc2b5\ub960\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ub354 \ube60\ub978 \uc218\ub834\uacfc \ub0ae\uc740 \uac80\uc99d \uc190\uc2e4\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubc1c\ud718\ud558\uba70, KV \uce90\uc2dc \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 50% \uc904\uc774\ub294 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubcc0\uc555\uae30 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uadfc \uc5f0\uad6c\ub4e4\uc740 \ud5e4\ub4dc \uac04 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc774 \uc8fc\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uc5d0 \ub3d9\uae30\ub97c \ubd80\uc5ec\ubc1b\uc544, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud5e4\ub4dc \uac04 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \uac04\ub2e8\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc8fc\uc758 \ubcc0\ud615\uc778 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud5e4\ub4dc \uba85\uc2dc\uc801 \uc8fc\uc758(MEA)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

We propose CASTER (Context-Aware Strategy for Task Efficient Routing), a lightweight router for dynamic model selection in graph-based MAS. CASTER employs a Dual-Signal Router that combines semantic embeddings with structural meta-features to estimate task difficulty. During training, the router self-optimizes through a Cold Start to Iterative Evolution paradigm, learning from its own routing failures via on-policy negative feedback. Experiments using LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation across Software Engineering, Data Analysis, Scientific Discovery, and Cybersecurity demonstrate that CASTER reduces inference cost by up to 72.4% compared to strong-model baselines while matching their success rates, and consistently outperforms both heuristic routing and FrugalGPT across all domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uae30\ubc18 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ub3d9\uc801 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc120\ud0dd\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub77c\uc6b0\ud130\uc778 CASTER\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

In this work, we tackle this challenge by utilizing suboptimal yet conservative policies (e.g., obtained from offline data or simulators) as priors. Our approach, SOOPER, uses probabilistic dynamics models to optimistically explore, yet pessimistically fall back to the conservative policy prior if needed. We prove that SOOPER guarantees safety throughout learning, and establish convergence to an optimal policy by bounding its cumulative regret. Extensive experiments on key safe RL benchmarks and real-world hardware demonstrate that SOOPER is scalable, outperforms the state-of-the-art and validate our theoretical guarantees in practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub41c \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \ub118\uc5b4 \uc628\ub77c\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uace0 \uc801\uc751\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc548\uc804\ud55c \ud0d0\uc0c9.", "method": "SOOPER\ub77c\ub294 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \ube44\uad00\uc801 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc6b0\uc120\uc2dc\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ud655\ub960\ub860\uc801 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub099\uad00\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, SOOPER\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\uace0 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "SOOPER\ub294 \ud559\uc2b5 \uacfc\uc815 \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uba70 \ucd5c\uc801 \uc815\ucc45\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \uc218\ub834\uc744 \uc124\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc548\uc804\ud55c \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc740 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub41c(\uc608: \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ub41c) \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \ub118\uc5b4 \uc628\ub77c\uc778\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uace0 \uc801\uc751\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud575\uc2ec \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ub610\ub294 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5bb\uc740 \ube44\ucd5c\uc801\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc \ubcf4\uc218\uc801\uc778 \uc815\ucc45(\uc608: \uc0ac\uc804 \uc815\ubcf4)\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc811\uadfc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc778 SOOPER\ub294 \ud655\ub960 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub099\uad00\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\ub418, \ud544\uc694\uc2dc \ubcf4\uc218\uc801\uc778 \uc815\ucc45 \uc0ac\uc804\uc73c\ub85c \ube44\uad00\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub418\ub3cc\uc544\uac11\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 SOOPER\uac00 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uace0, \ub204\uc801 \ud6c4\ud68c\ub97c \uacbd\uacc4\ud558\uc5ec \ucd5c\uc801 \uc815\ucc45\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \uc218\ub834\uc744 \uc124\uc815\ud568\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc8fc\uc694 \uc548\uc804 RL \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc640 \uc2e4\uc81c \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 SOOPER\ub294 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uba70, \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uc2e4\uc81c\ub85c \uac80\uc99d\ud568\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Recent advances in group-based policy optimization methods have shown promise in enabling stable advantage estimation without reliance on process-level annotations. However, these methods rely on advantage gaps induced by high-quality samples within the same batch, which makes the training process fragile and inefficient when intra-group advantages collapse under challenging tasks. To address these problems, we propose a reinforcement learning mechanism named \\emph{\\textbf{R^3}} that along three directions: (1) a \\emph{cross-context \\underline{\\textbf{R}}eplay} strategy that maintains the intra-group advantage by recalling valuable examples from historical trajectories of the same query, (2) an \\emph{in-context self-\\underline{\\textbf{R}}eflection} mechanism enabling models to refine outputs by leveraging past failures, and (3) a \\emph{structural entropy \\underline{\\textbf{R}}anking reward}, which assigns relative rewards to truncated or failed samples by ranking responses based on token-level entropy patterns, capturing both local exploration and global stability. We implement our method on Deepseek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and train it on the DeepscaleR-40k in the math domain. Experiments demonstrate our method achieves SoTA performance on several math benchmarks, representing significant improvements and fewer reasoning tokens over the base models.

Commonly used exploration strategies in reinforcement learning are largely undirected with sharp degradation as action dimensionality grows. Many existing methods resort to dimensionality reduction, which constrains policy expressiveness and forfeits system flexibility. We introduce Q-guided Flow Exploration (Qflex), a scalable reinforcement learning method that conducts exploration directly in the native high-dimensional action space. During training, Qflex traverses actions from a learnable source distribution along a probability flow induced by the learned value function, aligning exploration with task-relevant gradients rather than isotropic noise. Our proposed method substantially outperforms representative online reinforcement learning baselines across diverse high-dimensional continuous-control benchmarks.

Conventional model compression techniques for complexity reduction, such as structured pruning based on norm-based metrics to estimate the relative importance of distinct parameter groups, often fail to capture functional significance. This paper introduces a component-aware pruning framework that utilizes gradient information to compute three distinct importance metrics during training: Gradient Accumulation, Fisher Information, and Bayesian Uncertainty. Experimental results with an autoencoder and a TD-MPC agent demonstrate that the proposed framework reveals critical structural dependencies and dynamic shifts in importance that static heuristics often miss, supporting more informed compression decisions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \ucee8\ud2b8\ub864\ub7ec\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c \uc778\uc2dd \ud504\ub8e8\ub2dd \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc911\uc5d0 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc911\uc694\uc131 \uc9c0\ud45c\ub97c \uacc4\uc0b0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubaa8\ub180\ub9ac\uc2dd \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc911 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub85c\uc758 \uc804\ud658\uc740 \ub192\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ub3c4 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804\uc744 \uc81c\uae30\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud6c8\ub828 \uc911\uc5d0 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubcc4\ub3c4\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131 \uc9c0\ud45c\ub97c \uacc4\uc0b0\ud558\ub294 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c \uc778\uc2dd \ud504\ub8e8\ub2dd \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \ucd95\uc801, \ud53c\uc154 \uc815\ubcf4, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \ubca0\uc774esian \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131.", "result": "\uc790\ub3d9 \uc778\ucf54\ub354\uc640 TD-MPC \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 \uc815\uc801 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1\uc774 \uc885\uc885 \ub193\uce58\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uacfc \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc758 \ub3d9\uc801 \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0c4\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc815\ubcf4\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uc555\ucd95 \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubaa8\ub180\ub9ac\uc2dd\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc911 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c \uc2e0\uacbd \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub85c\uc758 \uc804\ud658\uc740 \ud6c4\uc790\uc758 \ub192\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804\uc744 \uc81c\uae30\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc0c1\ub300\uc801\uc778 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \ucd94\uc815\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubaa8\ud615 \uc555\ucd95 \uae30\uc220(\uc608: \ub178\ub984 \uae30\ubc18 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc5d0 \uadfc\uac70\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ud504\ub8e8\ub2dd)\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uae30\ub2a5\uc801 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc911 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubcc4\ub3c4\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131 \uc9c0\ud45c(\uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \ucd95\uc801, \ud53c\uc154 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubc0f \ubca0\uc774\uc988 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131)\ub97c \uacc4\uc0b0\ud558\ub294 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c \uc778\uc2dd \ud504\ub8e8\ub2dd \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc790\ub3d9 \uc778\ucf54\ub354\uc640 TD-MPC \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 \uc815\uc801 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1\uc774 \uc885\uc885 \ub193\uce58\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uacfc \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc758 \ub3d9\uc801 \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b4\uc5b4 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc815\ubcf4\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uc555\ucd95 \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

A promising direction, grounded in human development, investigates agents that learn by setting and pursuing their own goals. The core challenge lies in how to effectively generate, select, and learn from such goals. Our focus is on broad distributions of downstream tasks where solving every task zero-shot is infeasible. Such settings naturally arise when the target tasks lie outside of the pre-training distribution or when their identities are unknown to the agent. In this work, we (i) optimize for efficient multi-episode exploration and adaptation within a meta-learning framework, and (ii) guide the training curriculum with evolving estimates of the agent's post-adaptation performance. We present ULEE, an unsupervised meta-learning method that combines an in-context learner with an adversarial goal-generation strategy that maintains training at the frontier of the agent's capabilities. On XLand-MiniGrid benchmarks, ULEE pre-training yields improved exploration and adaptation abilities that generalize to novel objectives, environment dynamics, and map structures.

Hu", "Jane Pan", "Ayush Rajesh Jhaveri", "Nicholas Lourie", "Kyunghyun Cho"], "title": "Neural Neural Scaling Laws", "comment": null, "summary": "Neural scaling laws predict how language model performance improves with increased compute. While aggregate metrics like validation loss can follow smooth power-law curves, individual downstream tasks exhibit diverse scaling behaviors: some improve monotonically, others plateau, and some even degrade with scale. We argue that predicting downstream performance from validation perplexity suffers from two limitations: averaging token-level losses obscures signal, and no simple parametric family can capture the full spectrum of scaling behaviors. To address this, we propose Neural Neural Scaling Laws (NeuNeu), a neural network that frames scaling law prediction as time-series extrapolation. NeuNeu combines temporal context from observed accuracy trajectories with token-level validation losses, learning to predict future performance without assuming any bottleneck or functional form. Trained entirely on open-source model checkpoints from HuggingFace, NeuNeu achieves 2.04% mean absolute error in predicting model accuracy on 66 downstream tasks -- a 38% reduction compared to logistic scaling laws (3.29% MAE).
