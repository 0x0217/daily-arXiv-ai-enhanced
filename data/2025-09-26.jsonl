To Appear at ECAI 2025", "summary": "Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is a growing research area which\ngained significant traction in recent years, extending Deep RL applications to\na much wider range of problems. A particularly challenging class of problems in\nthis domain is Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HeMARL), where\nagents with different sensors, resources, or capabilities must cooperate based\non local information. The large number of real-world situations involving\nheterogeneous agents makes it an attractive research area, yet underexplored,\nas most MARL research focuses on homogeneous agents (e.g., a swarm of identical\nrobots). In MARL and single-agent RL, standardized environments such as ALE and\nSMAC have allowed to establish recognized benchmarks to measure progress.\nHowever, there is a clear lack of such standardized testbed for cooperative\nHeMARL. As a result, new research in this field often uses simple environments,\nwhere most algorithms perform near optimally, or uses weakly heterogeneous MARL\nenvironments."}

This limitation leads to inefficient task\nrouting, particularly in dynamic environments where agent capabilities\ncontinuously evolve. We introduce Knowledge Base-Aware (KBA) Orchestration, a\nnovel approach that augments static descriptions with dynamic,\nprivacy-preserving relevance signals derived from each agent's internal\nknowledge base (KB). In the proposed framework, when static descriptions are\ninsufficient for a clear routing decision, the orchestrator prompts the\nsubagents in parallel. Each agent then assesses the task's relevance against\nits private KB, returning a lightweight ACK signal without exposing the\nunderlying data. These collected signals populate a shared semantic cache,\nproviding dynamic indicators of agent suitability for future queries. By\ncombining this novel mechanism with static descriptions, our method achieves\nmore accurate and adaptive task routing preserving agent autonomy and data\nconfidentiality. Benchmarks show that our KBA Orchestration significantly\noutperforms static description-driven methods in routing precision and overall\nsystem efficiency, making it suitable for large-scale systems that require\nhigher accuracy than standard description-driven routing."}

While\nseeking answers to know more on those security concerns, users are mostly left\nwith their own discretion while going through various sources, such as online\nblogs and technical manuals, which may render higher complexity to regular\nusers trying to extract the necessary information. This requirement does not go\nalong with the common mindsets of smart home users and hence threatens the\nsecurity of smart homes furthermore. In this paper, we aim to identify and\naddress the major user-level security concerns in smart homes. Specifically, we\ndevelop a novel dataset of Q&A from public forums, capturing practical security\nchallenges faced by smart home users. We extract major security concerns in\nsmart homes from our dataset by leveraging the Latent Dirichlet Allocation\n(LDA). We fine-tune relatively \"smaller\" transformer models, such as T5 and\nFlan-T5, on this dataset to build a QA system tailored for smart home security.\nUnlike larger models like GPT and Gemini, which are powerful but often resource\nhungry and require data sharing, smaller models are more feasible for\ndeployment in resource-constrained or privacy-sensitive environments like smart\nhomes. The dataset is manually curated and supplemented with synthetic data to\nexplore its potential impact on model performance.

The model performs discrete wavelet transformations on historical\ntransaction data and macroeconomic indicators to generate localized economic\nshock signals. The transformed features are then fed into a deep fuzzy rule\nlibrary which is based on Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy rules with adaptive Gaussian\nmembership functions.

Current\nprompt engineering and multi-agent approaches typically optimize isolated\ninferences, neglecting the accumulation of reusable clinical experience. To\naddress this, this study proposes a novel Multi-Agent Clinical Diagnosis (MACD)\nframework, which allows LLMs to self-learn clinical knowledge via a multi-agent\npipeline that summarizes, refines, and applies diagnostic insights.

We further extend it to a\nMACD-human collaborative workflow, where multiple LLM-based diagnostician\nagents engage in iterative consultations, supported by an evaluator agent and\nhuman oversight for cases where agreement is not reached. Evaluated on 4,390\nreal-world patient cases across seven diseases using diverse open-source LLMs\n(Llama-3.1 8B/70B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama 70B), MACD significantly improves\nprimary diagnostic accuracy, outperforming established clinical guidelines with\ngains up to 22.3% (MACD).

Many public estimates are inconsistent and overstate\nenergy use, because they extrapolate from limited benchmarks and fail to\nreflect efficiency gains achievable at scale. In this perspective, we introduce\na bottom-up methodology to estimate the per-query energy of large-scale LLM\nsystems based on token throughput. For models running on an H100 node under\nrealistic workloads, GPU utilization and PUE constraints, we estimate a median\nenergy per query of 0.34 Wh (IQR: 0.18-0.67) for frontier-scale models (>200\nbillion parameters). These results are consistent with measurements using\nproduction-scale configurations and show that non-production estimates and\nassumptions can overstate energy use by 4-20x. Extending to test-time scaling\nscenarios with 15x more tokens per typical query, the median energy rises 13x\nto 4.32 Wh, indicating that targeting efficiency in this regime will deliver\nthe largest fleet-wide savings. We quantify achievable efficiency gains at the\nmodel, serving platform, and hardware levels, finding individual median\nreductions of 1.5-3.5x in energy per query, while combined advances can\nplausibly deliver 8-20x reductions. To illustrate the system-level impact, we\nestimate the baseline daily energy use of a deployment serving 1 billion\nqueries to be 0.8 GWh/day.

While attention mechanisms offer an implicit way to\nreduce the input to the elements that affect decisions, existing attention\nmechanisms for capturing agent interactions are quadratic, and generally\ncomputationally expensive. We propose RDAR, a strategy to learn per-agent\nrelevance -- how much each agent influences the behavior of the controlled\nvehicle -- by identifying which agents can be excluded from the input to a\npre-trained behavior model. We formulate the masking procedure as a Markov\nDecision Process where the action consists of a binary mask indicating agent\nselection. We evaluate RDAR on a large-scale driving dataset, and demonstrate\nits ability to learn an accurate numerical measure of relevance by achieving\ncomparable driving performance, in terms of overall progress, safety and\nperformance, while processing significantly fewer agents compared to a state of\nthe art behavior model."}

While foundation models possess strong semantic\npriors, their capabilities as zero-shot exploration agents in classic RL\nbenchmarks are not well understood. We benchmark LLMs and VLMs on multi-armed\nbandits, Gridworlds, and sparse-reward Atari to test zero-shot exploration. Our\ninvestigation reveals a key limitation: while VLMs can infer high-level\nobjectives from visual input, they consistently fail at precise low-level\ncontrol: the \"knowing-doing gap\". To analyze a potential bridge for this gap,\nwe investigate a simple on-policy hybrid framework in a controlled, best-case\nscenario. Our results in this idealized setting show that VLM guidance can\nsignificantly improve early-stage sample efficiency, providing a clear analysis\nof the potential and constraints of using foundation models to guide\nexploration rather than for end-to-end control."}

While Large Language\nModels (LLMs) have the potential to automate and scale Security Operations\nCenter (SOC) operations, existing evaluations do not fully assess the scenarios\nmost relevant to real-world defenders. This lack of informed evaluation impacts\nboth AI developers and those applying LLMs to SOC automation. Without clear\ninsight into LLM performance in real-world security scenarios, developers lack\na north star for development, and users cannot reliably select the most\neffective models. Meanwhile, malicious actors are using AI to scale cyber\nattacks, highlighting the need for open source benchmarks to drive adoption and\ncommunity-driven improvement among defenders and model developers. To address\nthis, we introduce CyberSOCEval, a new suite of open source benchmarks within\nCyberSecEval 4. CyberSOCEval includes benchmarks tailored to evaluate LLMs in\ntwo tasks: Malware Analysis and Threat Intelligence Reasoning--core defensive\ndomains with inadequate coverage in current benchmarks. Our evaluations show\nthat larger, more modern LLMs tend to perform better, confirming the training\nscaling laws paradigm. We also find that reasoning models leveraging test time\nscaling do not achieve the same boost as in coding and math, suggesting these\nmodels have not been trained to reason about cybersecurity analysis, and\npointing to a key opportunity for improvement. Finally, current LLMs are far\nfrom saturating our evaluations, showing that CyberSOCEval presents a\nsignificant challenge for AI developers to improve cyber defense capabilities."}

Attack trees are\nwidely used to systematically represent potential attack vectors, but\ngenerating comprehensive test cases from these trees remains a labor-intensive,\nerror-prone task that has seen limited automation in the context of testing\nvehicular systems. This paper introduces STAF (Security Test Automation\nFramework), a novel approach to automating security test case generation.\nLeveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and a four-step self-corrective\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, STAF automates the generation\nof executable security test cases from attack trees, providing an end-to-end\nsolution that encompasses the entire attack surface. We particularly show the\nelements and processes needed to provide an LLM to actually produce sensible\nand executable automotive security test suites, along with the integration with\nan automated testing framework. We further compare our tailored approach with\ngeneral purpose (vanilla) LLMs and the performance of different LLMs (namely\nGPT-4.1 and DeepSeek) using our approach. We also demonstrate the method of our\noperation step-by-step in a concrete case study. Our results show significant\nimprovements in efficiency, accuracy, scalability, and easy integration in any\nworkflow, marking a substantial advancement in automating automotive security\ntesting methodologies.

Weight-only PTQ is crucial for reducing the memory footprint\nand latency of LLM inference, especially in memory-bound, small-batch inference\nscenarios, such as personalized inference on edge devices. Despite its\nimportance, irregular weight distributions with heavy-tailed outliers in LLMs\ncomplicate quantization, recently motivating rotation-based methods that\ntransform weights into near-Gaussian distributions, which are more regular with\nfewer outliers, thereby reducing quantization error. In this work, we first\nderive the information-theoretically optimal bit allocation for Gaussianized\nweights under given bit budgets, revealing that fine-grained fractional-bit\nquantizers approaching the Gaussian distortion-rate bound are essential to\nachieve near-optimal quantization performance. To bridge this theoretical\ninsight and practical implementation, we introduce Q-Palette, a versatile\ncollection of fractional-bit quantizers that range from trellis-coded\nquantizers offering near-optimal distortion to simpler vector and scalar\nquantizers optimized for faster inference, all efficiently implemented with\noptimized CUDA kernels across various bitwidths. Furthermore, leveraging\nQ-Palette as a foundational component, we propose a novel mixed-scheme\nquantization framework, jointly optimizing quantizer choices and layer fusion\ndecisions given resource constraints.

Oligopeptides have emerged as promising candidates\nin antimicrobial research due to their structural simplicity, high\nbioavailability, and low susceptibility to resistance. Despite their potential,\ncomputational models specifically designed to predict associations between\noligopeptides and infectious diseases remain scarce. This study introduces a\nprompt-guided graph-based contrastive learning framework (PGCLODA) to uncover\npotential associations. A tripartite graph is constructed with oligopeptides,\nmicrobes, and diseases as nodes, incorporating both structural and semantic\ninformation. To preserve critical regions during contrastive learning, a\nprompt-guided graph augmentation strategy is employed to generate meaningful\npaired views. A dual encoder architecture, integrating Graph Convolutional\nNetwork (GCN) and Transformer, is used to jointly capture local and global\nfeatures. The fused embeddings are subsequently input into a multilayer\nperceptron (MLP) classifier for final prediction. Experimental results on a\nbenchmark dataset indicate that PGCLODA consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art models in AUROC, AUPRC, and accuracy. Ablation and\nhyperparameter studies confirm the contribution of each module. Case studies\nfurther validate the generalization ability of PGCLODA and its potential to\nuncover novel, biologically relevant associations. These findings offer\nvaluable insights for mechanism-driven discovery and oligopeptide-based drug\ndevelopment.
