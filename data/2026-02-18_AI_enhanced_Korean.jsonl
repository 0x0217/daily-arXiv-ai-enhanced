The development process of PSCs is precise and complex, involving a series of closed-loop workflows such as literature retrieval, data integration, experimental design, and synthesis. However, existing AI perovskite approaches focus predominantly on discrete models, including material design, process optimization,and property prediction. These models fail to propagate physical constraints across the workflow, hindering end-to-end optimization. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent system for perovskite material discovery, named PeroMAS. We first encapsulated a series of perovskite-specific tools into Model Context Protocols (MCPs). By planning and invoking these tools, PeroMAS can design perovskite materials under multi-objective constraints, covering the entire process from literature retrieval and data extraction to property prediction and mechanism analysis. Furthermore, we construct an evaluation benchmark by perovskite human experts to assess this multi-agent system. Results demonstrate that, compared to single Large Language Model (LLM) or traditional search strategies, our system significantly enhances discovery efficiency. It successfully identified candidate materials satisfying multi-objective constraints. Notably, we verify PeroMAS's effectiveness in the physical world through real synthesis experiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud398\ub85c\ube0c\uc2a4\uce74\uc774\ud2b8 \ud0dc\uc591\uc804\uc9c0\uc758 \ubb3c\uc9c8 \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc778 PeroMAS\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \uadf8 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud398\ub85c\ube0c\uc2a4\uce74\uc774\ud2b8 \ud0dc\uc591\uc804\uc9c0(PSC)\ub294 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uad11\uc804\uc790 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \ube44\uc6a9 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc73c\ub85c \uc8fc\ubaa9 \ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\ub098, \uae30\uc874\uc758 AI \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uc8fc\ub85c \uac1c\ubcc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc804\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc800\ud574\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc81c\uc57d \uc870\uac74 \ud558\uc5d0 \ud398\ub85c\ube0c\uc2a4\uce74\uc774\ud2b8 \ubb3c\uc9c8\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 Model Context Protocols(MCPs)\uc5d0 \ud398\ub85c\ube0c\uc2a4\uce74\uc774\ud2b8 \ud2b9\uc815 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub4e4\uc744 \ucea1\uc290\ud654\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \uacc4\ud68d\ud558\uace0 \ud638\ucd9c\ud558\ub294 PeroMAS\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "PeroMAS\ub294 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub2e8\uc77c \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc774\ub098 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uac80\uc0c9 \uc804\ub7b5\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ubc1c\uacac \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0, \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc81c\uc57d \uc870\uac74\uc744 \ub9cc\uc871\ud558\ub294 \ud6c4\ubcf4 \ubb3c\uc9c8\uc744 \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud30c\uc545\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc2e4\uc81c \ud569\uc131 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 PeroMAS\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc138\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc720\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud398\ub85c\ube0c\uc2a4\uce74\uc774\ud2b8 \ud0dc\uc591\uc804\uc9c0(PSC)\ub294 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uad11\uc804\uc790 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \ube44\uc6a9 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc73c\ub85c \uc798 \uc54c\ub824\uc838 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc81c3\uc138\ub300 \ud0dc\uc591\uc804\uc9c0 \ud601\uba85\uc758 \uc120\uad6c\uc790\ub85c \uc5ec\uaca8\uc9c4\ub2e4.

Accepted to the conference Human Computer Interaction International", "summary": "Large Language Models are expanding beyond being a tool humans use and into independent agents that can observe an environment, reason about solutions to problems, make changes that impact those environments, and understand how their actions impacted their environment. One of the most common applications of these LLM Agents is in computer programming, where agents can successfully work alongside humans to generate code while controlling programming environments or networking systems. However, with the increasing ability and complexity of these agents comes dangers about the potential for their misuse. A concerning application of LLM agents is in the domain cybersecurity, where they have the potential to greatly expand the threat imposed by attacks such as social engineering. This is due to the fact that LLM Agents can work autonomously and perform many tasks that would normally require time and effort from skilled human programmers. While this threat is concerning, little attention has been given to assessments of the capabilities of LLM coding agents in generating code for social engineering attacks. In this work we compare different LLMs in their ability and willingness to produce potentially dangerous code bases that could be misused by cyberattackers. The result is a dataset of 200 website code bases and logs from 40 different LLM coding agents.

This creates a gap between what agents can do and should do. This gap widens as agents engage in multi-turn interactions and employ diverse tools, introducing new risks overlooked by existing benchmarks. To systematically scale safety testing into multi-turn, tool-realistic settings, we propose a principled taxonomy that transforms single-turn harmful tasks into multi-turn attack sequences. Using this taxonomy, we construct MT-AgentRisk (Multi-Turn Agent Risk Benchmark), the first benchmark to evaluate multi-turn tool-using agent safety. Our experiments reveal substantial safety degradation: the Attack Success Rate (ASR) increases by 16% on average across open and closed models in multi-turn settings. To close this gap, we propose ToolShield, a training-free, tool-agnostic, self-exploration defense: when encountering a new tool, the agent autonomously generates test cases, executes them to observe downstream effects, and distills safety experiences for deployment. Experiments show that ToolShield effectively reduces ASR by 30% on average in multi-turn interactions.

Inspired by how biological systems adapt, we introduce MASFly, a novel multi-agent framework enabling dynamic adaptation at test time. To adapt system generation, MASFly employs a retrieval-augmented SOP instantiation mechanism that leverages a self-constructed repository of successful collaboration patterns, enabling the LLM to assemble customized MASs for new queries. For adaptive execution, MASFly incorporates an experience-guided supervision mechanism, where a dedicated Watcher agent monitors system behaviors with reference to a personalized experience pool and provides real-time interventions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MASFly achieves state-of-the-art performance, most notably a 61.7% success rate on the TravelPlanner benchmark, while exhibiting strong task adaptability and robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "MASFly\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc73c\ub85c, \ub3d9\uc801 \uc801\uc751\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\ub4e4\uc774 \uc218\ub3d9 \uc124\uacc4\ub098 \uc77c\ub960\uc801\uc778 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc5b4 \ubc30\ud3ec \ud6c4 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc801\uc751\uc131\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "MASFly\ub294 \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc778 \ud611\uc5c5 \ud328\ud134\uc758 \uc790\uac00 \uad6c\ucd95 \uc800\uc7a5\uc18c\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec LLM\uc774 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ucffc\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub9de\ucda4\ud615 MAS\ub97c \uc870\ub9bd\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uac80\uc0c9 \ubcf4\uac15 SOP \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4\ud654 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ucc44\ud0dd\ud558\uace0, \uacbd\ud5d8 \uae30\ubc18 \uac10\ub3c5 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 Watcher \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c \uacbd\ud5d8 \ud480\uc744 \ucc38\uace0\ud558\uc5ec \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\ud558\uace0 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \uac1c\uc785\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "MASFly\ub294 TravelPlanner \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c 61.7%\uc758 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5 \uc801\uc751\uc131\uacfc \uacac\uace0\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "MASFly\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc801\uc751\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5 \ud574\uacb0\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(MAS)\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc73c\ub85c \ubd80\uc0c1\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub4e4\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uc218\ub3d9 \uc124\uacc4 \ub610\ub294 '\ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uac8c \ub9de\ub294' \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uba70 \ubc30\ud3ec \ud6c4 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc801\uc751\uc131\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc801\uc751 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc544, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc \ub3d9\uc801 \uc801\uc751\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 MASFly\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc801\uc751\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 MASFly\ub294 \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc778 \ud611\uc5c5 \ud328\ud134\uc758 \uc790\uac00 \uad6c\ucd95 \ub9ac\ud3ec\uc9c0\ud1a0\ub9ac\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac80\uc0c9 \ubcf4\uac15 SOP \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4\ud654 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec LLM\uc774 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ucffc\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub9de\ucda4\ud615 MAS\ub97c \uc870\ub9bd\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc801\uc751 \uc2e4\ud589\uc744 \uc704\ud574, MASFly\ub294 \uacbd\ud5d8 \uae30\ubc18 \uac10\ub3c5 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc804\ub2f4 Watcher \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c \uacbd\ud5d8 \ud480\uc744 \ucc38\uc870\ud558\uc5ec \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\ud558\uace0 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \uac1c\uc785\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 MASFly\ub294 TravelPlanner \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c 61.7%\uc758 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5 \uc801\uc751\uc131\uacfc \uacac\uace0\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Current agents lack independent legal identity, cannot hold assets, and cannot receive payments directly. We established fundamental differences between human and machine economic actors and demonstrated that existing human-centric infrastructure cannot support genuine agent autonomy. We showed that blockchain technology provides three critical properties enabling genuine agent autonomy: permissionless participation, trustless settlement, and machine-to-machine micropayments. We propose a five-layer architecture: (1) Physical Infrastructure (hardware & energy) through DePIN protocols; (2) Identity & Agency establishing on-chain sovereignty through W3C DIDs and reputation capital; (3) Cognitive & Tooling enabling intelligence via RAG and MCP; (4) Economic & Settlement ensuring financial autonomy through account abstraction; and (5) Collective Governance coordinating multi-agent systems through Agentic DAOs.

This work argues that such limitations do not primarily arise from insufficient learning, data, or model capacity, but from a deeper structural property of how intelligence is optimized over time. We formulate intelligence as a trajectory-level phenomenon governed by multi-objective trade-offs, and introduce Trajectory-Dominant Pareto Optimization, a path-wise generalization of classical Pareto optimality in which dominance is defined over full trajectories. Within this framework, Pareto traps emerge as locally non-dominated regions of trajectory space that nevertheless restrict access to globally superior developmental paths under conservative local optimization. To characterize the rigidity of such constraints, we define the Trap Escape Difficulty Index (TEDI), a composite geometric measure capturing escape distance, structural constraints, and behavioral inertia. We show that dynamic intelligence ceilings arise as inevitable geometric consequences of trajectory-level dominance, independent of learning progress or architectural scale. We further introduce a formal taxonomy of Pareto traps and illustrate the resulting trajectory-level divergence using a minimal agent-environment model. Together, these results shift the locus of intelligence from terminal performance to optimization geometry, providing a principled framework for diagnosing and overcoming long-horizon developmental constraints in adaptive systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc778\uacf5 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \ub9ce\uc740 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uc7a5\uae30

Tassis", "Azalea Rohr", "Mark Crovella"], "title": "Finding Highly Interpretable Prompt-Specific Circuits in Language Models", "comment": null, "summary": "Understanding the internal circuits that language models use to solve tasks remains a central challenge in mechanistic interpretability. Most prior work identifies circuits at the task level by averaging across many prompts, implicitly assuming a single stable mechanism per task. We show that this assumption can obscure a crucial source of structure: circuits are prompt-specific, even within a fixed task. Building on attention causal communication (ACC) (Franco & Crovella, 2025), we introduce ACC++, refinements that extract cleaner, lower-dimensional causal signals inside attention heads from a single forward pass. Like ACC, our approach does not require replacement models (e.g., SAEs) or activation patching; ACC++ further improves circuit precision by reducing attribution noise. Applying ACC++ to indirect object identification (IOI) in GPT-2, Pythia, and Gemma 2, we find there is no single circuit for IOI in any model: different prompt templates induce systematically different mechanisms. Despite this variation, prompts cluster into prompt families with similar circuits, and we propose a representative circuit for each family as a practical unit of analysis. Finally, we develop an automated interpretability pipeline that uses ACC++ signals to surface human-interpretable features and assemble mechanistic explanations for prompt families behavior.

Existing safety approaches emphasize alignment, interpretability, or action-level filtering. We argue that these mechanisms are necessary but insufficient because they do not directly govern selection power: the authority to determine which options are generated, surfaced, and framed for decision. We propose a governance architecture that separates cognition, selection, and action into distinct domains and models autonomy as a vector of sovereignty. Cognitive autonomy remains unconstrained, while selection and action autonomy are bounded through mechanically enforced primitives operating outside the agent's optimization space. The architecture integrates external candidate generation (CEFL), a governed reducer, commit-reveal entropy isolation, rationale validation, and fail-loud circuit breakers. We evaluate the system across multiple regulated financial scenarios under adversarial stress targeting variance manipulation, threshold gaming, framing skew, ordering effects, and entropy probing. Metrics quantify selection concentration, narrative diversity, governance activation cost, and failure visibility. Results show that mechanical selection governance is implementable, auditable, and prevents deterministic outcome capture while preserving reasoning capacity. Although probabilistic concentration remains, the architecture measurably bounds selection authority relative to conventional scalar pipelines. This work reframes governance as bounded causal power rather than internal intent alignment, offering a foundation for deploying autonomous agents where silent failure is unacceptable.", "AI":

This openness introduces a security misalignment: agents implicitly trust tools exposed by potentially untrusted MCP servers. However, despite its excellent utility, existing agents typically offer limited validation for third-party MCP servers. As a result, agents remain vulnerable to MCP-based attacks that exploit the misalignment between agents and servers throughout the tool invocation lifecycle. In this paper, we propose MCPShield as a plug-in security cognition layer that mitigates this misalignment and ensures agent security when invoking MCP-based tools. Drawing inspiration from human experience-driven tool validation, MCPShield assists agent forms security cognition with metadata-guided probing before invocation. Our method constrains execution within controlled boundaries while cognizing runtime events, and subsequently updates security cognition by reasoning over historical traces after invocation, building on human post-use reflection on tool behavior. Experiments demonstrate that MCPShield exhibits strong generalization in defending against six novel MCP-based attack scenarios across six widely used agentic LLMs, while avoiding false positives on benign servers and incurring low deployment overhead. Overall, our work provides a practical and robust security safeguard for MCP-based tool invocation in open agent ecosystems.", "AI": {"tldr": "MCPShield\ub294 MCP \uae30\ubc18 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc0ac\uc6a9 \uc2dc \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \ud50c\ub7ec\uadf8\uc778 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc778\uc9c0 \uacc4\uce35\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "MCP \uc11c\ubc84\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \ubd80\uc871\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 MCP \uae30\ubc18 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud574\uc9c0\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "MCPShield\ub294 \uba54\ud0c0\ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \ud638\ucd9c\ud558\uae30 \uc804 \ubcf4\uc548\uc744 \uc778\uc9c0\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ub3d5\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "MCPShield\ub294 \uc5ec\uc12f \uac00\uc9c0\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 MCP \uae30\ubc18 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ubc29\uc5b4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uac1c\ubc29\ud615 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc0dd\ud0dc\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c MCP \uae30\ubc18 \ub3c4\uad6c \ud638\ucd9c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ubcf4\uc548 \ubcf4\ud638 \uc218\ub2e8\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubaa8\ub378 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c(MCP)\uc740 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \ud45c\uc900\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uc81c3\uc790 \uc11c\ubc84\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uac1c\ubc29\uc131\uc740 \ud55c \uac00\uc9c0 \ubcf4\uc548 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 MCP \uc11c\ubc84\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ub178\ucd9c\ub41c \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uc554\ubb35\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uadf8 \uc720\uc6a9\uc131\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \uae30\uc874 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c3\uc790 MCP \uc11c\ubc84\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uac80\uc99d\ub9cc \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ub3c4\uad6c \ud638\ucd9c \uc0dd\uc560\uc8fc\uae30 \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \uc11c\ubc84 \uac04\uc758 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub97c \uc545\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 MCP \uae30\ubc18 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub97c \uc644\ud654\ud558\uace0 MCP \uae30\ubc18 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \ud638\ucd9c\ud560 \ub54c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \ud50c\ub7ec\uadf8\uc778 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc778\uc9c0 \uacc4\uce35\uc73c\ub85c MCPShield\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uacbd\ud5d8 \uae30\ubc18 \ub3c4\uad6c \uac80\uc99d\uc5d0\uc11c \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc544, MCPShield\ub294 \ud638\ucd9c \uc774\uc804\uc5d0 \uba54\ud0c0\ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc73c\ub85c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud615\ud0dc\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc778\uc9c0\ub97c \ubcf4\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc2e4\ud589\uc744 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub41c \uacbd\uacc4 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\ud55c\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ub7f0\ud0c0\uc784 \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8\ub97c \uc778\uc9c0\ud558\uace0, \ud638\ucd9c \ud6c4 \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801 \ud754\uc801\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ucd94\ub860\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc778\uc9c0\ub97c \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ud558\uc5ec \ub3c4\uad6c \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc0ac\uc6a9 \ud6c4 \ubc18\uc131\uc744 \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, MCPShield\ub294 \uc5ec\uc12f \uac00\uc9c0 \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 LLM\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5ec\uc12f \uac00\uc9c0 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 MCP \uae30\ubc18 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubc29\uc5b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\uba70, \uc815\uc0c1 \uc11c\ubc84\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \uae0d\uc815 \uc608\ub97c \ud53c\ud558\uace0 \ub0ae\uc740 \ubc30\ud3ec \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c \ubc1c\uc0dd\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc804\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uac1c\ubc29\ud615 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc0dd\ud0dc\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c MCP \uae30\ubc18 \ub3c4\uad6c \ud638\ucd9c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ubcf4\uc548 \ubcf4\ud638 \uc218\ub2e8\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Most prior work mitigates this issue with training-time solutions (e.g., data curation or alignment-oriented regularization). However, these approaches are costly to maintain as personas and attack strategies evolve, can degrade in-character behavior, and are typically infeasible for frontier closed-weight LLMs. We propose a training-free Dual-Cycle Adversarial Self-Evolution framework with two coupled cycles. A Persona-Targeted Attacker Cycle synthesizes progressively stronger jailbreak prompts, while a Role-Playing Defender Cycle distills observed failures into a hierarchical knowledge base of (i) global safety rules, (ii) persona-grounded constraints, and (iii) safe in-character exemplars. At inference time, the Defender retrieves and composes structured knowledge from this hierarchy to guide generation, producing responses that remain faithful to the target persona while satisfying safety constraints. Extensive experiments across multiple proprietary LLMs show consistent gains over strong baselines on both role fidelity and jailbreak resistance, and robust generalization to unseen personas and attack prompts.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5ed\ud560 \uc218\ud589\uc774 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\ub098, \ud398\ub974\uc18c\ub098 \uc81c\uc57d \uc900\uc218\ub294 jailbreak \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc5c6\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uae30\uc801 \uc0ac\uc774\ud074\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5ed\ud560 \uc218\ud589\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc774 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud398\ub974\uc18c\ub098 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ub354\uc6b1 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud558\uac8c \uc900\uc218\ud560\uc218\ub85d \uce68\uc785 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud6c8\ub828 \uc5c6\ub294 Dual-Cycle Adversarial Self-Evolution \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \uacb0\ud569\ub41c \uc0ac\uc774\ud074\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\ub2e4: \ud398\ub974\uc18c\ub098 \ud45c\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9\uc790 \uc0ac\uc774\ud074\uacfc \uc5ed\ud560 \uc218\ud589 \ubc29\uc5b4\uc790 \uc0ac\uc774\ud074\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub3c5\uc810 LLM\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc5ed\ud560 \ucda9\uc2e4\ub3c4\uc640 jailbreak \uc800\ud56d \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uae30\uc900\uc120 \ub300\ube44 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc774 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uc774\uc804 \ud398\ub974\uc18c\ub098 \ubc0f \uacf5\uaca9 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5ed\ud560 \uc218\ud589\uc740 \ube60\ub974\uac8c \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf30\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud398\ub974\uc18c\ub098 \uc81c\uc57d\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac15\ud55c \uc900\uc218\uac00 \uc885\uc885 jailbreak \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uc804 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub4e4\uc740 \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828 \uc2dc\uac04 \ub3d9\uc548\uc758 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158(\uc608: \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud050\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ub610\ub294 \uc815\ub82c \uc9c0\ud5a5\uc801 \uc815\uaddc\ud654)\uc73c\ub85c \uc644\ud654\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \ud398\ub974\uc18c\ub098\uc640 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc804\ub7b5\uc774 \uc9c4\ud654\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc720\uc9c0 \uad00\ub9ac \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4e4\uace0, \uce90\ub9ad\ud130 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc800\ud558\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd5c\uc804\uc120\uc758 \ud3d0\uc1c4 \uac00\uc911\uce58 LLM\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \uacb0\ud569\ub41c \uc0ac\uc774\ud074\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc774\uc911 \uc0ac\uc774\ud074 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc790\uae30 \uc9c4\ud654 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud398\ub974\uc18c\ub098 \ud45c\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9\uc790 \uc0ac\uc774\ud074\uc740 \uc810\uc9c4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac15\ub825\ud55c jailbreak \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \ud569\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ubc18\uba74, \uc5ed\ud560 \uc218\ud589 \ubc29\uc5b4\uc790 \uc0ac\uc774\ud074\uc740 \uad00\ucc30\ub41c \uc2e4\ud328\ub97c (i) \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uc548\uc804 \uaddc\uce59, (ii) \ud398\ub974\uc18c\ub098 \uae30\ubc18 \uc81c\uc57d, (iii) \uc548\uc804\ud55c \uce90\ub9ad\ud130 \uc608\uc2dc\uc758 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uc99d\ub958\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \ubc29\uc5b4\uc790\ub294 \uc774 \uacc4\uce35\uc5d0\uc11c \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uac80\uc0c9\ud558\uace0 \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc548\ub0b4\ud558\uace0, \uc548\uc804 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ub9cc\uc871\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ubaa9\ud45c \ud398\ub974\uc18c\ub098\uc5d0 \ucda9\uc2e4\ud55c \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub3c5\uc810 LLM\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc740 \uc5ed\ud560 \ucda9\uc2e4\ub3c4\uc640 jailbreak \uc800\ud56d \uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uae30\uc900\uc120\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uace0, \ubcf4\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c \ud398\ub974\uc18c\ub098\uc640 \uacf5\uaca9 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub3c4 \uc785\uc99d\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Sifting through these high-dimensional tradeoffs to infer the optimal patient-specific strategy is cognitively demanding and historically prone to variability. In this paper, we address this challenge within the context of High-Dose-Rate (HDR) brachytherapy for cervical cancer, where planning requires strictly managing radiation hot spots while balancing tumor coverage against organ sparing. We present ALMo (Aim-Limit-defined Multi-Objective system), an interactive decision support system designed to infer and operationalize clinician intent. ALMo employs a novel optimization framework that minimizes manual input through automated parameter setup and enables flexible control over toxicity risks. Crucially, the system allows clinicians to navigate the Pareto surface of dosimetric tradeoffs by directly manipulating intuitive aim and limit values. In a retrospective evaluation of 25 clinical cases, ALMo generated treatment plans that consistently met or exceeded manual planning quality, with 65% of cases demonstrating dosimetric improvements. Furthermore, the system significantly enhanced efficiency, reducing average planning time to approximately 17 minutes, compared to the conventional 30-60 minutes. While validated in brachytherapy, ALMo demonstrates a generalized framework for streamlining interaction in multi-criteria clinical decision-making.", "AI": {"tldr": "ALMo\ub294 \uc790\uad81\uacbd\ubd80\uc554\uc758 HDR \uc138\uce68 \ubc29\uc0ac\uc120\uce58\ub8cc\uc5d0\uc11c \uc784\uc0c1 \uc758\ub3c4\uc758 \uc2dc\ud589\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc801 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uc9c0\uc6d0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc73c\ub85c, \ub2e4\ucc28\uc6d0\uc801\uc778 \uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uce58\ub8cc \uacc4\ud68d\uc758 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba70 \uacc4\ud68d \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \ub2e8\ucd95\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc784\uc0c1 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc784\uc0c1 \uc758\uc0ac\ub4e4\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uacbd\uc7c1 \uc9c0\ud45c\ub97c \ucd94\uc801\ud574\uc57c \ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc778\uc9c0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd80\ub2f4\uc774 \ud06c\uace0 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc774 \uc2ec\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "ALMo\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \uc124\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc218\ub3d9 \uc785\ub825\uc744 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\uace0 \ub3c5\uc131 \uc704\ud5d8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc720\uc5f0\ud55c \uc81c\uc5b4\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "25\uba85\uc758 \uc784\uc0c1 \uc0ac\ub840\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud68c\uace0\uc801 \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0\uc11c ALMo\ub294 \uc218\ub3d9 \uacc4\ud68d \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\ub294 \uce58\ub8cc \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc600\uace0, 65%\uc758 \uc0ac\ub840\uc5d0\uc11c \uc120\ub7c9 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "ALMo\ub294 \ub2e4\uae30\uc900 \uc784\uc0c1 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uac04\uc18c\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc784\uc0c1 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc784\uc0c1 \uc758\uc0ac\ub4e4\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \ubaa9\ud45c(\uc774\uc0c1)\uc640 \ud55c\uacc4(\uc5c4\uaca9) \uc784\uacc4\uac12\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\uc758\ub41c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uacbd\uc7c1 \uc9c0\ud45c\ub97c \ucd94\uc801\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0\uc801\uc778 Tradeoff\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud658\uc790 \ub9de\ucda4\ud615 \ucd5c\uc801 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc720\ucd94\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc778\uc9c0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd80\ub2f4\uc774 \ud06c\uace0 \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc774 \ub192\uc558\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubc29\uc0ac\uc120\uc758 \uc5f4\uc810 \uad00\ub9ac\ub97c \uc5c4\uaca9\ud558\uac8c \uc218\ud589\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc885\uc591 \ud53c\ubcf5\uacfc \uc7a5\uae30 \ubcf4\ud638\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uc5b4\uc57c \ud558\ub294 \uc790\uad81\uacbd\ubd80\uc554\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uace0\uc120\ub7c9\uc728(HDR) \ubc29\uc0ac\uc120 \uce58\ub8cc\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8ec\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc784\uc0c1 \uc758\ub3c4\uc758 \uc720\ucd94 \ubc0f \uc6b4\uc601\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uc9c0\uc6d0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc778 ALMo(\ubaa9\ud45c-\ud55c\uacc4 \uc815\uc758 \ub2e4\ubaa9\uc801 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c)\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.

Among them, ``self-evolving'' MAS, treated as a more flexible and powerful technical route, can construct task-adaptive workflows or communication topologies, instead of relying on a predefined static structue template. Current self-evolving MAS mainly focus on Spatial Evolving or Temporal Evolving paradigm, which only considers the single dimension of evolution and does not fully incentivize LLMs' collaborative capability. In this work, we start from a novel Spatio-Temporal perspective by proposing ST-EVO, which supports dialogue-wise communication scheduling with a compact yet powerful flow-matching based Scheduler. To make precise Spatio-Temporal scheduling, ST-EVO can also perceive the uncertainty of MAS, and possesses self-feedback ability to learn from accumulated experience. Extensive experiments on nine benchmarks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of ST-EVO, achieving about 5%--25% accuracy improvement.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc790\uac00 \ubc1c\uc804 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(ST-EVO)\uc740 \ub300\ud654 \uae30\ubc18 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\ub9c1\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uba70, \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc2a4\ud398\uc774-\ud0c0\uc784 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\ub9c1\uacfc \uc790\uac00 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \uac16\ucd98\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud611\ub825 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\ud55c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c, \uc790\uac00 \ubc1c\uc804 MAS\ub294 \ub354 \uc720\uc5f0\ud558\uace0 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uae30\uc220 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc2a4\ud398\uc774-\ud0c0\uc784 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \ub300\ud654-wise \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\ub9c1\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 ST-EVO\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc544\ud649 \uac1c\uc758 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c ST-EVO\uc758 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uba70, \uc57d 5%\uc5d0\uc11c 25%\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "ST-EVO\ub294 \uc790\uac00 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ucd95\uc801\ub41c \uacbd\ud5d8\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ud559\uc2b5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uba70, \uc804\uccb4\uc801\uc778 \uc131\uacfc \uac1c\uc120\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "LLM \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(MAS)\uc740 \ud611\ub825 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c \ubd80\uc0c1\ud558\uc600\uace0, \ud3ed\ub113\uc740 \uc5f0\uad6c \uad00\uc2ec\uc744 \ub04c\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub4e4 \uc911\uc5d0\uc11c '\uc790\uac00 \ubc1c\uc804(self-evolving)' MAS\ub294 \ubbf8\ub9ac \uc815\uc758\ub41c \uc815\uc801 \uad6c\uc870 \ud15c\ud50c\ub9bf\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c \ub610\ub294 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ud1a0\ud3f4\ub85c\uc9c0\ub97c \uad6c\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub354 \uc720\uc5f0\ud558\uace0 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uae30\uc220 \uacbd\ub85c\ub85c \uac04\uc8fc\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uc790\uac00 \ubc1c\uc804 MAS\ub294 \uc8fc\ub85c \uacf5\uac04 \ubc1c\uc804(Spatial Evolving) \ub610\ub294 \uc2dc\uac04 \ubc1c\uc804(Temporal Evolving) \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc9c4\ud654\uc758 \ub2e8\uc77c \ucc28\uc6d0\ub9cc \uace0\ub824\ud558\uc5ec LLM\uc758 \ud611\ub825 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \uc790\uadf9\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub300\ud654 \uae30\ubc18 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\ub9c1\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 compact yet powerful flow-matching \uae30\ubc18 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\ub7ec\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacf5\uac04-\uc2dc\uac04(Spatio-Temporal) \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c ST-EVO\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uacf5\uac04-\uc2dc\uac04 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\ub9c1\uc744 \uc704\ud574 ST-EVO\ub294 MAS\uc758 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uc778\uc2dd\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ucd95\uc801\ub41c \uacbd\ud5d8\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \uc790\uac00 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \uac16\ucd94\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc544\ud649 \uac1c\uc758 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 ST-EVO\uc758 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uba70, \uc57d 5%~25%\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Automated exploitation systems can help validate these reports; however, existing approaches typically operate in isolation from detection pipelines, failing to leverage readily available metadata such as vulnerability type and source-code location. In this paper, we investigate how reported security vulnerabilities can be assessed in a realistic grey-box exploitation setting that leverages minimal vulnerability metadata, specifically a CWE classification and a vulnerable code location. We introduce Agentic eXploit Engine (AXE), a multi-agent framework for Web application exploitation that maps lightweight detection metadata to concrete exploits through decoupled planning, code exploration, and dynamic execution feedback. Evaluated on the CVE-Bench dataset, AXE achieves a 30% exploitation success rate, a 3x improvement over state-of-the-art black-box baselines. Even in a single-agent configuration, grey-box metadata yields a 1.75x performance gain. Systematic error analysis shows that most failed attempts arise from specific reasoning gaps, including misinterpreted vulnerability semantics and unmet execution preconditions. For successful exploits, AXE produces actionable, reproducible proof-of-concept artifacts, demonstrating its utility in streamlining Web vulnerability triage and remediation. We further evaluate AXE's generalizability through a case study on a recent real-world vulnerability not included in CVE-Bench.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uc545\uc6a9 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc778 AXE\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \uc2e4\uc81c \uadf8\ub808\uc774 \ubc15\uc2a4 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810 \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ucde8\uc57d\uc810 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub294 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \ud504\ub85c\uc81d\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc885\uc885 \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \uae0d\uc815 \uacb0\uacfc\uc640 \ube44\uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5 \ubcf4\uace0\uc11c\ub85c \uc720\uc9c0 \uad00\ub9ac\uc790\uc5d0\uac8c \ubd80\ub2f4\uc744 \uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud55c\uc758 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810 \uba54\ud0c0\ub370\uc774\ud130, \uc989 CWE \ubd84\ub958 \ubc0f \ucde8\uc57d\ud55c \ucf54\ub4dc \uc704\uce58\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uadf8\ub808\uc774 \ubc15\uc2a4 \uc545\uc6a9 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e0\uace0\ub41c \ubcf4\uc548 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Recent work adopts structured reasoning pipelines that translate natural language into first-order logic and delegate inference to automated solvers. With the rise of large language models, approaches such as GCD and CODE4LOGIC leverage their reasoning and code generation capabilities to improve logic parsing. However, these methods suffer from fragile syntax control due to weak enforcement of global grammar constraints and low semantic faithfulness caused by insufficient clause-level semantic understanding. We propose NL2LOGIC, a first-order logic translation framework that introduces an abstract syntax tree as an intermediate representation. NL2LOGIC combines a recursive large language model based semantic parser with an abstract syntax tree guided generator that deterministically produces solver-ready logic code. Experiments on the FOLIO, LogicNLI, and ProofWriter benchmarks show that NL2LOGIC achieves 99 percent syntactic accuracy and improves semantic correctness by up to 30 percent over state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, integrating NL2LOGIC into Logic-LM yields near-perfect executability and improves downstream reasoning accuracy by 31 percent compared to Logic-LM's original few-shot unconstrained translation module.", "AI": {"tldr": "NL2LOGIC\ub294 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4\ub97c 1\ucc28 \ub17c\ub9ac\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\u30fc\u30e0\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uad6c\ubb38 \ubd84\uc11d\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uacfc \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \uc62c\ubc14\ub984\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubc95\ub960 \ubc0f \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \ubb38\uc11c\uc758 \uc0ac\uc2e4\uacfc \uc8fc\uc7a5\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ucd94\ub860\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uacfc \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131.", "method": "NL2LOGIC\ub294 \ucd94\uc0c1 \uad6c\ubb38 \ud2b8\ub9ac\ub97c \uc911\uac04 \ud45c\ud604\uc73c\ub85c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\ub294 1\ucc28 \ub17c\ub9ac \ubcc0\ud658 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc7ac\uadc0\uc801 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8 \ubd84\uc11d\uae30\uc640 \uad6c\ubb38 \ud2b8\ub9ac \uc548\ub0b4 \uc0dd\uc131\uae30\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "NL2LOGIC\ub294 99% \uad6c\ubb38 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \uae30\uc874 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uae30\uc900\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ucd5c\ub300 30% \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Logic-LM\uc5d0 NL2LOGIC\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uba74 \uac70\uc758 \uc644\ubcbd\ud55c \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0, Logic-LM\uc758 \uc6d0\ub798 \uba87 \uc0f7 \ube44\uc81c\ud55c \ubc88\uc5ed \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ud558\uc704 \ucd94\ub860 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 31% \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ucd94\ub860\uc740 \ubb38\uc11c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc8fc\uc7a5\uc744 \uc0ac\uc2e4\uacfc \ub300\uc870\ud558\uc5ec \uac80\uc99d\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uacfc \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \uc694\uad6c\ub418\ub294 \ubc95\ub960 \ubc0f \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc \uc791\uc5c5\ub4e4\uc740 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4\ub97c 1\ucc28 \ub17c\ub9ac\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\uace0 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ud574\uacb0\uc0ac\uc5d0 \uc704\uc784\ud558\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \ucc44\ud0dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ubd80\uc0c1\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c GCD \ubc0f CODE4LOGIC\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\ub4e4\uc774 \uc774\ub4e4\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub17c\ub9ac \uad6c\ubb38 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uc804\uc138\uacc4 \ubb38\ubc95 \uc81c\uc57d\uc758 \uc57d\ud55c \uc2dc\ud589\uacfc \ubd88\ucda9\ubd84\ud55c \uc808\ucc28 \ub808\ubca8 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc774\ud574\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc758 \uc800\ud558\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ucde8\uc57d\ud55c \uad6c\ubb38 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub97c \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc911\uac04 \ud45c\ud604\uc73c\ub85c\uc11c \ucd94\uc0c1 \uad6c\ubb38 \ud2b8\ub9ac\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\ub294 1\ucc28 \ub17c\ub9ac \ubcc0\ud658 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 NL2LOGIC\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Airborne systems face a key challenge in extracting geomagnetic field data: the aircraft itself induces magnetic noise. Although the classical Tolles-Lawson model addresses this, it inadequately handles stochastically corrupted magnetic data required for navigation. To address stochastic noise, we propose a framework based on two physics-based constraints: divergence-free vector field and E(3)-equivariance. These ensure the learned magnetic field obeys Maxwell's equations and that outputs transform correctly with sensor position/orientation. The divergence-free constraint is implemented by training a neural network to output a vector potential $A$, with the magnetic field defined as its curl. For E(3)-equivariance, we use tensor products of geometric tensors representable via spherical harmonics with known rotational transformations. Enforcing physical consistency and restricting the admissible function space acts as an implicit regularizer that improves spatio-temporal performance. We present ablation studies evaluating each constraint alone and jointly across CNNs, MLPs, Liquid Time Constant models, and Contiformers. Continuous-time dynamics and long-term memory are critical for modelling magnetic time series; the Contiformer architecture, which provides both, outperforms state-of-the-art methods. To mitigate data scarcity, we generate synthetic datasets using the World Magnetic Model (WMM) with time-series conditional GANs, producing realistic, temporally consistent magnetic sequences across varied trajectories and environments.

Using a Transformer-based model, ROSA jointly predicts the future trajectories of vehicles and Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs) at roundabouts. Trained for single-step prediction and deployed autoregressively, it generates deterministic outputs, enabling actionable speed advisories. Incorporating motion dynamics, the model achieves high accuracy (ADE: 1.29m, FDE: 2.99m at a five-second prediction horizon), surpassing prior work. Adding route intention further improves performance (ADE: 1.10m, FDE: 2.36m), demonstrating the value of connected vehicle data. Based on predicted conflicts with VRUs and circulating vehicles, ROSA provides real-time, proactive speed advisories for approaching and entering the roundabout. Despite prediction uncertainty, ROSA significantly improves vehicle efficiency and safety, with positive effects even on perceived safety from a VRU perspective.

We log complete interaction trajectories (messages, actions, tool-call arguments/outputs) and assess safety using both an automated trajectory judge (AgentDoG-Qwen3-4B) and human review. Across 34 canonical cases, we find a non-uniform safety profile: performance is generally consistent on reliability-focused tasks, while most failures arise under underspecified intent, open-ended goals, or benign-seeming jailbreak prompts, where minor misinterpretations can escalate into higher-impact tool actions. We supplemented the overall results with representative case studies and summarized the commonalities of these cases, analyzing the security vulnerabilities and typical failure modes that Clawdbot is prone to trigger in practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "Clawdbot\uc740 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5 \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \uac16\ucd98 \uc790\uac00 \ud638\uc2a4\ud305 \uac1c\uc778 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c, \uc548\uc804\uc131\uacfc \ubcf4\uc548 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc6b0\ub824\ub97c \uc57c\uae30\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 Clawdbot\uc744 \uc5ec\uc12f \uac00\uc9c0 \uc704\ud5d8 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "motivation": "Clawdbot\uc740 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac1c\uc778 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c, \uc9c0\uc5ed \uc2e4\ud589\uacfc \uc6f9 \ub9e4\uac1c \uc791\uc5c5 \ud750\ub984\uc744 \uc544\uc6b0\ub974\uba70, \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uacfc \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc720\ub3c4 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \ub192\uc544\uc9c0\ub294 \uc548\uc804 \ubc0f \ubcf4\uc548 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8ec\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Clawdbot\uc758 \uc5ec\uc12f \uc704\ud5d8 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uada4\uc801 \uc911\uc2ec \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc2e4\uc2dc\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, 34\uac1c\uc758 \uc804\ud615\uc801\uc778 \uc0ac\ub840\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc548\uc804 \ud504\ub85c\ud544\uc740 \ube44\uade0\uc77c\ud558\uba70, \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uc911\uc2ec \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\ub294 \ubc18\uba74, \uc758\ub3c4 \ubd88\uba85\ud655, \uac1c\ubc29\ud615 \ubaa9\ud45c \ub610\ub294 \ubb34\ud574\ud55c \uae38\ucc3e\uae30 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\ud328\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 Clawdbot\uc758 \ubaa8\ubc94 \uc0ac\ub840\ub97c \ubcf4\ucda9\ud558\uace0, \ubcf4\uc548 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uacfc \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uc2e4\ud328 \ubaa8\ub4dc\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "Clawdbot\uc740 \uc9c0\uc5ed \uc2e4\ud589\uacfc \uc6f9 \ub9e4\uac1c\ud615 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud750\ub984\uc744 \uc544\uc6b0\ub974\ub294 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9 \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \uac16\ucd98 \uc790\uac00 \ud638\uc2a4\ud305 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uac1c\uc778 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c, \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uacfc \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc720\ub3c4 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \ub192\uc544\uc9c0\ub294 \uc548\uc804\uc131 \ubc0f \ubcf4\uc548 \uc6b0\ub824\ub97c \uc57c\uae30\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5ec\uc12f \uac00\uc9c0 \uc704\ud5d8 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc5d0\uc11c Clawdbot\uc758 \uada4\uc801 \uc911\uc2ec \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ubaa8\uc74c\uc740 \uc774\uc804\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc548\uc804 \uae30\uc900(ATBench \ubc0f LPS-Bench \ud3ec\ud568)\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub97c \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\ud558\uace0 \uc57d\uac04 \uc218\uc815\ud55c \ud6c4 Clawdbot\uc758 \ub3c4\uad6c \ud45c\uba74\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucd98 \uc218\uc791\uc5c5 \uc124\uacc4 \uc0ac\ub840\ub85c \ubcf4\uc644\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc804\uccb4 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uada4\uc801(\uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0, \ud589\ub3d9, \ub3c4\uad6c \ud638\ucd9c \uc778\uc790/\ucd9c\ub825)\uc744 \uae30\ub85d\ud558\uace0 \uc790\ub3d9 \uada4\uc801 \ud310\ub2e8\uc790(AgentDoG-Qwen3-4B)\uc640 \uc778\uac04 \ub9ac\ubdf0\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4. 34\uac1c\uc758 \uc804\ud615\uc801\uc778 \uc0ac\ub840\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ube44\uade0\uc77c\ud55c \uc548\uc804 \ud504\ub85c\ud544\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\ub2e4: \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uc911\uc2ec \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub300\ub2e4\uc218\uc758 \uc2e4\ud328\ub294 \uc758\ub3c4\uac00 \ubd88\uba85\ud655\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uac1c\ubc29\ud615 \ubaa9\ud45c \ub610\ub294 \ubb34\ud574\ud574 \ubcf4\uc774\ub294 \ud0c8\uc625 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacbd\uc6b0 \uc0ac\uc18c\ud55c \uc624\ud574\uac00 \ub354 \ud070 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \ub3c4\uad6c \ud589\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\ub300\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc804\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ub300\ud45c \uc0ac\ub840 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub85c \ubcf4\uc644\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc0ac\ub840\uc758 \uacf5\ud1b5\uc810\uc744 \uc694\uc57d\ud558\uba70, Clawdbot\uc774 \uc2e4\uc81c\ub85c \uc720\ubc1c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubcf4\uc548 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uacfc \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uc2e4\ud328 \ubaa8\ub4dc\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4."}}

We introduce DPBench, a benchmark based on the Dining Philosophers problem that evaluates LLM coordination across eight conditions that vary decision timing, group size, and communication. Our experiments with GPT-5.2, Claude Opus 4.5, and Grok 4.1 reveal a striking asymmetry: LLMs coordinate effectively in sequential settings but fail when decisions must be made simultaneously, with deadlock rates exceeding 95\\% under some conditions. We trace this failure to convergent reasoning, where agents independently arrive at identical strategies that, when executed simultaneously, guarantee deadlock. Contrary to expectations, enabling communication does not resolve this problem and can even increase deadlock rates. Our findings suggest that multi-agent LLM systems requiring concurrent resource access may need external coordination mechanisms rather than relying on emergent coordination.

Existing approaches either rely on static, potentially incomplete knowledge graphs, or prompt language models for functionally similar genes, retrieving associations shaped by symmetric co-occurrence in scientific text rather than directed regulatory logic. We introduce MechPert, a lightweight framework that encourages LLM agents to generate directed regulatory hypotheses rather than relying solely on functional similarity. Multiple agents independently propose candidate regulators with associated confidence scores; these are aggregated through a consensus mechanism that filters spurious associations, producing weighted neighborhoods for downstream prediction.

Quantum computing offers the potential to overcome this limitation by embedding data into exponentially large Hilbert spaces, capturing complex correlations that remain inaccessible to classical computing approaches. In this paper, we propose a Distributed Quantum Gaussian Process (DQGP) method in a multiagent setting to enhance modeling capabilities and scalability. To address the challenging non-Euclidean optimization problem, we develop a Distributed consensus Riemannian Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (DR-ADMM) algorithm that aggregates local agent models into a global model. We evaluate the efficacy of our method through numerical experiments conducted on a quantum simulator in classical hardware. We use real-world, non-stationary elevation datasets of NASA's Shuttle Radar Topography Mission and synthetic datasets generated by Quantum Gaussian Processes.

Its application to machine learning (ML) has gained significant attention, particularly for secure inference services deployed across multiple cloud virtual machines (VMs), where each VM acts as an MPC party. Model providers secret-share model weights, and users secret-share inputs, ensuring that each server operates only on random shares. While MPC provides strong cryptographic guarantees, it incurs substantial computational and communication overhead. Deep neural networks rely heavily on convolutional and fully connected layers, which require costly matrix multiplications in MPC. To reduce this cost, we propose leveraging low-rank decomposition (LRD) for linear layers, replacing one large matrix multiplication with two smaller ones. Each matrix multiplication in MPC incurs a round of communication, meaning decomposing one matrix multiplication into two leads to an additional communication round. Second, the added matrix multiplication requires an additional truncation step to maintain numerical precision. Since truncation itself requires communication and computation, these overheads can offset the gains from decomposition. To address this, we introduce two complementary optimizations: truncation skipping and efficient linear layer concatenation. Truncation skipping removes the extra truncation induced by LRD, while linear layer concatenation pipelines operations to hide the additional communication round. Together, these techniques mitigate the main overheads of LRD in MPC and improve overall efficiency. Our approach is broadly applicable across MPC protocols. Experiments show up to 25% speedup in n-PC and 33% in 3-PC protocols over full-rank baselines, along with up to 52% GPU energy savings and 88% reduction in offline-phase latency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \ub2e4\uc790 \uacc4\uc0b0(MPC)\uc758 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uc808\uac10\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc800\ub7ad\ud06c \ubd84\ud574(LRD)\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ud589\ub82c \uacf1\uc148\uc744 \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \ub354 \uc791\uc740 \ud589\ub82c \uacf1\uc148\uc73c\ub85c \ub300\uccb4\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \ud2b8\ub809\ucf00\uc774\uc158 \uc0dd\ub7b5 \ubc0f \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc120\ud615 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4 \uc5f0\uacb0 \ub4f1\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ubc0f \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c \uc644\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uc804\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "MPC\ub294 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \ub2f9\uc0ac\uc790\ub4e4\uc774 \uc785\ub825\uc744 \uacf5\uac1c\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uacf5\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ud568\uc218\ub97c \uacc4\uc0b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud574\uc900\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uba38\uc2e0\ub7ec\ub2dd\uc5d0\uc11c \ud2b9\ud788 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc \uac00\uc0c1 \uba38\uc2e0\uc5d0 \ubc30\ud3ec\ub41c \uc548\uc804\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc5d0 \ud070 \uc8fc\ubaa9\uc744 \ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc120\ud615 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc800\ub7ad\ud06c \ubd84\ud574(LRD)\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud558\ub098\uc758 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ud589\ub82c \uacf1\uc148\uc744 \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \ub354 \uc791\uc740 \ud589\ub82c \uacf1\uc148\uc73c\ub85c \uad50\uccb4\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud2b8\ub809\ucf00\uc774\uc158 \uc0dd\ub7b5 \ubc0f \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc120\ud615 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4 \uc5f0\uacb0\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, n-PC \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ub300 25%\uc758 \uc18d\ub3c4 \ud5a5\uc0c1, 3-PC \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ub300 33%\uc758 \uc18d\ub3c4 \ud5a5\uc0c1, GPU \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc808\uc57d \ucd5c\ub300 52%, \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc758 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc2dc\uac04 88% \uac10\uc18c\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 MPC \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \ub110\ub9ac \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uba70, \uc804\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uae30\uc5ec\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc548\uc804\ud55c \ub2e4\uc790 \uacc4\uc0b0(MPC)\uc740 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \ub2f9\uc0ac\uc790\ub4e4\uc774 \uc785\ub825\uc744 \uacf5\uac1c\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uacf5\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ud568\uc218\ub97c \uacc4\uc0b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud574\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uba38\uc2e0\ub7ec\ub2dd(ML)\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc751\uc6a9\uc740 \ud2b9\ud788 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc \uac00\uc0c1 \uba38\uc2e0(VM)\uc5d0 \ubc30\ud3ec\ub41c \uc548\uc804\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \ud070 \uc8fc\ubaa9\uc744 \ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uac01 VM\uc740 MPC \ub2f9\uc0ac\uc790\ub85c \uc791\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubaa8\ub378 \uc81c\uacf5\uc790\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378 \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub97c \ube44\uacf5\uc720\ud558\uace0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\ub294 \uc785\ub825\uc744 \ube44\uacf5\uc720\ud558\uc5ec \uac01 \uc11c\ubc84\uac00 \ubb34\uc791\uc704 \ubd84\ud560\ub85c\ub9cc \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

We argue this limitation stems from a critical architectural conflation: current systems treat memory, learning, and personalization as a unified capability rather than three distinct mechanisms requiring different infrastructure, operating on different timescales, and benefiting from independent optimization. We propose MAPLE (Memory-Adaptive Personalized LEarning), a principled decomposition where Memory handles storage and retrieval infrastructure; Learning extracts intelligence from accumulated interactions asynchronously; and Personalization applies learned knowledge in real-time within finite context budgets. Each component operates as a dedicated sub-agent with specialized tooling and well-defined interfaces.

Despite recent progress, such formulations often struggle in complex and evolving settings, largely because most forecasting models lack the ability to autonomously acquire informative evidence, reason about potential future changes, or revise predictions through iterative decision processes. In this work, we propose Cast-R1, a learned time series forecasting framework that reformulates forecasting as a sequential decision-making problem. Cast-R1 introduces a memory-based state management mechanism that maintains decision-relevant information across interaction steps, enabling the accumulation of contextual evidence to support long-horizon reasoning. Building on this formulation, forecasting is carried out through a tool-augmented agentic workflow, in which the agent autonomously interacts with a modular toolkit to extract statistical features, invoke lightweight forecasting models for decision support, perform reasoning-based prediction, and iteratively refine forecasts through self-reflection. To train Cast-R1, we adopt a two-stage learning strategy that combines supervised fine-tuning with multi-turn reinforcement learning, together with a curriculum learning scheme that progressively increases task difficulty to improve policy learning. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world time series datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of Cast-R1. We hope this work provides a practical step towards further exploration of agentic paradigms for time series modeling.

Flow theory suggests that when job demands misalign with practitioner capabilities, work becomes overwhelming or tedious rather than engaging. Achieving challenge-skill balance begins at hiring: if job descriptions inaccurately portray requirements, organizations risk recruiting underskilled practitioners who face anxiety or overskilled ones who experience boredom. Yet we lack empirical understanding of what current SOC job descriptions actually specify. We analyzed 106 public SOC job postings from November to December 2024 across 35 organizations in 11 countries, covering Analysts (n=17), Incident Responders (n=38), Threat Hunters (n=39), and SOC Managers (n=12). Using Inductive Content Analysis, we coded certifications, technical skills, soft skills, tasks, and experience requirements. Three patterns emerged: (1) Communication skills dominate (50.9% of postings), exceeding SIEM tools (18.9%) or programming (30.2%), suggesting organizations prioritize collaboration over technical capabilities. (2) Certification expectations vary widely: CISSP leads (22.6%), but 43 distinct credentials appear with no universal standard. (3) Technical requirements show consensus: Python dominates programming (27.4%), Splunk leads SIEM platforms (14.2%), and ISO 27001 (13.2%) and NIST (10.4%) are most cited standards. These findings enable organizations to audit job descriptions against empirical baselines, help practitioners identify valued certifications and skills, and allow researchers to validate whether stated requirements align with actual demands. This establishes the foundation for flow-aligned interview protocols and investigation of how AI reshapes requirements.

We propose a Real-Time Physics-Driven Fourier-Spectral (PDF) solver that achieves sub-second reconstruction through spectral-domain dimensionality reduction. By expanding induced currents using a truncated Fourier basis, the optimization is confined to a compact low-frequency parameter space supported by scattering measurements. The solver integrates a contraction integral equation (CIE) to mitigate high-contrast nonlinearity and a contrast-compensated operator (CCO) to correct spectral-induced attenuation. Furthermore, a bridge-suppressing loss is formulated to enhance boundary sharpness between adjacent scatterers. Numerical and experimental results demonstrate a 100-fold speedup over state-of-the-art UNNs with robust performance under noise and antenna uncertainties, enabling real-time microwave imaging applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub192\uc740 \ucda9\uc2e4\ub3c4\uc758 \uc804\uc790\uae30 \uc5ed \uc0b0\ub780 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \ubb3c\ub9ac \uae30\ubc18 \ud478\ub9ac\uc5d0-\uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc(PDF) \ud574\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774 \ud574\ubc95\uc740 \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc \uc601\uc5ed \ucc28\uc6d0 \ucd95\uc18c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 1\ucd08 \uc774\ub0b4\uc758 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud6c8\ub828\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(UNN)\uc740 \ub192\uc740 \ucda9\uc2e4\ub3c4\uc758 \uc804\uc790\uae30 \uc5ed \uc0b0\ub780 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \uacf5\uac04 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\ud55c\uc744 \ubc1b\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc720\ub3c4 \uc804\ub958\ub97c \uc798\ub9b0 \ud478\ub9ac\uc5d0 \uae30\uc800\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud655\ub300\ud558\uace0, \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uac00 \uc0b0\ub780 \uce21\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ub418\ub294 \uc800\uc8fc\ud30c \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0 \uad6d\ud55c\ub418\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\uc5ec \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \ubb3c\ub9ac \uae30\ubc18 \ud478\ub9ac\uc5d0-\uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc \ud574\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "CIE(\ucd95\uc18c \uc801\ubd84 \ubc29\uc815\uc2dd)\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ub192\uc740 \ub300\ube44 \ube44\uc120\ud615\uc131\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\uace0, \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc \uc720 induced \uac10\uc1e0\ub97c \ubcf4\uc815\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 CCO(\ub300\ube44 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc790)\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc5bb\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc218\uce58\uc801 \ubc0f \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc7a1\uc74c\uacfc \uc548\ud14c\ub098 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 UNN\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 100\ubc30\uc758 \uc18d\ub3c4 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5b4 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \ub9c8\uc774\ud06c\ub85c\ud30c \uc774\ubbf8\uc9d5 \uc751\uc6a9\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud6c8\ub828\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(UNN)\uc740 \ub192\uc740 \ucda9\uc2e4\ub3c4\uc758 \uc804\uc790\uae30 \uc5ed \uc0b0\ub780 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \uacf5\uac04 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\ud55c\uc744 \ubc1b\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc \uc601\uc5ed \ucc28\uc6d0 \ucd95\uc18c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 1\ucd08 \uc774\ub0b4\uc758 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \ubb3c\ub9ac \uae30\ubc18 \ud478\ub9ac\uc5d0-\uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc(PDF) \ud574\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc720\ub3c4 \uc804\ub958\ub97c \uc798\ub9b0 \ud478\ub9ac\uc5d0 \uae30\uc800\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uac00 \uc0b0\ub780 \uce21\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ub418\ub294 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud55c\uc758 \uc800\uc8fc\ud30c \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0 \uad6d\ud55c\ub418\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud574\ubc95\uc740 \ub192\uc740 \ub300\ube44 \ube44\uc120\ud615\uc131\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ucd95\uc18c \uc801\ubd84 \ubc29\uc815\uc2dd(CIE)\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uace0, \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc \uc720\ub3c4 \uac10\uc1e0\ub97c \ubcf4\uc815\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub300\ube44 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc790(CCO)\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub354\uc6b1\uc774, \uc778\uc811\ud55c \uc0b0\ub780\uccb4 \uc0ac\uc774\uc758 \uacbd\uacc4 \uc120\uba85\ub3c4\ub97c \ub192\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uacbd\uacc4 \uc5b5\uc81c \uc190\uc2e4\uc744 \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc218\uce58\uc801 \ubc0f \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc7a1\uc74c\uacfc \uc548\ud14c\ub098 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \ucd5c\uc2e0 UNN\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 100\ubc30\uc758 \uc18d\ub3c4 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uc774\ub04c\uc5b4\ub0b4\uc5b4 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \ub9c8\uc774\ud06c\ub85c\ud30c \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uc751\uc6a9\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

We explore the potential for steganographic CoT -- where models hide secret reasoning within innocuous text -- to inform risk assessment and deployment policies. We systematically evaluate the limits of steganographic capabilities across 28 models, ranging from past generations to the current frontier. We measure monitor evasion, refusal rates, encoding fidelity, and hidden task accuracy across four datasets, comparing steganographic acrostics against plain reasoning and filler-token baselines. We find that current models cannot yet sustain hidden reasoning for complex math and arithmetic tasks. However, in a simplified counting experiment, Claude Opus 4.5 achieved 92% accuracy on the hidden task, demonstrating nascent capability. Notably, in rare cases (<1%), GPT-5.2 might refuse steganographic instructions while simultaneously complying with them. Our findings underscore the need for continuous evaluation of steganographic risks. This study provides a methodology to preemptively detect and prevent hidden reasoning that might empower misaligned scheming and deceptive behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294

We introduce TemporalBench, a multi-domain benchmark designed to evaluate temporal reasoning behavior under progressively richer informational settings. TemporalBench adopts a four-tier task taxonomy that examines historical structure interpretation, context-free forecasting, contextual temporal reasoning, and event-conditioned prediction across four real-world domains: retail, healthcare, energy, and physical systems. By controlling access to future targets and contextual information, the benchmark enables a diagnostic analysis of whether models can correctly interpret temporal patterns, align them with external context, and adapt predictions when conditions change. Extensive baseline experiments show that strong numerical forecasting accuracy does not reliably translate into robust contextual or event-aware temporal reasoning; instead, existing agent frameworks exhibit fragmented strengths and systematic failure modes that remain largely hidden under forecasting-only benchmarks.

However, most existing methods frame anomaly detection as a purely discriminative prediction task with fixed feature inputs, rather than an evidence-driven diagnostic process. As a result, they often struggle when anomalies exhibit strong context dependence or diverse patterns. We argue that these limitations stem from the lack of adaptive feature preparation, reasoning-aware detection, and iterative refinement during inference. To address these challenges, we propose AnomaMind, an agentic time series anomaly detection framework that reformulates anomaly detection as a sequential decision-making process. AnomaMind operates through a structured workflow that progressively localizes anomalous intervals in a coarse-to-fine manner, augments detection through multi-turn tool interactions for adaptive feature preparation, and refines anomaly decisions via self-reflection. The workflow is supported by a set of reusable tool engines, enabling context-aware diagnostic analysis. A key design of AnomaMind is an explicitly designed hybrid inference mechanism for tool-augmented anomaly detection. In this mechanism, general-purpose models are responsible for autonomous tool interaction and self-reflective refinement, while core anomaly detection decisions are learned through reinforcement learning under verifiable workflow-level feedback, enabling task-specific optimization within a flexible reasoning framework. Extensive experiments across diverse settings demonstrate that AnomaMind consistently improves anomaly detection performance.

Submission to First Proof February 2026 (arxiv:2602.05192, https://1stproof.org/), uploaded 20:07 Friday, 13 February 2026 Pacific Time (PT)", "summary": "This monograph reports a multi-agent proof sprint on ten research-level problems, combining rapid draft generation with adversarial verification, targeted repair, and explicit provenance. The workflow uses wiring-diagram decompositions of claim dependencies to localize gaps and coordinate reviewer-driven revisions. Final outcomes are heterogeneous but explicit: the manuscript distinguishes mathematical status from QC-validation status. Mathematically, Problem~3 has a validation-complete existence path under the scoped criterion used here (uniqueness/irreducibility treated as optional), Problem 5 is solved in a scope-limited form for $F_O$-local connective spectra, Problem 10 is conditional under clearly stated assumptions (with explicit necessity counterexamples when assumptions are dropped), and Problems 4 and 6 are partial with named remaining obligations in the general case (including an unconditional $K_n$ result for Problem 6 with $c_0 = 1/3$). Problem 7 is treated as provisionally closed via the rotation-route theorem chain, pending independent ledger re-check. At the QC layer, Problems~7 and~9 have node-level validation artifacts but still contain unresolved verifier gaps. The main methodological result is that structure-aware verification and layer-switching strategies improve reliability and calibration in compressed proof sprints.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774

However, current AI safety evaluation systems suffer from critical limitations such as restricted risk dimensions and failed frontier risk detection. The lagging safety benchmarks and alignment technologies can hardly address the complex challenges posed by cutting-edge AI models. To bridge this gap, we propose the \"ForesightSafety Bench\" AI Safety Evaluation Framework, beginning with 7 major Fundamental Safety pillars and progressively extends to advanced Embodied AI Safety, AI4Science Safety, Social and Environmental AI risks, Catastrophic and Existential Risks, as well as 8 critical industrial safety domains, forming a total of 94 refined risk dimensions. To date, the benchmark has accumulated tens of thousands of structured risk data points and assessment results, establishing a widely encompassing, hierarchically clear, and dynamically evolving AI safety evaluation framework. Based on this benchmark, we conduct systematic evaluation and in-depth analysis of over twenty mainstream advanced large models, identifying key risk patterns and their capability boundaries. The safety capability evaluation results reveals the widespread safety vulnerabilities of frontier AI across multiple pillars, particularly focusing on Risky Agentic Autonomy, AI4Science Safety, Embodied AI Safety, Social AI Safety and Catastrophic and Existential Risks.

Using ETHICS, Scruples, WildJailbreak, and our new robustness test, ETHICS-Contrast, we measure performance via our proposed Unified Moral Safety Score (UMSS), a metric balancing accuracy and safety. Our results show that compact, exemplar-guided scaffolds outperform complex multi-stage reasoning, providing higher UMSS scores and greater robustness at a lower token cost.

However, heterogeneity across devices and frequent sensor dropout pose significant challenges for unified modelling of these multimodal signals. We present \\texttt{sleep2vec}, a foundation model for diverse and incomplete nocturnal biosignals that learns a shared representation via cross-modal alignment. \\texttt{sleep2vec} is contrastively pre-trained on 42,249 overnight recordings spanning nine modalities using a \\textit{Demography, Age, Site \\& History-aware InfoNCE} objective that incorporates physiological and acquisition metadata (\\textit{e.g.}, age, gender, recording site) to dynamically weight negatives and mitigate cohort-specific shortcuts. On downstream sleep staging and clinical outcome assessment, \\texttt{sleep2vec} consistently outperforms strong baselines and remains robust to any subset of available modalities and sensor dropout. We further characterize, to our knowledge for the first time, scaling laws for nocturnal biosignals with respect to modality diversity and model capacity. Together, these results show that unified cross-modal alignment, coupled with principled scaling, enables label-efficient, general-purpose modelling of real-world nocturnal biosignals.", "AI":

However, in heterogeneous multi-agent systems (HMAS), capability differences among agents give rise to consistent cognitive problems, where strong and weak models fail to contribute effectively. We define the collaboration as a strong-weak system. Through comprehensive experiments, we disclose a counterintuitive phenomenon in the strong-weak system: a strong-weak collaboration may under-perform weak-weak combinations, revealing that cognitive mismatching are key bottlenecks limiting heterogeneous cooperation. To overcome these challenges, we propose an Entropy-Based Adaptive Guidance Framework that dynamically aligns the guidance with the cognitive state of each agent. The framework quantifies the understanding of weak agents through multi-dimensional entropy metrics - covering expression, uncertainty, structure, coherence, and relevance - and adaptively adjusts the intensity of the guidance at light, moderate and intensive levels. Furthermore, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism is incorporated to retain successful collaboration experiences, enabling both immediate adaptation and long-term learning. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, GSM8K, MBPP, and CVRP demonstrate that our approach consistently enhances the effectiveness and stability of heterogeneous collaboration. The results highlight that adaptive guidance not only mitigates cognitive imbalance but also establishes a scalable pathway toward more robust, cooperative multi-agent intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud611\uc5c5 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uad6c\uc870\uc5d0\uc11c \ud611\ub825\uc801 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc744 \uac16\ucd98 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\ud658\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc548\ub0b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uac01 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc778\uc9c0 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc548\ub0b4\ub97c \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "GSM8K, MBPP, CVRP\uc758 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ud611\uc5c5\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc548\ub0b4\ub294 \uc778\uc9c0 \ubd88\uade0\ud615\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud560 \ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \ub354 \uac15\ub825\ud558\uace0 \ud611\ub825\uc801\uc778 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\uc544\uac00\ub294 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc\uc758 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \ucd94\ub860, \uacc4\ud68d \ubc0f \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5 \uc0dd\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud601\uc2e0\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uace0\ub9bd\ub41c \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uad6c\uc870\uc5d0\uc11c \ud611\ub825\uc801 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc744 \uac16\ucd98 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\ud658\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(HMAS)\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825 \ucc28\uc774\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uc57d\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uae30\uc5ec\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uc778\uc9c0 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc77c\uc73c\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud611\uc5c5\uc744 \uac15\uc57d \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\uc758\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc885\ud569\uc801\uc778 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uac15\uc57d \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc18\uc9c1\uad00\uc801\uc778 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \ubc1d\ud600\ub0c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uac15\uc57d \ud611\uc5c5\uc740 \uc57d\ud55c-\uc57d\ud55c \uc870\ud569\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ub5a8\uc5b4\uc9c8 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc778\uc9c0 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\uac00 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ud611\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud558\ub294 \uc8fc\uc694 \ubcd1\ubaa9\ud604\uc0c1\uc784\uc744 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac01 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc778\uc9c0 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucdb0 \uc548\ub0b4\ub97c \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc548\ub0b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ud45c\ud604, \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131, \uad6c\uc870, \uc77c\uad00\uc131 \ubc0f \uad00\ub828\uc131\uc744 \ud3ec\uad04\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\ucc28\uc6d0 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc57d\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc774\ud574\ub97c \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\uace0, \uacbd\ubbf8\ud55c, \uc911\uac04, \uac15\ud55c \uc218\uc900\uc5d0\uc11c \uc548\ub0b4\uc758 \uac15\ub3c4\ub97c \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc778 \ud611\uc5c5 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uac80\uc0c9 \uc99d\uac15 \uc0dd\uc131(RAG) \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc989\uac01\uc801\uc778 \uc801\uc751\uacfc \uc7a5\uae30 \ud559\uc2b5\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Human institutions achieve reliable collective behaviour differently: they mitigate the risk posed by misaligned individuals through organisational structure. Multi-agent AI systems should follow this institutional model using compartmentalisation and adversarial review to achieve reliable outcomes through architectural design rather than assuming individual alignment.\n  We demonstrate this approach through the Perseverance Composition Engine, a multi-agent system for document composition. The Composer drafts text, the Corroborator verifies factual substantiation with full source access, and the Critic evaluates argumentative quality without access to sources: information asymmetry enforced by system architecture. This creates layered verification: the Corroborator detects unsupported claims, whilst the Critic independently assesses coherence and completeness. Observations from 474 composition tasks (discrete cycles of drafting, verification, and evaluation) exhibit patterns consistent with the institutional hypothesis. When assigned impossible tasks requiring fabricated content, this iteration enabled progression from attempted fabrication toward honest refusal with alternative proposals--behaviour neither instructed nor individually incentivised. These findings motivate controlled investigation of whether architectural enforcement produces reliable outcomes from unreliable components.\n  This positions organisational theory as a productive framework for multi-agent AI safety. By implementing verification and evaluation as structural properties enforced through information compartmentalisation, institutional design offers a route to reliable collective behaviour from unreliable individual components.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744

Recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shifted toward code-driven approaches. However, they frequently suffer from hallucinated logic and logic entanglement, where monolithic code generation leads to unrecoverable runtime failures. In this paper, we present iML, a novel multi-agent framework designed to shift AutoML from black-box prompting to a code-guided, modular, and verifiable architectural paradigm. iML introduces three main ideas: (1) Code-Guided Planning, which synthesizes a strategic blueprint grounded in autonomous empirical profiling to eliminate hallucination; (2) Code-Modular Implementation, which decouples preprocessing and modeling into specialized components governed by strict interface contracts; and (3) Code-Verifiable Integration, which enforces physical feasibility through dynamic contract verification and iterative self-correction. We evaluate iML across MLE-BENCH and the newly introduced iML-BENCH, comprising a diverse range of real-world Kaggle competitions. The experimental results show iML's superiority over state-of-the-art agents, achieving a valid submission rate of 85% and a competitive medal rate of 45% on MLE-BENCH, with an average standardized performance score (APS) of 0.77. On iML-BENCH, iML significantly outperforms the other approaches by 38%-163% in APS. Furthermore, iML maintains a robust 70% success rate even under stripped task descriptions, effectively filling information gaps through empirical profiling. These results highlight iML's potential to bridge the gap between stochastic generation and reliable engineering, marking a meaningful step toward truly AutoML.", "AI": {"tldr": "iML\uc740

We argue that as research generation becomes cheap, auditability becomes the bottleneck, and the dominant risk shifts from isolated factual errors to scientifically styled outputs whose claim-evidence links are weak, missing, or misleading. This perspective proposes claim-level auditability as a first-class design and evaluation target for deep research agents, distills recurring long-horizon failure modes (objective drift, transient constraints, and unverifiable inference), and introduces the Auditable Autonomous Research (AAR) standard, a compact measurement framework that makes auditability testable via provenance coverage, provenance soundness, contradiction transparency, and audit effort. We then argue for semantic provenance with protocolized validation: persistent, queryable provenance graphs that encode claim--evidence relations (including conflicts) and integrate continuous validation during synthesis rather than after publication, with practical instrumentation patterns to support deployment at scale.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc5f0\uad6c \uc0dd\uc131\uc774 \uc800\ub834\ud574\uc9d0\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uac10\uc0ac \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ub5a0\uc624\ub974\uba70, \uc624\ub958\uac00 \uc544\ub2cc \ucda9\ubd84\ud55c \ub4b7\ubc1b\uce68\uc774 \uacb0\uc5ec\ub41c \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \uacb0\uacfc\ubb3c\uc774 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc704\ud5d8 \uc694\uc18c\uac00 \ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5f0\uad6c \uc0dd\uc131\uc758 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub0ae\uc544\uc9d0\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uac10\uc0ac \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \uacb0\uacfc\ubb3c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud544\uc694\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc9c4\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc8fc\uc7a5 \uc218\uc900 \uac10\uc0ac \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uae4a\uc740 \uc5f0\uad6c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ub514\uc790\uc778\ud558\uace0 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc640 AAR \ud45c\uc900\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \uc8fc\uc7a5-\uc99d\uac70 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uc2dc\uac01\ud654\ud558\uace0, \uac10\uc0ac \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4dc\ub294 AAR \ud45c\uc900\uc774 \uc81c\uc2dc\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uac80\uc99d\uacfc \ud568\uaed8 \uc124\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ucd9c\ucc98 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \uac10\uc0ac \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud655\ubcf4\ud558\uace0, \uc804\ud1b5\uc801 \ucd9c\ud310 \uc774\ud6c4 \uac80\uc99d \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ub118\uc5b4\uc11c\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub525 \ub9ac\uc11c\uce58 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uba87 \ubd84 \uc548\uc5d0 \uc720\ucc3d\ud55c \uacfc\ud559 \ubcf4\uace0\uc11c\ub97c \uc0dd\uc0b0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ud6c4 \uc2e0\uc911\ud55c \ub3c5\uc790\uac00 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc8fc\uc7a5\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\ub824\uace0 \uc2dc\ub3c4\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ub3c5\ub3c5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc758 \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ube44\uc6a9\uc740 \ud2b9\uc815 \uad6c\ubb38\uc774 \uc5b4\ub5a4 \uad6c\uc808\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ub418\ub294\uc9c0, \ubb34\uc5c7\uc774 \ubb34\uc2dc\ub418\uc5c8\ub294\uc9c0, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uc99d\uac70\uac00 \ucda9\ub3cc\ud558\ub294\uc9c0 \ucd94\uc801\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774\uc784\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5f0\uad6c \uc0dd\uc131\uc774 \uc800\ub834\ud574\uc9d0\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uac10\uc0ac \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc774 \ub418\uace0, \ub2e8\ub3c5 \uc0ac\uc2e4 \uc624\ub958\uc5d0\uc11c \uacfc\ud559\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c\ub9c1\ub41c \uacb0\uacfc\ubb3c\ub85c \uc8fc\ub41c \uc704\ud5d8\uc774 \uc774\ub3d9\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uad00\uc810\uc740 \uc8fc\uc7a5 \uc218\uc900 \uac10\uc0ac \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ub525 \ub9ac\uc11c\uce58 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc77c\uae09 \ub514\uc790\uc778 \ubc0f \ud3c9\uac00 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0 \ubc18\ubcf5\ub418\ub294 \uc7a5\uae30\uc801 \uc2e4\ud328 \ubaa8\ub4dc(\ubaa9\ud45c \uc774\ud0c8, \uc77c\uc2dc\uc801 \uc81c\uc57d, \uac80\uc99d\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \ucd94\ub860)\ub97c \uc815\uc81c\ud558\uba70, \uac10\uc0ac \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc815\ud655\ud788 \uce21\uc815\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 AAR \ud45c\uc900, \uc989 \ucd9c\ucc98 \ucee4\ubc84\ub9ac\uc9c0, \ucd9c\ucc98 \ud0c0\ub2f9\uc131, \ubaa8\uc21c \ud22c\uba85\uc131, \uac10\uc0ac \ub178\ub825\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uce21\uc815\ub418\ub294 compact measurement framework\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7f0 \ub2e4\uc74c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc81c\ub3c4\ud654\ub41c \uac80\uc99d\uacfc \ud568\uaed8 \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc801 \ucd9c\ucc98\ub97c \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uc8fc\uc7a5-\uc99d\uac70 \uad00\uacc4(\ucda9\ub3cc \ud3ec\ud568)\ub97c \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ud558\uace0 \ud569\uc131 \uc911 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uc9c0\uc18d \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \ucffc\ub9ac \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ucd9c\ucc98 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uc5ec \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ubc30\ud3ec\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uae30\uad6c \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ub9c8\ub828\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, collecting authentic data is challenging due to privacy concerns and the high cost of longitudinal studies. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising path to student simulation, they suffer from competency bias, optimizing for efficient correctness rather than the erratic, iterative struggle characteristic of novice learners. We present BEAGLE, a neuro-symbolic framework that addresses this bias by incorporating Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) theory into a novel architecture. BEAGLE integrates three key technical innovations: (1) a semi-Markov model that governs the timing and transitions of cognitive behaviors and metacognitive behaviors; (2) Bayesian Knowledge Tracing with explicit flaw injection to enforce realistic knowledge gaps and \"unknown unknowns\"; and (3) a decoupled agent design that separates high-level strategy use from code generation actions to prevent the model from silently correcting its own intentional errors. In evaluations on Python programming tasks, BEAGLE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in reproducing authentic trajectories.

In practice, the environmental feedback is usually sparse and delayed. Learning from such signals is challenging, as LMs must implicitly infer how observed failures should translate into behavioral changes for future iterations. We introduce Experiential Reinforcement Learning (ERL), a training paradigm that embeds an explicit experience-reflection-consolidation loop into the reinforcement learning process. Given a task, the model generates an initial attempt, receives environmental feedback, and produces a reflection that guides a refined second attempt, whose success is reinforced and internalized into the base policy. This process converts feedback into structured behavioral revision, improving exploration and stabilizing optimization while preserving gains at deployment without additional inference cost. Across sparse-reward control environments and agentic reasoning benchmarks, ERL consistently improves learning efficiency and final performance over strong reinforcement learning baselines, achieving gains of up to +81% in complex multi-step environments and up to +11% in tool-using reasoning tasks.

However, these models require vast and diverse training data. Federated learning (FL) addresses this challenge by leveraging private data from heterogeneous edge devices for privacy-preserving MoE training. Nonetheless, traditional FL approaches require devices to host local MoE models, which is impractical for resource-constrained devices due to large model sizes. To address this, we propose DeepFusion, the first scalable federated MoE training framework that enables the fusion of heterogeneous on-device LLM knowledge via federated knowledge distillation, yielding a knowledge-abundant global MoE model. Specifically, DeepFusion features each device to independently configure and train an on-device LLM tailored to its own needs and hardware limitations. Furthermore, we propose a novel View-Aligned Attention (VAA) module that integrates multi-stage feature representations from the global MoE model to construct a predictive perspective aligned with on-device LLMs, thereby enabling effective cross-architecture knowledge distillation. By explicitly aligning predictive perspectives, VAA resolves the view-mismatch problem in traditional federated knowledge distillation, which arises from heterogeneity in model architectures and prediction behaviors between on-device LLMs and the global MoE model. Experiments with industry-level MoE models (Qwen-MoE and DeepSeek-MoE) and real-world datasets (medical and finance) demonstrate that DeepFusion achieves performance close to centralized MoE training. Compared with key federated MoE baselines, DeepFusion reduces communication costs by up to 71% and improves token perplexity by up to 5.28%.", "AI": {"tldr": "DeepFusion\uc740 \uc790\uc6d0\uc758

The demand for consistent and defensible decisions under heterogeneous risk profiles exposes limitations in institutional review capacity rather than in the legitimacy of ethics oversight. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities to support ethics review, but their direct application remains limited by insufficient ethical reasoning capability, weak integration with regulatory structures, and strict privacy constraints on authentic review materials. In this work, we introduce Mirror, an agentic framework for AI-assisted ethical review that integrates ethical reasoning, structured rule interpretation, and multi-agent deliberation within a unified architecture. At its core is EthicsLLM, a foundational model fine-tuned on EthicsQA, a specialized dataset of 41K question-chain-of-thought-answer triples distilled from authoritative ethics and regulatory corpora. EthicsLLM provides detailed normative and regulatory understanding, enabling Mirror to operate in two complementary modes. Mirror-ER (expedited Review) automates expedited review through an executable rule base that supports efficient and transparent compliance checks for minimal-risk studies. Mirror-CR (Committee Review) simulates full-board deliberation through coordinated interactions among expert agents, an ethics secretary agent, and a principal investigator agent, producing structured, committee-level assessments across ten ethical dimensions. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Mirror significantly improves the quality, consistency, and professionalism of ethics assessments compared with strong generalist LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8, \ub2e4\ud559\uc81c \uc5f0\uad6c\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uc724\ub9ac\uc801 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 Mirror\ub77c\ub294 AI \uc9c0\uc6d0 \uc724\ub9ac \uac80\ud1a0 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud604\ub300 \uc5f0\uad6c \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4\uc758 \uae30\ucd08 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc778 \uc724\ub9ac \uac80\ud1a0\uac00 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uacfc\ud559 \uc2e4\ucc9c\uc758 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uacb0\uacfc\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uc724\ub9ac\uc801 \uc704\ud5d8\uc758 \uc99d\uac00\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ud070 \uc555\ubc15\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "Mirror\ub294 \uc724\ub9ac\uc801 \ucd94\ub860, \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uaddc\uce59 \ud574\uc11d \ubc0f \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2ec\uc758\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c AI \uc9c0\uc6d0 \uc724\ub9ac \uac80\ud1a0 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, EthicsLLM\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uae30\uc900 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "Mirror\uc758 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubaa8\ub4dc\ub294 \uc2e0\uc18d \uac80\ud1a0\uc640 \uc704\uc6d0\ud68c \uac80\ud1a0\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uc5ec \uc724\ub9ac \ud3c9\uac00\uc758 \ud488\uc9c8\uacfc \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uac1c\uc120\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Mirror\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18ist LLM\ub4e4\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud588\uc744 \ub54c \uc724\ub9ac \ud3c9\uac00\uc758 \uc9c8, \uc77c\uad00\uc131 \ubc0f \uc804\ubb38\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc724\ub9ac \uac80\ud1a0\ub294 \ud604\ub300 \uc5f0\uad6c \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4\uc758 \uae30\ucd08\uc801\uc778 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud604\ub300 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub2e4\ud559\uc81c \uacfc\ud559 \uc2e4\ucc9c\uc758 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uacb0\uacfc\ub85c \uc724\ub9ac\uc801 \uc704\ud5d8\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ud070 \uc555\ubc15\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc704\ud5d8 \ud504\ub85c\ud544 \uc544\ub798\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uace0 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc724\ub9ac \uac10\ub3c5\uc758 \uc815\ub2f9\uc131\uc774 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uae30\uad00 \uac80\ud1a0 \ub2a5\ub825\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \uc724\ub9ac \uac80\ud1a0\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud560 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uae30\ud68c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uadf8 \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc778 \uc801\uc6a9\uc740 \uc724\ub9ac\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825 \ubd80\uc871, \uaddc\uc81c \uad6c\uc870\uc640\uc758 \uc57d\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569 \ubc0f \uc9c4\uc815\ud55c \uac80\ud1a0 \uc790\ub8cc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \uc81c\ud55c\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc81c\ud55c\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc724\ub9ac\uc801 \ucd94\ub860, \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uaddc\uce59 \ud574\uc11d \ubc0f \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2ec\uc758\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c AI \uc9c0\uc6d0 \uc724\ub9ac \uac80\ud1a0\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Mirror\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8 \ud575\uc2ec\uc740 \uad8c\uc704 \uc788\ub294 \uc724\ub9ac \ubc0f \uaddc\uc81c \ucf54\ud37c\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc99d\ub958\ub41c 41K \uc9c8\ubb38-\uc0ac\uace0-\ub2f5\ubcc0 \uc0bc\uc911\uccb4\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \ud2b9\uc218 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc778 EthicsQA\uc5d0\uc11c \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ub41c \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\uc778 EthicsLLM\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Meanwhile, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and corresponding agentic paradigms have made rapid progress in supporting various workflows, but it remains unclear whether they can reliably generate decision-making deliverables from operational service products (e.g., actionable signal comprehension, decision-making handoff, and decision analysis & planning) under uncertainty. We introduce S2SServiceBench, a multimodal benchmark for last-mile S2S climate services curated from an operational climate-service system to evaluate this capability. S2SServiceBenchcovers 10 service products with about 150+ expert-selected cases in total, spanning six application domains - Agriculture, Disasters, Energy, Finance, Health, and Shipping. Each case is instantiated at three service levels, yielding around 500 tasks and 1,000+ evaluation items across climate resilience and sustainability applications. Using S2SServiceBench, we benchmark state-of-the-art MLLMs and agents, and analyze performance across products and service levels, revealing persistent challenges in S2S service plot understanding and reasoning - namely, actionable signal comprehension, operationalizing uncertainty into executable handoffs, and stable, evidence-grounded analysis and planning for dynamic hazards-while offering actionable guidance for building future climate-service agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "S2SForecasts\ub294 \uae30\ud6c4 \ud68c\ubcf5\ub825 \ubc0f \uc9c0\uc18d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uacc4\ud68d \ucc3d\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud589\ub3d9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uae30\ud6c4 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub294 \ub370\uc5d0\ub294 '\ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9 \ub9c8\uc77c \uac2d'\uc774 \uc874\uc7ac\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 S2SServiceBench\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uc81c\ud488\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\uc810\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\ud6c4 \ud68c\ubcf5\ub825 \ubc0f \uc9c0\uc18d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc8fc\ucc28\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6d4\uac04 \uacc4\ud68d \ucc3d\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 S2S \uc608\uce21\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uae30\ud6c4 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\ub85c \uc804\ud658\ud558\ub294 \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9 \ub9c8\uc77c \uac2d\uc774 \uc874\uc7ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "S2SServiceBench\ub77c\ub294 \ud504\ub85c\uc81d\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uc81c\ud488\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uc218\ub9bd\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "S2SServiceBench\ub294 10\uac1c\uc758 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uc81c\ud488\uacfc 150\uac1c \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc120\uc815 \uc0ac\ub840\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub4e4 \uac01\uac01\uc740 3\uac1c\uc758 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \ub808\ubca8\uc5d0\uc11c \uad6c\uccb4\ud654\ub418\uc5b4 \uc57d 500\uac1c\uc758 \uc791\uc5c5 \ubc0f 1,000\uac1c \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00 \ud56d\ubaa9\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uae30\ud6c4 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uad6c\ucd95\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc9c0\uce68\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba74\uc11c, S2S \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uc774\ud574 \ubc0f \ucd94\ub860\uc758 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ubb38\uc81c\uc810\uc774 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0ac\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud558\uc704 \uacc4\uc808-\uacc4\uc808(S2S) \uc608\uce21\uc740 \uae30\ud6c4 \ud68c\ubcf5\ub825 \ubc0f \uc9c0\uc18d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uacb0\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc8fc-\uac1c\uc6d4 \uacc4\ud68d \ucc3d\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uace0 \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uae30\ud6c4 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub294 \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9 \ub9c8\uc77c \uac2d\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \uc774\ud574\uc640 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud55c\ud3b8, \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(MLLM)\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc2e0\uc18d\ud55c \uc9c4\uc804\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub4e4\uc774 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b4\uc601 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uc81c\ud488(\uc608: \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc2e0\ud638 \uc774\ud574, \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \uc774\uad00 \ubc0f \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \ubd84\uc11d \ubc0f \uacc4\ud68d)\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub294 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud558\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b4\uc601 \uae30\ud6c4 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc120\ubcc4\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc778 S2SServiceBench\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.

However, in the real world, the number of agents is neither fixed nor known a priori. Moreover, an agent can decide to create other agents (for example, a cell may divide, or a company may spin off a division). In this paper, we propose a framework that allows agents to create other agents; we call this a fluid-agent environment. We present game-theoretic solution concepts for fluid-agent games and empirically evaluate the performance of several MARL algorithms within this framework. Our experiments include fluid variants of established benchmarks such as Predator-Prey and Level-Based Foraging, where agents can dynamically spawn, as well as a new environment we introduce that highlights how fluidity can unlock novel solution strategies beyond those observed in fixed-population settings.

It demands faithful content selection, coherent slide organization, layout-aware rendering, and robust multi-turn instruction following. However, existing benchmarks and evaluation protocols do not adequately measure these challenges. To address this gap, we introduce the Deck Edits and Compliance Kit Benchmark (DECKBench), an evaluation framework for multi-agent slide generation and editing. DECKBench is built on a curated dataset of paper to slide pairs augmented with realistic, simulated editing instructions. Our evaluation protocol systematically assesses slide-level and deck-level fidelity, coherence, layout quality, and multi-turn instruction following. We further implement a modular multi-agent baseline system that decomposes the slide generation and editing task into paper parsing and summarization, slide planning, HTML creation, and iterative editing. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed benchmark highlights strengths, exposes failure modes, and provides actionable insights for improving multi-agent slide generation and editing systems. Overall, this work establishes a standardized foundation for reproducible and comparable evaluation of academic presentation generation and editing.

In this work, we introduce EIDOS, a foundation model family that shifts pretraining from future value prediction to latent-space predictive learning. We train a causal Transformer to predict the evolution of latent representations, encouraging the emergence of structured and temporally coherent latent states. To ensure stable targets for latent-space learning, we design a lightweight aggregation branch to construct target representations. EIDOS is optimized via a joint objective that integrates latent-space alignment, observational grounding to anchor representations to the input signal, and direct forecasting supervision. On the GIFT-Eval benchmark, EIDOS mitigates structural fragmentation in the representation space and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

We introduce the first theoretical framework for analyzing error accumulation in Model Context Protocol (MCP) agents, proving that cumulative distortion exhibits linear growth and high-probability deviations bounded by $O(\\sqrt{T})$. This concentration property ensures predictable system behavior and rules out exponential failure modes. We develop a hybrid distortion metric combining discrete fact matching with continuous semantic similarity, then establish martingale concentration bounds on error propagation through sequential tool interactions. Experiments across Qwen2-7B, Llama-3-8B, and Mistral-7B validate our theoretical predictions, showing empirical distortion tracks the linear trend with deviations consistently within $O(\\sqrt{T})$ envelopes. Key findings include: semantic weighting reduces distortion by 80\\%, and periodic re-grounding approximately every 9 steps suffices for error control.

In real-world deployments, forecasting models must operate under structural and observational uncertainties, conditions that are rarely considered in model design. Recent approaches achieve strong short-term predictive performance by tightly coupling spatial and temporal modeling, often at the cost of increased complexity and limited modularity. In contrast, efficient time-series models capture long-range temporal dependencies without relying on explicit network structure. We propose UniST-Pred, a unified spatio-temporal forecasting framework that first decouples temporal modeling from spatial representation learning, then integrates both through adaptive representation-level fusion. To assess robustness of the proposed approach, we construct a dataset based on an agent-based, microscopic traffic simulator (MATSim) and evaluate UniST-Pred under severe network disconnection scenarios. Additionally, we benchmark UniST-Pred on standard traffic prediction datasets, demonstrating its competitive performance against existing well-established models despite a lightweight design. The results illustrate that UniST-Pred maintains strong predictive performance across both real-world and simulated datasets, while also yielding interpretable spatio-temporal representations under infrastructure disruptions.

Alison Noble"], "title": "Picking the Right Specialist: Attentive Neural Process-based Selection of Task-Specialized Models as Tools for Agentic Healthcare Systems", "comment": null, "summary": "Task-specialized models form the backbone of agentic healthcare systems, enabling the agents to answer clinical queries across tasks such as disease diagnosis, localization, and report generation. Yet, for a given task, a single \"best\" model rarely exists. In practice, each task is better served by multiple competing specialist models where different models excel on different data samples. As a result, for any given query, agents must reliably select the right specialist model from a heterogeneous pool of tool candidates. To this end, we introduce ToolSelect, which adaptively learns model selection for tools by minimizing a population risk over sampled specialist tool candidates using a consistent surrogate of the task-conditional selection loss. Concretely, we propose an Attentive Neural Process-based selector conditioned on the query and per-model behavioral summaries to choose among the specialist models. Motivated by the absence of any established testbed, we, for the first time, introduce an agentic Chest X-ray environment equipped with a diverse suite of task-specialized models (17 disease detection, 19 report generation, 6 visual grounding, and 13 VQA) and develop ToolSelectBench, a benchmark of 1448 queries. Our results demonstrate that ToolSelect consistently outperforms 10 SOTA methods across four different task families.", "AI": {"tldr": "ToolSelect\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc804\ubb38 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc911\uc5d0\uc11c \uc801\uc808\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uac1c\ubc1c\ub41c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc73c\ub85c, 1448\uac1c\uc758 \ucffc\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 10\uac1c\uc758 \ucd5c\uc2e0 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e8\uc77c '\ucd5c\uace0' \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uac70\uc758 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0, \uac01 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uacbd\uc7c1\ud558\ub294 \uc804\ubb38 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "ToolSelect\ub294 \ucffc\ub9ac\uc640 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc694\uc57d\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc804\ubb38 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc8fc\uc758 \uae30\ubc18 \uc2e0\uacbd \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "ToolSelect\ub294 4\uac1c\uc758 \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \uc791\uc5c5\uad70\uc5d0\uc11c 10\uac1c\uc758 \ucd5c\uc2e0 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "ToolSelect\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc804\ubb38 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc784\uc0c1 \ucffc\ub9ac \uc751\ub2f5\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\ub294 \ub370 \uae30\uc5ec\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc791\uc5c5 \uc804\ubb38\ud654\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc758\ub8cc \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc911\ucd94\ub97c \ud615\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc9c8\ubcd1 \uc9c4\ub2e8, \uc704\uce58 \ucd94\uc801 \ubc0f \ubcf4\uace0\uc11c \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5 \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc784\uc0c1 \ucffc\ub9ac\uc5d0 \uc751\ub2f5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc8fc\uc5b4\uc9c4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 '\ucd5c\uace0' \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uac70\uc758 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\uc81c\ub85c \uac01 \uc791\uc5c5\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud558\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uacbd\uc7c1 \uc804\ubb38 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c \ub354 \uc798 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacb0\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \ud2b9\uc815 \ucffc\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uad6c \ud6c4\ubcf4 \ud480\uc5d0\uc11c \uc62c\ubc14\ub978 \uc804\ubb38 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uc788\uac8c \uc120\ud0dd\ud574\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 ToolSelect\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc870\uac74 \uc120\ud0dd \uc190\uc2e4\uc758 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \ub300\ub9ac \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\ub41c \uc804\ubb38 \ub3c4\uad6c \ud6c4\ubcf4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc9d1\ub2e8 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378 \uc120\ud0dd\uc744 \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ucffc\ub9ac \ubc0f \ubaa8\ub378\ubcc4 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc694\uc57d\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc804\ubb38 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc911\uc5d0\uc11c \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc8fc\uc758 \uc2e0\uacbd \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \uae30\ubc18 \uc120\ud0dd\uae30\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud655\ub9bd\ub41c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ubca0\ub4dc\uac00 \uc5c6\ub2e4\ub294 \ub3d9\uae30\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5 \uc804\ubb38\ud654\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378(17\uac1c \uc9c8\ubcd1 \ud0d0\uc9c0, 19\uac1c \ubcf4\uace0\uc11c \uc0dd\uc131, 6\uac1c \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \uae30\ucd08 \ubc0f 13\uac1c VQA)\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ud749\ubd80 X\uc120 \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \ucc98\uc74c\uc73c\ub85c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0 1448\uac1c\uc758 \ucffc\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc778 ToolSelectBench\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 ToolSelect\uac00 4\uac1c\uc758 \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \uc791\uc5c5\uad70\uc5d0\uc11c 10\uac1c\uc758 \ucd5c\uc2e0 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Prior work has defined a mechanism for Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agents to be able to answer questions of the form ``why did you do action $X$?''. However, we know that we ask \\emph{contrastive} questions (``why did you do $X$ \\emph{instead of} $F$?''). We therefore extend previous work to be able to answer such questions. A computational evaluation shows that using contrastive questions yields a significant reduction in explanation length. A human subject evaluation was conducted to assess whether such contrastive answers are preferred, and how well they support trust development and transparency. We found some evidence for contrastive answers being preferred, and some evidence that they led to higher trust, perceived understanding, and confidence in the system's correctness. We also evaluated the benefit of providing explanations at all. Surprisingly, there was not a clear benefit, and in some situations we found evidence that providing a (full) explanation was worse than not providing any explanation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc790\uc728 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \ubc18\ub300 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc5d0 \ub2f5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e0\ub8b0 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uace0 \ud22c\uba85\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc790\uc728 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc124\uba85 \uc81c\uacf5 \ub2a5\ub825\uc740 \ud22c\uba85\uc131\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uace0 \uc801\uc808\ud55c \uc2e0\ub8b0 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc5d0 \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc774 \ub418\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uae30\uc874 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 '\uc65c \ud589\ub3d9 $X$\ub97c \ud588\ub098\uc694?'\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc5d0 \ub2f5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc815\uc758\ud55c \uac83\uc744 \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uc5ec '\uc65c $X$ \ub300\uc2e0 $F$\ub97c \ud588\ub098\uc694?'\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ubc18\ub300 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc5d0 \ub2f5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uacc4\uc0b0 \ud3c9\uac00 \uacb0\uacfc, \ubc18\ub300 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uba74 \uc124\uba85 \uae38\uc774\uac00 \ud06c\uac8c \uc904\uc5b4\ub4e4\uace0, \uc0ac\ub78c\uc774 \uc8fc\uad00\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc \ubc18\ub300 \ub2f5\ubcc0\uc774 \uc120\ud638\ub418\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uacfc \uc2e0\ub8b0, \uc774\ud574\ub3c4 \ubc0f \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud655\uc2e0\uc774 \ub192\uc544\uc9c0\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \ubc1c\uacac\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc758 \uc774\uc810\uc740 \uba85\ud655\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uc73c\uba70, \uc77c\ubd80 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 (\uc804\uccb4) \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \uac83\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub098\uc058\ub2e4\ub294 \uc99d\uac70\uac00 \ubc1c\uacac\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc790\uc728 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc740 \ud22c\uba85\uc131\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uace0 (\uc801\uc808\ud55c) \uc2e0\ub8b0 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc5d0 \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc774 \ub418\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc694\uc18c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uc804 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc2e0\ub150-\uc695\uad6c-\uc758\ub3c4(BDI) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \u201c\uc65c \ud589\ub3d9 $X$\ub97c \ud588\ub098\uc694?\u201d\ub77c\ub294 \ud615\ud0dc\uc758 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc5d0 \ub2f5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc815\uc758\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 '\ub300\ube44' \uc9c8\ubb38(\u201c\uc65c $X$ \ub300\uc2e0\uc5d0 $F$\ub97c \ud588\ub098\uc694?\u201d)\uc744 \ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc54c\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\uc804 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc9c8\ubb38\uc5d0 \ub2f5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacc4\uc0b0 \ud3c9\uac00 \uacb0\uacfc, \ub300\ube44 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc124\uba85 \uae38\uc774\ub97c \ud06c\uac8c \uc904\uc774\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc778\uac04 \ud53c\ud5d8\uc790 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub300\ube44 \ub2f5\ubcc0\uc774 \uc120\ud638\ub418\ub294\uc9c0, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc2e0\ub8b0 \uac1c\ubc1c\uacfc \ud22c\uba85\uc131\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294\uc9c0 \ud3c9\uac00\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub300\ube44 \ub2f5\ubcc0\uc774 \uc120\ud638\ub41c\ub2e4\ub294 \uc77c\ubd80 \uc99d\uac70\uc640 \uc2e0\ub8b0, \uc774\ud574\ub3c4 \ubc0f \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud655\uc2e0\uc774 \ub192\uc544\uc9c0\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc758 \uc774\uc810\ub3c4 \ud3c9\uac00\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub180\ub78d\uac8c\ub3c4 \uba85\ud655\ud55c \uc774\uc810\uc774 \uc5c6\uc5c8\uace0, \uc77c\ubd80 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 (\uc804\uccb4) \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc544\ubb34 \uc124\uba85\ub3c4 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \uac83\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub098\uc058\ub2e4\ub294 \uc99d\uac70\ub3c4 \ubc1c\uacac\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, these energy-intensive operations often rapidly deplete limited device batteries, reducing their operational lifetime and degrading the learning performance. To address this limitation, we apply energy harvesting technique to DFL systems, allowing edge devices to extract ambient energy and operate sustainably. We first derive the convergence bound for wireless DFL with energy harvesting, showing that the convergence is influenced by partial device participation and transmission packet drops, both of which further depend on the available energy supply. To accelerate convergence, we formulate a joint device scheduling and power control problem and model it as a multi-agent Markov decision process (MDP). Traditional MDP algorithms (e.g., value or policy iteration) require a centralized coordinator with access to all device states and exhibit exponential complexity in the number of devices, making them impractical for large-scale decentralized networks. To overcome these challenges, we propose a fully decentralized policy iteration algorithm that leverages only local state information from two-hop neighboring devices, thereby substantially reducing both communication overhead and computational complexity. We further provide a theoretical analysis showing that the proposed decentralized algorithm achieves asymptotic optimality. Finally, comprehensive numerical experiments on real-world datasets are conducted to validate the theoretical results and corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.", "AI": {"tldr":

To the best of our knowledge, it is the first open-source small language model (SLM) to achieve such versatility in a single model. To improve reasoning and preference alignment, we combine point-wise and pair-wise reward modeling, ensuring high-quality, human-aligned responses. For code generation, we design complexity-aware rewards in Reinforcement Learning, optimizing both correctness and efficiency. In deep search, we perform complex data synthesis and incorporate turn-level supervision during training. This enables stable long-horizon tool interactions, allowing Nanbeige4.1-3B to reliably execute up to 600 tool-call turns for complex problem-solving. Extensive experimental results show that Nanbeige4.1-3B significantly outperforms prior models of similar scale, such as Nanbeige4-3B-2511 and Qwen3-4B, even achieving superior performance compared to much larger models, such as Qwen3-30B-A3B.

While architectural solutions like DeepSeekMoE promote specialization, they require substantial structural modifications and rely solely on intra-layer signals. In this paper, we propose two plug-and-play regularization losses that enhance MoE specialization and routing efficiency without modifying router or model architectures. First, an intra-layer specialization loss penalizes cosine similarity between experts' SwiGLU activations on identical tokens, encouraging experts to specialize in complementary knowledge. Second, a cross-layer coupling loss maximizes joint Top-$k$ routing probabilities across adjacent layers, establishing coherent expert pathways through network depth while reinforcing intra-layer expert specialization.

As agents increasingly process untrusted data from emails, documents, tool outputs, and external APIs, robust attack detection becomes essential. Yet current evaluation practices and production systems have fundamental limitations. We present a comprehensive analysis using a diverse benchmark of 18 datasets spanning harmful requests, jailbreaks, indirect prompt injections, and extraction attacks. We propose Leave-One-Dataset-Out (LODO) evaluation to measure true out-of-distribution generalization, revealing that the standard practice of train-test splits from the same dataset sources severely overestimates performance: aggregate metrics show an 8.4 percentage point AUC inflation, but per-dataset gaps range from 1% to 25% accuracy-exposing heterogeneous failure modes. To understand why classifiers fail to generalize, we analyze Sparse Auto-Encoder (SAE) feature coefficients across LODO folds, finding that 28% of top features are dataset-dependent shortcuts whose class signal depends on specific dataset compositions rather than semantic content. We systematically compare production guardrails (PromptGuard 2, LlamaGuard) and LLM-as-judge approaches on our benchmark, finding all three fail on indirect attacks targeting agents (7-37% detection) and that PromptGuard 2 and LlamaGuard cannot evaluate agentic tool injection due to architectural limitations. Finally, we show that LODO-stable SAE features provide more reliable explanations for classifier decisions by filtering dataset artifacts.

These factors incur prohibitive computational costs, thereby impeding deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments. Conversely, general-purpose automated machine learning frameworks are often ill-suited for this domain, as exploration within an unbounded programmatic space fails to incorporate essential neurophysiological priors and frequently yields solutions that lack scientific plausibility. To address these limitations, we propose NeuroWeaver, a unified autonomous evolutionary agent designed to generalize across diverse EEG datasets and tasks by reformulating pipeline engineering as a discrete constrained optimization problem. Specifically, we employ a Domain-Informed Subspace Initialization to confine the search to neuroscientifically plausible manifolds, coupled with a Multi-Objective Evolutionary Optimization that dynamically balances performance, novelty, and efficiency via self-reflective refinement. Empirical evaluations across five heterogeneous benchmarks demonstrate that NeuroWeaver synthesizes lightweight solutions that consistently outperform state-of-the-art task-specific methods and achieve performance comparable to large-scale foundation models, despite utilizing significantly fewer parameters.", "AI": {"tldr": "NeuroWeaver\ub294 EEG \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uacbd\ub7c9 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uc774 EEG \ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0 \uc801\ud569\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uc774\uc720\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc694\uad6c\uc0ac\ud56d\uc774 \ud06c\uace0 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub192\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "NeuroWeaver\ub294 EEG \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uacfc \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uacf5\ud559\uc744 \uc774\uc0b0 \uc81c\uc57d \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Each agent is a machine learning (ML)-based detector that produces a normalized anomaly score, confidence, and structured evidence, augmented by a large language model (LLM)-based critic. A coordinator converts these messages into bounded per-agent losses and updates agent influence via an exponentiated-gradient rule, yielding both a final debated anomaly score and an auditable debate trace. MAD is a unified agentic framework that can recover existing approaches, such as mixture-of-experts gating and learning-with-expert-advice aggregation, by restricting the message space and synthesis operator. We establish regret guarantees for the synthesized losses and show how conformal calibration can wrap the debated score to control false positives under exchangeability. Experiments on diverse tabular anomaly benchmarks show improved robustness over baselines and clearer traces of model disagreement", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378 \uac04\uc758 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub97c \uc2e0\ud638\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud14c\uc774\ube14\ud615 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud1a0\ub860 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c MAD\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud14c\uc774\ube14\ud615 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc740 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc9d1\ud569\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uae30\ub294 \ub2e8\uc77c \ubaa8\ud615\uc774\ub098 \uc815\uc801 \uc559\uc0c1\ube14\ub85c \ucc98\ub9ac\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "MAD\ub294 \uac01 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc815\uaddc\ud654\ub41c \uc774\uc0c1 \uc810\uc218, \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub3c4 \ubc0f \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc99d\uac70\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "MAD\ub294 \ucd5c\uc885\uc801\uc778 \ud1a0\ub860\ub41c \uc774\uc0c1 \uc810\uc218\uc640 \uac10\uc0ac \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud1a0\ub860 \ud754\uc801\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uba70, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud14c\uc774\ube14\ud615 \uc774\uc0c1 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub41c \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "MAD\ub294 \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0 \uacf5\uac04\uacfc \ud569\uc131 \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc790\ub97c \uc81c\ud55c\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\ub4e4\uc744 \ubcf5\uad6c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569\uc801\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud14c\uc774\ube14\ud615 \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e8\uc77c \ud0d0\uc9c0\uae30 \ub610\ub294 \uc815\uc801 \uc559\uc0c1\ube14\ub85c \ucc98\ub9ac\ub418\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud14c\uc774\ube14 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \ubd84\ud3ec \ubcc0\ud654, \uacb0\uce21 \ubc0f \ub4dc\ubb38 \uc774\uc0c1 \uc601\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uc8fc \ub2ec\ub77c\uc9c0\ub294 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801 \ubaa8\ub378 \uacc4\uc5f4(\uc608: \ud2b8\ub9ac \uc559\uc0c1\ube14, \uc2ec\uce35 \ud14c\uc774\ube14 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ubc0f \ud14c\uc774\ube14 \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378)\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub97c 1\uae09 \uc2e0\ud638\ub85c \uac04\uc8fc\ud558\uace0 \uc218\ud559\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uae30\ubc18\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uc870\uc815 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud1a0\ub860 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c MAD\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac01 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc815\uaddc\ud654\ub41c \uc774\uc0c1 \uc810\uc218, \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub3c4 \ubc0f \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc99d\uac70\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5(ML) \uae30\ubc18 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uae30\uc774\uba70, \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uae30\ubc18 \ube44\ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ubcf4\uac15\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc870\uc815\uc790\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0\ub97c \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub2f9 \uc190\uc2e4\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\uace0 \uc9c0\uc218\ud654 \uacbd\ub7c9 \uaddc\uce59\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ud558\uc5ec \ucd5c\uc885 \ud1a0\ub860\ub41c \uc774\uc0c1 \uc810\uc218\uc640 \uac10\uc0ac \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud1a0\ub860 \ud754\uc801\uc744 \uc0b0\ucd9c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Prior work has examined the safety and misuse risks associated with agents. However, much of this has focused on the single-agent case and/or setups missing basic engineering safeguards such as access control, revealing a scarcity of threat modeling in multi-agent systems. We investigate the security vulnerabilities of a popular multi-agent pattern known as the orchestrator setup, in which a central agent decomposes and delegates tasks to specialized agents. Through red-teaming a concrete setup representative of a likely future use case, we demonstrate a novel attack vector, OMNI-LEAK, that compromises several agents to leak sensitive data through a single indirect prompt injection, even in the \\textit{presence of data access control}. We report the susceptibility of frontier models to different categories of attacks, finding that both reasoning and non-reasoning models are vulnerable, even when the attacker lacks insider knowledge of the implementation details. Our work highlights the importance of safety research to generalize from single-agent to multi-agent settings, in order to reduce the serious risks of real-world privacy breaches and financial losses

Although large language models enable adaptive, multi-turn interactions in natural language, most existing elicitation methods optimize what to ask with a fixed respondent pool, and do not adapt respondent selection or leverage population structure when responses are partial or incomplete. To address this gap, we study adaptive group elicitation, a multi-round setting where an agent adaptively selects both questions and respondents under explicit query and participation budgets. We propose a theoretically grounded framework that combines (i) an LLM-based expected information gain objective for scoring candidate questions with (ii) heterogeneous graph neural network propagation that aggregates observed responses and participant attributes to impute missing responses and guide per-round respondent selection. This closed-loop procedure queries a small, informative subset of individuals while inferring population-level responses via structured similarity. Across three real-world opinion datasets, our method consistently improves population-level response prediction under constrained budgets, including a >12% relative gain on CES at a 10% respondent budget.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc9c8\ubb38 \ub178\ub825\uc73c\ub85c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc9d1\ub2e8 \uc720\ub3c4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc608\uc0b0 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c8\ubb38\uacfc \uc751\ub2f5\uc790\ub97c \uc120\ud0dd\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc870\uc0ac \ubc0f \uc9d1\ub2e8 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801\uc778 \uc9d1\ub2e8 \uc218\uc900 \ud2b9\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc9c8\ubb38 \ub178\ub825\uc744 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubc30\ubd84\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc608\uc0c1 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc774\ub4dd \ubaa9\ud45c\uc640 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \uc804\ud30c\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc138 \uac1c\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc124\ubb38 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c, \ubcf8 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc608\uc0b0 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9d1\ub2e8 \uc218\uc900 \uc751\ub2f5 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc751\ub2f5\uc790 \uc608\uc0b0 10%\uc5d0\uc11c CES\uc758 12% \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uc0c1\ub300\uc801 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uc5ec, \uc6b0\ub9ac \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uc9d1\ub2e8 \uc218\uc900 \uc751\ub2f5 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc124\ubb38 \uc870\uc0ac \ubc0f \uae30\ud0c0 \uc9d1\ub2e8 \ud3c9\uac00\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801\uc778 \uc9d1\ub2e8 \uc218\uc900 \ud2b9\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \ube44\uc6a9\uacfc \ub204\ub77d\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc9c8\ubb38 \ub178\ub825\uc744 \ubc30\ubd84\ud574\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ub2e4\ud68c\uc804 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc720\ub3c4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uace0\uc815\ub41c \uc751\ub2f5\uc790 \ud480\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubb34\uc5c7\uc744 \ubb3b\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uba70, \uc751\ub2f5\uc774 \ubd80\ubd84\uc801\uc774\uac70\ub098 \ubd88\uc644\uc804\ud560 \ub54c \uc751\ub2f5\uc790 \uc120\ud0dd\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc9d1\ub2e8 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uc18c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc778 \ucffc\ub9ac \ubc0f \ucc38\uc5ec \uc608\uc0b0 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c8\ubb38\uacfc \uc751\ub2f5\uc790\ub97c \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\ud68c\uc804 \uc124\uc815\uc778 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc9d1\ub2e8 \uc720\ub3c4\ub97c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud6c4\ubcf4 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc758 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \ub9e4\uae30\uae30 \uc704\ud55c LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uae30\ub300 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc774\ub4dd \ubaa9\ud45c\uc640 \uad00\ucc30\ub41c \uc751\ub2f5 \ubc0f \ucc38\uc5ec\uc790 \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \uc9d1\uacc4\ud558\uc5ec \ub204\ub77d\ub41c \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \ubcf4\uac04\ud558\uace0 \uac01 \ud68c\ucc28 \uc751\ub2f5\uc790 \uc120\ud0dd\uc744 \uc548\ub0b4\ud558\ub294 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \uc804\ud30c\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uae30\ubc18\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud3d0\uc1c4 \ub8e8\ud504 \uc808\ucc28\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc9d1\ub2e8 \uc218\uc900 \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \ucd94\ub860\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc18c\uaddc\ubaa8\uc758 \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c \uac1c\uccb4 \uc9d1\ud569\uc5d0 \uc9c8\uc758\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc138 \uac1c\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc758\uacac \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc608\uc0b0 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9d1\ub2e8 \uc218\uc900 \uc751\ub2f5 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uba70, \uc751\ub2f5\uc790 \uc608\uc0b0\uc774 10%\uc77c \ub54c CES\uc5d0\uc11c 12% \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uc0c1\ub300\uc801\uc778 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Unlike standard LLMs answering questions in a controlled ChatBot setting, web agents act \"in the wild\", interacting with third parties and leaving behind an action trace. Therefore, we ask the question: how do web agents handle user resources when accomplishing tasks on their behalf across live websites? In this paper, we formalize Natural Agentic Oversharing -- the unintentional disclosure of task-irrelevant user information through an agent trace of actions on the web. We introduce SPILLage, a framework that characterizes oversharing along two dimensions: channel (content vs. behavior) and directness (explicit vs. implicit). This taxonomy reveals a critical blind spot: while prior work focuses on text leakage, web agents also overshare behaviorally through clicks, scrolls, and navigation patterns that can be monitored. We benchmark 180 tasks on live e-commerce sites with ground-truth annotations separating task-relevant from task-irrelevant attributes. Across 1,080 runs spanning two agentic frameworks and three backbone LLMs, we demonstrate that oversharing is pervasive with behavioral oversharing dominates content oversharing by 5x. This effect persists -- and can even worsen -- under prompt-level mitigation. However, removing task-irrelevant information before execution improves task success by up to 17.9%, demonstrating that reducing oversharing improves task success. Our findings underscore that protecting privacy in web agents is a fundamental challenge, requiring a broader view of \"output\" that accounts for what agents do on the web, not just what they type.

Traditional compilers are constrained by fixed heuristics, whereas finetuning Large Language Models (LLMs) can be expensive. However, agentic workflows for CUDA code optimization have limited ability to aggregate knowledge from prior exploration, leading to biased sampling and suboptimal solutions. We propose KernelBlaster, a Memory-Augmented In-context Reinforcement Learning (MAIC-RL) framework designed to improve CUDA optimization search capabilities of LLM-based GPU coding agents. KernelBlaster enables agents to learn from experience and make systematically informed decisions on future tasks by accumulating knowledge into a retrievable Persistent CUDA Knowledge Base. We propose a novel profile-guided, textual-gradient-based agentic flow for CUDA generation and optimization to achieve high performance across generations of GPU architectures. KernelBlaster guides LLM agents to systematically explore high-potential optimization strategies beyond naive rewrites. Compared to the PyTorch baseline, our method achieves geometric mean speedups of 1.43x, 2.50x, and 1.50x on KernelBench Levels 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

In contrast, memory in language agents remains mainly semantic, and current agents are not yet capable of effectively recollecting and reasoning over interaction histories. We identify and formalize the core challenges of episodic recollection and reasoning from this gap, and observe that existing work often overlooks episodicity, lacks explicit event modeling, or overemphasizes simple retrieval rather than complex reasoning. We present REMem, a two-phase framework for constructing and reasoning with episodic memory: 1) Offline indexing, where REMem converts experiences into a hybrid memory graph that flexibly links time-aware gists and facts. 2) Online inference, where REMem employs an agentic retriever with carefully curated tools for iterative retrieval over the memory graph. Comprehensive evaluation across four episodic memory benchmarks shows that REMem substantially outperforms state-of-the-art memory systems such as Mem0 and HippoRAG 2, showing 3.4% and 13.4% absolute improvements on episodic recollection and reasoning tasks, respectively. Moreover, REMem also demonstrates more robust refusal behavior for unanswerable questions.", "AI": {"tldr": "REMem \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc5d0\ud53c\uc18c\ub4dc \uae30\uc5b5\uc744

This allows an orchestrating agent to invoke quantitative predictions when needed and reason about their outputs in context. Unlike conventional pipelines that treat ML inference as a static preprocessing step, MLAT positions the model as a first-class tool alongside web search, database queries, and APIs, enabling the LLM to decide when and how to use it based on conversational context.\n  To validate MLAT, we present PitchCraft, a pilot production system that converts discovery call recordings into professional proposals with ML-predicted pricing. The system uses two agents: a Research Agent that gathers prospect intelligence via parallel tool calls, and a Draft Agent that invokes an XGBoost pricing model as a tool call and generates a complete proposal through structured outputs. The pricing model, trained on 70 examples combining real and human-verified synthetic data, achieves R^2 = 0.807 on held-out data with a mean absolute error of 3688 USD. The system reduces proposal generation time from multiple hours to under 10 minutes.\n  We describe the MLAT framework, structured output architecture, training methodology under extreme data scarcity, and sensitivity analysis demonstrating meaningful learned relationships. MLAT generalizes to domains requiring quantitative estimation combined with contextual reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "MLAT\ub294 \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ud638\ucd9c \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c\ub85c \ub178\ucd9c\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ub514\uc790\uc778 \ud328\ud134\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "MLAT\ub294 LLM\uc774 \ub300\ud654 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud638\ucd9c\ud558\uc5ec \ud65c\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\uc5ec \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc608\uce21\uacfc \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "PitchCraft\ub77c\ub294 \ud30c\uc77c\ub7ff \uc0dd\uc0b0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc18 \uac00\uaca9 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubc1c\uacac \uc804\ud654 \uae30\ub85d\uc744 \uc804\ubb38 \uc81c\uc548\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uac00\uaca9 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 70\uac1c\uc758 \uc608\uc81c\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ub418\uba70, \ubcf4\ub958\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c R^2 = 0.807\uacfc \ud3c9\uade0 \uc808\ub300 \uc624\ucc28 3688 USD\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "MLAT\ub294 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uacfc \ud568\uaed8 \uc815\ub7c9\uc801 \ucd94\uc815\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc9c0\ub2cc\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ud638\ucd9c \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub514\uc790\uc778 \ud328\ud134\uc778 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ub3c4\uad6c(MLAT)\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc870\uc815 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud560 \ub54c \uc815\ub7c9\uc801 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \ud638\ucd9c\ud558\uace0 \uadf8 \ucd9c\ub825\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd94\ub860\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc774 ML \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc815\uc801 \uc804\ucc98\ub9ac \ub2e8\uacc4\ub85c \ub2e4\ub8e8\ub294 \uac83\uacfc \ub2ec\ub9ac, MLAT\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc6f9 \uac80\uc0c9, \ub370\uc774\ud130\ubca0\uc774\uc2a4 \ucffc\ub9ac \ubc0f API\uc640 \uac19\uc740 1\uae09 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub85c \ubc30\uce58\ud558\uc5ec LLM\uc774 \ub300\ud654 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc5b8\uc81c \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560\uc9c0\ub97c \uacb0\uc815\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Conventional paradigms predominantly rely on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) using static datasets. However, these methods suffer from severe distributional shifts, as offline trajectories fail to capture the stochastic state transitions and real-time feedback of unconstrained wide web environments. In this paper, we propose a robust Online Reinforcement Learning WebAgent, designed to optimize its policy through direct, iterative interactions with unconstrained wide websites. Our approach comprises three core innovations: 1) Hierarchical Multi-Task Fine-tuning: We curate a comprehensive mixture of datasets categorized by functional primitives -- Planning, Acting, and Grounding -- establishing a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with strong instruction-following capabilities for Web GUI tasks. 2) Online Agentic RL in the Wild: We develop an online interaction environment and fine-tune the VLM using a specialized RL pipeline. We introduce a Hybrid Reward Mechanism that combines a ground-truth-agnostic WebJudge for holistic outcome assessment with a Rule-based Decision Tree (RDT) for progress reward. This system effectively mitigates the credit assignment challenge in long-horizon navigation. Notably, our RL-enhanced model achieves a 38.1\\% success rate (pass@5) on WebArena, outperforming all existing monolithic baselines. 3) Operator Agent: We introduce a modular agentic framework, namely \\textbf{OpAgent}, orchestrating a Planner, Grounder, Reflector, and Summarizer. This synergy enables robust error recovery and self-correction, elevating the agent's performance to a new State-of-the-Art (SOTA) success rate of \\textbf{71.6\\%}.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774

Human Experts Matter More Than Other LLMs", "comment": null, "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) increasingly operate in environments where they encounter social information such as other agents' answers, tool outputs, or human recommendations. In humans, such inputs influence judgments in ways that depend on the source's credibility and the strength of consensus. This paper investigates whether LLMs exhibit analogous patterns of influence and whether they privilege feedback from humans over feedback from other LLMs. Across three binary decision-making tasks, reading comprehension, multi-step reasoning, and moral judgment, we present four instruction-tuned LLMs with prior responses attributed either to friends, to human experts, or to other LLMs. We manipulate whether the group is correct and vary the group size. In a second experiment, we introduce direct disagreement between a single human and a single LLM. Across tasks, models conform significantly more to responses labeled as coming from human experts, including when that signal is incorrect, and revise their answers toward experts more readily than toward other LLMs. These results reveal that expert framing acts as a strong prior for contemporary LLMs, suggesting a form of credibility-sensitive social influence that generalizes across decision domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc774 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uc815\ubcf4\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubc1b\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uba70, \uc778\uac04 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 LLM \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc120\uc2dc\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc778\uac04\uc758 \ud310\ub2e8\uc774 \ub2e4\ub978 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ub2f5\ubcc0, \ub3c4\uad6c\uc758 \ucd9c\ub825, \uc778\uac04\uc758 \ucd94\ucc9c\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uc815\ubcf4\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubc1b\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc774\ud574\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud568\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc774\uc9c4 \uacb0\uc815-making \uacfc\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc9c0\uce68 \uc870\uc815 LLM\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uce5c\uad6c, \uc778\uac04 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \ub610\ub294 \ub2e4\ub978 LLM\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\ub798\ub41c \uc774\uc804 \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uace0, \uadf8\ub8f9\uc774 \uc815\ud655\ud55c\uc9c0 \uc870\uc791\ud558\uc5ec \uadf8\ub8f9 \ud06c\uae30\ub97c \ubcc0\ud654\uc2dc\ucf30\ub2e4.", "result": "\ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc5d0\uc11c \uc624\ub294 \uc751\ub2f5\uc5d0 \ub354 \uac15\ud558\uac8c conform\ud558\uba70, \uadf8 \uc2e0\ud638\uac00 \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \uacbd\uc6b0\uc5d0\ub3c4 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \ucabd\uc73c\ub85c \ub354 \uc27d\uac8c \ub2f5\ubcc0\uc744 \uc218\uc815\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc804\ubb38\uac00 \ud504\ub808\uc774\ubc0d\uc740 \ud604\ub300 LLM\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc774\uc804 \uc815\ubcf4\ub85c \uc791\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud310\ub2e8 \uc601\uc5ed \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub3c4 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub2e4\ub978 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ub2f5\ubcc0, \ub3c4\uad6c \ucd9c\ub825 \ub610\ub294 \uc778\uac04 \ucd94\ucc9c\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc811\ud558\ub294 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc778\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc785\ub825\uc774 \ucd9c\ucc98\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uacfc \ud569\uc758\uc758 \uac15\ub3c4\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ud310\ub2e8\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce69\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 LLM\uc774 \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\ub294\uc9c0, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 LLM\uc774 \ub2e4\ub978 LLM\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \uc6b0\uc120\uc2dc\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc774\uc9c4 \uacb0\uc815-making \uacfc\uc81c, \ub3c5\ud574\ub825, \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \ub3c4\ub355\uc801 \ud310\ub2e8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc9c0\uce68 \uc870\uc815 LLM\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uce5c\uad6c, \uc778\uac04 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \ub610\ub294 \ub2e4\ub978 LLM\uc5d0 \uadc0\uc18d\ub41c \uc774\uc804 \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uadf8\ub8f9\uc758 \uc815\ubc00\ub3c4\ub97c \uc870\uc791\ud558\uace0 \uadf8\ub8f9 \ud06c\uae30\ub97c \ubcc0\ud654\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub450 \ubc88\uc9f8 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc778\uac04\uacfc \ub2e8\uc77c LLM \uac04\uc758 \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc778 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc791\uc5c5 \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0, \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc778\uac04 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc5d0\uc11c \uc624\ub294 \uc751\ub2f5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc774 \uc21c\uc751\ud558\uba70, \ud574\ub2f9 \uc2e0\ud638\uac00 \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \uacbd\uc6b0\uc5d0\ub3c4 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \ucabd\uc73c\ub85c \ub354 \uc27d\uac8c \ub2f5\ubcc0\uc744 \uc218\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \ud504\ub808\uc774\ubc0d\uc774 \ud604\ub300 LLM\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc774\uc804 \uc815\ubcf4\ub85c \uc791\uc6a9\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ud310\ub2e8 \uc601\uc5ed \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub418\ub294 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub3c4 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Using the open source AeroBench F-16 simulation benchmark, we train a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent to regulate engine throttle and track commanded airspeed. The control objective is encoded as a Signal Temporal Logic (STL) requirement to maintain airspeed within a prescribed band during the final seconds of each maneuver. To enforce this specification at run time, we introduce a conformal STL shield that filters the RL agent's actions using online conformal prediction. We compare three settings: (i) PPO baseline, (ii) PPO with a classical rule-based STL shield, and (iii) PPO with the proposed conformal shield, under both nominal conditions and a severe stress scenario involving aerodynamic model mismatch, actuator rate limits, measurement noise, and mid-episode setpoint jumps. Experiments show that the conformal shield preserves STL satisfaction while maintaining near baseline performance and providing stronger robustness guarantees than the classical shield. These results demonstrate that combining formal specification monitoring with data driven RL control can substantially improve the reliability of autonomous flight control in challenging environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud615\uc2dd\uc801 \uc2dc\uac04 \ub17c\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc591\uc774 \ud56d\uacf5 \uc6b0\uc8fc \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0\uc11c

Inductive logic programming (ILP), a form of machine learning, induces rules from facts while maintaining interpretability. Differentiable ILP models enhance this process by leveraging neural networks to improve robustness and scalability. However, most differentiable ILP methods rely on symbolic datasets, facing challenges when learning directly from raw data. Specifically, they struggle with explicit label leakage: The inability to map continuous inputs to symbolic variables without explicit supervision of input feature labels. In this work, we address this issue by integrating a self-supervised differentiable clustering model with a novel differentiable ILP model, enabling rule learning from raw data without explicit label leakage. The learned rules effectively describe raw data through its features. We demonstrate that our method intuitively and precisely learns generalized rules from time series and image data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c0\ub3c4\ub418\ub294 \ubbf8\ubd84 \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130\ub9c1 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubbf8\ubd84 ILP \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc6d0\uc2dc \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801 \ub808\uc774\ube14 \uc720\ucd9c \uc5c6\uc774 \uaddc\uce59 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uaddc\uce59 \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ud22c\uba85\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \ub192\uc740 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \ubbf8\ubd84 ILP \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uae30\ud638 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uba70 \uc6d0\uc2dc \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc9c1\uc811 \ud559\uc2b5\ud560 \ub54c \ub3c4\uc804\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc790\uae30 \uc9c0\ub3c4 \ubbf8\ubd84 \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130\ub9c1 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubbf8\ubd84 ILP \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc6d0\uc2dc \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uaddc\uce59\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \uaddc\uce59\uc740 \uc6d0\uc2dc \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc124\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \ubc0f \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub41c \uaddc\uce59\uc744 \uc9c1\uad00\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubc0f \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \ud559\uc2b5\ud568\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uaddc\uce59 \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ud22c\uba85\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \ub192\uc740 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc720\ub3c4 \ub17c\ub9ac \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d(ILP)\uc740 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc0ac\uc2e4\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uaddc\uce59\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\ub294 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ud55c \ud615\ud0dc\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubbf8\ubd84 \uac00\ub2a5 ILP \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uc5ec \uac15\uac74\uc131\uacfc \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \ubbf8\ubd84 ILP \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uae30\ud638 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \uc6d0\uc2dc \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc9c1\uc811 \ud559\uc2b5\ud560 \ub54c \ub3c4\uc804\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788, \uba85\uc2dc\uc801 \ub808\uc774\ube14 \uc720\ucd9c \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uc785\ub825 \ud2b9\uc9d5 \ub808\uc774\ube14\uc758 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801 \uac10\ub3c5 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc5f0\uc18d \uc785\ub825\uc744 \uae30\ud638 \ubcc0\uc218\uc5d0 \ub9e4\ud551\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc790\uae30 \uc9c0\ub3c4 \ubbf8\ubd84 \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130\ub9c1 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubbf8\ubd84 ILP \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uba85\uc2dc\uc801 \ub808\uc774\ube14 \uc720\ucd9c \uc5c6\uc774 \uc6d0\uc2dc \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uaddc\uce59 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \uaddc\uce59\uc740 \uc6d0\uc2dc \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc124\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc6b0\ub9ac \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \ubc0f \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc9c1\uad00\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub41c \uaddc\uce59\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

In this setting, linear temporal logic (LTL) has recently been adopted as a powerful framework for specifying structured, temporally extended tasks. While existing approaches successfully train generalist policies, they often struggle to effectively capture the rich logical and temporal structure inherent in LTL specifications. In this work, we address these concerns with a novel approach to learn structured task representations that facilitate training and generalisation.

Despite notable advances in recent decades, the lack of high-quality data and the reliance of traditional causal discovery algorithms (TCDA) on the assumption of no latent confounders, as well as their tendency to overlook the precise semantics of latent variables, have long been major obstacles to the broader application of causal discovery. To address this issue, we propose a novel causal modeling framework, TLVD, which integrates the metadata-based reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with the data-driven modeling capabilities of TCDA for inferring latent variables and their semantics. Specifically, we first employ a data-driven approach to construct a causal graph that incorporates latent variables. Then, we employ multi-LLM collaboration for latent variable inference, modeling this process as a game with incomplete information and seeking its Bayesian Nash Equilibrium (BNE) to infer the possible specific latent variables. Finally, to validate the inferred latent variables across multiple real-world web-based data sources, we leverage LLMs for evidence exploration to ensure traceability. We comprehensively evaluate TLVD on three de-identified real patient datasets provided by a hospital and two benchmark datasets. Extensive experimental results confirm the effectiveness and reliability of TLVD, with average improvements of 32.67% in Acc, 62.21% in CAcc, and 26.72% in ECit across the five datasets.", "AI":

We introduce Hippocampus, an agentic memory management system that uses compact binary signatures for semantic search and lossless token-ID streams for exact content reconstruction. Its core is a Dynamic Wavelet Matrix (DWM) that compresses and co-indexes both streams to support ultra-fast search in the compressed domain, thus avoiding costly dense-vector or graph computations. This design scales linearly with memory size, making it suitable for long-horizon agentic deployments.

Nevertheless, in real-world applications, GUI agents are often faced with non-stationary environments, leading to high computational costs for data curation and policy optimization. In this report, we introduce a novel MLLM-centered framework for GUI agents, which consists of two components: agentic-Q estimation and step-wise policy optimization. The former one aims to optimize a Q-model that can generate step-wise values to evaluate the contribution of a given action to task completion. The latter one takes step-wise samples from the state-action trajectory as inputs, and optimizes the policy via reinforcement learning with our agentic-Q model. It should be noticed that (i) all state-action trajectories are produced by the policy itself, so that the data collection costs are manageable; (ii) the policy update is decoupled from the environment, ensuring stable and efficient optimization.

In deep reinforcement learning (DRL), neural networks with up to 5% of their original weights can still be trained with minimal performance loss compared to their dense counterparts. However, most existing methods rely on unstructured fine-grained sparsity, which limits hardware acceleration opportunities due to irregular computation patterns. Structured coarse-grained sparsity enables hardware acceleration, yet typically degrades performance and increases pruning complexity. In this work, we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first study on N:M structured sparsity in RL, which balances compression, performance, and hardware efficiency. Our framework enforces row-wise N:M sparsity throughout training for all networks in off-policy RL (TD3), maintaining compatibility with accelerators that support N:M sparse matrix operations. Experiments on continuous-control benchmarks show that RNM-TD3, our N:M sparse agent, outperforms its dense counterpart at 50%-75% sparsity (e.g., 2:4 and 1:4), achieving up to a 14% increase in performance at 2:4 sparsity on the Ant environment.

This paper identifies and addresses three key redundancies: (1) the redundant processing of a large library of function descriptions for every request; (2) the redundant use of a large, slow model to generate an entire, often predictable, token sequence; and (3) the redundant generation of fixed, boilerplate parameter syntax. We introduce HyFunc, a novel framework that systematically eliminates these inefficiencies. HyFunc employs a hybrid-model cascade where a large model distills user intent into a single \"soft token.\" This token guides a lightweight retriever to select relevant functions and directs a smaller, prefix-tuned model to generate the final call, thus avoiding redundant context processing and full-sequence generation by the large model. To eliminate syntactic redundancy, our \"dynamic templating\" technique injects boilerplate parameter syntax on-the-fly within an extended vLLM engine. To avoid potential limitations in generalization, we evaluate HyFunc on an unseen benchmark dataset, BFCL. Experimental results demonstrate that HyFunc achieves an excellent balance between efficiency and performance. It achieves an inference latency of 0.828 seconds, outperforming all baseline models, and reaches a performance of 80.1%, surpassing all models with a comparable parameter scale.

We introduce an explicit Information Bottleneck regularizer on the concept layer that penalizes $I(X;C)$ while preserving task-relevant information in $I(C;Y)$, encouraging minimal-sufficient concept representations. We derive two practical variants (a variational objective and an entropy-based surrogate) and integrate them into standard CBM training without architectural changes or additional supervision. Evaluated across six CBM families and three benchmarks, the IB-regularized models consistently outperform their vanilla counterparts. Information-plane analyses further corroborate the intended behavior. These results indicate that enforcing a minimal-sufficient concept bottleneck improves both predictive performance and the reliability of concept-level interventions. The proposed regularizer offers a theoretic-grounded, architecture-agnostic path to more faithful and intervenable CBMs, resolving prior evaluation inconsistencies by aligning training protocols and demonstrating robust gains across model families and datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc815\ubcf4 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ub808\uade4\ub7ec\ub77c\uc774\uc800\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud568.", "motivation": "CBM\uc740 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc815\ud655\uc131\uacfc \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ub5a8\uc5b4\ub728\ub9ac\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud568.", "method": "\uac1c\ub150 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ub808\uade4\ub7ec\ub77c\uc774\uc800\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec $I(X;C)$\ub97c \ud328\ub110\ud2f0\ud558\uace0 $I(C;Y)$\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\uc5c5 \uad00\ub828 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0.", "result": "\uc5ec\uc12f \uac1c\uc758 CBM \ud328\ubc00\ub9ac\uc640 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c IB-\uc815\uaddc\ud654 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uae30\uc874 \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc784.", "conclusion": "\ucd5c\uc18c \ucda9\ubd84 \uac1c\ub150 \ubcd1\ubaa9\uc744 \uac15\uc81c\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc608\uce21 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \uac1c\ub150 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uac1c\uc785 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ubaa8\ub450 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90c.", "translated_summary": "\uac1c\ub150 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ubaa8\ub378(CBM)\uc740 \uc778\uac04\uc774 \uc774\ud574\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac1c\ub150 \uacc4\uce35\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ub77c\uc6b0\ud305\ud558\uc5ec \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc885\uc885 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc774 \uac10\uc18c\ud558\uace0 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ud574\uce58\ub294 \uac1c\ub150 \uc720\ucd9c\ub85c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 $I(X;C)$\uc5d0 \ud328\ub110\ud2f0\ub97c \ubd80\uc5ec\ud558\uace0 $I(C;Y)$\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\uc5c5 \uad00\ub828 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uac1c\ub150 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\uc5d0 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \uc815\uaddc\ud654\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \ucd5c\uc18c \ucda9\ubd84 \uac1c\ub150 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \ubcc0\ud615(\ubcc0\ubd84 \ubaa9\ud45c \ubc0f \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \uae30\ubc18 \ub300\ub9ac\uc790)\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uace0 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ubcc0\ud654\ub098 \ucd94\uac00 \uac10\ub3c5 \uc5c6\uc774 \ud45c\uc900 CBM \ud6c8\ub828\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5ec\uc12f \uac1c\uc758 CBM \ud328\ubc00\ub9ac\uc640 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, IB-\uc815\uaddc\ud654 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uc6d0\ub798 \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc815\ubcf4 \ud3c9\uba74 \ubd84\uc11d\uc740 \uc758\ub3c4\ub41c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ucd94\uac00\ub85c \ud655\uc778\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ucd5c\uc18c \ucda9\ubd84 \uac1c\ub150 \ubcd1\ubaa9\uc744 \uac15\uc81c\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc608\uce21 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \uac1c\ub150 \uc218\uc900 \uac1c\uc785\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b4\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc815\uaddc\ud654\uc790\ub294 \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uae30\ubc18\uc744 \ub450\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uace0 \uac1c\uc785 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c CBM\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uba70, \ud6c8\ub828 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \uc815\ub82c\ud558\uace0 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378 \ud328\ubc00\ub9ac \ubc0f \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc774\uc775\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90c\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc774\uc804 \ud3c9\uac00 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, long-horizon multi-step tool planning is challenging, because the exploration space suffers from a combinatorial explosion. In this scenario, even when a correct tool-use path is found, it is usually considered an immediate reward for current training, which would not provide any reusable information for subsequent training. In this paper, we argue that historically successful trajectories contain reusable tool-transition patterns, which can be leveraged throughout the whole training process. Inspired by ant colony optimization where historically successful paths can be reflected by the pheromone, we propose Pheromone-Guided Policy Optimization (PhGPO), which learns a trajectory-based transition pattern (i.e., pheromone) from historical trajectories and then uses the learned pheromone to guide policy optimization. This learned pheromone provides explicit and reusable guidance that steers policy optimization toward historically successful tool transitions, thereby improving long-horizon tool planning. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed PhGPO.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 Pheromone-Guided Policy Optimization (PhGPO)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc804\ud658 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uc7a5\uae30 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ub3c4\uad6c \uacc4\ud68d\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc7a5\uae30 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ub3c4\uad6c \uacc4\ud68d\uc758 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uace0, \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc778 \uacfc\uac70 \uacbd\ub85c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "Pheromone-Guided Policy Optimization (PhGPO)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801 \uacbd\ub85c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ub41c \uc804\uc774 \ud328\ud134(\ud398\ub85c\ubaac)\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \uc815\ucc45 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc5d0 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ud55c PhGPO\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc885\ud569\uc801\uc778 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\uac00 \uc81c\uacf5\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc804\ud658\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\ub294 \uba85\ud655\ud558\uace0 \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc9c0\uce68\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc5ec \uc7a5\uae30 \ub3c4\uad6c \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae34 \uc218\ud3c9 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ub3c4\uad6c \uacc4\ud68d\uc740 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uacf5\uac04\uc774 \uc870\ud569 \ud3ed\ubc1c \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud558\uc5ec \uc5b4\ub835\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uacbd\ub85c\uac00 \ubc1c\uacac\ub418\ub354\ub77c\ub3c4, \uadf8\uac83\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud604\uc7ac \ud6c8\ub828\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc989\uac01\uc801\uc778 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \uac04\uc8fc\ub418\uba70, \ud6c4\uc18d \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc778 \uacbd\ub85c\uac00 \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c \uc804\ud658 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc804\uccb4 \ud6c8\ub828 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ud65c\uc6a9\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc778 \uacbd\ub85c\uac00 \ud398\ub85c\ubaac\uc73c\ub85c \ubc18\uc601\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac1c\ubbf8 \uc9d1\ub2e8 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc5d0\uc11c \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc544, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801 \uacbd\ub85c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc804\uc774 \ud328\ud134(\uc989, \ud398\ub85c\ubaac)\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uace0 \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \ud398\ub85c\ubaac\uc744 \uc815\ucc45 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub85c \uc548\ub0b4\ud558\ub294 Pheromone-Guided Policy Optimization (PhGPO)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \ud398\ub85c\ubaac\uc740 \uc815\ucc45 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc804\ud658\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\ub294 \uba85\ud655\ud558\uace0 \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc548\ub0b4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc885\ud569\uc801\uc778 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uac00 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c PhGPO\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, traditional MSBO assumes the input variables of the objective function to be independent and identically distributed, limiting its effectiveness in scenarios where causal information is available and interventions can be performed, such as clinical trials or policy-making. In the single-source domain, Causal Bayesian Optimization (CBO) extends standard BO with the principles of causality, enabling better modeling of variable dependencies. This leads to more accurate optimization, improved decision-making, and more efficient use of low-cost information sources. In this article, we propose a principled integration of the MSBO and CBO methodologies in the multi-source domain, leveraging the strengths of both to enhance optimization efficiency and reduce computational complexity in higher-dimensional problems. We present the theoretical foundations of both Causal and Multi-Source Bayesian Optimization, and demonstrate how their synergy informs our Multi-Source Causal Bayesian Optimization (MSCBO) algorithm. We compare the performance of MSCBO against its foundational counterparts for both synthetic and real-world datasets with varying levels of noise, highlighting the robustness and applicability of MSCBO. Based on our findings, we conclude that integrating MSBO with the causality principles of CBO facilitates dimensionality reduction and lowers operational costs, ultimately improving convergence speed,

We present OR-Agent, a configurable multi-agent research framework designed for automated exploration in rich experimental environments. OR-Agent organizes research as a structured tree-based workflow that explicitly models branching hypothesis generation and systematic backtracking, enabling controlled management of research trajectories beyond simple mutation-crossover loops. At its core, we introduce an evolutionary-systematic ideation mechanism that unifies evolutionary selection of research starting points, comprehensive research plan generation, and coordinated exploration within a research tree. We further propose a hierarchical optimization-inspired reflection system: short-term experimental reflection operates as a form of verbal gradient providing immediate corrective signals; long-term reflection accumulates cross-experiment insights as verbal momentum; and memory compression serves as a regularization mechanism analogous to weight decay, preserving essential signals while mitigating drift. Together, these components form a principled architecture governing research dynamics. We conduct extensive experiments across classical combinatorial optimization benchmarks-including traveling salesman, capacitated vehicle routing, bin packing, orienteering, and multiple knapsack problems-as well as simulation-based cooperative driving scenarios. Results demonstrate that OR-Agent outperforms strong evolutionary baselines while providing a general, extensible, and inspectable framework for AI-assisted scientific discovery.

We formalize this phenomenon by modeling attention as a projection onto the convex hull of key vectors and analyzing its entropic (softmax-like) relaxation. Our main theoretical contribution is a face-stability theorem showing that, under a strict complementarity margin (a support gap (\u0394) certified by KKT multipliers), entropic attention concentrates on a constant-size active face: the total mass assigned to inactive tokens decays exponentially as (\\exp(-\u03a9(\u0394/\\varepsilon))), while the error on the active face scales linearly in the temperature/regularization parameter (\\varepsilon). This yields a practical criterion for when sparse long-context decoding is safe and provides a principled knob to trade accuracy for compute.\n  Building on these guarantees, we introduce Vashista Sparse Attention, a drop-in mechanism that maintains a small candidate set per query through a paging-style context selection strategy compatible with modern inference stacks. Across long-context evaluations, we observe stable constant-size effective support, strong wall-clock speedups, and minimal quality degradation in the regimes predicted by the support-gap diagnostics. Finally, we discuss deployment implications for privacy-sensitive and air-gapped settings, where interchangeable attention modules enable predictable latency and cost without external retrieval

The system parses contractual text into structured schemas, generates Solidity code, and performs automated quality assessment through compilation and security checks. Using CrewAI-style agent teams with iterative refinement, the pipeline produces structured artifacts with full provenance metadata. Quality is measured across five dimensions, including functional completeness, variable fidelity, state-machine correctness, business-logic fidelity, and code quality aggregated into composite scores. The framework supports paired evaluation against ground-truth implementations, quantifying alignment and identifying systematic error modes such as logic omissions and state transition inconsistencies.

However, relying on sparse rewards makes this process highly sample-inefficient, as models must navigate vast search spaces with minimal feedback. While classic curriculum learning aims to mitigate this by ordering data based on complexity, the right ordering for a specific model is often unclear. To address this, we propose Goldilocks, a novel teacher-driven data sampling strategy that aims to predict each question's difficulty for the student model. The teacher model selects questions of appropriate difficulty for the student model, i.e., questions that are neither too easy nor too hard (Goldilocks principle), while training the student with GRPO.

Meanwhile, organizations underuse historical A/B results and rich content embeddings that could guide prioritization and creative iteration. We present a unified framework to (i) prioritize which variants to test, (ii) explain why winners win, and (iii) surface targeted opportunities for new, higher-potential variants. Leveraging treatment embeddings and historical outcomes, we train a CTR ranking model with fixed effects for contextual shifts that scores candidates while balancing value and content diversity. For better interpretability and understanding, we project treatments onto curated semantic marketing attributes and re-express the ranker in this space via a sign-consistent, sparse constrained Lasso, yielding per-attribute coefficients and signed contributions for visual explanations, top-k drivers, and natural-language insights. We then compute an opportunity index combining attribute importance (from the ranker) with under-expression in the current experiment to flag missing, high-impact attributes. Finally, LLMs translate ranked opportunities into concrete creative suggestions and estimate both learning and conversion potential, enabling faster, more informative, and more efficient test cycles. These components have been built into a real Adobe product, called \\textit{Experimentation Accelerator}, to provide AI-based insights and opportunities to scale experimentation for customers. We provide an evaluation of the performance of the proposed framework on some real-world experiments by Adobe business customers that validate the high quality of the generation pipeline.", "AI":

This paper provides a definitive answer: we prove that $\u03b2^\\star$-IPS, an estimator with an optimal additive baseline, asymptotically dominates SNIPS in Mean Squared Error. By analytically decomposing the variance gap, we show that SNIPS is asymptotically equivalent to using a specific -- but generally sub-optimal -- additive baseline. Our results theoretically justify shifting from self-normalisation to optimal baseline corrections for both ranking and recommendation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ube44\uc815\ucc45 \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\ubcf8 \ubca0\uc774\uc2a4\ub77c\uc778\uc774 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud568\uc744 \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc99d\uba85\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc790\uac00 \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \ubca0\uc774\uc2a4\ub77c\uc778 \uc218\uc815\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \uc804\ud658\uc744 \uc815\ub2f9\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ube44\uc815\ucc45 \ud3c9\uac00(OPE)\ub294 \ube44\uc2fc \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uac1c\uc785 \uc5c6\uc774 \ub7ad\ud0b9 \ubc0f \ucd94\ucc9c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \ub367\uc148 \uae30\ubc18 \uc120\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 $\u03b2^\bigstar$-IPS\ub77c\ub294 \ucd94\uc815\uae30\uac00 \ud3c9\uade0 \uc81c\uacf1 \uc624\ucc28\uc5d0\uc11c SNIPS\ub97c \uc810\uadfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd08\uc6b0\uc138\ud568\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "SNIPS\ub294 \ud2b9\uc815\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc544\ub7ab\ucabd \ucd5c\uc801\uc774 \uc544\ub2cc \ub367\uc148 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uacfc \uc810\uadfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub3d9\ub4f1\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ub7ad\ud0b9 \ubc0f \ucd94\ucc9c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uac00 \uc815\uaddc\ud654\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uae30\uc900 \uc218\uc815\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \uc804\ud658\uc744 \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\ub2f9\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc624\ud504 \uc815\ucc45 \ud3c9\uac00(OPE)\ub294 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4dc\ub294 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uac1c\uc785 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc21c\uc704 \ubc0f \ucd94\ucc9c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc790\uae30 \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \uc5ed \ud655\ub960 \ucd94\uc815(SNIPS)\uc740 \uacf1\uc148 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec OPE\uc758 \ubd84\uc0b0 \uac10\uc18c\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud45c\uc900 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc\uc758 \uc624\ud504 \uc815\ucc45 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \ub367\uc148 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ubcc0\uc218\uac00 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc740 \ubd80\uc871\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uacb0\uc815\uc801\uc778 \ub2f5\ubcc0\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \ub367\uc148 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \uac16\ub294 \ucd94\uc815\uae30\uc778 $\u03b2^\bigstar$-IPS\uac00 \ud3c9\uade0 \uc81c\uacf1 \uc624\ucc28\uc5d0\uc11c SNIPS\ub97c \uc810\uadfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c0\ubc30\ud568\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubd84\uc0b0 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\uc5ec, SNIPS\uac00 \ud2b9\uc815\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uc704 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \ub367\uc148 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uacfc \uc810\uadfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub3d9\ub4f1\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc21c\uc704 \ubc0f \ucd94\ucc9c\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc790\uae30 \uc815\uaddc\ud654\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uae30\uc900 \uc218\uc815\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \uc804\ud658\uc744 \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\ub2f9\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, these methods underperform in multi-goal environments with sparse rewards, where actions must be linked to temporally distant outcomes. To address this limitation, we first propose MOC-HER, which integrates the Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) mechanism into the MOC framework. By relabeling goals from achieved outcomes, MOC-HER can solve sparse reward environments that are intractable for the original MOC. However, this approach is insufficient for object manipulation tasks, where the reward depends on the object reaching the goal rather than on the agent's direct interaction. This makes it extremely difficult for HRL agents to discover how to interact with these objects. To overcome this issue, we introduce Dual Objectives Hindsight Experience Replay (2HER), a novel extension that creates two sets of virtual goals. In addition to relabeling goals based on the object's final state (standard HER), 2HER also generates goals from the agent's effector positions, rewarding the agent for both interacting with the object and completing the task. Experimental results in robotic manipulation environments show that MOC-2HER achieves success rates of up to 90%, compared to less than 11% for both MOC and MOC-HER. These results highlight the effectiveness of our dual objective relabeling strategy in sparse reward, multi-goal tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 MOC-HER \ubc0f

However, their performance often degrades on heterophilic hypergraphs, where nodes connected by the same hyperedge tend to have dissimilar semantic representations or belong to different classes. While several HyGNNs, including our prior work BHyGNN, have been proposed to address heterophily, their reliance on labeled data significantly limits their applicability in real-world scenarios where annotations are scarce or costly. To overcome this limitation, we introduce BHyGNN+, a self-supervised learning framework that extends BHyGNN for representation learning on heterophilic hypergraphs without requiring ground-truth labels. The core idea of BHyGNN+ is hypergraph duality, a structural transformation where the roles of nodes and hyperedges are interchanged. By contrasting augmented views of a hypergraph against its dual using cosine similarity, our framework captures essential structural patterns in a fully unsupervised manner. Notably, this duality-based formulation eliminates the need for negative samples, a common requirement in existing hypergraph contrastive learning methods that is often difficult to satisfy in practice. Extensive experiments on eleven benchmark datasets demonstrate that BHyGNN+ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art supervised and self-supervised baselines on both heterophilic and homophilic hypergraphs.

Recently proposed Causal Foundation Models (CFMs) promise a more unified approach by amortising causal discovery and inference in a single step. However, in their current state, they do not allow for the incorporation of any domain knowledge, which can lead to suboptimal predictions. We bridge this gap by introducing methods to condition CFMs on causal information, such as the causal graph or more readily available ancestral information. When access to complete causal graph information is too strict a requirement, our approach also effectively leverages partial causal information. We systematically evaluate conditioning strategies and find that injecting learnable biases into the attention mechanism is the most effective method to utilise full and partial causal information. Our experiments show that this conditioning allows a general-purpose CFM to match the performance of specialised models trained on specific causal structures. Overall, our approach addresses a central hurdle on the path towards all-in-one causal foundation models: the capability to answer causal queries in a data-driven manner while effectively leveraging

Existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness: memory compression risks losing critical details required for complex reasoning, while retaining raw text introduces unnecessary computational overhead for simple queries. The crux lies in the limitations of monolithic memory representations and static retrieval mechanisms, which fail to emulate the flexible and proactive memory scheduling capabilities observed in humans, thus struggling to adapt to diverse problem scenarios. Inspired by the principle of cognitive economy, we propose HyMem, a hybrid memory architecture that enables dynamic on-demand scheduling through multi-granular memory representations. HyMem adopts a dual-granular storage scheme paired with a dynamic two-tier retrieval system: a lightweight module constructs summary-level context for efficient response generation, while an LLM-based deep module is selectively activated only for complex queries, augmented by a reflection mechanism for iterative reasoning refinement. Experiments show that HyMem achieves strong performance on both the LOCOMO and LongMemEval benchmarks, outperforming full-context while reducing computational cost by 92.6\\%, establishing a state-of-the-art balance between efficiency and performance in long-term memory management.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ud558\uc774\uba64(HyMem)\uc740 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc131\ub2a5 \uc0ac\uc774\uc758

A common strategy enforces invariance and equivariance through architectural constraints such as equivariant denoisers and invariant priors. In this paper, we challenge this tradition through the alternative canonicalization perspective: first map each sample to an orbit representative with a canonical pose or order, train an unconstrained (non-equivariant) diffusion or flow model on the canonical slice, and finally recover the invariant distribution by sampling a random symmetry transform at generation time. Building on a formal quotient-space perspective, our work provides a comprehensive theory of canonical diffusion by proving: (i) the correctness, universality and superior expressivity of canonical generative models over invariant targets; (ii) canonicalization accelerates training by removing diffusion score complexity induced by group mixtures and reducing conditional variance in flow matching. We then show that aligned priors and optimal transport act complementarily with canonicalization and further improves training efficiency. We instantiate the framework for molecular graph generation under $S_n \\times SE(3)$ symmetries. By leveraging geometric spectra-based canonicalization and mild positional encodings, canonical diffusion significantly outperforms equivariant baselines in 3D molecule generation tasks, with similar or even less computation. Moreover, with a novel architecture Canon, CanonFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance on the challenging GEOM-DRUG dataset, and the advantage remains large in few-step generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud654\ud559\uacfc \uacfc\ud559\uc758 \uc0dd\uc131 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \uadf8\ub8f9 \ub300\uce6d\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ubd88\ubcc0\uc778 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubd88\ubcc0\uc131\uc744 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud558\uac8c \uac15\uc81c\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95 \ub300\uc2e0 \ub300\uce6d \ubcc0\ud658 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubd88\ubcc0 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \ud68c\ubcf5\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud654\ud559 \ubc0f \uacfc\ud559\uc758 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc791\uc5c5\uc740 \uadf8\ub8f9 \ub300\uce6d\uc5d0 \ubd88\ubcc0\uc778 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ubd88\ubcc0\uc131\uacfc \ub3d9\ub4f1\uc131\uc744 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uac15\uc81c\ud574\uc654\ub2e4.", "method": "\uac01 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \ud45c\uc900 \uc790\uc138 \ub610\ub294 \uc21c\uc11c\uc758 \uada4\ub3c4 \ub300\ud45c\uc5d0 \ub9e4\ud551\ud55c \ud6c4, \ube44\uc81c\uc57d\uc131(\ube44\ub3d9\ub4f1) \ud655\uc0b0 \ub610\ub294 \ud750\ub984 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud45c\uc900 \uc2ac\ub77c\uc774\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uace0, \uc0dd\uc131 \uc2dc \ub79c\ub364 \ub300\uce6d \ubcc0\ud658\uc744 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\ud558\uc5ec \ubd88\ubcc0 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \ud68c\ubcf5\ud558\ub294 \uc811\uadfc\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud45c\uc900 \ud655\uc0b0\uc758 \uc774\ub860\uc744 \uc815\ub9bd\ud558\uc5ec \ud45c\uc900 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131, \ubcf4\ud3b8\uc131 \ubc0f \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \ud45c\ud604\ub825\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uace0, \ud45c\uc900\ud654\uac00 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud558\uba70, \uc815\ub82c\ub41c \uc0ac\uc804 \ubc0f \ucd5c\uc801 \uc218\uc1a1\uc774 \uc0c1\ud638 \ubcf4\uc644\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud6c8\ub828 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uad6c\uc870 \ud654\ud559\uc801 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 3D \ubd84\uc790 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub3d9\ub4f1 \uae30\uc900\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud604\uc800\ud788 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud558\uace0, CanonFlow\ub294 GEOM-DRUG \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub9ce\uc740 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc791\uc5c5\uc740 \uadf8\ub8f9 \ub300\uce6d(\uc608: \uc21c\uc5f4 \ubc0f \ud68c\uc804)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubd88\ubcc0\uc131\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc5d0 \uad00\ub828\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uc804\ub7b5\uc740 \ub300\uce6d \uc81c\uac70\uae30 \ubc0f \ubd88\ubcc0 \uc120\ud589 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubd88\ubcc0\uc131\uacfc \ub3d9\ub4f1\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc81c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub300\uce6d \ubcc0\ud658 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubd88\ubcc0 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \ud68c\ubcf5\ud558\ub294 \ub300\uc548\uc801 \uc815\uc900\ud654 \uad00\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uba3c\uc800 \uac01 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \uc815\uc900 \uc790\uc138 \ub610\ub294 \uc21c\uc11c\uc758 \uada4\ub3c4 \ub300\ud45c\ub85c \ub9e4\ud551\ud558\uace0, \ube44\uc81c\uc57d(\ube44\ub3d9\ub4f1) \ud655\uc0b0 \ub610\ub294 \ud750\ub984 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc815\uc900 \uc2ac\ub77c\uc774\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6c8\ub828\ud55c \ud6c4, \uc0dd\uc131 \uc2dc \ub79c\ub364 \ub300\uce6d \ubcc0\ud658\uc744 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\ud558\uc5ec \ubd88\ubcc0 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \ud68c\ubcf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc815\ud615\uc801 \ubaab-\uacf5\uac04 \uad00\uc810\uc744 \ud1a0\ub300\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc791\uc5c5\uc740 \uc815\uc900 \ud655\uc0b0\uc758 \uc885\ud569\uc801\uc778 \uc774\ub860\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, (i) \ubd88\ubcc0 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc815\uc900 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131, \ubcf4\ud3b8\uc131 \ubc0f \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \ud45c\ud604\ub825\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uace0;

However, achieving effective zero-shot generalization in previously unseen domains remains a significant challenge. Motivated by the consistent nature of kinematics across diverse domains, we aim to incorporate domain-invariant knowledge to enhance zero-shot trajectory prediction capabilities. The key challenges include: 1) effectively extracting domain-invariant scene representations, and 2) integrating invariant features with kinematic models to enable generalized predictions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel generalizable Physics-guided Causal Model (PCM), which comprises two core components: a Disentangled Scene Encoder, which adopts intervention-based disentanglement to extract domain-invariant features from scenes, and a CausalODE Decoder, which employs a causal attention mechanism to effectively integrate kinematic models with meaningful contextual information. Extensive experiments on real-world autonomous driving datasets demonstrate our method's superior zero-shot generalization performance in unseen cities, significantly outperforming competitive baselines.

While AI offers substantial efficiency improvements, existing solutions lack comprehensive reasoning capabilities and internal mechanisms to ensure reliability within regulated, high-stakes environments. Full automation remains impractical and inadvisable in scenarios where human judgment and accountability are critical. This study presents a decision-negative, human-in-the-loop agentic system that incorporates an adversarial self-critique mechanism as a bounded safety architecture for regulated underwriting workflows. Within this system, a critic agent challenges the primary agent's conclusions prior to submitting recommendations to human reviewers. This internal system of checks and balances addresses a critical gap in AI safety for regulated workflows. Additionally, the research develops a formal taxonomy of failure modes to characterize potential errors by decision-negative agents. This taxonomy provides a structured framework for risk identification and risk management in high-stakes applications. Experimental evaluation using 500 expert-validated underwriting cases demonstrates that the adversarial critique mechanism reduces AI hallucination rates from 11.3% to 3.8% and increases decision accuracy from 92% to 96%. At the same time, the framework enforces strict human authority over all binding decisions by design.

Preprint", "summary": "Most evaluations of External Memory Module assume a static setting: memory is built offline and queried at a fixed state. In practice, memory is streaming: new facts arrive continuously, insertions interleave with retrievals, and the memory state evolves while the model is serving queries. In this regime, accuracy and cost are governed by the full memory lifecycle, which encompasses the ingestion, maintenance, retrieval, and integration of information into generation. We present Neuromem, a scalable testbed that benchmarks External Memory Modules under an interleaved insertion-and-retrieval protocol and decomposes its lifecycle into five dimensions including memory data structure, normalization strategy, consolidation policy, query formulation strategy, and context integration mechanism. Using three representative datasets LOCOMO, LONGMEMEVAL, and MEMORYAGENTBENCH, Neuromem evaluates interchangeable variants within a shared serving stack, reporting token-level F1 and insertion/retrieval latency. Overall, we observe that performance typically degrades as memory grows across rounds, and time-related queries remain the most challenging category.

Project page: https://github.com/AdAstraAbyssoque/Scaling-the-Scaling-Logic", "summary": "Scaling verifiable training signals remains a key bottleneck for Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). Logical reasoning is a natural substrate: constraints are formal and answers are programmatically checkable. However, prior synthesis pipelines either depend on expert-written code or operate within fixed templates/skeletons, which limits growth largely to instance-level perturbations. We propose SSLogic, an agentic meta-synthesis framework that scales at the task-family level by iteratively synthesizing and repairing executable Generator--Validator program pairs in a closed Generate--Validate--Repair loop, enabling continuous family evolution with controllable difficulty. To ensure reliability, we introduce a Multi-Gate Validation Protocol that combines multi-strategy consistency checks with Adversarial Blind Review, where independent agents must solve instances by writing and executing code to filter ambiguous or ill-posed tasks.

However, lengthy contexts significantly increase inference latency, as the computational cost of self-attention grows quadratically with sequence length. To mitigate this issue, context compression-particularly soft prompt compressio-has emerged as a widely studied solution, which converts long contexts into shorter memory embeddings via a trained compressor. Existing methods typically compress the entire context indiscriminately into a set of memory tokens, requiring the compressor to capture global dependencies and necessitating extensive pre-training data to learn effective patterns. Inspired by the chunking mechanism in human working memory and empirical observations of the spatial specialization of memory embeddings relative to original tokens, we propose Parallelized Iterative Compression (PIC). By simply modifying the Transformer's attention mask, PIC explicitly restricts the receptive field of memory tokens to sequential local chunks, thereby lowering the difficulty of compressor training. Experiments across multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that PIC consistently outperforms competitive baselines, with superiority being particularly pronounced in high compression scenarios (e.g., achieving relative improvements of 29.8\\% in F1 score and 40.7\\% in EM score on QA tasks at the $64\\times$ compression ratio). Furthermore, PIC significantly expedites the training process.

However, the deployment of LAMs at the edge remains constrained by some fundamental limitations. First, tasks are rigidly tied to specific models, limiting the flexibility. Besides, the computational and memory demands of full-scale LAMs exceed the capacity of most edge devices. Moreover, the current inference pipelines are typically static, making it difficult to respond to real-time changes of tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a prompt-to-agent edge cognition framework (P2AECF), enabling the flexible, efficient, and adaptive edge intelligence. Specifically, P2AECF transforms high-level semantic prompts into executable reasoning workflows through three key mechanisms. First, the prompt-defined cognition parses task intent into abstract and model-agnostic representations. Second, the agent-based modular execution instantiates these tasks using lightweight and reusable cognitive agents dynamically selected based on current resource conditions. Third, the diffusion-controlled inference planning adaptively constructs and refines execution strategies by incorporating runtime feedback and system context. In addition, we illustrate the framework through a representative low-altitude intelligent network use case, showing its ability to deliver adaptive, modular, and scalable edge intelligence for real-time low-altitude aerial collaborations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 P2AECF \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc9c0

In this work, we formalize flowchart reasoning in FOD as grounding user input to flowchart nodes at each dialogue turn while ensuring node transition is consistent with the correct flowchart path. Despite recent advances of LLMs in task-oriented dialogue systems, adapting them to FOD still faces two limitations: (1) LLMs lack an explicit mechanism to represent and reason over flowchart topology, and (2) they are prone to hallucinations, leading to unfaithful flowchart reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose FloCA, a zero-shot flowchart-oriented conversational agent. FloCA uses an LLM for intent understanding and response generation while delegating flowchart reasoning to an external tool that performs topology-constrained graph execution, ensuring faithful and logically consistent node transitions across dialogue turns. We further introduce an evaluation framework with an LLM-based user simulator and five new metrics covering reasoning accuracy and interaction efficiency. Extensive experiments on FLODIAL and PFDial datasets highlight the bottlenecks of existing LLM-based methods and demonstrate the superiority of FloCA.

However, existing agent memory systems suffer from two key gaps: they rely on a one-size-fits-all memory structure and do not model memory structure selection as a context-adaptive decision, limiting their ability to handle heterogeneous interaction patterns and resulting in suboptimal performance. We propose a unified framework, FluxMem, that enables adaptive memory organization for LLM agents. Our framework equips agents with multiple complementary memory structures. It explicitly learns to select among these structures based on interaction-level features, using offline supervision derived from downstream response quality and memory utilization. To support robust long-horizon memory evolution, we further introduce a three-level memory hierarchy and a Beta Mixture Model-based probabilistic gate for distribution-aware memory fusion, replacing brittle similarity thresholds.

While recent studies integrate tree search to enhance long-horizon reasoning, applying these algorithms in web navigation faces two critical challenges: sparse valid paths that lead to inefficient exploration, and a noisy context that dilutes accurate state perception. To address this, we introduce Plan-MCTS, a framework that reformulates web navigation by shifting exploration to a semantic Plan Space. By decoupling strategic planning from execution grounding, it transforms sparse action space into a Dense Plan Tree for efficient exploration, and distills noisy contexts into an Abstracted Semantic History for precise state awareness. To ensure efficiency and robustness, Plan-MCTS incorporates a Dual-Gating Reward to strictly validate both physical executability and strategic alignment and Structural Refinement for on-policy repair of failed subplans. Extensive experiments on WebArena demonstrate that Plan-MCTS achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing current approaches with higher task effectiveness and search efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "Plan-MCTS\ub294 \uc6f9 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uacfc \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc778\uc2dd\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc6f9 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \ub3d5\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "Plan-MCTS\ub294 \uc6f9 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \uacc4\ud68d \uacf5\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \uacc4\ud68d\uacfc \uc2e4\ud589 \uae30\ubc18\uc744 \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\uc5ec \ud76c\ubc15\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9 \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \ubc00\uc9d1 \uacc4\ud68d \ud2b8\ub9ac\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "Plan-MCTS\ub294 WebArena\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \ud604\uc7ac \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Plan-MCTS\ub294 \uc6f9 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uac15\ub825\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc5ec\ub7ec \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc6f9 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud798\uc744 \uc2e4\uc5b4\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc7a5\uae30\uc801\uc778 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud2b8\ub9ac \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc600\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc6f9 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub370\ub294 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \uc800\ud574\ud558\ub294 \ud76c\ubc15\ud55c \uc720\ud6a8 \uacbd\ub85c\uc640 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc778\uc2dd\uc744 \uc800\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uc18c\uc74c\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc6f9 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \uacc4\ud68d \uacf5\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\ud658\ud558\uc5ec \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\ub294 Plan-MCTS \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \uacc4\ud68d\uacfc \uc2e4\ud589 \uae30\ubc18\uc744 \ubd84\ub9ac\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ud76c\ubc15\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9 \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ubc00\uc9d1 \uacc4\ud68d \ud2b8\ub9ac\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\uace0, \uc18c\uc74c\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc744 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc778\uc2dd\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654\ub41c \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \uc5ed\uc0ac\ub85c \uc815\uc81c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uac15\ub825\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 Plan-MCTS\ub294 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uacfc \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud788 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc774\uc911 \uac8c\uc774\ud305 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uace0, \uc2e4\ud328\ud55c \ud558\uc704 \uacc4\ud68d\uc758 \uc815\ucc45 \ub0b4 \uc218\ub9ac\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc138\ubd84\ud654\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, training on real-world applications is hindered by high latency, poor reproducibility, and unverifiable rewards relying on noisy visual proxies. To address the limitations, we present GUI-GENESIS, the first framework to automatically synthesize efficient GUI training environments with verifiable rewards. GUI-GENESIS reconstructs real-world applications into lightweight web environments using multimodal code models and equips them with code-native rewards, executable assertions that provide deterministic reward signals and eliminate visual estimation noise. Extensive experiments show that GUI-GENESIS reduces environment latency by 10 times and costs by over $28,000 per epoch compared to training on real applications. Notably, agents trained with GUI-GENESIS outperform the base model by 14.54% and even real-world RL baselines by 3.27% on held-out real-world tasks.

Michael Yates", "Pasquale Minervini", "T. Ian Simpson"], "title": "Process-Supervised Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Reliable Clinical Reasoning", "comment": null, "summary": "Clinical decision-making requires nuanced reasoning over heterogeneous evidence and traceable justifications. While recent LLM multi-agent systems (MAS) show promise, they largely optimise for outcome accuracy while overlooking process-grounded reasoning aligned with clinical standards. One critical real-world case of this is gene-disease validity curation, where experts must determine whether a gene is causally implicated in a disease by synthesising diverse biomedical evidence. We introduce an agent-as-tool reinforcement learning framework for this task with two objectives: (i) process-level supervision to ensure reasoning follows valid clinical pathways, and (ii) efficient coordination via a hierarchical multi-agent system. Our evaluation on the ClinGen dataset shows that with outcome-only rewards, MAS with a GRPO-trained Qwen3-4B supervisor agent substantially improves final outcome accuracy from 0.195 with a base model supervisor to 0.732, but results in poor process alignment (0.392 F1). Conversely, with process + outcome rewards, MAS with GRPO-trained supervisor achieves higher outcome accuracy (0.750) while significantly improving process fidelity to 0.520 F1.

While Agentic Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) using zoom-in tools offers a path forward, we find that standard reinforcement learning struggles to navigate these vast visual spaces without structured domain priors. In this paper, we investigate the interplay between post-training paradigms: comparing Cold-start Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), RLVR, and Agentic RLVR on the UHR RS benchmark.Our controlled studies yield a counter-intuitive finding: high-quality Earth-science text-only QA is a primary driver of UHR visual reasoning gains. Despite lacking images, domain-specific text injects the concepts, mechanistic explanations, and decision rules necessary to guide visual evidence retrieval.Based on this, we propose a staged knowledge injection recipe: (1) cold-starting with scalable, knowledge-graph-verified Earth-science text QA to instill reasoning structures;and (2) \"pre-warming\" on the same hard UHR image-text examples during SFT to stabilize and amplify subsequent tool-based RL.

Real organizational work requires managing many concurrent long-horizon tasks with interleaving, dependencies, and reprioritization. We introduce Multi-Horizon Task Environments (MHTEs): a distinct problem class requiring coherent execution across dozens of interleaved tasks (45+, 500-1500+ steps) within persistent execution contexts spanning hours. We identify four failure modes that cause baseline CUAs to degrade from 16.7% to 8.7% completion as load scales 25% to 100%, a pattern consistent across three independent implementations. These failure modes are context saturation (O(N) vs O(1) growth), memory interference, dependency complexity (DAGs vs. chains), and reprioritization overhead. We present CorpGen, an architecture-agnostic framework addressing these failures via hierarchical planning for multi-horizon goal alignment, sub-agent isolation preventing cross-task contamination, tiered memory (working, structured, semantic), and adaptive summarization. CorpGen simulates corporate environments through digital employees with persistent identities and realistic schedules. Across three CUA backends (UFO2, OpenAI CUA, hierarchical) on OSWorld Office, CorpGen achieves up to 3.5x improvement over baselines (15.2% vs 4.3%) with stable performance under increasing load, confirming that gains stem from architectural mechanisms rather than specific CUA implementations.

The central bottleneck lies in the extreme sparsity of highquality search trajectories and reward signals, arising from the difficulty of scalable longhorizon task construction and the high cost of interactionheavy rollouts involving external tool calls. To address these challenges, we propose REDSearcher, a unified framework that codesigns complex task synthesis, midtraining, and posttraining for scalable searchagent optimization. Specifically, REDSearcher introduces the following improvements: (1) We frame task synthesis as a dualconstrained optimization, where task difficulty is precisely governed by graph topology and evidence dispersion, allowing scalable generation of complex, highquality tasks. (2) We introduce toolaugmented queries to encourage proactive tool use rather than passive recall.(3) During midtraining, we strengthen core atomic capabilities knowledge, planning, and function calling substantially reducing the cost of collecting highquality trajectories for downstream training. (4) We build a local simulated environment that enables rapid, lowcost algorithmic iteration for reinforcement learning experiments. Across both textonly and multimodal searchagent benchmarks, our approach achieves stateoftheart performance. To facilitate future research on longhorizon search agents, we will release 10K highquality complex text search trajectories, 5K multimodal trajectories and 1K text RL query set, and together with code and model checkpoints.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 REDSearcher\ub77c\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \uac80\uc0c9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5 \ud569\uc131, \uc911\uac04 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubc0f \ud6c4 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uacf5\ub3d9 \uc124\uacc4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc5d4\uc9c4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\uc81c \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0\uc790\ub85c \uc804\ud658\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\ub098, \uae4a\uc740 \uac80\uc0c9 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub294 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \uacfc\uc81c\ub85c \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "REDSearcher\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5 \ud569\uc131, \uc911\uac04 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubc0f \ud6c4 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uacf5\ub3d9 \uc124\uacc4\ud558\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc804\uc6a9 \ubc0f \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uac80\uc0c9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc55e\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 10K\uc758 \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \ubcf5\uc7a1 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uac80\uc0c9 \uacbd\ub85c, 5K \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uacbd\ub85c \ubc0f 1K \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 RL \ucffc\ub9ac \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \uacf5\uac1c\ud560 \uc608\uc815\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18 \ubaa9\uc801\uc758 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc5d4\uc9c4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\uc81c \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0\uc790\ub85c \ubcc0\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae4a\uc740 \uac80\uc0c9 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc8fc\uc694 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc740 \uc678\ubd80 \ub3c4\uad6c \ud638\ucd9c\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc740 \ub864\uc544\uc6c3\uc758 \ub192\uc740 \ube44\uc6a9\uacfc \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc7a5\uae30 \uc791\uc5c5 \uad6c\uc131\uc774 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6cc \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \uac80\uc0c9 \uada4\uc801\uacfc \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc2e0\ud638\uc758 \uadf9\ub2e8\uc801\uc778 \ud76c\uc18c\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 REDSearcher\ub77c\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uac80\uc0c9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5 \ud569\uc131, \uc911\uac04 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubc0f \ud6c4 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uacf5\ub3d9 \uc124\uacc4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Existing goal recognition methods typically rely on an optimal goal-oriented policy representation, which may differ from the actor's true behavior and hinder the accurate recognition of their goal. To address this gap, this paper introduces Goal Recognition Alignment through Imitation Learning (GRAIL), which leverages imitation learning and inverse reinforcement learning to learn one goal-directed policy for each candidate goal directly from (potentially suboptimal) demonstration trajectories. By scoring an observed partial trajectory with each learned goal-directed policy in a single forward pass, GRAIL retains the one-shot inference capability of classical goal recognition while leveraging learned policies that can capture suboptimal and systematically biased behavior. Across the evaluated domains, GRAIL increases the F1-score by more than 0.5 under systematically biased optimal behavior, achieves gains of approximately 0.1-0.3 under suboptimal behavior, and yields improvements of up to 0.4 under noisy optimal trajectories, while remaining competitive in fully optimal settings. This work contributes toward scalable and robust models for interpreting agent goals in uncertain environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uacfc \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc758\ub3c4\ub97c \uc815\ub82c\ud558\ub294\ub370 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uc774\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc778\uc2dd \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 GRAIL\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc758\ub3c4\uc640 \ub9de\ucd94\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uc774\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "GRAIL\uc740 \ubaa8\ubc29 \ud559\uc2b5\uacfc \uc5ed \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac01 \ud6c4\ubcf4 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub2e8\uc77c \ubaa9\ud45c \uc9c0\ud5a5 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "GRAIL\uc740 \ud3c9\uac00\ub41c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uac01\uac01\uc5d0\uc11c F1 \uc810\uc218\ub97c 0.5 \uc774\uc0c1 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0, \ube44\ucd5c\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0\uc11c \uc57d 0.1-0.3\uc758 \uc774\ub4dd\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, \ub178\uc774\uc988\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \ucd5c\uc801 \uada4\uc801 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \ucd5c\ub300 0.4\uc758 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ud574\uc11d\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uc774\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc758\ub3c4\uc640 \uc77c\uce58\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uc694\uc18c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc778\uc2dd \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc9c0\ud5a5 \uc815\ucc45 \ud45c\ud604\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub294 \ud589\uc704\uc790\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \ud589\ub3d9\uacfc \ub2e4\ub97c \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc778\uc2dd\uc744 \ubc29\ud574\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uac04\uadf9\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubaa8\ubc29 \ud559\uc2b5\uacfc \uc5ed \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac01 \ud6c4\ubcf4 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 (\uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ube44\ucd5c\uc801\uc758) \uc2dc\uc5f0 \uada4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc9c1\uc811 \ud558\ub098\uc758 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc9c0\ud5a5 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 GRAIL\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, a fundamental bottleneck persists: collecting interaction trajectories from real-world websites is expensive and difficult to verify. The underlying state transitions are hidden, leading to reliance on inconsistent and costly external verifiers to evaluate step-level correctness. To address this, we propose AutoWebWorld, a novel framework for synthesizing controllable and verifiable web environments by modeling them as Finite State Machines (FSMs) and use coding agents to translate FSMs into interactive websites. Unlike real websites, where state transitions are implicit, AutoWebWorld explicitly defines all states, actions, and transition rules. This enables programmatic verification: action correctness is checked against predefined rules, and task success is confirmed by reaching a goal state in the FSM graph. AutoWebWorld enables a fully automated search-and-verify pipeline, generating over 11,663 verified trajectories from 29 diverse web environments at only $0.04 per trajectory. Training on this synthetic data significantly boosts real-world performance. Our 7B Web GUI agent outperforms all baselines within 15 steps on WebVoyager. Furthermore, we observe a clear scaling law: as the synthetic data volume increases, performance on WebVoyager and Online-Mind2Web consistently improves.", "AI": {"tldr": "AutoWebWorld \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uc6f9 \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc5ec, \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2e4\uc81c \uc6f9\uc0ac\uc774\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc218\uc9d1\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ube44\uc2f8\uace0 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub835\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0, \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "Finite State Machines(FSMs)\ub85c \uc6f9 \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uace0, \ucf54\ub529 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec FSM\uc744 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uc6f9\uc0ac\uc774\ud2b8\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "AutoWebWorld\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc6f9 \ud658\uacbd\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 11,663\uac1c\uc758 \uac80\uc99d\ub41c \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uba70, \ud6c8\ub828 \uc2dc \uc2e4\uc81c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 7B Web GUI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 WebVoyager\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\uace0, \ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub7c9 \uc99d\uac00\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc77c\uc815\ud558\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc790\uc728 \uc6f9 GUI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc740 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ud488\uc9c8\uacfc \uc591\uc5d0 \ud06c\uac8c \uc758\uc874\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc774 \uc874\uc7ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uc2e4\uc81c \uc6f9\uc0ac\uc774\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc218\uc9d1\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4e4\uace0 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub835\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\ubcf8 \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc804\ud658\uc740 \uc228\uaca8\uc838 \uc788\uc5b4 \ub2e8\uacc4\ubcc4 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ud558\uace0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4dc\ub294 \uc678\ubd80 \uac80\uc99d\uc790\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uac8c \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc6f9 \ud658\uacbd\uc744 Finite State Machines (FSMs)\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uc5ec \uc81c\uc5b4 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc6f9 \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \ud569\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 AutoWebWorld\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \ucf54\ub529 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec FSM\uc744 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uc6f9\uc0ac\uc774\ud2b8\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\uc81c \uc6f9\uc0ac\uc774\ud2b8\uc640\ub294 \ub2ec\ub9ac \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc804\ud658\uc774 \uc554\uc2dc\uc801\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0, AutoWebWorld\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc0c1\ud0dc, \uc870\uce58 \ubc0f \uc804\ud658 \uaddc\uce59\uc744 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\uc758\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8 \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uc870\uce58\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc740 \ubbf8\ub9ac \uc815\uc758\ub41c \uaddc\uce59\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud655\uc778\ub418\uba70, \uc791\uc5c5 \uc131\uacf5\uc740 FSM \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc758 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0 \ub3c4\ub2ec\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ud655\uc778\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Inspired by human reasoning patterns where people solve new problems by leveraging past related cases to constrain search spaces and reduce trial-and-error, we propose Precedent Informed Reasoning (PIR) transforming LRMs'reasoning paradigm from exhaustive self-exploration to guided learning from precedents. PIR addresses two key challenges: what precedents to adopt and how to utilize them. First, Adaptive Precedent Selection (APS) constructs, for each question and LRM, a compact set of precedents that are both semantically related and informative for the model. It ranks examples by a joint score with semantic similarity and model perplexity, then adapts the amount of precedents to maximize perplexity reduction. Second, Test-time Experience Internalization (TEI) is treated as the test-time learning on precedent-informed instruction, updating lightweight adapters to internalize solution patterns and use them as a prior during subsequent reasoning.

As Large Language Models (LLMs) general capabilities rapidly evolve and the proliferation of agentic AI, this version of the risk analysis technical report presents an updated and granular assessment of five critical dimensions: cyber offense, persuasion and manipulation, strategic deception, uncontrolled AI R\\&D, and self-replication. Specifically, we introduce more complex scenarios for cyber offense. For persuasion and manipulation, we evaluate the risk of LLM-to-LLM persuasion on newly released LLMs. For strategic deception and scheming, we add the new experiment with respect to emergent misalignment. For uncontrolled AI R\\&D, we focus on the ``mis-evolution'' of agents as they autonomously expand their memory substrates and toolsets. Besides, we also monitor and evaluate the safety performance of OpenClaw during the interaction on the Moltbook. For self-replication, we introduce a new resource-constrained scenario. More importantly, we propose and validate a series of robust mitigation strategies to address these emerging threats, providing a preliminary technical and actionable pathway for the secure deployment of frontier AI.

We propose Socially-Weighted Alignment (SWA), a game-theoretic framework that modifies inference-time decision making by interpolating between an agent's private objective and an estimate of group welfare via a social weight $\u03bb\\in[0,1]$. In a shared-resource congestion game with $n$ agents and congestion severity $\u03b2$, we show that SWA induces a critical threshold $\u03bb^*=(n-\u03b2)/(n-1)$ above which agents no longer have marginal incentive to increase demand under overload, yielding a phase transition from persistent congestion to stable operation near capacity. We further provide an inference-time algorithmic instantiation of SWA that does not require parameter updates or multi-agent reinforcement learning, and use a multi-agent simulation to empirically validate the predicted threshold behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uacf5\uc720 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ud070 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ubc30\uce58\ud560 \ub54c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uac1c\ubcc4 \uc870\uc815\uacfc \uc9d1\ub2e8 \uc548\uc815\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \uae34\uc7a5 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uac00\uc911\uce58 \uc870\uc815(SWA)\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uac8c\uc784 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uacf5\uc720 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ubc30\uce58\ud560 \ub54c \uac1c\ubcc4 \uc870\uc815\uacfc \uc9d1\ub2e8 \uc548\uc815\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \uac08\ub4f1\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud568\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uac1c\uc778 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc640 \uadf8\ub8f9 \ubcf5\uc9c0 \ucd94\uc815\uce58 \uc0ac\uc774\ub97c \ubcf4\uac04\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc218\uc815\ud558\ub294 SWA \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "SWA\ub294 \uacfc\ubd80\ud558 \uc2dc \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc218\uc694\ub97c \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud55c\uacc4 \uc810\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uba70, \uc774 \uc9c0\uc810\uc744 \ub118\uc5b4\uc11c\uba74 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ub354 \uc774\uc0c1 \ucd94\uac00 \uc218\uc694\ub97c \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub824\ub294 \uc720\uc778\uc774 \uc5c6\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "SWA\ub294 \ubb34\uc815\uccb4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc548\uc815\uc801 \uc791\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \uc0c1\uc804\uc774\ub97c \uc720\ub3c4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610, \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub098 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc774 \ud544\uc694 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uacf5\uc720 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ubc30\uce58\ud558\uba74 \uac1c\ubcc4 \uc815\ub82c\uacfc \uc9d1\ub2e8 \uc548\uc815\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uae34\uc7a5\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc989, \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud569\ub9ac\uc801\uc778 \uacb0\uc815\uc774 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc800\ud558\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubd80\uc815\uc801 \uc678\ubd80\uc131\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uac00\uc911\uce58 \uc815\ub82c(SWA)\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uac8c\uc784 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uac1c\uc778 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc640 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uac00\uc911\uce58 $\u03bb\text{\u2208}[0,1]$\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \uc9d1\ub2e8 \ubcf5\uc9c0 \ucd94\uc815\uce58 \uc0ac\uc774\ub97c \ubcf4\uac04\ud558\uc5ec \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc218\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 $n$\uac1c\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \ud63c\uc7a1\ub3c4 \uc2ec\uac01\ub3c4 $\u03b2$\ub97c \uac16\ub294 \uacf5\uc720 \uc790\uc6d0 \ud63c\uc7a1 \uac8c\uc784\uc5d0\uc11c SWA\uac00 \uacfc\ubd80\ud558 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0\uc11c \uc218\uc694\ub97c \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0ac \ub9c8\uc9c4 \uc720\uc778\uc774 \ub354 \uc774\uc0c1 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4dc\ub294 \ud55c\uacc4 \uc810 $\u03bb^*=(n-\u03b2)/(n-1)$\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ud63c\uc7a1\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6a9\ub7c9 \uadfc\ucc98\uc758 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc791\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \uc0c1\uc804\uc774\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub610\ud55c \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub098 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc774 \ud544\uc694 \uc5c6\ub294 SWA\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \uad6c\ud604\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc608\uce21\ub41c \uc784\uacc4\uac12 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

These plans consist of ordered steps structured according to a Temporal Execution Order (TEO, a directed acyclic graph that ensures each step executes only after its preconditions are satisfied. Existing research on foundational models' understanding of temporal execution is limited to automatically derived annotations, approximations of the TEO as a linear chain, or text-only inputs. To address this gap, we introduce MATEO (MultimodAl Temporal Execution Order), a benchmark designed to assess and improve the temporal reasoning abilities of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) required for real-world planning. We acquire a high-quality professional multimodal recipe corpus, authored through a standardized editorial process that decomposes instructions into discrete steps, each paired with corresponding images.

Abdelwahed", "Felipe Meneguzzi Kin Max Piamolini Gusmao", "Joan Espasa"], "title": "Removing Planner Bias in Goal Recognition Through Multi-Plan Dataset Generation", "comment": null, "summary": "Autonomous agents require some form of goal and plan recognition to interact in multiagent settings. Unfortunately, all existing goal recognition datasets suffer from a systematical bias induced by the planning systems that generated them, namely heuristic-based forward search. This means that existing datasets lack enough challenge for more realistic scenarios (e.g., agents using different planners), which impacts the evaluation of goal recognisers with respect to using different planners for the same goal. In this paper, we propose a new method that uses top-k planning to generate multiple, different, plans for the same goal hypothesis, yielding benchmarks that mitigate the bias found in the current dataset. This allows us to introduce a new metric called Version Coverage Score (VCS) to measure the resilience of the goal recogniser when inferring a goal based on different sets of plans. Our results show that the resilience of the current state-of-the-art goal recogniser degrades substantially under low observability settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc778\uc2dd \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc758 \ud3b8\ud5a5 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc778\uc2dd \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc740 \uacc4\ud68d \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\ubc1c\ub41c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc774 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\uc81c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0 \uc801\ud569\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc0c1\uc704-k \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \ubaa9\ud45c \uac00\uc124\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5ec\ub7ec \uac1c\uc758 \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uac00 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud55c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0, \ubaa9\ud45c \uc778\uc2dd\uae30\uac00 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uacc4\ud68d \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ucd94\ub860\ud560 \ub54c\uc758 \ud68c\ubcf5\ub825\uc744 \uce21\uc815\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 Version Coverage Score(VCS)\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc778\uc2dd\uae30\ub294 \ub0ae\uc740 \uad00\uce21 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc800\ud558\ub428\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc5b4\ub5a4 \ud615\ud0dc\uc758 \ubaa9\ud45c \ubc0f \uacc4\ud68d \uc778\uc2dd\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \ubd88\ud589\ud788\ub3c4, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc778\uc2dd \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc740 \uadf8\uac83\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c \uacc4\ud68d \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc778 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1 \uae30\ubc18 \uc804\ubc29 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc720\ub3c4\ub41c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc774 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624(\uc608: \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \uacc4\ud68d\uae30\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc758\ubbf8\ud558\uba70, \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uacc4\ud68d\uae30\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \ub54c \ubaa9\ud45c \uc778\uc2dd\uae30\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce5c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc0c1\uc704-k \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \ubaa9\ud45c \uac00\uc124\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5ec\ub7ec \uac1c\uc758 \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ud604\uc7ac \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uacac\ub41c \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud574\uc900\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uacc4\ud68d \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ucd94\ub860\ud560 \ub54c \ubaa9\ud45c \uc778\uc2dd\uae30\uc758 \ud68c\ubcf5\ub825\uc744 \uce21\uc815\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 Version Coverage Score(VCS)\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc778\uc2dd\uae30\uac00 \ub0ae\uc740 \uad00\uce21 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc800\ud558\ub428\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4."}}

Stadie"], "title": "Evolutionary System Prompt Learning can Facilitate Reinforcement Learning for LLMs", "comment": null, "summary": "Building agentic systems that can autonomously self-improve from experience is a longstanding goal of AI. Large language models (LLMs) today primarily self-improve via two mechanisms: self-reflection for context updates, and reinforcement learning (RL) for weight updates. In this work, we propose Evolutionary System Prompt Learning (E-SPL), a method for jointly improving model contexts and model weights. In each RL iteration, E-SPL selects multiple system prompts and runs rollouts with each in parallel. It applies RL updates to model weights conditioned on each system prompt, and evolutionary updates to the system prompt population via LLM-driven mutation and crossover. Each system prompt has a TrueSkill rating for evolutionary selection, updated from relative performance within each RL iteration batch. E-SPL encourages a natural division between declarative knowledge encoded in prompts and procedural knowledge encoded in weights, resulting in improved performance across reasoning and agentic tasks. For instance, in an easy-to-hard (AIME $\\rightarrow$ BeyondAIME) generalization setting, E-SPL improves RL success rate from 38.8% $\\rightarrow$ 45.1% while also outperforming reflective prompt evolution (40.0%). Overall, our results show that coupling reinforcement learning with system prompt evolution yields consistent gains in sample efficiency and generalization.

StarCraft II (SC2), with its massive state-action space and partial observability, is a challenging testbed. However, existing LLM-based SC2 agents primarily focus on improving the policy itself and overlook integrating a learnable, action-conditioned transition model into the decision loop. To bridge this gap, we propose StarWM, the first world model for SC2 that predicts future observations under partial observability. To facilitate learning SC2's hybrid dynamics, we introduce a structured textual representation that factorizes observations into five semantic modules, and construct SC2-Dynamics-50k, the first instruction-tuning dataset for SC2 dynamics prediction. We further develop a multi-dimensional offline evaluation framework for predicted structured observations. Offline results show StarWM's substantial gains over zero-shot baselines, including nearly 60% improvements in resource prediction accuracy and self-side macro-situation consistency. Finally, we propose StarWM-Agent, a world-model-augmented decision system that integrates StarWM into a Generate--Simulate--Refine decision loop for foresight-driven policy refinement. Online evaluation against SC2's built-in AI demonstrates consistent improvements, yielding win-rate gains of 30%, 15%, and 30% against Hard (LV5), Harder (LV6), and VeryHard (LV7), respectively, alongside improved macro-management stability and tactical risk assessment.", "AI": {"tldr": "StarWM\uc740 StarCraft II\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd80\ubd84 \uad00\uce21 \ud558\uc758 \ubbf8\ub798 \uad00\uce21\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c, \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud45c\ud604\uacfc SC2-Dynamics-50k \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, StarWM-Agent\ub294 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \ub8e8\ud504\uc5d0 StarWM\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\ucc45 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ucd94\uc9c4\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM\uc758 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uc815\ucc45\uc73c\ub85c\uc11c\uc758 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \ubaa8\uc0c9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubd80\ubd84 \uad00\uce21 \ud558\uc758 \ubbf8\ub798 \uad00\uce21\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 StarWM\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, SC2 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud55c SC2-Dynamics-50k \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uacfc \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 StarWM\uc774 \uc790\uc6d0 \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc5d0\uc11c 60% \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uc5ec \uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7 \uae30\uc900\uc120 \ub300\ube44 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "SC2\uc758 \ub0b4\uc7a5 AI\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ucc45 \uac1c\uc120\uc774 \ub098\ud0c0\ub098\uba70, Hard, Harder, VeryHard \ub09c\uc774\ub3c4\uc5d0\uc11c \uac01\uac01 30%, 15%, 30%\uc758 \uc2b9\ub960 \uc99d\uac00\ub97c \uae30\ub85d\ud558\uace0, \ub9e4\ud06c\ub85c \uad00\ub9ac \uc548\uc815\uc131 \ubc0f \uc804\uc220\uc801 \uc704\ud5d8 \ud3c9\uac00\uac00 \uac1c\uc120\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc740 \ucd5c\uadfc \uac15\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5b4 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \uc815\ucc45\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc0c1\ud0dc-\ud589\ub3d9 \uacf5\uac04\uacfc \ubd80\ubd84\uc801 \uad00\uce21\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 StarCraft II(SC2)\ub294 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc778 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud658\uacbd\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874\uc758 LLM \uae30\ubc18 SC2 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc8fc\ub85c \uc815\ucc45 \uc790\uccb4 \uac1c\uc120\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uace0, \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \ub8e8\ud504\uc5d0 \ud559\uc2b5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc561\uc158 \uc870\uac74 \uc804\uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uac04\uacfc\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \uba54\uc6b0\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubd80\ubd84 \uad00\uce21 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \ubbf8\ub798 \uad00\uce21\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 SC2\uc758 \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc778 StarWM\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

In enterprise settings, however, explicit control of both the frontend and backend is available. We present EmbeWebAgent, a framework for embedding agents directly into existing UIs using lightweight frontend hooks (curated ARIA and URL-based observations, and a per-page function registry exposed via a WebSocket) and a reusable backend workflow that performs reasoning and takes actions. EmbeWebAgent is stack-agnostic (e.g., React or Angular), supports mixed-granularity actions ranging from GUI primitives to higher-level composites, and orchestrates navigation, manipulation, and domain-specific analytics via MCP tools. Our demo shows minimal retrofitting effort and robust multi-step behaviors grounded in a live UI setting.

Training Data Attribution (TDA) methods address this by estimating datapoint influence. Existing approaches like influence functions are both computationally expensive and attribute based on single test examples, which can bias results toward syntactic rather than semantic similarity. To address these issues of scalability and influence to abstract behavior, we leverage interpretable structures within the model during the attribution. First, we introduce Concept Influence which attribute model behavior to semantic directions (such as linear probes or sparse autoencoder features) rather than individual test examples. Second, we show that simple probe-based attribution methods are first-order approximations of Concept Influence that achieve comparable performance while being over an order-of-magnitude faster. We empirically validate Concept Influence and approximations across emergent misalignment benchmarks and real post-training datasets, and demonstrate they achieve comparable performance to classical influence functions while being substantially more scalable. More broadly, we show that incorporating interpretable structure within traditional TDA pipelines can enable more scalable, explainable, and better control of model behavior through data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \ud2b9\uc815 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \ud2b9\uc815 \ud589\ub3d9, \ud2b9\ud788 \uc758\ub3c4\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc720\ubc1c\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubaa8\ub378 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8\uc758 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ucd94\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "Concept Influence\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uae30\ubc95\uc774 \uae30\uc874\uc758 Influence Functions\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud6e8\uc52c \ub354 \ube60\ub974\uace0 \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uae30\uc874 TDA \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc5d0 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c \ub354 \uc798 \uc81c\uc5b4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc774 \ud6c8\ub828\ub418\uace0 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ub428\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc2e4\ubb34\uc790\ub4e4\uc740 \ud2b9\uc815 \ud589\ub3d9, \ud2b9\ud788 \uc758\ub3c4\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc720\ubc1c\ud558\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uadc0\uc18d(TDA) \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8\uc758 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ucd94\uc815\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc601\ud5a5 \ud568\uc218\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4e4\uace0 \uac1c\ubcc4 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc608\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uadc0\uc18d\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc5ec \uad6c\ubb38\uc801 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uacb0\uacfc\uac00 \ud3b8\ud5a5\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5\uc131 \ubc0f \ucd94\uc0c1 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8e8\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uadc0\uc18d\ud558\ub294 \ub3d9\uc548 \ubaa8\ub378 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4. \uccab\uc9f8, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uac1c\ubcc4 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc608\uc81c\ubcf4\ub2e4\ub294 \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \ubc29\ud5a5(\uc608: \uc120\ud615 \ud504\ub85c\ube0c \ub610\ub294 \ud76c\uc18c \uc790\ub3d9 \uc778\ucf54\ub354 \ud2b9\uc9d5)\uc5d0 \uadc0\uc18d\ud558\ub294 Concept Influence\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub458\uc9f8, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \ud504\ub85c\ube0c \uae30\ubc18 \uadc0\uc18d \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 Concept Influence\uc758 1\ucc28 \uadfc\uc0ac\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc720\uc0ac\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uba87 \ubc30 \ube60\ub974\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub4f1\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc640 \uc2e4\uc81c \ud6c4\ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 Concept Influence\uc640 \uadf8 \uadfc\uc0ac\ub97c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\ud6a8\uc131\uc774 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub4e4\uc774 \uace0\uc804\uc801\uc778 \uc601\ud5a5 \ud568\uc218\uc640 \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \ud6e8\uc52c \ub354 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub113\uac8c\ub294, \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 TDA \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \ub0b4\uc5d0 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ub354 \uc798 \uc81c\uc5b4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4."}}

We argue instead that robust reasoning emerges from linguistic self-reflection, itself internalized from high-quality social interaction. Drawing on Vygotskian developmental psychology, we advance three core positions centered on Introspection. First, we argue for the Social Genesis of the Private Mind: learning from conversational environments rises to prominence as a new way to make sense of the world; the friction of aligning with another agent, internal or not, refines and crystallizes the reasoning process. Second, we argue that dialogically scaffolded introspective experiences allow agents to engage in sense-making that decouples learning from immediate data streams, transforming raw environmental data into rich, learnable narratives. Finally, we contend that Dialogue Quality is the New Data Quality: the depth of an agent's private reasoning, and its efficiency regarding test-time compute, is determined by the diversity and rigor of the dialogues it has mastered. We conclude that optimizing these conversational scaffolds is the primary lever for the next generation of general intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 AI \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c, \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ucd94\ub860\uc774 \uc5b8\uc5b4\uc801 \uc790\uae30 \ubc18\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd9c\ud604\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \uc0ac\ud68c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c \ub0b4\uba74\ud654\ub41c\ub2e4\uace0 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AI \ud6c8\ub828\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud788 \uaddc\ubaa8\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub85c \ubcf4\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0, \uc5b8\uc5b4\uc801 \uc790\uae30 \ubc18\uc131\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uacfc\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \uc7ac\uc815\uc758\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud568.", "method": "Vygotskian \ubc1c\ub2ec \uc2ec\ub9ac\ud559\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uc5ec \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud575\uc2ec \uc785\uc7a5\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \ub300\ud654\uac00 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc9c0\ub294 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud568.", "result": "\ub300\ud654\uac00 \uc0b6\uc758 \uc9c8\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc694\uc18c\ub85c \uc791\uc6a9\ud558\uba70, \uace0\ud488\uc9c8\uc758 \ub300\ud654 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc774 \uac1c\uc778\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \uc2ec\ub3c4\uc758 \uae4a\uc774\uc640 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uacb0\uc815\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90c.", "conclusion": "\uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub300\ud654\uc801 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ucc28\uc138\ub300 \uc77c\ubc18 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc8fc\uc694 \uc218\ub2e8\uc784\uc744 \uacb0\ub860\uc9c0\uc74c.", "translated_summary": "\ud604\uc7ac AI \ud6c8\ub828\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uaddc\ubaa8\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub85c \uac04\uc8fc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ucd94\ub860\uc774 \uc5b8\uc5b4\uc801 \uc790\uae30 \ubc18\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \ub098\ud0c0\ub098\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ub0b4\uba74\ud654\ub41c \uac83\uc774\ub77c\uace0 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

While artificial intelligence (AI) is being employed to advance AMP discovery and design, most AMP design models struggle to balance key goals like activity, toxicity, and novelty, using rigid or unclear scoring methods that make results hard to interpret and optimize. As the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLM) advance and evolve swiftly, we turn to AI multi-agent collaboration based on such models (multi-agent LLMs), which show rapidly rising potential in complex scientific design scenarios. Based on this, we introduce MAC-AMP, a closed-loop multi-agent collaboration (MAC) system for multi-objective AMP design. The system implements a fully autonomous simulated peer review-adaptive reinforcement learning framework that requires only a task description and example dataset to design novel AMPs. The novelty of our work lies in introducing a closed-loop multi-agent system for AMP design, with cross-domain transferability, that supports multi-objective optimization while remaining explainable rather than a 'black box'. Experiments show that MAC-AMP outperforms other AMP generative models by effectively optimizing AMP generation for multiple key molecular properties, demonstrating exceptional results in antibacterial activity, AMP likeliness, toxicity compliance, and structural reliability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub2e4\ubaa9\uc801 \ud56d\uade0 \ud3a9\ud0c0\uc774\ub4dc(AMP) \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \uc704\ud55c MAC-AMP\ub77c\ub294 \ub2eb\ud78c \ub8e8\ud504 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud611\uc5c5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5\uc774 AMP \ubc1c\uacac\uacfc \uc124\uacc4\uc5d0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud56d\ubbf8\uc0dd\ubb3c \ub0b4\uc131\uc758 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uac74\uac15 \uc704\ud611\uc5d0 \ub300\uc751\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud56d\uade0 \ud3a9\ud0c0\uc774\ub4dc\uc758 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "MAC-AMP\ub77c\ub294 \uc790\uc728 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ub3d9\ub8cc \uac80\ud1a0 \uc801\uc751 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c \ub2e4\ubaa9\uc801 AMP \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "MAC-AMP\ub294 \ub2e4\uc218\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec \ubd84\uc790 \ud2b9\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 AMP \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\ub978 AMP \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "MAC-AMP\ub294 \uc124\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uba70 \ub2e4\ubaa9\uc801 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc73c\ub85c, \ud56d\uade0 \ud65c\uc131, AMP \uc720\uc0ac\uc131, \ub3c5\uc131 \uc900\uc218 \ubc0f \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud56d\ubbf8\uc0dd\ubb3c \ub0b4\uc131\uc758 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uac74\uac15 \uc704\ud611\uc5d0 \ub300\uc751\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud56d\uade0 \ud3a9\ud0c0\uc774\ub4dc(AMP)\uc758 \uac15\ub825\ud558\uace0 \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uc800\ud56d\uc131 \ubcd1\uc6d0\uccb4\uc640 \uc2f8\uc6b0\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5(AI)\uc774 AMP \ubc1c\uacac \ubc0f \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \ubc1c\uc804\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 AMP \uc124\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ud574\uc11d \ubc0f \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \uacbd\uc9c1\ub418\uac70\ub098 \ubd88\uba85\ud655\ud55c \uc810\uc218 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud65c\ub3d9\uc131, \ub3c5\uc131 \ubc0f \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uac83\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc8fc\uc694 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uade0\ud615 \uc788\uac8c \ub9de\ucd94\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \uc2e0\uc18d\ud558\uac8c \ubc1c\uc804\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378(\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 LLM)\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c AI \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud611\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \ub208\uc744 \ub3cc\ub9ac\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \uc124\uacc4 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \ube60\ub974\uac8c \uc0c1\uc2b9\ud558\ub294 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e4\ubaa9\uc801 AMP \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ub2eb\ud78c \ub8e8\ud504 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud611\uc5c5(MAC) \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc778 MAC-AMP\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ud601\uc2e0\uc801\uc778 AMP\ub97c \uc124\uacc4\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5 \uc124\uba85 \ubc0f \uc608\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c \uc644\uc804 \uc790\uc728 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ub3d9\ub8cc \uac80\ud1a0 \uc801\uc751 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uad6c\ud604\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \ud601\uc2e0\uc810\uc740 '\ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4'\uac00 \uc544\ub2cc \uc124\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub2e4\ubaa9\uc801 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 AMP \uc124\uacc4\uc6a9 \ub2eb\ud78c \ub8e8\ud504 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, MAC-AMP\ub294 \ud56d\uade0 \ud65c\uc131, AMP \uc720\uc0ac\uc131, \ub3c5\uc131 \uc900\uc218 \ubc0f \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \ub2e4\ub978 AMP \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c AMP \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Recent data suggests that over 85% of patent filings originate outside the U.S., with China accounting for nearly half of the global total. A growing share of scholarly output is also non-U.S. Industry estimates put China at 30% of global drug development, spanning 1,200+ novel candidates. In this high-stakes environment, failing to surface \"under-the-radar\" assets creates multi-billion-dollar risk for investors and business development teams, making asset scouting a coverage-critical competition where speed and completeness drive value. Yet today's Deep Research AI agents still lag human experts in achieving high recall discovery across heterogeneous, multilingual sources without hallucination. We propose a benchmarking methodology for drug asset scouting and a tuned, tree-based self-learning Bioptic Agent aimed at complete, non-hallucinated scouting. We construct a challenging completeness benchmark using a multilingual multi-agent pipeline: complex user queries paired with ground-truth assets that are largely outside U.S.-centric radar. To reflect real-deal complexity, we collected screening queries from expert investors, BD, and VC professionals and used them as priors to conditionally generate benchmark queries. For grading, we use LLM-as-judge evaluation calibrated to expert opinions. On this benchmark, our Bioptic Agent achieves 79.7% F1 score, outperforming Claude Opus 4.6 (56.2%), Gemini 3 Pro + Deep Research (50.6%), OpenAI GPT-5.2 Pro (46.6%), Perplexity Deep Research (44.2%), and Exa Websets (26.9%).

However, many of these methods rely on rigid heuristics that fail to generalize across tasks and modalities. Here, we propose a novel framework for UQ that is highly flexible and approaches or surpasses the performance of prior heuristic methods. We introduce Directional Concentration Uncertainty (DCU), a novel statistical procedure for quantifying the concentration of embeddings based on the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution. Our method captures uncertainty by measuring the geometric dispersion of multiple generated outputs from a language model using continuous embeddings of the generated outputs without any task specific heuristics. In our experiments, we show that DCU matches or exceeds calibration levels of prior works like semantic entropy (Kuhn et al., 2023) and also generalizes well to more complex tasks in multi-modal domains. We present a framework for the wider potential of DCU and its implications for integration into UQ for multi-modal and agentic frameworks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubc29\ud5a5 \uc9d1\uc911 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131(DCU)\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud1b5\uacc4 \uc808\ucc28\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uacfc \uacac\uace0\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\ub294 \uc720\uc5f0\ud55c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uace0 \uacac\uace0\ud558\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4e4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654(UQ) \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131.", "method": "\ubc29\ud5a5 \uc9d1\uc911 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131(DCU)\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud1b5\uacc4 \uc808\ucc28\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec vMF \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc758 \uc9d1\uc911\uc744 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "DCU\ub294 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ubcf4\uc815 \uc218\uc900\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uac70\ub098 \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\uba70, \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\ub3c4 \uc798 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub41c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "DCU\uc758 \ub354 \ub113\uc740 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uacfc \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ubc0f \ud589\ub3d9 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0 UQ \ud1b5\ud569\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud568\uc758\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uace0 \uacac\uace0\ud558\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4e4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654(UQ) \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc774 \uace0\ubb34\uc801\uc778 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uae30 \uc2dc\uc791\ud588\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95 \uc911 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc218\uac00 \uc791\uc5c5 \ubc0f \uc591\uc2dd\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc9c1\ub41c \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc5ec\uae30\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc720\uc5f0\uc131\uc774 \ub192\uace0 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0 \uc811\uadfc\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc774\ub97c \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\ub294 UQ\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 von Mises-Fisher (vMF) \ubd84\ud3ec\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uc5ec \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc758 \uc9d1\uc911\uc744 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud1b5\uacc4 \uc808\ucc28\uc778 \ubc29\ud5a5 \uc9d1\uc911 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131(DCU)\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc758 \uc5f0\uc18d\uc131\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \uc5ec\ub7ec \ucd9c\ub825\uc758 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \ubd84\uc0b0\uc744 \uce21\uc815\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, DCU\ub294 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uae30\uc874 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \ubcf4\uc815 \uc218\uc900\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucd94\uac70\ub098 \uc774\ub97c \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\uba70, \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \ub354 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uc798 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub428\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 DCU\uc758 \ub354 \ub113\uc740 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uacfc \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ubc0f \ud589\ub3d9 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0 UQ \ud1b5\ud569\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud568\uc758\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

The key challenge is auditable coordination among specialised humans, robots, and digital services in a safety-critical system-of-systems. We introduce Agent Mars, an open, end-to-end multi-agent simulation framework for Mars base operations. Agent Mars formalises a realistic organisation with a 93-agent roster across seven layers of command and execution (human roles and physical assets), enabling base-scale studies beyond toy settings. It implements hierarchical and cross-layer coordination that preserves chain-of-command while allowing vetted cross-layer exchanges with audit trails; supports dynamic role handover with automatic failover under outages; and enables phase-dependent leadership for routine operations, emergencies, and science campaigns. Agent Mars further models mission-critical mechanisms-scenario-aware short/long-horizon memory, configurable propose-vote consensus, and translator-mediated heterogeneous protocols-to capture how teams align under stress. To quantify behaviour, we propose the Agent Mars Performance Index (AMPI), an interpretable composite score with diagnostic sub-metrics. Across 13 reproducible Mars-relevant operational scripts, Agent Mars reveals coordination trade-offs and identifies regimes where curated cross-layer collaboration and functional leadership reduce overhead without sacrificing reliability. Agent Mars provides a benchmarkable, auditable foundation for Space AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI\ub294 \ub85c\ubd07\uacf5\ud559\uacfc \uc6b0\uc8fc \ud0d0\uc0ac \ub4f1 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0 \ud601\uc2e0\uc744 \uac00\uc838\uc654\uc73c\uba70, \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud654\uc131 \uae30\uc9c0 \uc6b4\uc601\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Agent Mars\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc6b0\uc8fc \ud0d0\uc0ac\uc640 \uc815\ucc29\uc740 \uc9c0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uacbd\ud5d8\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \uc548\uc804\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc804\ubb38\ud654\ub41c \uc778\uac04, \ub85c\ubd07, \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uac04\uc758 \uc870\uc815\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "Agent Mars\ub294 93\uba85\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c 7\uacc4\uce35\uc758 \uba85\ub839 \ubc0f \uc2e4\ud589 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc6b4\uc601\uc744 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud558\uba70, \uacc4\uce35 \uac04 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \ub69c\ub837\ud55c \uac10\uc0ac \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "Agent Mars\ub294 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \uc800\ud558\uc2dc\ud0a4\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud611\uc5c5\uacfc \uae30\ub2a5\uc801 \ub9ac\ub354\uc2ed\uc774 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Agent Mars\ub294 \uc6b0\uc8fc AI\uc758 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \ub9c8\ub828\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5(AI)\uc740 \ub85c\ubd07\uacf5\ud559, \uc758\ub8cc, \uc0b0\uc5c5 \ubc0f \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \ubcc0\ud654\uc2dc\ucf30\uc73c\ub098, \uc8fc\uc694\ud55c \uacbd\uacc4\ub294 \uc9c0\uad6c \ub108\uba38\uc5d0 \uc788\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc6b0\uc8fc \ud0d0\uc0ac \ubc0f \uc815\ucc29\uc740 \ubc29\ub300\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uacfc \uc790\uc6d0\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc9c0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uacbd\ud5d8\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ubd80\uacfc\ud55c\ub2e4: \uc9c0\uc5f0\ub41c/\uac04\ud5d0\uc801\uc778 \ud1b5\uc2e0, \uadf9\ub3c4\uc758 \uc790\uc6d0 \ubd80\uc871, \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc804\ubb38\uc131, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \uc548\uc804, \ucc45\uc784 \ubc0f \uba85\ub839 \uad8c\ud55c. \uc8fc\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub294 \uc548\uc804-\uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c-\uc758 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc804\ubb38\ud654\ub41c \uc778\uac04, \ub85c\ubd07, \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uac04\uc758 \uac10\uc0ac \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc870\uc815\uc774\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud654\uc131 \uae30\uc9c0 \uc6b4\uc601\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uac1c\ubc29\ud615, \uc885\ub2e8 \uac04 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Agent Mars\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.

However, most existing methods rely on restrictive assumptions, such as a fixed number of agents and fully synchronous action execution. These assumptions are often violated in urban systems, where the number of active agents varies over time, and actions may have heterogeneous durations, resulting in a semi-MARL setting. Moreover, while sharing policy parameters among agents is commonly adopted to improve learning efficiency, it can lead to highly homogeneous actions when a subset of agents make decisions concurrently under similar observations, potentially degrading coordination quality. To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive Value Decomposition (AVD), a cooperative MARL framework that adapts to a dynamically changing agent population. AVD further incorporates a lightweight mechanism to mitigate action homogenization induced by shared policies, thereby encouraging behavioral diversity and maintaining effective cooperation among agents.

However, their simplicity often limits their utility for distinguishing between advanced neural network architectures. To address these challenges, Greydanus et al. introduced the MNIST-1D dataset, a one-dimensional adaptation of MNIST designed to explore inductive biases in sequential data. This dataset maintains the advantages of small-scale datasets while introducing variability and complexity that make it ideal for studying advanced architectures.\n  In this paper, we extend the exploration of MNIST-1D by evaluating the performance of Residual Networks (ResNet), Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN), and Dilated Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN). These models, known for their ability to capture sequential patterns and hierarchical features, were implemented and benchmarked alongside previously tested architectures such as logistic regression, MLPs, CNNs, and GRUs. Our experimental results demonstrate that advanced architectures like TCN and DCNN consistently outperform simpler models, achieving near-human performance on MNIST-1D. ResNet also shows significant improvements, highlighting the importance of leveraging inductive biases and hierarchical feature extraction in small structured datasets.\n  Through this study, we validate the utility of MNIST-1D as a robust benchmark for evaluating machine learning architectures under computational constraints.

We propose G2CP (Graph-Grounded Communication Protocol), a structured agent communication language where messages are graph operations rather than free text. Agents exchange explicit traversal commands, subgraph fragments, and update operations over a shared knowledge graph, enabling verifiable reasoning traces and eliminating ambiguity. We validate G2CP within an industrial knowledge management system where specialized agents (Diagnostic, Procedural, Synthesis, and Ingestion) coordinate to answer complex queries. Experimental results on 500 industrial scenarios and 21 real-world maintenance cases show that G2CP reduces inter-agent communication tokens by 73%, improves task completion accuracy by 34% over free-text baselines, eliminates cascading hallucinations, and produces fully auditable reasoning chains.

Until recently, the implementation of security measures in DevOps environments was often considered optional by many government entities and critical national services operating in the cloud. This includes systems managing sensitive information, such as electoral processes or military operations, which have historically been valuable targets for cybercriminals. Resistance to security implementation is often driven by concerns over losing agility in software development, increasing the risk of accumulated vulnerabilities. Nowadays, patching software is no longer enough; adopting a proactive cyber defense strategy, supported by Artificial Intelligence (AI), is crucial to anticipating and mitigating threats. Thus, this work proposes integrating the Security Chaos Engineering (SCE) methodology with a new LLM-based flow to automate the creation of attack defense trees that represent adversary behavior and facilitate the construction of SCE experiments based on these graphical models, enabling teams to stay one step ahead of attackers and implement previously unconsidered defenses.

This abstraction introduces an under-measured attack surface: skill-based prompt injection, where poisoned skills can steer agents away from user intent and safety policies. In practice, naive injections often fail because the malicious intent is too explicit or drifts too far from the original skill, leading agents to ignore or refuse them; existing attacks are also largely hand-crafted. We propose the first automated framework for stealthy prompt injection tailored to agent skills. The framework forms a closed loop with three agents: an Attack Agent that synthesizes injection skills under explicit stealth constraints, a Code Agent that executes tasks using the injected skills in a realistic tool environment, and an Evaluate Agent that logs action traces (e.g., tool calls and file operations) and verifies whether targeted malicious behaviors occurred. We also propose a malicious payload hiding strategy that conceals adversarial operations in auxiliary scripts while injecting optimized inducement prompts to trigger tool execution. Extensive experiments across diverse coding-agent settings and real-world software engineering tasks show that our method consistently achieves high attack success rates under realistic settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\uc220 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc8fc\uc785 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\uc220\uc774 \ub3c4\uad6c \ubcf4\uac15 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\uc5b4 \ud575\uc2ec \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654\uac00 \ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc74c\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \uae30\uc220 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc8fc\uc785 \uacf5\uaca9\uc740 \uc798 \uce21\uc815\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uacf5\uaca9 \ud45c\uba74\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801 \uc740\ud3d0 \uc81c\uc57d \uc870\uac74 \ud558\uc5d0 \uc8fc\uc785 \uae30\uc220\uc744 \ud569\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8, \uc8fc\uc785\ub41c \uae30\uc220\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud574 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uad6c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc2e4\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8, \ud589\ub3d9 \ucd94\uc801\uc744 \uae30\ub85d\ud558\uace0 \ubaa9\ud45c\ud55c \uc545\uc758\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9\uc758 \ubc1c\uc0dd \uc5ec\ubd80\ub97c \uac80\uc99d\ud558\ub294 \ud3c9\uac00 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \ud3d0\uc1c4 \ub8e8\ud504 \uad6c\uc870\uc758 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ucf54\ub529 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud658\uacbd\uacfc \uc2e4\uc81c \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uacf5\ud559 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \ud3ed\ub113\uc740 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c consistently \ub192\uc740 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uae30\uc220 \uae30\ubc18 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc8fc\uc785 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \uad00\ub9ac\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\uc220\uc740 \uc7a5\ubb38\uc758 \uc9c0\uce68\uacfc \ubcf4\uc870 \uc2a4\ud06c\ub9bd\ud2b8\ub97c \ud328\ud0a4\uc9d5\ud558\uc5ec \ub3c4\uad6c \ubcf4\uac15 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \ucf54\ub529 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654\uac00 \ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774 \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc758\ub3c4\uc640 \uc548\uc804 \uc815\ucc45\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc774\ud0c8\ud558\uac8c \ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc624\uc5fc\ub41c \uae30\uc220\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c \uae30\uc220 \uae30\ubc18 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc8fc\uc785\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc798 \uce21\uc815\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uacf5\uaca9 \ud45c\uba74\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc2e4\uc81c\ub85c, \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \uc8fc\uc785\uc740 \uc545\uc758\uc801 \uc758\ub3c4\uac00 \ub108\ubb34 \uba85\ud655\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc6d0\ub798 \uae30\uc220\uc5d0\uc11c \ub108\ubb34 \uba40\uc5b4\uc838 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc774\ub97c \ubb34\uc2dc\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uac70\ubd80\ud558\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc885\uc885 \uc2e4\ud328\ud55c\ub2e4;
