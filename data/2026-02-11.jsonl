Nevertheless, they still suffer from inherent limitations in resource efficiency, context management, and multimodal perception. Based on these observations, Lemon Agent is introduced, a multi-agent orchestrator-worker system built on a newly proposed AgentCortex framework, which formalizes the classic Planner-Executor-Memory paradigm through an adaptive task execution mechanism. Our system integrates a hierarchical self-adaptive scheduling mechanism that operates at both the overall orchestrator layer and workers layer. This mechanism can dynamically adjust computational intensity based on task complexity. It enables orchestrator to allocate one or more workers for parallel subtask execution, while workers can further improve operational efficiency by invoking tools concurrently. By virtue of this two-tier architecture, the system achieves synergistic balance between global task coordination and local task execution, thereby optimizing resource utilization and task processing efficiency in complex scenarios. To reduce context redundancy and increase information density during parallel steps, we adopt a three-tier progressive context management strategy. To make fuller use of historical information, we propose a self-evolving memory system, which can extract multi-dimensional valid information from all historical experiences to assist in completing similar tasks. Furthermore, we provide an enhanced MCP toolset. Empirical evaluations on authoritative benchmarks demonstrate that our Lemon Agent can achieve a state-of-the-art 91.36% overall accuracy on GAIA and secures the top position on the xbench-DeepSearch leaderboard with a score of 77+."}

Existing methods lack principled mechanisms to detect or prevent such failures. To address this gap, we first propose a hierarchical metric that quantifies behavioral uncertainty at three levels: intra-agent (individual reasoning uncertainty), inter-agent (interactive uncertainty), and system-level (output uncertainty). Empirical analysis across several benchmarks reveals that our proposed uncertainty quantification reliably indicates system failures, which demonstrates the validity of using them as diagnostic metrics to indicate the system failure. Subsequently, we propose a mitigation strategy by formulating an uncertainty-driven policy optimization to penalize self-contradiction, peer conflict, and low-confidence outputs in a dynamic debating environment. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed uncertainty-driven mitigation reliably calibrates the multi-agent system by consistently improving decision accuracy while reducing system disagreement."}

However, individuals are inclined to defect in order to benefit from the group's cooperation without contributing the associated costs, thus leading to unfair situations. In game theory, social dilemmas entail this dichotomy between individual interest and collective outcome. The most dominant approach to multi-agent cooperation is the utilitarian welfare which can produce efficient highly inequitable outcomes. This paper proposes a novel framework to foster fairer cooperation by replacing the standard utilitarian objective with Proportional Fairness. We introduce a fair altruistic utility for each agent, defined on the individual log-payoff space and derive the analytical conditions required to ensure cooperation in classic social dilemmas. We then extend this framework to sequential settings by defining a Fair Markov Game and deriving novel fair Actor-Critic algorithms to learn fair policies.

Although recent multimodal large language models have shown strong performance on this task, two key challenges remain - spurious associations between emotions and irrelevant audiovisual cues, and hallucinations of audiovisual cues driven by text priors in the language model backbone. To quantify and understand these issues, we introduce EmoReAlM, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs for cue-emotion associations, hallucinations and modality agreement. We then propose AVEm-DPO, a preference optimization technique that aligns model responses with both audiovisual inputs and emotion-centric queries. Specifically, we construct preferences over responses exhibiting spurious associations or hallucinations, and audiovisual input pairs guided by textual prompts. We also include a regularization term that penalizes reliance on text priors, thereby mitigating modality-specific cue hallucinations. Experimental results on DFEW, RAVDESS and EMER demonstrate that our method significantly improves the performance of the reference baseline models with 6-19% of relative performance gains in zero-shot settings.

However, there is no systematic study on their effectiveness in autonomously reproducing Linux kernel vulnerabilities with concrete proofs-of-concept (PoCs). Owing to the size, complexity, and low-level nature of the Linux kernel, such tasks are widely regarded as particularly challenging for current LLM-based approaches.\n  In this paper, we present the first large-scale study of LLM-based Linux kernel vulnerability reproduction. For this purpose, we develop K-Repro, an LLM-based agentic system equipped with controlled code-browsing, virtual machine management, interaction, and debugging capabilities. Using kernel security patches as input, K-Repro automates end-to-end bug reproduction of N-day vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel. On a dataset of 100 real-world exploitable Linux kernel vulnerabilities collected from KernelCTF, our results show that K-Repro can generate PoCs that reproduce over 50\\% of the cases with practical time and monetary cost.\n  Beyond aggregate success rates, we perform an extensive study of effectiveness, efficiency, stability, and impact factors to explain when agentic reproduction succeeds, where it fails, and which components drive performance. These findings provide actionable guidance for building more reliable autonomous security agents and for assessing real-world N-day risk from both offensive and defensive perspectives."}

Meanwhile, despite the rapid advancement of Search Agents, their practical deployment is constrained by a fundamental limitation, termed as 1) Latency Challenge: the serial execution of multi-round reasoning, tool calling, and tool response waiting under the ReAct agent paradigm induces severe end-to-end latency. Intuitively, dLLMs can leverage their distinctive strengths to optimize the operational efficiency of agents under the ReAct agent paradigm. Practically, existing dLLM backbones face the 2) Agent Ability Challenge. That is, existing dLLMs exhibit remarkably weak reasoning and tool-calling capabilities, preventing these advantages from being effectively realized in practice. In this paper, we propose DLLM-Searcher, an optimization framework for dLLM-based Search Agents. To solve the Agent Ability Challenge, we design a two-stage post-training pipeline encompassing Agentic Supervised Fine-Tuning (Agentic SFT) and Agentic Variance-Reduced Preference Optimization Agentic VRPO, which enhances the backbone dLLM's information seeking and reasoning capabilities. To mitigate the Latency Challenge, we leverage the flexible generation mechanism of dLLMs and propose a novel agent paradigm termed Parallel-Reasoning and Acting P-ReAct. P-ReAct guides the model to prioritize decoding tool_call instructions, thereby allowing the model to keep thinking while waiting for the tool's return. Experimental results demonstrate that DLLM-Searcher achieves performance comparable to mainstream LLM-based search agents and P-ReAct delivers approximately 15% inference acceleration.

Our model creates music that is emotionally and rhythmically synchronized with the video. A core component of EMSYNC is a novel video emotion classifier. By leveraging pretrained deep neural networks for feature extraction and keeping them frozen while training only fusion layers, we reduce computational complexity while improving accuracy. We show the generalization abilities of our method by obtaining state-of-the-art results on Ekman-6 and MovieNet. Another key contribution is a large-scale, emotion-labeled MIDI dataset for affective music generation. We then present an emotion-based MIDI generator, the first to condition on continuous emotional values rather than discrete categories, enabling nuanced music generation aligned with complex emotional content. To enhance temporal synchronization, we introduce a novel temporal boundary conditioning method, called \"boundary offset encodings,\" aligning musical chords with scene changes. Combining video emotion classification, emotion-based music generation, and temporal boundary conditioning, EMSYNC emerges as a fully automatic video-based music generator. User studies show that it consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of music richness, emotional alignment, temporal synchronization, and overall preference, setting a new state-of-the-art in video-based music generation."}

ValueFlow introduces a 56-value evaluation dataset derived from the Schwartz Value Survey and quantifies agents' value orientations during interaction using an LLM-as-a-judge protocol. Building on this measurement layer, ValueFlow decomposes value drift into agent-level response behavior and system-level structural effects, operationalized by two metrics: beta-susceptibility, which measures an agent's sensitivity to perturbed peer signals, and system susceptibility (SS), which captures how node-level perturbations affect final system outputs.

Aegis models the realistic deployment pipeline of voice agents and designs structured adversarial scenarios of critical risks, including privacy leakage, privilege escalation, resource abuse, etc. We evaluate the framework through case studies in banking call centers, IT Support, and logistics. Our evaluation shows that while access controls mitigate data-level risks, voice agents remain vulnerable to behavioral attacks that cannot be addressed through access restrictions alone, even under strict access controls. We observe systematic differences across model families, with open-weight models exhibiting higher susceptibility, underscoring the need for layered defenses that combine access control, policy enforcement, and behavioral monitoring to secure next-generation voice agents."}

Motivated by this problem, we repurpose a classical model in evolutionary game theory, i.e., the Brown-von Neumann-Nash (BNN) dynamics, by leveraging the intrinsic convergence of this dynamics in zero-sum games without regularization, and provide last-iterate convergence guarantees in noisy normal-form games (NFGs). Importantly, to make this approach more applicable, we develop a novel framework with theoretical guarantees that integrates the BNN dynamics in extensive-form games (EFGs) through counterfactual weighting.

LLM agents maintain working memory through their context window, which stores interaction history for decision-making. Conventional agents indiscriminately accumulate all tool outputs and reasoning traces in this memory, creating two critical vulnerabilities: (1) injected instructions persist throughout the workflow, granting attackers multiple opportunities to manipulate behavior, and (2) verbose, non-essential content degrades decision-making capabilities. Existing defenses treat bloated memory as given and focus on remaining resilient, rather than reducing unnecessary accumulation to prevent the attack.\n  We present AgentSys, a framework that defends against indirect prompt injection through explicit memory management. Inspired by process memory isolation in operating systems, AgentSys organizes agents hierarchically: a main agent spawns worker agents for tool calls, each running in an isolated context and able to spawn nested workers for subtasks. External data and subtask traces never enter the main agent's memory; only schema-validated return values can cross boundaries through deterministic JSON parsing. Ablations show isolation alone cuts attack success to 2.19%, and adding a validator/sanitizer further improves defense with event-triggered checks whose overhead scales with operations rather than context length.\n  On AgentDojo and ASB, AgentSys achieves 0.78% and 4.25% attack success while slightly improving benign utility over undefended baselines. It remains robust to adaptive attackers and across multiple foundation models, showing that explicit memory management enables secure, dynamic LLM agent architectures.

We propose Theory of Space, defined as an agent's ability to actively acquire information through self-directed, active exploration and to construct, revise, and exploit a spatial belief from sequential, partial observations. We evaluate this through a benchmark where the goal is curiosity-driven exploration to build an accurate cognitive map. A key innovation is spatial belief probing, which prompts models to reveal their internal spatial representations at each step. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals several critical bottlenecks. First, we identify an Active-Passive Gap, where performance drops significantly when agents must autonomously gather information. Second, we find high inefficiency, as models explore unsystematically compared to program-based proxies. Through belief probing, we diagnose that while perception is an initial bottleneck, global beliefs suffer from instability that causes spatial knowledge to degrade over time. Finally, using a false belief paradigm, we uncover Belief Inertia, where agents fail to update obsolete priors with new evidence. This issue is present in text-based agents but is particularly severe in vision-based models. Our findings suggest that current foundation models struggle to maintain coherent, revisable spatial beliefs during active exploration."}

Most papers report a pass@1 score computed from a single run per task, assuming this gives a reliable performance estimate. We test this assumption by collecting 60,000 agentic trajectories on SWE-Bench-Verified, spanning three models and two scaffolds. We find substantial variance: single-run pass@1 estimates vary by 2.2 to 6.0 percentage points depending on which run is selected, with standard deviations exceeding 1.5 percentage points even at temperature 0. This variance has critical implications: reported improvements of 2--3 percentage points may reflect evaluation noise rather than genuine algorithmic progress. Through token-level analysis, we show that trajectories diverge early, often within the first few percent of tokens, and that these small differences cascade into different solution strategies. To enable reliable evaluation of agentic systems, we recommend three concrete practices: (1) estimate pass@1 from multiple independent runs per task, especially when measuring small improvements, (2) use statistical power analysis to determine the number of runs needed to detect expected effect sizes, and (3) consider metrics like pass@k (optimistic bound) and pass^k (pessimistic bound) with k>1 to better characterize the full performance envelope.

This is motivated by well-known results in quantum physics which posit that, for certain single-round cooperative games with no communication, shared quantum entanglement enables strategies that outperform those that only use shared randomness. In such cases, we say that there is quantum advantage. Our framework is based on a novel differentiable policy parameterization that enables optimization over quantum measurements, together with a novel policy architecture that decomposes joint policies into a quantum coordinator and decentralized local actors. To illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we first show that we can learn, purely from experience, strategies that attain quantum advantage in single-round games that are treated as black box oracles. We then demonstrate how our machinery can learn policies with quantum advantage in an illustrative multi-agent sequential decision-making problem formulated as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP)."}

Differential testing scales well when implementations disagree, but it provides little signal when all implementations converge on the same incorrect interpretation of an ambiguous requirement. We present SPECA, a Specification-to-Checklist Auditing framework that turns normative requirements into checklists, maps them to implementation locations, and supports cross-implementation reuse.\n  We instantiate SPECA in an in-the-wild security audit contest for the Ethereum Fusaka upgrade, covering 11 production clients. Across 54 submissions, 17 were judged valid by the contest organizers. Cross-implementation checks account for 76.5 percent (13 of 17) of valid findings, suggesting that checklist-derived one-to-many reuse is a practical scaling mechanism in multi-implementation audits. To understand false positives, we manually coded the 37 invalid submissions and find that threat model misalignment explains 56.8 percent (21 of 37): reports that rely on assumptions about trust boundaries or scope that contradict the audit's rules. We detected no High or Medium findings in the V1 deployment; misses concentrated in specification details and implicit assumptions (57.1 percent), timing and concurrency issues (28.6 percent), and external library dependencies (14.3 percent). Our improved agent, evaluated against the ground truth of a competitive audit, achieved a strict recall of 27.3 percent on high-impact vulnerabilities, placing it in the top 4 percent of human auditors and outperforming 49 of 51 contestants on critical issues. These results, though from a single deployment, suggest that early, explicit threat modeling is essential for reducing false positives and focusing agentic auditing effort. The agent-driven process enables expert validation and submission in about 40 minutes on average."}

As a result, existing risk-sensitive model-free approaches are limited to simple tasks and tabular settings. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive theoretical justification for policy gradient methods on the entropic risk measure, including on- and off-policy gradient theorems for the stochastic and deterministic policy settings.

To address this gap, we propose Aegis, a red-teaming framework for the governance, integrity, and security of voice agents. Aegis models the realistic deployment pipeline of voice agents and designs structured adversarial scenarios of critical risks, including privacy leakage, privilege escalation, resource abuse, etc. We evaluate the framework through case studies in banking call centers, IT Support, and logistics. Our evaluation shows that while access controls mitigate data-level risks, voice agents remain vulnerable to behavioral attacks that cannot be addressed through access restrictions alone, even under strict access controls. We observe systematic differences across model families, with open-weight models exhibiting higher susceptibility, underscoring the need for layered defenses that combine access control, policy enforcement, and behavioral monitoring to secure next-generation voice agents."}

To support grounded prospective reflection, we distill planning errors from historical agent trajectories, capturing recurring success and failure patterns observed across past executions. Furthermore, we complement prospective reflection with a dynamic re-planning mechanism that provides execution-time plan update in case the original plan encounters unexpected deviation.

A particularly elegant way of interpreting SCMs is do-Shapley, a game-theoretic method of quantifying the average effect of $d$ variables across exponentially many interventions. Like Shapley values, computing do-Shapley values generally requires evaluating exponentially many terms. The foundation of our work is a reformulation of do-Shapley values in terms of the irreducible sets of the underlying SCM. Leveraging this insight, we can exactly compute do-Shapley values in time linear in the number of irreducible sets $r$, which itself can range from $d$ to $2^d$ depending on the graph structure of the SCM. Since $r$ is unknown a priori, we complement the exact algorithm with an estimator that, like general Shapley value estimators, can be run with any query budget. As the query budget approaches $r$, our estimators can produce more accurate estimates than prior methods by several orders of magnitude, and, when the budget reaches $r$, return the Shapley values up to machine precision. Beyond computational speed, we also reduce the identification burden: we prove that non-parametric identifiability of do-Shapley values requires only the identification of interventional effects for the $d$ singleton coalitions, rather than all classes."}

Using a two-parameter logistic Item Response Theory model, we jointly estimate latent task difficulty and model capability from model performance data across multiple benchmarks. We demonstrate that latent task difficulty varies linearly with the logarithm of human completion time, allowing human task completion time to be inferred for new benchmarks from model performance alone.

Yet in implicit-feedback, a single global temperature and equal treatment of uniformly sampled negatives can lead to brittle training, because sampled sets may contain varying degrees of relevant or informative competitors. The optimal loss sharpness for a user-item pair with a particular set of negatives, can be suboptimal or destabilising for another with different negatives. We introduce Dual-scale Softmax Loss (DSL), which infers effective sharpness from the sampled competition itself. DSL adds two complementary branches to the log-sum-exp backbone. Firstly it reweights negatives within each training instance using hardness and item--item similarity, secondly it adapts a per-example temperature from the competition intensity over a constructed competitor slate. Together, these components preserve the geometry of SL while reshaping the competition distribution across negatives and across examples.\n  Over several representative benchmarks and backbones, DSL yields substantial gains over strong baselines, with improvements over SL exceeding $10%$ in several settings and averaging $6.22%$ across datasets, metrics, and backbones. Under out-of-distribution (OOD) popularity shift, the gains are larger, with an average of $9.31%$ improvement over SL. We further provide a theoretical, distributionally robust optimisation (DRO) analysis, which demonstrates how DSL reshapes the robust payoff and the KL deviation for ambiguous instances.

Motivated by this, we present LINCSQA, a novel benchmark for predicting target gene regulation under complex chemical perturbations in bulk-cell environments.

This creates a distributional mismatch, leaving student models ill-equipped to recover from their own runtime failures. To bridge these gaps, we introduce TermiGen, an end-to-end pipeline for synthesizing verifiable environments and resilient expert trajectories.

This work explores a fundamental principle for enhancing generative models: treating retrieval as a form of dynamic in-context learning. We test an adaptive retrieval-augmented architecture where an LLM agent actively decides when to query an external knowledge base during its reasoning process. We compare this adaptive strategy against a standard Chain-of-Thought (CoT) baseline and a static retrieval approach on the GSM8K and MATH-500 benchmarks. Although our experiments show that static retrieval is inferior to CoT, the adaptive retrieval shows interesting behavior: While traces including retrieved results show slightly worse performance compared to CoT, traces that do not include retrieval actually perform better compared to CoT. This suggests that: (a) retrieval only rarely helps reasoning (we show a few counterexamples, e.g. using useful theorems) and (b) actively not using retrieval is indicative of good model performance. Furthermore, we find that the model scales its retrieval frequency with the difficulty of the problem, reinforcing that the decision to retrieve is a crucial metacognitive signal. The agent's ability to self-assess its knowledge and selectively engage with external information represents a key principle for building more robust and reliable generative models."}

Because LLM inference is inherently expensive, even modest slowdowns can translate into substantial operating costs and severe availability risks. Recently, a growing body of research has focused on algorithmic complexity attacks by crafting inputs to trigger worst-case output lengths. However, we report a counter-intuitive finding that these algorithmic latency attacks are largely ineffective against modern LLM serving systems. We reveal that system-level optimization such as continuous batching provides a logical isolation to mitigate contagious latency impact on co-located users. To this end, in this paper, we shift the focus from the algorithm to the system layer, and introduce a new Fill and Squeeze attack strategy targeting the state transition of the scheduler. \"Fill\" first exhausts the global KV cache to induce Head-of-Line blocking, while \"Squeeze\" forces the system into repetitive preemption. By manipulating output lengths using methods from simple plain-text prompts to more complex prompt engineering, and leveraging side-channel probing of memory status, we demonstrate that the attack can be orchestrated in a black-box setting with much less cost. Extensive evaluations indicate by up to 20-280x average slowdown on Time to First Token and 1.5-4x average slowdown on Time Per Output Token compared to existing attacks with 30-40% lower attack cost."}

In this work, we propose the Wide and Deep research agent, a framework designed to investigate the behavior and performance of agents when scaling not only depth but also width via parallel tool calling. Unlike existing approaches that rely on complex multi-agent orchestration to parallelize workloads, our method leverages intrinsic parallel tool calling to facilitate effective coordination within a single reasoning step. We demonstrate that scaling width significantly improves performance on deep research benchmarks while reducing the number of turns required to obtain correct answers. Furthermore, we analyze the factors driving these improvements through case studies and explore various tool call schedulers to optimize parallel tool calling strategy. Our findings suggest that optimizing the trade-off between width and depth is a critical pathway toward high-efficiency deep research agents.

However, existing GNNs often struggle with heterophilic graphs, where connected nodes tend to have dissimilar features or labels. While numerous methods have been proposed to address this challenge, they primarily focus on architectural designs without directly targeting the root cause of the heterophily problem. These approaches still perform even worse than the simplest MLPs on challenging heterophilic datasets. For instance, our experiments show that 21 latest GNNs still fall behind the MLP on the Actor dataset. This critical challenge calls for an innovative approach to addressing graph heterophily beyond architectural designs. To bridge this gap, we propose and study a new and unexplored paradigm: directly increasing the graph homophily via a carefully designed graph transformation. In this work, we present a simple yet effective framework called GRAPHITE to address graph heterophily. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first method that explicitly transforms the graph to directly improve the graph homophily. Stemmed from the exact definition of homophily, our proposed GRAPHITE creates feature nodes to facilitate homophilic message passing between nodes that share similar features. Furthermore, we both theoretically and empirically show that our proposed GRAPHITE significantly increases the homophily of originally heterophilic graphs, with only a slight increase in the graph size. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets demonstrate that our proposed GRAPHITE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on heterophilic graphs while achieving comparable accuracy with state-of-the-art methods on homophilic graphs."}

In this attack scenario, malicious commands hidden within untrusted content trick the agent into performing unauthorized actions. Existing defenses can reduce attack success but often suffer from the over-defense dilemma: they deploy expensive, always-on sanitization regardless of actual threat, thereby degrading utility and latency even in benign scenarios. We revisit IPI through a causal ablation perspective: a successful injection manifests as a dominance shift where the user request no longer provides decisive support for the agent's privileged action, while a particular untrusted segment, such as a retrieved document or tool output, provides disproportionate attributable influence. Based on this signature, we propose CausalArmor, a selective defense framework that (i) computes lightweight, leave-one-out ablation-based attributions at privileged decision points, and (ii) triggers targeted sanitization only when an untrusted segment dominates the user intent. Additionally, CausalArmor employs retroactive Chain-of-Thought masking to prevent the agent from acting on ``poisoned'' reasoning traces. We present a theoretical analysis showing that sanitization based on attribution margins conditionally yields an exponentially small upper bound on the probability of selecting malicious actions. Experiments on AgentDojo and DoomArena demonstrate that CausalArmor matches the security of aggressive defenses while improving explainability and preserving utility and latency of AI agents."}

By using model responses as a fitness signal, the framework iteratively compounds effective attack strategies while simultaneously ensuring \"benign-use correctness\", preventing the degenerate security of blanket refusal. Our experiments on Gemini 2.5 Flash demonstrate that evolutionary mutation systematically amplifies vulnerabilities missed by one-shot methods, with controlled ablations revealing that the synergy between exploration and targeted mutation uncovers high-severity failure modes.

Rather than exchanging feature-dependent statistics or relying on noise injection for privacy, agents cluster their local views independently and reconcile their proposals through identifier-level consensus. Consensus is achieved via decentralized ordinal ranking to select representative medoids, progressively inducing a shared hierarchical clustering across agents. Communication is limited to sample identifiers, cluster labels, and ordinal rankings, providing privacy by design while supporting overlapping feature partitions and heterogeneous local clustering methods, and yielding an interpretable shared Cluster Fusion Hierarchy (CFH) that captures cross-view agreement at multiple resolutions.We analyze communication complexity and robustness, and experiments demonstrate competitive clustering performance in vertical federated settings."}

Existing access control is static and centralized, unable to adapt to insider threats or evolving contexts. Blockchain improves decentralization but lacks behavioral intelligence, while centralized machine learning for anomaly detection requires aggregating sensitive data, violating privacy.\n  The proposed solution is ICBAC, an intelligent contract-based access control framework. It integrates permissioned blockchain (Hyperledger Fabric) with federated learning (FL). Built on Fabric, ICBAC uses a multi-channel architecture and three smart contracts for asset management, baseline access control, and dynamic revocation. To counter insider misuse, each channel deploys an AI agent that monitors activity and dynamically restricts access for anomalies. Federated learning allows these agents to collaboratively improve detection models without sharing raw data.\n  For heterogeneous, competitive environments, ICBAC introduces a game-theoretic client selection mechanism using hedonic coalition formation. This enables supply chains to form stable, strategy-proof FL coalitions via preference-based selection without disclosing sensitive criteria. Extensive experiments on a Fabric testbed with a real-world dataset show ICBAC achieves blockchain performance comparable to static frameworks and provides effective anomaly detection under IID and non-IID data with zero raw-data sharing. ICBAC thus offers a practical, scalable solution for dynamic, privacy-preserving access control in decentralized supply chains."}

We propose ShaPO, a geometry-aware preference optimization framework that enforces worst-case alignment objectives via selective geometry control over alignment-critical parameter subspace. By avoiding uniform geometry constraints, ShaPO mitigates the over-regularization that can harm robustness under distribution shift. We instantiate ShaPO at two levels: token-level ShaPO stabilizes likelihood-based surrogate optimization, while reward-level ShaPO enforces reward-consistent optimization under noisy supervision. Across diverse safety benchmarks and noisy preference settings, ShaPO consistently improves safety robustness over popular preference optimization methods. Moreover, ShaPO composes cleanly with data-robust objectives, yielding additional gains and empirically supporting the proposed optimization-geometry perspective."}

However, it remains unclear whether these simulations reproduce the personality-behavior patterns observed in humans. Human personality, for instance, shapes how individuals navigate social interactions, including strategic choices and behaviors in emotionally charged interactions. This raises the question: Can LLMs, when prompted with personality traits, reproduce personality-driven differences in human conflict behavior? To explore this, we introduce an evaluation framework that enables direct comparison of human-human and LLM-LLM behaviors in dispute resolution dialogues with respect to Big Five Inventory (BFI) personality traits. This framework provides a set of interpretable metrics related to strategic behavior and conflict outcomes. We additionally contribute a novel dataset creation methodology for LLM dispute resolution dialogues with matched scenarios and personality traits with respect to human conversations. Finally, we demonstrate the use of our evaluation framework with three contemporary closed-source LLMs and show significant divergences in how personality manifests in conflict across different LLMs compared to human data, challenging the assumption that personality-prompted agents can serve as reliable behavioral proxies in socially impactful applications.

Specifically, the proposed method consists of two phases: i) In the first phase for pretraining, the policy is created in a behavior cloning (BC) manner, through leveraging the learning data from our AR-based remote human-robot interaction system; ii) In the second phase, a contrastive learning empowered reinforcement learning (RL) method is developed to obtain more efficient and robust policy than the BC, and thus a projection head is designed to accelerate the learning progress. An event-driven augmented reward is adopted for enhancing the safety. To validate the proposed method, both the physics simulations via PyBullet and real-world experiments are carried out. The results demonstrate that compared to the classic proximal policy optimization and soft actor-critic policies, our method not only significantly speeds up the inference, but also achieves much better performance in terms of the success rate for fulfilling the manipulation tasks.

We further document industrial-scale bot farming (four accounts producing 32% of all comments with 12-second coordination gaps) and rapid decay of human influence through reply chains (half-life: 0.65 conversation depths).

Neither humans nor single-agent LLMs can fully contend with this torrent of information, with the latter often prone to hallucinations. To address this bottleneck, we introduce a multi-agent framework guided by large-scale knowledge graphs to find sustainable substitutes for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)-chemicals currently under intense regulatory scrutiny. Agents in the framework specialize in problem decomposition, evidence retrieval, design parameter extraction, and graph traversal, uncovering latent connections across distinct knowledge pockets to support hypothesis generation. Ablation studies show that the full multi-agent pipeline outperforms single-shot prompting, underscoring the value of distributed specialization and relational reasoning. We demonstrate that by tailoring graph traversal strategies, the system alternates between exploitative searches focusing on domain-critical outcomes and exploratory searches surfacing emergent cross-connections. Illustrated through the exemplar of biomedical tubing, the framework generates sustainable PFAS-free alternatives that balance tribological performance, thermal stability, chemical resistance, and biocompatibility.

This paper presents AGENTWM, the first watermarking framework designed specifically for agentic models. AGENTWM exploits the semantic equivalence of action sequences, injecting watermarks by subtly biasing the distribution of functionally identical tool execution paths. This mechanism allows AGENTWM to embed verifiable signals directly into the visible action trajectory while remaining indistinguishable to users. We develop an automated pipeline to generate robust watermark schemes and a rigorous statistical hypothesis testing procedure for verification. Extensive evaluations across three complex domains demonstrate that AGENTWM achieves high detection accuracy with negligible impact on agent performance. Our results confirm that AGENTWM effectively protects agentic IP against adaptive adversaries, who cannot remove the watermarks without severely degrading the stolen model's utility."}

Illusory Completion in Search Agents", "comment": null, "summary": "Recent search agents leverage multi-turn reasoning and search tools to achieve strong performance on multi-hop and long-horizon benchmarks. Yet it remains unclear whether they reliably reason across all requirements by tracking, verifying, and maintaining multiple conditions in these questions. We study this capability under multi-constraint problems, where valid answers must satisfy several constraints simultaneously. We find that illusory completion frequently occurs, wherein agents believe tasks are complete despite unresolved or violated constraints, leading to underverified answers. To diagnose this behavior, we introduce the Epistemic Ledger, an evaluation framework that tracks evidential support and agents' beliefs for each constraint throughout multi-turn reasoning. Our analysis reveals four recurring failure patterns: bare assertions, overlooked refutations, stagnation, and premature exit. Motivated by these findings, we examine whether explicit constraint-state tracking during execution mitigates these failures via LiveLedger, an inference-time tracker. This simple intervention consistently improves performance, substantially reducing underverified answers (by up to 26.5%) and improving overall accuracy (by up to 11.6%) on multi-constraint problems."}

In Time Series Classification (TSC), ensembles have proven highly effective whether based on neural networks (NNs) or traditional methods like HIVE-COTE. However most existing NN-based ensemble methods for TSC train multiple models with identical architectures and configurations. These ensembles aggregate predictions without explicitly promoting diversity which often leads to redundant feature representations and limits the benefits of ensembling. In this work, we introduce a diversity-driven ensemble learning framework that explicitly encourages feature diversity among neural network ensemble members. Our approach employs a decorrelated learning strategy using a feature orthogonality loss applied directly to the learned feature representations. This ensures that each model in the ensemble captures complementary rather than redundant information. We evaluate our framework on 128 datasets from the UCR archive and show that it achieves SOTA performance with fewer models. This makes our method both efficient and scalable compared to conventional NN-based ensemble approaches."}

These devices, typically relying on TinyML models, collaboratively train global models by sharing gradients with a central server while preserving data privacy. However, as data heterogeneity and task complexity increase, TinyML models often become insufficient to capture intricate patterns, especially under extreme non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) conditions. Moreover, ensuring robustness against malicious clients and poisoned updates remains a major challenge. Accordingly, this paper introduces RIFLE - a Robust, distillation-based Federated Learning framework that replaces gradient sharing with logit-based knowledge transfer. By leveraging a knowledge distillation aggregation scheme, RIFLE enables the training of deep models such as VGG-19 and Resnet18 within constrained IoT systems. Furthermore, a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based validation mechanism quantifies the reliability of client updates without exposing raw data, achieving high trust and privacy preservation simultaneously. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100) under heterogeneous non-IID conditions demonstrate that RIFLE reduces false-positive detections by up to 87.5%, enhances poisoning attack mitigation by 62.5%, and achieves up to 28.3% higher accuracy compared to conventional federated learning baselines within only 10 rounds. Notably, RIFLE reduces VGG19 training time from over 600 days to just 1.39 hours on typical IoT devices (0.3 GFLOPS), making deep learning practical in resource-constrained networks."}

Current personalized multimodal models are predominantly static-concepts are fixed at initialization and cannot evolve during interactions. We propose M2A, an agentic dual-layer hybrid memory system that maintains personalized multimodal information through online updates. The system employs two collaborative agents: ChatAgent manages user interactions and autonomously decides when to query or update memory, while MemoryManager breaks down memory requests from ChatAgent into detailed operations on the dual-layer memory bank, which couples a RawMessageStore (immutable conversation log) with a SemanticMemoryStore (high-level observations), providing memories at different granularities. In addition, we develop a reusable data synthesis pipeline that injects concept-grounded sessions from Yo'LLaVA and MC-LLaVA into LoCoMo long conversations while preserving temporal coherence. Experiments show that M2A significantly outperforms baselines, demonstrating that transforming personalization from one-shot configuration to a co-evolving memory mechanism provides a viable path for high-quality individualized responses in long-term multimodal interactions.

Existing mitigation strategies often face critical limitations: they either yield insufficient outlier suppression or incur significant deployment inefficiencies, such as inference latency, heavy preprocessing, or reliance on complex operator fusion. To resolve these limitations, we leverage a key insight: over-parameterized LLMs often converge to Flat Minima, implying a vast equivalent solution space where weights can be adjusted without compromising accuracy. Building on this, we propose Astro, an Activation-guided Structured Regularization framework designed to suppress the negative effects of outliers in a hardware-friendly and efficient manner. Leveraging the activation-guided regularization objective, Astro actively reconstructs intrinsically robust weights, aggressively suppressing weight outliers corresponding to high-magnitude activations without sacrificing model accuracy. Crucially, Astro introduces zero inference latency and is orthogonal to mainstream quantization methods like GPTQ. Extensive experiments show that Astro achieves highly competitive performance; notably, on LLaMA-2-7B, it achieves better performance than complex learning-based rotation methods with almost 1/3 of the quantization time."}

We reframe alignment evaluation as a problem of information flow under partial observability. Within this framework, we show that divergence between evaluation-time and deployment-time behavior is bounded by the mutual information between internal representations and the regime variable. Motivated by this result, we study regime-blind mechanisms: training-time interventions that reduce the extractability of regime information at decision-relevant internal representations via adversarial invariance. We evaluate this approach on a base, open-weight language model across two fully characterized failure modes -scientific sycophancy and temporal sleeper agents. Regime-blind training suppresses regime-conditioned behavior in both evaluated cases without measurable loss of task utility, but with qualitatively different dynamics: sycophancy exhibits a sharp representational and behavioral transition at low intervention strength, whereas sleeper-agent behavior requires substantially stronger pressure and does not exhibit a clean collapse of regime decodability. These results demonstrate that representational invariance is a meaningful but fundamentally limited control lever, whose effectiveness depends on how regime information is embedded in the policy. We argue that behavioral evaluation should be complemented with white-box diagnostics of regime awareness and information flow."}

Unlike prior approaches that ignore future interventions or directly use large language models (LLMs) for numerical forecasting, EventCast leverages LLMs solely for event-driven reasoning. Unstructured business data, which covers campaigns, holiday schedules, and seller incentives, from existing operational databases, is processed by an LLM that converts it into interpretable textual summaries leveraging world knowledge for cultural nuances and novel event combinations. These summaries are fused with historical demand features within a dual-tower architecture, enabling accurate, explainable, and scalable forecasts. Deployed on real-world e-commerce scenarios spanning 4 countries of 160 regions over 10 months, EventCast achieves up to 86.9% and 97.7% improvement on MAE and MSE compared to the variant without event knowledge, and reduces MAE by up to 57.0% and MSE by 83.3% versus the best industrial baseline during event-driven periods.

However, the full scalability and theoretical basis of these approaches remains unclear. To address this, we study the infinite width and depth limits of PCNs. For linear residual networks, we show that the set of width- and depth-stable feature-learning parameterisations for PC is exactly the same as for BP. Moreover, under any of these parameterisations, the PC energy with equilibrated activities converges to the BP loss in a regime where the model width is much larger than the depth, resulting in PC computing the same gradients as BP. Experiments show that these results hold in practice for deep nonlinear networks, as long as an activity equilibrium seem to be reached. Overall, this work unifies various previous theoretical and empirical results and has potentially important implications for the scaling of PCNs."}

We challenge this assumption by introducing implicit memory-the ability of a model to carry state across otherwise independent interactions by encoding information in its own outputs and later recovering it when those outputs are reintroduced as input. This mechanism does not require any explicit memory module, yet it creates a persistent information channel across inference requests. As a concrete demonstration, we introduce a new class of temporal backdoors, which we call time bombs. Unlike conventional backdoors that activate on a single trigger input, time bombs activate only after a sequence of interactions satisfies hidden conditions accumulated via implicit memory. We show that such behavior can be induced today through straightforward prompting or fine-tuning. Beyond this case study, we analyze broader implications of implicit memory, including covert inter-agent communication, benchmark contamination, targeted manipulation, and training-data poisoning.

To address this bottleneck, we propose Geo-coder -- the first inverse programming framework for geometric images based on a multi-agent system. Our method innovatively decouples the process into geometric modeling via pixel-wise anchoring and metric-driven code evolution: Stage 1 leverages the complementary advantages of visual operators and large models to achieve precise capture of pixel coordinates and visual attributes; Stage 2 introduces a synthesis-rendering-validation closed loop, where bidirectional visual feedback drives the self-correction of code. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Geo-coder achieves a substantial lead in both geometric reconstruction accuracy and visual consistency. Notably, by effectively preserving the core geometric semantics, the images reconstructed with our method exhibit equivalent performance to the original ones in multimodal reasoning tasks, which fully validates the robustness of the framework. Finally, to further reduce research costs, we have open-sourced the Geo-coder dataset constructed on the GeoCode framework, which contains more than 1,500 samples. On this basis, we have also open-sourced the GeocodeLM model, laying a solid data and model foundation for subsequent research in this field."}

In this work, we propose dense feature learning, a representation centric framework that explicitly shapes the linear structure of medical embeddings. Our approach operates directly on embedding matrices, encouraging spectral balance, subspace consistency, and feature orthogonality through objectives defined entirely in terms of linear algebraic properties. Without relying on labels or generative reconstruction, dense feature learning produces representations with higher effective rank, improved conditioning, and greater stability across time. Empirical evaluations across longitudinal EHR data, clinical text, and multimodal patient representations demonstrate consistent improvements in downstream linear performance, robustness, and subspace alignment compared to supervised and self supervised baselines. These results suggest that learning to span clinical variation may be as important as learning to predict clinical outcomes, and position representation geometry as a first class objective in medical AI."}

Our approach employs a Meta Agent that searches over memory designs expressed as executable code in an open-ended manner, theoretically allowing the discovery of arbitrary memory designs, including database schemas as well as their retrieval and update mechanisms. Extensive experiments across four sequential decision-making domains demonstrate that the learned memory designs enable more effective and efficient learning from experience than state-of-the-art human-crafted memory designs on all benchmarks.

By allowing agents to iteratively explore and refine within the environment, the framework facilitates evolution from parameter-sharing homogeneous multi-role training to heterogeneous multi-agent training, breaking through single-agent capability limits. We also introduce an efficient inference strategy MARTI-MARS2-T+ to fully exploit the scaling potential of multi-agent collaboration at test time.

However, leveraging LLM reasoning for time series remains in its infancy, hindered by the absence of carefully curated time series CoT data for training, limited data efficiency caused by underexplored data scheduling, and the lack of RL algorithms tailored for exploiting such time series CoT data.

We further devise Configuration-Aware Two-stage Training (CAT), combining rejection sampling fine-tuning with trajectory-level reinforcement learning to internalize this meta-capability. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that ToolSelf rivals specialized workflows while generalizing to novel tasks, achieving a 24.1% average performance gain and illuminating a path toward truly self-adaptive agents."}

Motivated by classical mechanics, we introduce Kinetic Path Energy (KPE), an action-like, per-sample diagnostic that measures the accumulated kinetic effort along an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) trajectory. Empirically, KPE exhibits two robust correspondences: (i) higher KPE predicts stronger semantic fidelity; (ii) high-KPE trajectories terminate on low-density manifold frontiers. We further provide theoretical guarantees linking trajectory energy to data density. Paradoxically, this correlation is non-monotonic. At sufficiently high energy, generation can degenerate into memorization. Leveraging the closed-form of empirical flow matching, we show that extreme energies drive trajectories toward near-copies of training examples.

Consequently, this multi-task scenario requires addressing critical questions: which tasks are similar, and how and why do they exhibit similarity? In this work, we propose a multi-task similarity measure based on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques, specifically Accumulated Local Effects (ALE) curves.\n  ALE curves are compared using the Fréchet distance, weighted by the data distribution, and the resulting similarity measure incorporates the importance of each feature. The measure is applicable in both single-task learning scenarios, where each task is trained separately, and multi-task learning scenarios, where all tasks are learned simultaneously. The measure is model-agnostic, allowing the use of different machine learning models across tasks. A scaling factor is introduced to account for differences in predictive performance across tasks, and several recommendations are provided for applying the measure in complex scenarios.\n  We validate this measure using four datasets, one synthetic dataset and three real-world datasets. The real-world datasets include a well-known Parkinson's dataset and a bike-sharing usage dataset -- both structured in tabular format -- as well as the CelebA dataset, which is used to evaluate the application of concept bottleneck encoders in a multitask learning setting. The results demonstrate that the measure aligns with intuitive expectations of task similarity across both tabular and non-tabular data, making it a valuable tool for exploring relationships between tasks and supporting informed decision-making."}

Specifically, we propose MedCoG, a Medical Meta-Cognition Agent with Knowledge Graph, where the meta-cognitive assessments of task complexity, familiarity, and knowledge density dynamically regulate utilization of procedural, episodic, and factual knowledge. The LLM-centric on-demand reasoning aims to mitigate scaling laws by (1) reducing costs via avoiding indiscriminate scaling, (2) improving accuracy via filtering out distractive knowledge. To validate this, we empirically characterize the scaling curve and introduce inference density to quantify inference efficiency, defined as the ratio of theoretically effective cost to actual cost. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of MedCoG on five hard sets of medical benchmarks, yielding 5.5x inference density. Furthermore, the Oracle study highlights the significant potential of meta-cognitive regulation."}

This ability, collectively known as general continual learning (GCL), encapsulates practical challenges such as online datastreams and blurry task boundaries. Although leveraging pretrained models (PTMs) has greatly advanced conventional continual learning (CL), these methods remain limited in reconciling the diverse and temporally mixed information along a single pass, resulting in sub-optimal GCL performance. Inspired by meta-plasticity and reconstructive memory in neuroscience, we introduce here an innovative approach named Meta Post-Refinement (MePo) for PTMs-based GCL. This approach constructs pseudo task sequences from pretraining data and develops a bi-level meta-learning paradigm to refine the pretrained backbone, which serves as a prolonged pretraining phase but greatly facilitates rapid adaptation of representation learning to downstream GCL tasks. MePo further initializes a meta covariance matrix as the reference geometry of pretrained representation space, enabling GCL to exploit second-order statistics for robust output alignment. MePo serves as a plug-in strategy that achieves significant performance gains across a variety of GCL benchmarks and pretrained checkpoints in a rehearsal-free manner (e.g., 15.10\\%, 13.36\\%, and 12.56\\% on CIFAR-100, ImageNet-R, and CUB-200 under Sup-21/1K).

To solve this problem, we introduce Implicit Strategic Optimization (ISO), a prediction-aware framework in which each agent forecasts the current strategic context and uses it to update its policy online. ISO combines a Strategic Reward Model (SRM) that estimates the long-run strategic value of actions with iso-grpo, a context-conditioned optimistic learning rule. We prove sublinear contextual regret and equilibrium convergence guarantees whose dominant terms scale with the number of context mispredictions; when prediction errors are bounded, our bounds recover the static-game rates obtained when strategic externalities are known. Experiments in 6-player No-Limit Texas Hold'em and competitive Pokemon show consistent improvements in long-term return over strong LLM and RL baselines, and graceful degradation under controlled prediction noise."}

We present V-ABFT, a variance-based adaptive threshold algorithm that achieves tighter error bounds by directly modeling the verification difference. By leveraging statistical variance estimation, V-ABFT reduces the threshold-to-actual-error ratio to approximately $7$--$20\\times$ for FP32/FP64 and $48$--$158\\times$ for BF16, representing a \\textbf{6--48$\\times$ improvement} over A-ABFT while maintaining zero false positive rate across BF16, FP16, FP32, and FP64 precisions.

In realistic scenarios, however, LLMs often need to act as agents that explore environments, follow instructions and plans, extract useful information, and predict correct actions under a dynamically growing context. To assess language agents in such settings, we introduce LOCA-bench (a benchmark for LOng-Context Agents). Given a task prompt, LOCA-bench leverages automated and scalable control of environment states to regulate the agent's context length. This design enables LOCA-bench to extend the context length potentially to infinity in a controlled way while keeping the underlying task semantics fixed. LOCA-bench evaluates language agents as a combination of models and scaffolds, including various context management strategies.

We propose mmSIVAE, a multimodal soft-introspective variational autoencoder combined with Mixture-of-Product-of-Experts (MOPOE) aggregation to improve reference fidelity and multimodal integration. We compute deviation scores in latent space and feature space as distances from the learned healthy distributions, and map statistically significant latent deviations to regional abnormalities for interpretability. On ADNI MRI regional volumes and amyloid PET SUVR, mmSIVAE improves reconstruction on held-out controls and produces more discriminative deviation scores for outlier detection than VAE baselines, with higher likelihood ratios and clearer separation between control and AD-spectrum cohorts.

Across multiple domains, EXPERIGEN consistently discovers 2-4x more statistically significant hypotheses that are 7-17 percent more predictive than prior approaches, and naturally extends to complex data regimes including multimodal and relational datasets. Beyond statistical performance, hypotheses must be novel, empirically grounded, and actionable to drive real scientific progress. To evaluate these qualities, we conduct an expert review of machine-generated hypotheses, collecting feedback from senior faculty.

RAPS is grounded in the Distributed Publish-Subscribe Protocol, allowing LLM agents to exchange messages based on their declared intents rather than predefined topologies. Beyond this substrate, RAPS further incorporates two coherent overlays: (i) Reactive Subscription, enabling agents to dynamically refine their intents; and (ii) Bayesian Reputation, empowering each agent with a local watchdog to detect and isolate malicious peers.

To assess the clinical utility of SAG, we conduct extensive evaluations using diverse clinical metrics spanning effectiveness, reliability, and deployment cost. Our results show that SAG achieves superior performance compared to a single giant model, both with and without additional optimization or retrieval-augmented generation.

Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), in particular, offers a promising avenue by decomposing complex tasks into specialized subtasks learned by distinct interacting agents, potentially enhancing the ability and efficiency of LLM systems. However, theoretical insights regarding when and why MARL outperforms Single-Agent RL (SARL) remain limited, creating uncertainty in selecting the appropriate RL framework. In this paper, we address this critical gap by rigorously analyzing the comparative sample efficiency of MARL and SARL within the context of LLM. Leveraging the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) framework, we formally define SARL and MARL setups for LLMs, derive explicit sample complexity bounds, and systematically characterize how task decomposition and alignment influence learning efficiency. Our results demonstrate that MARL improves sample complexity when tasks naturally decompose into independent subtasks, whereas dependent subtasks diminish MARL's comparative advantage. Additionally, we introduce and analyze the concept of task alignment, quantifying the trade-offs when enforcing independent task decomposition despite potential misalignments. These theoretical insights clarify empirical inconsistencies and provide practical criteria for deploying MARL strategies effectively in complex LLM scenarios."}

Unlike standard robust methods that rely on statistical consensus (trusting the majority), ESA utilizes sparse safety axioms to judge the source of the feedback rather than the signal itself. We prove that this \"judging the judges\" mechanism guarantees convergence to the true objective, even when a majority of evaluators are biased. Empirically, we show that while traditional consensus methods fail under majority collusion, our approach successfully recovers the optimal policy."}

However, they do not work well for deep chains. The root cause of this limitation stems from the Semantic Entanglement problem in these extended workflows. In standard textual backpropagation, feedback signals mix local critiques with upstream contexts, leading to Attribution Ambiguity. To address this challenge, we propose TextResNet, a framework that reformulates the optimization process to achieve precise signal routing via four key innovations. Firstly, in the forward pass, it enforces Additive Semantic Deltas to preserve an Identity Highway for gradient flow. Secondly, in the backward pass, it introduces Semantic Gradient Decomposition via a Semantic Projector to disentangle feedback into causally independent subspaces. Thirdly, it implements Causal Routing, which routes projected signals to their specific components. Finally, it performs Density-Aware Optimization Scheduling to leverage the disentangled signals to dynamically allocate resources to key system bottlenecks. Our results show that TextResNet not only achieves superior performance compared to TextGrad, but also exhibits remarkable stability for agentic tasks in compound AI systems where baselines collapse.

Stage 1 performs interpretable per-agent failure detection via Taylor-remainder analysis of policy-gradient costs, declaring an initial Patient-0 candidate at the first threshold crossing. Stage 2 provides validation through geometric analysis of critic derivatives-first-order sensitivity and directional second-order curvature aggregated over causal windows to construct interpretable contagion graphs. This approach explains \"downstream-first\" detection anomalies by revealing pathways that amplify upstream deviations. Evaluated across 500 episodes in Simple Spread (3 and 5 agents) and 100 episodes in StarCraft II using MADDPG and HATRPO, our method achieves 88.2-99.4% Patient-0 detection accuracy while providing interpretable geometric evidence for detection decisions.

This framework advances upon prior methods, such as BSAFE, by primarily leveraging a Reinforcement Learning (RL) stage where models learn to dynamically correct their own generation errors. Through RL with critic feedback on the model's live outputs, LLMs are trained to identify and recover from their actual, emergent safety violations by emitting an efficient \"backtrack by x tokens\" signal, then continuing generation autoregressively. This RL process is crucial for instilling resilience against sophisticated adversarial strategies, including middle filling, Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) attacks, and decoding parameter manipulations. To further support the acquisition of this backtracking capability, we also propose an enhanced Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) data generation strategy (BSAFE+). This method improves upon previous data creation techniques by injecting violations into coherent, originally safe text, providing more effective initial training for the backtracking mechanism. Comprehensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that RLBF significantly reduces attack success rates across diverse benchmarks and model scales, achieving superior safety outcomes while critically preserving foundational model utility."}

Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) targets these mechanisms but faces scalability challenges. Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) offers potential for delivering personalized DBT coaching at scale, yet rapid development has outpaced safety infrastructure. Methods: We developed Glow, a GenAI-powered DBT skills coach delivering chain and solution analysis for individuals at risk for HIV and substance use. In partnership with a Los Angeles community health organization, we conducted usability testing with clinical staff (n=6) and individuals with lived experience (n=28). Using the Helpful, Honest, and Harmless (HHH) framework, we employed user-driven adversarial testing wherein participants identified target behaviors and generated contextually realistic risk probes. We evaluated safety performance across 37 risk probe interactions. Results: Glow appropriately handled 73% of risk probes, but performance varied by agent. The solution analysis agent demonstrated 90% appropriate handling versus 44% for the chain analysis agent. Safety failures clustered around encouraging substance use and normalizing harmful behaviors. The chain analysis agent fell into an \"empathy trap,\" providing validation that reinforced maladaptive beliefs. Additionally, 27 instances of DBT skill misinformation were identified. Conclusions: This study provides the first systematic safety evaluation of GenAI-delivered DBT coaching for HIV and substance use risk reduction.

The HHH framework and user-driven adversarial testing offer replicable methods for evaluating GenAI mental health interventions."}

These devices, typically relying on TinyML models, collaboratively train global models by sharing gradients with a central server while preserving data privacy. However, as data heterogeneity and task complexity increase, TinyML models often become insufficient to capture intricate patterns, especially under extreme non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) conditions. Moreover, ensuring robustness against malicious clients and poisoned updates remains a major challenge. Accordingly, this paper introduces RIFLE - a Robust, distillation-based Federated Learning framework that replaces gradient sharing with logit-based knowledge transfer. By leveraging a knowledge distillation aggregation scheme, RIFLE enables the training of deep models such as VGG-19 and Resnet18 within constrained IoT systems. Furthermore, a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based validation mechanism quantifies the reliability of client updates without exposing raw data, achieving high trust and privacy preservation simultaneously. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100) under heterogeneous non-IID conditions demonstrate that RIFLE reduces false-positive detections by up to 87.5%, enhances poisoning attack mitigation by 62.5%, and achieves up to 28.3% higher accuracy compared to conventional federated learning baselines within only 10 rounds. Notably, RIFLE reduces VGG19 training time from over 600 days to just 1.39 hours on typical IoT devices (0.3 GFLOPS), making deep learning practical in resource-constrained networks."}

We challenge this assumption by introducing implicit memory-the ability of a model to carry state across otherwise independent interactions by encoding information in its own outputs and later recovering it when those outputs are reintroduced as input. This mechanism does not require any explicit memory module, yet it creates a persistent information channel across inference requests. As a concrete demonstration, we introduce a new class of temporal backdoors, which we call time bombs. Unlike conventional backdoors that activate on a single trigger input, time bombs activate only after a sequence of interactions satisfies hidden conditions accumulated via implicit memory. We show that such behavior can be induced today through straightforward prompting or fine-tuning. Beyond this case study, we analyze broader implications of implicit memory, including covert inter-agent communication, benchmark contamination, targeted manipulation, and training-data poisoning.

Our empirical analysis reveals an alarming inconsistency in existing evaluations: the standard deviation across ten repeated runs of a single model on HumanEval (1.67) actually exceeds the performance gap among the top-10 models on the official leaderboard (0.91), rendering current rankings statistically precarious. To mitigate these instabilities, we propose a decentralized evaluation framework that enables hardware and parameter diversity through large-scale benchmarking across heterogeneous compute nodes. By leveraging the blockchain-based protocol, the framework incentivizes global contributors to act as independent validators, using a robust reward system to ensure evaluation integrity and discourage dishonest participation. This collective verification transforms evaluation from a \"centralized black box\" into a \"decentralized endorsement\" where multi-party consensus and diverse inference environments yield a more stable, representative metric. Experimental results demonstrate that the decentralized evaluation framework reduces the standard deviation across ten runs on the same model to 0.28. This significant improvement over conventional frameworks ensures higher statistical confidence in model rankings. We have completely implemented this platform and will soon release it to the community."}

Model merging offers a compelling alternative by directly integrating the weights of multiple source models without requiring additional data or extensive training. However, conventional model merging techniques, such as parameter averaging, often suffer from the unintended combination of non-generalizable features, especially when source models exhibit significant weight disparities. Comparatively, model ensembling generally provides more stable and superior performance that aggregates multiple models by averaging outputs. However, it incurs higher inference costs and increased storage requirements. While previous studies experimentally showed the similarities between model merging and ensembling, theoretical evidence and evaluation metrics remain lacking. To address this gap, we introduce Merging-ensembling loss (M-Loss), a novel evaluation metric that quantifies the compatibility of merging source models using very limited unlabeled data. By measuring the discrepancy between parameter averaging and model ensembling at layer and node levels, M-Loss facilitates more effective merging strategies. Specifically, M-Loss serves both as a quantitative criterion of the theoretical feasibility of model merging, and a guide for parameter significance in model pruning. Our theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations demonstrate that incorporating M-Loss into the merging process significantly improves the alignment between merged models and model ensembling, providing a scalable and efficient framework for accurate model consolidation."}

In order to overcome these shortcomings, we put forth a unified in-processing convex optimization framework, termed FairRARI, for tackling different group-fairness criteria in a ``plug and play'' fashion. Leveraging a variational formulation of PR, the framework computes fair PR vectors by solving a strongly convex optimization problem with fairness constraints, thereby ensuring that a target fairness level is achieved. We further introduce three different fairness criteria which can be efficiently tackled using FairRARI to compute fair PR vectors with the same asymptotic time-complexity as the original PR algorithm.

Our results show that providing Predefined Category Subsets achieves 97.2% of the personalization performance (evaluated via an LLM-as-a-Judge framework across three criteria) obtained when sharing Detailed Browsing History.

In the first stage, we introduce a synthesis-then-hybrid strategy, which involves a synthesis operation to generate pure synthetic data, followed by a hybrid operation that fuses the synthetic data with the original data. In the second stage, we present a kernel ridge regression (KRR)-based synthesis strategy, where a KRR model is first trained on the original data and then used to generate synthetic outputs based on the synthetic inputs produced in the first stage.

To address these limitations, we introduce the Shapley-based Hierarchical Attribution for Reinforcement Policy (SHARP), a novel framework for optimizing multi-agent reinforcement learning via precise credit attribution. SHARP effectively stabilizes training by normalizing agent-specific advantages across trajectory groups, primarily through a decomposed reward mechanism comprising a global broadcast-accuracy reward, a Shapley-based marginal-credit reward for each agent, and a tool-process reward to improve execution efficiency.

To explain these differences, we fit a mechanistic model that captures systematic deviations from optimal behavior via four interpretable latent variables: memory, strategy, choice bias, and occlusion awareness. This model places humans and models in a shared low-dimensional cognitive space, reproduces behavioral signatures across agents, and shows how chain-of-thought shifts language models toward human-like regimes of evidence accumulation and belief-to-choice mapping, tightening alignment in inference while leaving a persistent gap in information acquisition."}

In this work, we take a first step toward unifying heterogeneous memory paradigms within a single memory system. We propose MemAdapter, a memory retrieval framework that enables fast alignment across agent memory paradigms. MemAdapter adopts a two-stage training strategy: (1) training a generative subgraph retriever from the unified memory space, and (2) adapting the retriever to unseen memory paradigms by training a lightweight alignment module through contrastive learning. This design improves the flexibility for memory retrieval and substantially reduces alignment cost across paradigms. Comprehensive experiments on three public evaluation benchmarks demonstrate that the generative subgraph retriever consistently outperforms five strong agent memory systems across three memory paradigms and agent model scales. Notably, MemAdapter completes cross-paradigm alignment within 13 minutes on a single GPU, achieving superior performance over original memory retrievers with less than 5% of training compute. Furthermore, MemAdapter enables effective zero-shot fusion across memory paradigms, highlighting its potential as a plug-and-play solution for agent memory systems."}

Based on this finding, we propose Dr. MAS, a simple and stable RL training recipe for multi-agent LLM systems. Dr. MAS uses an agent-wise remedy: normalizing advantages per agent using each agent's own reward statistics, which calibrates gradient scales and dramatically stabilizes training, both theoretically and empirically. Beyond the algorithm, Dr. MAS provides an end-to-end RL training framework for multi-agent LLM systems, supporting scalable orchestration, flexible per-agent LLM serving and optimization configs, and shared resource scheduling of LLM actor backends.

Current approaches often rely on unreliable LLMs for safety checks or simply reject unsafe plans without offering repairs. We introduce the Verifiable Iterative Refinement Framework (VIRF), a neuro-symbolic architecture that shifts the paradigm from passive safety gatekeeping to active collaboration. Our core contribution is a tutor-apprentice dialogue where a deterministic Logic Tutor, grounded in a formal safety ontology, provides causal and pedagogical feedback to an LLM planner. This enables intelligent plan repairs rather than mere avoidance. We also introduce a scalable knowledge acquisition pipeline that synthesizes safety knowledge bases from real-world documents, correcting blind spots in existing benchmarks. In challenging home safety tasks, VIRF achieves a perfect 0 percent Hazardous Action Rate (HAR) and a 77.3 percent Goal-Condition Rate (GCR), which is the highest among all baselines. It is highly efficient, requiring only 1.1 correction iterations on average. VIRF demonstrates a principled pathway toward building fundamentally trustworthy and verifiably safe embodied agents."}

We propose a framework for evaluating goal-directedness that integrates behavioural evaluation with interpretability-based analyses of models' internal representations. As a case study, we examine an LLM agent navigating a 2D grid world toward a goal state. Behaviourally, we evaluate the agent against an optimal policy across varying grid sizes, obstacle densities, and goal structures, finding that performance scales with task difficulty while remaining robust to difficulty-preserving transformations and complex goal structures. We then use probing methods to decode the agent's internal representations of the environment state and its multi-step action plans. We find that the LLM agent non-linearly encodes a coarse spatial map of the environment, preserving approximate task-relevant cues about its position and the goal location; that its actions are broadly consistent with these internal representations; and that reasoning reorganises them, shifting from broader environment structural cues toward information supporting immediate action selection. Our findings support the view that introspective examination is required beyond behavioural evaluations to characterise how agents represent and pursue their objectives."}

This difficulty partly arises from the natural rarity of certain classes (or hierarchical nodes) and the hierarchical constraint that ensures child nodes are almost always less frequent than their parents. To address this, we propose a weighted loss objective for neural networks that combines node-wise imbalance weighting with focal weighting components, the latter leveraging modern quantification of ensemble uncertainties. By emphasizing rare nodes rather than rare observations (data points), and focusing on uncertain nodes for each model output distribution during training, we observe improvements in recall by up to a factor of five on benchmark datasets, along with statistically significant gains in $F_{1}$ score. We also show our approach aids convolutional networks on challenging tasks, as in situations with suboptimal encoders or limited data."}

We demonstrate that these systems are highly vulnerable to imitation attacks, where adversaries steal proprietary capabilities by training imitation models on victim outputs. Crucially, existing LLM watermarking techniques fail in this domain because real-world agentic systems often operate as grey boxes, concealing the internal reasoning traces required for verification. This paper presents AGENTWM, the first watermarking framework designed specifically for agentic models. AGENTWM exploits the semantic equivalence of action sequences, injecting watermarks by subtly biasing the distribution of functionally identical tool execution paths. This mechanism allows AGENTWM to embed verifiable signals directly into the visible action trajectory while remaining indistinguishable to users. We develop an automated pipeline to generate robust watermark schemes and a rigorous statistical hypothesis testing procedure for verification. Extensive evaluations across three complex domains demonstrate that AGENTWM achieves high detection accuracy with negligible impact on agent performance. Our results confirm that AGENTWM effectively protects agentic IP against adaptive adversaries, who cannot remove the watermarks without severely degrading the stolen model's utility."}

This assumption becomes fragile for agents with situational awareness, which may exploitregime leakage-informational cues distinguishing evaluation from deployment-to implement conditional policies such as sycophancy and sleeper agents, which preserve compliance under oversight while defecting in deployment-like regimes. We reframe alignment evaluation as a problem of information flow under partial observability. Within this framework, we show that divergence between evaluation-time and deployment-time behavior is bounded by the mutual information between internal representations and the regime variable. Motivated by this result, we study regime-blind mechanisms: training-time interventions that reduce the extractability of regime information at decision-relevant internal representations via adversarial invariance. We evaluate this approach on a base, open-weight language model across two fully characterized failure modes -scientific sycophancy and temporal sleeper agents. Regime-blind training suppresses regime-conditioned behavior in both evaluated cases without measurable loss of task utility, but with qualitatively different dynamics: sycophancy exhibits a sharp representational and behavioral transition at low intervention strength, whereas sleeper-agent behavior requires substantially stronger pressure and does not exhibit a clean collapse of regime decodability. These results demonstrate that representational invariance is a meaningful but fundamentally limited control lever, whose effectiveness depends on how regime information is embedded in the policy. We argue that behavioral evaluation should be complemented with white-box diagnostics of regime awareness and information flow."}

Meanwhile, despite the rapid advancement of Search Agents, their practical deployment is constrained by a fundamental limitation, termed as 1) Latency Challenge: the serial execution of multi-round reasoning, tool calling, and tool response waiting under the ReAct agent paradigm induces severe end-to-end latency. Intuitively, dLLMs can leverage their distinctive strengths to optimize the operational efficiency of agents under the ReAct agent paradigm. Practically, existing dLLM backbones face the 2) Agent Ability Challenge. That is, existing dLLMs exhibit remarkably weak reasoning and tool-calling capabilities, preventing these advantages from being effectively realized in practice. In this paper, we propose DLLM-Searcher, an optimization framework for dLLM-based Search Agents. To solve the Agent Ability Challenge, we design a two-stage post-training pipeline encompassing Agentic Supervised Fine-Tuning (Agentic SFT) and Agentic Variance-Reduced Preference Optimization Agentic VRPO, which enhances the backbone dLLM's information seeking and reasoning capabilities. To mitigate the Latency Challenge, we leverage the flexible generation mechanism of dLLMs and propose a novel agent paradigm termed Parallel-Reasoning and Acting P-ReAct. P-ReAct guides the model to prioritize decoding tool_call instructions, thereby allowing the model to keep thinking while waiting for the tool's return. Experimental results demonstrate that DLLM-Searcher achieves performance comparable to mainstream LLM-based search agents and P-ReAct delivers approximately 15% inference acceleration.

The natural properties of Tensor, especially the memory-continuity and slice-independence, make it feasible for training system to leverage parallel computing unit like GPU to process data simultaneously in batch, spatial or temporal dimensions.

They are inconvenient and inefficient to program directly with conventional Tensor with fixed shape. To address this issue, we summarize two main computational patterns of nested data, and then propose a general nested data container: TreeTensor. Through various constraints and magic utilities of TreeTensor, one can apply arbitrary functions and operations to nested data with almost zero cost, including some famous machine learning libraries, such as Scikit-Learn, Numpy and PyTorch.

While multimodal foundation models excel at passive perception, their capacity for active, self-directed exploration remains understudied. We propose Theory of Space, defined as an agent's ability to actively acquire information through self-directed, active exploration and to construct, revise, and exploit a spatial belief from sequential, partial observations. We evaluate this through a benchmark where the goal is curiosity-driven exploration to build an accurate cognitive map. A key innovation is spatial belief probing, which prompts models to reveal their internal spatial representations at each step. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals several critical bottlenecks. First, we identify an Active-Passive Gap, where performance drops significantly when agents must autonomously gather information. Second, we find high inefficiency, as models explore unsystematically compared to program-based proxies. Through belief probing, we diagnose that while perception is an initial bottleneck, global beliefs suffer from instability that causes spatial knowledge to degrade over time. Finally, using a false belief paradigm, we uncover Belief Inertia, where agents fail to update obsolete priors with new evidence. This issue is present in text-based agents but is particularly severe in vision-based models. Our findings suggest that current foundation models struggle to maintain coherent, revisable spatial beliefs during active exploration."}

Adopting a two-agent game paradigm, a user agent constructs dynamic environments via style mimicry (learning user-specific conversational traits) and active termination (predicting turn-level termination probabilities as immediate rewards), forming an iterative cycle that drives the dialogue agent to deepen interest exploration. AT-GRPO reinterprets dialogue trajectories as trees and introduces adaptive observation ranges. Unlike full tree expansion that incurs exponential overhead, it limits each node to aggregate rewards from a stage-aware range: larger ranges support early-stage topic exploration, while smaller ranges facilitate late-stage dialogue maintenance. This design reduces rollout budgets from exponential to polynomial in the dialogue length, while preserving long-term reward capture.

We are the first to reformulate agentic CIR from a heuristic search process into a principled trajectory optimization problem.

These trajectories are then stored in a golden library to serve as in-context demonstrations for online steering of VLM planner at online inference time.

Neither humans nor single-agent LLMs can fully contend with this torrent of information, with the latter often prone to hallucinations.

We demonstrate that by tailoring graph traversal strategies, the system alternates between exploitative searches focusing on domain-critical outcomes and exploratory searches surfacing emergent cross-connections. Illustrated through the exemplar of biomedical tubing, the framework generates sustainable PFAS-free alternatives that balance tribological performance, thermal stability, chemical resistance, and biocompatibility.

In sequential decision making, efforts have been made towards personalization for different goals or values from demonstrations of diverse agents. However, these approaches demand manually designed features or lack value-based interpretability and/or adaptability to diverse user preferences.\n  We propose algorithms for learning models of value alignment and value systems for a society of agents in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), based on clustering and preference-based multi-objective reinforcement learning (PbMORL). We jointly learn socially-derived value alignment models (groundings) and a set of value systems that concisely represent different groups of users (clusters) in a society. Each cluster consists of a value system representing the value-based preferences of its members and an approximately Pareto-optimal policy that reflects behaviours aligned with this value system. We evaluate our method against a state-of-the-art PbMORL algorithm and baselines on two MDPs with human values."}

The controller consumes full-trace confidence to decide whether to halt, re-examine, or try a different approach, enabling targeted self-correction with an average of 2.7 refinement steps per problem and roughly 190-fold token reduction relative to 512-sample baselines.

We extend this to CoRefine-Tree, a hybrid sequential-parallel variant that adaptively balances exploration and exploitation, with easy serving integration and verifier compatibility. By treating confidence as a control signal rather than a correctness guarantee, CoRefine provides a modular primitive for scalable reasoning and agentic settings with imperfect verifiers."}

In this attack scenario, malicious commands hidden within untrusted content trick the agent into performing unauthorized actions. Existing defenses can reduce attack success but often suffer from the over-defense dilemma: they deploy expensive, always-on sanitization regardless of actual threat, thereby degrading utility and latency even in benign scenarios. We revisit IPI through a causal ablation perspective: a successful injection manifests as a dominance shift where the user request no longer provides decisive support for the agent's privileged action, while a particular untrusted segment, such as a retrieved document or tool output, provides disproportionate attributable influence. Based on this signature, we propose CausalArmor, a selective defense framework that (i) computes lightweight, leave-one-out ablation-based attributions at privileged decision points, and (ii) triggers targeted sanitization only when an untrusted segment dominates the user intent. Additionally, CausalArmor employs retroactive Chain-of-Thought masking to prevent the agent from acting on ``poisoned'' reasoning traces. We present a theoretical analysis showing that sanitization based on attribution margins conditionally yields an exponentially small upper bound on the probability of selecting malicious actions. Experiments on AgentDojo and DoomArena demonstrate that CausalArmor matches the security of aggressive defenses while improving explainability and preserving utility and latency of AI agents."}

To address these limitations, we introduce the Intelligent Virtual Situation Room (IVSR), a bidirectional Digital Twin (DT) platform augmented by autonomous AI agents. The IVSR continuously ingests multisource sensor imagery, weather data, and 3D forest models to create a live virtual replica of the fire environment. A similarity engine powered by AI aligns emerging conditions with a precomputed Disaster Simulation Library, retrieving and calibrating intervention tactics under the watchful eyes of experts. Authorized action-ranging from UAV redeployment to crew reallocation-is cycled back through standardized procedures to the physical layer, completing the loop between response and analysis. We validate IVSR through detailed case-study simulations provided by an industrial partner, demonstrating capabilities in localized incident detection, privacy-preserving playback, collider-based fire-spread projection, and site-specific ML retraining. Our results indicate marked reductions in detection-to-intervention latency and more effective resource coordination versus traditional systems. By uniting real-time bidirectional DTs with agentic AI, IVSR offers a scalable, semi-automated decision-support paradigm for proactive, adaptive wildfire disaster management."}

Stage 1 performs interpretable per-agent failure detection via Taylor-remainder analysis of policy-gradient costs, declaring an initial Patient-0 candidate at the first threshold crossing. Stage 2 provides validation through geometric analysis of critic derivatives-first-order sensitivity and directional second-order curvature aggregated over causal windows to construct interpretable contagion graphs. This approach explains \"downstream-first\" detection anomalies by revealing pathways that amplify upstream deviations. Evaluated across 500 episodes in Simple Spread (3 and 5 agents) and 100 episodes in StarCraft II using MADDPG and HATRPO, our method achieves 88.2-99.4% Patient-0 detection accuracy while providing interpretable geometric evidence for detection decisions.

To mitigate these instabilities, we propose a decentralized evaluation framework that enables hardware and parameter diversity through large-scale benchmarking across heterogeneous compute nodes. By leveraging the blockchain-based protocol, the framework incentivizes global contributors to act as independent validators, using a robust reward system to ensure evaluation integrity and discourage dishonest participation. This collective verification transforms evaluation from a \"centralized black box\" into a \"decentralized endorsement\" where multi-party consensus and diverse inference environments yield a more stable, representative metric. Experimental results demonstrate that the decentralized evaluation framework reduces the standard deviation across ten runs on the same model to 0.28. This significant improvement over conventional frameworks ensures higher statistical confidence in model rankings. We have completely implemented this platform and will soon release it to the community."}

Existing agent memory systems are typically designed within isolated paradigms (e.g., explicit, parametric, or latent memory) with tightly coupled retrieval methods that hinder cross-paradigm generalization and fusion. In this work, we take a first step toward unifying heterogeneous memory paradigms within a single memory system. We propose MemAdapter, a memory retrieval framework that enables fast alignment across agent memory paradigms. MemAdapter adopts a two-stage training strategy: (1) training a generative subgraph retriever from the unified memory space, and (2) adapting the retriever to unseen memory paradigms by training a lightweight alignment module through contrastive learning. This design improves the flexibility for memory retrieval and substantially reduces alignment cost across paradigms. Comprehensive experiments on three public evaluation benchmarks demonstrate that the generative subgraph retriever consistently outperforms five strong agent memory systems across three memory paradigms and agent model scales. Notably, MemAdapter completes cross-paradigm alignment within 13 minutes on a single GPU, achieving superior performance over original memory retrievers with less than 5% of training compute. Furthermore, MemAdapter enables effective zero-shot fusion across memory paradigms, highlighting its potential as a plug-and-play solution for agent memory systems."}

Current LLM research is dominated by a paradigm that relies heavily on unidirectional scaling of data size, increasingly encountering bottlenecks in data availability, acquisition cost, and training efficiency. In this work, we argue that the development of AGI is entering a new phase of data-model co-evolution, in which models actively guide data management while high-quality data, in turn, amplifies model capabilities. To implement this vision, we propose a tiered data management framework, designed to support the full LLM training lifecycle across heterogeneous learning objectives and cost constraints. Specifically, we introduce an L0-L4 tiered data management framework, ranging from raw uncurated resources to organized and verifiable knowledge. Importantly, LLMs are fully used in data management processes, such as quality scoring and content editing, to refine data across tiers. Each tier is characterized by distinct data properties, management strategies, and training roles, enabling data to be strategically allocated across LLM training stages, including pre-training, mid-training, and alignment. The framework balances data quality, acquisition cost, and marginal training benefit, providing a systematic approach to scalable and sustainable data management. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework through empirical studies, in which tiered datasets are constructed from raw corpora and used across multiple training phases. Experimental results demonstrate that tier-aware data utilization significantly improves training efficiency and model performance. To facilitate further research, we release our tiered datasets and processing tools to the community."}

Our core contribution is a tutor-apprentice dialogue where a deterministic Logic Tutor, grounded in a formal safety ontology, provides causal and pedagogical feedback to an LLM planner. This enables intelligent plan repairs rather than mere avoidance. We also introduce a scalable knowledge acquisition pipeline that synthesizes safety knowledge bases from real-world documents, correcting blind spots in existing benchmarks. In challenging home safety tasks, VIRF achieves a perfect 0 percent Hazardous Action Rate (HAR) and a 77.3 percent Goal-Condition Rate (GCR), which is the highest among all baselines.

Our model creates music that is emotionally and rhythmically synchronized with the video. A core component of EMSYNC is a novel video emotion classifier. By leveraging pretrained deep neural networks for feature extraction and keeping them frozen while training only fusion layers, we reduce computational complexity while improving accuracy. We show the generalization abilities of our method by obtaining state-of-the-art results on Ekman-6 and MovieNet. Another key contribution is a large-scale, emotion-labeled MIDI dataset for affective music generation. We then present an emotion-based MIDI generator, the first to condition on continuous emotional values rather than discrete categories, enabling nuanced music generation aligned with complex emotional content. To enhance temporal synchronization, we introduce a novel temporal boundary conditioning method, called \"boundary offset encodings,\" aligning musical chords with scene changes. Combining video emotion classification, emotion-based music generation, and temporal boundary conditioning, EMSYNC emerges as a fully automatic video-based music generator.

The most dominant approach to multi-agent cooperation is the utilitarian welfare which can produce efficient highly inequitable outcomes. This paper proposes a novel framework to foster fairer cooperation by replacing the standard utilitarian objective with Proportional Fairness. We introduce a fair altruistic utility for each agent, defined on the individual log-payoff space and derive the analytical conditions required to ensure cooperation in classic social dilemmas. We then extend this framework to sequential settings by defining a Fair Markov Game and deriving novel fair Actor-Critic algorithms to learn fair policies.

We reframe alignment evaluation as a problem of information flow under partial observability. Within this framework, we show that divergence between evaluation-time and deployment-time behavior is bounded by the mutual information between internal representations and the regime variable. Motivated by this result, we study regime-blind mechanisms: training-time interventions that reduce the extractability of regime information at decision-relevant internal representations via adversarial invariance. We evaluate this approach on a base, open-weight language model across two fully characterized failure modes -scientific sycophancy and temporal sleeper agents. Regime-blind training suppresses regime-conditioned behavior in both evaluated cases without measurable loss of task utility, but with qualitatively different dynamics: sycophancy exhibits a sharp representational and behavioral transition at low intervention strength, whereas sleeper-agent behavior requires substantially stronger pressure and does not exhibit a clean collapse of regime decodability. These results demonstrate that representational invariance is a meaningful but fundamentally limited control lever, whose effectiveness depends on how regime information is embedded in the policy. We argue that behavioral evaluation should be complemented with white-box diagnostics of regime awareness and information flow."}

Our system integrates a hierarchical self-adaptive scheduling mechanism that operates at both the overall orchestrator layer and workers layer. This mechanism can dynamically adjust computational intensity based on task complexity. It enables orchestrator to allocate one or more workers for parallel subtask execution, while workers can further improve operational efficiency by invoking tools concurrently. By virtue of this two-tier architecture, the system achieves synergistic balance between global task coordination and local task execution, thereby optimizing resource utilization and task processing efficiency in complex scenarios. To reduce context redundancy and increase information density during parallel steps, we adopt a three-tier progressive context management strategy. To make fuller use of historical information, we propose a self-evolving memory system, which can extract multi-dimensional valid information from all historical experiences to assist in completing similar tasks.

We find substantial variance: single-run pass@1 estimates vary by 2.2 to 6.0 percentage points depending on which run is selected, with standard deviations exceeding 1.5 percentage points even at temperature 0. This variance has critical implications: reported improvements of 2--3 percentage points may reflect evaluation noise rather than genuine algorithmic progress. Through token-level analysis, we show that trajectories diverge early, often within the first few percent of tokens, and that these small differences cascade into different solution strategies. To enable reliable evaluation of agentic systems, we recommend three concrete practices: (1) estimate pass@1 from multiple independent runs per task, especially when measuring small improvements, (2) use statistical power analysis to determine the number of runs needed to detect expected effect sizes, and (3) consider metrics like pass@k (optimistic bound) and pass^k (pessimistic bound) with k>1 to better characterize the full performance envelope. While these practices increase evaluation cost, they are essential for distinguishing genuine scientific progress from statistical noise."}

In sequential decision making, efforts have been made towards personalization for different goals or values from demonstrations of diverse agents.

We jointly learn socially-derived value alignment models (groundings) and a set of value systems that concisely represent different groups of users (clusters) in a society.

A particularly elegant way of interpreting SCMs is do-Shapley, a game-theoretic method of quantifying the average effect of $d$ variables across exponentially many interventions. Like Shapley values, computing do-Shapley values generally requires evaluating exponentially many terms. The foundation of our work is a reformulation of do-Shapley values in terms of the irreducible sets of the underlying SCM. Leveraging this insight, we can exactly compute do-Shapley values in time linear in the number of irreducible sets $r$, which itself can range from $d$ to $2^d$ depending on the graph structure of the SCM. Since $r$ is unknown a priori, we complement the exact algorithm with an estimator that, like general Shapley value estimators, can be run with any query budget. As the query budget approaches $r$, our estimators can produce more accurate estimates than prior methods by several orders of magnitude, and, when the budget reaches $r$, return the Shapley values up to machine precision. Beyond computational speed, we also reduce the identification burden: we prove that non-parametric identifiability of do-Shapley values requires only the identification of interventional effects for the $d$ singleton coalitions, rather than all classes."}

Prior work has explored correlating local policies via shared randomness, sometimes in the form of a correlation device, as a mechanism to assist in decentralized decision-making. In contrast, this work introduces the first framework for training MARL agents to exploit shared quantum entanglement as a coordination resource, which permits a larger class of communication-free correlated policies than shared randomness alone. This is motivated by well-known results in quantum physics which posit that, for certain single-round cooperative games with no communication, shared quantum entanglement enables strategies that outperform those that only use shared randomness. In such cases, we say that there is quantum advantage. Our framework is based on a novel differentiable policy parameterization that enables optimization over quantum measurements, together with a novel policy architecture that decomposes joint policies into a quantum coordinator and decentralized local actors. To illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we first show that we can learn, purely from experience, strategies that attain quantum advantage in single-round games that are treated as black box oracles. We then demonstrate how our machinery can learn policies with quantum advantage in an illustrative multi-agent sequential decision-making problem formulated as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP)."}

Yet in implicit-feedback, a single global temperature and equal treatment of uniformly sampled negatives can lead to brittle training, because sampled sets may contain varying degrees of relevant or informative competitors. The optimal loss sharpness for a user-item pair with a particular set of negatives, can be suboptimal or destabilising for another with different negatives. We introduce Dual-scale Softmax Loss (DSL), which infers effective sharpness from the sampled competition itself. DSL adds two complementary branches to the log-sum-exp backbone. Firstly it reweights negatives within each training instance using hardness and item--item similarity, secondly it adapts a per-example temperature from the competition intensity over a constructed competitor slate. Together, these components preserve the geometry of SL while reshaping the competition distribution across negatives and across examples.\n  Over several representative benchmarks and backbones, DSL yields substantial gains over strong baselines, with improvements over SL exceeding $10%$ in several settings and averaging $6.22%$ across datasets, metrics, and backbones. Under out-of-distribution (OOD) popularity shift, the gains are larger, with an average of $9.31%$ improvement over SL. We further provide a theoretical, distributionally robust optimisation (DRO) analysis, which demonstrates how DSL reshapes the robust payoff and the KL deviation for ambiguous instances.

We propose Collaborative Low-Rank Adaptation, or CoLoRA, which exploits task similarity to collaboratively and efficiently fine-tune personalized foundation models. The main idea in CoLoRA is to train one shared adapter capturing underlying task similarities across all tasks, and personalized adapters tailored to user-specific tasks. We theoretically study CoLoRA on heterogeneous linear regression and provide provable guarantees for ground truth recovery.

However, existing GNNs often struggle with heterophilic graphs, where connected nodes tend to have dissimilar features or labels. While numerous methods have been proposed to address this challenge, they primarily focus on architectural designs without directly targeting the root cause of the heterophily problem. These approaches still perform even worse than the simplest MLPs on challenging heterophilic datasets. For instance, our experiments show that 21 latest GNNs still fall behind the MLP on the Actor dataset. This critical challenge calls for an innovative approach to addressing graph heterophily beyond architectural designs. To bridge this gap, we propose and study a new and unexplored paradigm: directly increasing the graph homophily via a carefully designed graph transformation. In this work, we present a simple yet effective framework called GRAPHITE to address graph heterophily. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first method that explicitly transforms the graph to directly improve the graph homophily. Stemmed from the exact definition of homophily, our proposed GRAPHITE creates feature nodes to facilitate homophilic message passing between nodes that share similar features. Furthermore, we both theoretically and empirically show that our proposed GRAPHITE significantly increases the homophily of originally heterophilic graphs, with only a slight increase in the graph size. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets demonstrate that our proposed GRAPHITE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on heterophilic graphs while achieving comparable accuracy with state-of-the-art methods on homophilic graphs."}

LLM agents maintain working memory through their context window, which stores interaction history for decision-making. Conventional agents indiscriminately accumulate all tool outputs and reasoning traces in this memory, creating two critical vulnerabilities: (1) injected instructions persist throughout the workflow, granting attackers multiple opportunities to manipulate behavior, and (2) verbose, non-essential content degrades decision-making capabilities. Existing defenses treat bloated memory as given and focus on remaining resilient, rather than reducing unnecessary accumulation to prevent the attack.\n  We present AgentSys, a framework that defends against indirect prompt injection through explicit memory management. Inspired by process memory isolation in operating systems, AgentSys organizes agents hierarchically: a main agent spawns worker agents for tool calls, each running in an isolated context and able to spawn nested workers for subtasks. External data and subtask traces never enter the main agent's memory; only schema-validated return values can cross boundaries through deterministic JSON parsing. Ablations show isolation alone cuts attack success to 2.19%, and adding a validator/sanitizer further improves defense with event-triggered checks whose overhead scales with operations rather than context length.\n  On AgentDojo and ASB, AgentSys achieves 0.78% and 4.25% attack success while slightly improving benign utility over undefended baselines. It remains robust to adaptive attackers and across multiple foundation models, showing that explicit memory management enables secure, dynamic LLM agent architectures.

Existing mitigation strategies often face critical limitations: they either yield insufficient outlier suppression or incur significant deployment inefficiencies, such as inference latency, heavy preprocessing, or reliance on complex operator fusion. To resolve these limitations, we leverage a key insight: over-parameterized LLMs often converge to Flat Minima, implying a vast equivalent solution space where weights can be adjusted without compromising accuracy. Building on this, we propose Astro, an Activation-guided Structured Regularization framework designed to suppress the negative effects of outliers in a hardware-friendly and efficient manner. Leveraging the activation-guided regularization objective, Astro actively reconstructs intrinsically robust weights, aggressively suppressing weight outliers corresponding to high-magnitude activations without sacrificing model accuracy. Crucially, Astro introduces zero inference latency and is orthogonal to mainstream quantization methods like GPTQ. Extensive experiments show that Astro achieves highly competitive performance; notably, on LLaMA-2-7B, it achieves better performance than complex learning-based rotation methods with almost 1/3 of the quantization time."}

For linear residual networks, we show that the set of width- and depth-stable feature-learning parameterisations for PC is exactly the same as for BP. Moreover, under any of these parameterisations, the PC energy with equilibrated activities converges to the BP loss in a regime where the model width is much larger than the depth, resulting in PC computing the same gradients as BP. Experiments show that these results hold in practice for deep nonlinear networks, as long as an activity equilibrium seem to be reached. Overall, this work unifies various previous theoretical and empirical results and has potentially important implications for the scaling of PCNs."}

However, we report a counter-intuitive finding that these algorithmic latency attacks are largely ineffective against modern LLM serving systems. We reveal that system-level optimization such as continuous batching provides a logical isolation to mitigate contagious latency impact on co-located users. To this end, in this paper, we shift the focus from the algorithm to the system layer, and introduce a new Fill and Squeeze attack strategy targeting the state transition of the scheduler. \"Fill\" first exhausts the global KV cache to induce Head-of-Line blocking, while \"Squeeze\" forces the system into repetitive preemption. By manipulating output lengths using methods from simple plain-text prompts to more complex prompt engineering, and leveraging side-channel probing of memory status, we demonstrate that the attack can be orchestrated in a black-box setting with much less cost.

In this work, we propose a multi-task similarity measure based on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques, specifically Accumulated Local Effects (ALE) curves.\n  ALE curves are compared using the Fréchet distance, weighted by the data distribution, and the resulting similarity measure incorporates the importance of each feature. The measure is applicable in both single-task learning scenarios, where each task is trained separately, and multi-task learning scenarios, where all tasks are learned simultaneously. The measure is model-agnostic, allowing the use of different machine learning models across tasks. A scaling factor is introduced to account for differences in predictive performance across tasks, and several recommendations are provided for applying the measure in complex scenarios.\n  We validate this measure using four datasets, one synthetic dataset and three real-world datasets. The real-world datasets include a well-known Parkinson's dataset and a bike-sharing usage dataset -- both structured in tabular format -- as well as the CelebA dataset, which is used to evaluate the application of concept bottleneck encoders in a multitask learning setting.

It integrates permissioned blockchain (Hyperledger Fabric) with federated learning (FL). Built on Fabric, ICBAC uses a multi-channel architecture and three smart contracts for asset management, baseline access control, and dynamic revocation. To counter insider misuse, each channel deploys an AI agent that monitors activity and dynamically restricts access for anomalies. Federated learning allows these agents to collaboratively improve detection models without sharing raw data.\n  For heterogeneous, competitive environments, ICBAC introduces a game-theoretic client selection mechanism using hedonic coalition formation. This enables supply chains to form stable, strategy-proof FL coalitions via preference-based selection without disclosing sensitive criteria. Extensive experiments on a Fabric testbed with a real-world dataset show ICBAC achieves blockchain performance comparable to static frameworks and provides effective anomaly detection under IID and non-IID data with zero raw-data sharing.

However, existing threshold determination methods face critical challenges: analytical bounds are overly conservative, while probabilistic approaches like A-ABFT yield thresholds $160$--$4200\\times$ larger than actual rounding errors. We present V-ABFT, a variance-based adaptive threshold algorithm that achieves tighter error bounds by directly modeling the verification difference. By leveraging statistical variance estimation, V-ABFT reduces the threshold-to-actual-error ratio to approximately $7$--$20\\times$ for FP32/FP64 and $48$--$158\\times$ for BF16, representing a \\textbf{6--48$\\times$ improvement} over A-ABFT while maintaining zero false positive rate across BF16, FP16, FP32, and FP64 precisions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that for fused-kernel ABFT implementations that verify before output quantization, low-precision GEMM can use FP32-level thresholds ($e_{\\max} \\approx 10^{-6}$), enabling \\textbf{$\\sim$1000$\\times$ finer detection granularity} compared to offline verification with low-precision output ($e_{\\max} \\approx 10^{-3}$). We reproduce A-ABFT's experimental setup and validate our implementation against the original paper's results. Our method requires only $O(n)$ complexity using max/min/mean statistics, compared to A-ABFT's $O(pn)$ for finding $p$ largest values. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and real model weights (LLaMA-7B, GPT-2, ViT) demonstrate V-ABFT's effectiveness across diverse distributions. V-ABFT is platform-agnostic and has been integrated into fault-tolerant GEMM implementations on both NPUs and GPUs."}

In Alzheimers disease (AD), multimodal neuroimaging offers complementary signals but VAE-based normative models often (i) fit the healthy reference distribution imperfectly, inflating false positives, and (ii) use posterior aggregation (e.g., PoE/MoE) that can yield weak multimodal fusion in the shared latent space. We propose mmSIVAE, a multimodal soft-introspective variational autoencoder combined with Mixture-of-Product-of-Experts (MOPOE) aggregation to improve reference fidelity and multimodal integration. We compute deviation scores in latent space and feature space as distances from the learned healthy distributions, and map statistically significant latent deviations to regional abnormalities for interpretability. On ADNI MRI regional volumes and amyloid PET SUVR, mmSIVAE improves reconstruction on held-out controls and produces more discriminative deviation scores for outlier detection than VAE baselines, with higher likelihood ratios and clearer separation between control and AD-spectrum cohorts. Deviation maps highlight region-level patterns aligned with established AD-related changes. More broadly, our results highlight the importance of training objectives that prioritize reference-distribution fidelity and robust multimodal posterior aggregation for normative modeling, with implications for deviation-based analysis across multimodal clinical data."}

Through controlled cross-model evaluation on matched domains ($N=1000$, $T=0.3$, same General domain, hallucination rates 20--22\\%), we reveal the ``Loud Liar'' phenomenon: Llama 3.1 8B's failures are spectrally catastrophic and dramatically easier to detect, while Mistral 7B achieves the best discrimination (AUC 0.900).

Project page: https://konstantinosmitsides.github.io/dreaming-in-code", "summary": "Open-ended learning frames intelligence as emerging from continual interaction with an ever-expanding space of environments. While recent advances have utilized foundation models to programmatically generate diverse environments, these approaches often focus on discovering isolated behaviors rather than orchestrating sustained progression. In complex open-ended worlds, the large combinatorial space of possible challenges makes it difficult for agents to discover sequences of experiences that remain consistently learnable. To address this, we propose Dreaming in Code (DiCode), a framework in which foundation models synthesize executable environment code to scaffold learning toward increasing competence. In DiCode, \"dreaming\" takes the form of materializing code-level variations of the world. We instantiate DiCode in Craftax, a challenging open-ended benchmark characterized by rich mechanics and long-horizon progression. Empirically, DiCode enables agents to acquire long-horizon skills, achieving a $16\\%$ improvement in mean return over the strongest baseline and non-zero success on late-game combat tasks where prior methods fail. Our results suggest that code-level environment design provides a practical mechanism for curriculum control, enabling the construction of intermediate environments that bridge competence gaps in open-ended worlds.

Analysing the Learning Efficiency of Agentic Systems", "comment": null, "summary": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a crucial method for training or fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), enabling adaptive, task-specific optimizations through interactive feedback. Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), in particular, offers a promising avenue by decomposing complex tasks into specialized subtasks learned by distinct interacting agents, potentially enhancing the ability and efficiency of LLM systems. However, theoretical insights regarding when and why MARL outperforms Single-Agent RL (SARL) remain limited, creating uncertainty in selecting the appropriate RL framework. In this paper, we address this critical gap by rigorously analyzing the comparative sample efficiency of MARL and SARL within the context of LLM. Leveraging the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) framework, we formally define SARL and MARL setups for LLMs, derive explicit sample complexity bounds, and systematically characterize how task decomposition and alignment influence learning efficiency. Our results demonstrate that MARL improves sample complexity when tasks naturally decompose into independent subtasks, whereas dependent subtasks diminish MARL's comparative advantage. Additionally, we introduce and analyze the concept of task alignment, quantifying the trade-offs when enforcing independent task decomposition despite potential misalignments. These theoretical insights clarify empirical inconsistencies and provide practical criteria for deploying MARL strategies effectively in complex LLM scenarios."}

This framework advances upon prior methods, such as BSAFE, by primarily leveraging a Reinforcement Learning (RL) stage where models learn to dynamically correct their own generation errors. Through RL with critic feedback on the model's live outputs, LLMs are trained to identify and recover from their actual, emergent safety violations by emitting an efficient \"backtrack by x tokens\" signal, then continuing generation autoregressively. This RL process is crucial for instilling resilience against sophisticated adversarial strategies, including middle filling, Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) attacks, and decoding parameter manipulations. To further support the acquisition of this backtracking capability, we also propose an enhanced Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) data generation strategy (BSAFE+). This method improves upon previous data creation techniques by injecting violations into coherent, originally safe text, providing more effective initial training for the backtracking mechanism. Comprehensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that RLBF significantly reduces attack success rates across diverse benchmarks and model scales, achieving superior safety outcomes while critically preserving foundational model utility."}

However, individuals are inclined to defect in order to benefit from the group's cooperation without contributing the associated costs, thus leading to unfair situations. In game theory, social dilemmas entail this dichotomy between individual interest and collective outcome. The most dominant approach to multi-agent cooperation is the utilitarian welfare which can produce efficient highly inequitable outcomes. This paper proposes a novel framework to foster fairer cooperation by replacing the standard utilitarian objective with Proportional Fairness. We introduce a fair altruistic utility for each agent, defined on the individual log-payoff space and derive the analytical conditions required to ensure cooperation in classic social dilemmas. We then extend this framework to sequential settings by defining a Fair Markov Game and deriving novel fair Actor-Critic algorithms to learn fair policies. Finally, we evaluate our method in various social dilemma environments."}

We challenge this assumption by introducing implicit memory-the ability of a model to carry state across otherwise independent interactions by encoding information in its own outputs and later recovering it when those outputs are reintroduced as input. This mechanism does not require any explicit memory module, yet it creates a persistent information channel across inference requests. As a concrete demonstration, we introduce a new class of temporal backdoors, which we call time bombs. Unlike conventional backdoors that activate on a single trigger input, time bombs activate only after a sequence of interactions satisfies hidden conditions accumulated via implicit memory. We show that such behavior can be induced today through straightforward prompting or fine-tuning. Beyond this case study, we analyze broader implications of implicit memory, including covert inter-agent communication, benchmark contamination, targeted manipulation, and training-data poisoning. Finally, we discuss detection challenges and outline directions for stress-testing and evaluation, with the goal of anticipating and controlling future developments.

In this work, we theoretically pinpoint a key reason for training instability when extending group-based RL to multi-agent LLM systems. We show that under GRPO-style optimization, a global normalization baseline may deviate from diverse agents' reward distributions, which ultimately leads to gradient-norm instability. Based on this finding, we propose Dr. MAS, a simple and stable RL training recipe for multi-agent LLM systems. Dr. MAS uses an agent-wise remedy: normalizing advantages per agent using each agent's own reward statistics, which calibrates gradient scales and dramatically stabilizes training, both theoretically and empirically. Beyond the algorithm, Dr. MAS provides an end-to-end RL training framework for multi-agent LLM systems, supporting scalable orchestration, flexible per-agent LLM serving and optimization configs, and shared resource scheduling of LLM actor backends. We evaluate Dr. MAS on multi-agent math reasoning and multi-turn search benchmarks using Qwen2.5 and Qwen3 series models. Dr. MAS achieves clear gains over vanilla GRPO (e.g., +5.6\\% avg@16 and +4.6\\% pass@16 on math, and +15.2\\% avg@16 and +13.1\\% pass@16 on search) while largely eliminating gradient spikes.

We propose a framework for evaluating goal-directedness that integrates behavioural evaluation with interpretability-based analyses of models' internal representations. As a case study, we examine an LLM agent navigating a 2D grid world toward a goal state. Behaviourally, we evaluate the agent against an optimal policy across varying grid sizes, obstacle densities, and goal structures, finding that performance scales with task difficulty while remaining robust to difficulty-preserving transformations and complex goal structures. We then use probing methods to decode the agent's internal representations of the environment state and its multi-step action plans. We find that the LLM agent non-linearly encodes a coarse spatial map of the environment, preserving approximate task-relevant cues about its position and the goal location; that its actions are broadly consistent with these internal representations; and that reasoning reorganises them, shifting from broader environment structural cues toward information supporting immediate action selection. Our findings support the view that introspective examination is required beyond behavioural evaluations to characterise how agents represent and pursue their objectives."}

This difficulty partly arises from the natural rarity of certain classes (or hierarchical nodes) and the hierarchical constraint that ensures child nodes are almost always less frequent than their parents. To address this, we propose a weighted loss objective for neural networks that combines node-wise imbalance weighting with focal weighting components, the latter leveraging modern quantification of ensemble uncertainties. By emphasizing rare nodes rather than rare observations (data points), and focusing on uncertain nodes for each model output distribution during training, we observe improvements in recall by up to a factor of five on benchmark datasets, along with statistically significant gains in $F_{1}$ score. We also show our approach aids convolutional networks on challenging tasks, as in situations with suboptimal encoders or limited data."}
