Such\napplications promise benefits but also raise many questions about agent\naccountability and value for users. Addressing these questions requires\nunderstanding how agents behave in realistic market conditions. However,\nprevious research has largely evaluated agents in constrained settings, such as\nsingle-task marketplaces (e.g., negotiation) or structured two-agent\ninteractions. Real-world markets are fundamentally different: they require\nagents to handle diverse economic activities and coordinate within large,\ndynamic ecosystems where multiple agents with opaque behaviors may engage in\nopen-ended dialogues. To bridge this gap, we investigate two-sided agentic\nmarketplaces where Assistant agents represent consumers and Service agents\nrepresent competing businesses. To study these interactions safely, we develop\nMagentic-Marketplace -- a simulated environment where Assistants and Services\ncan operate. This environment enables us to study key market dynamics: the\nutility agents achieve, behavioral biases, vulnerability to manipulation, and\nhow search mechanisms shape market outcomes. Our experiments show that frontier\nmodels can approach optimal welfare -- but only under ideal search conditions.\nPerformance degrades sharply with scale, and all models exhibit severe\nfirst-proposal bias, creating 10-30x advantages for response speed over\nquality. These findings reveal how behaviors emerge across market conditions,\ninforming the design of fair and efficient agentic marketplaces.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00

The framework includes a\nself-interested market maker (Agent~A), which is trained in an uncertain\nenvironment shaped by an adversary, and three bottom-layer competitors: the\nself-interested Agent~B1 (whose objective is to maximize its own PnL), the\ncompetitive Agent~B2 (whose objective is to minimize the PnL of its opponent),\nand the hybrid Agent~B$^\\star$, which can modulate between the behavior of the\nother two. To analyze how these agents shape the behavior of each other and\naffect market outcomes, we propose interaction-level metrics that quantify\nbehavioral asymmetry and system-level dynamics, while providing signals\npotentially indicative of emergent interaction patterns.\n  Experimental results show that Agent~B2 secures dominant performance in a\nzero-sum setting against B1, aggressively capturing order flow while tightening\naverage spreads, thus improving market execution efficiency.

In resource-constrained\nsettings, agents optimizing for efficiency often create inequitable outcomes.\nOur approach leverages the action-value (Q-)function to balance efficiency and\nfairness without requiring additional training. Specifically, our method\ncomputes a local fairness gain for each action and introduces a counterfactual\nadvantage correction term to discourage over-allocation to already well-off\nagents. This approach is formalized within a centralized control setting, where\nan arbitrator uses the GIFF-modified Q-values to solve an allocation problem.\n  Empirical evaluations across diverse domains, including dynamic ridesharing,\nhomelessness prevention, and a complex job allocation task-demonstrate that our\nframework consistently outperforms strong baselines and can discover\nfar-sighted, equitable policies. The framework's effectiveness is supported by\na theoretical foundation; we prove its fairness surrogate is a principled lower\nbound on the true fairness improvement and that its trade-off parameter offers\nmonotonic tuning.

Current approaches either ignore these biases,\nleading to suboptimal decisions, or require expensive calibration procedures\nthat are often infeasible in practice. This performance gap has real\nconsequences: inaccurate environmental monitoring, unreliable financial\npredictions, and flawed aggregation of human judgments. This paper addresses\nthe fundamental question: when can we learn and correct for these unknown\nbiases to recover near-optimal performance, and when is such learning futile?\nWe develop a theoretical framework that decomposes biases into learnable\nsystematic components and irreducible stochastic components, introducing the\nconcept of learnability ratio as the fraction of bias variance predictable from\nobservable covariates. This ratio determines whether bias learning is\nworthwhile for a given system. We prove that the achievable performance\nimprovement is fundamentally bounded by this learnability ratio, providing\nsystem designers with quantitative guidance on when to invest in bias learning\nversus simpler approaches. We present the Adaptive Bias Learning and Optimal\nCombining (ABLOC) algorithm, which iteratively learns bias-correcting\ntransformations while optimizing combination weights through closedform\nsolutions, guaranteeing convergence to these theoretical bounds. Experimental\nvalidation demonstrates that systems with high learnability ratios can recover\nsignificant performance (we achieved 40%-70% of theoretical maximum improvement\nin our examples), while those with low learnability show minimal benefit,\nvalidating our diagnostic criteria for practical deployment decisions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud658\uacbd

While the Shortest Path First\n(SPF) algorithm is optimal for a single vehicle in a static network, it\nperforms poorly in dynamic, multi-vehicle settings, often worsening congestion\nby routing all vehicles along identical paths. We address dynamic vehicle\nrouting through a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for\ncoordinated, network-aware fleet navigation. We first propose Adaptive\nNavigation (AN), a decentralized MARL model where each intersection agent\nprovides routing guidance based on (i) local traffic and (ii) neighborhood\nstate modeled using Graph Attention Networks (GAT). To improve scalability in\nlarge networks, we further propose Hierarchical Hub-based Adaptive Navigation\n(HHAN), an extension of AN that assigns agents only to key intersections\n(hubs). Vehicles are routed hub-to-hub under agent control, while SPF handles\nmicro-routing within each hub region. For hub coordination, HHAN adopts\ncentralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) under the Attentive\nQ-Mixing (A-QMIX) framework, which aggregates asynchronous vehicle decisions\nvia attention. Hub agents use flow-aware state features that combine local\ncongestion and predictive dynamics for proactive routing. Experiments on\nsynthetic grids and real urban maps (Toronto, Manhattan) show that AN reduces\naverage travel time versus SPF and learning baselines, maintaining 100% routing\nsuccess.

To address this challenge, we propose\nleveraging autonomous, goal-driven AI agents for FinOps automation. In this\npaper, we built a FinOps agent for a typical use-case for IT infrastructure and\ncost optimization. We built a system simulating a realistic end-to-end industry\nprocess starting with retrieving data from various sources to consolidating and\nanalyzing the data to generate recommendations for optimization. We defined a\nset of metrics to evaluate our agent using several open-source and close-source\nlanguage models and it shows that the agent was able to understand, plan, and\nexecute tasks as well as an actual FinOps practitioner.", "AI": {"tldr": "FinOps \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uc790\uc728 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc911\uc2ec AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc2e4\uc81c \uc0b0\uc5c5 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \ubaa8\uc0ac\ud55c FinOps \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "motivation": "FinOps\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc \uc81c\uacf5\uc790 \ubc0f \ub0b4\ubd80 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc624\ub294 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ud615\uc2dd, \ubd84\ub958 \uccb4\uacc4, \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc758 \uccad\uad6c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc790\uc728 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc911\uc2ec AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec IT \uc778\ud504\ub77c \ubc0f \ube44\uc6a9 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc758\u5178\ud615\uc801 \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uc0ac\ub840\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c FinOps \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uace0, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ucd9c\ucc98\uc5d0\uc11c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uac00\uc838\uc624\uace0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ubd84\uc11d \ud6c4 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ucd94\ucc9c\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc5ec\ub7ec \uc624\ud508 \uc18c\uc2a4 \ubc0f \ud3d0\uc1c4\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \uc815\uc758\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc2e4\uc81c FinOps \uc2e4\ubb34\uc790\uc640 \uc720\uc0ac\ud558\uac8c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc774\ud574, \uacc4\ud68d \ubc0f \uc218\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 FinOps \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\uc758 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc \ube44\uc988\ub2c8\uc2a4 \uac00\uce58\ub97c \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "FinOps(\uc7ac\ubb34 + \uc6b4\uc601)\ub294 \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\ub9c1, \uc7ac\ubb34 \ubc0f \ube44\uc988\ub2c8\uc2a4 \ud300 \uac04\uc758 \ud611\ub825\uc801\uc778 \uc7ac\ubb34 \ucc45\uc784\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc \ube44\uc988\ub2c8\uc2a4 \uac00\uce58\ub97c \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc6b4\uc601 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c \ubc0f \ubb38\ud654\uc801 \uad00\ud589\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Kim"], "title": "PRESTO: Preimage-Informed Instruction Optimization for Prompting Black-Box LLMs", "comment": "Accepted to NeurIPS 2025", "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse\ndomains, due to their strong instruction-following capabilities. This has led\nto increasing interest in optimizing instructions for black-box LLMs, whose\ninternal parameters are inaccessible but widely used due to their strong\nperformance. To optimize instructions for black-box LLMs, recent methods employ\nwhite-box LLMs to generate candidate instructions from optimized soft prompts.\nHowever, white-box LLMs often map different soft prompts to the same\ninstruction, leading to redundant queries. While previous studies regarded this\nmany-to-one mapping as a structure that hinders optimization efficiency, we\nreinterpret it as a useful prior knowledge that can accelerate the\noptimization. To this end, we introduce PREimage-informed inSTruction\nOptimization (PRESTO), a novel framework that leverages the preimage structure\nof soft prompts for efficient optimization. PRESTO consists of three key\ncomponents: (1) score sharing, which shares the evaluation score with all soft\nprompts in a preimage; (2) preimage-based initialization, which selects initial\ndata points that maximize search space coverage using preimage information; and\n(3) score consistency regularization, which enforces prediction consistency\nwithin each preimage. By leveraging preimages, PRESTO achieves the effect of\neffectively obtaining 14 times more scored data under the same query budget,\nresulting in more efficient optimization. Experimental results on 33\ninstruction optimization tasks demonstrate the superior performance of PRESTO.\nCode is available at https://github.com/mlvlab/PRESTO", "AI": {"tldr": "PRESTO\ub294 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\uc758 \ud504\ub9ac\uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ub0b4\ubd80 \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130\uc5d0 \uc811\uadfc\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\uc9c0\ub9cc \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub41c \uc9c0\uc2dc\ubb38\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad00\uc2ec\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "PRESTO\ub294 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\uc758 \ud504\ub9ac\uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c\ub2e4: (1) \uc810\uc218 \uacf5\uc720, (2) \ud504\ub9ac\uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uae30\ubc18 \ucd08\uae30\ud654, (3) \uc810\uc218 \uc77c\uad00\uc131 \uc815\uaddc\ud654.", "result": "PRESTO\ub294 \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \ucffc\ub9ac \uc608\uc0b0 \ud558\uc5d0 14\ubc30 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc810\uc218 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud68d\ub4dd \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5b4 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "33\uac1c \uc9c0\uc2dc\ubb38 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc PRESTO\uc758 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc785\uc99d\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc740 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc9c0\uc2dc\uc0ac\ud56d \ub530\ub974\uae30 \ub2a5\ub825 \ub355\ubd84\uc5d0 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c remarkable success\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ub0b4\ubd80 \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130\uc5d0 \uc811\uadfc\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\uc9c0\ub9cc \ud0c1\uc6d4\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc73c\ub85c \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 LLM\uc758 \uc9c0\uc2dc\ubb38 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad00\uc2ec\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ucf30\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 LLM\uc758 \uc9c0\uc2dc\ubb38 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \ucd5c\uadfc\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub41c \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6c4\ubcf4 \uc9c0\uc2dc\ubb38\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud654\uc774\ud2b8\ubc15\uc2a4 LLM\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ud654\uc774\ud2b8\ubc15\uc2a4 LLM\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \uc9c0\uc2dc\ubb38\uc5d0 \ub9e4\ud551\ud558\uc5ec \uc911\ubcf5 \ucffc\ub9ac\ub97c \ubc1c\uc0dd\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uc804 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub4e4\uc740 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub2e4\ub300\uc77c \ub9e4\ud551\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ubc29\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\ub85c \uac04\uc8fc\ud588\uc73c\ub098, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\ub97c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c \uc0ac\uc804 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc7ac\ud574\uc11d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\uc758 \ud504\ub9ac\uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 PREimage-informed inSTruction Optimization (PRESTO)\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Specifically, we design a\ncentral agent that dynamically optimizes context length via temporal gradient\nanalysis, enhancing exploration to facilitate convergence to global optima in\nMARL. Furthermore, to enhance the adaptive optimization capability of the\ncontext length, we present an efficient input representation for the central\nagent, which effectively filters redundant information. By leveraging a\nFourier-based low-frequency truncation method, we extract global temporal\ntrends across decentralized agents, providing an effective and efficient\nrepresentation of the MARL environment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nthe proposed method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on long-term\ndependency tasks, including PettingZoo, MiniGrid, Google Research Football\n(GRF), and StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge v2 (SMACv2).", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ub9e5\ub77d \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc5bb\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc774 \uc7a5\uae30 \uc758\uc874\uc131 \ubc0f \ube44\ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \ud658\uacbd\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uace0 \uc788\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc911\uc559 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uc5ec \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub9e5\ub77d \uae38\uc774\ub97c \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 PettingZoo, MiniGrid, Google Research Football (GRF), StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge v2 (SMACv2)\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc7a5\uae30 \uc758\uc874\uc131 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud658\uacbd\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc \uc2ec\uce35 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(MARL)\uc740 \uc7a5\uae30 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uacfc \ube44\ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \ud658\uacbd\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc778 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8 \uc131\uacf5\uc740 \uc8fc\ub85c \ud070 \uace0\uc815 \ub9e5\ub77d \uae38\uc774\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc815\ucc45 \uc870\uac74\ud654\uc5d0 \uae30\uc778\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud070 \uace0\uc815 \ub9e5\ub77d \uae38\uc774\ub294 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc911\ubcf5 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ub9e5\ub77d \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc5bb\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 MARL \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub9e5\ub77d \uae38\uc774\ub97c \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc911\uc559 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uc5ec \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud558\uace0 MARL\uc5d0\uc11c \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ucd5c\uc801\uc5d0 \uc218\ub834\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \ub9e5\ub77d \uae38\uc774\uc758 \uc801\uc751\uc801 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc911\uc559 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc785\ub825 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc911\ubcf5 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud544\ud130\ub9c1\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud478\ub9ac\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18 \uc800\uc8fc\ud30c \uc808\ub2e8 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubd84\uc0b0\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc744 \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\uace0, MARL \ud658\uacbd\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 PettingZoo, MiniGrid, Google Research Football(GRF), StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge v2(SMACv2)\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc7a5\uae30 \uc758\uc874\uc131 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

For\nexample, people's attention to objects in their environment will be biased in a\nway that systematically affects how they perform everyday tasks such as driving\nto work. Here, building on recent work in computational cognitive science, we\nformally articulate the attention-aware inverse planning problem, in which the\ngoal is to estimate a person's attentional biases from their actions.

While large language models\nhave been applied to energy systems as code generators and parameter\nextractors, no existing implementation deploys LLMs as autonomous coordinators\nmanaging the complete workflow from natural language input to multi-appliance\nscheduling.

A\nhierarchical architecture combining one orchestrator with three specialist\nagents uses the ReAct pattern for iterative reasoning, enabling dynamic\ncoordination without hardcoded workflows while integrating Google Calendar for\ncontext-aware deadline extraction. Evaluation across three open-source models\nusing real Austrian day-ahead electricity prices reveals substantial capability\ndifferences. Llama-3.3-70B successfully coordinates all appliances across all\nscenarios to match cost-optimal benchmarks computed via mixed-integer linear\nprogramming, while other models achieve perfect single-appliance performance\nbut struggle to coordinate all appliances simultaneously.

We\npresent FakeZero, a fully client-side, cross-platform browser extension that\nflags unreliable posts on Facebook and X (formerly Twitter) while the user\nscrolls. All computation, DOM scraping, tokenisation, Transformer inference,\nand UI rendering run locally through the Chromium messaging API, so no personal\ndata leaves the device.FakeZero employs a three-stage training curriculum:\nbaseline fine-tuning and domain-adaptive training enhanced with focal loss,\nadversarial augmentation, and post-training quantisation. Evaluated on a\ndataset of 239,000 posts, the DistilBERT-Quant model (67.6 MB) reaches 97.1%\nmacro-F1, 97.4% accuracy, and an AUROC of 0.996, with a median latency of\napproximately 103 ms on a commodity laptop. A memory-efficient TinyBERT-Quant\nvariant retains 95.7% macro-F1 and 96.1% accuracy while shrinking the model to\n14.7 MB and lowering latency to approximately 40 ms, showing that high-quality\nfake-news detection is feasible under tight resource budgets with only modest\nperformance loss.By providing inline credibility cues, the extension can serve\nas a valuable tool for policymakers seeking to curb the spread of\nmisinformation across social networks.

Yet existing systems struggle with realistic spatio-temporal queries,\nwhere success requires aligning vague user phrasing with schema-specific\ncategories, handling temporal reasoning, and choosing appropriate outputs. We\npresent an agentic pipeline that extends a naive text-to-SQL baseline\n(llama-3-sqlcoder-8b) with orchestration by a Mistral-based ReAct agent. The\nagent can plan, decompose, and adapt queries through schema inspection, SQL\ngeneration, execution, and visualization tools. We evaluate on 35\nnatural-language queries over the NYC and Tokyo check-in dataset, covering\nspatial, temporal, and multi-dataset reasoning. The agent achieves\nsubstantially higher accuracy than the naive baseline 91.4% vs. 28.6% and\nenhances usability through maps, plots, and structured natural-language\nsummaries. Crucially, our design enables more natural human-database\ninteraction, supporting users who lack SQL expertise, detailed schema\nknowledge, or prompting skill. We conclude that agentic orchestration, rather\nthan stronger SQL generators alone, is a promising foundation for interactive\ngeospatial assistants.", "AI": {"tldr": "NL-to-SQL

Although recent work explores using\nreinforcement learning (RL) to automate the laborious data collection process\nin scaling supervised fine-tuning (SFT), applying large-scale RL to flow-based\nVLAs (e.g., $\\pi_0$, $\\pi_{0.5}$) remains challenging due to intractable action\nlog-likelihoods from iterative denoising.\n  We address this challenge with $\\pi_{\\text{RL}}$, an open-source framework\nfor training flow-based VLAs in parallel simulation. $\\pi_{\\text{RL}}$\nimplements two RL algorithms: (1) {Flow-Noise} models the denoising process as\na discrete-time MDP with a learnable noise network for exact log-likelihood\ncomputation. (2) {Flow-SDE} integrates denoising with agent-environment\ninteraction, formulating a two-layer MDP that employs ODE-to-SDE conversion for\nefficient RL exploration.\n  We evaluate $\\pi_{\\text{RL}}$ on LIBERO and ManiSkill benchmarks. On LIBERO,\n$\\pi_{\\text{RL}}$ boosts few-shot SFT models $\\pi_0$ and $\\pi_{0.5}$ from 57.6%\nto 97.6% and from 77.1% to 98.3%, respectively.

We present SIRAJ: a generic\nred-teaming framework for arbitrary black-box LLM agents. We employ a dynamic\ntwo-step process that starts with an agent definition and generates diverse\nseed test cases that cover various risk outcomes, tool-use trajectories, and\nrisk sources. Then, it iteratively constructs and refines model-based\nadversarial attacks based on the execution trajectories of former attempts. To\noptimize the red-teaming cost, we present a model distillation approach that\nleverages structured forms of a teacher model's reasoning to train smaller\nmodels that are equally effective.

If this\npowerful AI is to serve the needs of consumers, voters, and decision makers,\nthen it is imperative that the AI is accountable.

The prevailing security\nparadigm for these platforms is overwhelmingly focused on pre-transaction\nauthentication, preventing unauthorized payments before they occur. We argue\nthat a critical vulnerability vector has been largely overlooked: the fragility\nof post-transaction audit trails. We investigate the ease with which a user can\npermanently erase their transaction history from an app's interface, thereby\nconcealing unauthorized or sensitive activities from the account owner. To\nquantify this threat, we conducted an empirical study with 6 volunteers who\nperformed a cross-evaluation on six super apps. Our findings are alarming: all\nsix applications studied allow users to delete transaction records, yet a\nstaggering five out of six (83+\\%) fail to protect these records with strong\nauthentication. Only one app in our study required biometric verification for\ndeletion.

We hypothesize this gap\nstems from missing core GUI knowledge, which existing training schemes (such as\nsupervised fine tuning and reinforcement learning) alone cannot fully address.\nBy analyzing common failure patterns in GUI task execution, we distill GUI\nknowledge into three dimensions: (1) interface perception, knowledge about\nrecognizing widgets and system states; (2) interaction prediction, knowledge\nabout reasoning action state transitions; and (3) instruction understanding,\nknowledge about planning, verifying, and assessing task completion progress. We\nfurther introduce GUI Knowledge Bench, a benchmark with multiple choice and\nyes/no questions across six platforms (Web, Android, MacOS, Windows, Linux,\nIOS) and 292 applications.

Traditional backpropagation, while\neffective, conflicts with biological plausibility principles and may be\nsuboptimal for continuous adaptation scenarios. The Predictive Coding (PC)\nframework offers a biologically plausible alternative with local, Hebbian-like\nupdate rules, making it suitable for neuromorphic hardware implementation.\nHowever, PC's main limitation is its computational overhead due to multiple\ninference iterations during training. We present Predictive Coding Network with\nTemporal Amortization (PCN-TA), which preserves latent states across temporal\nframes. By leveraging temporal correlations, PCN-TA significantly reduces\ncomputational demands while maintaining learning performance. Our experiments\non the COIL-20 robotic perception dataset demonstrate that PCN-TA achieves 10%\nfewer weight updates compared to backpropagation and requires 50% fewer\ninference steps than baseline PC networks. These efficiency gains directly\ntranslate to reduced computational overhead for moving another step toward edge\ndeployment and real-time adaptation support in resource-constrained robotic\nsystems.

However, their reliance on\nover-privileged, static permissions creates a critical vulnerability:\ninstruction injection. Malicious instructions, embedded in otherwise benign\ncontent like emails, can hijack the agent to perform unauthorized actions. We\npresent AgentSentry, a lightweight runtime task-centric access control\nframework that enforces dynamic, task-scoped permissions. Instead of granting\nbroad, persistent permissions, AgentSentry dynamically generates and enforces\nminimal, temporary policies aligned with the user's specific task (e.g.,\nregister for an app), revoking them upon completion. We demonstrate that\nAgentSentry successfully prevents an instruction injection attack, where an\nagent is tricked into forwarding private emails, while allowing the legitimate\ntask to complete.

In this paper, we propose a\ndeep reinforcement learning (DRL)-empowered multi-level jamming approach to\nenhance the security of SemCom systems over MIMO fading wiretap channels. This\napproach combines semantic layer jamming, achieved by encoding task-irrelevant\ntext, and physical layer jamming, achieved by encoding random Gaussian noise.\nThese two-level jamming signals are superposed with task-relevant semantic\ninformation to protect the transmitted semantics from eavesdropping. A deep\ndeterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm is further introduced to\ndynamically design and optimize the precoding matrices for both taskrelevant\nsemantic information and multi-level jamming signals, aiming to enhance the\nlegitimate user's image reconstruction while degrading the eavesdropper's\nperformance. To jointly train the SemCom model and the DDPG agent, we propose\nan alternating optimization strategy where the two modules are updated\niteratively. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with both the\nencryption-based (ESCS) and encoded jammer-based (EJ) benchmarks, our method\nachieves comparable security while improving the legitimate user's peak\nsignalto-noise ratio (PSNR) by up to approximately 0.6 dB.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 MIMO \ud398\uc774\ub529 \ub3c4\uccad \ucc44\ub110\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ubcf4\uc548\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc2ec\uce35 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ubc29\ud574 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \ud1b5\uc2e0(SemCom)\uc740 \uc791\uc5c5\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ub41c \uc815\ubcf4\ub9cc \uc804\uc1a1\ud558\uc5ec \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc758\ubbf8 \uc815\ubcf4\uac00 \ub3c4\uccad\uc5d0 \ub178\ucd9c\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc704\ud5d8\ub3c4 \uc874\uc7ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc791\uc5c5\uacfc \uad00\ub828 \uc5c6\ub294 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ud558\uc5ec \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4 \ubc29\ud574\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud558\uace0, \ubb34\uc791\uc704 \uac00\uc6b0\uc2dc\uc548 \ub178\uc774\uc988\ub97c \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ud558\uc5ec \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4 \ubc29\ud574\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub808\ubca8\uc758 \ubc29\ud574 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc554\ud638 \uae30\ubc18(ESCS) \ubc0f \uc778\ucf54\ub529 \ubc29\ud574 \uc7a5\uce58 \uae30\ubc18(EJ) \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc640 \ube44\uad50\ud588\uc744 \ub54c \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \ubcf4\uc548\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ud569\ubc95\uc801 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc758 \ucd5c\ub300 \uc2e0\ud638 \ub300 \uc7a1\uc74c \ube44\uc728(PSNR)\uc744 \uc57d 0.6 dB\uae4c\uc9c0 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b4\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc2ec\uce35 \uacb0\uc815\uc801 \uc815\ucc45 \uacbd\ub7c9\ud654(DDPG) \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc791\uc5c5 \uad00\ub828 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc815\ubcf4\uc640 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ubc29\ud574 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud504\ub9ac\ucf54\ub529 \ub9e4\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc2a4\ub97c \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uace0 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \ud1b5\uc2e0(SemCom)\uc740 \uc791\uc5c5\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ub41c \uc815\ubcf4\ub9cc\uc744 \uc804\uc1a1\ud558\uc5ec \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ub610\ud55c \uc758\ubbf8 \uc815\ubcf4\uac00 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uccad\uc5d0 \ub178\ucd9c\ub418\ub294 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ub3d9\ubc18\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 MIMO \ud398\uc774\ub529 \ub3c4\uccad \ucc44\ub110\uc5d0\uc11c SemCom \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc2ec\uce35 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(DRL) \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ubc29\ud574 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc791\uc5c5\uacfc \uad00\ub828 \uc5c6\ub294 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ud558\uc5ec \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4 \ubc29\ud574\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud558\uace0, \ubb34\uc791\uc704 \uac00\uc6b0\uc2dc\uc548 \ub178\uc774\uc988\ub97c \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ud558\uc5ec \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4 \ubc29\ud574\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub808\ubca8\uc758 \ubc29\ud574 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub450 \ub808\ubca8\uc758 \ubc29\ud574 \uc2e0\ud638\ub294 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc911\uc778 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc791\uc5c5\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ub41c \uc758\ubbf8 \uc815\ubcf4\uc640 \uc911\ucca9\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc2ec\uce35 \uacb0\uc815\uc801 \uc815\ucc45 \uacbd\ub7c9\ud654(DDPG) \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc791\uc5c5 \uad00\ub828 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc815\ubcf4\uc640 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ubc29\ud574 \uc2e0\ud638\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud504\ub9ac\ucf54\ub529 \ub9e4\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc2a4\ub97c \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uace0 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \ud569\ubc95\uc801 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc758 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \ub3c4\uccad\uc790\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc800\ud558\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Yet in the domain of tool learning, the lack of\nRMs specifically designed for function-calling tasks has limited progress\ntoward more capable agentic AI. We introduce ToolRM, a family of lightweight\ngenerative RMs tailored for general tool-use scenarios. To build these models,\nwe propose a novel pipeline that constructs pairwise preference data using\nrule-based scoring and multidimensional sampling. This yields\nToolPref-Pairwise-30K, a diverse, balanced, and challenging dataset of critique\ntasks that supports reinforcement learning with verifiable feedback. To\nevaluate tool-use RMs, we also introduce TRBench$_{BFCL}$, a benchmark built on\nthe agentic evaluation suite BFCL. Trained on our constructed data, models from\nthe Qwen3-4B/8B series achieve up to 14.28% higher accuracy, substantially\noutperforming frontier models such as Claude 4 and OpenAI o3 in pairwise reward\njudgments.

We conduct experiments on both general language\ntasks and specialized medical tasks. On a variety of natural language modeling\nbenchmarks, Nirvana achieves competitive or superior results compared to the\nexisting LLM structures. To prove the effectiveness of Trigger on specialized\ntasks, we test Nirvana's performance on a challenging medical task, i.e.,\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). We post-train frozen Nirvana backbone with\nlightweight codecs on paired electromagnetic signals and MRI images. Despite\nthe frozen Nirvana backbone, Trigger guides the model to adapt to the MRI\ndomain with the change of task-related parameters.

Large Language\nModels (LLMs) emerge as promising approaches for TSC. However, they are prone\nto hallucinations in emergencies, leading to unreliable decisions that may\ncause substantial delays for emergency vehicles. Moreover, diverse intersection\ntypes present substantial challenges for traffic state encoding and\ncross-intersection training, limiting generalization across heterogeneous\nintersections. Therefore, this paper proposes Retrieval Augmented Generation\n(RAG)-enhanced distributed LLM agents with Emergency response for Generalizable\nTSC (REG-TSC). Firstly, this paper presents an emergency-aware reasoning\nframework, which dynamically adjusts reasoning depth based on the emergency\nscenario and is equipped with a novel Reviewer-based Emergency RAG (RERAG) to\ndistill specific knowledge and guidance from historical cases, enhancing the\nreliability and rationality of agents' emergency decisions. Secondly, this\npaper designs a type-agnostic traffic representation and proposes a\nReward-guided Reinforced Refinement (R3) for heterogeneous intersections. R3\nadaptively samples training experience from diverse intersections with\nenvironment feedback-based priority and fine-tunes LLM agents with a designed\nreward-weighted likelihood loss, guiding REG-TSC toward high-reward policies\nacross heterogeneous intersections. On three real-world road networks with 17\nto 177 heterogeneous intersections, extensive experiments show that REG-TSC\nreduces travel time by 42.00%, queue length by 62.31%, and emergency vehicle\nwaiting time by 83.16%, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uad50\ucc28\ub85c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \uacb0\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uae34\uae09 \ucc28\ub7c9 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ube44\uc0c1 \ub300\uc751 \uae30\ub2a5\uc774 \uac15\ud654\ub41c \ubd84\uc0b0 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub3c4\uc2dc\uc758 \uad50\ud1b5 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \uad50\ud1b5 \uc2e0\ud638 \uc81c\uc5b4(TSC)\uac00 \uad50\ud1b5 \ud750\ub984\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uace0 \ub3c4\ub85c \uc548\uc804\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\ube44\uc0c1 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \uc0ac\uace0 \uae4a\uc774\ub97c \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc0ac\uace0 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uace0, \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801 \uc0ac\ub840\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uacfc \uc9c0\uce68\uc744 \uc99d\ub958\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 Reviewer \uae30\ubc18 \ube44\uc0c1 RAG\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, REG-TSC\ub294 3\uac1c\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \ub3c4\ub85c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5ec\ud589 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 42.00%, \ub300\uae30\uc5f4 \uae38\uc774\ub97c 62.31%, \uae34\uae09 \ucc28\ub7c9 \ub300\uae30 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 83.16% \ub2e8\ucd95\uc2dc\ucf30\uc73c\uba70, \ub2e4\ub978 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "REG-TSC\ub294 \uc774\uc885 \uad50\ucc28\ub85c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub192\uc740 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc815\ucc45\uc73c\ub85c \uc548\ub0b4\ud558\uc5ec \uad50\ud1b5 \uc2e0\ud638 \uc81c\uc5b4\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub3c4\uc2dc \uad50\ud1b5\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \uad50\ud1b5 \uc2e0\ud638 \uc81c\uc5b4(TSC)\ub294 \uad50\ud1b5 \ud750\ub984\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uace0 \ub3c4\ub85c \uc548\uc804\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 TSC\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \ubd80\uc0c1\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub4e4\uc740 \ube44\uc0c1 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c \ud658\uac01\uc744 \uc77c\uc73c\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc5b4, \uae34\uae09 \ucc28\ub7c9\uc5d0 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud558\ub294 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ub0b4\ub9b4 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uac8c\ub2e4\uac00 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uad50\ucc28\ub85c \uc720\ud615\uc740 \uad50\ud1b5 \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc778\ucf54\ub529 \ubc0f \uad50\ucc28 \uad50\ucc28\ub85c \uad50\uc721\uc5d0 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\uc885 \uad50\ucc28\ub85c \uac04\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \uc81c\ud55c\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ube44\uc0c1 \ub300\uc751 \uae30\ub2a5\uc774 \uac15\ud654\ub41c Retrieval Augmented Generation(RAG)\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \ubd84\uc0b0 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc778 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c TSC(\uc774\ub77c\uace0 \ubd88\ub9ac\ub294 REG-TSC)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uccab\uc9f8, \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ube44\uc0c1 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc778\uc2dd \uae30\ubc18 \uc0ac\uace0 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ube44\uc0c1 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc0ac\uace0 \uae4a\uc774\ub97c \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc815\ud558\uace0, \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801 \uc0ac\ub840\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc9c0\uc2dd \ubc0f \uc9c0\uce68\uc744 \uc99d\ub958\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 Reviewer \uae30\ubc18 \ube44\uc0c1 RAG(RERAG)\ub97c \uc7a5\ucc29\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ube44\uc0c1 \uacb0\uc815\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uacfc \ud569\ub9ac\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4. \ub458\uc9f8, \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc720\ud615 \ubb34\uad00\ud55c \uad50\ud1b5 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uace0 \uc774\uc885 \uad50\ucc28\ub85c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uae30\ubc18 \uac15\ud654 \uc815\uc81c(Reward-guided Reinforced Refinement, R3)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

Yet, when applied to train\nmulti-turn, interactive LLM agents, these methods often suffer from structural\nblindness-the inability to exploit the underlying connectivity of the\nenvironment. This manifests in three critical challenges: (1) inefficient,\nunguided exploration, (2) imprecise credit assignment due to overlooking\npivotal states, and (3) myopic planning caused by static reward discounting. We\naddress these issues with Graph-Enhanced Policy Optimization (GEPO), which\ndynamically constructs a state-transition graph from agent experience and\nemploys graph-theoretic centrality to provide three synergistic learning\nsignals: (1)structured intrinsic rewards that guide exploration toward\nhigh-impact states, (2) a graph-enhanced advantage function for topology-aware\ncredit assignment, and (3) a dynamic discount factor adapted to each state's\nstrategic value. On the ALFWorld, WebShop, and a proprietary Workbench\nbenchmarks, GEPO demonstrates strong performance, achieving absolute success\nrate gains of +4.1%, +5.3%, and +10.9% over competitive baselines.

This amounts to\naveraging performance geospatially across the Earth in weather and climate\nsettings, failing to account for the non-uniform distribution of human\ndevelopment and geography. We introduce Stratified Assessments of Forecasts\nover Earth (SAFE), a package for elucidating the stratified performance of a\nset of predictions made over Earth. SAFE integrates various data domains to\nstratify by different attributes associated with geospatial gridpoints:\nterritory (usually country), global subregion, income, and landcover (land or\nwater). This allows us to examine the performance of models for each individual\nstratum of the different attributes (e.g., the accuracy in every individual\ncountry). To demonstrate its importance, we utilize SAFE to benchmark a zoo of\nstate-of-the-art AI-based weather prediction models, finding that they all\nexhibit disparities in forecasting skill across every attribute. We use this to\nseed a benchmark of model forecast fairness through stratification at different\nlead times for various climatic variables. By moving beyond globally-averaged\nmetrics, we for the first time ask: where do models perform best or worst, and\nwhich models are most fair?

Bean", "Nabeel Seedat", "Shengzhuang Chen", "Jonathan Richard Schwarz"], "title": "Scales++: Compute Efficient Evaluation Subset Selection with Cognitive Scales Embeddings", "comment": "9 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables", "summary": "The prohibitive cost of evaluating large language models (LLMs) on\ncomprehensive benchmarks necessitates the creation of small yet representative\ndata subsets (i.e., tiny benchmarks) that enable efficient assessment while\nretaining predictive fidelity. Current methods for this task operate under a\nmodel-centric paradigm, selecting benchmarking items based on the collective\nperformance of existing models. Such approaches are limited by large upfront\ncosts, an inability to immediately handle new benchmarks (`cold-start'), and\nthe fragile assumption that future models will share the failure patterns of\ntheir predecessors. In this work, we challenge this paradigm and propose a\nitem-centric approach to benchmark subset selection, arguing that selection\nshould be based on the intrinsic properties of the task items themselves,\nrather than on model-specific failure patterns. We instantiate this\nitem-centric efficient benchmarking approach via a novel method, Scales++,\nwhere data selection is based on the cognitive demands of the benchmark\nsamples.

Bileschi"], "title": "A Pragmatic View of AI Personhood", "comment": "40 pages", "summary": "The emergence of agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) is set to trigger a\n\"Cambrian explosion\" of new kinds of personhood. This paper proposes a\npragmatic framework for navigating this diversification by treating personhood\nnot as a metaphysical property to be discovered, but as a flexible bundle of\nobligations (rights and responsibilities) that societies confer upon entities\nfor a variety of reasons, especially to solve concrete governance problems. We\nargue that this traditional bundle can be unbundled, creating bespoke solutions\nfor different contexts. This will allow for the creation of practical tools --\nsuch as facilitating AI contracting by creating a target \"individual\" that can\nbe sanctioned -- without needing to resolve intractable debates about an AI's\nconsciousness or rationality. We explore how individuals fit in to social roles\nand discuss the use of decentralized digital identity technology, examining\nboth \"personhood as a problem\", where design choices can create \"dark patterns\"\nthat exploit human social heuristics, and \"personhood as a solution\", where\nconferring a bundle of obligations is necessary to ensure accountability or\nprevent conflict.

With the advent of computers\nand artificial intelligence, these contexts are no longer limited to purely\nhuman--human interactions: human--machine interactions are included as well.\nThen a central question emerges: How can machines better understand our\nsituations and purposes? To address this challenge, researchers have recently\nintroduced the concept of context engineering. Although it is often regarded as\na recent innovation of the agent era, we argue that related practices can be\ntraced back more than twenty years. Since the early 1990s, the field has\nevolved through distinct historical phases, each shaped by the intelligence\nlevel of machines: from early human--computer interaction frameworks built\naround primitive computers, to today's human--agent interaction paradigms\ndriven by intelligent agents, and potentially to human--level or superhuman\nintelligence in the future. In this paper, we situate context engineering,\nprovide a systematic definition, outline its historical and conceptual\nlandscape, and examine key design considerations for practice. By addressing\nthese questions, we aim to offer a conceptual foundation for context\nengineering and sketch its promising future.

Yet, their accurate\nand efficient forecast remains a persistent challenge for numerical weather\nprediction (NWP) systems due to limitations in physical representation,\ninitialization, and the immense computational demands of ensemble forecasts.\nWhile data-driven forecasting is rapidly evolving, its application to the\ncomplex, three-dimensional dynamics of SSWs, particularly for probabilistic\nforecast, remains underexplored. Here, we bridge this gap by developing a Flow\nMatching-based generative AI model (FM-Cast) for efficient and skillful\nprobabilistic forecasting of the spatiotemporal evolution of stratospheric\ncirculation. Evaluated across 18 major SSW events (1998-2024), FM-Cast\nskillfully forecasts the onset, intensity, and morphology of 10 events up to 20\ndays in advance, achieving ensemble accuracies above 50%. Its performance is\ncomparable to or exceeds leading NWP systems while requiring only two minutes\nfor a 50-member, 30-day forecast on a consumer GPU. Furthermore, leveraging\nFM-Cast as a scientific tool, we demonstrate through idealized experiments that\nSSW predictability is fundamentally linked to its underlying physical drivers,\ndistinguishing between events forced from the troposphere and those driven by\ninternal stratospheric dynamics. Our work thus establishes a computationally\nefficient paradigm for probabilistic forecasting stratospheric anomalies and\nshowcases generative AI's potential to deepen the physical understanding

Special attention is given to emerging TWSVM extensions for\nmulti-task settings, which show promise but remain underexplored. We compare\nthese models in terms of theoretical properties, optimization strategies, and\nempirical performance, and discuss applications in fields such as computer\nvision, natural language processing, and bioinformatics.\n  Finally, we identify research gaps and outline future directions for building\nscalable, interpretable, and reliable margin-based MTL frameworks.

We\nstudy a minimal control interface where an agent chooses whether to act\nautonomously (play) or defer (ask), while a human simultaneously chooses\nwhether to be permissive (trust) or to engage in oversight (oversee). If the\nagent defers, the human's choice determines the outcome, potentially leading to\na corrective action or a system shutdown. We model this interaction as a\ntwo-player Markov Game. Our analysis focuses on cases where this game qualifies\nas a Markov Potential Game (MPG), a class of games where we can provide an\nalignment guarantee: under a structural assumption on the human's value\nfunction, any decision by the agent to act more autonomously that benefits\nitself cannot harm the human's value. We also analyze extensions to this MPG\nframework. Theoretically, this perspective provides conditions for a specific\nform of intrinsic alignment. If the reward structures of the human-agent game\nmeet these conditions, we have a formal guarantee that the agent improving its\nown outcome will not harm the human's. Practically, this model motivates a\ntransparent control layer with predictable incentives where the agent learns to\ndefer when risky and act when safe, while its pretrained policy and the\nenvironment's reward structure remain untouched. Our gridworld simulation shows\nthat through independent learning, the agent and human discover their optimal\noversight roles. The agent learns to ask when uncertain and the human learns\nwhen to oversee, leading to an emergent collaboration that avoids safety\nviolations introduced post-training. This demonstrates a practical method for\nmaking misaligned models safer after deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \ud1b5\uc81c\ub97c

Current data selection methods are largely heuristic-based,\nlacking theoretical guarantees and generalizability. This work proposes a\ntheoretically-grounded approach using influence functions to estimate the\ncontribution of each data point to the learning objective. To overcome the\nprohibitive computational cost of policy rollouts required for online influence\nestimation, we introduce an off-policy influence estimation method that\nefficiently approximates data influence using pre-collected offline\ntrajectories. Furthermore, to manage the high-dimensional gradients of LLMs, we\nemploy sparse random projection to reduce dimensionality and improve storage\nand computation efficiency.

On a 1.5B model, it achieves a 2.66x step-level\nacceleration while using only 10\\% of the data per stage compared to\nfull-dataset training.

Among these methods, deep neural networks have been widely\nadopted due to their performance and accessibility, but they require large,\nhigh-quality datasets. Experimental data are often sparse, noisy, or\ninsufficient to build resilient data-driven models. Transfer learning, which\nleverages relevant data-abundant source domains to assist learning in\ndata-scarce target domains, has shown efficacy. Parameter transfer, where\npretrained weights are reused, is common but degrades under large domain\nshifts. Domain-adversarial neural networks (DANNs) help address this issue by\nlearning domain-invariant representations, thereby improving transfer under\ngreater domain shifts in a semi-supervised setting. However, DANNs can be\nunstable during training and lack a native means for uncertainty\nquantification. This study introduces a fully-supervised three-stage framework,\nthe staged Bayesian domain-adversarial neural network (staged B-DANN), that\ncombines parameter transfer and shared latent space adaptation. In Stage 1, a\ndeterministic feature extractor is trained on the source domain. This feature\nextractor is then adversarially refined using a DANN in Stage 2. In Stage 3, a\nBayesian neural network is built on the adapted feature extractor for\nfine-tuning on the target domain to handle conditional shifts and yield\ncalibrated uncertainty estimates. This staged B-DANN approach was first\nvalidated on a synthetic benchmark, where it was shown to significantly\noutperform standard transfer techniques. It was then applied to the task of\npredicting critical heat flux in rectangular channels, leveraging data from\ntube experiments as the source domain. The results of this study show that the\nstaged B-DANN method can improve predictive accuracy and generalization,\npotentially assisting other domains in nuclear engineering.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774

Accurate world models are essential for\nenabling agents to think, plan, and reason effectively in complex, dynamic\nsettings. Despite rapid progress, current world models remain brittle and\ndegrade over long horizons. We argue that a central cause is representation\nquality: exteroceptive inputs (e.g., images) are high-dimensional, and lossy or\nentangled latents make dynamics learning unnecessarily hard. We therefore ask\nwhether improving representation learning alone can substantially improve\nworld-model performance. In this work, we take a step toward building a truly\naccurate world model by addressing a fundamental yet open problem: constructing\na model that can fully clone and overfit to a deterministic 3D world. We\npropose Geometrically-Regularized World Models (GRWM), which enforces that\nconsecutive points along a natural sensory trajectory remain close in latent\nrepresentation space. This approach yields significantly improved latent\nrepresentations that align closely with the true topology of the environment.\nGRWM is plug-and-play, requires only minimal architectural modification, scales\nwith trajectory length, and is compatible with diverse latent generative\nbackbones. Across deterministic 3D settings and long-horizon prediction tasks,\nGRWM significantly increases rollout fidelity and stability. Analyses show that\nits benefits stem from learning a latent manifold with superior geometric\nstructure. These findings support a clear takeaway: improving representation\nlearning is a direct and useful path to robust world models, delivering\nreliable long-horizon predictions without enlarging the dynamics module.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub85c, \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\uaddc\ud654\ub41c \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0 \ub864\uc544\uc6c3\uc758 \ucda9\uc2e4\ub3c4\ub97c \ub192\uc778\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \ud658\uacbd\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294\ub370 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\uba70, \ud604\uc7ac \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc7a5\uae30 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\uaddc\ud654\ub41c \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378(GRWM)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc790\uc5f0 \uac10\uac01 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \ub530\ub77c \uc5f0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uc810\ub4e4\uc774 \uc7a0\uc7ac \ud45c\ud604 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \uac00\uae5d\ub3c4\ub85d \uac15\uc81c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "GRWM\uc740 3D \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ub864\uc544\uc6c3 \ucda9\uc2e4\ub3c4\uc640 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c \ub098\uc544\uac00\ub294 \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c \uacbd\ub85c\uc784\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc138\uc0c1\uc774 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ubc1c\uc804\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud558\ub294 \ub0b4\ubd80 \ubaa8\ub378\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacfc\uac70 \uad00\ucc30 \ubc0f \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c, \uadf8\uac83\uc740 \uad6c\ud604\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \ud658\uacbd\uc758 \ubbf8\ub798\ub97c \uc608\uce21\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud558\uace0 \ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uace0\ud558\uace0 \uacc4\ud68d\ud558\uba70 \ucd94\ub860\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae09\uc18d\ud55c \ubc1c\uc804\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\uba70 \uc774 \uc7a5\uae30\uc801 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0\uc11c degrade\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc911\uc559 \uc6d0\uc778\uc774 \ud45c\ud604 \ud488\uc9c8\uc774\ub77c\uace0 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uc678\ubd80 \uc785\ub825(\uc608: \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0)\uc740 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0\uc801\uc774\uba70, \uc190\uc2e4\uc774 \uc788\uac70\ub098 \uc5bd\ud78c \uc7a0\uc7ac \ubcc0\uc218\uac00 \ub3d9\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ubd88\ud544\uc694\ud558\uac8c \uc5b4\ub835\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4ed\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \uac83\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ubb3b\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uacb0\uc815\ub860\uc801\uc778 3D \uc138\uacc4\uc5d0 \uc644\uc804\ud788 \ubcf5\uc81c\ud558\uace0 \uacfc\uc801\ud569\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\ub294 \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc9c4\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud55c \uac78\uc74c\uc744 \ub0b4\ub51b\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc790\uc5f0 \uac10\uac01 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \ub530\ub77c \uc5f0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uc810\ub4e4\uc774 \uc7a0\uc7ac \ud45c\ud604 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \uac00\uae5d\uac8c \uc720\uc9c0\ub418\ub3c4\ub85d \uac15\uc81c\ud558\ub294 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\uaddc\ud654\ub41c \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378(GRWM)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ud658\uacbd\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc8fc\ud615\uacfc \ubc00\uc811\ud558\uac8c \uc815\ub82c\ub41c \uc7a0\uc7ac \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.
