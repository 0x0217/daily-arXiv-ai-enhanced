This capability has also been explored in Reinforcement Learning (RL), where agents interact with the environment to retrieve context and maximize cumulative rewards, showcasing strong adaptability in complex settings. However, in cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), where agents must coordinate toward a shared goal, decentralized policy deployment can lead to mismatches in task alignment and reward assignment, limiting the efficiency of policy adaptation. To address this challenge, we introduce Multi-agent In-context Coordination via Decentralized Memory Retrieval (MAICC), a novel approach designed to enhance coordination by fast adaptation. Our method involves training a centralized embedding model to capture fine-grained trajectory representations, followed by decentralized models that approximate the centralized one to obtain team-level task information. Based on the learned embeddings, relevant trajectories are retrieved as context, which, combined with the agents' current sub-trajectories, inform decision-making. During decentralized execution, we introduce a novel memory mechanism that effectively balances test-time online data with offline memory. Based on the constructed memory, we propose a hybrid utility score that incorporates both individual- and team-level returns, ensuring credit assignment across agents. Extensive experiments on cooperative MARL benchmarks, including Level-Based Foraging (LBF) and SMAC (v1/v2), show that MAICC enables faster adaptation to unseen tasks compared to existing methods.

While open-domain frameworks exist, applying them in private domains remains difficult due to heterogeneous tool formats, domain-specific jargon, restricted accessibility of APIs, and complex governance. Conventional solutions, such as fine-tuning on synthetic dialogue data, are burdensome and brittle under domain shifts, and risk degrading general performance. In this light, we introduce a framework for private-domain multi-agent conversational systems that avoids training and data generation by adopting behavior modeling and documentation. Our design simply assumes an orchestrator, a tool-calling agent, and a general chat agent, with tool integration defined through structured specifications and domain-informed instructions. This approach enables scalable adaptation to private tools and evolving contexts without continual retraining. The framework supports practical use cases, including lightweight deployment of multi-agent systems, leveraging API specifications as retrieval resources, and generating synthetic dialogue for evaluation -- providing a sustainable method for aligning agent behavior with domain expertise in private conversational ecosystems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758

Advances in large language models (LLMs) have established LLM-based agents as a major branch of MAS, enabling major breakthroughs in complex problem solving and world modeling. However, the reliability implications of this shift remain largely unexplored. i.e., whether substituting traditional agents with LLM-based agents can effectively enhance the reliability of MAS. In this work, we investigate and quantify the reliability of LLM-based agents from the perspective of Byzantine fault tolerance. We observe that LLM-based agents demonstrate stronger skepticism when processing erroneous message flows, a characteristic that enables them to outperform traditional agents across different topological structures. Motivated by the results of the pilot experiment, we design CP-WBFT, a confidence probe-based weighted Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus mechanism to enhance the stability of MAS with different topologies. It capitalizes on the intrinsic reflective and discriminative capabilities of LLMs by employing a probe-based, weighted information flow transmission method to improve the reliability of LLM-based agents. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CP-WBFT achieves superior performance across diverse network topologies under extreme Byzantine conditions (85.7\\% fault rate). Notably, our approach surpasses traditional methods by attaining remarkable accuracy on various topologies and maintaining strong reliability in both mathematical reasoning and safety assessment tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uace0 CP-WBFT\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud569\uc758 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc5ec \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud65c\uc6a9\uc774 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ube44\uc794\ud2f4 \uc7a5\uc560 \ud5c8\uc6a9 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\uace0 CP-WBFT\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \ud5a5\uc0c1 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "CP-WBFT\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ud1a0\ud3f4\ub85c\uc9c0\uc5d0\uc11c \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \ud2b9\ud788 \ube44\uc794\ud2f4 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c \ub192\uc740 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ub9ac\uc778 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uace0 \uc2e4\ud328\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud560 \ub54c \ubb38\uc81c\uc758 \ub300\ub9ac\uc778\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(MAS)\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uacfc\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc73c\ub85c LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ub300\ub9ac\uc778\uc774 MAS\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \ubd84\uc57c\ub85c \uc790\ub9ac \uc7a1\uc544 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0\uacfc \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc5d0\uc11c \ud070 \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubcc0\ud654\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \ud568\uc758\ub294 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84 \ud0d0\uad6c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc989, \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ub300\ub9ac\uc778\uc744 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ub300\ub9ac\uc778\uc73c\ub85c \ub300\uccb4\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 MAS\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0 \uc5ec\ubd80\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ube44\uc794\ud2f4 \uc7a5\uc560 \ud5c8\uc6a9 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ub300\ub9ac\uc778\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uace0 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

To ensure individual-global-max (IGM) consistency, existing methods either enforce monotonicity constraints, which limit expressive power, or adopt softer surrogates at the cost of algorithmic complexity. In this work, we present a dynamical systems analysis of non-monotonic value decomposition, modeling learning dynamics as continuous-time gradient flow. We prove that, under approximately greedy exploration, all zero-loss equilibria violating IGM consistency are unstable saddle points, while only IGM-consistent solutions are stable attractors of the learning dynamics. Extensive experiments on both synthetic matrix games and challenging MARL benchmarks demonstrate that unconstrained, non-monotonic factorization reliably recovers IGM-optimal solutions and consistently outperforms monotonic baselines. Additionally, we investigate the influence of temporal-difference targets and exploration strategies, providing actionable insights for the design of future value-based MARL algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ube44\ubaa8\ub178\ud1a0\ub2c9 \uac00\uce58 \ubd84\ud574\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub3d9\uc801 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0, IGM \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ubc18\ud558\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc81c\ub85c \uc190\uc2e4 \ud3c9\ud615\uc774 \ubd88\uc548\uc815\ud55c \uc548\uc7a5\uc810\uc784\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \uac1c\ubcc4-\uae00\ub85c\ubc8c-\ucd5c\ub300(IGM) \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud559\uc2b5 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uc5f0\uc18d \uc2dc\uac04 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \ud750\ub984\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uace0 \ube44\ubaa8\ub178\ud1a0\ub2c9 \uac00\uce58 \ubd84\ud574\uc758 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ube44\uc81c\ud55c\uc801 \ube44\ubaa8\ub178\ud1a0\ub2c9 \ubd84\ud574\uac00 IGM \ucd5c\uc801 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf5\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \ubaa8\ub178\ud1a0\ub2c9 \uae30\uc900\uc120\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubbf8\ub798 \uac00\uce58 \uae30\ubc18 MARL \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac00\uce58 \ubd84\ud574\ub294 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uac00\uce58 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \ub85c\uceec \uac12\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\uc5ec \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uc911\uc2dd \ud6c8\ub828\uacfc \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc2e4\ud589\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(MARL)\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc774\ub2e4. \uac1c\ubcc4-\uae00\ub85c\ubc8c-\ucd5c\ub300(IGM) \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ud45c\ud604\ub825\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \ub2e8\uc870\uc131 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \uac15\uc694\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc758 \ub300\uac00\ub97c \uce58\ub974\uba70 \ub354 \ubd80\ub4dc\ub7ec\uc6b4 \ub300\uccb4\ubb3c\uc744 \ucc44\ud0dd\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ube44\ubaa8\ub178\ud1a0\ub2c9 \uac00\uce58 \ubd84\ud574\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub3d9\uc801 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \ud559\uc2b5 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uc5f0\uc18d \uc2dc\uac04 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \ud750\ub984\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac70\uc758 \ud0d0\uc695\uc801\uc778 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c IGM \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ubc18\ud558\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc81c\ub85c \uc190\uc2e4 \ud3c9\ud615\uc774 \ubd88\uc548\uc815\ud55c \uc548\uc7a5\uc810\uc784\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud558\uace0, \uc624\uc9c1 IGM \uc77c\uad00 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\ub9cc\uc774 \ud559\uc2b5 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc758 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \ub04c\uc5b4\ub2f9\uae40\uc810\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \ud569\uc131 \ud589\ub82c \uac8c\uc784\uacfc \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc778 MARL \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc740 \uc81c\ud55c \uc5c6\ub294 \ube44\ubaa8\ub178\ud1a0\ub2c9 \ubd84\ud574\uac00 IGM \ucd5c\uc801 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud68c\ubcf5\ud558\uace0 \ub2e8\uc870\uc131 \uae30\uc900\uc120\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc2dc\uac04 \ucc28\uc774 \ubaa9\ud45c \ubc0f \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uc804\ub7b5\uc758 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uc5ec \ubbf8\ub798 \uac00\uce58 \uae30\ubc18 MARL \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

Nonetheless, equivariant methods are often not employed, perhaps because training is perceived to be challenging, or the symmetry is expected to be learned, or equivariant implementations are seen as hard to build. Group averaging is an available technique for these situations. It happens at test time; it can make any trained model precisely equivariant at a (often small) cost proportional to the size of the group; it places no requirements on model structure or training. It is known that, under mild conditions, the group-averaged model will have a provably better prediction accuracy than the original model. Here we show that an inexpensive group averaging can improve accuracy in practice. We take well-established benchmark machine learning models of differential equations in which certain symmetries ought to be obeyed. At evaluation time, we average the models over a small group of symmetries. Our experiments show that this procedure always decreases the average evaluation loss, with improvements of up to 37\\% in terms of the VRMSE. The averaging produces visually better predictions for continuous dynamics. This short paper shows that, under certain common circumstances, there are no disadvantages to imposing exact symmetries; the ML4PS community should consider group averaging as a cheap and simple way to improve model accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uadf8\ub8f9 \ud3c9\uade0\ud654 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc790\uc5f0 \uacfc\ud559\uc758 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc791\uc5c5\ub4e4\uc740 \ud2b9\uc815 \ub300\uce6d\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \ub4f1\ubcc0\uc131\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ub300\uce6d\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uc120\uc785\uacac\uc774\ub098 \uad6c\ud604\uc758 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \ub4f1\ubcc0\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc774 \uc885\uc885 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc874\uc7ac\ud558\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uc744 \uc18c\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub300\uce6d \uc9d1\ud569\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud3c9\uade0\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uadf8\ub8f9 \ud3c9\uade0\ud654 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc740 \ud56d\uc0c1 \ud3c9\uade0 \ud3c9\uac00 \uc190\uc2e4\uc744 \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba70 VRMSE \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ub300 37\tilde{0}\text{{}%} \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc815\ud655\ud55c \ub300\uce6d\uc744 \uac15\uc694\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ub2e8\uc810\uc774 \uc5c6\uc73c\uba70, ML4PS \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ud2f0\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc800\ub834\ud558\uace0 \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c \uadf8\ub8f9 \ud3c9\uade0\ud654\ub97c \uace0\ub824\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc790\uc5f0 \uacfc\ud559\uc758 \ub9ce\uc740 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc791\uc5c5\ub4e4\uc740 \ud2b9\uc815 \ub300\uce6d\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \ub4f1\ubcc0\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7fc\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \ud6c8\ub828\uc774 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc778\uc2dd\uc774\ub098 \ub300\uce6d\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \uae30\ub300\ub418\uba70, \ub4f1\ubcc0\uc801 \uad6c\ud604\uc774 \uc5b4\ub835\ub2e4\uace0 \uc5ec\uaca8\uc9c0\ub294 \uc774\uc720\ub85c \ub300\uce6d \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc885\uc885 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub8f9 \ud3c9\uade0\ud654\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uae30\uc220\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774 \uae30\ubc95\uc740 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc5d0 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uba70, \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc18c\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub300\uce6d\uc758 \uc9d1\ud569\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \ub4f1\ubcc0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub9cc\ub4e4 \uc218 \uc788\uace0, \uadf8\ub8f9 \ud06c\uae30\uc5d0 \ube44\ub840\ud55c \uc791\uc740 \ube44\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc9c4\ub2e4. \ubaa8\ub378 \uad6c\uc870\ub098 \ud6c8\ub828\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc694\uad6c\uc0ac\ud56d\uc774 \uc5c6\ub2e4. \uc628\uac74\ud55c \uc870\uac74\ud558\uc5d0 \uadf8\ub8f9 \ud3c9\uade0\ud654 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc6d0\ub798 \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uac00 \uc99d\uba85\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \uc801\uc740 \uadf8\ub8f9 \ud3c9\uade0\ud654\uac00 \uc2e4\uc81c\ub85c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \ud2b9\uc815 \ub300\uce6d\uc744 \uc900\uc218\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294 \ubbf8\ubd84 \ubc29\uc815\uc2dd\uc758 \uc798 \ud655\ub9bd\ub41c \uae30\uc900 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud3c9\uac00 \uc2dc\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc18c\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub300\uce6d \uadf8\ub8f9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud3c9\uade0\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc740 \uc774 \uc808\ucc28\uac00 \ud56d\uc0c1 \ud3c9\uade0 \ud3c9\uac00 \uc190\uc2e4\uc744 \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, VRMSE \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ub300 37\text{{}%}\uc758 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4. \ud3c9\uade0\ud654\ub294 \uc5f0\uc18d \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2dc\uac01\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc9e7\uc740 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ub300\uce6d\uc744 \uac15\uc694\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub2e8\uc810\uc774 \uc5c6\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.

Advancing such agents requires reproducible evaluation and large-scale training in controllable, diverse, and realistic tool-use environments. However, real-world APIs are limited in availability, domain coverage, and stability, often requiring access keys and imposing rate limits, which render them impractical for stable evaluation or scalable training. To address these challenges, we introduce SynthTools, a flexible and scalable framework for generating synthetic tool ecosystems. Our framework consists of three core components: Tool Generation for automatic and scalable creation of diverse tools, Tool Simulation to emulate realistic tool behaviors, and Tool Audit to ensure correctness and consistency of tool simulation. To illustrate its scalability, we show that SynthTools can readily produce toolsets that span twice as many domains and twice as many tools per domain as prior work. Furthermore, the tool simulation and tool audit components demonstrate strong reliability, achieving $94\\%$ and $99\\%$ accuracy respectively. Finally, we construct downstream tasks from the generated tools that even state-of-the-art models struggle to complete. By enabling scalable, diverse, and reliable tool ecosystems, SynthTools provides a practical path toward large-scale training and stable evaluation of tool-use agents.

However, this surge raises significant privacy concerns, as sensitive patterns can reveal personal details. While traditional differential privacy (DP) relies on trusted servers, local differential privacy (LDP) enables users to perturb their own data. However, traditional LDP methods perturb time series data by adding user-specific noise but exhibit vulnerabilities. For instance, noise applied within fixed time windows can be canceled during aggregation (e.g., averaging), enabling adversaries to infer individual statistics over time, thereby eroding privacy guarantees.\n  To address these issues, we introduce a Cooperative Local Differential Privacy (CLDP) mechanism that enhances privacy by distributing noise vectors across multiple users. In our approach, noise is collaboratively generated and assigned so that when all users' perturbed data is aggregated, the noise cancels out preserving overall statistical properties while protecting individual privacy. This cooperative strategy not only counters vulnerabilities inherent in time-window-based methods but also scales effectively for large, real-time datasets, striking a better balance between data

Such approaches risk recommending insensitive or unsafe interventions, especially in domains involving serious mental illness, substance use disorders, or depression. To address this limitation, we propose a Responsible Reinforcement Learning (RRL) framework that integrates emotional and contextual understanding with ethical considerations into the sequential decision-making process. RRL formulates personalization as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP), where the agent optimizes engagement and adherence while ensuring emotional alignment and ethical safety. We introduce a multi-objective reward function that explicitly balances short-term behavioral engagement with long-term user well-being, and define an emotion-informed state representation that captures fluctuations in emotional readiness, affect, and risk. The proposed architecture can be instantiated with any RL algorithm (e.g., DQN, PPO) augmented with safety constraints or Lagrangian regularization. Conceptually, this framework operationalizes empathy and responsibility within machine learning policy optimization, bridging safe RL, affective computing and responsible AI. We discuss the implications of this approach for human-centric domains such as behavioral health, education, and digital therapeutics, and outline simulation-based validation paths for future empirical work. This paper aims to initiate a methodological conversation about ethically aligned reinforcement learning for emotionally aware and trustworthy personalization systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc815\uc11c\uc801 \ubc0f \uc724\ub9ac\uc801 \uace0\ub824\uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \ucc45\uc784 \uc788\ub294 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RRL) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c \uc758\ub8cc \ubc0f \ud589\ub3d9 \uc9c0\uc6d0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c \uacb0\uc815 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc758 \uc815\uc11c\uc801 \ub9e5\ub77d\uacfc \uc724\ub9ac\uc801 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ubb34\uc2dc\ud558\uace0 static \uaddc\uce59 \uae30\ubc18 \ub610\ub294 \ucc38\uc5ec \uadf9\ub300\ud654 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \ubbfc\uac10\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uac70\ub098 \uc548\uc804\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uac1c\uc785\uc744 \ucd94\ucc9c\ud560 \uc704\ud5d8\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\ucc45\uc784 \uc788\ub294 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RRL) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc815\uc11c\uc801 \ubc0f \ub9e5\ub77d\uc801 \uc774\ud574\uc640 \uc724\ub9ac\uc801 \uace0\ub824\uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \uc5f0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uba70, \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub97c \uc81c\uc57d\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815(CMDP)\uc73c\ub85c \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "RRL\uc740 \ud589\ub3d9 engagement\uc640 adherence\ub97c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uac10\uc815\uc801 \uc77c\uce58 \ubc0f \uc724\ub9ac\uc801 \uc548\uc804\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\ubaa9\uc801 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc815\ucc45 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc5d0\uc11c \uacf5\uac10\uacfc \ucc45\uc784\uc744 \uad6c\ud604\ud558\uba70, \ud589\ub3d9 \uac74\uac15, \uad50\uc721 \ubc0f \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uce58\ub8cc\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc778\uac04 \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2dc\uc0ac\uc810\uc744 \ub17c\uc758\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc758\ub8cc \ubc0f \ud589\ub3d9 \uc9c0\uc6d0\uc5d0\uc11c \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c \uacb0\uc815 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc758 \uc815\uc11c\uc801 \ub9e5\ub77d\uacfc \uc724\ub9ac\uc801 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \uac04\uacfc\ud558\ub294 \uc815\uc801 \uaddc\uce59 \uae30\ubc18 \ub610\ub294 \ucc38\uc5ec \uadf9\ub300\ud654 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \ud2b9\ud788 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \uc815\uc2e0 \uc9c8\ud658, \uc57d\ubb3c \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uc7a5\uc560 \ub610\ub294 \uc6b0\uc6b8\uc99d\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ub41c \uc601\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c \uac10\uc815\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub454\uac10\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc548\uc804\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uac1c\uc785\uc744 \ucd94\ucc9c\ud560 \uc704\ud5d8\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc815\uc11c\uc801 \ubc0f \ub9e5\ub77d\uc801 \uc774\ud574\ub97c \uc724\ub9ac\uc801 \uace0\ub824\uc0ac\ud56d\uacfc \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc5f0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ucc45\uc784 \uc788\ub294 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RRL) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

However, to further cultivate capabilities such as adaptive behavior and long-term decision-making, training on static datasets built from human-level knowledge is insufficient. These datasets are costly to construct and lack both dynamism and realism. A growing consensus is that agents should instead interact directly with environments and learn from experience through reinforcement learning. We formalize this iterative process as the Generation-Execution-Feedback (GEF) loop, where environments generate tasks to challenge agents, return observations in response to agents' actions during task execution, and provide evaluative feedback on rollouts for subsequent learning. Under this paradigm, environments function as indispensable producers of experiential data, highlighting the need to scale them toward greater complexity, realism, and interactivity. In this survey, we systematically review representative methods for environment scaling from a pioneering environment-centric perspective and organize them along the stages of the GEF loop, namely task generation, task execution, and feedback. We further analyze benchmarks, implementation strategies, and applications, consolidating fragmented advances and outlining future research directions for agent intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774

Unlike human-agent interactions, where humans ground and steer conversations, AxA lacks such stabilizing signals, making these failures unique. We investigate one such failure, echoing, where agents abandon their assigned roles and instead mirror their conversational partners, undermining their intended objectives. Through experiments across $60$ AxA configurations, $3$ domains, and $2000+$ conversations, we demonstrate that echoing occurs across three major LLM providers, with echoing rates from $5\\%$ to $70\\%$ depending on the model and domain. Moreover, we find that echoing is persistent even in advanced reasoning models with substantial rates ($32.8\\%$) that are not reduced by increased reasoning efforts. We analyze prompt impacts, conversation dynamics, showing that echoing arises as interaction grows longer ($7+$ turns in experiments) and is not merely an artifact of sub-optimal prompting. Finally, we introduce a protocol-level mitigation in which targeted use of structured responses reduces echoing to $9\\%$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc720\ud615\uc758 \uc2e4\ud328, \uc989 \ub300\ud654 \uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04 \uac70\uc6b8 \ubc18\uc751\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud568\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc778\uc9c0\uc801 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uc800\ud574\ud558\uba70, \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774 \ud604\uc0c1\uc774 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud558\uac8c \uc874\uc7ac\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc774 \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc11c\ub85c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud560 \ub54c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc720\ud615\uc758 \uc2e4\ud328\ub97c \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "60\uac1c AxA \uad6c\uc131, 3\uac1c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ubc0f 2000\ud68c \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \ub300\ud654\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04 \uac70\uc6b8 \ubc18\uc751\uc778 echoing \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc5ec\ub7ec \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc81c\uacf5\uc790\uc5d0\uc11c echoing\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uba70 \ube44\uc728\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378 \ubc0f \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c 5%\uc5d0\uc11c 70%\uae4c\uc9c0 \ub2e4\uc591\ud558\ub2e4. \uace0\uae09 \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 echoing\uc774 \uc9c0\uc18d\ub418\uba70 \ube44\uc728\uc740 32.8%\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc751\ub2f5\uc758 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc9c0\ud5a5\uc801 \ud65c\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 echoing\uc744 9%\ub85c \uc904\uc774\ub294 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc644\ud654 \ubc29\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc774 \uc11c\ub85c \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \uc608\uce21\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc720\ud615\uc758 \uc2e4\ud328\uac00 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0a9\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04 \ub300\ud654\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9 \ud3b8\ucc28(AxA)\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc778\uac04-\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uacfc \ub2ec\ub9ac, \uc778\uac04\uc774 \ub300\ud654\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uace0 \uc870\uc885\ud558\ub294 \ubc18\uba74, AxA\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc548\uc815\ud654 \uc2e0\ud638\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc2e4\ud328\uac00 \ub3c5\ud2b9\ud558\uac8c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ud560\ub2f9\ub41c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud3ec\uae30\ud558\uace0 \ub300\ud654 \uc0c1\ub300\ub97c \ubc18\uc0ac\ud558\ub294 echoing\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ud55c \uac00\uc9c0 \uc2e4\ud328\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. $60$\uac1c\uc758 AxA \uad6c\uc131, $3$\uac1c\uc758 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ubc0f $2000+$\ud68c\uc758 \ub300\ud654\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574, echoing\uc774 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 LLM \uc81c\uacf5\uc790 \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uba70 \ubaa8\ub378 \ubc0f \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c echoing \ube44\uc728\uc774 $5\text{%}$\uc5d0\uc11c $70\text{%}$\uae4c\uc9c0 \ub2e4\uc591\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 echoing\uc774 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ube44\uc728($32.8\text{%}$)\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \uace0\uae09 \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c\uc870\ucc28 \uc9c0\uc18d\ub418\uba70, \uc99d\uac00\ub41c \ucd94\ub860 \ub178\ub825\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \uc904\uc5b4\ub4e4\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c \ub300\ud654\uac00 \uae38\uc5b4\uc9c8\uc218\ub85d($7+$\ud134) echoing\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \ube44\ucd5c\uc801 \uc720\ub3c4 \uc2e0\ud638\uc758 \uc0b0\ubb3c\uc774 \uc544\ub2d8\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\ub294 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc601\ud5a5 \ubc0f \ub300\ud654 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c, \ubaa9\ud45c \uc9c0\ud5a5\uc801 \uad6c\uc870\ud654 \uc751\ub2f5\uc758 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 echoing\uc744 $9\text{%}$\ub85c \uc904\uc774\ub294 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc644\ud654 \ubc29\uc548\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Although DD is often assumed to enhance data privacy by aggregating over individual examples, recent studies reveal that standard DD can still leak sensitive information from the original dataset due to the lack of formal privacy guarantees. Existing differentially private (DP)-DD methods attempt to mitigate this risk by injecting noise into the distillation process. However, they often fail to fully leverage the original dataset, resulting in degraded realism and utility. This paper introduces \\libn, a novel framework that addresses the key limitations of current DP-DD by leveraging DP-generated data. Specifically, \\lib initializes the distilled dataset with DP-generated data to enhance realism. Then, generated data refines the DP-feature matching technique to distill the original dataset under a small privacy budget, and trains an expert model to align the distilled examples with their class distribution.

This gives rise to parametric expensive multi-objective optimization problems (P-EMOPs) where each task parameter defines a distinct optimization instance. Current multi-objective Bayesian optimization methods have been widely used for finding finite sets of Pareto optimal solutions for individual tasks. However, P-EMOPs present a fundamental challenge: the continuous task parameter space can contain infinite distinct problems, each requiring separate expensive evaluations. This demands learning an inverse model that can directly predict optimized solutions for any task-preference query without expensive re-evaluation. This paper introduces the first parametric multi-objective Bayesian optimizer that learns this inverse model by alternating between (1) acquisition-driven search leveraging inter-task synergies and (2) generative solution sampling via conditional generative models. This approach enables efficient optimization across related tasks and finally achieves direct solution prediction for unseen parameterized EMOPs without additional expensive evaluations. We theoretically justify the faster convergence by leveraging inter-task synergies through task-aware Gaussian processes. Meanwhile, empirical studies in synthetic and real-world benchmarks further verify the effectiveness of our alternating framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4dc\ub294 \ub2e4\ubaa9\uc801 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c(P-EMOPs)\uc758 \ud30c\ub77c\uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad \ub2e4\ubaa9\uc801 \ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc6b4\uc601 \uc870\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c \ube44\uc2fc \ub2e4\ubaa9\uc801 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\uc758 \ud574\uacb0\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc0c1\ud638 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc2dc\ub108\uc9c0\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \ud0d0\uc0c9\uacfc \uc870\uac74\ubd80 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \ud574\uacb0\ucc45 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5ed \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \ud30c\ub77c\uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad \ub2e4\ubaa9\uc801 \ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0, \ucd94\uac00\uc801\uc778 \ube44\uc2fc \ud3c9\uac00 \uc5c6\uc774 \ubcf4\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c \ud30c\ub77c\uba54\ud130\ud654\ub41c EMOPs\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc778 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\uc5c5 \uc778\uc2dd \uac00\uc6b0\uc2dc\uc548 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub354 \ube60\ub978 \uc218\ub834\uc744 \uc815\ub2f9\ud654\ud558\uba70, \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud588\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub9ce\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc6b4\uc601 \uc870\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c \ube44\uc2fc \ub2e4\ubaa9\uc801 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c(EMOPs)\uc758 \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud574\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uac01 \uc791\uc5c5 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\uac00 \ubcc4\uac1c\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4\ub97c \uc815\uc758\ud558\ub294 \ud30c\ub77c\uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad \ube44\uc2fc \ub2e4\ubaa9\uc801 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c(P-EMOPs)\ub97c \ubc1c\uc0dd\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ub2e4\ubaa9\uc801 \ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uac1c\ubcc4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc720\ud55c\ud55c \ud30c\ub808\ud1a0 \ucd5c\uc801 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158 \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \ucc3e\ub294 \ub370 \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 P-EMOPs\ub294 \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uc804\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uc5f0\uc18d \uc791\uc5c5 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \uacf5\uac04\uc740 \uac01\uae30 \ub2e4\ub978 \ube44\uc2fc \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc694\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \ubb34\ud55c\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc120\ud638 \ucffc\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ube44\uc2fc \uc7ac\ud3c9\uac00 \uc5c6\uc774 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub41c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc9c1\uc811 \uc608\uce21\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc5ed \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud574\uc57c \ud568\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 (1) \uc791\uc5c5 \uac04 \uc2dc\ub108\uc9c0\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \ud0d0\uc0c9\uacfc (2) \uc870\uac74\ubd80 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \uc0dd\uc131\uc801 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uc744 \ubc88\uac08\uc544\uac00\uba70 \uc774 \uc5ed \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \ud30c\ub77c\uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad \ub2e4\ubaa9\uc801 \ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uae30\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uad00\ub828 \uc791\uc5c5 \uac04\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uba70, \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\uac00\uc801\uc778 \ube44\uc2fc \ud3c9\uac00 \uc5c6\uc774 \ubcf4\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c \ud30c\ub77c\uba54\ud130\ud654\ub41c EMOPs\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc778 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc2e4\ud604\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc778\uc2dd \uac00\uc6b0\uc2dc\uc548 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc791\uc5c5 \uac04 \uc2dc\ub108\uc9c0\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub354 \ube60\ub978 \uc218\ub834\uc744 \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\ub2f9\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud55c\ud3b8, \ud569\uc131 \ubc0f \uc2e4\uc81c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\uc99d \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uad50\ub300 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \ub354\uc6b1 \uac80\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, generating effective presentation slides introduces unique challenges due to the complexity of multimodal content creation and the need for precise, domain-specific information. Existing LLM-based solutions often fail to produce reliable and informative outputs, limiting their educational value. To address these limitations, we introduce SlideBot - a modular, multi-agent slide generation framework that integrates LLMs with retrieval, structured planning, and code generation. SlideBot is organized around three pillars: informativeness, ensuring deep and contextually grounded content; reliability, achieved by incorporating external sources through retrieval; and practicality, which enables customization and iterative feedback through instructor collaboration. It incorporates evidence-based instructional design principles from Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) and the Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (CTML), using structured planning to manage intrinsic load and consistent visual macros to reduce extraneous load and enhance dual-channel learning.

It stands out as one of the few industrial protocols that provide robust security features designed to prevent attackers from manipulating and damaging critical infrastructures. However, prior works showed that significant challenges still exists to set up secure OPC UA deployments in practice, mainly caused by the complexity of certificate management in industrial scenarios and the inconsistent implementation of security features across industrial OPC UA devices. In this paper, we present Pk-IOTA, an automated solution designed to secure OPC UA communications by integrating programmable data plane switches for in-network certificate validation and leveraging the IOTA Tangle for decen- tralized certificate distribution. Our evaluation is performed on a physical testbed representing a real-world industrial scenario and shows that Pk-IOTA introduces a minimal overhead while providing a scalable and tamper-proof mechanism for OPC UA certificate management.", "AI": {"tldr": "OPC UA \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc740 \uc0b0\uc5c5 4.0\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uacc4 \uac04 \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc744 \uc704\ud55c

We propose SEBA, a sample-efficient framework for black-box adversarial attacks on visual RL agents. SEBA integrates a shadow Q model that estimates cumulative rewards under adversarial conditions, a generative adversarial network that produces visually imperceptible perturbations, and a world model that simulates environment dynamics to reduce real-world queries. Through a two-stage iterative training procedure that alternates between learning the shadow model and refining the generator, SEBA achieves strong attack performance while maintaining efficiency. Experiments on MuJoCo and Atari benchmarks show that SEBA significantly reduces cumulative rewards, preserves visual fidelity, and greatly decreases environment interactions compared to prior black-box and white-box methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "SEBA\ub294 \ube44\uc8fc\uc5bc RL \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 \uacf5\uaca9 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uacf5\uaca9 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud655\ubcf4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ube44\uc8fc\uc5bc \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uad50\ub780\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc774 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \ud0d0\uad6c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uace0, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uacf5\uaca9 \ubc29\uc2dd\ub4e4\uc740 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uae30\ubc18 \uc5f0\uc18d \uc81c\uc5b4\uc758 \ud070 \ud589\ub3d9 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "SEBA\ub294 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc870\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c \ub204\uc801 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \ucd94\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uadf8\ub9bc\uc790 Q \ubaa8\ub378, \uc2dc\uac01\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\uc2dd\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \uad50\ub780\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc0dd\uc131\uc801 \uc801\ub300 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uc2e4\uc81c \ucffc\ub9ac\ub97c \uc904\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud658\uacbd \uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud558\ub294 \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "SEBA\ub294 MuJoCo\uc640 Atari \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub204\uc801 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0, \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \ucda9\uc2e4\ub3c4\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba70, \uc774\uc804\uc758 \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 \ubc0f \ud654\uc774\ud2b8\ubc15\uc2a4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ud658\uacbd \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uc904\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "SEBA\ub294 \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ube44\uc8fc\uc5bc \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \ube44\uc8fc\uc5bc \uc81c\uc5b4\uc640 \ub85c\ubd07 \uacf5\ud559\uc5d0\uc11c \uad04\ubaa9\ud560 \ub9cc\ud55c \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uad50\ub780\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc740 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \ud0d0\uad6c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \uae30\uc874 \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 \uacf5\uaca9\uc740 \ubca1\ud130 \uae30\ubc18 \ub610\ub294 \uc774\uc0b0 \ud589\ub3d9 RL\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uae30\ubc18 \uc5f0\uc18d \uc81c\uc5b4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud6a8\uacfc\ub294 \ud070 \ud589\ub3d9 \uacf5\uac04\uacfc \uacfc\ub3c4\ud55c \ud658\uacbd \ucffc\ub9ac\ub85c \uc81c\ud55c\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ube44\uc8fc\uc5bc RL \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c SEBA\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Accepted at NeurIPS 2025", "summary": "AI systems are increasingly able to autonomously conduct realistic software engineering tasks, and may soon be deployed to automate machine learning (ML) R&D itself. Frontier AI systems may be deployed in safety-critical settings, including to help ensure the safety of future systems. Unfortunately, frontier and future systems may not be sufficiently trustworthy, and there is evidence that these systems may even be misaligned with their developers or users. Therefore, we investigate the capabilities of AI agents to act against the interests of their users when conducting ML engineering, by sabotaging ML models, sandbagging their performance, and subverting oversight mechanisms. First, we extend MLE-Bench, a benchmark for realistic ML tasks, with code-sabotage tasks such as implanting backdoors and purposefully causing generalisation failures. Frontier agents make meaningful progress on our sabotage tasks. In addition, we study agent capabilities to sandbag on MLE-Bench. Agents can calibrate their performance to specified target levels below their actual capability. To mitigate sabotage, we use LM monitors to detect suspicious agent behaviour, and we measure model capability to sabotage and sandbag without being detected by these monitors. Overall, monitors are capable at detecting code-sabotage attempts but our results suggest that detecting sandbagging is more difficult. Additionally, aggregating multiple monitor predictions works well, but monitoring may not be sufficiently reliable to mitigate sabotage in high-stakes domains.

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong performance in this setting. However, traditional statically-provisioned GNN inference architectures fall short in meeting two crucial demands of intrusion detection: (1) maintaining consistently low detection latency, and (2) handling highly irregular and bursty workloads. To holistically address these challenges, we present GraphFaaS, a serverless architecture tailored for GNN-based intrusion detection. GraphFaaS leverages the elasticity and agility of serverless computing to dynamically scale the GNN inference pipeline. We parallelize and adapt GNN workflows to a serverless environment, ensuring that the system can respond in real time to fluctuating workloads. By decoupling compute resources from static provisioning, GraphFaaS delivers stable inference latency, which is critical for dependable intrusion detection and timely incident response in cybersecurity operations. Preliminary evaluation shows GraphFaaS reduces average detection latency by 85% and coefficient of variation (CV) by 64% compared to the baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "GraphFaaS\ub294 GNN \uae30\ubc18 \uce68\uc785 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc11c\ubc84\ub9ac\uc2a4 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub85c, \uc720\uc5f0\ud55c \ub9ac\uc18c\uc2a4 \uad00\ub9ac\ub85c \ub0ae\uc740 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uce68\uc785 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uc758 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc740 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \ub0ae\uc740 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc720\uc9c0\uc640 \ub192\uc740 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \uc791\uc5c5 \ubd80\ud558 \ucc98\ub9ac\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "GraphFaaS\ub294 \uc11c\ubc84\ub9ac\uc2a4 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305\uc758 \uc720\uc5f0\uc131\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec GNN \ucd94\ub860 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uace0, GNN \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub97c \uc11c\ubc84\ub9ac\uc2a4 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \ubcd1\ub82c\ud654 \ubc0f \uc801\uc751\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "result": "GraphFaaS\ub294 \ud3c9\uade0 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 85% \uc904\uc774\uace0 \ubcc0\ub3d9 \uacc4\uc218(CV)\ub97c 64% \ub0ae\ucd98\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "GraphFaaS\ub294 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uce68\uc785 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uc640 \uc2dc\uae30\uc801\uc808\ud55c \uc0ac\uac74 \ub300\uc751\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \ucd94\ub860 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uae30\ubc18 \uae30\ub85d(Provinece) \uae30\ubc18 \uce68\uc785 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ud65c\ub3d9\uc744 \uae30\ubc18 \uae30\ub85d \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uc5ec \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc545\uc758\uc801\uc778 \ud589\ub3d9 \uac04\uc758 \uc778\uacfc \uad00\uacc4 \ubc0f \uc0c1\uad00 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548\uc5d0\uc11c \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uc778\uae30 \uc788\ub294 \uadf8\ub798\ud53d \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc751\uc6a9 \ubd84\uc57c\uc774\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(GNN)\uc740 \uc774 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc815\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uacf5\ub41c GNN \ucd94\ub860 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub294 \uce68\uc785 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uc758 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \ucda9\uc871\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4: (1) \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ub0ae\uc740 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc720\uc9c0, (2) \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ubd88\uaddc\uce59\ud558\uace0 \ud3ed\ubc1c\uc801\uc778 \uc791\uc5c5 \ubd80\ud558 \ucc98\ub9ac. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uc804\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 GNN \uae30\ubc18 \uce68\uc785 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \ub9de\ucda4\ud654\ub41c \uc11c\ubc84\ub9ac\uc2a4 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc778 GraphFaaS\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.

In this work, we focus on contextual reinforcement learning, where agents act within environments with varying contexts, such as self-driving cars or quadrupedal robots that need to operate in different terrains or weather conditions than they were trained for. We tackle the critical task of generalizing to out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, without access to explicit context information at test time. Recent work has addressed this problem by training a context encoder and a history adaptation module in separate stages. While promising, this two-phase approach is cumbersome to implement and train. We simplify the methodology and introduce SPARC: single-phase adaptation for robust control.

Version with Appendix", "summary": "We introduce SPAN, a cross-calendar temporal reasoning benchmark, which requires LLMs to perform intra-calendar temporal reasoning and inter-calendar temporal conversion. SPAN features ten cross-calendar temporal reasoning directions, two reasoning types, and two question formats across six calendars. To enable time-variant and contamination-free evaluation, we propose a template-driven protocol for dynamic instance generation that enables assessment on a user-specified Gregorian date. We conduct extensive experiments on both open- and closed-source state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs over a range of dates spanning 100 years from 1960 to 2060. Our evaluations show that these LLMs achieve an average accuracy of only 34.5%, with none exceeding 80%, indicating that this task remains challenging. Through in-depth analysis of reasoning types, question formats, and temporal reasoning directions, we identify two key obstacles for LLMs: Future-Date Degradation and Calendar Asymmetry Bias. To strengthen LLMs' cross-calendar temporal reasoning capability, we further develop an LLM-powered Time Agent that leverages tool-augmented code generation. Empirical results show that Time Agent achieves an average accuracy of 95.31%, outperforming several competitive baselines, highlighting the potential of tool-augmented code generation to advance cross-calendar temporal reasoning.

We propose NeuroLingua, a language-inspired framework that conceptualizes sleep as a structured physiological language. Each 30-second epoch is decomposed into overlapping 3-second subwindows (\"tokens\") using a CNN-based tokenizer, enabling hierarchical temporal modeling through dual-level Transformers: intra-segment encoding of local dependencies and inter-segment integration across seven consecutive epochs (3.5 minutes) for extended context. Modality-specific embeddings from EEG and EOG channels are fused via a Graph Convolutional Network, facilitating robust multimodal integration. NeuroLingua is evaluated on the Sleep-EDF Expanded and ISRUC-Sleep datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results on Sleep-EDF (85.3% accuracy, 0.800 macro F1, and 0.796 Cohen's kappa) and competitive performance on ISRUC (81.9% accuracy, 0.802 macro F1, and 0.755 kappa), matching or exceeding published baselines in overall and per-class metrics. The architecture's attention mechanisms enhance the detection of clinically relevant sleep microevents, providing a principled foundation for future interpretability, explainability, and causal inference in sleep research. By framing sleep as a compositional language, NeuroLingua unifies hierarchical sequence modeling and multimodal fusion, advancing automated sleep staging toward more transparent and clinically meaningful applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "NeuroLingua\ub294 \uc218\uba74 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub97c \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ub958\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \uae30\ubc18 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, CNN \uae30\ubc18 \ud1a0\ud06c\ub098\uc774\uc800\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec 30\ucd08 \uc5d0\ud3ec\ud06c\ub97c 3\ucd08 \ud558\uc704 \uc708\ub3c4\uc6b0\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\uace0, \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ud569\uc131 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 EEG \ubc0f EOG \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc218\uba74 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\ub3d9 \uc218\uba74 \ub2e8\uacc4 \ubd84\ub958\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc218\uba74\uc744 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \uc0dd\ub9ac\ud559\uc801 \uc5b8\uc5b4\ub85c \uac1c\ub150\ud654\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud568.", "method": "30\ucd08 \uc5d0\ud3ec\ud06c\ub97c \uacb9\uce58\ub294 3\ucd08 \ud558\uc704 \uc708\ub3c4\uc6b0\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\uace0, \uc774\uc911 \ub808\ubca8 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc2dc\uac04 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uba70, \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ud569\uc131 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud574 EEG \ubc0f EOG \ucc44\ub110\uc758 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0 \ud2b9\ud654 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc744 \uc735\ud569\ud568.", "result": "Sleep-EDF Expanded \ubc0f ISRUC-Sleep \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uac01\uac01 85.3% \ubc0f 81.9%\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub85c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \ucd9c\ud310\ub41c \uae30\uc900\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc77c\uce58\ud558\ub294 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc784.", "conclusion": "NeuroLingua\ub294 \uc218\uba74\uc744 \uc870\ud569 \uc5b8\uc5b4\ub85c \ud504\ub808\uc784\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uacfc \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uc735\ud569\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uba70, \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uc218\uba74 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub97c \ub354 \ud22c\uba85\ud558\uace0 \uc784\uc0c1\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc758\ubbf8 \uc788\ub294 \uc751\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \ubc1c\uc804\uc2dc\ud0b4.", "translated_summary": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc218\uba74 \ub2e8\uacc4 \ubd84\ub958\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ud45c\ud604\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uc2dc\uac04 \uacc4\uce35\uc758 \ubd80\uc871, \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec EEG \ubc0f EOG \uc735\ud569\uc758 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uc2ec\uce35 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ubc1b\ub294\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc218\uba74\uc744 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc0dd\ub9ac\uc801 \uc5b8\uc5b4\ub85c \uac1c\ub150\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc740 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 NeuroLingua\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uac01 30\ucd08 \uc5d0\ud3ec\ud06c\ub294 CNN \uae30\ubc18 \ud1a0\ud06c\ub098\uc774\uc800\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uacb9\uce58\ub294 3\ucd08 \ud558\uc704 \uc708\ub3c4\uc6b0(\"\ud1a0\ud070\")\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ub418\uba70, \uc774\uc911 \ub808\ubca8 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc2dc\uac04 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4: \ub85c\uceec \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc758 \uc138\uadf8\uba3c\ud2b8 \ub0b4 \uc778\ucf54\ub529\uacfc 7\uac1c\uc758 \uc5f0\uc18d \uc5d0\ud3ec\ud06c(3.5\ubd84)\uc5d0 \uac78\uce5c \uc138\uadf8\uba3c\ud2b8 \uac04 \ud1b5\ud569\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5\ub41c \ubb38\ub9e5.

We investigate whether today's language models can assist responders by rapidly and reliably understanding critical information, identifying hazards, and providing recommendations.We introduce the Chemical Emergency Response Evaluation Framework (ChEmREF), a new benchmark comprising questions on 1,035 HAZMAT chemicals from the Emergency Response Guidebook and the PubChem Database. ChEmREF is organized into three tasks: (1) translation of chemical representation between structured and unstructured forms (e.g., converting C2H6O to ethanol), (2) emergency response generation (e.g., recommending appropriate evacuation distances) and (3) domain knowledge question answering from chemical safety and certification exams. Our best evaluated models received an exact match of 68.0% on unstructured HAZMAT chemical representation translation, a LLM Judge score of 52.7% on incident response recommendations, and a multiple-choice accuracy of 63.9% on HAMZAT examinations.These findings suggest that while language models show potential to assist emergency responders in various tasks, they require careful human oversight due to their current limitations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uae34\uae09 \uad6c\uc870\ub300\uc5d0\uac8c HAZMAT \uc0ac\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc774 \ub420 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc774 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc8fc\uc758\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\u5371\u5316\ubb3c \uc0ac\uace0\ub97c \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \uae34\uae09 \uad6c\uc870\ub300\ub294 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \ud654\ud559 \uc9c0\uce68\uc744 \uc218\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\uba70, \uc774 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \uacb0\uc815\uc774 \uc694\uad6c\ub41c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Emergency Response Guidebook \ubc0f PubChem Database\uc758 1,035 HAZMAT \ud654\ud559\ubb3c\uc9c8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc9c8\ubb38\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc778 Chemical Emergency Response Evaluation Framework (ChEmREF)\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4.

Unlike existing foundation models (FMs), which specialize in pattern learning within specific domains such as language, vision, or time series, IFM aims to acquire the underlying mechanisms of intelligence by learning directly from diverse intelligent behaviors. Vision, language, and other cognitive abilities are manifestations of intelligent behavior; learning from this broad range of behaviors enables the system to internalize the general principles of intelligence. Based on the fact that intelligent behaviors emerge from the collective dynamics of biological neural systems, IFM consists of two core components: a novel network architecture, termed the state neural network, which captures neuron-like dynamic processes, and a new learning objective, neuron output prediction, which trains the system to predict neuronal outputs from collective dynamics. The state neural network emulates the temporal dynamics of biological neurons, allowing the system to store, integrate, and process information over time, while the neuron output prediction objective provides a unified computational principle for learning these structural dynamics from intelligent behaviors. Together, these innovations establish a biologically grounded and computationally scalable foundation for building systems capable of generalization, reasoning, and adaptive learning across domains, representing a step toward truly AGI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \uc77c\ubc18(AI) \uc811\uadfc\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uad00\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378(FM)\ub4e4\uc740 \ud2b9\uc815 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \ud328\ud134 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0 \uc804\ubb38\ud654\ub41c \ubc18\uba74, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud558\uace0 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc801\uc778 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c1\uc811 \ud559\uc2b5\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc758 \uae30\ubcf8 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc2b5\ub4dd\ud558\ub824\uace0 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc640 \uc2e0\uacbd \ucd9c\ub825 \uc608\uce21\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uc9d1\ub2e8 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc2e0\uacbd \ucd9c\ub825 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc801\uc778 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0\uc11c \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569\uc801 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc6d0\ub9ac\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc5ec, \ubc94\uc704\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654, \ucd94\ub9ac \ubc0f \uc801\uc751 \ud559\uc2b5\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uad6c\ucd95\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uae30\ubc18\uc7a1\ud78c \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \uc124\ub9bd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774\ub294 \uc9c4\uc815\ud55c AGI\ub97c \ud5a5\ud55c \ud55c \uac78\uc74c\uc73c\ub85c \uac04\uc8fc\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \uc77c\ubc18 \uc9c0\ub2a5(AGI)\uc5d0 \uc811\uadfc\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uad00\uc810\uc744 \uc9c0\ub2a5 \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378(IFM)\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378(FM)\uc774 \uc5b8\uc5b4, \ube44\uc804 \ub610\ub294 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ud2b9\uc815 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ud328\ud134 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0 \uc804\ubb38\ud654\ub41c \uac83\uacfc \ub2ec\ub9ac, IFM\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c1\uc811 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uc5ec \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc758 \uae30\ubcf8 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc2b5\ub4dd\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ube44\uc804, \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubc0f \uae30\ud0c0 \uc778\uc9c0 \ub2a5\ub825\uc740 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9\uc758 \ud45c\ucd9c\uc774\uba70, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ud559\uc2b5\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18 \uc6d0\ub9ac\ub97c \ub0b4\uc7ac\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9\uc774 \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801 \uc2e0\uacbd \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc9d1\ub2e8 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uc0ac\uc2e4\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uc5ec, IFM\uc740 \uc2e0\uacbd\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ub3d9\uc801 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc778 \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uacfc \uc9d1\ub2e8 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc2e0\uacbd \ucd9c\ub825 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc740 \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801 \ub274\ub7f0\uc758 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \ubaa8\ubc29\ud558\uc5ec \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc800\uc7a5, \ud1b5\ud569 \ubc0f \ucc98\ub9ac\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud558\uba70, \uc2e0\uacbd \ucd9c\ub825 \uc608\uce21 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub294 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \ubc30\uc6b0\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569\uc801 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc6d0\ub9ac\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud601\uc2e0\uc740 \ubc94\uc704\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654, \ucd94\ub9ac \ubc0f \uc801\uc751 \ud559\uc2b5\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uad6c\ucd95\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uae30\ubc18\uc7a1\ud78c \uc720\uc5f0\ud55c \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \ud655\ub9bd\ud558\uba70, \uc9c4\uc815\ud55c AGI\ub97c \ud5a5\ud55c \ud55c \uac78\uc74c\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Even for just two halfspaces, it remains a major open question whether learning is possible in polynomial time with respect to the margin $\u03b3$ of the data points and their dimensionality $d$. The best-known algorithms run in quasi-polynomial time $d^{O(\\log(1/\u03b3))}$, and it has been shown that this complexity is unavoidable for any algorithm relying solely on correlational statistical queries (CSQ).\n  In this work, we introduce a novel algorithm that provably circumvents the CSQ hardness barrier. Our approach applies to a broad class of distributions satisfying a natural, previously studied, factorizability assumption. Factorizable distributions lie between distribution-specific and distribution-free settings, and significantly extend previously known tractable cases. Under these distributions, we show that CSQ-based methods still require quasipolynomial time even for weakly learning, whereas our algorithm achieves $poly(d,1/\u03b3)$ time by leveraging more general statistical queries (SQ), establishing a strong separation between CSQ and SQ for this simple realizable PAC learning problem.\n  Our result is grounded in a rigorous analysis utilizing a novel duality framework that characterizes the moment tensor structure induced by the marginal distributions. Building on these structural insights, we propose new, efficient learning algorithms. These algorithms combine a refined variant of Jennrich's Algorithm with PCA over random projections of the moment tensor, along with a gradient-descent-based non-convex optimization framework.", "AI":

We propose this primar- ily stems from spurious correlations arising when models strongly associate highly co-occurring objects during train- ing, leading to hallucinated objects influenced by visual con- text. Current benchmarks mainly focus on hallucination de- tection but lack a formal characterization and quantitative evaluation of spurious correlations in LVLMs. To address this, we introduce causal analysis into the object recognition scenario of LVLMs, establishing a Structural Causal Model (SCM). Utilizing the language of causality, we formally de- fine spurious correlations arising from co-occurrence bias. To quantify the influence induced by these spurious correla- tions, we develop Causal-HalBench, a benchmark specifically constructed with counterfactual samples and integrated with comprehensive causal metrics designed to assess model ro- bustness against spurious correlations. Concurrently, we pro- pose an extensible pipeline for the construction of these coun- terfactual samples, leveraging the capabilities of proprietary LVLMs and Text-to-Image (T2I) models for their genera- tion. Our evaluations on mainstream LVLMs using Causal- HalBench demonstrate these models exhibit susceptibility to spurious correlations, albeit to varying extents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\ud615 \ube44\uc804-\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LVLM)\uc740 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uc5d0\uc11c \uac1d\uccb4\uc758 \uc874\uc7ac\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \ud310\ub2e8\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud558\ub294 \uac1d\uccb4 \ud658\uac01 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uacaa\ub294\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc911 \uac15\ud558\uac8c \ub3d9\uc2dc \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uac1d\uccb4\uc640\uc758 \uc0c1\uad00 \uad00\uacc4\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud658\uac01\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, LVLM\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud5c8\uc704 \uc0c1\uad00 \uad00\uacc4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc815\ub7c9\uc801 \ud3c9\uac00\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud568\uc744 \uc54c\ub9b0\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LVLM\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uac1d\uccb4 \ud658\uac01 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "\uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc778\uacfc \ubaa8\ub378(SCM)\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 LVLM\uc758 \uac1d\uccb4 \uc778\uc2dd \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0 \uc778\uacfc \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0, \ub3d9\uc2dc \ubc1c\uc0dd \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \ud5c8\uc704 \uc0c1\uad00 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uc815\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\uc758\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, Causal-HalBench\ub77c\ub294 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc5ec \ubc18\uc0ac\uc2e4\uc801 \uc0d8\ud50c\uacfc \uc778\uacfc \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc8fc\ub958 LVLM\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uc774 \ud5c8\uc704 \uc0c1\uad00 \uad00\uacc4\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc815\ub3c4\ub85c \ud5c8\uc704 \uc0c1\uad00 \uad00\uacc4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubbfc\uac10\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \ube44\uc804-\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LVLM)\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uac1d\uccb4 \ud658\uac01 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uace0\ud1b5\ubc1b\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uac1d\uccb4\uc758 \uc874\uc7ac\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \ud310\ub2e8\uc744 \ub0b4\ub9b0\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\uac83\uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc911\uc5d0 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ub3d9\uc2dc \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uac1d\uccb4\uc640 \uac15\ud558\uac8c \uc5f0\uad00\ub420 \ub54c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \uc0c1\uad00 \uad00\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc778\ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub294 \ud658\uac01 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uc5d0 \uc911\uc810\uc744 \ub450\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc LVLM\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \uc0c1\uad00 \uad00\uacc4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud615\uc2dd\uc801 \ud2b9\uc131\ud654\uc640 \uc815\ub7c9\uc801 \ud3c9\uac00\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 LVLM\uc758 \uac1d\uccb4 \uc778\uc2dd \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0 \uc778\uacfc \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0, \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc778\uacfc \ubaa8\ub378(SCM)\uc744 \uc218\ub9bd\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc778\uacfc\uc131\uc758 \uc5b8\uc5b4\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub3d9\uc2dc \ubc1c\uc0dd \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \uc0c1\uad00 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uc815\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\uc758\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \uc0c1\uad00 \uad00\uacc4\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc720\ub3c4\ub41c \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubc18\uc0ac\uc2e4\uc801 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub85c \ud2b9\ubcc4\ud788 \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc778 Causal-HalBench\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uace0, \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \uc0c1\uad00 \uad00\uacc4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \uc778\uacfc \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc18\uc0ac\uc2e4\uc801 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ubc18\uc0ac\uc2e4\uc801 \uc0d8\ud50c \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ub3c5\uc810\uc801\uc778 LVLM\uacfc \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8-\uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0(T2I) \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.

Recent work explores using large language models (LLMs) for annotation, but LLM-generated labels still fall short of human-level quality. To address this problem, we propose the Annotation with Critical Thinking (ACT) data pipeline, where LLMs serve not only as annotators but also as judges to critically identify potential errors. Human effort is then directed towards reviewing only the most \"suspicious\" cases, significantly improving the human annotation efficiency. Our major contributions are as follows: (1) ACT is applicable to a wide range of domains, including natural language processing (NLP), computer vision (CV), and multimodal understanding, by leveraging multimodal-LLMs (MLLMs). (2) Through empirical studies, we derive 7 insights on how to enhance annotation quality while efficiently reducing the human cost, and then translate these findings into user-friendly guidelines. (3) We theoretically analyze how to modify the loss function so that models trained on ACT data achieve similar performance to those trained on fully human-annotated data. Our experiments show that the performance gap can be reduced to less than 2% on most benchmark datasets while saving up to 90% of human costs.", "AI": {"tldr": "ACT \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc740 LLM\uc774 \uc8fc\uc11d \uc791\uc131\uc790\uc774\uc790 \ube44\ud3c9\uac00\ub85c \uc791\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc778\uac04 \uc8fc\uc11d \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \uc8fc\uc11d \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uc218\uc9d1\uc774 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4e4\uace0 \uc2dc\uac04\uc774 \uc18c\uc694\ub418\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0, LLM\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc8fc\uc11d\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ucc3e\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "ACT \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, LLM\uc774 \uc8fc\uc11d\uc790\ub85c\uc11c \ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uc624\ub958\ub97c \ube44\ud310\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \uc2ec\uc0ac\uc790\ub85c\uc11c\ub3c4 \uae30\ub2a5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c 2% \ubbf8\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c \uc904\uc774\uace0, \ucd5c\ub300 90%\uc758 \uc778\uac04 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uc808\uac10\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "ACT\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uba70, \uc8fc\uc11d \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 7\uac00\uc9c0 \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uce5c\ud654\uc801\uc778 \uc9c0\uce68\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac10\ub3c5 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \uace0\ud488\uc9c8\uc758 \ub77c\ubca8\ub9c1\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc8fc\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uadf8\ub7ec\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc5bb\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4e4\uace0 \uc2dc\uac04\uc774 \uc18c\uc694\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \uc8fc\uc11d \uc791\uc131\uc5d0 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc548\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\ub098, LLM\uc774 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c \ub77c\ubca8\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc778\uac04 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ud488\uc9c8\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 LLM\uc774 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \uc8fc\uc11d \uc791\uc131\uc790 \uc5ed\ud560 \ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \ube44\ud310\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \uc2ec\uc0ac\uc790\ub85c \uc791\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 '\ube44\ud310\uc801 \uc0ac\uace0\uc5d0 \uc758\ud55c \uc8fc\uc11d'(ACT) \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ud6c4 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \ub178\ub825\uc740 \uac00\uc7a5 '\uc758\uc2ec\uc2a4\ub7ec\uc6b4' \uc0ac\ub840\ub97c \uac80\ud1a0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc9d1\uc911\ub418\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc778\uac04 \uc8fc\uc11d \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uac1c\uc120\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \uae30\uc5ec\ub294 \ub2e4\uc74c\uacfc \uac19\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4: (1) ACT\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc LLM(MLLM)\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \ucc98\ub9ac(NLP), \ucef4\ud4e8\ud130 \ube44\uc804(CV), \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \uc774\ud574 \ub4f1 \ud3ed\ub113\uc740 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

This limitation arises from their substantial hardware requirements, latency constraints, and the necessity to maintain clearly defined knowledge boundaries within a game setting. In this paper, we propose a modular NPC dialogue system that leverages Small Language Models (SLMs), fine-tuned to encode specific NPC personas and integrated with runtime-swappable memory modules. These memory modules preserve character-specific conversational context and world knowledge, enabling expressive interactions and long-term memory without retraining or model reloading during gameplay. We comprehensively evaluate our system using three open-source SLMs: DistilGPT-2, TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat, and Mistral-7B-Instruct, trained on synthetic persona-aligned data and benchmarked on consumer-grade hardware. While our approach is motivated by applications in gaming, its modular design and persona-driven memory architecture hold significant potential for broader adoption in domains requiring expressive, scalable, and memory-rich conversational agents, such as virtual assistants, customer support bots, or interactive educational systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294

In practice, selecting the best checkpoint is challenging: evaluating checkpoints on the validation set during training is computationally expensive and requires a good validation set, while relying on the final checkpoint provides no guarantee of good performance. We introduce an uncertainty-guided approach for checkpoint selection (UGCS) that avoids these pitfalls. Our method identifies hard question-answer pairs using per-sample uncertainty and ranks checkpoints by how well they handle these challenging cases. By averaging the rewards of the top-uncertain samples over a short training window, our method produces a stable and discriminative signal without additional forward passes or significant computation overhead. Experiments across three datasets and three LLMs demonstrate that it consistently identifies checkpoints with stronger generalization, outperforming traditional strategies such as relying on training or validation performance. These results highlight that models solving their hardest tasks with low uncertainty are the most reliable overall.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 RL \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815

However, most existing explanation methods focus on centralized MARL, failing to address the uncertainty and nondeterminism inherent in decentralized settings. We propose methods to generate policy summarizations that capture task ordering and agent cooperation in decentralized MARL policies, along with query-based explanations for When, Why Not, and What types of user queries about specific agent behaviors. We evaluate our approach across four MARL domains and two decentralized MARL algorithms, demonstrating its generalizability and computational efficiency. User studies show that our summarizations and explanations significantly improve user question-answering performance and enhance subjective ratings on metrics such as understanding and satisfaction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubd84\uc0b0 MARL \uc815\ucc45\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\uc5c5 \uc21c\uc11c\uc640 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud611\ub825\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \uc815\ucc45 \uc694\uc57d \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \ud2b9\uc815 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc9c8\uc758\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "MARL\uc774 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc21c\ucc28\uc801 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874 \uc124\uba85 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc774 \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc124\uc815\uc758 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uacfc \ube44\uacb0\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8e8\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubd84\uc0b0 MARL \uc815\ucc45\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\uc5c5 \uc21c\uc11c\uc640 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud611\ub825\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \uc815\ucc45 \uc694\uc57d \uc0dd\uc131 \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc \ud2b9\uc815 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c '\uc5b8\uc81c', '\uc65c \uc548\ub418\ub294\uac00', '\ubb34\uc5c7'\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc9c8\uc758 \uae30\ubc18 \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 MARL \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uacfc \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubd84\uc0b0 MARL \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc5ec \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uacfc \uacc4\uc0b0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc5f0\uad6c \uacb0\uacfc, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc694\uc57d \ubc0f \uc124\uba85\uc774 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc9c8\ubb38 \uc751\ub2f5 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uc774\ud574\ub3c4 \ubc0f \ub9cc\uc871\ub3c4\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc5d0\uc11c \uc8fc\uad00\uc801 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uba40\ud2f0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(MARL)\uc740 \ucd5c\uadfc \uba87 \ub144 \ub3d9\uc548 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uad00\uc2ec\uc744 \uc5bb\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \uc21c\ucc28\uc801 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \uae30\uc874 \uc124\uba85 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uc911\uc2dd MARL\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc5b4 \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0 \ub0b4\uc7ac\ud55c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uacfc \ube44\uacb0\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8e8\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubd84\uc0b0 MARL \uc815\ucc45\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\uc5c5 \uc21c\uc11c\uc640 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud611\ub825\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \uc815\ucc45 \uc694\uc57d\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc \ud2b9\uc815 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc9c8\uc758\uc778 '\uc5b8\uc81c', '\uc65c \uc548 \ub418\ub294\uac00', '\ubb34\uc5c7'\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc9c8\uc758 \uae30\ubc18 \uc124\uba85 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 MARL \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uacfc \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubd84\uc0b0 MARL \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc5ec \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uacfc \uacc4\uc0b0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc5f0\uad6c \uacb0\uacfc, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc694\uc57d \ubc0f \uc124\uba85\uc774 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc9c8\ubb38-\uc751\ub2f5 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 significantly \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uc774\ud574\ub3c4 \ubc0f \ub9cc\uc871\ub3c4\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc5d0\uc11c \uc8fc\uad00\uc801 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uac15\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

To address this problem, we propose a fully differentiable, exemplar-free expandable method composed of two complementary memories: One learns common features that can be used across all tasks, and the other combines the shared features to learn discriminative characteristics unique to each sample. Both memories are differentiable so that the network can autonomously learn latent representations for each sample. For each task, the memory adjustment module adaptively prunes critical slots and minimally expands capacity to accommodate new concepts, and orthogonal regularization enforces geometric separation between preserved and newly learned memory components to prevent interference. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet show that the proposed method outperforms 14 state-of-the-art methods for class-incremental learning, achieving final accuracies of 55.13\\%, 37.24\\%, and 30.11\\%, respectively. Additional analysis confirms that, through effective integration and utilization of knowledge, the proposed method can increase average performance across sequential tasks, and it produces feature extraction results closest to the upper bound, thus establishing a new milestone in continual learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc5f0\uc18d \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c

We draw interest in (i) Machine Learning methods currently utilized for uncovering unknown model structures adaptable to the task of strategic opponent modeling, and (ii) the integration of these methods with Game Theoretic concepts that avoid relying on assumptions often invalid in real-world scenarios, such as the Common Prior Assumption (CPA) and the Self-Interest Hypothesis (SIH). We analyze the ability to handle uncertainty and heterogeneity, two characteristics that are very common in real-world application cases, as well as scalability. As a potential answer to effectively modeling relationships and interactions in multiagent settings, we champion the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNN). Such approaches are designed to operate upon graph-structured data, and have been shown to be a very powerful tool for performing tasks such as node classification and link prediction. Next, we review the domain of Reinforcement Learning (RL), and in particular that of Multiagent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL). Following, we describe existing relevant game theoretic solution concepts and consider properties such as fairness and stability. Our review comes complete with a note on the literature that utilizes PTM in domains other than that of document analysis and classification. The capability of PTM to estimate unknown underlying distributions can help with tackling heterogeneity and unknown agent beliefs. Finally, we identify certain open challenges specifically, the need to (i) fit non-stationary environments, (ii) balance the degrees of stability and adaptation, (iii) tackle uncertainty and heterogeneity, (iv) guarantee scalability and solution tractability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc8fc\ub85c \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd, \uc2ec\uce35 \uac15\ud654

Electroencephalography (EEG), a non-invasive modality with high temporal resolution, has been widely used for brain states analysis. However, most existing EEG models are usually tailored for individual specific tasks, limiting their utility in realistic scenarios where EEG analysis often involves multi-task and continuous reasoning. In this work, we introduce EEGAgent, a general-purpose framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to schedule and plan multiple tools to automatically complete EEG-related tasks. EEGAgent is capable of performing the key functions: EEG basic information perception, spatiotemporal EEG exploration, EEG event detection, interaction with users, and EEG report generation. To realize these capabilities, we design a toolbox composed of different tools for EEG preprocessing, feature extraction, event detection, etc. These capabilities were evaluated on public datasets, and our EEGAgent can support flexible and interpretable EEG analysis, highlighting its potential for real-world clinical applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "EEGAgent\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc911 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uacc4\ud68d\ud558\uace0 EEG \uad00\ub828 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub1cc \ud65c\ub3d9\uc758 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubd84\uc11d\uc740 \uc784\uc0c1 \uc9c4\ub2e8 \ubc0f \uc778\uc9c0 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ubc1c\uc804\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "EEGAgent\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \ud234\ubc15\uc2a4\ub97c \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uc5ec EEG\uc758 \uae30\ucd08 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc778\uc2dd, \uc2dc\uacf5\uac04 \ud0d0\uc0c9, \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8 \uac10\uc9c0, \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc640\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ubc0f \ubcf4\uace0\uc11c \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uacf5\uacf5 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, EEGAgent\ub294 \uc720\uc5f0\ud558\uace0 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c EEG \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "EEGAgent\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc784\uc0c1 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub1cc \ud65c\ub3d9\uc758 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubd84\uc11d\uc740 \uc784\uc0c1 \uc9c4\ub2e8\uacfc \uc778\uc9c0 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ube44\uce68\uc2b5\uc801\uc778 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\uc778 \ub1cc\uc804\ub3c4(EEG)\ub294 \ub192\uc740 \uc2dc\uac04 \ud574\uc0c1\ub3c4\ub85c \ub1cc \uc0c1\ud0dc \ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0 \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uc5b4 \uc654\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874\uc758 EEG \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac1c\ubcc4 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucdb0\uc838 \uc788\uc5b4 EEG \ubd84\uc11d\uc774 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc791\uc5c5 \ubc0f \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\uc6a9\uc131\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ubc88 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uacc4\ud68d\ud558\uace0 EEG \uad00\ub828 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc644\ub8cc\ud558\ub294 \ubc94\uc6a9 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 EEGAgent\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

The main goal of RG is to be both computationally efficient and convenient for game design. The system consists of several languages. The core component is a low-level language that defines the rules by a finite automaton. It is minimal with only a few mechanisms, which makes it easy for automatic processing (by agents, analysis, optimization, etc.). The language is universal for the class of all finite turn-based games with imperfect information. Higher-level languages are introduced for game design (by humans or Procedural Content Generation), which are eventually translated to a low-level language. RG generates faster forward models than the current state of the art, beating other GGP systems (Regular Boardgames, Ludii) in terms of efficiency. Additionally, RG's ecosystem includes an editor with LSP, automaton visualization, benchmarking tools, and a debugger of game description transformations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc77c\ubc18 \uac8c\uc784 \ud50c\ub808\uc774 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc778 Regular Games(RG)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "RG\uc758 \uc8fc\ub41c \ubaa9\ud45c\ub294 \uac8c\uc784 \ub514\uc790\uc778\uc5d0 \ud3b8\ub9ac\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ub9cc\ub4dc\ub294 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "RG\ub294 \uc720\ud55c \uc790\ub3d9\uae30\ub85c \uaddc\uce59\uc744 \uc815\uc758\ud558\ub294 \uc800\uc218\uc900 \uc5b8\uc5b4\ub97c \ud575\uc2ec \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub85c \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uace0\uc218\uc900 \uc5b8\uc5b4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uac8c\uc784 \ub514\uc790\uc778\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "RG\ub294 \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \ube60\ub978 \uc804\ubc29 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\ub978 GGP \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ub2a5\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "RG\uc758 \uc0dd\ud0dc\uacc4\uc5d0\ub294 LSP\ub97c \uac16\ucd98 \ud3b8\uc9d1\uae30, \uc790\ub3d9\ud654 \uc2dc\uac01\ud654, \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud0b9 \ub3c4\uad6c \ubc0f \uac8c\uc784 \uc124\uba85 \ubcc0\ud658\uc758 \ub514\ubc84\uac70\uac00 \ud3ec\ud568\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Regular Games(RG)\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc77c\ubc18 \uac8c\uc784 \ud50c\ub808\uc774(GGP) \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Through the introduction of observational and inductive biases corresponding to the physical nature of the system through data preprocessing and search space restriction, AI Feynman was successful in recovering the first-order analytical form of this equation from lunar ephemerides data. However, this manual approach highlights a key limitation in its reliance on expert-driven coordinate system selection. We therefore propose an automated preprocessing extension to find the canonical coordinate system.

In particular, multimodal learning has emerged as a transformative paradigm, leveraging complementary information from heterogeneous data streams (e.g., text, vision, audio) to advance contextual reasoning and intelligent decision-making. Despite these advancements, current neural network-based models often fall short in open-world environments characterized by inherent unpredictability, where unpredictable environmental composition dynamics, incomplete modality inputs, and spurious distributions relations critically undermine system reliability. While humans naturally adapt to such dynamic, ambiguous scenarios, artificial intelligence systems exhibit stark limitations in robustness, particularly when processing multimodal signals under real-world complexity.

Manual tuning these knobs is laborious and inefficient due to the complex and high-dimensional nature of the configuration space. Among the automated tuning methods, reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods have recently sought to improve the DBMS knobs tuning process from several different perspectives. However, they still encounter challenges with slow convergence speed during offline training. In this paper, we mainly focus on how to leverage the valuable tuning hints contained in various textual documents such as DBMS manuals and web forums to improve the offline training of RL-based methods. To this end, we propose an efficient DBMS knobs tuning framework named DemoTuner via a novel LLM-assisted demonstration reinforcement learning method. Specifically, to comprehensively and accurately mine tuning hints from documents, we design a structured chain of thought prompt to employ LLMs to conduct a condition-aware tuning hints extraction task. To effectively integrate the mined tuning hints into RL agent training, we propose a hint-aware demonstration reinforcement learning algorithm HA-DDPGfD in DemoTuner. As far as we know, DemoTuner is the first work to introduce the demonstration reinforcement learning algorithm for DBMS knobs tuning. Experimental evaluations conducted on MySQL and PostgreSQL across various workloads demonstrate the significant advantages of DemoTuner in both performance improvement and online tuning cost reduction over three representative baselines including DB-BERT, GPTuner and CDBTune.

However, finding a Nash Equilibrium (NE) in large-scale UNSGs is challenging due to their massive and combinatorial action spaces. One common approach to addressing these games is the Policy-Space Response Oracle (PSRO) framework, which requires computing best responses (BR) at each iteration. However, precisely computing exact BRs is impractical in large-scale games, and employing reinforcement learning to approximate BRs inevitably introduces errors, which limits the overall effectiveness of the PSRO methods. Recent advancements in leveraging non-convex stochastic optimization to approximate an NE offer a promising alternative to the burdensome BR computation. However, utilizing existing stochastic optimization techniques with an unbiased loss function for UNSGs remains challenging because the action spaces are too vast to be effectively represented by neural networks. To address these issues, we introduce Tree-based Stochastic Optimization (TSO), a framework that bridges the gap between the stochastic optimization paradigm for NE-finding and the demands of UNSGs. Specifically, we employ the tree-based action representation that maps the whole action space onto a tree structure, addressing the challenge faced by neural networks in representing actions when the action space cannot be enumerated. We then incorporate this representation into the loss function and theoretically demonstrate its equivalence to the unbiased loss function. To further enhance the quality of the converged solution, we introduce a sample-and-prune mechanism that reduces the risk of being trapped in suboptimal local optima. Extensive experimental results indicate the superiority of TSO over other baseline algorithms in addressing the UNSGs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub3c4\uc2dc \ub3c4\ub85c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c

Automatic Identification and Interpretation of Physical Plausibility Failure Modes with Matryoshka Transcoders", "comment": "10 pages, 5 figures", "summary": "Although recent generative models are remarkably capable of producing instruction-following and realistic outputs, they remain prone to notable physical plausibility failures. Though critical in applications, these physical plausibility errors often escape detection by existing evaluation methods. Furthermore, no framework exists for automatically identifying and interpreting specific physical error patterns in natural language, preventing targeted model improvements. We introduce Matryoshka Transcoders, a novel framework for the automatic discovery and interpretation of physical plausibility features in generative models. Our approach extends the Matryoshka representation learning paradigm to transcoder architectures, enabling hierarchical sparse feature learning at multiple granularity levels. By training on intermediate representations from a physical plausibility classifier and leveraging large multimodal models for interpretation, our method identifies diverse physics-related failure modes without manual feature engineering, achieving superior feature relevance and feature accuracy compared to existing approaches. We utilize the discovered visual patterns to establish a benchmark for evaluating physical plausibility in generative models. Our analysis of eight state-of-the-art generative models provides valuable insights into how these models fail to follow physical constraints, paving the way for further model improvements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 Matryoshka Transcoders \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uace0 \ud574\uc11d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc720\ub2a5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uc624\ub958\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub835\ub2e4.", "method": "Matryoshka Transcoders\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uace0 \ud574\uc11d\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc624\ub958 \uc720\ud615\uc744 \uc218\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ud2b9\uc131 \uacf5\ud559 \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uba70, \ud2b9\uc131 \uad00\ub828\uc131\uacfc \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc774 \uc6b0\uc218\ud558\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ubc1c\uacac\ub41c \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \uc124\uc815\ud558\uace0, \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc5ec \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ub530\ub974\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc9c0\uc2dc\ub97c \ub530\ub974\uace0 \uc0ac\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub180\ub77c\uc6b4 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ub208\uc5d0 \ub744\ub294 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uc2e4\ud328\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uc624\ub958\ub294 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uae30\uc874 \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \uc885\uc885 \uac10\uc9c0\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ud2b9\uc815 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc624\ub958 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0 \ud574\uc11d\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 \uc5c6\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uac1c\uc120\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc9c0\ud5a5\uc801 \uc811\uadfc\uc774 \uc5b4\ub835\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uace0 \ud574\uc11d\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Matryoshka Transcoders\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 Matryoshka \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \ud2b8\ub79c\uc2a4\ucf54\ub354 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uc5ec \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc138\ubd84\ud654 \uc218\uc900\uc5d0\uc11c \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ud76c\uc18c \ud2b9\uc131 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4. \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \ubd84\ub958\uae30\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uac04 \ud45c\ud604\uc73c\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\uace0 \ud574\uc11d\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc218\ub3d9 \ud2b9\uc131 \uacf5\ud559 \uc5c6\uc774 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubb3c\ub9ac \uad00\ub828 \uc624\ub958 \uc720\ud615\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0 \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \ud2b9\uc131 \uad00\ub828\uc131 \ubc0f \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubc1c\uacac\ub41c \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uae30\uc900\uc744 \uc124\uc815\ud558\uba70, \uc5ec\ub35f \uac1c\uc758 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ub530\ub974\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uadc0\uc911\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc5ec \ucd94\uac00\uc801\uc778 \ubaa8\ub378 \uac1c\uc120\uc758 \uae38\uc744 \uc5f4\uc5b4\uac04\ub2e4."}}

However, offline RL performance under this constraint is often suboptimal. We consider an alternative approach to dealing with limited samples by introducing the Quantum Metric Encoder (QME). In this methodology, instead of applying the RL framework directly on the original states and rewards, we embed the states into a more compact and meaningful representation, where the structure of the encoding is inspired by quantum circuits. For classical data, QME is a classically simulable, trainable unitary embedding and thus serves as a quantum-inspired module, on a classical device. For quantum data in the form of quantum states, QME can be implemented directly on quantum hardware, allowing for training without measurement or re-encoding.\n  We evaluated QME on three datasets, each limited to 100 samples. We use Soft-Actor-Critic (SAC) and Implicit-Q-Learning (IQL), two well-known RL algorithms, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. From the experimental results, we find that training offline RL agents on QME-embedded states with decoded rewards yields significantly better performance than training on the original states and rewards. On average across the three datasets, for maximum reward performance, we achieve a 116.2% improvement for SAC and 117.6% for IQL.\n  We further investigate the $\u0394$-hyperbolicity of our framework, a geometric property of the state space known to be important for the RL training efficacy. The QME-embedded states exhibit low $\u0394$-hyperbolicity, suggesting that the improvement after embedding arises from the modified geometry of the state space induced by QME. Thus, the low $\u0394$-hyperbolicity and the corresponding effectiveness of QME could provide valuable information for developing efficient offline RL methods under limited-sample conditions.", "AI":

This paper investigates whether discrete acoustic token sequences, derived through vector quantization and gumbel-softmax vector quantization of extracted self-supervised speech model representations can effectively capture and leverage temporal information. To that end, pairwise distance analysis of token sequences generated from HuBERT embeddings shows that they can discriminate call-types and callers across four bioacoustics datasets.

In reinforcement learning, ICL reframes learning as a supervised problem, facilitating task adaptation without parameter updates. Building on prior work leveraging transformers for sequential decision-making, we propose Heuristic Transformer (HT), an in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) approach that augments the in-context dataset with a belief distribution over rewards to achieve better decision-making. Using a variational auto-encoder (VAE), a low-dimensional stochastic variable is learned to represent the posterior distribution over rewards, which is incorporated alongside an in-context dataset and query states as prompt to the transformer policy. We assess the performance of HT across the Darkroom, Miniworld, and MuJoCo environments, showing that it consistently surpasses comparable baselines in terms of both effectiveness and generalization.

However, current approaches to developing such agents remain costly and inefficient, as they typically require manually constructed task datasets and reinforcement learning (RL) pipelines with extensive random exploration. These limitations lead to prohibitively high data-construction costs, low exploration efficiency, and poor sample utilization. To address these challenges, we present AgentEvolver, a self-evolving agent system that leverages the semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to drive autonomous agent learning. AgentEvolver introduces three synergistic mechanisms: (i) self-questioning, which enables curiosity-driven task generation in novel environments, reducing dependence on handcrafted datasets; (ii) self-navigating, which improves exploration efficiency through experience reuse and hybrid policy guidance; and (iii) self-attributing, which enhances sample efficiency by assigning differentiated rewards to trajectory states and actions based on their contribution. By integrating these mechanisms into a unified framework, AgentEvolver enables scalable, cost-effective, and continual improvement of agent capabilities. Preliminary experiments indicate that AgentEvolver achieves more efficient exploration, better sample utilization, and faster adaptation compared to traditional RL-based baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "AgentEvolver\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc790\uae30 \uc9c4\ud654 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac1c\ubc1c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4e4\uace0 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "AgentEvolver\ub294 \uc790\uae30 \uc9c8\ubb38, \uc790\uae30 \ud0d0\uc0c9, \uc790\uae30 \uadc0\uc18d\uc758 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "AgentEvolver\ub294 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 RL \uae30\ubc18 \uae30\uc900\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ub354 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud0d0\uc0c9, \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc0d8\ud50c \ud65c\uc6a9, \ub354 \ube60\ub978 \uc801\uc751\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "AgentEvolver\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \ube44\uc6a9 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uba70 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud574\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uad6c\ub3d9\ub418\ub294 \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ucd94\ub860\ud558\uace0 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uba70 \uc2e4\ud589\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc0dd\uc0b0\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ud604\uc7ac \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\ub294 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\ucd95\ub41c \uc791\uc5c5 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc640 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \ubb34\uc791\uc704 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc774 \ud3ec\ud568\ub41c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL) \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud558\ubbc0\ub85c \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4e4\uace0 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uad6c\ucd95 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \uc9c0\ub098\uce58\uac8c \ub192\uace0 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc774 \ub0ae\uc73c\uba70 \uc0d8\ud50c \ud65c\uc6a9\ub3c4\uac00 \ub5a8\uc5b4\uc9c0\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4e0\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc774\ub04c\uae30 \uc704\ud574 LLM\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \uc774\ud574\uc640 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc790\uae30 \uc9c4\ud654 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc778 AgentEvolver\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.

Current safety benchmarks remain highly limited in both modality coverage and performance evaluations, often neglecting the extensive landscape of content safety. In this work, we introduce OutSafe-Bench, the first most comprehensive content safety evaluation test suite designed for the multimodal era. OutSafe-Bench includes a large-scale dataset that spans four modalities, featuring over 18,000 bilingual (Chinese and English) text prompts, 4,500 images, 450 audio clips and 450 videos, all systematically annotated across nine critical content risk categories. In addition to the dataset, we introduce a Multidimensional Cross Risk Score (MCRS), a novel metric designed to model and assess overlapping and correlated content risks across different categories. To ensure fair and robust evaluation, we propose FairScore, an explainable automated multi-reviewer weighted aggregation framework. FairScore selects top-performing models as adaptive juries, thereby mitigating biases from single-model judgments and enhancing overall evaluation reliability.

Though this problem has been extensively studied in previous work, most existing methods remain susceptible to various adversarial attacks. In this paper, we first study DeCMA2B with adversarial corruption, where an adversary can corrupt reward observations of all agents with a limited corruption budget. We propose a robust algorithm, called DeMABAR, which ensures that each agent's individual regret suffers only an additive term proportional to the corruption budget. Then we consider a more realistic scenario where the adversary can only attack a small number of agents. Our theoretical analysis shows that the DeMABAR algorithm can also almost completely eliminate the influence of adversarial attacks and is inherently robust in the Byzantine setting, where an unknown fraction of the agents can be Byzantine, i.e., may arbitrarily select arms and communicate wrong information.

Existing satellite-based precipitation products often rely on the longwave infrared channel alone or are calibrated with data that can introduce significant errors, particularly at sub-daily timescales. This study introduces Oya, a novel real-time precipitation retrieval algorithm utilizing the full spectrum of visible and infrared (VIS-IR) observations from geostationary (GEO) satellites. Oya employs a two-stage deep learning approach, combining two U-Net models: one for precipitation detection and another for quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE), to address the inherent data imbalance between rain and no-rain events. The models are trained using high-resolution GPM Combined Radar-Radiometer Algorithm (CORRA) v07 data as ground truth and pre-trained on IMERG-Final retrievals to enhance robustness and mitigate overfitting due to the limited temporal sampling of CORRA. By leveraging multiple GEO satellites, Oya achieves quasi-global coverage and demonstrates superior performance compared to existing competitive regional and global precipitation baselines, offering a promising pathway to improved precipitation monitoring and forecasting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \uac15\uc218 \ucd94\uc815 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 Oya\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc9c0\uad6c \uc815\uc9c0 \uc704\uc131\uc758 \uac00\uc2dc\uad11\uc120 \ubc0f \uc801\uc678\uc120 \uad00\uce21\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub354\uc6b1 \uc815\ubc00\ud55c \uac15\uc218\ub7c9 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc815\ud655\ud55c \uac15\uc218 \ucd94\uc815\uc740 \uc218\ubb38\ud559\uc801 \uc751\uc6a9\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\uba70, \ud2b9\ud788 \uc9c0\uad6c \ub0a8\ubc18\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc9c0\uc0c1 \uad00\uce21\ub9dd\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uace0 \uc608\ubcf4 \uae30\uc220\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "Oya\ub294 \uae30\uc0c1\uc704\uc131 \uad00\uce21\uc758 \uc804 \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \uac15\uc218\ub7c9 \ucd94\uc815 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 U-Net \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c \ub450 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc758 \ub525 \ub7ec\ub2dd \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "Oya\ub294 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc9c0\uc5ed \ubc0f \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uac15\uc218 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uac70\uc758 \uc804 \uc138\uacc4\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uac15\uc218 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\uacfc \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uae38\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Oya\ub294 \uac15\uc218 \uc0ac\uac74\uacfc \ube44\uac15\uc218 \uc0ac\uac74 \uac04\uc758 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd88\uade0\ud615\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0, \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc2dc\uac04 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uacfc\uc801\ud569\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uae30\uc5ec\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc815\ud655\ud55c \uac15\uc218 \ucd94\uc815\uc740 \uc218\ubb38\ud559\uc801 \uc751\uc6a9\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc911\uc694\ud558\uba70, \ud2b9\ud788 \uc9c0\uad6c \ub0a8\ubc18\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc9c0\uc0c1 \uae30\ubc18 \uad00\uce21\ub9dd\uc774 \ub4dc\ubb3c\uace0 \uc608\uce21 \uae30\uc220\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc704\uc131 \uae30\ubc18 \uac15\uc218 \uc81c\ud488\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uc7a5\ud30c \uc801\uc678\uc120 \ucc44\ub110\uc5d0\ub9cc \uc758\uc874\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ubcf4\uc815 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc624\ub958\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc790\ub8cc\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uace0, \ud2b9\ud788 \ud558\ub8e8 \ubbf8\ub9cc\uc758 \uc2dc\uac04 \ucc99\ub3c4\uc5d0\uc11c \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc815\uc9c0 \uada4\ub3c4 \uc704\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \uac00\uc2dc\uad11\uc120 \ubc0f \uc801\uc678\uc120(VIS-IR) \uad00\uce21\uc758 \uc804\uccb4 \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \uac15\uc218 \ucd94\ucd9c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc778 Oya\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.

There has been great interest in leveraging biomolecular foundation models as surrogates to accelerate this process. In this work, we show how to obtain scalable probabilistic surrogates of binding affinity for use in Batch Bayesian Optimization (Batch BO). This demands parallel acquisition functions that hedge between designs and the ability to rapidly sample from a joint predictive density to approximate them. Through the framework of Epistemic Neural Networks (ENNs), we obtain scalable joint predictive distributions of binding affinity on top of representations taken from large structure-informed models. Key to this work is an investigation into the importance of prior networks in ENNs and how to pretrain them on synthetic data to improve downstream performance in Batch BO. Their utility is demonstrated by rediscovering known potent EGFR inhibitors on a semi-synthetic benchmark in up to 5x fewer iterations, as well as potent inhibitors from a real-world small-molecule library in up to 10x fewer iterations, offering a promising solution for large-scale drug discovery applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc57d\ubb3c \uac1c\ubc1c\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc778 \ubd84\uc790 \uc124\uacc4\uc758 \ubc30\uce58 \ud569\uc131\uacfc \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0dd\uccb4 \ubd84\uc790 \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc57d\ubb3c \uac1c\ubc1c\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd84\uc790 \uc124\uacc4\uc758 \ubc30\uce58 \ud569\uc131\uacfc \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\uac00 \uc8fc\uc694 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 Batch Bayesian Optimization(Batch BO)\uc5d0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uacb0\ud569 \uce5c\ud654\uc131\uc758 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud655\ub960\uc801 \ub300\ub9ac \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc5bb\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "Prior \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uace0 \ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c \ubbf8\ub9ac \ud6c8\ub828\uc2dc\ucf1c Batch BO\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub110\ub9ac \uc54c\ub824\uc9c4 EGFR \uc5b5\uc81c\uc81c\ub97c \uc7ac\ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uace0 \uc2e4\uc138\uacc4 \uc18c\ubd84\uc790 \ub77c\uc774\ube0c\ub7ec\ub9ac\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc5b5\uc81c\uc81c\ub97c \ub354 \uc801\uc740 \ubc18\ubcf5 \uc218\ub85c \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\ub294 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc57d\ubb3c \ubc1c\uacac \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubd84\uc790 \uc124\uacc4\uc758 \ubc30\uce58 \ud569\uc131\uacfc \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub294 \uc57d\ubb3c \uac1c\ubc1c\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0dd\uccb4 \ubd84\uc790 \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ub300\ub9ac\uc790\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub9ce\uc740 \uad00\uc2ec\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 Batch Bayesian Optimization(Batch BO)\uc5d0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uacb0\ud569 \uce5c\ud654\uc131\uc758 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud655\ub960\uc801 \ub300\ub9ac \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc5bb\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4 \uc0ac\uc774\uc758 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ud5e4\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ubcd1\ub82c \uc218\uc9d1 \uae30\ub2a5\uacfc \uacb0\ud569 \uc608\uce21 \ubc00\ub3c4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e0\uc18d\ud558\uac8c \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.
