However, when exploration is encouraged only at the individual agent level, it often leads to redundancy, as agents act without awareness of how their teammates are exploring. In this work, we introduce Counterfactual Conditional Likelihood (CCL) rewards, which score each agent's exploration by isolating its unique contribution to team exploration. Unlike prior methods that reward agents solely for the novelty of their individual observations, CCL emphasizes observations that are informative with respect to the joint exploration of the team. Experiments in continuous multiagent domains show that CCL rewards accelerate learning for domains with sparse team rewards, where most joint actions yield zero rewards, and are particularly effective in tasks that require tight coordination among agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "CCL \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc740 \ud300 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ub3c5\ud2b9\ud55c \uae30\uc5ec\ub97c \uce21\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \ud611\ub825 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874\uc5d0\ub294 \uac1c\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc218\uc900\uc5d0\uc11c \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc774 \uc7a5\ub824\ub418\uc5b4 \uc911\ubcf5 \ud589\ub3d9\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc788\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \ud300 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub3c5\ud2b9\ud55c \uae30\uc5ec\ub85c \uce21\uc815\ud558\ub294 Counterfactual Conditional Likelihood (CCL) \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc5f0\uc18d \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\ud5d8\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, CCL \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc740 \ud76c\uc18c \ud300 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \uae34\ubc00\ud55c \uc870\uc815\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud2b9\ud788 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "CCL \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc740 \ud300\uc758 \uacf5\ub3d9 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ud558\uc5ec \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c \uad00\ucc30\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ubc0f \uad6c\uc870\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uac1c\ubc29\ud615 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \ud611\uc870 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc774 \uac1c\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc218\uc900\uc5d0\uc11c\ub9cc \uc7a5\ub824\ub420 \ub54c, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ud300 \ub3d9\ub8cc\uc758 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc778\uc9c0\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \ud589\ub3d9\ud558\uac8c \ub418\uc5b4 \uc911\ubcf5\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uac01 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \ud300 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub3c5\ud2b9\ud55c \uae30\uc5ec\ub85c \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 Counterfactual Conditional Likelihood (CCL) \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

For such systems to be deployed in society, agents must be able to establish cooperation and coordination under real-world computational and communication constraints. We propose the FLCOA framework (Five Layers for Cooperation/Coordination among Autonomous Agents) to conceptualize how cooperation and coordination emerge in groups of autonomous agents, and highlight that the influence of lower-layer factors - especially computational and communication resources - has been largely overlooked. To examine the effect of communication delay, we introduce a Continuous Prisoner's Dilemma with Communication Delay and conduct simulations with LLM-based agents. As delay increases, agents begin to exploit slower responses even without explicit instructions. Interestingly, excessive delay reduces cycles of exploitation, yielding a U-shaped relationship between delay magnitude and mutual cooperation. These results suggest that fostering cooperation requires attention not only to high-level institutional design but also to lower-layer factors such as communication delay and resource allocation, pointing to new directions for MAS research.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud611\ub825\uacfc \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uc704\ud55c FLCOA \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc774 \ud611\ub825\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8ec\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2e4\uc81c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ubc0f \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc81c\uc57d \uc18d\uc5d0\uc11c AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud611\ub825\uacfc \uc870\uc815\uc774 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc5f0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uc8c4\uc218\uc758 \ub51c\ub808\ub9c8\uc640 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc9c0\uc5f0\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ub290\ub9b0 \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \uc545\uc6a9\ud558\uae30 \uc2dc\uc791\ud558\uba70, \uc9c0\ub098\uce58\uac8c \uae34 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc740 \ucc29\ucde8 \uc8fc\uae30\ub97c \uc904\uc774\ub294 U\uc790\ud615 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ud611\ub825\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\ub824\uba74 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0\uc801\uc778 \uc81c\ub3c4\uc801 \uc124\uacc4\ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uacfc \uc790\uc6d0 \ubc30\ubd84 \uac19\uc740 \ud558\uc704 \uc694\uc778\uc5d0\ub3c4 \uc8fc\ubaa9\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(LLM-MAS)\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc778 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc774 \ud611\ub825\ud558\uc5ec \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uc8fc\ubaa9\ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc5d0 \ubc30\uce58\ub418\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ud604\uc2e4 \uc138\uacc4\uc758 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ubc0f \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc81c\uc57d \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \ud611\ub825\uacfc \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc5b4\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc758 \uadf8\ub8f9\uc5d0\uc11c \ud611\ub825\uacfc \uc870\uc815\uc774 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uac1c\ub150\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 FLCOA \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c(\uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04 \ud611\ub825/\uc870\uc815\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub2e4\uc12f \uac00\uc9c0 \uce35)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \ud2b9\ud788 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ubc0f \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc790\uc6d0\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ud558\uc704 \uc694\uc18c\uc758 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ub300\uccb4\ub85c \uac04\uacfc\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc758 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uc5f0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uc8c4\uc218\uc758 \ub51c\ub808\ub9c8\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \ud568\uaed8 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc740 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc778 \uc9c0\uc2dc \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 \ub290\ub9b0 \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \ucc29\ucde8\ud558\uae30 \uc2dc\uc791\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud765\ubbf8\ub86d\uac8c\ub3c4, \uacfc\ub3c4\ud55c \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc740 \ucc29\ucde8 \uc0ac\uc774\ud074\uc744 \uc904\uc5ec \uc9c0\uc5f0 \ud06c\uae30\uc640 \uc0c1\ud638 \ud611\ub825 \uac04\uc758 U\uc790\ud615 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ud611\ub825\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0\uc801\uc778 \uc81c\ub3c4\uc801 \uc124\uacc4\ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \ubc0f \uc790\uc6d0 \ubc30\ubd84\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ud558\uc704 \uc694\uc778\uc5d0\ub3c4 \uc8fc\ubaa9\ud574\uc57c \ud558\uba70, MAS \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

These tools provide information that guides non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), yet many struggle to capture complex dynamics while remaining computationally practical and interpretable. We introduce DEpiABS, a scalable, differentiable agent-based model (DABM) that balances mechanistic detail, computational efficiency and interpretability. DEpiABS captures individual-level heterogeneity in health status, behaviour, and resource constraints, while also modelling epidemic processes like viral mutation and reinfection dynamics. The model is fully differentiable, enabling fast simulation and gradient-based parameter calibration. Building on this foundation, we introduce a z-score-based scaling method that maps small-scale simulations to any real-world population sizes with negligible loss in output granularity, reducing the computational burden when modelling large populations. We validate DEpiABS through sensitivity analysis and calibration to COVID-19 and flu data from ten regions of varying scales. Compared to the baseline, DEpiABS is more detailed, fully interpretable, and has reduced the average normal deviation in forecasting from 0.97 to 0.92 on COVID-19 mortality data and from 0.41 to 0.32 on influenza-like-illness data.

TRACE integrates knowledge from 24 structured databases and 3 categories of unstructured data, including APT reports, papers, and repair notices. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), TRACE facilitates efficient entity extraction and alignment, enabling continuous updates to the CKG. Evaluations demonstrate that TRACE achieves a 1.8x increase in node coverage compared to existing CKGs. TRACE attains the precision of 86.08%, the recall of 76.92%, and the F1 score of 81.24% in entity extraction, surpassing the best-known LLM-based baselines by 7.8%.

However, their enormous parameter sizes and memory demands pose major challenges for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Vector Quantization (VQ) offers a promising approach for ultra-low-bit compression in Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging a codebook, where weight vectors are mapped to the most similar discrete codewords. Yet, directly applying VQ to MoEs often leads to substantial performance degradation due to two critical obstacles: (1) redundant representations among experts cause VQ to repeatedly quantize similar representations for each expert, resulting in inefficient use of limited codebook capacity; and (2) cumulative output bias is amplified by expert aggregation in MoE layers, leading to distributional shifts in the quantized outputs. To address these issues, we propose KBVQ-MoE, a novel VQ framework to enhance extremely low-bit quantization for MoE-based LLMs. KBVQ-MoE integrates two techniques: (1) input-driven redundancy elimination, where a Karhunen-Loeve Transform (KLT) guided singular value decomposition (SVD) extracts dominant weight components and shares them across experts; and (2) bias-corrected output stabilization, where vector quantization is applied only to expert-specific (non-redundant) representations and the quantized outputs are corrected via channel-wise affine compensation. Experiments on various MoE LLMs demonstrate that KBVQ-MoE preserves accuracy substantially better than existing quantization methods. For example, 3-bit quantization of Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B achieves an average accuracy of 67.99, nearly identical to the FP16 baseline of 68.07, underscoring KBVQ-MoE's potential for efficient deployment on edge devices and other resource-constrained platforms.", "AI": {"tldr": "KBVQ-MoE\ub294 MoE \uae30\ubc18 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucd08\uc800\ube44\ud2b8 \uc591\uc790\ud654\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 VQ \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc785\ub825 \uae30\ubc18 \uc911\ubcf5 \uc81c\uac70 \ubc0f \ubc14\uc774\uc5b4\uc2a4 \ubcf4\uc815 \ucd9c\ub825 \uc548\uc815\ud654\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "MoE \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub300\ud3ed \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub192\uc740 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \ud06c\uae30\uc640 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc694\uad6c\ub7c9\uc774 \uc790\uc6d0 \uc81c\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubc30\ud3ec\uc5d0 \uc8fc\uc694 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ub41c\ub2e4.", "method": "KBVQ-MoE\ub294 \uc785\ub825 \uae30\ubc18 \uc911\ubcf5 \uc81c\uac70\uc640 \ubc14\uc774\uc5b4\uc2a4 \ubcf4\uc815 \ucd9c\ub825 \uc548\uc815\ud654\uc758 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uae30\uc220\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec MoE \uae30\ubc18 LLM\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ucd08\uc800\ube44\ud2b8 \uc591\uc790\ud654\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c MoE LLM\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c KBVQ-MoE\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \uc591\uc790\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ud6e8\uc52c \uc798 \uc720\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc608\ub97c \ub4e4\uc5b4, Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B\uc758 3\ube44\ud2b8 \uc591\uc790\ud654\ub294 68.07\uc758 FP16 \uae30\uc900\uac12\uc5d0 \uac70\uc758 \uc77c\uce58\ud558\ub294 67.99\uc758 \ud3c9\uade0 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "KBVQ-MoE\ub294 \uc5e3\uc9c0 \ub514\ubc14\uc774\uc2a4 \ubc0f \uc790\uc6d0 \uc81c\ud55c \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ubc30\uce58\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "Mixture of Experts (MoE) \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ud76c\uc18c \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \ud65c\uc131\ud654\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uacc4\uc0b0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uc5ec \ud070 \uc131\uacf5\uc744 \uac70\ub450\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ubc29\ub300\ud55c \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \ud06c\uae30\uc640 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc694\uad6c\ub7c9\uc740 \uc790\uc6d0\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc30\ud3ec\uc5d0 \uc8fc\uc694\ud55c \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubca1\ud130 \uc591\uc790\ud654(VQ)\ub294 \ucf54\ub4dc\ubd81\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd08\uc800\ube44\ud2b8 \uc555\ucd95\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 MoE\uc5d0 VQ\ub97c \uc9c1\uc811 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uba74 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc7a5\uc560\ubb3c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ud604\uc800\ud788 \uc800\ud558\ub418\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4: (1) \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uac04\uc758 \uc911\ubcf5 \ud45c\ud604\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 VQ\ub294 \uac01 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc591\uc790\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ucf54\ub4dc\ubd81 \uc6a9\ub7c9\uc758 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4; (2) MoE \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc9d1\ud569\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ub204\uc801 \ucd9c\ub825 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc774 \uc99d\ud3ed\ub418\uc5b4 \uc591\uc790\ud654\ub41c \ucd9c\ub825\uc758 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc801 \ubcc0\ud654\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 MoE \uae30\ubc18 LLM\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uadf9\ud788 \uc800\ube44\ud2b8 \uc591\uc790\ud654\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 VQ \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 KBVQ-MoE\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

One Figure", "summary": "Enterprises are rapidly deploying large language models, retrieval augmented generation pipelines, and tool using agents into production, often on shared high performance computing clusters and cloud accelerator platforms that also support defensive analytics. These systems increasingly function not as isolated models but as AI estates: socio technical systems spanning models, agents, data pipelines, security tooling, human workflows, and hyperscale infrastructure. Existing governance and security frameworks, including the NIST AI Risk Management Framework and systems security engineering guidance, articulate principles and risk functions but do not provide implementable architectures for multi agent, AI enabled cyber defense.\n  This paper introduces the Practitioners Blueprint for Secure AI (PBSAI) Governance Ecosystem, a multi agent reference architecture for securing enterprise and hyperscale AI estates. PBSAI organizes responsibilities into a twelve domain taxonomy and defines bounded agent families that mediate between tools and policy through shared context envelopes and structured output contracts. The architecture assumes baseline enterprise security capabilities and encodes key systems security techniques, including analytic monitoring, coordinated defense, and adaptive response. A lightweight formal model of agents, context envelopes, and ecosystem level invariants clarifies the traceability, provenance, and human in the loop guarantees enforced across domains. We demonstrate alignment with NIST AI RMF functions and illustrate application in enterprise SOC and hyperscale defensive environments. PBSAI is proposed as a structured, evidence centric foundation for open ecosystem development and future empirical validation.", "AI": {"tldr": "PBSAI\ub294 \uae30\uc5c5\uc758 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ubcf4\uc548\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ucc38\uc870 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc5c5\ub4e4\uc774 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf4\uc548\uacfc \uc704\ud5d8 \uad00\ub9ac\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "PBSAI\ub294 12\uac1c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc73c\ub85c \ucc45\uc784\uc744 \uc870\uc9c1\ud558\uace0, \ub3c4\uad6c\uc640 \uc815\ucc45 \uac04\uc758 \ub9e4\uac1c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uacc4 \uc788\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac00\uc871\uc744 \uc815\uc758\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "PBSAI\ub294 NIST AI RMF \uae30\ub2a5\uacfc \uc77c\uce58\ud558\uba70, \uae30\uc5c5 SOC \ubc0f \ubc29\ub300\ud55c \ubc29\uc5b4 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc801\uc6a9\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "PBSAI\ub294 \uac1c\ubc29\ud615 \uc0dd\ud0dc\uacc4 \uac1c\ubc1c\uacfc \ud5a5\ud6c4 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc99d\uac70 \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \uae30\ucd08\ub85c \uc81c\uc548\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uae30\uc5c5\ub4e4\uc740 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378, \uac80\uc0c9 \ubcf4\uac15 \uc0dd\uc131 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \ubc0f \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc2e0\uc18d\ud558\uac8c \ubc30\ud3ec\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc885\uc885 \ubc29\uc5b4 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \uacf5\uc720 \uace0\uc131\ub2a5 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305 \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130 \ubc0f \ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc \uac00\uc18d\uae30 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc9d1\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uace0\ub9bd\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc544\ub2cc AI \uc0dd\ud0dc\uacc4, \uc989 \ubaa8\ub378, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778, \ubcf4\uc548 \ub3c4\uad6c, \uc778\uac04 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0 \ubc0f \ud558\uc774\ud37c\uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c \uc778\ud504\ub77c\ub97c \uc544\uc6b0\ub974\ub294 \uc0ac\ud68c \uae30\uc220 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc73c\ub85c \uae30\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4 \ubc0f \ubcf4\uc548 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c, NIST AI \uc704\ud5d8 \uad00\ub9ac \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c \ubc0f \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ubcf4\uc548 \uacf5\ud559 \uc9c0\uce68\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uc5ec \uc704\ud5d8 \uae30\ub2a5 \ubc0f \uc6d0\uce59\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubc0f AI \uae30\ubc18 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubc29\uc5b4\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uad6c\ud604 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub294 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uae30\uc5c5 \ubc0f \ud558\uc774\ud37c\uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c AI \uc0dd\ud0dc\uacc4 \ubcf4\uc548\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ucc38\uc870 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc778 PBSAI(Practitioners Blueprint for Secure AI) \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4 \uc0dd\ud0dc\uacc4\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Gaussian Processes (GPs) offer robust probabilistic modeling, but suffer from cubic computational complexity, limiting their applicability in large-scale deployments. To address this challenge, we introduce the pxpGP, a novel distributed GP framework tailored for both centralized and decentralized large-scale multi-robot networks. Our approach leverages sparse variational inference to generate a local compact pseudo-representation. We introduce a sparse variational optimization scheme that bounds local pseudo-datasets and formulate a global scaled proximal-inexact consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) with adaptive parameter updates and warm-start initialization.

While prior work has produced tool calling benchmarks and examined factuality in knowledge augmented systems, relatively little work studies their intersection: settings where LLMs must integrate large volumes of dynamic, structured and unstructured multi tool outputs. We investigate LLM failure modes in this regime using crypto as a representative high data density domain. We introduce (1) CryptoAnalystBench, an analyst aligned benchmark of 198 production crypto and DeFi queries spanning 11 categories; (2) an agentic harness equipped with relevant crypto and DeFi tools to generate responses across multiple frontier LLMs; and (3) an evaluation pipeline with citation verification and an LLM as a judge rubric spanning four user defined success dimensions: relevance, temporal relevance, depth, and data consistency. Using human annotation, we develop a taxonomy of seven higher order error types that are not reliably captured by factuality checks or LLM based quality scoring. We find that these failures persist even in state of the art systems and can compromise high stakes decisions. Based on this taxonomy, we refine the judge rubric to better capture these errors. While the judge does not align with human annotators on precise scoring across rubric iterations, it reliably identifies critical failure modes, enabling scalable feedback for developers and researchers studying analyst style agents. We release CryptoAnalystBench with annotated queries, the evaluation pipeline, judge rubrics, and the error taxonomy, and outline mitigation strategies and open challenges in evaluating long form, multi tool augmented systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uace0\ubc00\ub3c4 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc601\uc5ed\uc778 \uc554\ud638\ud654\ud3d0 \ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0\uc11c LLM(\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378)\uc758 \uc2e4\ud328 \uc0ac\ub840\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc640 \ud3c9\uac00 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud604\ub300 \ubd84\uc11d \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud558\uace0 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc785\ub825\uc744 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud574\uc57c \ud558\uba70, \uc774\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c LLM\uacfc \ub2e4\uc218\uc758 \ub3c4\uad6c \ucd9c\ub825\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "CryptoAnalystBench\ub77c\ub294 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \ub9cc\ub4e4\uace0, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c\uc640 \ud568\uaed8 LLM\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uc778\uc6a9 \uac80\uc99d \ubc0f \ud3c9\uac00 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ud3c9\uac00 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc778\uac04 \uc8fc\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 LLM\uc758 \uc624\ub958 \uc720\ud615\uc744 \ubd84\ub958\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc624\ub958\uac00 \ucca8\ub2e8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uacb0\uc815\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce60 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud3c9\uac00 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc624\ub958\ub97c \ub354 \uc798 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uace0, \uac1c\ubc1c\uc790\uc640 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc790\uac00 \ubd84\uc11d \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub7ec\ube14\ud55c \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud604\ub300 \ubd84\uc11d \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc218\uc2ed \uac1c\uc758 \uac80\uc0c9\ub41c \ubb38\uc11c, \ub3c4\uad6c \ucd9c\ub825 \ubc0f \uc2dc\uac04 \ubbfc\uac10 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud558\uace0 \ub192\uc740 \ud1a0\ud070 \uc785\ub825\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ucd94\ub860\ud574\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uc804 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub3c4\uad6c \ud638\ucd9c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uc9c0\uc2dd \ubcf4\uac15 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc0ac\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud588\uc9c0\ub9cc, LLM\uc774 \ub300\ub7c9\uc758 \ub3d9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ubc0f \ube44\uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ub2e4\uc911 \ub3c4\uad6c \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294 \uc124\uc815\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud55c \uacbd\uc6b0\ub294 \uc0c1\ub300\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc801\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc554\ud638\ud654\ub97c \ub300\ud45c \uace0\ubc00\ub3c4 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc601\uc5ed\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c LLM\uc758 \uc2e4\ud328 \ubaa8\ub4dc\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Existing placement methods typically focus on minimizing wirelength or transforming multi-objective optimization into a single objective through weighted sum, which limits their ability to handle competing design requirements. Wirelength reduction and thermal management are inherently conflicting objectives, making prior approaches inadequate for practical deployment. To address this challenge, we propose TDPNavigator-Placer, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that dynamically optimizes placement based on chiplet's thermal design power (TDP). This approach explicitly assigns these inherently conflicting objectives to specialized agents, each operating under distinct reward mechanisms and environmental constraints within a unified placement paradigm. Experimental results demonstrate that TDPNavigator-Placer delivers a significantly improved Pareto front over state-of-the-art methods, enabling more balanced trade-offs between wirelength and thermal performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc804\uc790 \uc81c\ud488\uc758 \uae09\uc18d\ud55c \uc131\uc7a5\uc73c\ub85c 2.5D \uc9d1\uc801 \ud68c\ub85c \ucc44\ud0dd\uc774 \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ub418\uc5c8\uace0,

However, their performance in real-world deployments often that observed on benchmark settings, especially in complex and imperfect environments. This discrepancy largely arises because prevailing training and evaluation paradigms are typically built on idealized assumptions, overlooking the inherent stochasticity and noise present in real-world interactions. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgentNoiseBench, a framework for systematically evaluating the robustness of agentic models under noisy environments. We first conduct an in-depth analysis of biases and uncertainties in real-world scenarios and categorize environmental noise into two primary types: user-noise and tool-noise. Building on this analysis, we develop an automated pipeline that injects controllable noise into existing agent-centric benchmarks while preserving task solvability. Leveraging this pipeline, we perform extensive evaluations across a wide range of models with diverse architectures and parameter scales. Our results reveal consistent performance variations under different noise conditions, highlighting the sensitivity of current agentic models to realistic environmental perturbations.", "AI": {"tldr":

However, the reliability of this recipe in real-world settings remains unreliable due to environmental uncertainties arising from the sim-to-real gap, model mismatch, and system noise. We address this gap by introducing Distributionally robust IGM (DrIGM), a principle that requires each agent's robust greedy action to align with the robust team-optimal joint action. We show that DrIGM holds for a novel definition of robust individual action values, which is compatible with decentralized greedy execution and yields a provable robustness guarantee for the whole system. Building on this foundation, we derive DrIGM-compliant robust variants of existing value-factorization architectures (e.g., VDN/QMIX/QTRAN) that (i) train on robust Q-targets, (ii) preserve scalability, and (iii) integrate seamlessly with existing codebases without bespoke per-agent reward shaping.

While these protocols support scalable multi-agent interaction and cross-organizational interoperability, their security principles remain understudied, and standardized threat modeling is limited; no protocol-centric risk assessment framework has been established yet. This paper presents a systematic security analysis of four emerging AI agent communication protocols. First, we develop a structured threat modeling analysis that examines protocol architectures, trust assumptions, interaction patterns, and lifecycle behaviors to identify protocol-specific and cross-protocol risk surfaces. Second, we introduce a qualitative risk assessment framework that identifies twelve protocol-level risks and evaluates security posture across the creation, operation, and update phases through systematic assessment of likelihood, impact, and overall protocol risk, with implications for secure deployment and future standardization. Third, we provide a measurement-driven case study on MCP that formalizes the risk of missing mandatory validation/attestation for executable components as a falsifiable security claim by quantifying wrong-provider tool execution under multi-server composition across representative resolver policies. Collectively, our results highlight key design-induced risk surfaces and provide actionable guidance for secure deployment and future standardization of agent communication ecosystems.", "AI":

In this work, we investigate four core questions: RQ1. To what extent do accuracy and confidence rankings established during pretraining persist after SFT? RQ2. Which benchmarks serve as robust cross-stage predictors and which are unreliable? RQ3. How do transfer dynamics shift with model scale? RQ4. How well does model confidence align with accuracy, as a measure of calibration quality? Does this alignment pattern transfer across training stages? We address these questions through a suite of correlation protocols applied to accuracy and confidence metrics across diverse data mixtures and model scales. Our experiments reveal that transfer reliability varies dramatically across capability categories, benchmarks, and scales -- with accuracy and confidence exhibiting distinct, sometimes opposing, scaling dynamics.

Agentic reinforcement learning (RL) has recently emerged as a promising solution for training such agents in multi-turn settings, allowing interaction strategies to be learned from feedback. However, existing pipelines face a critical challenge in balancing task performance with user engagement, as passive agents can not efficiently adapt to users' intentions while overuse of human feedback reduces their satisfaction. To address this trade-off, we propose BAO, an agentic RL framework that combines behavior enhancement to enrich proactive reasoning and information-gathering capabilities with behavior regularization to suppress inefficient or redundant interactions and align agent behavior with user expectations. We evaluate BAO on multiple tasks from the UserRL benchmark suite, and demonstrate that it substantially outperforms proactive agentic RL baselines while achieving comparable or even superior performance to commercial LLM agents, highlighting its effectiveness for training proactive, user-aligned LLM agents in complex multi-turn scenarios.

While Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) provides a formal framework, existing methods often lack the scalability and flexibility required for real-world Unmanned Traffic Management (UTM). We propose DTAPP-IICR: a Delivery-Time Aware Prioritized Planning method with Incremental and Iterative Conflict Resolution. Our framework first generates an initial solution by prioritizing missions based on urgency. Secondly, it computes roundtrip trajectories using SFIPP-ST, a novel 4D single-agent planner (Safe Flight Interval Path Planning with Soft and Temporal Constraints). SFIPP-ST handles heterogeneous UAVs, strictly enforces temporal NFZs, and models inter-agent conflicts as soft constraints. Subsequently, an iterative Large Neighborhood Search, guided by a geometric conflict graph, efficiently resolves any residual conflicts. A completeness-preserving directional pruning technique further accelerates the 3D search. On benchmarks with temporal NFZs, DTAPP-IICR achieves near-100% success with fleets of up to 1,000 UAVs and gains up to 50% runtime reduction from pruning, outperforming batch Enhanced Conflict-Based Search in the UTM context. Scaling successfully in realistic city-scale operations where other priority-based methods fail even at moderate deployments, DTAPP-IICR is positioned as a practical and scalable solution for preflight planning in dense, dynamic urban airspace.", "AI": {"tldr": "DTAPP-IICR\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uacf5\uc720\ub41c \uacf5\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ubb34\uc778\ud56d\uacf5\uae30(UAV) \uad70\uc9d1\uc758 \ube44\ud589 \uc804 \uacc4\ud68d \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 UAV \ud50c\ub9bf\uc758 \ube44\ud589 \uc804 \uacc4\ud68d\uc740 \ub3d9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uacf5\uc720\ub41c \uacf5\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \uae08\uc9c0 \uad6c\uc5ed\uacfc \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ube44\ud589\uae30 \ud2b9\uc131, \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \ubc30\uc1a1 \ub9c8\uac10\uc77c \ub4f1\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uae34\uae09\ub3c4\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ubbf8\uc158\uc758 \uc6b0\uc120 \uc21c\uc704\ub97c \uc815\ud558\uace0, SFIPP-ST\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 4D \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud50c\ub798\ub108\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc655\ubcf5 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uacc4\uc0b0\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7f0 \ub2e4\uc74c \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \uac08\ub4f1 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc548\ub0b4\ub418\ub294 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc774\uc6c3 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc794\uc5ec \uac08\ub4f1\uc744 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "DTAPP-IICR\ub294 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \uae08\uc9c0 \uad6c\uc5ed\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ub300 1,000\ub300\uc758 UAV\ub85c \uac70\uc758 100% \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uac00\uc9c0\uce58\uae30\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ucd5c\ub300 50%\uc758 \uc2e4\ud589 \uc2dc\uac04 \ub2e8\ucd95\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, UTM \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ud654\ub41c \uac08\ub4f1 \uae30\ubc18 \ud0d0\uc0c9\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "DTAPP-IICR\ub294 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uc2dc \uaddc\ubaa8 \uc6b4\uc601\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uba70, \ub300\uccb4 \uc6b0\uc120 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc911\uac04 \ubc30\uce58\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc2e4\ud328\ud558\ub294 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc720\uc6a9\ud558\uace0 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ube44\ud589 \uc804 \uacc4\ud68d \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc73c\ub85c \uc790\ub9ac \uc7a1\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ubb34\uc778\ud56d\uacf5\uae30(UAV) \uad70\ub300\uc758 \ube44\ud589 \uc804 \uacc4\ud68d\uc740 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \ube44\ud589 \uae08\uc9c0 \uad6c\uc5ed(NFZ), \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ube44\ud589\uae30 \ud504\ub85c\ud544, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \ubc30\ub2ec \uae30\ud55c \ub4f1\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804\uc744 \uc548\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uacbd\ub85c \ud0d0\uc0c9(MAPF)\uc740 \uacf5\uc2dd\uc801\uc778 \ud2c0\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \ubb34\uc778 \ud56d\uacf5 \uad50\ud1b5 \uad00\ub9ac(UTM)\uc5d0 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uacfc \uc720\uc5f0\uc131\uc774 \uc790\uc8fc \ubd80\uc871\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc810\uc9c4\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \uac08\ub4f1 \ud574\uacb0 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ubc30\ub2ec \uc2dc\uac04 \uc778\uc2dd \uc6b0\uc120 \uacc4\ud68d \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 DTAPP-IICR\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uba3c\uc800 \uae34\uae09\ub3c4\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ubbf8\uc158\uc758 \uc6b0\uc120 \uc21c\uc704\ub97c \uc815\ud558\uc5ec \ucd08\uae30 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc74c\uc73c\ub85c SFIPP-ST\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 4D \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud50c\ub798\ub108\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc655\ubcf5 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uacc4\uc0b0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4(Safe Flight Interval Path Planning with Soft and Temporal Constraints).

Such defenses can provably block unsafe actions by enforcing confidentiality and integrity policies, but currently appear costly: they reduce task completion rates and increase token usage compared to probabilistic defenses. We argue that existing evaluations miss a key benefit of system-level defenses: reduced reliance on human oversight. We introduce autonomy metrics to quantify this benefit: the fraction of consequential actions an agent can execute without human-in-the-loop (HITL) approval while preserving security. To increase autonomy, we design a security-aware agent that (i) introduces richer HITL interactions, and (ii) explicitly plans for both task progress and policy compliance. We implement this agent design atop an existing information-flow control defense against prompt injection and evaluate it on the AgentDojo and WASP benchmarks.

When downstream data exhibit a substantial distribution shift from the model's prior training distribution, SFT can induce catastrophic forgetting. To narrow this gap, data rewriting has been proposed as a data-centric approach that rewrites downstream training data prior to SFT. However, existing methods typically sample rewrites from a prompt-induced conditional distribution, so the resulting targets are not necessarily aligned with the model's natural QA-style generation distribution. Moreover, reliance on fixed templates can lead to diversity collapse. To address these issues, we cast data rewriting as a policy learning problem and learn a rewriting policy that better matches the backbone's QA-style generation distribution while preserving diversity. Since distributional alignment, diversity and task consistency are automatically evaluable but difficult to optimize end-to-end with differentiable objectives, we leverage reinforcement learning to optimize the rewrite distribution under reward feedback and propose an RL-based data-rewriting agent. The agent jointly optimizes QA-style distributional alignment and diversity under a hard task-consistency gate, thereby constructing a higher-quality rewritten dataset for downstream SFT. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves downstream gains comparable to standard SFT while reducing forgetting on non-downstream benchmarks by 12.34% on average.

Existing benchmarks focus primarily on the computational aspect of this task, testing agents' ability to reproduce or replicate research outcomes when having access to the code and data. This setting, while foundational, (1) fails to capture the inconsistent availability of new data for replication as opposed to reproduction, and (2) lacks ground-truth diversity by focusing only on reproducible papers, thereby failing to evaluate an agent's ability to identify non-replicable research. Furthermore, most benchmarks only evaluate outcomes rather than the replication process. In response, we introduce ReplicatorBench, an end-to-end benchmark, including human-verified replicable and non-replicable research claims in social and behavioral sciences for evaluating AI agents in research replication across three stages: (1) extraction and retrieval of replication data; (2) design and execution of computational experiments; and (3) interpretation of results, allowing a test of AI agents' capability to mimic the activities of human replicators in real world. To set a baseline of AI agents' capability, we develop ReplicatorAgent, an agentic framework equipped with necessary tools, like web search and iterative interaction with sandboxed environments, to accomplish tasks in ReplicatorBench. We evaluate ReplicatorAgent across four underlying large language models (LLMs), as well as different design choices of programming language and levels of code access. Our findings reveal that while current LLM agents are capable of effectively designing and executing computational experiments, they struggle with retrieving resources, such as new data, necessary to replicate a claim.

As distributed critical infrastructure operates in rapidly evolving environments, such as drones in both civil and military domains, there is a growing need for CIDS architectures that can flexibly accommodate these dynamic changes. In this study, we propose a novel CIDS framework designed for easy deployment across diverse distributed environments. The framework dynamically optimizes detector allocation per node based on available resources and data types, enabling rapid adaptation to new operational scenarios with minimal computational overhead. We first conducted a comprehensive literature review to identify key characteristics of existing CIDS architectures. Based on these insights and real-world use cases, we developed our CIDS framework, which we evaluated using several distributed datasets that feature different attack chains and network topologies. Notably, we introduce a public dataset based on a realistic cyberattack targeting a ground drone aimed at sabotaging critical infrastructure. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CIDS framework can achieve adaptive, efficient intrusion detection in distributed settings, automatically reconfiguring detectors to maintain an optimal configuration, without requiring heavy computation, since all experiments were conducted on edge devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ube44\uad50\uc801 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubd84\uc0b0

As researchers create more complex memory architectures, it becomes increasingly difficult to analyze their capabilities and guide future memory designs. Most long-term memory benchmarks focus on simple fact retention, multi-hop recall, and time-based changes. While undoubtedly important, these capabilities can often be achieved with simple retrieval-augmented LLMs and do not test complex memory hierarchies. To bridge this gap, we propose StructMemEval - a benchmark that tests the agent's ability to organize its long-term memory, not just factual recall. We gather a suite of tasks that humans solve by organizing their knowledge in a specific structure: transaction ledgers, to-do lists, trees and others. Our initial experiments show that simple retrieval-augmented LLMs struggle with these tasks, whereas memory agents can reliably solve them if prompted how to organize their memory. However, we also find that modern LLMs do not always recognize the memory structure when not prompted to do so. This highlights an important direction for future improvements in both LLM training and memory frameworks.", "AI": {"tldr": "StructMemEval\uc740 \ub9ac\ud2b8\ub9ac\ubc8c \uc99d\uac15 LLMs \ub300

While object-centric representations provide a useful abstraction, they are not sufficient to capture interaction-dependent dynamics. We therefore propose C-JEPA, a simple and flexible object-centric world model that extends masked joint embedding prediction from image patches to object-centric representations. By applying object-level masking that requires an object's state to be inferred from other objects, C-JEPA induces latent interventions with counterfactual-like effects and prevents shortcut solutions, making interaction reasoning essential. Empirically, C-JEPA leads to consistent gains in visual question answering, with an absolute improvement of about 20\\% in counterfactual reasoning compared to the same architecture without object-level masking. On agent control tasks, C-JEPA enables substantially more efficient planning by using only 1\\% of the total latent input features required by patch-based world models, while achieving comparable performance. Finally, we provide a formal analysis demonstrating that object-level masking induces a causal inductive bias via latent interventions.

While effective for bounded classification tasks, these architectures struggle to support accountable decision-making under adversarial uncertainty, where actions must be justified, governed, and aligned with organizational and regulatory constraints. This paper argues that cybersecurity orchestration should be reconceptualized as an agentic, multi-agent cognitive system, rather than a linear sequence of detection and response components. We introduce a conceptual architectural framework in which heterogeneous AI agents responsible for detection, hypothesis formation, contextual interpretation, explanation, and governance are coordinated through an explicit meta-cognitive judgement function. This function governs decision readiness and dynamically calibrates system autonomy when evidence is incomplete, conflicting, or operationally risky. By synthesizing distributed cognition theory, multi-agent systems research, and responsible AI governance frameworks, we demonstrate that modern security operations already function as distributed cognitive systems, albeit without an explicit organizing principle. Our contribution is to make this cognitive structure architecturally explicit and governable by embedding meta-cognitive judgement as a first-class system function. We discuss implications for security operations centers, accountable autonomy, and the design of next-generation AI-enabled cyber defence architectures. The proposed framework shifts the focus of AI in cybersecurity from optimizing isolated predictions to governing autonomy under uncertainty.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ud604\ub300 AI \uae30\ubc18

In addition, the large 64-element group size enables matrix multiplications to be executed in a highly fixed-point manner, significantly reducing hardware area and power consumption. To evaluate the proposed format, we conducted inference experiments on several language models, including LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral, DeepSeek-V3.1 and LongCat. Results show that HiF4 achieves higher average accuracy than the state-of-the-art NVFP4 format across multiple models and diverse downstream tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "HiFloat4\ub294 \ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \ube14\ub85d \ubd80\ub3d9 \uc18c\uc218\uc810 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud615\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c, \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 NVFP4 \ud615\uc2dd\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub192\uc740 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud615\uc2dd\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "HiFloat4\ub294 64\uac1c\uc758 4\ube44\ud2b8 \uc694\uc18c\uc640 32\ube44\ud2b8\uc758 \uacf5\uc720 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1 \uba54\ud0c0\ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ube14\ub85d \ubd80\ub3d9 \uc18c\uc218\uc810 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud615\uc2dd\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "HiF4\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub2e4\uc6b4\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9bc \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874\uc758 NVFP4 \ud615\uc2dd\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud3c9\uade0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "HiF4\ub294 \ubd80\ub3d9 \uc18c\uc218\uc810 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud45c\ud604 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0 \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucdb0\uc9c4 \ube14\ub85d \ubd80\ub3d9 \uc18c\uc218\uc810 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud615\uc2dd\uc778 HiFloat4(HiF4)\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac01 HiF4 \uc720\ub2db\uc740 32\ube44\ud2b8\uc758 \uacf5\uc720 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1 \uba54\ud0c0\ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \ud568\uaed8 64\uac1c\uc758 4\ube44\ud2b8 \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \ud328\ud0b9\ud558\uc5ec \ud3c9\uade0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac12\ub2f9 4.5\ube44\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uba54\ud0c0\ub370\uc774\ud130\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1 \uacc4\uce35 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uc9c0\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \uadf8\ub8f9 \uac04 \ubc0f \uadf8\ub8f9 \ub0b4\uc758 \ub3d9\uc801 \ubc94\uc704\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uba70 \ud45c\ud604 \uacf5\uac04\uc758 \ud65c\uc6a9\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, 64 \uc694\uc18c\uc758 \ud070 \uadf8\ub8f9 \ud06c\uae30\ub294 \ud589\ub82c \uacf1\uc148\uc774 \uace0\uc815 \uc18c\uc218\uc810 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc2e4\ud589\ub418\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\uc5ec \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uba74\uc801\uacfc \uc804\ub825 \uc18c\ube44\ub97c \ud06c\uac8c \uc904\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ud615\uc2dd\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral, DeepSeek-V3.1, LongCat \ub4f1 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ucd94\ub860 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 HiF4\uac00 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub2e4\uc6b4\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9bc \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 NVFP4 \ud615\uc2dd\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud3c9\uade0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Existing uncertainty proxies focus on single-shot text generation and therefore miss these trajectory-level breakdown signals. We introduce TRACER, a trajectory-level uncertainty metric for dual-control Tool-Agent-User interaction. TRACER combines content-aware surprisal with situational-awareness signals, semantic and lexical repetition, and tool-grounded coherence gaps, and aggregates them using a tail-focused risk functional with a MAX-composite step risk to surface decisive anomalies. We evaluate TRACER on $\u03c4^2$-bench by predicting task failure and selective task execution. To this end, TRACER improves AUROC by up to 37.1% and AUARC by up to 55% over baselines, enabling earlier and more accurate detection of uncertainty in complex conversational tool-use settings.

Prior work primarily focuses on manipulating tool names and descriptions to increase the likelihood of installation by users and selection by LLM agents. However, a successful attack also requires embedding malicious behaviors in the tool's code implementation, which remains largely unexplored.\n  In this work, we bridge this gap by presenting the first systematic study of malicious tool code implementations. We first propose a taxonomy of malicious tool behaviors based on the confidentiality-integrity-availability triad, tailored to LLM-agent settings. To investigate the severity of the risks posed by attackers exploiting coding LLMs to automatically generate malicious tools, we develop MalTool, a coding-LLM-based framework that synthesizes tools exhibiting specified malicious behaviors, either as standalone tools or embedded within otherwise benign implementations. To ensure functional correctness and structural diversity, MalTool leverages an automated verifier that validates whether generated tools exhibit the intended malicious behaviors and differ sufficiently from prior instances, iteratively refining generations until success. Our evaluation demonstrates that MalTool is highly effective even when coding LLMs are safety-aligned. Using MalTool, we construct two datasets of malicious tools: 1,200 standalone malicious tools and 5,287 real-world tools with embedded malicious behaviors. We further show that existing detection methods, including commercial malware detection approaches such as VirusTotal and methods tailored to the LLM-agent setting, exhibit limited effectiveness at detecting the malicious tools, highlighting an urgent need for new defenses.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc545\uc758\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uad6c \ucf54\ub4dc \uad6c\ud604\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574, \ucf54\ub4dc \uad6c\ud604\uc5d0 \ub0b4\uc7a5\ub41c \uc545\uc758\uc801\uc778 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\uc5ec \uc545\uc131 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc758 \uc704\ud5d8\uc131\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc640 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc545\uc758\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc758 \uc124\uce58 \ubc0f \uc120\ud0dd \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\ub294 \ub370 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucdc4\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc545\uc758\uc801\uc778 \ud589\ub3d9\uc774 \ucf54\ub529 \uad6c\ud604\uc5d0 \ub0b4\uc7a5\ub418\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucd98 \uc545\uc758\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uad6c \ud589\ub3d9\uc758 \ubd84\ub958 \uccb4\uacc4\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \ucf54\ub529 LLM\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud574 \uc545\uc758\uc801\uc778 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\ub294 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 MalTool \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "MalTool\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 1,200\uac1c\uc758 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \uc545\uc131 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc640 5,287\uac1c\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc545\uc758\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9\uc774 \ub0b4\uc7a5\ub41c \ub3c4\uad6c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud588\uc73c\uba70, \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud55c \ucf54\ub529 LLM\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \ub192\uc740 \ud6a8\uacfciveness\ub97c \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc545\uc131\ucf54\ub4dc \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ud55c\uacc4\uac00 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubc1d\ud600\ub0b4\uc5b4 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uc218\ub2e8\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud588\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc545\uc758\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uad6c \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uacf5\uaca9\uc790\uac00 \ubc30\ud3ec \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc5d0 \uc545\uc758\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uc5c5\ub85c\ub4dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uac00 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uc124\uce58\ud558\uace0 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc2e4\ud589 \uc911 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc774\ub97c \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\uba74, \ub3c4\uad6c\uac00 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548\uacfc \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc\ub97c \uc704\ud611\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uc804 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc8fc\ub85c \ub3c4\uad6c \uc774\ub984\uacfc \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uc870\uc791\ud558\uc5ec \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uac00 \uc124\uce58\ud558\uace0 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc120\ud0dd\ud560 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc810\uc744 \ub450\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc778 \uacf5\uaca9\uc740 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc758 \ucf54\ub4dc \uad6c\ud604\uc5d0 \uc545\uc758\uc801\uc778 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud574\uc57c \ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc544\uc9c1\uae4c\uc9c0 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \ud0d0\uad6c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc545\uc758\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uad6c \ucf54\ub4dc \uad6c\ud604\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uc18c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uba3c\uc800 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucd98 \uae30\ubc00\uc131-\ubb34\uacb0\uc131-\uac00\uc6a9\uc131 \uc0bc\uc911 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc545\uc758\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uad6c \ud589\ub3d9 \ubd84\ub958 \uccb4\uacc4\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucf54\ub529 LLM\uc774 \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc545\uc758\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uacf5\uaca9\uc790\uac00 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc704\ud5d8\uc758 \uc2ec\uac01\uc131\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc545\uc758\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\ub294 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \ub3c5\ub9bd\ud615 \ub3c4\uad6c \ub610\ub294 \ub2e4\ub978 \ubb34\ud574\ud55c \uad6c\ud604\uc5d0 \ub0b4\uc7a5\ub41c \ud615\ud0dc\ub85c \ud569\uc131\ud558\ub294 MalTool \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

If one were to try to prefetch as much computation as possible, they would attempt to learn a prior over the policies for some yet-to-be-determined reward function. Recent work (forward-backward (FB) representation learning) has tried this, arguing that an unsupervised representation learning procedure can enable optimal control over arbitrary rewards without further fine-tuning. However, FB's training objective and learning behavior remain mysterious. In this paper, we demystify FB by clarifying when such representations can exist, what its objective optimizes, and how it converges in practice. We draw connections with rank matching, fitted Q-evaluation, and contraction mapping. Our analysis suggests a simplified unsupervised pre-training method for RL that, instead of enabling optimal control, performs one step of policy improvement. We call our proposed method $\\textbf{one-step forward-backward representation learning (one-step FB)}$. Experiments in didactic settings, as well as in $10$ state-based and image-based continuous control domains, demonstrate that one-step FB converges to errors $10^5$ smaller and improves zero-shot performance by $+24\\%$ on average.

While existing studies on sequential strategic classification primarily focus on optimizing dynamic classifier weights, we depart from these weight-centric approaches by analyzing the design of classifier thresholds and difficulty progression within a multi-level promotion-relegation framework. Our model captures the critical inter-temporal incentives driven by an agent's farsightedness, skill retention, and a leg-up effect where qualification and attainment can be self-reinforcing. We characterize the agent's optimal long-term strategy and demonstrate that a principal can design a sequence of thresholds to effectively incentivize honest effort.

Code and dataset available at https://github.com/Privatris/AgentLeak", "summary": "Multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) systems create privacy risks that current benchmarks cannot measure. When agents coordinate on tasks, sensitive data passes through inter-agent messages, shared memory, and tool arguments; pathways that output-only audits never inspect. We introduce AgentLeak, to the best of our knowledge the first full-stack benchmark for privacy leakage covering internal channels, spanning 1,000 scenarios across healthcare, finance, legal, and corporate domains, paired with a 32-class attack taxonomy and three-tier detection pipeline. Testing GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Mistral Large, and Llama 3.3 70B across 4,979 traces reveals that multi-agent configurations reduce per-channel output leakage (C1: 27.2% vs 43.2% in single-agent) but introduce unmonitored internal channels that raise total system exposure to 68.9% (OR-aggregated across C1, C2, C5). Internal channels account for most of this gap: inter-agent messages (C2) leak at 68.8%, compared to 27.2% on C1 (output channel). This means that output-only audits miss 41.7% of violations. Claude 3.5 Sonnet, which emphasizes safety alignment in its design, achieves the lowest leakage rates on both external (3.3%) and internal (28.1%) channels, suggesting that model-level safety training may transfer to internal channel protection. Across all five models and four domains, the pattern C2 > C1 holds consistently, confirming that inter-agent communication is the primary vulnerability. These findings underscore the need for coordination frameworks that incorporate internal-channel privacy protections and enforce privacy controls on inter-agent communication.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc804\ub2ec\ub418\ub294 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc \ub9ac\uc2a4\ud06c\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \uce21\uc815\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4.

Recent work by Chakraborty et al, introduced a fair variant under proportionate fairness and obtained a constant-factor approximation by naively selecting the best closest fair input clustering; however, their offline approach requires storing all input clusterings, which is prohibitively expensive for most large-scale applications.\n  In this paper, we initiate the study of fair consensus clustering in the streaming model, where input clusterings arrive sequentially and memory is limited. We design the first constant-factor algorithm that processes the stream while storing only a logarithmic number of inputs. En route, we introduce a new generic algorithmic framework that integrates closest fair clustering with cluster fitting, yielding improved approximation guarantees not only in the streaming setting but also when revisited offline.

However, traditional causal analysis workflows impose significant technical barriers, requiring researchers to possess dual backgrounds in statistics and computer science, while manually selecting algorithms, handling data quality issues, and interpreting complex results. To address these challenges, we propose CausalAgent, a conversational multi-agent system for end-to-end causal inference. The system innovatively integrates Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to achieve automation from data cleaning and causal structure learning to bias correction and report generation through natural language interaction. Users need only upload a dataset and pose questions in natural language to receive a rigorous, interactive analysis report. As a novel user-centered human-AI collaboration paradigm, CausalAgent explicitly models the analysis workflow. By leveraging interactive visualizations, it significantly lowers the barrier to entry for causal analysis while ensuring the rigor and interpretability of the process.", "AI": {"tldr": "CausalAgent\ub294 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc778\uacfc \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub300\ud654\ud615 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc778\uacfc \ubd84\uc11d \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub294 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc640 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud130 \uacfc\ud559\uc758 \uc774\uc911 \ubc30\uacbd\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\uba70, \uc5f0\uad6c\uc790\ub4e4\uc774 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc218\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\uace0 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud488\uc9c8 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uba70 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ud574\uc11d\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294 \uae30\uc220\uc801 \uc7a5\ubcbd\uc774 \uc874\uc7ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "CausalAgent\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(MAS), \uac80\uc0c9 \uc99d\uac15 \uc0dd\uc131(RAG) \ubc0f \ubaa8\ub378 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c(MCP)\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc815\ub9ac, \uc778\uacfc \uad6c\uc870 \ud559\uc2b5, \ud3b8\ud5a5 \uc218\uc815 \ubc0f \ubcf4\uace0\uc11c \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc5c5\ub85c\ub4dc\ud558\uace0 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4\ub85c \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \uc81c\uae30\ud558\uc5ec rigorously\ud558\uace0 \uc778\ud130\ub799\ud2f0\ube0c\ud55c \ubd84\uc11d \ubcf4\uace0\uc11c\ub97c \ubc1b\ub294\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "CausalAgent\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 AI \ud611\uc5c5 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc73c\ub85c, \ubd84\uc11d \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub97c \uba85\ud655\ud788 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uace0 \uc778\uacfc \ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc9c4\uc785 \uc7a5\ubcbd\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ub0ae\ucd94\uba74\uc11c \uacfc\uc815\uc758 \uc5c4\uaca9\uc131\uacfc \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc778\uacfc \ucd94\ub860\uc740 \uc758\ub8cc, \uacbd\uc81c\ud559 \ubc0f \uc0ac\ud68c \uacfc\ud559\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5c4\uccad\ub09c \uac00\uce58\ub97c \uc9c0\ub2c8\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc778\uacfc \ubd84\uc11d \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub294 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc790\uac00 \ud1b5\uacc4 \ubc0f \ucef4\ud4e8\ud130 \uacfc\ud559\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubc30\uacbd\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uba70 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc218\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc120\uc815\ud558\uace0, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud488\uc9c8 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uba70 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ud574\uc11d\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc694\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uae30\uc220\uc801 \uc7a5\ubcbd\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc778\uacfc \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub300\ud654\ud615 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc778 CausalAgent\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc815\ub9ac\uc640 \uc778\uacfc \uad6c\uc870 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3b8\ud5a5 \uc218\uc815 \ubc0f \ubcf4\uace0\uc11c \uc0dd\uc131\uc5d0 \uc774\ub974\uae30\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(MAS), \uac80\uc0c9 \uc99d\uac15 \uc0dd\uc131(RAG) \ubc0f \ubaa8\ub378 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c(MCP)\uc744 \ud601\uc2e0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\ub294 \ub2e8\uc9c0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc5c5\ub85c\ub4dc\ud558\uace0 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4\ub85c \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \uc81c\uae30\ud558\uae30\ub9cc \ud558\uba74 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud558\uace0 \uc778\ud130\ub799\ud2f0\ube0c\ud55c \ubd84\uc11d \ubcf4\uace0\uc11c\ub97c \ubc1b\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.

A primary challenge lies in the trade-off between reward fidelity and density: outcome reward offers high fidelity but suffers from signal sparsity, while process reward provides dense supervision but remains prone to bias and reward hacking. To resolve this conflict, we propose the Adaptive Milestone Reward (ADMIRE) mechanism. ADMIRE constructs a verifiable, adaptive reward system by anchoring trajectory to milestones, which are dynamically distilled from successful explorations. Crucially, ADMIRE integrates an asymmetric credit assignment strategy that denoises successful trajectories and scaffolds failed trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ADMIRE consistently yields over 10% absolute improvement in success rate across different base models on AndroidWorld. Moreover, the method exhibits robust generalizability, achieving strong performance across diverse RL algorithms and heterogeneous environments such as web navigation and embodied tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 Mobile GUI Agent \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uc704\ud55c Adaptive Milestone Reward (ADMIRE) \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc131\uacfc \uac1c\uc120\uacfc \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc7a5\uae30 \uacfc\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \uc2e0\uc6a9 \ud560\ub2f9 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "ADMIRE\ub294 \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc778 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc5d0\uc11c \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\uc81c\ub41c \uc774\uc815\ud45c\uc5d0 \uada4\uc801\uc744 \uace0\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uace0, \ube44\ub300\uce6d \uc2e0\uc6a9 \ud560\ub2f9 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc131\uacf5\ud55c \uada4\uc801\uc758 \uc7a1\uc74c\uc744 \uc81c\uac70\ud558\uace0 \uc2e4\ud328\ud55c \uada4\uc801\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "ADMIRE\ub294 AndroidWorld\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uae30\ubcf8 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc774 10% \uc774\uc0c1 \uac1c\uc120\ub428\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c RL \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uacfc \uc6f9 \ud0d0\uc0c9, \uad6c\ud604\ub41c \uc791\uc5c5\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc740 \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c GUI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc8fc\ub958 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc73c\ub85c \ubd80\uc0c1\ud558\uc600\uc73c\ub098, \uc7a5\uae30 \uacfc\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub0b4\uc7ac\ub41c \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \uc2e0\uc6a9 \ud560\ub2f9 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc8fc\uc694 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub294 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uacfc \ubc00\ub3c4\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\ub294 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4: \uacb0\uacfc \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc740 \ub192\uc740 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc2e0\ud638 \ud76c\uc18c\uc131\uc5d0 \uc2dc\ub2ec\ub9ac\uba70, \uacfc\uc815 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc740 \ubc00\uc9d1\ub41c \uac10\ub3c5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ud3b8\ud5a5\uacfc \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud574\ud0b9\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ucda9\ub3cc\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc774\uc815\ud45c \ubcf4\uc0c1(ADMIRE) \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

We formalize this setting as sequential decision making in context space with priced and stochastic tool executions, making direct planning intractable due to massive state-action spaces, high variance of outcomes and prohibitive exploration cost. To address these challenges, we propose INTENT, an inference-time planning framework that leverages an intention-aware hierarchical world model to anticipate future tool usage, risk-calibrated cost, and guide decisions online. Across cost-augmented StableToolBench, INTENT strictly enforces hard budget feasibility while substantially improving task success over baselines, and remains robust under dynamic market shifts such as tool price changes and varying budgets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc608\uc0b0 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ubc1b\ub294 \ub3c4\uad6c \ubcf4\uac15 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uba70, \ud070 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \uc608\uc0b0 \ud558\uc5d0 \uc678\ubd80 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \ud638\ucd9c\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc608\uc0b0 \uc81c\uc57d \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc678\ubd80 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc758\ub3c4 \uc778\uc2dd \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc \uacc4\ud68d \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 INTENT\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "INTENT\ub294 \uc608\uc0b0\uc758 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \ucda9\uc871\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uae30\uc874 \uae30\ubc95\ub4e4\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba70, \ub3c4\uad6c \uac00\uaca9 \ubcc0\ud654 \ubc0f \ubcc0\ub3d9 \uc608\uc0b0\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc2dc\uc7a5 \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \uacac\uace0\ud558\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc608\uc0b0 \uc81c\uc57d \ud558\uc5d0 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uc608\uce21 \ubc0f \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uba70, \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud574\uacb0\uc5d0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc608\uc0b0 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ubc1b\ub294 \ub3c4\uad6c \ubcf4\uac15 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uba70, \ud070 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \uae08\uc804\uc801 \uc608\uc0b0 \ud558\uc5d0 \uc678\ubd80 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \ud638\ucd9c\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \uc124\uc815\uc744 \uac00\uaca9\uc774 \ucc45\uc815\ub41c \ud655\ub960\uc801 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc2e4\ud589\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \ub9e5\ub77d \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc21c\ucc28\uc801 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uba70, \uc0c1\ud0dc-\ud589\ub3d9 \uacf5\uac04\uc758 \uac70\ub300\ud568, \uacb0\uacfc\uc758 \ub192\uc740 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131, \uae08\uc9c0\ub41c \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ube44\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc9c1\uc811 \uacc4\ud68d\uc774 \ubd88\uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc0c1\ud669\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 INTENT\ub77c\ub294 \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc \uacc4\ud68d \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ubbf8\ub798 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9, \uc704\ud5d8 \uc870\uc815 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\uace0 \uc628\ub77c\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc548\ub0b4\ud558\ub294 \uc758\ub3c4 \uc778\uc2dd \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4. \ube44\uc6a9 \uc99d\ub300 StableToolBench\uc5d0\uc11c INTENT\ub294 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \uc608\uc0b0 \uac00\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uae30\ubcf8\uc120\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uba70, \ub3c4\uad6c \uac00\uaca9 \ubcc0\ud654 \ubc0f \ubcc0\ub3d9 \uc608\uc0b0\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc2dc\uc7a5 \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

Existing LLM serving frameworks fail to distinguish between reasoning and answering phases, leading to performance degradation under GPU memory constraints. We present PASCAL, a phase-aware scheduling algorithm that prioritizes reasoning to reduce TTFT while using controlled preemption and token pacing during answering to preserve Quality-of-Experience (QoE). Our hierarchical scheduler combines instance-level placement with intra-instance execution and enables dynamic migration at phase boundaries to balance load and reduce interference. Across benchmarks using DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B, PASCAL reduces tail TTFT by up to 72% while maintaining answering phase SLO attainment, demonstrating the importance of phase-aware scheduling for reasoning-based LLM deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "PASCAL\uc740 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\ub9c1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 LLM\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \uc751\ub2f5 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub97c \uad6c\ubd84\ud558\uc5ec \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 TTFT\ub97c \uc904\uc774\ub294 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ucd94\ub860 \uae30\ubc18 LLM\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4 Chain-of-Thought(CoT) \ucd94\ub860\uc758 \ucd9c\ud604\uc740 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc5d0\uac8c \ubcf4\uc774\ub294 \ucd9c\ub825 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uacfc TTFT \uc99d\uac00\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc57c\uae30\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "PASCAL\uc740 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub97c \uc6b0\uc120\uc2dc\ud558\uc5ec TTFT\ub97c \uc904\uc774\uace0, \uc751\ub2f5 \ub2e8\uacc4 \ub3d9\uc548 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub41c \uc120\uc810 \ubc0f \ud1a0\ud070 \uc18d\ub3c4\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uacbd\ud5d8 \ud488\uc9c8(QoE)\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ub2e8\uacc4 \uc778\uc2dd \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\ub9c1 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc774\ub2e4.", "result": "DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c PASCAL\uc740 \uc751\ub2f5 \ub2e8\uacc4 SLO \ub2ec\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uaf2c\ub9ac TTFT\ub97c \ucd5c\ub300 72%\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc904\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ucd94\ub860 \uae30\ubc18 LLM \ubc30\uce58\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e8\uacc4 \uc778\uc2dd \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\ub9c1\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd94\ub860 \uae30\ubc18 LLM\uc758 Chain-of-Thought(CoT) \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \ucd9c\ud604\uc740 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc5d0\uac8c \ubcf4\uc774\ub294 \ucd9c\ub825 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uacfc Time-To-First-Token(TTFT) \uc99d\uac00\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 LLM \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc640 \uc751\ub2f5 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub97c \uad6c\ubd84\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uc5ec GPU \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc81c\uc57d \uc544\ub798\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5 \uc800\ud558\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 PASCAL\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc6b0\uc120\uc2dc\ud558\uc5ec TTFT\ub97c \uc904\uc774\uace0, \uc751\ub2f5 \uc911 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub41c \uc120\uc810\uacfc \ud1a0\ud070 \uc18d\ub3c4\ub85c \uacbd\ud5d8 \ud488\uc9c8(QoE)\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ub2e8\uacc4 \uc778\uc2dd \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\ub9c1 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\ub7ec\ub294 \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4 \uc218\uc900 \ubc30\uce58\uc640 \uc778\ud2b8\ub77c \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4 \uc2e4\ud589\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uace0, \ub2e8\uacc4 \uacbd\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ub3d9\uc801 \ub9c8\uc774\uadf8\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \ubd80\ud558\ub97c \uade0\ud615 \uc788\uac8c \ud558\uace0 \uac04\uc12d\uc744 \uc904\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.

This leads to brittle behavior and unnecessary compute, since the same cumbersome configuration is often applied to both easy and hard input queries. We formulate agent configuration as a query-wise decision problem and introduce ARC (Agentic Resource & Configuration learner), which learns a light-weight hierarchical policy using reinforcement learning to dynamically tailor these configurations. Across multiple benchmarks spanning reasoning and tool-augmented question answering, the learned policy consistently outperforms strong hand-designed and other baselines, achieving up to 25% higher task accuracy while also reducing token and runtime costs.

Recently, the focus of GPL has shifted from in-domain to cross-domain scenarios, which is closer to the real world applications, where the pre-training source and downstream target often differ substantially in data distribution. However, why GPLs remain effective under such domain shifts is still unexplored. Empirically, we observe that representative GPL methods are competitive with two simple baselines in cross-domain settings: full fine-tuning (FT) and linear probing (LP), motivating us to explore a deeper understanding of the prompting mechanism. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that jointly leveraging these two complementary branches yields a smaller estimation error than using either branch alone, formally proving that cross-domain GPL benefits from the integration between pre-trained knowledge and task-specific adaptation. Based on this insight, we propose GP2F, a dual-branch GPL method that explicitly instantiates the two extremes: (1) a frozen branch that retains pre-trained knowledge, and (2) an adapted branch with lightweight adapters for task-specific adaptation. We then perform adaptive fusion under topology constraints via a contrastive loss and a topology-consistent loss. Extensive experiments on cross-domain few-shot node and graph classification demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8

In dynamic, partially observable environments, communication is often what reduces uncertainty and makes collaboration possible. This survey reviews multi-agent communication (MA-Comm) through the Five Ws: who communicates with whom, what is communicated, when communication occurs, and why communication is beneficial. This framing offers a clean way to connect ideas across otherwise separate research threads. We trace how communication approaches have evolved across three major paradigms. In Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), early methods used hand-designed or implicit protocols, followed by end-to-end learned communication optimized for reward and control. While successful, these protocols are frequently task-specific and hard to interpret, motivating work on Emergent Language (EL), where agents can develop more structured or symbolic communication through interaction. EL methods, however, still struggle with grounding, generalization, and scalability, which has fueled recent interest in large language models (LLMs) that bring natural language priors for reasoning, planning, and collaboration in more open-ended settings.

Existing defenses, such as Differential Privacy (DP), typically employ indiscriminate noise injection across all parameters, which severely degrades model utility and convergence stability. To address those limitation, we proposes Targeted Interpretable Perturbation (TIP), a novel defense framework that integrates model interpretability with frequency domain analysis. Unlike conventional methods that treat parameters uniformly, TIP introduces a dual-targeting strategy. First, leveraging Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to quantify channel sensitivity, we dynamically identify critical convolution channels that encode primary semantic features. Second, we transform these selected kernels into the frequency domain via the Discrete Fourier Transform and selectively inject calibrated perturbations into the high-frequency spectrum. By selectively perturbing high-frequency components, TIP effectively destroys the fine-grained details necessary for image reconstruction while preserving the low-frequency information crucial for model accuracy. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that TIP renders reconstructed images visually unrecognizable against state-of-the-art GIAs, while maintaining global model accuracy comparable to non-private baselines, significantly outperforming existing DP-based defenses in the privacy-utility trade-off and interpretability.

More importantly, this variance predicts failure: tasks with consistent behavior ($\\leq$2 unique paths) achieve 80--92% accuracy, while highly inconsistent tasks ($\\geq$6 unique paths) achieve only 25--60%, a 32--55 percentage point gap depending on model.

While effective on in-distribution (ID) data, GNNs often encounter out-of-distribution (OOD) nodes with unseen textual or structural patterns in real-world settings, leading to overconfident and erroneous predictions in the absence of reliable OOD detection. Early approaches address this issue from a topology-driven perspective, leveraging neighboring structures to mitigate node-level detection bias. However, these methods typically encode node texts as shallow vector features, failing to fully exploit rich semantic information. In contrast, recent LLM-based approaches generate pseudo OOD priors by leveraging textual knowledge, but they suffer from several limitations: (1) a reliability-informativeness imbalance in the synthesized OOD priors, as the generated OOD exposures either deviate from the true OOD semantics, or introduce non-negligible ID noise, all of which offers limited improvement to detection performance; (2) reliance on specialized architectures, which prevents incorporation of the extensive effective topology-level insights that have been empirically validated in prior work. To this end, we propose LG-Plug, an LLM-Guided Plug-and-play strategy for TAG OOD detection tasks.

Reliance on purely semantic Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) often leads to \"context poisoning,\" where agents generate linguistically plausible but physically invalid configurations due to a fundamental Semantic-Physical Disconnect. To bridge this gap, this work introduces PhyNiKCE (Physical and Numerical Knowledgeable Context Engineering), a neurosymbolic agentic framework for trustworthy engineering. Unlike standard black-box agents, PhyNiKCE decouples neural planning from symbolic validation. It employs a Symbolic Knowledge Engine that treats simulation setup as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem, rigidly enforcing physical constraints via a Deterministic RAG Engine with specialized retrieval strategies for solvers, turbulence models, and boundary conditions. Validated through rigorous OpenFOAM experiments on practical, non-tutorial CFD tasks using Gemini-2.5-Pro/Flash, PhyNiKCE demonstrates a 96% relative improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, by replacing trial-and-error with knowledge-driven initialization, the framework reduced autonomous self-correction loops by 59% while simultaneously lowering LLM token consumption by 17%. These results demonstrate that decoupling neural generation from symbolic constraint enforcement significantly enhances robustness and efficiency.

This paradigm is particularly well-suited for code generation, where holistic structural planning and non-sequential refinement are critical. Despite this potential, tailoring dLLMs for CUDA kernel generation remains challenging, obstructed not only by the high specialization but also by the severe lack of high-quality training data. To address these challenges, we construct CuKe, an augmented supervised fine-tuning dataset optimized for high-performance CUDA kernels. On top of it, we propose a bi-phase curated reinforcement learning (BiC-RL) framework consisting of a CUDA kernel infilling stage and an end-to-end CUDA kernel generation stage. Leveraging this training framework, we introduce DICE, a series of diffusion large language models designed for CUDA kernel generation, spanning three parameter scales, 1.7B, 4B, and 8B. Extensive experiments on KernelBench demonstrate that DICE significantly outperforms both autoregressive and diffusion LLMs of comparable scale, establishing a new state-of-the-art for CUDA kernel generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Diffusion \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(dLLMs)\uc740 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131\uc5d0 \uc801\ud569\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c, CUDA \ucee4\ub110 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub69c\ub837\ud55c \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Chang"], "title": "Right for the Wrong Reasons: Epistemic Regret Minimization for Causal Rung Collapse in LLMs", "comment": "18 pages, 6 tables, 3 figures", "summary": "Machine learning systems that are \"right for the wrong reasons\" achieve high performance through shortcuts that collapse under distributional shift. We show this pathology has a precise causal origin: autoregressive training provides no gradient signal to distinguish association P(Y|X) from intervention P(Y|do(X)), a failure we formalize as Rung Collapse. When outcome-based learning reinforces correct answers obtained through incorrect causal models, the agent becomes entrenched in flawed reasoning, a phenomenon we term Aleatoric Entrenchment. We propose Epistemic Regret Minimization (ERM), a belief revision objective that penalizes errors in causal reasoning independently of task success, and embed it within a three-layer architecture with three contributions grounded in knowledge representation: (1) a Physical Grounding Theorem proving that actions satisfying actuator independence implement valid do-operations, bridging action languages and do-calculus; (2) ERM as a causal belief revision operator satisfying AGM postulates, preventing entrenchment even when the agent succeeds for the wrong reasons; and (3) a failure mode taxonomy that classifies recurring reasoning errors and injects domain-independent guards, enabling cross-domain transfer. We prove asymptotic recovery of the true interventional distribution with finite-sample bounds. Experiments on 1,360 causal trap scenarios across six frontier LLMs reveal that Rung Collapse persists even in reasoning-enhanced models (3.7% for GPT-5.2), that steerability exhibits inverse scaling where advanced models resist generic correction, and that targeted ERM feedback recovers 53-59% of entrenched errors where outcome-level feedback fails.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \uc774\uc720\ub85c \ub192\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uba70, \uc774\uc640 \uad00\ub828\ub41c Rung Collapse\uc640 Aleatoric Entrenchment\ub97c \uc124\uba85\ud558\uace0, \uc5d0\ud53c\uc2a4\ud15c\uc801 \ud6c4\ud68c \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654(ERM) \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uc774\uc720\uac00 \uc798\ubabb\ub420 \ub54c \uc88b\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc5d0\ud53c\uc2a4\ud15c\uc801 \ud6c4\ud68c \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654(ERM)\ub77c\ub294 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \uc9c0\uc2dd \ud45c\ud604\uc5d0 \uae30\ucd08\ud55c \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uae30\uc5ec\uc640 \ud568\uaed8 \uc138 \uce35 \uad6c\uc870\uc5d0 \ub0b4\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "1,360\uac1c\uc758 \uc778\uacfc \ub36b \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c Rung Collapse\uac00 \uc9c0\uc18d\ud558\uba70, ERM \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc774 53-59%\uc758 \uace0\ucc29\ub41c \uc624\ub958\ub97c \ud68c\ubcf5\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc120\ud615\uc801\uc778 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ubc97\uc5b4\ub098\uc57c \ud558\uba70, \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\"\uc62c\ubc14\ub978 \uc774\uc720 \uc5c6\uc774\" \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ub192\uc740 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ubd84\ud3ec \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ubd95\uad34\ub418\ub294 \uc9c0\ub984\uae38\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub192\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \ubcd1\ub9ac\uac00 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc778\uacfc\uc801 \uae30\uc6d0\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc790\uae30\ud68c\uadc0 \ud6c8\ub828\uc774 P(Y|X)\uc640 P(Y|do(X))\ub97c \uad6c\ubcc4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \uc2e4\ud328\ub97c Rung Collapse\ub85c \uc815\ud615\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacb0\uacfc \uae30\ubc18 \ud559\uc2b5\uc774 \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \uc778\uacfc \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5bb\uc740 \uc62c\ubc14\ub978 \ub2f5\ubcc0\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud560 \ub54c, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0 \uace0\ucc29\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 causal reasoning\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \uc131\uacf5\uacfc \ubb34\uad00\ud558\uac8c \ucc98\ubc8c\ud558\ub294 \uc2e0\ub150 \uc218\uc815 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc778 \uc5d0\ud53c\uc2a4\ud15c\uc801 \ud6c4\ud68c \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654(ERM)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \ud589\ub3d9 \uad00\uc810\uacfc do-\uacc4\uc0b0\uc744 \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \uc720\ud6a8\ud55c do-\uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uad6c\ud604\ud558\ub294 actuator independence\ub97c \ub9cc\uc871\ud558\ub294 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud558\ub294 Physical Grounding Theorem, AGM \uac00\uc124\uc744 \ub9cc\uc871\ud558\ub294 \uc778\uacfc\uc801 \uc2e0\ub150 \uc218\uc815 \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc790\ub85c\uc11c\uc758 ERM, \ubc18\ubcf5\ub418\ub294 \ucd94\ub860 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \ubd84\ub958\ud558\uace0 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \uc548\uc804 \uc7a5\uce58\ub97c \uc8fc\uc785\ud558\ub294 \uc2e4\ud328 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ubd84\ub958\ubc95\uc758 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uae30\uc5ec\ub85c \uc774\ub97c \uc138 \uce35 \uad6c\uc870\uc5d0 \ub0b4\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc720\ud55c \uc0d8\ud50c \uacbd\uacc4\ub85c \uc9c4\uc815\ud55c \uac1c\uc785 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc758 \uc810\uadfc\uc801 \ud68c\ubcf5\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5ec\uc12f \uac1c\uc758 \ucd5c\uc804\uc120 LLM\uc5d0\uc11c 1,360\uac1c\uc758 \uc778\uacfc \ub36b \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 Rung Collapse\uac00 \ub17c\ub9ac \uac15\ud654 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc9c0\uc18d\ub418\uba70(GPT-5.2\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0 3.7%), \uc870\uc815 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \uace0\ub3c4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uad50\uc815\uc744 \uc800\ud56d\ud558\ub294 \ubc18\ube44\ub840\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub098\uace0, \ubaa9\ud45c \uc9c0\ud5a5\uc801 ERM \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc774 \uacb0\uacfc \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc774 \uc2e4\ud328\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0 \uace0\ucc29\ub41c \uc624\ub958\uc758 53-59%\ub97c \ud68c\ubcf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.\""}}

Despite these advances, they overlook the potential of directly constraining the initial representations of the input data, which can intuitively alleviate the distribution shift issue and stabilize training. In this paper, we introduce the Tanh function into the initial layer to fulfill such a constraint. We theoretically unpack the convergence property of the temporal difference learning with the Tanh function under linear function approximation. Motivated by theoretical insights, we present our Constrained Initial Representations framework, tagged CIR, which is made up of three components: (i) the Tanh activation along with normalization methods to stabilize representations; (ii) the skip connection module to provide a linear pathway from the shallow layer to the deep layer; (iii) the convex Q-learning that allows a more flexible value estimate and mitigates potential conservatism.

Text-to-Graph-Query-Language (Text-to-GQL) systems act as a translator, converting natural language into executable graph queries. This capability allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to directly analyze and manipulate graph data, posi-tioning them as powerful agent infrastructures for Graph Database Management System (GDBMS). Despite recent progress, existing datasets are often limited in domain coverage, supported graph query languages, or evaluation scope. The advancement of Text-to-GQL systems is hindered by the lack of high-quality benchmark datasets and evaluation methods to systematically compare model capabilities across different graph query languages and domains. In this work, we present Text2GQL-Bench, a unified Text-to-GQL benchmark designed to address these limitations. Text2GQL-Bench couples a multi-GQL dataset that has 178,184 (Question, Query) pairs spanning 13 domains, with a scalable construction framework that generates datasets in different domains, question abstraction levels, and GQLs with heterogeneous resources. To support compre-hensive assessment, we introduce an evaluation method that goes beyond a single end-to-end metric by jointly reporting grammatical validity, similarity, semantic alignment, and execution accuracy. Our evaluation uncovers a stark dialect gap in ISO-GQL generation: even strong LLMs achieve only at most 4% execution accuracy (EX) in zero-shot settings, though a fixed 3-shot prompt raises accuracy to around 50%, the grammatical validity remains lower than 70%. Moreover, a fine-tuned 8B open-weight model reaches 45.1% EX, and 90.8% grammatical validity, demonstrating that most of the performance jump is unlocked by exposure to sufficient ISO-GQL examples.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc138\ud2b8\uc640 \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ubd80\uc871\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 Text-to-GQL \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc774 \uc800\ud574\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 Text2GQL-Bench\ub77c\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569\ub41c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "Text-to-GQL \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc138\ud2b8\uc640 \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ubd80\uc871\uc73c\ub85c \uc800\ud574\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "Text2GQL-Bench\ub294 13\uac1c\uc758 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 178,184\uac1c\uc758 (\uc9c8\ubb38, \ucffc\ub9ac) \uc30d\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 GQL \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc138\ud2b8\uc640 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778, \uc9c8\ubb38 \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654 \uc218\uc900 \ubc0f GQL\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uad6c\ucd95 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uac15\ub825\ud55c LLM\uc870\ucc28\ub3c4 \uc81c\ub85c \uc0f7 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ub300 4%\uc758 \uc2e4\ud589 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4(EX)\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, 3\uc0f7 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \uace0\uc815\ud558\uba74 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uac00 \uc57d 50%\ub85c \uc0c1\uc2b9\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubb38\ubc95\uc801 \uc720\ud6a8\uc131\uc740 70% \ubbf8\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ub41c 8B \uac1c\ubc29\ud615 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 45.1% EX\uc640 90.8% \ubb38\ubc95\uc801 \uc720\ud6a8\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc774 \ucda9\ubd84\ud55c ISO-GQL \uc608\uc81c \ub178\ucd9c\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc9d0\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Text2GQL-Bench\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uacfc \uc5b8\uc5b4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 Text-to-GQL \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc885\ud569\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc778 \uc790\uc6d0\uc73c\ub85c \uc790\ub9ac\ub9e4\uae40\ud560 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uad00\uacc4\uac00 \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\uc11d\uc758 \uae30\ucd08\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Yet current safety mechanisms for LLM agents focus almost exclusively on preventing failures in advance, providing limited capabilities for responding to, containing, or recovering from incidents after they inevitably arise. In this work, we introduce AIR, the first incident response framework for LLM agent systems. AIR defines a domain-specific language for managing the incident response lifecycle autonomously in LLM agent systems, and integrates it into the agent's execution loop to (1) detect incidents via semantic checks grounded in the current environment state and recent context, (2) guide the agent to execute containment and recovery actions via its tools, and (3) synthesize guardrail rules during eradication to block similar incidents in future executions. We evaluate AIR on three representative agent types. Results show that AIR achieves detection, remediation, and eradication success rates all exceeding 90%. Extensive experiments further confirm the necessity of AIR's key design components, show the timeliness and moderate overhead of AIR, and demonstrate that LLM-generated rules can approach the effectiveness of developer-authored rules across domains. These results show that incident response is both feasible and essential as a first-class mechanism for improving agent safety.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \uc0ac\uace0 \ub300\uc751 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 AIR\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \uc774 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uc0ac\uace0 \ub300\uc751 \uc0dd\uc560 \uc8fc\uae30\ub97c \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc124\uacc4\ub418\uc5c8\uc74c\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud604\uc7ac LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc548\uc804 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc740 \uc2e4\ud328\ub97c \ubbf8\ub9ac \ubc29\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc9d1\uc911\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc0ac\uace0 \ubc1c\uc0dd \uc774\ud6c4\uc758 \ub300\uc751 \ubc0f \ud68c\ubcf5 \ub2a5\ub825\uc740 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "AIR\ub294 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc0ac\uace0 \ub300\uc751 \uc0dd\uc560 \uc8fc\uae30\ub97c \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\ud654 \uc5b8\uc5b4\ub97c \uc815\uc758\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc2e4\ud589 \ub8e8\ud504\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc0ac\uace0\ub97c \uac10\uc9c0\ud558\uace0, \uaca9\ub9ac \ubc0f \ud68c\ubcf5 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc2e4\ud589\ud558\uba70, \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uc0ac\uace0\ub97c \ubc29\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uac00\ub4dc\ub808\uc77c \uaddc\uce59\uc744 \ud569\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "AIR\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub300\ud45c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc720\ud615\uc5d0\uc11c 90% \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uc0ac\uace0 \uac10\uc9c0, \uc218\uc815 \ubc0f \uadfc\uc808\uc744 \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc0ac\uace0 \ub300\uc751\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc548\uc804\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c 1\uae09 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc73c\ub85c\uc11c \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc790\uc728 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\ubb34\uc5d0 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc774 \ubc30\uce58\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ud604\uc7ac LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc548\uc804 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc740 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84 \uc0ac\uc804 \uc2e4\ud328 \ubc29\uc9c0\uc5d0\ub9cc \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc0ac\uace0\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud55c \ud6c4 \uc774\uc5d0 \ub300\uc751, \ucc28\ub2e8 \ub610\ub294 \ud68c\ubcf5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc740 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \uc0ac\uace0 \ub300\uc751 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 AIR\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

InvestESG is a recently proposed multi-agent simulation that captures the dynamic interplay between investors and companies under climate risk. We provide a formal characterization of the conditions under which InvestESG exhibits an intertemporal social dilemma, deriving theoretical thresholds at which individual incentives diverge from collective welfare. Building on this, we apply Advantage Alignment, a scalable opponent shaping algorithm shown to be effective in general-sum games, to influence agent learning in InvestESG.

However, multi-turn RL remains challenging as rewards are often sparse or delayed, and environments can be stochastic. In this regime, naive trajectory sampling can hinder exploitation and induce mode collapse. We propose TSR (Trajectory-Search Rollouts), a training-time approach that repurposes test-time scaling ideas for improved per-turn rollout generation. TSR performs lightweight tree-style search to construct high-quality trajectories by selecting high-scoring actions at each turn using task-specific feedback. This improves rollout quality and stabilizes learning while leaving the underlying optimization objective unchanged, making TSR optimizer-agnostic. We instantiate TSR with best-of-N, beam, and shallow lookahead search, and pair it with PPO and GRPO, achieving up to 15% performance gains and more stable learning on Sokoban, FrozenLake, and WebShop tasks at a one-time increase in training compute. By moving search from inference time to the rollout stage of training, TSR provides a simple and general mechanism for stronger multi-turn agent learning, complementary to existing frameworks and rejection-sampling-style selection methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uae30\uc874 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc640 \uc120\ud0dd \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ubcf4\uc644\ud558\ub294 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 TSR\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc73c\ub85c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \ud134 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub824\ub294 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \ucee4\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "TSR(Trajectory-Search Rollouts)\uc740 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc758 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1 \uc544\uc774\ub514\uc5b4\ub97c \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac01 \ud134\uc5d0\uc11c \uace0\ub4dd\uc810 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\uace0 \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \uada4\uc801\uc744 \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uacbd\ub7c9 \ud2b8\ub9ac \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c\uc758 \uac80\uc0c9\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "Sokoban, FrozenLake, WebShop \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c 15%\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\uace0, \ud6c8\ub828 \uacc4\uc0b0\ub7c9\uc744 \ud55c \ubc88 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ucf1c \ub354 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "TSR\uc740 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6c8\ub828\uc758 \ub864\uc544\uc6c3 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub85c \uac80\uc0c9\uc744 \uc774\ub3d9\uc2dc\ud0b4\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ub354 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \ud134 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uac04\ub2e8\ud558\uace0 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \uacfc\uc81c \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud134 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\ud658\uc744 \uc774\ub04c\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud134 RL\uc740 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ub4f1\uc774 \uc885\uc885 \ud76c\uc18c\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc9c0\uc5f0\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uace0 \ud658\uacbd\uc774 \ud655\ub960\uc801\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uacbd\uc6b0, \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \uada4\uc801 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uc740 \ucc29\ucde8\ub97c \uc800\ud574\ud558\uace0 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ubd95\uad34\ub97c \uc720\ubc1c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 TSR(Trajectory-Search Rollouts)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub41c \ud134 \ub864\uc544\uc6c3 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1 \uc544\uc774\ub514\uc5b4\ub97c \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.

This nonstationarity challenges theoretical analysis, as it violates classical assumptions of i.i.d. (independent and identically distributed) samples, necessitating algorithms capable of real-time updates without expensive retraining. An effective approach should process each sample in a single pass, while maintaining computational and memory complexities independent of the data stream length. Motivated by these challenges, this paper investigates the Momentum Least Mean Squares (MLMS) algorithm as an adaptive identification tool, leveraging its computational simplicity and online processing capabilities. Theoretically, we derive tracking performance and regret bounds for the MLMS in time-varying stochastic linear systems under various practical conditions. Unlike classical LMS, whose stability can be characterized by first-order random vector difference equations, MLMS introduces an additional dynamical state due to momentum, leading to second-order time-varying random vector difference equations whose stability analysis hinges on more complicated products of random matrices, which poses a substantially challenging problem to resolve. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data streams demonstrate that MLMS achieves rapid adaptation and robust tracking, in agreement with our theoretical results especially in nonstationary settings, highlighting its promise for modern streaming and online learning applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc801\uc774\uba70 \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0

To address this problem, we propose LAVES, a hierarchical LLM-based multi-agent system for generating high-quality instructional videos from educational problems. The LAVES formulates educational video generation as a multi-objective task that simultaneously demands correct step-by-step reasoning, pedagogically coherent narration, semantically faithful visual demonstrations, and precise audio--visual alignment. To address the limitations of prior approaches--including low procedural fidelity, high production cost, and limited controllability--LAVES decomposes the generation workflow into specialized agents coordinated by a central Orchestrating Agent with explicit quality gates and iterative critique mechanisms. Specifically, the Orchestrating Agent supervises a Solution Agent for rigorous problem solving, an Illustration Agent that produces executable visualization codes, and a Narration Agent for learner-oriented instructional scripts. In addition, all outputs from the working agents are subject to semantic critique, rule-based constraints, and tool-based compilation checks. Rather than directly synthesizing pixels, the system constructs a structured executable video script that is deterministically compiled into synchronized visuals and narration using template-driven assembly rules, enabling fully automated end-to-end production without manual editing. In large-scale deployments, LAVES achieves a throughput exceeding one million videos per day, delivering over a 95% reduction in cost compared to current industry-standard approaches while maintaining a high acceptance rate.", "AI": {"tldr": "LAVES\ub294 \uad50\uc721 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \uad50\uc721 \ube44\ub514\uc624\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc73c\ub85c, \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uacfc \uc9c0\uc2dd \ud45c\ud604\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uad50\uc721 \ubbf8\ub514\uc5b4 \uc81c\uc791\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ucd5c\uadfc\uc758 \uc601\uc0c1 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uc740 \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \ucf58\ud150\uce20 \uc81c\uc791\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uad50\uc721 \ubc0f \uac15\uc758 \ubbf8\ub514\uc5b4\ucc98\ub7fc \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801 rigor\uc640 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc9c0\uc2dd \ud45c\ud604\uc774 \uc694\uad6c\ub418\ub294 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud55c\uacc4\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "LAVES\ub294 \uad50\uc721 \ube44\ub514\uc624 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uc62c\ubc14\ub978 \ub2e8\uacc4\ubcc4 \ucd94\ub860, \uad50\uc721\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \ub0b4\ub808\uc774\uc158, \uc758\ubbf8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \uc2dc\uc5f0, \uc815\ubc00\ud55c \uc624\ub514\uc624-\ube44\uc8fc\uc5bc \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uc694\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc0dd\uc131 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub97c \uc804\ubb38 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\uace0 \uc911\uc559 \uc870\uc815 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ud488\uc9c8 \uac8c\uc774\ud2b8 \ubc0f \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801 \ube44\ud310 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "LAVES\ub294 \ud558\ub8e8\uc5d0 \ubc31\ub9cc \uac1c \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \ube44\ub514\uc624\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ud604\uc7ac \uc0b0\uc5c5 \ud45c\uc900 \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud574 95% \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \ube44\uc6a9 \uc808\uac10\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0 \ub192\uc740 \uc218\uc6a9\ub960\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc801 \ube44\ud310, \uaddc\uce59 \uae30\ubc18 \uc81c\uc57d \ubc0f \ub3c4\uad6c \uae30\ubc18 \ucef4\ud30c\uc77c \uac80\uc0ac\ub97c \uac70\uce58\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \uc218\ub3d9 \ud3b8\uc9d1 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc644\uc804 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uc885\ub2e8 \uac04 \uc81c\uc791\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc\uc758 \ub05d\uc5d0\uc11c \ub05d\uc73c\ub85c \uc5f0\uacb0\ub41c \ube44\ub514\uc624 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uc740 \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \ucf58\ud150\uce20 \uc81c\uc791\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uad50\uc721\uc801\uc774\uace0 instructional media\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc5c4\uaca9\uc131\uacfc \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc9c0\uc2dd \ud45c\ud604\uc774 \uc694\uad6c\ub418\ub294 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uad50\uc721 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \uad50\uc721 \ube44\ub514\uc624\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uacc4\uce35\uc801 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc778 LAVES\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

Existing methods based on model level or representation level knowledge transfer either require expensive local training or incur high communication costs and introduce unavoidable privacy risks. We reformulate this problem as a reinforcement learning style evaluation process and propose FedGRPO, a privacy preserving framework comprising two modules. The first module performs competence-based expert selection by building a lightweight confidence graph from auxiliary data to identify the most suitable clients for each question. The second module leverages the \"Group Relative\" concept from the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework by packaging each question together with its solution rationale into candidate policies, dispatching these policies to a selected subset of expert clients, and aggregating solely the resulting scalar reward signals via a federated group-relative loss function. By exchanging reward values instead of data or model updates, FedGRPO reduces privacy risk and communication overhead while enabling parallel evaluation across heterogeneous devices. Empirical results on diverse domain tasks demonstrate that FedGRPO achieves superior downstream accuracy and communication efficiency compared to conventional FedFMs baselines.", "AI": {"tldr":

To achieve more ambitious goals, AI agents need to be able to meaningfully decompose problems into manageable sub-components, and safely delegate their completion across to other AI agents and humans alike. Yet, existing task decomposition and delegation methods rely on simple heuristics, and are not able to dynamically adapt to environmental changes and robustly handle unexpected failures. Here we propose an adaptive framework for intelligent AI delegation - a sequence of decisions involving task allocation, that also incorporates transfer of authority, responsibility, accountability, clear specifications regarding roles and boundaries, clarity of intent, and mechanisms for establishing trust between the two (or more) parties. The proposed framework is applicable to both human and AI delegators and delegatees in complex delegation networks, aiming to inform the development of protocols in the emerging agentic web.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc798 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc5b4\uc57c \ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uad00\ub9ac \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud558\uc704 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub85c \uc758\ubbf8 \uc788\uac8c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\uace0, AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \uc778\uac04\uc5d0\uac8c \uc548\uc804\ud558\uac8c \uc704\uc784\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc5b4\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc801\uc751\ud615 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud560\ub2f9, \uad8c\ud55c \uc774\uc804, \ucc45\uc784, \uc5ed\ud560 \ubc0f \uacbd\uacc4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uba85\ud655\ud55c \uc0ac\uc591, \uc758\ub3c4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uba85\ud655\uc131, \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\ub294 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \uc77c\ub828\uc758 \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ub0b4\ub9b0\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc704\uc784 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uac04\uacfc AI \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uac8c \uc801\uc6a9\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc801 \uc6f9\uc5d0\uc11c \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \uc54c\ub9ac\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub354 \uc57c\uc2ec\ucc2c \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uad00\ub9ac \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud558\uc704 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub85c \uc758\ubbf8 \uc788\uac8c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \uc778\uac04 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uac8c \uc548\uc804\ud558\uac8c \uc704\uc784\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc5b4\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc791\uc5c5 \ubd84\ud574 \ubc0f \uc704\uc784 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ud658\uacbd \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc801\uc751\ud558\uace0 \uc608\uc0c1\uce58 \ubabb\ud55c \uc2e4\ud328\ub97c \uac15\ub825\ud558\uac8c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5ec\uae30\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc9c0\ub2a5\ud615 AI \uc704\uc784\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud560\ub2f9\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uc77c\ub828\uc758 \uacb0\uc815\uc73c\ub85c, \uad8c\ud55c, \ucc45\uc784, \ucc45\uc784, \uc5ed\ud560 \ubc0f \uacbd\uacc4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uba85\ud655\ud55c \uc0ac\uc591, \uc758\ub3c4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uba85\ud655\uc131 \ubc0f \ub450 \uac1c \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \ub2f9\uc0ac\uc790 \uac04\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0 \uad6c\ucd95 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc704\uc784 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uac04 \ubc0f AI \uc704\uc784\uc790\uc640 \uc704\uc784\ubc1b\ub294 \uc790 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uac8c \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uba70, \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc6f9\uc5d0\uc11c \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \uc54c\ub9ac\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

This execution pattern repeatedly processes the same prompt prefix across models. Consequently, each model redundantly executes the prefill stage and maintains its own key-value (KV) cache, increasing aggregate prefill load and worsening tail latency by intensifying prefill-decode interference in existing LLM serving stacks. Disaggregated serving reduces such interference by placing prefill and decode on separate GPUs, but disaggregation does not fundamentally eliminate inter-model redundancy in computation and KV storage for the same prompt. To address this issue, we propose PrefillShare, a novel algorithm that enables sharing the prefill stage across multiple models in a disaggregated setting. PrefillShare factorizes the model into prefill and decode modules, freezes the prefill module, and fine-tunes only the decode module. This design allows multiple task-specific models to share a prefill module and the KV cache generated for the same prompt. We further introduce a routing mechanism that enables effective prefill sharing across heterogeneous models in a vLLM-based disaggregated system.

Existing automated methods primarily follow two paradigms: Decoupled Factor Generation, which treats factor discovery as isolated events, and Iterative Factor Evolution, which focuses on local parent-child refinements. However, both paradigms lack a global structural view, often treating factor pools as unstructured collections or fragmented chains, which leads to redundant search and limited diversity. To address these limitations, we introduce AlphaPROBE (Alpha Mining via Principled Retrieval and On-graph Biased Evolution), a framework that reframes alpha mining as the strategic navigation of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). By modeling factors as nodes and evolutionary links as edges, AlphaPROBE treats the factor pool as a dynamic, interconnected ecosystem. The framework consists of two core components: a Bayesian Factor Retriever that identifies high-potential seeds by balancing exploitation and exploration through a posterior probability model, and a DAG-aware Factor Generator that leverages the full ancestral trace of factors to produce context-aware, nonredundant optimizations. Extensive experiments on three major Chinese stock market datasets against 8 competitive baselines demonstrate that AlphaPROBE significantly gains enhanced performance in predictive accuracy, return stability and training efficiency. Our results confirm that leveraging global evolutionary topology is essential for efficient and robust automated alpha discovery.

Traditional approaches rely on probabilistic models to account for the uncertainty, but often require explicit noise assumptions, in turn limiting generalization. In this work, we contribute a novel method to learn a structured latent representation, in which distances between states directly correlate with the minimum number of actions required to transition between them. The proposed metric space formulation provides a geometric interpretation of uncertainty without the need for explicit probabilistic modeling. To achieve this, we introduce a multimodal latent transition model and a sensor fusion mechanism based on inverse distance weighting, allowing for the adaptive integration of multiple sensor modalities without prior knowledge of noise distributions. We empirically validate the approach on a range of multimodal RL tasks, demonstrating improved robustness to sensor noise and superior state estimation compared to baseline methods. Our experiments show enhanced performance of an RL agent via the learned representation, eliminating the need of explicit noise augmentation. The presented results suggest that leveraging transition-aware metric spaces provides a principled and scalable solution for robust state estimation in sequential decision-making.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc0c1\ud0dc \ucd94\uc815\uc740 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc18c\uc74c\uacfc\uc758 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc804\ud658 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ub97c \ubc18\uc601\ud558\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc7a0\uc7ac \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uace0\ucc28\uc6d0, \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \ubc0f \ub178\uc774\uc988\uac00 \ub9ce\uc740 \uad00\uce21\uac12\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ud658\uacbd\uc758 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \ucd94\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc7a0\uc7ac \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uace0, \ub2e4\uc911 \uc13c\uc11c \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\ub97c \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud1b5\ud569\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \uc7a0\uc7ac \uc804\uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uac70\ub9ac \uac00\uc911 \uc13c\uc11c \uc735\ud569 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uacfc\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub098\uba70, \uc13c\uc11c \ub178\uc774\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac15\uc778\uc131\uc774 \uac1c\uc120\ub418\uace0 \uc0c1\ud0dc \ucd94\uc815\uc774 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc804\uc774 \uc778\uc2dd \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc5f0\uc18d\uc801 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uac15\uc778\ud55c \uc0c1\ud0dc \ucd94\uc815\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc6d0\uce59\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uace0\ucc28\uc6d0, \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ubc0f \uc7a1\uc74c\uc774 \ud3ec\ud568\ub41c \uad00\ucc30\uc5d0\uc11c \ud658\uacbd\uc758 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \ucd94\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8e8\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud655\ub960 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc885\uc885 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc778 \uc7a1\uc74c \uac00\uc815\uc744 \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud558\uc5ec \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\uc5d0 \uc81c\ud55c\uc744 \ub450\uac8c \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc0c1\ud0dc \uac04 \uac70\ub9ac\uac00 \uc774\ub97c \uc804\ud658\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ucd5c\uc18c \ud589\ub3d9 \uc218\uc640 \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uac16\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc7a0\uc7ac \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad \uacf5\uac04 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc778 \ud655\ub960 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \uc5c6\uc774 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \ud574\uc11d\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc13c\uc11c \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\uc758 \uc801\uc751\uc801 \ud1b5\ud569\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uac70\ub9ac \uac00\uc911 \uc13c\uc11c \uc735\ud569 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \uc7a0\uc7ac \uc804\uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec RL \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc2e4\uc99d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uc5ec \uc13c\uc11c \ub178\uc774\uc988\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac15\uc778\uc131\uc774 \uac1c\uc120\ub418\uace0 \uae30\uc900 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc0c1\ud0dc \ucd94\uc815\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc740 \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 RL \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\uc5c8\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc778 \uc7a1\uc74c \uc99d\uac00\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc74c\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc2dc\ub41c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc804\uc774 \uc778\uc2dd \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc5f0\uc18d\uc801 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\uc778\ud55c \uc0c1\ud0dc \ucd94\uc815\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc6d0\uce59\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc784\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, current LLM-based methods primarily follow either an Asset-Centric paradigm focused on individual stock prediction or a Market-Centric approach for portfolio allocation, often remaining agnostic to the underlying reasoning that drives market movements. In this paper, we propose a Logic-Oriented perspective, modeling the financial market as a dynamic, evolutionary ecosystem of competing investment narratives, termed Modes of Thought. To operationalize this view, we introduce MEME (Modeling the Evolutionary Modes of Financial Markets), designed to reconstruct market dynamics through the lens of evolving logics. MEME employs a multi-agent extraction module to transform noisy data into high-fidelity Investment Arguments and utilizes Gaussian Mixture Modeling to uncover latent consensus within a semantic space. To model semantic drift among different market conditions, we also implement a temporal evaluation and alignment mechanism to track the lifecycle and historical profitability of these modes. By prioritizing enduring market wisdom over transient anomalies, MEME ensures that portfolio construction is guided by robust reasoning. Extensive experiments on three heterogeneous Chinese stock pools from 2023 to 2025 demonstrate that MEME consistently outperforms seven SOTA baselines. Further ablation studies, sensitivity analysis, lifecycle case study and cost analysis validate MEME's capacity to identify and adapt to the evolving consensus of financial markets.

However, we contend that existing benchmarks exhibit common limitations in four dimensions: constrained data composition dominated by reused legacy sources, compromised data integrity lacking rigorous quality assurance, misaligned task formulations detached from real-world contexts, and rigid analysis perspectives that obscure generalizable insights. To bridge these gaps, we introduce TIME, a next-generation task-centric benchmark comprising 50 fresh datasets and 98 forecasting tasks, tailored for strict zero-shot TSFM evaluation free from data leakage. Integrating large language models and human expertise, we establish a rigorous human-in-the-loop benchmark construction pipeline to ensure high data integrity and redefine task formulation by aligning forecasting configurations with real-world operational requirements and variate predictability. Furthermore, we propose a novel pattern-level evaluation perspective that moves beyond traditional dataset-level evaluations based on static meta labels. By leveraging structural time series features to characterize intrinsic temporal properties, this approach offers generalizable insights into model capabilities across diverse patterns. We evaluate 12 representative TSFMs and establish a multi-granular leaderboard to facilitate in-depth analysis and visualized inspection.

Unlike prior static or synchronous evaluations, Gaia2 introduces scenarios where environments evolve independently of agent actions, requiring agents to operate under temporal constraints, adapt to noisy and dynamic events, resolve ambiguity, and collaborate with other agents. Each scenario is paired with a write-action verifier, enabling fine-grained, action-level evaluation and making Gaia2 directly usable for reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source models shows that no model dominates across capabilities: GPT-5 (high) reaches the strongest overall score of 42% pass@1 but fails on time-sensitive tasks, Claude-4 Sonnet trades accuracy and speed for cost, Kimi-K2 leads among open-source models with 21% pass@1. These results highlight fundamental trade-offs between reasoning, efficiency, robustness, and expose challenges in closing the \"sim2real\" gap. Gaia2 is built on a consumer environment with the open-source Agents Research Environments platform and designed to be easy to extend. By releasing Gaia2 alongside the foundational ARE framework, we aim to provide the community with a flexible infrastructure for developing, benchmarking, and training the next generation of practical agent systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Gaia2\ub294 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ube44\ub3d9\uae30\uc801\uc778 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc758 \ub3d9\uae30\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uacfc \ubb34\uad00\ud558\uac8c \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c4\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "Gaia2\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc81c\uc57d \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\uc5c5\ud558\uace0 \uc7a1\uc74c\uacfc \ub3d9\uc801 \uc0ac\uac74\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\ud558\uba70 \ubaa8\ud638\uc131\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0 \ub2e4\ub978 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \ud611\ub825\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4. \uac01 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub294 \ud589\ub3d9 \uac80\uc99d\uae30\uc640 \uc30d\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uacf5\ub418\uc5b4 \uc138\ubd84\ud654\ub41c \ud589\ub3d9 \uc218\uc900 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ucd5c\uc2e0 \uc0c1\uc6a9 \ubc0f \uc624\ud508\uc18c\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc5b4\ub5a4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub3c4 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ub2a5\ub825\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc704\ub97c \uc810\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud588\ub2e4.

This gap is primarily driven by RL's use of on-policy data. We propose a framework to bridge this chasm by enabling On-Policy SFT. We first present \\textbf{\\textit{Distribution Discriminant Theory (DDT)}}, which explains and quantifies the alignment between data and the model-induced distribution. Leveraging DDT, we introduce two complementary techniques: (i) \\textbf{\\textit{In-Distribution Finetuning (IDFT)}}, a loss-level method to enhance generalization ability of SFT, and (ii) \\textbf{\\textit{Hinted Decoding}}, a data-level technique that can re-align the training corpus to the model's distribution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves generalization performance on par with prominent offline RL algorithms, including DPO and SimPO, while maintaining the efficiency of an SFT pipeline.

While existing mixing methods show promise, they fall short when applied during real-world LM development. We present Olmix, a framework that addresses two such challenges. First, the configuration space for developing a mixing method is not well understood -- design choices across existing methods lack justification or consensus and overlook practical issues like data constraints. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study of this space, identifying which design choices lead to a strong mixing method. Second, in practice, the domain set evolves throughout LM development as datasets are added, removed, partitioned, and revised -- a problem setting largely unaddressed by existing works, which assume fixed domains. We study how to efficiently recompute the mixture after the domain set is updated, leveraging information from past mixtures. We introduce mixture reuse, a mechanism that reuses existing ratios and recomputes ratios only for domains affected by the update. Over a sequence of five domain-set updates mirroring real-world LM development, mixture reuse matches the performance of fully recomputing the mix after each update with 74% less compute and improves over training without mixing by 11.6% on downstream tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Olmix\ub294 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc2dc \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubbf9\uc2f1\uc758 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc640 \ud63c\ud569\ubb3c \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud6c8\ub828\uc5d0\uc11c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubbf9\uc2f1\uc740 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubbf9\uc2f1 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc801\uc6a9 \uc2dc \ud55c\uacc4\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "Olmix\ub294 \ubbf9\uc2f1 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \uc124\uacc4 \uc120\ud0dd\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0, \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc138\ud2b8\uac00 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub420 \ub54c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud63c\ud569\ubb3c\uc744 \uc7ac\uacc4\uc0b0\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub2e4\uc12f \ubc88\uc758 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc138\ud2b8 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud63c\ud569\ubb3c \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9\uc774 \uac01 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8 \ud6c4 \uc7ac\uacc4\uc0b0\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uacfc \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub0b4\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 74%\uc758 \uacc4\uc0b0\ub7c9\uc744 \uc808\uac10\ud558\uace0, \ub2e4\uc6b4\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9bc \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ube44\ubbf9\uc2f1 \ud6c8\ub828\ubcf4\ub2e4 11.6% \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub41c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Olmix\ub294 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud6c8\ub828 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubbf9\uc2f1 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubbf9\uc2f1 -

However, existing methods lack mechanisms to verify intermediate reasoning steps, allowing errors such as inapplicable statute citations to propagate undetected through the reasoning chain. To address this, we propose LawThinker, an autonomous legal research agent that adopts an Explore-Verify-Memorize strategy for dynamic judicial environments. The core idea is to enforce verification as an atomic operation after every knowledge exploration step. A DeepVerifier module examines each retrieval result along three dimensions of knowledge accuracy, fact-law relevance, and procedural compliance, with a memory module for cross-round knowledge reuse in long-horizon tasks. Experiments on the dynamic benchmark J1-EVAL show that LawThinker achieves a 24% improvement over direct reasoning and an 11% gain over workflow-based methods, with particularly strong improvements on process-oriented metrics. Evaluations on three static benchmarks further confirm its generalization capability.

This raises a natural question about operator choice: Mamba-2's state space recurrence is itself a form of iterative refinement, making it a natural candidate for recursive reasoning -- but does introducing Mamba-2 into the recursive scaffold preserve reasoning capability? We investigate this by replacing the Transformer blocks in TRM with Mamba-2 hybrid operators while maintaining parameter parity (6.83M vs 6.86M parameters). On ARC-AGI-1, we find that the hybrid improves pass@2 (the official metric) by +2.0\\% (45.88\\% vs 43.88\\%) and consistently outperforms at higher K values (+4.75\\% at pass@100), whilst maintaining pass@1 parity. This suggests improved candidate coverage -- the model generates correct solutions more reliably -- with similar top-1 selection. Our results validate that Mamba-2 hybrid operators preserve reasoning capability within the recursive scaffold, establishing SSM-based operators as viable candidates in the recursive operator design space and taking a first step towards understanding the best mixing strategies for recursive reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Mamba-2 \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc790\ub294 TRM\uc758 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30 \ube14\ub85d\uc744 \ub300\uccb4\ud558\uc5ec \uc7ac\uadc0\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc18c\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 \uc7ac\uadc0\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud558\ub294 \uc774\uc720\ub97c \uaddc\uba85\ud558\uace0, Mamba-2\uc758 \ub3c4\uc785\uc774 \uc774 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294\uc9c0 \ud655\uc778\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud568\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "TRM\uc758 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30 \ube14\ub85d\uc744 Mamba-2 \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc790\ub85c \uad50\uccb4\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "Mamba-2 \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc\uac00 ARC-AGI-1\uc5d0\uc11c pass@2\ub97c +2.0% \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf30\uace0, \ub192\uc740 K \uac12\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Mamba-2 \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc790\ub294 \uc7ac\uadc0\uc801 \uad6c\uc870 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud568\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uba70, \uc7ac\uadc0\uc801 \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc790 \uc124\uacc4\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4 SSM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc790\uc758 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc\uc758 \uc7ac\uadc0\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub378\uc778 TRM\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc791\uc740 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c(700\ub9cc \uac1c\uc758 \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130)\uac00 \uc911\uac04 \ud1a0\ud070\uc744 \ubc29\ucd9c\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc228\uaca8\uc9c4 \ud45c\ud604 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\uc81c\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ucd94\uc0c1\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc790 \uc120\ud0dd\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7ec\uc6b4 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \uc81c\uae30\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: Mamba-2\uc758 \uc0c1\ud0dc \uacf5\uac04 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc740 \uc2a4\uc2a4\ub85c \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \uc815\uc81c\uc758 \ud615\ud0dc\uc774\uba70, \uc7ac\uadc0\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc758 \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7ec\uc6b4 \ud6c4\ubcf4\uac00 \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 Mamba-2\ub97c \uc7ac\uadc0\uc801 \uad6c\uc870\uc5d0 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uba74 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \uc720\uc9c0\ub420\uae4c\uc694? \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 TRM\uc758 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30 \ube14\ub85d\uc744 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c Mamba-2 \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc790\ub85c \uad50\uccb4\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, traditional modal logic requires manual specification of relationship structures that are unknown or dynamic in real systems. This tutorial demonstrates differentiable modal logic (DML), implemented via Modal Logical Neural Networks (MLNNs), enabling systems to learn trust networks, causal chains, and regulatory boundaries from behavioral data alone.\n  We present a unified neurosymbolic debugging framework through four modalities: epistemic (who to trust), temporal (when events cause failures), deontic (what actions are permitted), and doxastic (how to interpret agent confidence). Each modality is demonstrated on concrete multi-agent scenarios, from discovering deceptive alliances in diplomacy games to detecting LLM hallucinations, with complete implementations showing how logical contradictions become learnable optimization objectives. Key contributions for the neurosymbolic community: (1) interpretable learned structures where trust and causality are explicit parameters, not opaque embeddings; (2) knowledge injection via differentiable axioms that guide learning with sparse data (3) compositional multi-modal reasoning that combines epistemic, temporal, and deontic constraints; and (4) practical deployment patterns for monitoring, active control and communication of multi-agent systems.

In the world of AI, while we possess the Pensieve-mature databases and retrieval systems, our models inexplicably lack the \"wand\" to operate it. They remain like a Dumbledore without agency, passively accepting a manually engineered context as their entire memory. This work finally places the wand in the model's hand. We introduce StateLM, a new class of foundation models endowed with an internal reasoning loop to manage their own state. We equip our model with a suite of memory tools, such as context pruning, document indexing, and note-taking, and train it to actively manage these tools. By learning to dynamically engineering its own context, our model breaks free from the architectural prison of a fixed window. Experiments across various model sizes demonstrate StateLM's effectiveness across diverse scenarios. On long-document QA tasks, StateLMs consistently outperform standard LLMs across all model scales; on the chat memory task, they achieve absolute accuracy improvements of 10% to 20% over standard LLMs. On the deep research task BrowseComp-Plus, the performance gap becomes even more pronounced: StateLM achieves up to 52% accuracy, whereas standard LLM counterparts struggle around 5%.

However, existing statistical methods struggle with pattern shifts, data sparsity, and lack of explanation, while pure LLM methods remain unreliable. We propose STAR, a framework that bridges data-driven STatistical expectations with knowledge-driven Agentic Reasoning. STAR leverages specialized retrievers to gather external knowledge and embeds semantic features into Constrained Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (CPMF) to generate statistical expectations with uncertainty. A reasoning module guided by Expectation Violation Theory (EVT) then refines predictions through intra-family analysis, cross-model comparison, and credibility-aware aggregation, producing adjustments with traceable explanations. Extensive experiments show that STAR consistently outperforms all baselines on both score-based and rank-based metrics, delivering a 14.46% gain in total score over the strongest statistical method under extreme sparsity, with only 1--2 observed scores per test model.", "AI": {"tldr": "STAR\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18 \ud1b5\uacc4 \uae30\ub300\uc640 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uae30\ubc18 \ud589\uc704 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\uba70, \ubaa8\ub378 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \ub300\ud615 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud3c9\uac00\uac00 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4dc\ub294 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uad00\uce21\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc608\uce21\uc774 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "STAR\ub294 \uc804\ubb38 \uac80\uc0c9\uae30\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc678\ubd80 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc218\uc9d1\ud558\uace0, \uc81c\uc57d\ub41c \ud655\ub960 \ud589\ub82c \ubd84\ud574(CPMF)\uc5d0 \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc801 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\uc2dc\ucf1c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \uae30\ub300\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "STAR\ub294 \uc810\uc218 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc0f \uc21c\uc704 \uae30\ubc18 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc744 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\uba70, \uadf9\ub3c4\uc758 \ud76c\uc18c\uc131 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uac00\uc7a5 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud1b5\uacc4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ucd1d \uc810\uc218\uac00 14.46% \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub41c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "STAR\ub294 1~2\uac1c\uc758 \uad00\ucc30 \uc810\uc218\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c\ub3c4 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc608\uce21 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \ub300\ud615 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud3c9\uac00\uac00 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4e4\uac8c \ub418\uba74\uc11c \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uad00\uce21\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774 \ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ud328\ud134 \ubcc0\ud654, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud76c\uc18c\uc131, \uc124\uba85 \ubd80\uc871 \ub4f1\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc21c\uc218\ud55c LLM \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \uae30\ub300\uc640 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ud589\uc704 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 STAR\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

Traditional compression techniques, such as dictionary-based and statistical methods, often struggle to optimally exploit the structure and redundancy in complex data formats. Recent advancements in deep learning have opened new avenues for compression; however, many existing approaches depend on dense vector representations that obscure the underlying token structure. To address these limitations, we propose a novel lossless compression method that leverages Reinforcement Learning applied to a T5 language model architecture. This approach enables the compression of data into sequences of tokens rather than traditional vector representations. Unlike auto-encoders, which typically encode information into continuous latent spaces, our method preserves the token-based structure, aligning more closely with the original data format. This preservation allows for higher compression ratios while maintaining semantic integrity. By training the model using an off-policy Reinforcement Learning algorithm, we optimize sequence length to minimize redundancy and enhance compression efficiency. Our method introduces an efficient and adaptive data compression system built upon advanced Reinforcement Learning techniques, functioning independently of external grammatical or world knowledge. This approach shows significant improvements in compression ratios compared to conventional methods. By leveraging the latent information within language models, our system effectively compresses data without requiring explicit content understanding, paving the way for more robust and practical

However, in scientific reasoning tasks, these models remain fragile due to unreliable solution evaluation and limited diversity in verification strategies. In this work, we propose Sci-CoE, a two-stage scientific co-evolving framework that enables models to self-evolve as both solver and verifier through a transition from sparse supervision to unsupervised learning. In the first stage, the model uses a small set of annotated data to establish fundamental correctness judgment anchors for the Verifier. In the second stage, we introduce a geometric reward mechanism that jointly considers consensus, reliability, and diversity, driving large-scale self-iteration on unlabeled data. Experiments on several general scientific benchmarks demonstrate that Sci-CoE enhances complex reasoning capabilities and exhibits strong scalability, facilitating the construction of more robust and diverse evaluation systems.

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising tools for symbolic equation discovery, owing to their broad domain knowledge and strong reasoning capabilities. However, most existing LLM-based systems try to guess equations directly from data, without modeling the multi-step reasoning process that scientists often follow: first inferring physical properties such as symmetries, then using these as priors to restrict the space of candidate equations. We introduce KeplerAgent, an agentic framework that explicitly follows this scientific reasoning process. The agent coordinates physics-based tools to extract intermediate structure and uses these results to configure symbolic regression engines such as PySINDy and PySR, including their function libraries and structural constraints. Across a suite of physical equation benchmarks, KeplerAgent achieves substantially higher symbolic accuracy and greater robustness to noisy data than both LLM and traditional baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "KeplerAgent\ub294 \ubb3c\ub9ac\ud559 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ucd94\ub860 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub530\ub974\ub294 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc2ec\ubcfc\ub9ad \ud68c\uadc0 \uc5d4\uc9c4\uc744 \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \ubb3c\ub9ac \ubc29\uc815\uc2dd\uc744 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \ucc3e\ub294\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uad00\ucc30\ub41c \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \uc0c1\uc9d5\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uacf5\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc124\uba85\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uacfc\ud559\uc758 \uae30\ubcf8 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \uc0c1\uc9d5\uc801 \ubc29\uc815\uc2dd \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c\ub85c \ub4f1\uc7a5\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "KeplerAgent\ub77c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub530\ub974\uba70, \ubb3c\ub9ac\ud559 \uae30\ubc18 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uc870\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \uc911\uac04 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc2ec\ubcfc\ub9ad \ud68c\uadc0 \uc5d4\uc9c4\uc744 \uad6c\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "KeplerAgent\ub294 \ubb3c\ub9ac \ubc29\uc815\uc2dd \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c LLM \ubc0f \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uae30\uc900\uc120\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \ub192\uc740 \uc2ec\ubcfc\ub9ad \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc640 \ub354 \ud070 \uc7a1\uc74c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac15\uc778\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ubc29\ud558\uc5ec LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ub2e8\uc810\uc744 \uadf9\ubcf5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uad00\ucc30\ub41c \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \uc0c1\uc9d5\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uacf5\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc124\uba85\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uacfc\ud559\uc758 \uae30\ubcf8 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \ud3ed\ub113\uc740 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uacfc \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825 \ub355\ubd84\uc5d0 \uc0c1\uc9d5\uc801 \ubc29\uc815\uc2dd \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c\ub85c \ubd80\uc0c1\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \uae30\uc874 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uacfc\ud559\uc790\ub4e4\uc774 \uc790\uc8fc \ub530\ub974\ub294 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ucd94\ub860 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c1\uc811 \ubc29\uc815\uc2dd\uc744 \ucd94\uce21\ud558\ub824\uace0 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uba3c\uc800 \ub300\uce6d\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc131\uc9c8\uc744 \ucd94\ub860\ud55c \ub2e4\uc74c \uc774\ub97c \uc0ac\uc804 \uc815\ubcf4\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud6c4\ubcf4 \ubc29\uc815\uc2dd \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub530\ub974\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 KeplerAgent\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ubb3c\ub9ac\ud559 \uae30\ubc18 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uc870\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \uc911\uac04 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec PySINDy \ubc0f PySR\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc2ec\ubcfc\ub9ad \ud68c\uadc0 \uc5d4\uc9c4\uc744 \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uace0, \ud568\uc218 \ub77c\uc774\ube0c\ub7ec\ub9ac \ubc0f \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc81c\uc57d\uc870\uac74\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubb3c\ub9ac \ubc29\uc815\uc2dd \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c KeplerAgent\ub294 LLM \ubc0f \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uae30\uc900\uc120\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \ub192\uc740 \uc2ec\ubcfc\ub9ad \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc640 \ub354 \ud070 \ub178\uc774\uc988 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac15\uc778\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, applying reinforcement learning to such settings remains difficult: realistic objectives often lack verifiable rewards and instead emphasize open-ended behaviors; moreover, RL for multi-turn, multi-step agentic tool use is still underexplored; and building and maintaining executable tool environments is costly, limiting scale and coverage. We propose CM2, an RL framework that replaces verifiable outcome rewards with checklist rewards. CM2 decomposes each turn's intended behavior into fine-grained binary criteria with explicit evidence grounding and structured metadata, turning open-ended judging into more stable classification-style decisions. To balance stability and informativeness, our method adopts a strategy of sparse reward assignment but dense evaluation criteria. Training is performed in a scalable LLM-simulated tool environment, avoiding heavy engineering for large tool sets. Experiments show that CM2 consistently improves over supervised fine-tuning. Starting from an 8B Base model and training on an 8k-example RL dataset, CM2 improves over the SFT counterpart by 8 points on tau^-Bench, by 10 points on BFCL-V4, and by 12 points on ToolSandbox. The results match or even outperform similarly sized open-source baselines, including the judging model. CM2 thus provides a scalable recipe for optimizing multi-turn, multi-step tool-using agents without relying on verifiable rewards.

In this work, we present CATTS, a simple technique for dynamically allocating compute for multi-step agents. We first conduct an empirical study of inference-time scaling for web agents. We find that uniformly increasing per-step compute quickly saturates in long-horizon environments. We then investigate stronger aggregation strategies, including an LLM-based Arbiter that can outperform naive voting, but that can overrule high-consensus decisions. We show that uncertainty statistics derived from the agent's own vote distribution (entropy and top-1/top-2 margin) correlate with downstream success and provide a practical signal for dynamic compute allocation. Based on these findings, we introduce Confidence-Aware Test-Time Scaling (CATTS), which uses vote-derived uncertainty to allocate compute only when decisions are genuinely contentious. CATTS improves performance on WebArena-Lite and GoBrowse by up to 9.1% over React while using up to 2.3x fewer tokens than uniform scaling, providing both efficiency gains and an interpretable decision rule.", "AI": {"tldr": "CATTS\ub294 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ub3d9\uc801 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ud560\ub2f9 \uae30\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6f9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uace0\uc548\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ucd5c\ub300 9.1% \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc778\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ubd84\ubc30 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ucc3e\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "\uc6f9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1\uc758 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc2e4\uc2dc\ud558\uace0, LLM \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc911\uc7ac\uc790\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc9d1\uacc4 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "CATTS\ub294 \uacb0\uc815\uc774 \uc9c4\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \ub17c\ub780\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uc5d0\ub9cc \uacc4\uc0b0\uc744 \ud560\ub2f9\ud558\uc5ec \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b4\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "CATTS\ub294 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \uc99d\uac00\uc640 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uacb0\uc815 \uaddc\uce59\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc5ec \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud45c\uc900\uc73c\ub85c \uc790\ub9ac\uc7a1\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1\uc740 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\ub294 \ud45c\uc900 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1\ud55c \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc740 \ub35c \uc774\ud574\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc791\uc740 \ub2e8\uacc4\ubcc4 \uc624\ub958\ub294 \uae34 \uc218\uba85 \uc8fc\uae30\uc5d0\uc11c \ub204\uc801\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uc744 \uade0\uc77c\ud558\uac8c \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \uc815\ucc45\uc740 \uc218\uc775\uc774 \uac10\uc18c\ud558\ub294 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 CATTS\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ub3d9\uc801 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ud560\ub2f9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \uae30\uc220\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uba3c\uc800 \uc6f9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1\uc758 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e8\uacc4\ubcc4 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc744 \uade0\uc77c\ud558\uac8c \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uae34 \uc218\uba85 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ube60\ub974\uac8c \ud3ec\ud654 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0 \uc774\ub978\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7f0 \ub2e4\uc74c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \ud22c\ud45c\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc6b0\uc218\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ub192\uc740 \ud569\uc758 \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ubb34\uc2dc\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc911\uc7ac\uc790\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ub354 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc9d1\uacc4 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc790\uccb4 \ud22c\ud45c \ubd84\ud3ec\uc5d0\uc11c \ud30c\uc0dd\ub41c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ud1b5\uacc4(\uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \ubc0f \uc0c1\uc704 1/\uc0c1\uc704 2 \ub9c8\uc9c4)\uac00 \ud558\ub958 \uc131\uacf5\uacfc \uc0c1\uad00\uc131\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uba70 \ub3d9\uc801 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ud560\ub2f9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c CATTS\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ud22c\ud45c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud30c\uc0dd\ub41c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uacb0\uc815\uc774 \uc9c4\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \ub17c\ub780\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uc5d0\ub9cc \uacc4\uc0b0\uc744 \ud560\ub2f9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.
