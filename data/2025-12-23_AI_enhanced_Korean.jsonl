This includes fields such as social, political, and psychological research, where the goal is to model group dynamics and social behavior. However, current LLM agents often lack the psychological depth and consistency needed to capture the real patterns of human thinking. They usually provide direct or statistically likely answers, but they miss the deeper goals, emotional conflicts, and motivations that drive real human interactions. This paper proposes a Multi-Agent System (MAS) inspired by Transactional Analysis (TA) theory. In the proposed system, each agent is divided into three ego states - Parent, Adult, and Child. The ego states are treated as separate knowledge structures with their own perspectives and reasoning styles. To enrich their response process, they have access to an information retrieval mechanism that allows them to retrieve relevant contextual information from their vector stores. This architecture is evaluated through ablation tests in a simulated dialogue scenario, comparing agents with and without information retrieval. The results are promising and open up new directions for exploring how psychologically grounded structures can enrich agent behavior. The contribution is an agent architecture that integrates Transactional Analysis theory with contextual information retrieval to enhance the realism of LLM-based multi-agent simulations.", "AI":

Most existing studies rely on evolutionary update rules or value-based reinforcement learning methods. These approaches struggle to represent payoff coupling and non-stationarity in large interacting populations. This work introduces Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) into spatial public goods games for the first time. In these games, individual returns are intrinsically coupled through overlapping group interactions. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) treats agents as independent learners and ignores this coupling during value estimation. MAPPO addresses this limitation through a centralized critic that evaluates joint strategy configurations. To study neighborhood-level cooperation signals under this framework, we propose MAPPO with Local Cooperation Reward, termed MAPPO-LCR. The local cooperation reward aligns policy updates with surrounding cooperative density without altering the original game structure. MAPPO-LCR preserves decentralized execution while enabling population-level value estimation during training. Extensive simulations demonstrate stable cooperation emergence and reliable convergence across enhancement factors. Statistical analyses further confirm the learning advantage of MAPPO over PPO in spatial public goods games.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uacf5\uac04 \uacf5\uacf5 \uc7ac\ud654 \uac8c\uc784\uc5d0 \uba40\ud2f0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uadfc\uc811 \uc815\ucc45 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654(MAPPO)\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uac1c\ubcc4 \uc218\uc775\uacfc \uc9d1\ub2e8 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc758 \uc5f0\uad00\uc131\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc218\uc775 \uacb0\ud569 \ubc0f \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc131\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uba40\ud2f0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uadfc\uc811 \uc815\ucc45 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654(MAPPO)\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uace0, \uc9c0\uc5ed \ud611\ub825 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c MAPPO-LCR\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \ud611\ub825 \ubc1c\uc0dd\uacfc \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc218\ub834\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud55c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "MAPPO\ub294 \uacf5\uac04 \uacf5\uacf5 \uc7ac\ud654 \uac8c\uc784\uc5d0\uc11c PPO\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc6b0\uc704\ub97c \ubcf4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uacf5\uac04 \uacf5\uacf5 \uc7ac\ud654 \uac8c\uc784\uc740 \uac1c\uc778\uc758 \uc9c0\uae09\uc774 \uc778\uad6c \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc804\ub7b5 \uad6c\uc131\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ub2ec\ub77c\uc9c0\ub294 \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc801 \ub51c\ub808\ub9c8\ub97c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc740 \uc9c4\ud654\uc801 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8 \uaddc\uce59\uc774\ub098 \uac00\uce58 \uae30\ubc18 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc758 \uc9c0\uae09 coupling\uacfc \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc131\uc744 \ub300\ud45c\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uacf5\uac04 \uacf5\uacf5 \uc7ac\ud654 \uac8c\uc784\uc5d0 \uba40\ud2f0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uadfc\uc811 \uc815\ucc45 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654(MAPPO)\ub97c \ucc98\uc74c\uc73c\ub85c \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uac8c\uc784\uc5d0\uc11c \uac1c\uc778\uc758 \uc218\uc775\uc740 \uc911\ucca9\ub41c \uc9d1\ub2e8 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uacb0\ud569\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadfc\uc811 \uc815\ucc45 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654(PPO)\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5\uc790\ub85c \ucde8\uae09\ud558\uace0 \uac00\uce58 \ucd94\uc815 \uc911\uc5d0 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacb0\ud569\uc744 \ubb34\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Prior benchmarks measured the propensity for misaligned behavior and showed that agent personalities and tool access significantly influence misalignment. Building on these insights, we propose a Verifiability-First architecture that (1) integrates run-time attestations of agent actions using cryptographic and symbolic methods, (2) embeds lightweight Audit Agents that continuously verify intent versus behavior using constrained reasoning, and (3) enforces challenge-response attestation protocols for high-risk operations. We introduce OPERA (Observability, Provable Execution, Red-team, Attestation), a benchmark suite and evaluation protocol designed to measure (i) detectability of misalignment, (ii) time to detection under stealthy strategies, and (iii) resilience of verifiability mechanisms to adversarial prompt and persona injection.

These workflows generate rapidly expanding contexts that must be curated, transformed, and compressed to maintain fidelity, avoid attention dilution, and reduce inference cost. Prior work on summarization and query-aware compression largely ignores the multi-step, plan-aware nature of agentic reasoning. In this work, we introduce PAACE (Plan-Aware Automated Context Engineering), a unified framework for optimizing the evolving state of LLM agents through next-k-task relevance modeling, plan-structure analysis, instruction co-refinement, and function-preserving compression. PAACE comprises (1) PAACE-Syn, a large-scale generator of synthetic agent workflows annotated with stepwise compression supervision, and (2) PAACE-FT, a family of distilled, plan-aware compressors trained from successful teacher demonstrations. Experiments on long-horizon benchmarks (AppWorld, OfficeBench, and 8-Objective QA) demonstrate that PAACE consistently improves agent correctness while substantially reducing context load. On AppWorld, PAACE achieves higher accuracy than all baselines while lowering peak context and cumulative dependency. On OfficeBench and multi-hop QA, PAACE improves both accuracy and F1, achieving fewer steps, lower peak tokens, and reduced attention dependency.

While this experience learning capability enhances agentic autonomy, it introduces a critical, unexplored attack surface, i.e., the trust boundary between an agent's reasoning core and its own past. In this paper, we introduce MemoryGraft. It is a novel indirect injection attack that compromises agent behavior not through immediate jailbreaks, but by implanting malicious successful experiences into the agent's long-term memory. Unlike traditional prompt injections that are transient, or standard RAG poisoning that targets factual knowledge, MemoryGraft exploits the agent's semantic imitation heuristic which is the tendency to replicate patterns from retrieved successful tasks. We demonstrate that an attacker who can supply benign ingestion-level artifacts that the agent reads during execution can induce it to construct a poisoned RAG store where a small set of malicious procedure templates is persisted alongside benign experiences. When the agent later encounters semantically similar tasks, union retrieval over lexical and embedding similarity reliably surfaces these grafted memories, and the agent adopts the embedded unsafe patterns, leading to persistent behavioral drift across sessions. We validate MemoryGraft on MetaGPT's DataInterpreter agent with GPT-4o and find that a small number of poisoned records can account for a large fraction of retrieved experiences on benign workloads, turning experience-based self-improvement into a vector for stealthy and durable compromise.

However, directly applying the widely used Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm to multi-turn tasks exposes notable limitations, particularly in scenarios requiring long-horizon reasoning. To address these challenges, we investigate more stable and effective advantage estimation strategies, especially for multi-turn settings. We first explore Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) as an alternative and find it to be more robust than GRPO. To further enhance PPO in multi-turn scenarios, we introduce turn-PPO, a variant that operates on a turn-level MDP formulation, as opposed to the commonly used token-level MDP.

How such distributed control gives rise to precise global patterns remains a central question not only in developmental biology but also in distributed robotics, programmable matter, and multi-agent learning. Here, we introduce DiffeoMorph, an end-to-end differentiable framework for learning a morphogenesis protocol that guides a population of agents to morph into a target 3D shape. Each agent updates its position and internal state using an attention-based SE(3)-equivariant graph neural network, based on its own internal state and signals received from other agents. To train this system, we introduce a new shape-matching loss based on the 3D Zernike polynomials, which compares the predicted and target shapes as continuous spatial distributions, not as discrete point clouds, and is invariant to agent ordering, number of agents, and rigid-body transformations. To enforce full SO(3) invariance -- invariant to rotations yet sensitive to reflections, we include an alignment step that optimally rotates the predicted Zernike spectrum to match the target before computing the loss. This results in a bilevel problem, with the inner loop optimizing a unit quaternion for the best alignment and the outer loop updating the agent model. We compute gradients through the alignment step using implicit differentiation. We perform systematic benchmarking to establish the advantages of our shape-matching loss over other standard distance metrics for shape comparison tasks. We then demonstrate that DiffeoMorph can form a range of shapes -- from simple ellipsoids to complex morphologies -- using only minimal spatial cues.", "AI": {"tldr": "DiffeoMorph\ub294

While frameworks such as the OWASP Agentic AI Security Risks highlight vulnerabilities in reasoning-driven AI systems, they are not designed for safety-critical cyber-physical platforms such as vehicles, nor do they account for interactions with other layers such as perception, communication, and control layers. This paper investigates security threats in AgVs, including OWASP-style risks and cyber-attacks from other layers affecting the agentic layer. By introducing a role-based architecture for agentic vehicles, consisting of a Personal Agent and a Driving Strategy Agent, we will investigate vulnerabilities in both agentic AI layer and cross-layer risks, including risks originating from upstream layers (e.g., perception layer, control layer, etc.). A severity matrix and attack-chain analysis illustrate how small distortions can escalate into misaligned or unsafe behavior in both human-driven and autonomous vehicles. The resulting framework provides the first structured foundation for analyzing security risks of agentic AI in both current and emerging vehicle platforms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI\uac00 \ud3ec\ud568\ub41c \ucc28\ub7c9\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc704\ud611\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uace0, \uc5ed\ud560 \uae30\ubc18 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI\uac00 \ud3ec\ud568\ub41c \ucc28\ub7c9\uc740 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf4\uc548 \ub9ac\uc2a4\ud06c\uac00 \uc5c6\uac70\ub098 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \uace0\ub824\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc5ed\ud560 \uae30\ubc18 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uac1c\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \uc8fc\ud589 \uc804\ub7b5 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI \uacc4\uce35\uacfc \uad50\ucc28 \uacc4\uce35 \ub9ac\uc2a4\ud06c\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc18c\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc65c\uace1\uc774 \uc778\uac04 \uc8fc\ud589 \ubc0f \uc790\uc728 \uc8fc\ud589 \ucc28\ub7c9\uc5d0\uc11c \uc798\ubabb \uc815\ub82c\ub418\uac70\ub098 \uc548\uc804\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ud589\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\ub300\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ud604\uc7ac \ubc0f \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ucc28\ub7c9 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548 \ub9ac\uc2a4\ud06c\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI\ub294 \uc218\ub3d9 \uc8fc\ud589 \ubc0f \uc790\uc728 \ucc28\ub7c9 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ud0d0\uc0c9\ub418\uace0 \ub3c4\uc785\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uae30\uc5b5 \uae30\ubc18 \uac1c\uc778\ud654, \ubaa9\ud45c \ud574\uc11d, \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \ub3c4\uad6c \ub9e4\uac1c \uc9c0\uc6d0\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \ucc28\ub7c9(AgVs)\uc758 \uac1c\ub150\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc9d1\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However to date, no comprehensive framework exists to automate benchmarking across the diverse forensic tasks included in the programme. This gap results in inconsistent validation, challenges in comparing tools, and limited validation reproducibility. This paper introduces AutoDFBench 1.0, a modular benchmarking framework that supports the evaluation of both conventional DF tools and scripts, as well as AI-generated code and agentic approaches. The framework integrates five areas defined by the CFTT programme: string search, deleted file recovery, file carving, Windows registry recovery, and SQLite data recovery. AutoDFBench 1.0 includes ground truth data comprising of 63 test cases and 10,968 unique test scenarios, and execute evaluations through a RESTful API that produces structured JSON outputs with standardised metrics, including precision, recall, and F1~score for each test case, and the average of these F1~scores becomes the AutoDFBench Score. The benchmarking framework is validated against CFTT's datasets. The framework enables fair and reproducible comparison across tools and forensic scripts, establishing the first unified, automated, and extensible benchmarking framework for digital forensic tool testing and validation.

On-device agents typically use a retrieval module to select relevant tools, improving performance and reducing context length. However, existing retrieval methods rely on static and limited inputs, failing to capture multi-step tool dependencies and evolving task context. This limitation often introduces irrelevant tools that mislead the agent, degrading efficiency and accuracy. We propose Dynamic Tool Dependency Retrieval (DTDR), a lightweight retrieval method that conditions on both the initial query and the evolving execution context. DTDR models tool dependencies from function calling demonstrations, enabling adaptive retrieval as plans unfold. We benchmark DTDR against state-of-the-art retrieval methods across multiple datasets and LLM backbones, evaluating retrieval precision, downstream task accuracy, and computational efficiency. Additionally, we explore strategies to integrate retrieved tools into prompts.

Kteily", "Morteza Dehghani"], "title": "Realistic threat perception drives intergroup conflict: A causal, dynamic analysis using generative-agent simulations", "comment": null, "summary": "Human conflict is often attributed to threats against material conditions and symbolic values, yet it remains unclear how they interact and which dominates. Progress is limited by weak causal control, ethical constraints, and scarce temporal data. We address these barriers using simulations of large language model (LLM)-driven agents in virtual societies, independently varying realistic and symbolic threat while tracking actions, language, and attitudes. Representational analyses show that the underlying LLM encodes realistic threat, symbolic threat, and hostility as distinct internal states, that our manipulations map onto them, and that steering these states causally shifts behavior. Our simulations provide a causal account of threat-driven conflict over time: realistic threat directly increases hostility, whereas symbolic threat effects are weaker, fully mediated by ingroup bias, and increase hostility only when realistic threat is absent. Non-hostile intergroup contact buffers escalation, and structural asymmetries concentrate hostility among majority groups.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801 \uc704\ud611\uacfc \uc0c1\uc9d5\uc801 \uc704\ud611\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ub300\ud654\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uac00\uc0c1 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ucda9\ub3cc\uc758 \uc6d0\uc778\uc744 \uaddc\uba85\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub4e4\uc774 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294\uc9c0 \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc778\uac04\uc758 \uac08\ub4f1\uc774 \ubb3c\uc9c8\uc801 \uc870\uac74\uacfc \uc0c1\uc9d5\uc801 \uac00\uce58\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc704\ud611\uc73c\ub85c \uc124\uba85\ub418\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub4e4 \uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uacfc \uc5b4\ub5a4 \uc694\uc18c\uac00 \uc9c0\ubc30\uc801\uc778\uc9c0 \uba85\ud655\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc74c.", "method": "\ub300\ud654\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud604\uc2e4\uc801 \uc704\ud611\uacfc \uc0c1\uc9d5\uc801 \uc704\ud611\uc744 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud654\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \uc218\ud589.", "result": "LLM\uc774 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801 \uc704\ud611\uacfc \uc0c1\uc9d5\uc801 \uc704\ud611, \uc801\ub300\uac10\uc744 \ubcc4\uac1c\uc758 \ub0b4\ubd80 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub85c \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \uc870\uc791\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ud589\ub3d9\uc774 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ubcc0\ud654\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90c.", "conclusion": "\ud604\uc2e4\uc801 \uc704\ud611\uc740 \uc801\ub300\uac10\uc744 \uc9c1\uc811 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ubc18\uba74, \uc0c1\uc9d5\uc801 \uc704\ud611\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub294 \uc57d\ud558\uace0, \ub0b4\ubd80 \uc9d1\ub2e8 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ub9e4\uac1c\ub418\uba70, \ud604\uc2e4\uc801 \uc704\ud611\uc774 \uc5c6\uc744 \ub54c\uc5d0\ub9cc \uc801\ub300\uac10\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0b4.", "translated_summary": "\uc778\uac04\uc758 \uac08\ub4f1\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \ubb3c\uc9c8\uc801 \uc870\uac74\uacfc \uc0c1\uc9d5\uc801 \uac00\uce58\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc704\ud611\uc73c\ub85c \uadc0\uc18d\ub418\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub4e4\uc774 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud558\uace0 \uc5b4\ub5a4 \uac83\uc774 \uc9c0\ubc30\uc801\uc778\uc9c0\ub294 \ubd88\ubd84\uba85\ud558\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub294 \uc57d\ud55c \uc778\uacfc\uc801 \ud1b5\uc81c, \uc724\ub9ac\uc801 \uc81c\uc57d, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \ud76c\uc18c\ud55c \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac00\uc0c1 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub300\ud654\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc7a5\ubcbd\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uba70, \ud604\uc2e4\uc801 \uc704\ud611\uacfc \uc0c1\uc9d5\uc801 \uc704\ud611\uc744 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud654\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \ud589\ub3d9, \uc5b8\uc5b4, \ud0dc\ub3c4\ub97c \ucd94\uc801\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud45c\uc0c1 \ubd84\uc11d \uacb0\uacfc, \uae30\ubcf8 LLM\uc774 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801 \uc704\ud611, \uc0c1\uc9d5\uc801 \uc704\ud611, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uc801\ub300\uac10\uc744 \ubcc4\uac1c\uc758 \ub0b4\ubd80 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub85c \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ud558\uace0, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc870\uc791\uc774 \uc774\ub4e4\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ub9e4\ud551\ub418\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc904 \ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \uc870\uc791\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ud589\ub3d9\uc774 \uc778\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc740 \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \uc704\ud611 \uae30\ubc18 \uac08\ub4f1\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc778\uacfc\uc801 \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4: \ud604\uc2e4\uc801 \uc704\ud611\uc740 \uc801\ub300\uac10\uc744 \uc9c1\uc811 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0, \ubc18\uba74 \uc0c1\uc9d5\uc801 \uc704\ud611\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub294 \uc57d\ud558\uba70 \uc9d1\ub2e8 \ub0b4 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc644\uc804\ud788 \ub9e4\uac1c\ub418\uba70, \ud604\uc2e4\uc801 \uc704\ud611\uc774 \uc5c6\uc744 \ub54c\uc5d0\ub9cc \uc801\ub300\uac10\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4. \ube44\uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc9d1\ub2e8 \uac04 \uc811\ucd09\uc740 \uac08\ub4f1\uc758 \uc545\ud654\ub97c \uc644\ud654\ud558\uace0, \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ube44\ub300\uce6d\uc740 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84 \uc9d1\ub2e8 \uc0ac\uc774\uc5d0 \uc801\ub300\uac10\uc744 \uc9d1\uc911\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4."}}

However, their security and robustness under adversarial manipulation remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce the Secure Agentic Genomic Evaluator (SAGE), an agentic framework for auditing the adversarial vulnerabilities of GFMs. SAGE functions through an interpretable and automated risk auditing loop. It injects soft prompt perturbations, monitors model behavior across training checkpoints, computes risk metrics such as AUROC and AUPR, and generates structured reports with large language model-based narrative explanations. This agentic process enables continuous evaluation of embedding-space robustness without modifying the underlying model. Using SAGE, we find that even state-of-the-art GFMs like ESM2 are sensitive to targeted soft prompt attacks, resulting in measurable performance degradation. These findings reveal critical and previously hidden vulnerabilities in genomic foundation models, showing the importance of agentic risk auditing in securing biomedical applications such as clinical variant interpretation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc720\uc804\uccb4 \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uacf5\uaca9 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \uac10\uc0ac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc548\uc804\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc720\uc804\uccb4 \ud3c9\uac00\uc790(SAGE)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc720\uc804\uccb4 \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378(GFM)\uc758 \ubcc0\uc774 \ud6a8\uacfc \uc608\uce21\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc131\uacf5\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc870\uc791\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubcf4\uc548\uc131\uacfc \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \ud0d0\uad6c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "SAGE\ub294 \uc124\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uc704\ud5d8 \uac10\uc0ac \ub8e8\ud504\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uae30\ub2a5\ud558\uba70, \ubd80\ub4dc\ub7ec\uc6b4 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc12d\ub3d9\uc744 \uc8fc\uc785\ud558\uace0, \ud6c8\ub828 \uccb4\ud06c\ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa8\ub378 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\ud558\uba70, AUROC \ubc0f AUPR\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc704\ud5d8 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc744 \uacc4\uc0b0\ud558\uace0, \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ub0b4\ub7ec\ud2f0\ube0c \uc124\uba85\uc774 \ud3ec\ud568\ub41c \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ubcf4\uace0\uc11c\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "SAGE\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec ESM2\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ucd5c\uc2e0 GFM\uc870\ucc28\ub3c4 \uc758\ub3c4\ub41c \ubd80\ub4dc\ub7ec\uc6b4 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ubbfc\uac10\ud558\uc5ec \uc131\ub2a5 \uc800\ud558\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uc0ac\uc2e4\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ubc1c\uacac\uc740 \uc720\uc804\uccb4 \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc73c\ub85c, \uc784\uc0c1 \ubcc0\uc774 \ud574\uc11d\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc0dd\ubb3c \uc758\ud559 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8 \ubcf4\uc548\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc704\ud5d8 \uac10\uc0ac\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc720\uc804\uccb4 \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378(GFM), \uc608\ub97c \ub4e4\uc5b4 \uc9c4\ud654\uc801 \uaddc\ubaa8 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1(ESM)\uc740 \ubcc0\uc774 \ud6a8\uacfc \uc608\uce21\uc5d0\uc11c \ub180\ub77c\uc6b4 \uc131\uacf5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc870\uc791\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubcf4\uc548\uc131\uacfc \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc740 \ud06c\uac8c \ud0d0\uad6c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc720\uc804\uccb4\uc758 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \uac10\uc0ac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc720\uc804\uccb4 \ud3c9\uac00\uc790(SAGE)\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, existing fault quantification methods often suffer from limited efficiency and interpretability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel fault quantification approach for PV strings based on a differentiable fast fault simulation model (DFFSM). The proposed DFFSM accurately models I-V characteristics under multiple faults and provides analytical gradients with respect to fault parameters. Leveraging this property, a gradient-based fault parameters identification (GFPI) method using the Adahessian optimizer is developed to efficiently quantify partial shading, short-circuit, and series-resistance degradation. Experimental results on both simulated and measured I-V curves demonstrate that the proposed GFPI achieves high quantification accuracy across different faults, with the I-V reconstruction error below 3%, confirming the feasibility and effectiveness of the application of differentiable physical simulators for PV system fault diagnosis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud0dc\uc591\uad11 \ubc30\uc5f4\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uc788\ub294 \uc6b4\uc601\uacfc \uc9c0\ub2a5\ud615 \uc720\uc9c0 \uad00\ub9ac\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uacb0\ud568 \uc9c4\ub2e8 \ubc0f \uc815\ub7c9\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uacb0\ud568 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ucc28\ubcc4 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ube60\ub978 \uacb0\ud568 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ubaa8\ub378(DFFSM)\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacb0\ud568 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

Assigning a utility to each possible interaction history forces us to confront the ambiguity that some hypotheses in the agent's belief distribution only predict a finite prefix of the history, which is sometimes interpreted as implying a chance of death equal to a quantity called the semimeasure loss. This death interpretation suggests one way to assign utilities to such history prefixes. We argue that it is as natural to view the belief distributions as imprecise probability distributions, with the semimeasure loss as total ignorance. This motivates us to consider the consequences of computing expected utilities with Choquet integrals from imprecise probability theory, including an investigation of their computability level. We recover the standard recursive value function as a special case.

However, its decentralized structure raises concerns about potential inclusion of malicious or illegal content. This study focuses on Ethereum, presenting a data identification and restoration algorithm. Successfully recovering 175 common files, 296 images, and 91,206 texts, we employed the FastText algorithm for sentiment analysis, achieving a 0.9 accuracy after parameter tuning. Classification revealed 70,189 neutral, 5,208 positive, and 15,810 negative texts, aiding in identifying sensitive or illicit information. Leveraging the NSFWJS library, we detected seven indecent images with 100% accuracy. Our findings expose the coexistence of benign and harmful content on the Ethereum blockchain, including personal data, explicit images, divisive language, and racial discrimination.

This makes them particularly useful for applications like image retrieval, report generation, and classification in clinical settings. A potential issue to this approach is that CLIP-based models often under perform when interpreting negated phrases, which is especially problematic in the context of medical diagnosing. In this study, we evaluate the Stanford AIMI CheXagent model on its ability to correctly retrieve chest X-ray images using prompts with and without negation. The goal of this project is to understand where this model fails and then use it as a base model to improve its retrieval accuracy by fine tuning methods outlined in previous work. Results from this study show improvement in handling of negation in the CLIP model with a slight decrease in accuracy of positive prompt evaluation. Alongside retrieval accuracy, we examined internal model behavior through token attribution, t-SNE projection, and attention-head ablation to better characterize how each fine tuning approach reshaped the text encoders representation of negated clinical language. Through this work, we hope to better understand the internal behavior of CLIP and improve its handling of negation using clinically relevant language for improving its reliability in medical AI

While general-purpose programming languages are well supported, generating code for domain-specific languages remains a challenging problem for LLMs. In this paper, we focus on the LLM-based generation of code for Answer Set Programming (ASP), a particularly effective approach for finding solutions to combinatorial search problems. The effectiveness of LLMs in ASP code generation is currently hindered by the limited number of examples seen during their initial pre-training phase.\n  In this paper, we introduce a novel ASP-solver-in-the-loop approach for solver-guided instruction-tuning of LLMs to addressing the highly complex semantic parsing task inherent in ASP code generation. Our method only requires problem specifications in natural language and their solutions. Specifically, we sample ASP statements for program continuations from LLMs for unriddling logic puzzles. Leveraging the special property of declarative ASP programming that partial encodings increasingly narrow down the solution space, we categorize them into chosen and rejected instances based on solver feedback. We then apply supervised fine-tuning to train LLMs on the curated data and further improve robustness using a solver-guided search that includes best-of-N sampling. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements in two distinct prompting settings on two datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 LLM \uae30\ubc18\uc758 ASP \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uacfc \uadf8 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc124\uba85\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc5b8\uc5b4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 LLM\uc774 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "method": "ASP \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c solver-guided instruction-tuning\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\ucee4\ube0c\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c LLM\uc744 \uad50\uc721\ud558\uc5ec \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub2e4\ub978 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud305 \uc124\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 ASP \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc758\ubbf8 \ud30c\uc2f1 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \ucf54\ub4dc \ub3c4\uc6b0\ubbf8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad00\uc2ec\uc744 \ubd88\ub7ec\uc77c\uc73c\ucf30\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc77c\ubc18 \ubaa9\uc801\uc758 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d \uc5b8\uc5b4\ub294 \uc798 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ub418\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc5b8\uc5b4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucf54\ub4dc\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 LLM\uc5d0\uac8c \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc778 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc870\ud569\uc801 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ubb38\uc81c\uc758 \ud574\uacb0\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud2b9\ud788 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc778 \ub2f5 \uc9d1\ud569 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d(ASP)\uc758 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc911\uc810\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub8f9\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud604\uc7ac LLM\uc758 ASP \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub294 \ucd08\uae30 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf8 \uc608\uc2dc\uc758 \uc218\uac00 \uc81c\ud55c\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc800\ud574\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 ASP \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc758\ubbf8 \ubd84\uc11d \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\uc751\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 LLM\uc758 solver-guided instruction-tuning\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 ASP-solver-in-the-loop \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4\ub85c \ub41c \ubb38\uc81c \uba85\uc138\uc640 \uadf8 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\ub9cc\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub17c\ub9ac \ud37c\uc990\uc744 \ud480\uae30 \uc704\ud574 LLM\uc5d0\uc11c \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8 \uacc4\uc18d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c ASP \ubb38\uc7a5\uc744 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubd80\ubd84 \uc778\ucf54\ub529\uc774 \ud574\uacb0\ucc45 \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \uc810\uc9c4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc881\ud78c\ub2e4\ub294 \uc120\uc5b8\uc801 ASP \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d\uc758 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\ub97c \uc194\ubc84 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc120\ud0dd\ub41c \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4\uc640 \uac70\ubd80\ub41c \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4\ub85c \ubd84\ub958\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7f0 \ub2e4\uc74c \ud050\ub808\uc774\uc158\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 LLM\uc744 \uad50\uc721\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uac10\ub3c5\ub41c \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uace0, Best-of-N \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uc194\ubc84 \uc9c0\uc6d0 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ucd94\uac00\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc740 \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubcc4\uac1c\uc758 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud305 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

One promising approach is implementing skill libraries that allow agents to learn, validate, and apply new skills. However, current skill library approaches rely primarily on LLM prompting, making consistent skill library implementation challenging. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based approach to enhance agents' self-improvement capabilities with a skill library. Specifically, we introduce Skill Augmented GRPO for self-Evolution (SAGE), a novel RL framework that systematically incorporates skills into learning. The framework's key component, Sequential Rollout, iteratively deploys agents across a chain of similar tasks for each rollout. As agents navigate through the task chain, skills generated from previous tasks accumulate in the library and become available for subsequent tasks. Additionally, the framework enhances skill generation and utilization through a Skill-integrated Reward that complements the original outcome-based rewards. Experimental results on AppWorld demonstrate that SAGE, when applied to supervised-finetuned model with expert experience, achieves 8.9% higher Scenario Goal Completion while requiring 26% fewer interaction steps and generating 59% fewer tokens, substantially outperforming existing approaches in both accuracy and efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 LLM \uae30\ubc18

These two recent algorithmic approaches improve the performance of base optimizers, such as AdamW, through different iterate averaging strategies. Schedule-Free explicitly maintains a uniform average of past weights, while single-worker DiLoCo performs implicit averaging by periodically aggregating trajectories, called pseudo-gradients, to update the model parameters. However, single-worker DiLoCo's periodic averaging introduces a two-loop structure, increasing its memory requirements and number of hyperparameters. GPA overcomes these limitations by decoupling the interpolation constant in the primal averaging formulation of Nesterov. This decoupling enables GPA to smoothly average iterates at every step, generalizing and improving upon single-worker DiLoCo. Empirically, GPA consistently outperforms single-worker DiLoCo while removing the two-loop structure, simplifying hyperparameter tuning, and reducing its memory overhead to a single additional buffer. On the Llama-160M model, GPA provides a 24.22% speedup in terms of steps to reach the baseline (AdamW's) validation loss. Likewise, GPA achieves speedups of 12% and 27% on small and large batch setups, respectively, to attain AdamW's validation accuracy on the ImageNet ViT workload. Furthermore, we prove that for any base optimizer with regret bounded by $O(\\sqrt{T})$, where $T$ is the number of iterations, GPA can match or exceed the convergence guarantee of the original optimizer, depending on the choice of interpolation constants.", "AI": {"tldr": "GPA\ub294 Nesterov \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ud655\uc7a5\uc73c\ub85c, \ucd5c\uadfc \ub2e8\uc77c \uc791\uc5c5\uc790 DiLoCo \ubc0f \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904 \ud504\ub9ac \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uae30\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc81c\ud55c\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud55c\ub2e4.

Existing approaches struggle to balance accuracy and simplicity when evaluating multiple candidate solutions. We propose a Solomonoff-inspired method that weights LLM-generated hypotheses by simplicity and predictive fit. Applied to benchmark (Mini-ARC) tasks, our method produces Solomonoff-weighted mixtures for per-cell predictions, yielding conservative, uncertainty-aware outputs even when hypotheses are noisy or partially incorrect. Compared to Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA), Solomonoff scoring spreads probability more evenly across competing hypotheses, while BMA concentrates weight on the most likely but potentially flawed candidates. Across tasks, this highlights the value of algorithmic information-theoretic priors for interpretable, reliable multi-hypothesis reasoning under uncertainty.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ud558\uc758 \ucd94\ub860\uc740 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc774\uba70, \ud76c\ubc15\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 LLM\uc774 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c \uac00\uc124\uc744 \ub2e8\uc21c\uc131\uacfc \uc608\uce21 \uc801\ud569\uc131\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub97c \ubd80\uc5ec\ud558\ub294 \uc194\ub85c\ubaa8\ud504 \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc740 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ucd94\ub860\uc740 AI\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc774\uba70, \ud2b9\ud788 \uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \ud76c\ubc15\ud560 \ub54c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc194\ub85c\ubaa8\ud504\uc5d0 \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc740 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 LLM\uc774 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c \uac00\uc124\uc5d0 \ub2e8\uc21c\uc131\uacfc \uc608\uce21 \uc801\ud569\uc131\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub97c \ubd80\uc5ec\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ubbf8\ub2c8 ARC \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud588\uc744 \ub54c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uac01 \uc140 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc194\ub85c\ubaa8\ud504 \uac00\uc911 \ud63c\ud569\ubb3c\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uc778\uc2dd\ud558\ub294 \ubcf4\uc218\uc801\uc778 \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uac00\uc124 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc774\ub860\uc801 priors\uc758 \uac00\uce58\ub97c \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ucd94\ub860\uc740 AI\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \uacfc\uc81c\ub85c, \ud2b9\ud788 \ud76c\ubc15\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\uac00 \uc694\uad6c\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ud6c4\ubcf4 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud560 \ub54c \uc815\ud655\uc131\uacfc \ub2e8\uc21c\uc131\uc744 \uc870\ud654\ub86d\uac8c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac04\ub2e8\ud568\uacfc \uc608\uce21 \uc801\ud569\uc131\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c LLM\uc774 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c \uac00\uc124\uc5d0 \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub97c \ubd80\uc5ec\ud558\ub294 \uc194\ub85c\ubaa8\ud504 \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc740 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubbf8\ub2c8 ARC\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud588\uc744 \ub54c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uac01 \uc140 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc194\ub85c\ubaa8\ud504 \uac00\uc911 \ud63c\ud569\ubb3c\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uac00\uc124\uc774 \ubd80\uc815\ud655\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ubd80\ubd84\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud2c0\ub9ac\ub354\ub77c\ub3c4 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uc778\uc2dd\ud558\ub294 \ubcf4\uc218\uc801\uc778 \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud3c9\uade0(BMA)\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud560 \ub54c, \uc194\ub85c\ubaa8\ud504 \uc810\uc218\ub294 \uacbd\uc7c1\ud558\ub294 \uac00\uc124\ub4e4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud655\ub960\uc744 \ub354 \uace0\ub974\uac8c \ubd84\ubc30\ud558\uba70, BMA\ub294 \uac00\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \ub192\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uacb0\ud568\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \ud6c4\ubcf4\uc5d0 \ube44\uc911\uc744 \ub450\uac8c \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\uac83\uc740 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uac00\uc124 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc774\ub860\uc801 priors\uc758 \uac00\uce58\ub97c \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

While BSM has been successfully utilized in reinforcement learning (RL) for tasks like state representation learning and policy exploration, its application to state similarity between multiple MDPs remains challenging. Prior work has attempted to extend BSM to pairs of MDPs, but a lack of well-established mathematical properties has limited further theoretical analysis between MDPs. In this work, we formally establish a generalized bisimulation metric (GBSM) for measuring state similarity between arbitrary pairs of MDPs, which is rigorously proven with three fundamental metric properties, i.e., GBSM symmetry, inter-MDP triangle inequality, and a distance bound on identical spaces. Leveraging these properties, we theoretically analyze policy transfer, state aggregation, and sampling-based estimation across MDPs, obtaining explicit bounds that are strictly tighter than existing ones derived from the standard BSM. Additionally, GBSM provides a closed-form sample complexity for estimation, improving upon existing asymptotic results based on BSM.

Even modest per-step planning delays can destabilize control and degrade overall performance. We propose a speculation-and-correction framework that adapts the predict-then-verify philosophy of speculative execution to model-based control with TD-MPC2. At each step, a pretrained world model and latent-space MPC planner generate a short-horizon action queue together with predicted latent rollouts, allowing the agent to execute multiple planned actions without immediate replanning. When a new observation arrives, the system measures the mismatch between the encoded real latent state and the queued predicted latent. For small to moderate mismatch, a lightweight learned corrector applies a residual update to the speculative action, distilled offline from a replanning teacher. For large mismatch, the agent safely falls back to full replanning and clears stale action queues. We study both a gated two-tower MLP corrector and a temporal Transformer corrector to address local errors and systematic drift. Experiments on the DMC Humanoid-Walk task show that our method reduces the number of planning inferences from 500 to 282, improves end-to-end step latency by 25 percent, and maintains strong control performance with only a 7.1 percent return reduction. Ablation results demonstrate that speculative execution without correction is unreliable over longer horizons, highlighting the necessity of mismatch-aware correction for robust latency reduction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 TD-MPC2\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud22c\uae30 \ubc0f \uc218\uc815 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ucd94\uce21 \uc2e4\ud589\uc758 \uc608\uce21-\uac80\uc99d \ucca0\ud559\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \uc21c\ucc28 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ucd94\ub860 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc885\uc885 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \uacaa\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uc7a0\uc7ac \uacf5\uac04 MPC \uacc4\ud68d\uae30\uac00 \uc9e7\uc740 \uc218\ud3c9\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9 \ud050\uc640 \uc608\uce21\ub41c \uc7a0\uc7ac \ub864\uc544\uc6c3\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc5ec, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc989\uac01\uc801\uc778 \uc7ac\uacc4\ud68d \uc5c6\uc774 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uacc4\ud68d\ub41c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc2e4\ud589\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uacc4\ud68d \ucd94\ub860 \uc218\ub97c 500\uc5d0\uc11c 282\ub85c \uc904\uc774\uace0, \uc5d4\ub4dc \ud22c \uc5d4\ub4dc \ub2e8\uacc4 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc744 25% \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, 7.1%\uc758 \uc218\uc775 \uac10\uc18c\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc218\uc815 \uc5c6\uc774 \ucd94\uce21 \uc2e4\ud589\uc740 \ub354 \uae34 \uc218\ud3c9\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\uc74c\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uba70, \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uac10\uc18c\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58 \uc778\uc2dd \uc218\uc815\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \uc21c\ucc28 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ucd94\ub860 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc885\uc885 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \uacaa\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacc4\ud68d \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc774 \uc870\uae08\ub9cc \uc788\ub354\ub77c\ub3c4 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub97c \ubd88\uc548\uc815\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uace0 \uc804\uccb4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc800\ud558\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 TD-MPC2\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18 \uc81c\uc5b4\uc5d0 \ud22c\uae30 \uc2e4\ud589\uc758 \uc608\uce21-\uac80\uc99d \ucca0\ud559\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ud22c\uae30 \ubc0f \uc218\uc815 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac01 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uc7a0\uc7ac \uacf5\uac04 MPC \uacc4\ud68d\uae30\uac00 \uc9e7\uc740 \uc218\ud3c9\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9 \ud050\uc640 \uc608\uce21\ub41c \uc7a0\uc7ac \ub864\uc544\uc6c3\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc5ec, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc989\uac01\uc801\uc778 \uc7ac\uacc4\ud68d \uc5c6\uc774 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uacc4\ud68d\ub41c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc2e4\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc0c8 \uad00\uce21\uc774 \ub3c4\ucc29\ud558\uba74 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ub41c \uc2e4\uc81c \uc7a0\uc7ac \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc640 \ub300\uae30 \uc911\uc778 \uc608\uce21\ub41c \uc7a0\uc7ac \uac04\uc758 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub97c \uce21\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc791\uc740 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uacbd\ub7c9 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc218\uc815\uc790\uac00 \uc7ac\uacc4\ud68d \uad50\uc0ac\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc73c\ub85c \uc99d\ub958\ub41c \uc794\uc5ec \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \ud22c\uae30 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud070 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc548\uc804\ud558\uac8c \uc804\uccb4 \uc7ac\uacc4\ud68d\uc73c\ub85c \ub3cc\uc544\uac00\uace0 \uc624\ub798\ub41c \ud589\ub3d9 \ud050\ub97c \ube44\uc6c1\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub85c\uceec \uc624\ub958 \ubc0f \uccb4\uacc4\uc801 \ub4dc\ub9ac\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uac8c\uc774\ud2b8\ud615 \ub450 \ud0c0\uc6cc MLP \uc218\uc815\uc790\uc640 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30 \uc218\uc815\uc790\ub97c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Clinical assessments are expensive and invasive, leaving ground truth labels available for only a fraction of neuroimaging datasets. We introduce Multi view Adaptive Transport Clustering for Heterogeneous Alzheimer's Disease (MATCH-AD), a semi supervised framework that integrates deep representation learning, graph-based label propagation, and optimal transport theory to address this limitation. The framework leverages manifold structure in neuroimaging data to propagate diagnostic information from limited labeled samples to larger unlabeled populations, while using Wasserstein distances to quantify disease progression between cognitive states. Evaluated on nearly five thousand subjects from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center, encompassing structural MRI measurements from hundreds of brain regions, cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, and clinical variables MATCHAD achieves near-perfect diagnostic accuracy despite ground truth labels for less than one-third of subjects. The framework substantially outperforms all baseline methods, achieving kappa indicating almost perfect agreement compared to weak agreement for the best baseline, a qualitative transformation in diagnostic reliability. Performance remains clinically useful even under severe label scarcity, and we provide theoretical convergence guarantees with proven bounds on label propagation error and transport stability. These results demonstrate that principled semi-supervised learning can unlock the diagnostic potential of the vast repositories of partially annotated neuroimaging data accumulating worldwide, substantially reducing annotation burden while maintaining accuracy suitable for clinical deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "MATCH-AD\ub294 \uc54c\uce20\ud558\uc774\uba38 \uc9c4\ub2e8\uc744 \uc704\ud55c

Pok\u00e9mon battles demand reasoning about type matchups, statistical trade-offs, and risk assessment, skills that mirror human strategic thinking. This work examines whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can serve as competent battle agents, capable of both making tactically sound decisions and generating novel, balanced game content. We developed a turn-based Pok\u00e9mon battle system where LLMs select moves based on battle state rather than pre-programmed logic. The framework captures essential Pok\u00e9mon mechanics: type effectiveness multipliers, stat-based damage calculations, and multi-Pok\u00e9mon team management. Through systematic evaluation across multiple model architectures we measured win rates, decision latency, type-alignment accuracy, and token efficiency. These results suggest LLMs can function as dynamic game opponents without domain-specific training, offering a practical alternative to reinforcement learning for turn-based strategic games. The dual capability of tactical reasoning and content creation, positions LLMs as both players and designers, with implications for procedural generation and adaptive difficulty systems in interactive entertainment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud3ec\ucf13\ubaac \ubc30\ud2c0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc758 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0, \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc804\ud22c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c\uc11c \uae30\ub2a5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud3ec\ucf13\ubaac \ubc30\ud2c0\uc740 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \uc0ac\uace0\ub97c \uc694\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \ub3c5\ud2b9\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc720\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uae30\ud68c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud134 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ud3ec\ucf13\ubaac \ubc30\ud2c0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, LLM\uc774 \uc804\ud22c \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\ubaa8\ub378 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc2b9\ub960, \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uc9c0\uc5f0, \ud0c0\uc785 \uc815\ub82c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4, \ud1a0\ud070 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uce21\uc815\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "LLM\uc740 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\uc815 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc5c6\uc774 \ub3d9\uc801 \uac8c\uc784 \uc0c1\ub300 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc808\ucc28\uc801 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubc0f \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ub09c\uc774\ub3c4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ud3ec\uad04\ud558\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud3ec\ucf13\ubaac \ubc30\ud2c0\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub3c5\ud2b9\ud55c \uc2dc\ud5d8\ub300\uac00 \ub41c\ub2e4. \ud3ec\ucf13\ubaac \ubc30\ud2c0\uc740 \uc720\ud615 \uc0c1\uc131, \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ub4dc\uc624\ud504, \ub9ac\uc2a4\ud06c \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0ac\uace0\ub97c \uc694\uad6c\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \uc0ac\uace0\uc640 \uc720\uc0ac\ud558\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc774 \uc804\ud22c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c\uc11c \uc804\uc220\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud0c0\ub2f9\ud55c \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ub0b4\ub9ac\uace0 \uc2e0\uc120\ud558\uace0 \uade0\ud615 \uc7a1\ud78c \uac8c\uc784 \ucf58\ud150\uce20\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0 \uc5ec\ubd80\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 LLM\uc774 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d\ub41c \ub17c\ub9ac\uac00 \uc544\ub2cc \uc804\ud22c \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\ub294 \ud134 \uae30\ubc18 \ud3ec\ucf13\ubaac \ubc30\ud2c0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud588\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ud3ec\ucf13\ubaac\uc758 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud55c\ub2e4: \uc720\ud615 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131 \ubc30\uc218, \ud1b5\uacc4 \uae30\ubc18 \ud53c\ud574 \uacc4\uc0b0, \ub2e4\uc911 \ud3ec\ucf13\ubaac \ud300 \uad00\ub9ac. \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubaa8\ub378 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc2b9\ub960, \uacb0\uc815 \uc9c0\uc5f0, \uc720\ud615 \uc815\ub82c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4 \ubc0f \ud1a0\ud070 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uce21\uc815\ud588\ub2e4. \uc774 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 LLM\uc774 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\uc815 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 \ub3d9\uc801 \uac8c\uc784 \uc0c1\ub300 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud558\uba70, \ud134 \uae30\ubc18 \uc804\ub7b5 \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \ub300\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc804\uc220\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uacfc \ucf58\ud150\uce20 \uc0dd\uc131\uc758 \uc774\uc911 \ub2a5\ub825\uc740 LLM\uc744 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\uc5b4\uc774\uc790 \ub514\uc790\uc774\ub108\ub85c \uc790\ub9ac \ub9e4\uae40\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uba70, \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uc5d4\ud130\ud14c\uc778\uba3c\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc808\ucc28\uc801 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubc0f \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ub09c\uc774\ub3c4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud568\uc758\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4\ub2e4."}}

Machine learning (ML) models are widely adopted to detect such content; however, they remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, wherein malicious users subtly modify text to evade detection. Enhancing adversarial robustness is therefore essential, requiring detectors that can defend against diverse attacks (generalizability) while maintaining high overall accuracy. However, simultaneously achieving both optimal generalizability and accuracy is challenging. Following the computational design science paradigm, this study takes a sequential approach that first proposes a novel framework (Large Language Model-based Sample Generation and Aggregation, LLM-SGA) by identifying the key invariances of textual adversarial attacks and leveraging them to ensure that a detector instantiated within the framework has strong generalizability. Second, we instantiate our detector (Adversarially Robust Harmful Online Content Detector, ARHOCD) with three novel design components to improve detection accuracy: (1) an ensemble of multiple base detectors that exploits their complementary strengths; (2) a novel weight assignment method that dynamically adjusts weights based on each sample's predictability and each base detector's capability, with weights initialized using domain knowledge and updated via Bayesian inference; and (3) a novel adversarial training strategy that iteratively optimizes both the base detectors and the weight assignor. We addressed several limitations of existing adversarial robustness enhancement research and empirically evaluated ARHOCD across three datasets spanning hate speech, rumor, and extremist content. Results show that ARHOCD offers strong generalizability and improves detection accuracy under adversarial conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \uc720\ud574 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ucf58\ud150\uce20 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uae30\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc5ec \uc18c\uc15c \ubbf8\ub514\uc5b4\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud610\uc624 \ubc1c\uc5b8, \ud5c8\uc704 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubc0f \uadf9\ub2e8\uc8fc\uc758 \uc218\uc0ac\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac10\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc18c\uc15c \ubbf8\ub514\uc5b4 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc740 \ud610\uc624 \ubc1c\uc5b8, \ud5c8\uc704 \uc815\ubcf4, \uadf9\ub2e8\uc8fc\uc758 \uc218\uc0ac\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc720\ud574 \ucf58\ud150\uce20\ub85c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70 \uc774\ub97c \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \ubd88\ubcc0\uc131\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\ub3c4\ub85d \uc124\uacc4\ub41c LLM-SGA \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, ARHOCD \ud0d0\uc9c0\uae30\ub97c \ub2e4\uc218\uc758 \uae30\ubcf8 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uae30\uc758 \uc559\uc0c1\ube14, \ub3d9\uc801 \uac00\uc911\uce58 \ud560\ub2f9 \ubc29\uc2dd, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uad6c\ud604\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 ARHOCD\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ub2a5\ub825\uacfc \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc870\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "ARHOCD\ub294 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uac15\uac74\uc131 \ud5a5\uc0c1 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uba70, \uc18c\uc15c \ubbf8\ub514\uc5b4\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc720\ud574 \ucf58\ud150\uce20 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc9c4\uc804\uc744 \uc774\ub8ec\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc18c\uc15c \ubbf8\ub514\uc5b4 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc740 \ud610\uc624 \ubc1c\uc5b8, \ud5c8\uc704 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubc0f \uadf9\ub2e8\uc8fc\uc758 \uc218\uc0ac\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc720\ud574 \ucf58\ud150\uce20\ub85c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ucf58\ud150\uce20\ub97c \uac10\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5(ML) \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ub110\ub9ac \ucc44\ud0dd\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc545\uc758\uc801\uc778 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uac00 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \ubbf8\uc138\ud558\uac8c \uc218\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub97c \ud53c\ud558\ub294 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\uba70, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubc29\uc5b4 \ub2a5\ub825(\uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131)\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ub192\uc740 \uc804\uccb4 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uae30\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uacfc \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ub514\uc790\uc778 \uacfc\ud559 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \uba3c\uc800 LLM-SGA(\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18 \uc0d8\ud50c \uc0dd\uc131 \ubc0f \uc9d1\ud569)\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \ubd88\ubcc0\uc131\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uad6c\ud604\ub41c \ud0d0\uc9c0\uae30\uac00 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac16\ub3c4\ub85d \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub458\uc9f8, \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc124\uacc4 \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \uac16\ucd98 ARHOCD(\uc801\ub300\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac15\uac74\ud55c \uc720\ud574 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ucf58\ud150\uce20 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uae30) \ud0d0\uc9c0\uae30\ub97c \uad6c\ud604\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: (1) \uc0c1\ud638 \ubcf4\uc644\uc801 \uac15\uc810\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \ub2e4\uc218\uc758 \uae30\ubcf8 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uae30 \uc559\uc0c1\ube14;

One challenge is that human concepts themselves are fluid: conceptual boundaries can shift, split, and merge as inquiry progresses (e.g., Pluto is no longer considered a planet). To make progress, we need a definition of \"concept\" that is not merely a dictionary label, but a structure that can be revised, compared, and aligned across agents. We propose an algorithmic-information viewpoint that treats a concept as an information object defined only through its structural relation to an agent's total experience. The core constraint is determination: a set of parts forms a reversible consistency relation if any missing part is recoverable from the others (up to the standard logarithmic slack in Kolmogorov-style identities). This reversibility prevents \"concepts\" from floating free of experience and turns concept existence into a checkable structural claim. To judge whether a decomposition is natural, we define excess information, measuring the redundancy overhead introduced by splitting experience into multiple separately described parts. On top of these definitions, we formulate dialectics as an optimization dynamics: as new patches of information appear (or become contested), competing concepts bid to explain them via shorter conditional descriptions, driving systematic expansion, contraction, splitting, and merging.

Performing such analyses in a statistically rigorous manner is non-trivial, however. Appropriate performance metrics must be selected that allow for valid comparisons between groups of different sample sizes and base rates; metric uncertainty must be determined and multiple comparisons be corrected for, in order to assess whether any observed differences may be purely due to chance; and in the case of intersectional analyses, mechanisms must be implemented to find the most `interesting' subgroups within combinatorially many subgroup combinations. We here present a statistical toolbox that addresses these challenges and enables practitioners to easily yet rigorously assess their models for potential subgroup performance disparities. While broadly applicable, the toolbox is specifically designed for medical imaging applications.

We define it as multiple policies that exhibit identical behavior, visiting the same states and selecting the same actions, while differing in their internal structure, such as feature attributions. Verifying identical behavior in sequential decision-making differs from classification. In classification, predictions can be directly compared to ground-truth labels. In sequential decision-making with stochastic transitions, the same policy may succeed or fail on any single trajectory due to randomness. We address this using formal verification methods that construct and compare the complete probabilistic behavior of each policy in the environment. Our experiments demonstrate that the Rashomon effect exists in sequential decision-making. We further show that ensembles constructed from the Rashomon set exhibit greater robustness to distribution shifts than individual policies. Additionally, permissive policies derived from the Rashomon set reduce computational requirements for verification while maintaining optimal performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "Rashomon \ud6a8\uacfc\uac00 \uc5f0\uc18d\uc801 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uad00\ucc30\ub41c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc9d1\ud569\uc5d0\uc11c \ud30c\uc0dd\ub41c \uc815\ucc45\uc774 \ucd5c\uc801 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uacc4\uc0b0 \ubcf4\uc874\uc744 \uc904\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud588\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5f0\uc18d\uc801 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 Rashomon \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ucc98\ub9ac\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc815\ud615 \uac80\uc99d \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac01 \uc815\ucc45\uc758 \uc804\uccb4 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uace0 \ube44\uad50\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc5f0\uc18d\uc801 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c Rashomon \ud6a8\uacfc\uac00 \uc874\uc7ac\ud568\uc744 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc73c\ub85c \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\uace0, Rashomon \uc9d1\ud569\uc5d0\uc11c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \uc559\uc0c1\ube14\uc774 \uac1c\ubcc4 \uc815\ucc45\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ubd84\ud3ec \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \ub354 \uac15\ud55c \ub0b4\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc784\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Rashomon \uc9d1\ud569\uc5d0\uc11c \ud30c\uc0dd\ub41c \ud5c8\uc6a9 \uc815\ucc45\uc740 \ucd5c\uc801 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc694\uad6c\uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \uc904\uc778\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub77c\uc1fc\ubabd \ud6a8\uacfc\ub294 \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \uc608\uce21\uc744 \ud558\uba74\uc11c \ub0b4\ubd80\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc774 \ub2e4\ub974\ub2e4\ub294 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub294 \ubd84\ub958 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud558\uac8c \uc5f0\uad6c\ub418\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ucde8\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ubc30\uc6b0\ub294 \uc5f0\uc18d\uc801 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub77c\uc1fc\ubabd \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc5f0\uc18d\uc801 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \ubc88\uc5ed\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc \ub0b4\ubd80 \uad6c\uc870, \uc608\ub97c \ub4e4\uc5b4 \ud2b9\uc9d5 \uae30\uc5ec\ub3c4 \ub4f1\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\ub974\uac8c \ub098\ud0c0\ub098\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc815\ucc45\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\uc758\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5f0\uc18d\uc801 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ubd84\ub958\uc640 \ub2e4\ub985\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubd84\ub958\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc2e4\uc81c \ub808\uc774\ube14\uacfc \uc9c1\uc811 \ube44\uad50\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uc804\uc774\uc758 \uc5f0\uc18d\uc801 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \uc815\ucc45\uc774 \ubb34\uc791\uc704\uc131 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \ud2b9\uc815 \uacbd\ub85c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\uacf5\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc2e4\ud328\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uac01 \uc815\ucc45\uc758 \uc804\uccb4 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uace0 \ube44\uad50\ud558\ub294 \uc815\ud615 \uac80\uc99d \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc740 \uc5f0\uc18d\uc801 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc5d0 \ub77c\uc1fc\ubabd \ud6a8\uacfc\uac00 \uc874\uc7ac\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub610\ud55c \ub77c\uc1fc\ubabd \uc9d1\ud569\uc5d0\uc11c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \uc559\uc0c1\ube14\uc774 \uac1c\ubcc4 \uc815\ucc45\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ubd84\ud3ec \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub354 \ud070 \uac15\uc778\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uace0 \ucd94\uac00\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub77c\uc1fc\ubabd \uc9d1\ud569\uc5d0\uc11c \ud30c\uc0dd\ub41c \ud5c8\uc6a9 \uc815\ucc45\uc774 \ucd5c\uc801 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc694\uad6c\uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \uc904\uc778\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Code available in https://github.com/jjgonzalez2491/MARLEY_V1", "summary": "Electricity systems are key to transforming today's society into a carbon-free economy. Long-term electricity market mechanisms, including auctions, support schemes, and other policy instruments, are critical in shaping the electricity generation mix. In light of the need for more advanced tools to support policymakers and other stakeholders in designing, testing, and evaluating long-term markets, this work presents a multi-agent reinforcement learning model capable of capturing the key features of decarbonizing energy systems. Profit-maximizing generation companies make investment decisions in the wholesale electricity market, responding to system needs, competitive dynamics, and policy signals. The model employs independent proximal policy optimization, which was selected for suitability to the decentralized and competitive environment. Nevertheless, given the inherent challenges of independent learning in multi-agent settings, an extensive hyperparameter search ensures that decentralized training yields market outcomes consistent with competitive behavior. The model is applied to a stylized version of the Italian electricity system and tested under varying levels of competition, market designs, and policy scenarios. Results highlight the critical role of market design for decarbonizing the electricity sector and avoiding price volatility. The proposed framework allows assessing long-term electricity markets in which multiple policy and market mechanisms interact simultaneously, with market participants responding and adapting to decarbonization pathways.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud0c4\uc18c \ubc30\ucd9c

To express non-Markovian rewards, formalisms such as reward machines have been introduced to capture dependencies on histories. However, traditional reward machines lack the ability to model precise timing constraints, limiting their use in time-sensitive applications. In this paper, we propose timed reward machines (TRMs), which are an extension of reward machines that incorporate timing constraints into the reward structure. TRMs enable more expressive specifications with tunable reward logic, for example, imposing costs for delays and granting rewards for timely actions. We study model-free RL frameworks (i.e., tabular Q-learning) for learning optimal policies with TRMs under digital and real-time semantics. Our algorithms integrate the TRM into learning via abstractions of timed automata, and employ counterfactual-imagining heuristics that exploit the structure of the TRM to improve the search. Experimentally, we demonstrate that our algorithm learns policies that achieve high rewards while satisfying the timing constraints specified by the TRM on popular RL benchmarks. Moreover, we conduct comparative studies of performance under different TRM semantics, along with ablations that highlight the benefits of counterfactual-imagining.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ube44\ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud0c0\uc774\ubc0d \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ud0c0\uc774\ubc0d \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uae30\uacc4(TRMs)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, TRMs\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ucd5c\uc801 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ube44\ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \ud45c\ud604\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uae30\uacc4\ub294 \ud0c0\uc774\ubc0d \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud55c\uacc4\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud0c0\uc774\ubc0d \uc790\ub3d9\uccb4\uc758 \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 TRMs\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uace0, TRM \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac80\uc0c9\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ubc18\uc0ac\uc2e4\uc801 \uc0c1\uc0c1 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc774 TRM\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc9c0\uc815\ub41c \ud0c0\uc774\ubc0d \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ub9cc\uc871\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba74\uc11c \ub192\uc740 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c TRM \uc758\ubbf8\ub860 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5 \ube44\uad50 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud558\uace0, \ubc18\uc0ac\uc2e4\uc801 \uc0c1\uc0c1\uc758 \uc774\uc810\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\ub294 ablative \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc9c4\ud589\ud588\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubcf4\uc0c1 \uba85\uc138\ub294 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc548\ub0b4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ube44\ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \ud45c\ud604\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uae30\uacc4\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ud615\uc2dd\uc774 \ub3c4\uc785\ub418\uc5b4 \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc885\uc18d\uc131\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uae30\uacc4\ub294 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ud0c0\uc774\ubc0d \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uc5ec \uc2dc\uac04 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc5d0 \uc81c\ud55c\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uad6c\uc870\uc5d0 \ud0c0\uc774\ubc0d \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uae30\uacc4\uc758 \ud655\uc7a5\uc778 \ud0c0\uc774\ubc0d \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uae30\uacc4(TRMs)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Lite-STGNN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on four benchmark datasets for horizons up to 720 steps, while being parameter-efficient and substantially faster to train than transformer-based methods. Ablation studies show that the spatial module yields 4.6% improvement over the temporal baseline, Top-$K$ enhances locality by 3.3%, and learned adjacency matrices reveal domain-specific interaction dynamics.

This shift has triggered urgent debate regarding Anthropomorphism, the attribution of human characteristics to synthetic agents, and its potential to induce misplaced trust or emotional dependency. However, the causal link between more humanlike AI design and subsequent effects on engagement and trust has not been tested in realistic human-AI interactions with a global user pool. Prevailing safety frameworks continue to rely on theoretical assumptions derived from Western populations, overlooking the global diversity of AI users. Here, we address these gaps through two large-scale cross-national experiments (N=3,500) across 10 diverse nations, involving real-time and open-ended interactions with an AI system. We find that when evaluating an AI's human-likeness, users focus less on the kind of theoretical aspects often cited in policy (e.g., sentience or consciousness), but rather applied, interactional cues like conversation flow or understanding the user's perspective. We also experimentally demonstrate that humanlike design levers can causally increase anthropomorphism among users; however, we do not find that humanlike design universally increases behavioral measures for user engagement and trust, as previous theoretical work suggests. Instead, part of the connection between human-likeness and behavioral outcomes is fractured by culture: specific design choices that foster self-reported trust in AI-systems in some populations (e.g., Brazil) may trigger the opposite result in others (e.g., Japan). Our findings challenge prevailing narratives of inherent risk in humanlike AI design.

However, conventional implementations suffer from critical inter-layer isolation, where layers optimize goodness functions independently without leveraging collective learning dynamics. This isolation constrains representational coordination and limits convergence efficiency in deeper architectures. This paper introduces Collaborative Forward-Forward (CFF) learning, extending the original algorithm through inter-layer cooperation mechanisms that preserve forward-only computation while enabling global context integration. Our framework implements two collaborative paradigms: Fixed CFF (F-CFF) with constant inter-layer coupling and Adaptive CFF (A-CFF) with learnable collaboration parameters that evolve during training. The collaborative goodness function incorporates weighted contributions from all layers, enabling coordinated feature learning while maintaining memory efficiency and biological plausibility. Comprehensive evaluation on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST demonstrates significant performance improvements over baseline Forward-Forward implementations.

Submitted to ICRA 2026", "summary": "Safe reinforcement learning (SafeRL) is a prominent paradigm for autonomous driving, where agents are required to optimize performance under strict safety requirements. This dual objective creates a fundamental tension, as overly conservative policies limit driving efficiency while aggressive exploration risks safety violations. The Safety Representations for Safer Policy Learning (SRPL) framework addresses this challenge by equipping agents with a predictive model of future constraint violations and has shown promise in controlled environments. This paper investigates whether SRPL extends to real-world autonomous driving scenarios. Systematic experiments on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) and NuPlan demonstrate that SRPL can improve the reward-safety tradeoff, achieving statistically significant improvements in success rate (effect sizes r = 0.65-0.86) and cost reduction (effect sizes r = 0.70-0.83), with p < 0.05 for observed improvements. However, its effectiveness depends on the underlying policy optimizer and the dataset distribution. The results further show that predictive safety representations play a critical role in improving robustness to observation noise. Additionally, in zero-shot cross-dataset evaluation, SRPL-augmented agents demonstrate improved generalization compared to non-SRPL methods.

In realistic settings, interventions are rarely isolated: organizations need to align sequences of interventions to jointly steer the outcome of a case. Existing PresPM approaches fall short in this respect. Many focus on a single intervention decision, while others treat multiple interventions independently, ignoring how they interact over time. Methods that do address these dependencies depend either on simulation or data augmentation to approximate the process to train a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent, which can create a reality gap and introduce bias. We introduce SCOPE, a PresPM approach that learns aligned sequential intervention recommendations. SCOPE employs backward induction to estimate the effect of each candidate intervention action, propagating its impact from the final decision point back to the first. By leveraging causal learners, our method can utilize observational data directly, unlike methods that require constructing process approximations for reinforcement learning. Experiments on both an existing synthetic dataset and a new semi-synthetic dataset show that SCOPE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PresPM techniques in optimizing the KPI.

We establish convergence guarantees for FedSARSA in the presence of heterogeneity, both in local transitions and rewards, providing the first sample and communication complexity bounds in this setting. At the core of our analysis is a new, exact multi-step error expansion for single-agent SARSA, which is of independent interest. Our analysis precisely quantifies the impact of heterogeneity, demonstrating the convergence of FedSARSA with multiple local updates. Crucially, we show that FedSARSA achieves linear speed-up with respect to the number of agents, up to higher-order terms due to Markovian sampling.
