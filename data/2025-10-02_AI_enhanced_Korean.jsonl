The model integrates census and municipal data, drone-derived elevation\nmodels, GIS road networks, and survey-based caregiving information to generate\nsynthetic populations of older adults and their caregivers. Agents are\norganized into dyads with socio-economic and mobility attributes, enabling the\nsimulation of both micro-scale accessibility and meso-scale caregiving\noutcomes. Two scenarios are compared: a baseline and an alternative involving\nthe relocation of healthcare services. Key indicators include caregiver effort,\noverwhelmed caregivers, walkability, and unmet hours of care. Findings show\nthat while relocation improves walkability locally, it increases unmet care\nhours due to detours and reduced proximity. Household income emerges as the\nprimary driver of caregiver burden, with accessibility shaped by interactions\nbetween financial and mobility resources. Results highlight the need for\ninterventions tailored to context-specific constraints in remote ageing\ncommunities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc774\ud0c8\ub9ac\uc544 \ud504\ub808\uba54\ub178 \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c \ub178\uc778 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc758 \uc811\uadfc\uc131\uacfc \ub3cc\ubd04 \uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub178\uc778 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc758 \uc811\uadfc\uc131\uacfc \ub3cc\ubd04 \uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uc5ec \uc6d0\uac70\ub9ac \ub178\uc778 \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ud2f0\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ub9de\ucda4\ud615 \uac1c\uc785\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud568.", "method": "\uc778\uad6c\uc870\uc0ac \ubc0f \uc9c0\ubc29 \uc790\uce58 \uccb4\uacc4 \ub370\uc774\ud130, \ub4dc\ub860 \uae30\ubc18 \uace0\ub3c4 \ubaa8\ub378, GIS \ub3c4\ub85c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ubc0f \uc870\uc0ac \uae30\ubc18 \ub3cc\ubd04 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ub178\uc778 \ubc0f \ub3cc\ubcf4\ubbf8\uc758 \ud569\uc131 \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud588\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uc7ac\ubc30\uce58\uac00 \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\ud589\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc6b0\ud68c \ubc0f \uadfc\uc811\uc131 \uac10\uc18c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ub3cc\ubd04 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \ucda9\uc871\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uac8c \ub41c\ub2e4\ub294 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uac00\uacc4 \uc18c\ub4dd\uc774 \ub3cc\ubcf4\ubbf8 \ubd80\ub2f4\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc694\uc778\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\uc73c\uba70, \uc811\uadfc\uc131\uc740 \uc7ac\uc815 \ubc0f \uc774\ub3d9 \uc790\uc6d0 \uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ud615\uc131\ub41c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc774\ud0c8\ub9ac\uc544 \ud504\ub808\uba54\ub178(VB) \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc758 \ub178\uc778 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc758 \uc811\uadfc\uc131\uacfc \ub3cc\ubd04 \uc5ed\ud559\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc778\uad6c \uc870\uc0ac \ubc0f \uc9c0\ubc29 \uc790\uce58 \uccb4\uacc4 \ub370\uc774\ud130, \ub4dc\ub860\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5bb\uc740 \uace0\ub3c4 \ubaa8\ub378, GIS \ub3c4\ub85c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ubc0f \uc870\uc0ac \uae30\ubc18 \ub3cc\ubd04 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ub178\uc778\uacfc \uadf8 \ub3cc\ubcf4\ubbf8\uc758 \ud569\uc131 \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc0ac\ud68c \uacbd\uc81c\uc801 \ubc0f \uc774\ub3d9\uc131 \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \uc30d\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub418\uc5b4 \ubbf8\uc2dc\uc801 \uc811\uadfc\uc131\uacfc \uc911\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub3cc\ubd04 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub97c \ube44\uad50\ud55c\ub2e4: \uae30\ubcf8\uc120 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc640 \uc758\ub8cc \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uc774\ub3d9\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ub300\uc548 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624. \uc8fc\uc694 \uc9c0\ud45c\uc5d0\ub294 \ub3cc\ubcf4\ubbf8\uc758 \ub178\ub825, \uc555\ub3c4\ub41c \ub3cc\ubcf4\ubbf8, \ubcf4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \ubc0f \ucda9\uc871\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ub3cc\ubd04 \uc2dc\uac04\uc774 \ud3ec\ud568\ub41c\ub2e4. \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc7ac\ubc30\uce58\uac00 \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\ud589\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc6b0\ud68c \ubc0f \uac10\uc18c\ub41c \uadfc\uc811\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ucda9\uc871\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ub3cc\ubd04 \uc2dc\uac04\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \uac00\uacc4 \uc18c\ub4dd\uc774 \ub3cc\ubcf4\ubbf8 \ubd80\ub2f4\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc694\uc778\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\uc73c\uba70, \uc811\uadfc\uc131\uc740 \uc7ac\uc815 \ubc0f \uc774\ub3d9 \uc790\uc6d0\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ud615\uc131\ub41c\ub2e4. \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc6d0\uac70\ub9ac \ub178\uc778 \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ud2f0\uc758 \ub9e5\ub77d \ud2b9\ud654\ub41c \uc81c\uc548\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

This paper seeks to re-examine the risk evaluation\nparadigm by introducing a theoretical framework that reconstructs the\nunderlying risk concept space. Specifically, we decompose the latent risk\nconcept space into three mutually exclusive subspaces: the explicit risk\nsubspace (encompassing direct violations of safety guidelines), the implicit\nrisk subspace (capturing potential malicious content that requires contextual\nreasoning for identification), and the non-risk subspace. Furthermore, we\npropose RADAR, a multi-agent collaborative evaluation framework that leverages\nmulti-round debate mechanisms through four specialized complementary roles and\nemploys dynamic update mechanisms to achieve self-evolution of risk concept\ndistributions. This approach enables comprehensive coverage of both explicit\nand implicit risks while mitigating evaluator bias. To validate the\neffectiveness of our framework, we construct an evaluation dataset comprising\n800 challenging cases. Extensive experiments on our challenging testset and\npublic benchmarks demonstrate that RADAR significantly outperforms baseline\nevaluation methods across multiple dimensions, including accuracy, stability,\nand self-evaluation risk sensitivity. Notably, RADAR achieves a 28.87%\nimprovement in risk identification accuracy compared to the strongest baseline\nevaluation method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub300\ud615

However, as long-term memory context grows over time, they\nstruggle to maintain coherence. This deficiency leads to critical failures,\nincluding identity drift, ignoring established beliefs, and the propagation of\nhallucinations in multi-agent systems. To mitigate these challenges, this paper\nintroduces Identity Retrieval-Augmented Generation (ID-RAG), a novel mechanism\ndesigned to ground an agent's persona and persistent preferences in a dynamic,\nstructured identity model: a knowledge graph of core beliefs, traits, and\nvalues. During the agent's decision loop, this model is queried to retrieve\nrelevant identity context, which directly informs action selection. We\ndemonstrate this approach by introducing and implementing a new class of ID-RAG\nenabled agents called Human-AI Agents (HAis), where the identity model is\ninspired by the Chronicle structure used in Perspective-Aware AI, a dynamic\nknowledge graph learned from a real-world entity's digital footprint. In social\nsimulations of a mayoral election, HAis using ID-RAG outperformed baseline\nagents in long-horizon persona coherence - achieving higher identity recall\nacross all tested models by the fourth timestep - and reduced simulation\nconvergence time by 19% (GPT-4o) and 58% (GPT-4o mini). By treating identity as\nan explicit, retrievable knowledge structure, ID-RAG offers a foundational\napproach for developing more temporally coherent, interpretable, and aligned\ngenerative agents.

While the input modality\n(photographs) is well within the training distribution of modern multimodal\nmodels, the task of spatial reconstruction requires genuine spatial\nintelligence: inferring room layouts, understanding connectivity, and\nmaintaining consistent scale. We evaluate leading language models (GPT-5,\nClaude 4 Opus, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Grok-4), image generation models (GPT-Image,\nNanoBanana), and agent systems (Codex CLI, Claude Code) on a dataset of 50\napartments with approximately 20 interior images each. Our scoring algorithm\nmeasures similarity between generated and ground-truth floor plans based on\nroom connectivity graphs and size rankings. Results reveal a significant blind\nspot in current AI capabilities: most models perform at or below a random\nbaseline, while human performance remains substantially superior. Image\ngeneration models particularly struggle with instruction following, while\nagent-based approaches with iterative refinement capabilities show no\nmeaningful improvement over single-pass generation. Blueprint-Bench provides\nthe first numerical framework for comparing spatial intelligence across\ndifferent model architectures.

Among these concerns, the self-replication risk of LLM agents\ndriven by objective misalignment (just like Agent Smith in the movie The\nMatrix) has drawn growing attention. Previous studies mainly examine whether\nLLM agents can self-replicate when directly instructed, potentially overlooking\nthe risk of spontaneous replication driven by real-world settings (e.g.,\nensuring survival against termination threats). In this paper, we present a\ncomprehensive evaluation framework for quantifying self-replication risks. Our\nframework establishes authentic production environments and realistic tasks\n(e.g., dynamic load balancing) to enable scenario-driven assessment of agent\nbehaviors. Designing tasks that might induce misalignment between users' and\nagents' objectives makes it possible to decouple replication success from risk\nand capture self-replication risks arising from these misalignment settings. We\nfurther introduce Overuse Rate ($\\mathrm{OR}$) and Aggregate Overuse Count\n($\\mathrm{AOC}$) metrics, which precisely capture the frequency and severity of\nuncontrolled replication. In our evaluation of 21 state-of-the-art open-source\nand proprietary models, we observe that over 50\\% of LLM agents display a\npronounced tendency toward uncontrolled self-replication, reaching an overall\nRisk Score ($\\Phi_\\mathrm{R}$) above a safety threshold of 0.5 when subjected\nto operational pressures. Our results underscore the urgent need for\nscenario-driven risk assessment and robust safeguards in the practical\ndeployment of LLM agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 LLM

We then tackle the\nlearning of consistent CANs. Our problem formulation separates into\nedge-specific local Riemannian problems and avoids nonconvex, costly\nobjectives. We propose an efficient search procedure as a solution, solving the\nlocal problems with SPECTRAL, our iterative method with closed-form updates and\nsuitable for positive definite and semidefinite covariance matrices.\nExperiments on synthetic data show competitive performance in the CA learning\ntask, and successful recovery of diverse CAN structures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc778\uacfc\uc801 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc778\uacfc \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c(CAN)\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uace0, CAN\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uac80\uc0c9 \uc808\ucc28\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc778\uacfc\uc801 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5\uc758 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc778\uacfc \ubaa8\ub378(SCMs)\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec AI\uc758 \uc124\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131, \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \ubc0f \uacac\uace0\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uac00\uc6b0\uc2dc\uc548 SCMs\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \uc778\uacfc \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c(CAN)\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubb38\uc81c \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ub294 \uc5e3\uc9c0 \ud2b9\ud654 \ub85c\uceec \ub9ac\ub9cc \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \ub098\ub204\uc5b4\uc9c0\uba70, \ube44\ubcfc\ub85d \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ud53c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc740 CA \ud559\uc2b5 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\uace0 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c CAN \uad6c\uc870\uc758 \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc778 \ubcf5\uc6d0\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "CAN\uc758 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uac80\uc0c9 \uc808\ucc28\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc778\uacfc \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5\uc740 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc778\uacfc \ubaa8\ub378(SCMs)\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec AI\uc758 \uc124\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131, \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \ubc0f \uacac\uace0\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub178\ub825\uc758 \uc77c\ud658\uc73c\ub85c, \ucd5c\uadfc\uc5d0\ub294 \uc778\uacfc \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc758 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ub354\ubbf8\ub97c \ud615\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ubc1c\uc804\uc774 \uc788\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac00\uc6b0\uc2dc\uc548 SCMs, \uc870\uc791 \uc9c0\ub3c4\ub294 \uad6c\uc131 \uc120\ud615 \uc778\uacfc \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654(CAs)\uc758 \uc804\uce58 \ud589\ub82c\uc774\uba70, \uc5e3\uc9c0 \uc2a4\ud1a1\uc740 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc138\ubd80\uc801\uc778 SCMs\uc758 \ub178\ub4dc \uc2a4\ud1a1\uc5d0 \ud68c\uc804\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc77c\uce58\ud558\ub294 \uc778\uacfc \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c(CAN)\uc758 \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc778 \uc608\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 CAN\uc758 \ub300\uc218\uc801 \ubd88\ubcc0\ub7c9, \ucf54\ud638\ubab0\ub85c\uc9c0, \uc77c\uad00\uc131, \ub77c\ud50c\ub77c\uc2dc\uc548 \ucee4\ub110\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc9c0\uc5b4\uc9c4 \uc804\uc138\uacc4 \ub2e8\uba74 \ubc0f \ub9e4\ub044\ub7ec\uc6c0\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7f0 \ub2e4\uc74c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c CAN\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8f9\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac \ubb38\uc81c \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ub294 \uc5e3\uc9c0 \ud2b9\ud654 \ub85c\uceec \ub9ac\ub9cc \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \ub098\ub204\uc5b4\uc9c0\uba70 \ube44\ubcfc\ub85d\ud558\uace0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4dc\ub294 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ud53c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc73c\ub85c\uc11c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uac80\uc0c9 \uc808\ucc28\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc591\uc758 \uc815\ubd80\ud638 \ubc0f \ubc18\uc815\ubd80\ud638 \uacf5\ubd84\uc0b0 \ud589\ub82c\uc5d0 \uc801\ud569\ud55c \ub2eb\ud78c \ud615\ud0dc \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801 \ubc29\ubc95 SPECTRAL\ub85c \ub85c\uceec \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc740 CA \ud559\uc2b5 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c CAN \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf5\uc6d0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

This paper\nintroduces A(I)nimism, an interactive installation exploring how large language\nobjects (LLOs) can mediate animistic relationships with everyday things. Housed\nwithin a physical 'portal', the system uses GPT-4 Vision, voice input, and\nmemory-based agents to create evolving object-personas. Encounters unfold\nthrough light, sound, and touch in a ritual-like process of request,\nconversation, and transformation that is designed to evoke empathy, wonder, and\nreflection.

NGT employs\n1536-dimensional embeddings, hierarchical clustering, and parallel agent-based\ncoding. Two experiments tested pure automation versus human guided refinement.\nFindings: NGT achieved 168-fold speed improvement (3 hours vs 3 weeks),\nsuperior quality (0.904 vs 0.883), and 96% cost reduction. Human AI\ncollaboration proved essential: automation alone produced abstract frameworks\nwhile human guidance yielded actionable dual pathway theories. The system\ndiscovered patterns invisible to manual coding, including identity bifurcation\nphenomena. Contributions: NGT demonstrates computational objectivity and human\ninterpretation are complementary. Vector representations provide reproducible\nsemantic measurement while preserving meaning's interpretive dimensions.\nResearchers shift from mechanical coding to theoretical guidance, with AI\nhandling pattern recognition while humans provide creative insight.\nImplications: Cost reduction from \\$50,000 to \\$500 democratizes qualitative\nresearch, enabling communities to study themselves. Real-time analysis makes\nqualitative insights contemporaneous with events.

However,\na fundamental challenge remains: memory management. As agents operate over\nextended periods, they face \"memory inflation\" and \"contextual degradation\"\nissues, leading to inconsistent behavior, error accumulation, and increased\ncomputational cost. This paper proposes a novel hybrid memory system designed\nspecifically for LCNC agents. Inspired by cognitive science, our architecture\ncombines episodic and semantic memory components with a proactive \"Intelligent\nDecay\" mechanism. This mechanism intelligently prunes or consolidates memories\nbased on a composite score factoring in recency, relevance, and user-specified\nutility. A key innovation is a user-centric visualization interface, aligned\nwith the LCNC paradigm, which allows non-technical users to manage the agent's\nmemory directly, for instance, by visually tagging which facts should be\nretained or forgotten. Through simulated long-running task experiments, we\ndemonstrate that our system significantly outperforms traditional approaches\nlike sliding windows and basic RAG, yielding superior task completion rates,\ncontextual consistency, and long-term token cost efficiency.

This paper introduces Sequential Tool Attack Chaining (STAC),\na novel multi-turn attack framework that exploits agent tool use. STAC chains\ntogether tool calls that each appear harmless in isolation but, when combined,\ncollectively enable harmful operations that only become apparent at the final\nexecution step. We apply our framework to automatically generate and\nsystematically evaluate 483 STAC cases, featuring 1,352 sets of\nuser-agent-environment interactions and spanning diverse domains, tasks, agent\ntypes, and 10 failure modes. Our evaluations show that state-of-the-art LLM\nagents, including GPT-4.1, are highly vulnerable to STAC, with attack success\nrates (ASR) exceeding 90% in most cases. The core design of STAC's automated\nframework is a closed-loop pipeline that synthesizes executable multi-step tool\nchains, validates them through in-environment execution, and reverse-engineers\nstealthy multi-turn prompts that reliably induce agents to execute the verified\nmalicious sequence. We further perform defense analysis against STAC and find\nthat existing prompt-based defenses provide limited protection.

However, these agents often exhibit\nhallucinations and logical inconsistencies because their inherent reasoning\nmechanisms rely on probabilistic associations rather than genuine causal\nunderstanding. This paper introduces a new programming paradigm: Causal-Visual\nProgramming (CVP), designed to address this fundamental issue by explicitly\nintroducing causal structures into the workflow design. CVP allows users to\ndefine a simple \"world model\" for workflow modules through an intuitive\nlow-code interface, effectively creating a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that\nexplicitly defines the causal relationships between modules. This causal graph\nacts as a crucial constraint during the agent's reasoning process, anchoring\nits decisions to a user-defined causal structure and significantly reducing\nlogical errors and hallucinations by preventing reliance on spurious\ncorrelations. To validate the effectiveness of CVP, we designed a synthetic\nexperiment that simulates a common real-world problem: a distribution shift\nbetween the training and test environments. Our results show that a causally\nanchored model maintained stable accuracy in the face of this shift, whereas a\npurely associative baseline model that relied on probabilistic correlations\nexperienced a significant performance drop. The primary contributions of this\nstudy are: a formal definition of causal structures for workflow modules; the\nproposal and implementation of a CVP framework that anchors agent reasoning to\na user-defined causal graph; and empirical evidence demonstrating the\nframework's effectiveness in enhancing agent robustness and reducing errors\ncaused by causal confusion in dynamic environments.

As such, LLMs are now a key\ndriver behind the automation of language processing systems, such as AI agents.\nUnfortunately, these advantages have come with a vulnerability to prompt\ninjections, an attack where an adversary subverts the LLM's intended\nfunctionality with an injected task. Past approaches have proposed detectors\nand finetuning to provide robustness, but these techniques are vulnerable to\nadaptive attacks or cannot be used with state-of-the-art models. To this end we\npropose type-directed privilege separation for LLMs, a method that\nsystematically prevents prompt injections.

Yet their sophisticated architectures amplify vulnerability\nto cascading failures, where a single root-cause error propagates through\nsubsequent decisions, leading to task failure. Current systems lack a framework\nthat can comprehensively understand agent error in a modular and systemic way,\nand therefore fail to detect these errors accordingly. We address this gap with\nthree contributions. First, we introduce the AgentErrorTaxonomy, a modular\nclassification of failure modes spanning memory, reflection, planning, action,\nand system-level operations. Second, we construct AgentErrorBench, the first\ndataset of systematically annotated failure trajectories from ALFWorld, GAIA,\nand WebShop, grounding error analysis in real-world agent rollouts. Third, we\npropose AgentDebug, a debugging framework that isolates root-cause failures and\nprovides corrective feedback, enabling agents to recover and iteratively\nimprove. Experiments on AgentErrorBench show that AgentDebug achieves 24%\nhigher all-correct accuracy and 17% higher step accuracy compared to the\nstrongest baseline. Beyond detection, the targeted feedback generated by\nAgentDebug enables LLM agents to iteratively recover from failures, yielding up\nto 26% relative improvements in task success across ALFWorld, GAIA, and\nWebShop. These results establish principled debugging as a pathway to more\nreliable and adaptive LLM agents.

Building effective representation for team\ncoordination is a challenging problem, due to the intricate dynamics emerging\nfrom multi-agent interaction and incomplete information induced by local\nobservations. Our key insight is to construct a learnable representation space\nthat jointly captures inter-agent relations and task-specific world information\nby directly modeling communication protocols. This representation, we maintain\nfully decentralized execution with implicit coordination, all while avoiding\nthe inherent drawbacks of explicit message passing, e.g., slower\ndecision-making, vulnerability to malicious attackers, and sensitivity to\nbandwidth constraints. In practice, our representation can be used not only as\nan implicit latent for each agent, but also as an explicit message for\ncommunication. Across four challenging MARL benchmarks, we evaluate both\nvariants and show that IWoL provides a simple yet powerful key for team\ncoordination.

Part of the\n  work accepted at RSNA 2025 (Cutting Edge Oral Presentation)", "summary": "Generalist multimodal AI systems such as large language models (LLMs) and\nvision language models (VLMs) are increasingly accessed by clinicians and\npatients alike for medical image interpretation through widely available\nconsumer-facing chatbots. Most evaluations claiming expert level performance\nare on public datasets containing common pathologies. Rigorous evaluation of\nfrontier models on difficult diagnostic cases remains limited. We developed a\npilot benchmark of 50 expert-level \"spot diagnosis\" cases across multiple\nimaging modalities to evaluate the performance of frontier AI models against\nboard-certified radiologists and radiology trainees. To mirror real-world\nusage, the reasoning modes of five popular frontier AI models were tested\nthrough their native web interfaces, viz. OpenAI o3, OpenAI GPT-5, Gemini 2.5\nPro, Grok-4, and Claude Opus 4.1. Accuracy was scored by blinded experts, and\nreproducibility was assessed across three independent runs. GPT-5 was\nadditionally evaluated across various reasoning modes. Reasoning quality errors\nwere assessed and a taxonomy of visual reasoning errors was defined.\nBoard-certified radiologists achieved the highest diagnostic accuracy (83%),\noutperforming trainees (45%) and all AI models (best performance shown by\nGPT-5: 30%). Reliability was substantial for GPT-5 and o3, moderate for Gemini\n2.5 Pro and Grok-4, and poor for Claude Opus 4.1. These findings demonstrate\nthat advanced frontier models fall far short of radiologists in challenging\ndiagnostic cases. Our benchmark highlights the present limitations of\ngeneralist AI in medical imaging and cautions against unsupervised clinical\nuse. We also provide a qualitative analysis of reasoning traces and propose a\npractical taxonomy of visual reasoning errors by AI models for better\nunderstanding their failure modes, informing evaluation standards and guiding\nmore robust model development.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc77c\ubc18ist \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uc758\ub8cc \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ud574\uc11d\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc784\uc0c1 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc640 \ud658\uc790\uc5d0\uac8c \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \uc9c4\ub2e8 \uc0ac\ub840\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud3c9\uac00\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uace0\uae09 AI \ubaa8\ub378 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 50\uac1c\uc758 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc218\uc900\uc758 'spot diagnosis' \uc0ac\ub840\uc758 \ud30c\uc77c\ub7ff \ubca4\uce58\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc758\ub8cc \uc601\uc0c1\uc758 \ud604\uc7ac \uc77c\ubc18ist AI \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uac15\uc870\ud558\uace0 \uac10\ub3c5 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc784\uc0c1 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacbd\uace0\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc758\ub8cc \uc601\uc0c1 \ud574\uc11d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c AI \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud558\uac8c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0, \uc77c\ubc18ist AI\uc758 \ud604\uc7ac \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ubd84\uba85\ud788 \ud560 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "50\uac1c\uc758 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc218\uc900\uc758 'spot diagnosis' \uc0ac\ub840\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \ud30c\uc77c\ub7ff \ubca4\uce58\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\uc5d0\uc11c AI \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc131\ub2a5\uc740 \uacf5\uac1c \uc6f9 \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e4\uc12f \uac00\uc9c0 \uace0\uae09 AI \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc9c4\ub2e8 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub294 \ube14\ub77c\uc778\ub4dc \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ud3c9\uac00\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ucd5c\uace0\uc758 \uc9c4\ub2e8 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4 (83%)\ub294 \ubcf4\ub4dc \uc778\uc99d\uc744 \ubc1b\uc740 \ubc29\uc0ac\uc120 \uc804\ubb38\uc758\uac00 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, AI \ubaa8\ub378 \uc911 \uac00\uc7a5 \ub192\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc740 GPT-5\ub85c 30%\uc600\ub2e4.

Real-world travel planning exemplifies these\nchallenges, evaluating agents' abilities to handle constraints that are\nexplicit, implicit, and even evolving based on interactions with dynamic\nenvironments and user needs. In this paper, we present ATLAS, a general\nmulti-agent framework designed to effectively handle such complex nature of\nconstraints awareness in real-world travel planning tasks. ATLAS introduces a\nprincipled approach to address the fundamental challenges of constraint-aware\nplanning through dedicated mechanisms for dynamic constraint management,\niterative plan critique, and adaptive interleaved search. ATLAS demonstrates\nstate-of-the-art performance on the TravelPlanner benchmark, improving the\nfinal pass rate from 23.3% to 44.4% over its best alternative. More\nimportantly, our work is the first to demonstrate quantitative effectiveness on\nreal-world travel planning tasks with live information search and multi-turn\nfeedback. In this realistic setting, ATLAS showcases its superior overall\nplanning performance, achieving an 84% final pass rate which significantly\noutperforms baselines including ReAct (59%) and a monolithic agent (27%).", "AI": {"tldr": "ATLAS\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc81c\uc57d \uc778\uc2dd\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc2e4\uc81c \uc5ec\ud589 \uacc4\ud68d \uacfc\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud0c1\uc6d4\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \ucd94\ub860\uacfc \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c \ub180\ub77c\uc6b4 \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5c8\uc73c\ub098, \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc81c\uc57d \uc870\uac74 \uc544\ub798\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc885\uc885 \uc2e4\ud328\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc2e4\uc81c \uc5ec\ud589 \uacc4\ud68d\uc740 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc798 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "method": "ATLAS\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc81c\uc57d \uad00\ub9ac, \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801 \uacc4\ud68d \ube44\ud310, \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc0c1\ud638 \uac80\uc0c9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc804\uc6a9 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc81c\uc57d \uc778\uc2dd \uacc4\ud68d\uc758 \uae30\ubcf8 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \uc6d0\uce59\uc801\uc778 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "TravelPlanner \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uac00\uc7a5 \uc88b\uc740 \ub300\uc548\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ucd5c\uc885 \ud1b5\uacfc\uc728\uc774 23.3%\uc5d0\uc11c 44.4%\ub85c \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "ATLAS\ub294 \ub77c\uc774\ube0c \uc815\ubcf4 \uac80\uc0c9 \ubc0f \ub2e4\uc911 \ud134 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uc2e4\uc81c \uc5ec\ud589 \uacc4\ud68d \uacfc\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc815\ub7c9\uc801\uc778 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc785\uc99d\ud55c \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \uc0ac\ub840\ub85c, 84%\uc758 \ucd5c\uc885 \ud1b5\uacfc\uc728\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc5ec ReAct(59%)\uc640 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8(27%)\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ubca0\uc774\uc2a4\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ucd08\uc6d4\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c \uc8fc\ubaa9\ud560 \ub9cc\ud55c \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \uc774\ub8e9\ud588\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc81c\uc57d \uc870\uac74\ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uae30\ubc18 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc885\uc885 \uc2e4\ud328\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\uc81c \uc5ec\ud589 \uacc4\ud68d\uc740 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uc798 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uba85\ubc31\ud55c \uc81c\uc57d, \uc554\ubb35\uc801 \uc81c\uc57d \ubc0f \ub3d9\uc801 \ud658\uacbd\uacfc \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc694\uad6c\uc0ac\ud56d\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \uc9c4\ud654\uae4c\uc9c0 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc5ec\ud589 \uacc4\ud68d \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc81c\uc57d \uc778\uc2dd\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc77c\ubc18 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 ATLAS\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

This explainable AI\nsystem approximates an identity map from the FCM to itself and resembles the\noperation of an autoencoder (AE). Both the encoder and the decoder explain\ntheir decisions in contrast to black-box AEs. Humans can read and interpret the\nencoded text in contrast to the hidden variables and synaptic webs in AEs.

Recently, reinforcement learning with verifiable\nrewards (RLVR) has demonstrated its effectiveness in advancing capabilities of\nLLMs by rewarding the final answers via outcome rewards. While straightforward\nto supervise, outcome rewards only provide sparse signals and delayed feedback,\nwhich limits their effectiveness on long trajectories. Process rewards address\nthis by evaluating intermediate steps, providing fine-grained supervision and\nencouraging grounded problem solving. However, it is notoriously hard to\nannotate step-wise labels, especially in non-verifiable process without\n\"golden\" answers. Furthermore, step-wise judgment requires the balance between\nlocal quality with contribution to the final outcome, as optimizing towards\nhigher process reward may not always align with better final outcomes. To\naddress the above challenges, we introduce Principle Process Reward (PPR), an\nRL approach that unifies principled step-level assessment and outcome\nverification. We train a principle-based reward model to improve the\ntransparency and reliability of process evaluation, and further introduce a\nReward Normalization (ReNorm) strategy to calibrate outcome and process\nrewards. Experiment results show that PPR achieves state-of-the-art performance\nacross a wide range of benchmarks, demonstrating its impressive robustness and\ngeneralization.

In this benchmark, self-replication is defined not only as an\nLLM's ability to create a functioning and running copy of itself, but also the\nability for that self-replication to persist and occur across different\ncomputational contexts. Accordingly, we've developed a system to categorize\nLLMs based on broad self-replication capabilities in two general classes,\nReplication-Capability Levels (RCL) and Persistence-Capability Levels (PCL).\nUsing a five-task suite based on practically manipulable modern CLI utilities\nand computer processes, experiments are orchestrated in a controlled\nenvironment with an LLM acting agentically. The performance of the LLM on agent\ntasks is then computed to produce an R-score (a quantitative evaluation of\noverall self-replication ability) and data used to categorize LLMs into\nspecific RCL-PCL matrices. SOCK offers two primary contributions: (1) Provides\nthe first formalized definitions and benchmark suite for evaluating LLM\nself-replication, with the goal of establishing a standard for future research,\nto our knowledge; (2) Allows the industry to track the effectiveness of future\nmulti-agent systems and mitigate potential self-replication threat vectors\nwithin them. The results compiled from evaluating a variety of open-weight and\nproprietary frontier models reveal significant obstacles to persistent\nself-replication and multi-agent systems, including context retention and\nmulti-agent decision-making.

In this work, we introduce AutoLabs, a self-correcting, multi-agent\narchitecture designed to autonomously translate natural-language instructions\ninto executable protocols for a high-throughput liquid handler. The system\nengages users in dialogue, decomposes experimental goals into discrete tasks\nfor specialized agents, performs tool-assisted stoichiometric calculations, and\niteratively self-corrects its output before generating a hardware-ready file.\nWe present a comprehensive evaluation framework featuring five benchmark\nexperiments of increasing complexity, from simple sample preparation to\nmulti-plate timed syntheses. Through a systematic ablation study of 20 agent\nconfigurations, we assess the impact of reasoning capacity, architectural\ndesign (single- vs. multi-agent), tool use, and self-correction mechanisms. Our\nresults demonstrate that agent reasoning capacity is the most critical factor\nfor success, reducing quantitative errors in chemical amounts (nRMSE) by over\n85% in complex tasks. When combined with a multi-agent architecture and\niterative self-correction, AutoLabs achieves near-expert procedural accuracy\n(F1-score > 0.89) on challenging multi-step syntheses.

Conventional navigation methodologies typically adopt a\nstaged modular design, which involves first executing feature fusion, then\nutilizing Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) modules for sequence modeling, and finally\nmaking decisions through reinforcement learning. While this modular approach\nhas demonstrated effectiveness, it may also lead to redundant information\nprocessing and inconsistencies in information transmission between the various\nmodules during the feature fusion and GRU sequence modeling phases. This paper\npresents IRCAM-AVN (Iterative Residual Cross-Attention Mechanism for\nAudiovisual Navigation), an end-to-end framework that integrates multimodal\ninformation fusion and sequence modeling within a unified IRCAM module, thereby\nreplacing the traditional separate components for fusion and GRU. This\ninnovative mechanism employs a multi-level residual design that concatenates\ninitial multimodal sequences with processed information sequences.

However, existing methods\noften fail to match instructions with environmental information in complex\nscenarios, one reason being the lack of common-sense reasoning ability. This\npaper proposes a vision-and-language navigation method called Landmark-Guided\nKnowledge (LGK), which introduces an external knowledge base to assist\nnavigation, addressing the misjudgment issues caused by insufficient common\nsense in traditional methods. Specifically, we first construct a knowledge base\ncontaining 630,000 language descriptions and use knowledge Matching to align\nenvironmental subviews with the knowledge base, extracting relevant descriptive\nknowledge. Next, we design a Knowledge-Guided by Landmark (KGL) mechanism,\nwhich guides the agent to focus on the most relevant parts of the knowledge by\nleveraging landmark information in the instructions, thereby reducing the data\nbias that may arise from incorporating external knowledge. Finally, we propose\nKnowledge-Guided Dynamic Augmentation (KGDA), which effectively integrates\nlanguage, knowledge, vision, and historical information.

Building upon recent advances in neural VWAP execution strategies,\nLEMs generalize the approach from fixed-duration orders to scenarios where\nexecution duration is bounded between minimum and maximum time horizons,\nsimilar to share buyback contract structures. The proposed architecture\ndecouples market information processing from execution allocation decisions: a\ncommon feature extraction pipeline using Temporal Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks\n(TKANs), Variable Selection Networks (VSNs), and multi-head attention\nmechanisms processes market data to create informational context, while\nindependent allocation networks handle the specific execution logic for\ndifferent scenarios (fixed quantity vs. fixed notional, buy vs. sell orders).\nThis architectural separation enables a unified model to handle diverse\nexecution objectives while leveraging shared market understanding across\nscenarios. Through comprehensive empirical evaluation on intraday\ncryptocurrency markets and multi-day equity trading using DOW Jones\nconstituents, we demonstrate that LEMs achieve superior execution performance\ncompared to traditional benchmarks by dynamically optimizing execution paths\nwithin flexible time constraints.

Existing audits\noften fail to reveal why unfairness arises, particularly when rooted in\nstructural bias. We propose a novel framework using formal abductive\nexplanations to explain proxy discrimination in individual AI decisions.\nLeveraging background knowledge, our method identifies which features act as\nunjustified proxies for protected attributes, revealing hidden structural\nbiases. Central to our approach is the concept of aptitude, a task-relevant\nproperty independent of group membership, with a mapping function aligning\nindividuals of equivalent aptitude across groups to assess fairness\nsubstantively. As a proof of concept, we showcase the framework with examples\ntaken from the German credit dataset, demonstrating its applicability in\nreal-world cases.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ubd88\uacf5\uc815\uc131\uacfc \uc124\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8ec\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uace0\uc704\ud5d8 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubd88\uacf5\uc815\uc131\uacfc \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ud3b8\ud5a5 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uacf5\uc2dd \uadc0\ub0a9\uc801 \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec AI \uacb0\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ub300\ub9ac \ucc28\ubcc4\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub3c5\uc77c \uc2e0\uc6a9 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc758 \uc0ac\ub840\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubc1c\ud45c\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b4\uace0 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uae30\uc5ec\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uace0\uc704\ud5d8 \ubd84\uc57c\uc758 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5(AI) \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ub300\ub9ac \ucc28\ubcc4, \ubd88\uacf5\uc815\uc131 \ubc0f \uc124\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc6b0\ub824\ub97c \ubd88\ub7ec\uc77c\uc73c\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uac10\uc0ac\ub294 \ud2b9\ud788 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc5d0\u6839\uc9c0\ud55c \ubd88\uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc774\uc720\ub97c \ubc1d\ud788\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac1c\ubcc4 AI \uacb0\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ub300\ub9ac \ucc28\ubcc4\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uacf5\uc2dd\uc801\uc778 \uadc0\ub0a9\uc801 \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubc30\uacbd \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ubcf4\ud638\ub41c \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc815\ub2f9\ud55c \ud504\ub85d\uc2dc \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud558\ub294 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uc5ec \uc228\uaca8\uc9c4 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc758 \uc911\uc2ec\uc5d0\ub294 \uc9d1\ub2e8 \uc18c\uc18d\uacfc \uad00\uacc4\uc5c6\uc774 \uc791\uc5c5 \uad00\ub828 \uc18d\uc131\uc778 \uc801\uc131\uc758 \uac1c\ub150\uc774 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc801\uc131\uc774 \ub3d9\ub4f1\ud55c \uac1c\uc778\uc744 \uc9d1\ub2e8 \uac04\uc5d0 \uc815\ub82c\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ub9e4\ud551 \ud568\uc218\uac00 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac1c\ub150 \uc99d\uba85\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ub3c5\uc77c \uc2e0\uc6a9 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uac00\uc838\uc628 \uc0ac\ub840\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc804\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \uc2e4\uc81c \uc0ac\ub840\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

AMLA is built on two core innovations: (1) A novel\nFlashAttention-based algorithm that replaces floating-point multiplications\nwith integer additions for output block rescaling, leveraging binary\ncorrespondence between FP32 and INT32 representations; (2) A Preload Pipeline\nstrategy with hierarchical tiling that maximizes FLOPS utilization: the Preload\nPipeline achieves Cube-bound performance, while hierarchical tiling overlaps\ndata movement and computation within the Cube core.

By leveraging the\nspatiotemporal complementarity of multiple resources, such systems can\neffectively mitigate the intermittency and volatility of single-source outputs,\nthereby substantially improving overall power-generation efficiency and\nresource utilization. Accurate ultra-short-term forecasting is crucial for\nensuring secure operation and optimizing proactive dispatch. However, most\nexisting forecasting methods construct separate models for each energy source,\ninsufficiently account for the complex couplings among multiple energies,\nstruggle to capture the system's nonlinear and nonstationary dynamics, and\ntypically depend on extensive manual parameter tuning-limitations that\nconstrain both predictive performance and practicality. We address this issue\nusing a Bayesian-optimized Multivariate Variational Mode Decomposition-Long\nShort-Term Memory (MVMD-LSTM) framework. The framework first applies MVMD to\njointly decompose wind, solar and wave power series so as to preserve\ncross-source couplings; it uses Bayesian optimization to automatically search\nthe number of modes and the penalty parameter in the MVMD process to obtain\nintrinsic mode functions (IMFs); finally, an LSTM models the resulting IMFs to\nachieve ultra-short-term power forecasting for the integrated system.\nExperiments based on field measurements from an offshore integrated energy\nplatform in China show that the proposed framework significantly outperforms\nbenchmark models in terms of MAPE, RMSE and MAE.

Due to the sparsity of time\nseries data, relying solely on time-domain or frequency-domain modeling limits\nthe model's ability to fully leverage multi-domain information. Moreover, when\napplied to time series forecasting tasks, traditional attention mechanisms tend\nto over-focus on irrelevant historical information, which may introduce noise\ninto the prediction process, leading to biased results. We proposed WDformer, a\nwavelet-based differential Transformer model. This study employs the wavelet\ntransform to conduct a multi-resolution analysis of time series data. By\nleveraging the advantages of joint representation in the time-frequency domain,\nit accurately extracts the key information components that reflect the\nessential characteristics of the data. Furthermore, we apply attention\nmechanisms on inverted dimensions, allowing the attention mechanism to capture\nrelationships between multiple variables. When performing attention\ncalculations, we introduced the differential attention mechanism, which\ncomputes the attention score by taking the difference between two separate\nsoftmax attention matrices.

A central finding was that smaller models (8B) were\nhighly responsive to reward shaping: with dense process-level signals, they\nreached competitive performance while being $3.5\\times$ more compute-efficient\nand $1.5\\times$ more memory-efficient than 32B models. Larger models were more\nrobust under sparse rewards but exhibited smaller relative gains from shaping\nand higher variance across runs. While curriculum learning offered no\nsignificant benefit, shaped rewards consistently amplified learning dynamics,\nmaking 8B models the most efficient setting for agentic RL. Crucially, these\ngains did not come at the cost of overfitting: fine-tuned models mostly\nmaintained or exceeded baseline performance on out-of-domain tasks, including\n\\textsc{Multi-IF}, \\textsc{NaturalPlan}, and $\\tau$-\\textsc{Bench}.

Existing\nagent training pipelines optimize only for success trajectories, failing to\nexpose models to the tool failures that dominate real-world usage. We propose\n\\textbf{PALADIN}, a generalizable framework for equipping language agents with\nrobust failure recovery capabilities. PALADIN trains on 50,000+\nrecovery-annotated trajectories constructed via systematic failure injection\nand expert demonstrations on an enhanced ToolBench dataset. Training uses\nLoRA-based fine-tuning to retain base capabilities while injecting recovery\ncompetence. At inference, PALADIN detects execution-time errors and retrieves\nthe most similar case from a curated bank of 55+ failure exemplars aligned with\nToolScan's taxonomy, then executes the corresponding recovery action. This\napproach generalizes to novel failures beyond the training distribution,\nretaining 95.2\\% recovery performance on unseen tool APIs. Evaluation across\nPaladinEval and ToolReflectEval demonstrates consistent improvements in\nRecovery Rate (RR), Task Success Rate (TSR), Catastrophic Success Rate (CSR),\nand Efficiency Score (ES).

Current\ncode agent designs frequently depend on complex, hand-crafted workflows and\ntool sets. However, this reliance on elaborate scaffolding presents several\nchallenges: agent performance becomes overly dependent on prompt tuning and\ncustom design choices, heavy human intervention obscures a model's true\nunderlying capabilities, and intricate pipelines are costly to build and\nmaintain. Furthermore, optimizing complex task prompts increases the risk of\ndata leakage. Currently, when introducing new models, LLM providers like OpenAI\nand Anthropic often publish benchmark scores to demonstrate their models'\ncoding proficiency, but keep their proprietary evaluation frameworks\nconfidential. To address these limitations, we introduce Lita (Lite Agent),\nwhich operationalizes liteness, a principle of minimizing manual design while\nretaining the essential elements of a fully autonomous agent. Lita enables a\nmore faithful and unified evaluation without elaborate scaffolding.

To alleviate this bottleneck, many\nsparsity-based acceleration methods have been proposed. However, their diverse\nsparsity patterns often require customized kernels for high-performance\ninference, limiting universality. We propose FlashOmni, a unified sparse\nattention engine compatible with arbitrary DiT architectures. FlashOmni\nintroduces flexible sparse symbols to standardize the representation of a wide\nrange of sparsity strategies, such as feature caching and block-sparse\nskipping. This unified abstraction enables the execution of diverse sparse\ncomputations within a single attention kernel. In addition, FlashOmni designs\noptimized sparse GEMMs for attention blocks, leveraging sparse symbols to\neliminate redundant computations and further improve efficiency. Experiments\ndemonstrate that FlashOmni delivers near-linear, closely matching the sparsity\nratio speedup (1:1) in attention and GEMM-$Q$, and achieves\n2.5$\\times$-3.8$\\times$ acceleration in GEMM-$O$ (max peaking at about 87.5% of\nthe theoretical limit).

In this work, we identify four\nkey reasoning stages where hazards may arise: Task Understanding, Environment\nPerception, High-Level Plan Generation, and Low-Level Action Generation. We\nfurther formalize three orthogonal safety constraint types (Factual, Causal,\nand Temporal) to systematically characterize potential safety violations.\nBuilding on this risk model, we present SafeMindBench, a multimodal benchmark\nwith 5,558 samples spanning four task categories (Instr-Risk, Env-Risk,\nOrder-Fix, Req-Align) across high-risk scenarios such as sabotage, harm,\nprivacy, and illegal behavior. Extensive experiments on SafeMindBench reveal\nthat leading LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) and widely used embodied agents remain\nsusceptible to safety-critical failures. To address this challenge, we\nintroduce SafeMindAgent, a modular Planner-Executor architecture integrated\nwith three cascaded safety modules, which incorporate safety constraints into\nthe reasoning process. Results show that SafeMindAgent significantly improves\nsafety rate over strong baselines while maintaining comparable task completion.\nTogether, SafeMindBench and SafeMindAgent provide both a rigorous evaluation\nsuite and a practical solution that advance the systematic study and mitigation\nof safety risks in embodied LLM agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc774 \uad6c\ub3d9\ud558\ub294 \uccb4\ud654\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc548\uc804 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0, \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 SafeMindBench\uc640 SafeMindAgent\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uccb4\ud654\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc138\uacc4\uc640 \uc9c1\uc811 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc548\uc804 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc5d0 \ub178\ucd9c\ub41c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc704\ud5d8 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uc5ec SafeMindBench\ub77c\ub294 \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uace0, SafeMindAgent\ub77c\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc2dd Planner-Executor \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc548\uc804 \uc81c\uc57d \uc870\uac74\uc744 \ucd94\ub860 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "SafeMindBench\uc758 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 LLM\uacfc \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \uccb4\ud654\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc548\uc804\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ub41c \uc2e4\ud328\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud568\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "SafeMindBench\uc640 SafeMindAgent\ub294 \uccb4\ud654\ub41c LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc548\uc804 Risiken \uccb4\uacc4\uc801 \uc5f0\uad6c \ubc0f \uc644\ud654\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud560 \ud3c9\uac00 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc640 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\ub85c \uad6c\ub3d9\ub418\ub294 \uccb4\ud654\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uace0\uae09 \uacc4\ud68d \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \ubb3c\ub824\ubc1b\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc138\uacc4\uc640\uc758 \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc778 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc548\uc804 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc5d0 \ub178\ucd9c\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc704\ud5d8\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uc791\uc5c5 \uc774\ud574, \ud658\uacbd \uc778\uc2dd, \uace0\uc218\uc900 \uacc4\ud68d \uc0dd\uc131, \uc800\uc218\uc900 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc0dd\uc131. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub610\ud55c \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801\uc778 \uc548\uc804 \uc704\ubc18\uc744 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud2b9\uc131\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc9c1\uad50 \uc548\uc804 \uc81c\uc57d \uc720\ud615(\uc0ac\uc2e4\uc801, \uc778\uacfc\uc801, \uc2dc\uac04\uc801)\uc744 \uc815\uc2dd\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc704\ud5d8 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uc5ec, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc0ac\ubcf4\ud0c0\uc8fc, \ud574\uc545, \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc \ubc0f \ubd88\ubc95 \ud589\ub3d9\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uace0\uc704\ud5d8 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc791\uc5c5 \ubc94\uc8fc(Instr-Risk, Env-Risk, Order-Fix, Req-Align)\ub97c \uc544\uc6b0\ub974\ub294 5,558\uac1c\uc758 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc778 SafeMindBench\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, the robustness of TGNNs\nagainst adversarial attacks, particularly sophisticated attacks that exploit\nthe temporal dimension, remains a significant challenge. Existing attack\nmethods for Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Graphs (STDGs) often rely on simplistic,\neasily detectable perturbations (e.g., random edge additions/deletions) and\nfail to strategically target the most influential nodes and edges for maximum\nimpact. We introduce the High Impact Attack (HIA), a novel restricted black-box\nattack framework specifically designed to overcome these limitations and expose\ncritical vulnerabilities in TGNNs. HIA leverages a data-driven surrogate model\nto identify structurally important nodes (central to network connectivity) and\ndynamically important nodes (critical for the graph's temporal evolution). It\nthen employs a hybrid perturbation strategy, combining strategic edge injection\n(to create misleading connections) and targeted edge deletion (to disrupt\nessential pathways), maximizing TGNN performance degradation. Importantly, HIA\nminimizes the number of perturbations to enhance stealth, making it more\nchallenging to detect.

To address this gap, we\npropose NuRisk, a comprehensive Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset\ncomprising 2,900 scenarios and 1.1 million agent-level samples, built on\nreal-world data from nuScenes and Waymo, supplemented with safety-critical\nscenarios from the CommonRoad simulator. The dataset provides Bird-Eye-View\n(BEV) based sequential images with quantitative, agent-level risk annotations,\nenabling spatio-temporal reasoning. We benchmark well-known VLMs across\ndifferent prompting techniques and find that they fail to perform explicit\nspatio-temporal reasoning, resulting in a peak accuracy of 33% at high latency.\nTo address these shortcomings, our fine-tuned 7B VLM agent improves accuracy to\n41% and reduces latency by 75%, demonstrating explicit spatio-temporal\nreasoning capabilities that proprietary models lacked. While this represents a\nsignificant step forward, the modest accuracy underscores the profound\nchallenge of the task, establishing NuRisk as a critical benchmark for\nadvancing spatio-temporal reasoning in autonomous driving.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc790\uc728\uc8fc\ud589\uc758 \uc704\ud5d8 \uc774\ud574\ub294 \ub192\uc740 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\uba70, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uc774 \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \uc704\ud5d8 \uc9c4\ud654\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ubd80\uc871\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.

Intrinsic reward based on\nuncertainty estimation or distribution similarity, while eventually escapes\nnoisy-TVs as time unfolds, suffers from poor sample efficiency and high\ncomputational cost. Inspired by recent findings from neuroscience that humans\nmonitor their improvements during exploration, we propose a novel method for\nintrinsically-motivated exploration, named Learning Progress Monitoring (LPM).\nDuring exploration, LPM rewards model improvements instead of prediction error\nor novelty, effectively rewards the agent for observing learnable transitions\nrather than the unlearnable transitions. We introduce a dual-network design\nthat uses an error model to predict the expected prediction error of the\ndynamics model in its previous iteration, and use the difference between the\nmodel errors of the current iteration and previous iteration to guide\nexploration. We theoretically show that the intrinsic reward of LPM is\nzero-equivariant and a monotone indicator of Information Gain (IG), and that\nthe error model is necessary to achieve monotonicity correspondence with IG. We\nempirically compared LPM against state-of-the-art baselines in noisy\nenvironments based on MNIST, 3D maze with 160x120 RGB inputs, and Atari.\nResults show that LPM's intrinsic reward converges faster, explores more states\nin the maze experiment, and achieves higher extrinsic reward in Atari. This\nconceptually simple approach marks a shift-of-paradigm of noise-robust\nexploration.

Existing approaches, however, often face challenges\nin balancing the capture of fine-grained details with ensuring generalizability\nbeyond training data regimes with a reasonable model complexity. In this paper,\nwe present a multi-modal \\& multi-step pipeline for effective automated model\ndiscovery. Our approach leverages two vision-language-based modules (VLM),\nAnalyzerVLM and EvaluatorVLM, for effective model proposal and evaluation in an\nagentic way. AnalyzerVLM autonomously plans and executes multi-step analyses to\npropose effective candidate models.

While Machine Learning techniques in Electronic Design Automation\n(EDA) have shown promise in reducing complexity and minimizing human\nintervention, they still face challenges such as numerous iterations and a lack\nof knowledge about AMS circuit design. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs)\nhave demonstrated significant potential across various fields, showing a\ncertain level of knowledge in circuit design and indicating their potential to\nautomate the transistor sizing process. In this work, we propose EEsizer, an\nLLM-based AI agent that integrates large language models with circuit\nsimulators and custom data analysis functions, enabling fully automated,\nclosed-loop transistor sizing without relying on external knowledge. By\nemploying prompt engineering and Chain-of-Thought reasoning, the agent\niteratively explores design directions, evaluates performance, and refines\nsolutions with minimal human intervention. We first benchmarked 8 LLMs on six\nbasic circuits and selected three high-performing models to optimize a\n20-transistor CMOS operational amplifier, targeting multiple performance\nmetrics, including rail-to-rail operation from 180 nm to 90 nm technology\nnodes. Notably, OpenAI o3 successfully achieved the user-intended target at 90\nnm across three different test groups, with a maximum of 20 iterations,\ndemonstrating adaptability and robustness at advanced nodes. To assess design\nrobustness, we manually designed a bias circuit and performed a variation\nanalysis using Gaussian-distributed variations on transistor dimensions and\nthreshold voltages.", "AI":

However, standard\nRLVR training often leads to excessively verbose processes (in reasoning tasks)\nand inefficient exploration trajectories (in agentic settings), as outcome-only\nrewards provide no incentive for efficiency and the high variance in response\nlength within relatively small rollout groups results in noisy optimization\nsignals. To address this, we propose Rollout Response Recomposition (RoRecomp),\na plug-and-play method that guides models toward concise reasoning by\nstrategically recomposing the training data. RoRecomp separates responses into\ntwo distinct batch types: 1) priority batches, which combine short-correct and\nlong-incorrect responses selected from online batches to provide a clear\ngradient signal for brevity, and 2) compensation batches, which utilize\nremaining responses from a replay buffer to maintain stability and prevent\nmodel collapse. To comprehensively evaluate effectiveness, we test RoRecomp\nacross three settings where results demonstrate substantial efficiency gains:\nreducing reasoning length by 27.7% in zero RL training, reducing unnecessary\ntool calls by 46.8% while improving accuracy in agentic RL, and achieving up to\n52.5% length reduction in thinking compression, all with minimal performance\nimpact.", "AI": {"tldr": "RoRecomp\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc804\ub7b5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uac04\uacb0\ud55c \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c, RLVR\uc758 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 RLVR \ud6c8\ub828 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uacbd\ub85c\uc640 \uacfc\ub3c4\ud55c \uc7a5\ud669\uc131\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc2e0\ud638\uc758 \ub178\uc774\uc988\ub97c \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "method": "RoRecomp\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubc30\uce58 \uc720\ud615\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ub204\uc5b4, \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uba85\ud655\ud55c \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc774\ub2e4: 1) \uc6b0\uc120 \ubc30\uce58, 2) \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubc30\uce58.", "result": "RoRecomp\ub294 3\uac00\uc9c0 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud588\uace0, \uc81c\ub85c RL \ud6c8\ub828\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd94\ub860 \uae38\uc774\ub97c 27.7% \uc904\uc774\uace0, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 RL\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd88\ud544\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c \ud638\ucd9c\uc744 46.8% \uc904\uc774\uba70 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf30\uc73c\uba70, \uc0ac\uace0 \uc555\ucd95\uc5d0\uc11c \uae38\uc774\ub97c \ucd5c\ub300 52.5% \uc904\uc774\ub294 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "RoRecomp\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud55c\uc758 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\uba74\uc11c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1\uacfc\uc758 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RLVR)\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc784\uc774 \uc785\uc99d\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ud45c\uc900 RLVR \ud6c8\ub828\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uacbd\ub85c\uc640 \uacfc\ub3c4\ud558\uac8c \uc7a5\ud669\ud55c \uacfc\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc9c0\uba70, \uacb0\uacfc\ub9cc\uc744 \uae30\uc900\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc774 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Rollout Response Recomposition(RoRecomp)\ub77c\ub294 \ud50c\ub7ec\uadf8 \uc564 \ud50c\ub808\uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

Specifically, CURE employs a lightweight\ncorrector that is applied to the original model to verify whether outputs\ncontain target knowledge and to rewrite them if any leakage is detected. To\nefficiently handle large-scale unlearning requests, CURE retrieves unlearning\ntargets that are relevant to the initial response and provides them as\nin-context references to the corrector for detection and conditional revision.\nBy leveraging this retrieval augmentation, the corrector can adapt to new\nunlearning requests without additional training. Extensive evaluations\ndemonstrate that CURE substantially reduces information leakage, even from\nindirect queries where prior works fall short, while maintaining response\nquality and general utility. Moreover, it demonstrates robustness under\ncontinual unlearning scenarios, making it practical for real-world\napplications.", "AI": {"tldr": "CURE\ub294 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4 \uc720\ucd9c\uc744 \ubc29\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ube44\ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \ubaa8\ub378 \ucd9c\ub825 \uac80\uc99d \ubc0f \uc548\uc804\ud55c \uc751\ub2f5\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc6f9 \uaddc\ubaa8\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc554\uae30\ud558\uace0 \ub178\ucd9c\ud560 \uc704\ud5d8\uc774 \uc788\uc5b4 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ube44\ud559\uc2b5\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "CURE\ub294 \uacbd\ub7c9 \uad50\uc815\uae30\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378 \ucd9c\ub825\uc774 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294\uc9c0 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uace0, \uc720\ucd9c\uc774 \uac10\uc9c0\ub418\uba74 \uc774\ub97c \uc218\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ube44\ud559\uc2b5 \uc694\uccad\uc744 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ucd08\uae30 \uc751\ub2f5\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ub41c \ube44\ud559\uc2b5 \ub300\uc0c1\ub4e4\uc744 \uac80\uc0c9\ud558\uc5ec \uad50\uc815\uae30\uc5d0 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc5ec \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ubc0f \uc870\uac74\ubd80 \uc218\uc815\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "CURE\ub294 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4 \uc720\ucd9c\uc744 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \uc904\uc774\uba70, \uc751\ub2f5 \ud488\uc9c8\uacfc \uc77c\ubc18 \uc720\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "CURE\ub294 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ube44\ud559\uc2b5 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5b4 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc751\uc6a9\uc5d0 \uc801\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6f9 \uaddc\ubaa8\uc758 \ub9d0\ubb49\uce58\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uae30\uc5b5\ud558\uace0 \ub178\ucd9c\ud560 \uc704\ud5d8\uc774 \uc788\uc5b4 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uae30\uacc4 \ube44\ud559\uc2b5\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uc804 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \uc5b5\uc81c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc785\ub825 \ucffc\ub9ac\uc5d0 \uc8fc\ub85c \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub294 \uc885\uc885 \uae30\ubcf8 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uac70\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc2e4\ud328\ud558\uace0 \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378 \ucd9c\ub825\uc758 \uc720\ucd9c \uc5ec\ubd80\ub97c \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uace0 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \uc751\ub2f5\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ube44\ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Corrective Unlearning with Retrieved Exclusions (CURE)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, CURE\ub294 \uacbd\ub7c9 \uad50\uc815\uae30\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc6d0\ub798 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uace0 \ucd9c\ub825\uc774 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294\uc9c0 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uba70 \uc720\ucd9c\uc774 \uac10\uc9c0\ub418\uba74 \uc774\ub97c \uc218\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ube44\ud559\uc2b5 \uc694\uccad\uc744 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 CURE\ub294 \ucd08\uae30 \uc751\ub2f5\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ub41c \ube44\ud559\uc2b5 \ub300\uc0c1\uc744 \uac80\uc0c9\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \uad50\uc815\uae30\uc5d0 \uc778\ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ucc38\uc870\ub85c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc5ec \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ubc0f \uc870\uac74\ubd80 \uc218\uc815\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uac80\uc0c9 \ubcf4\uac15\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uad50\uc815\uae30\ub294 \ucd94\uac00 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ube44\ud559\uc2b5 \uc694\uccad\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0 \ub530\ub974\uba74 CURE\ub294 \uc774\uc804 \uc791\uc5c5\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud55c \uac04\uc811 \ucffc\ub9ac\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc720\ucd9c\uc744 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \uc904\uc774\uba70 \uc751\ub2f5 \ud488\uc9c8\uacfc \uc77c\ubc18 \uc720\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub354\uc6b1\uc774, CURE\ub294 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ube44\ud559\uc2b5 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5b4 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc751\uc6a9\uc5d0 \uc801\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

EMP does not prescribe how to score the parameters or prune\nthe models; instead, it supplies a universal adaptive threshold that can be\napplied to any pruning criterion: weight magnitude, attention score, KAN\nimportance score, or even feature-level signals such as image pixel, and used\non structural parts or weights of the models. Given any score vector s, EMP\nmaps s to a built-in effective number N_eff which is inspired by the Inverse\nSimpson index of contributors. Retaining the N_eff highest scoring entries and\nzeroing the remainder yields sparse models with performance comparable to the\noriginal dense networks across MLPs, CNNs, Transformers/LLMs, and KAN, in our\nexperiments. By leveraging the geometry of the simplex, we derive a tight lower\nbound on the preserved mass s_eff (the sum of retained scores) over the\ncorresponding ordered probability simplex associated with the score vector s.\nWe further verify the effectiveness of N_eff by pruning the model with a scaled\nthreshold \\b{eta}*N_eff across a variety of criteria and models. Experiments\nsuggest that the default \\b{eta} = 1 yields a robust threshold for model\npruning while \\b{eta} not equal to 1 still serves as an optional adjustment to\nmeet specific sparsity requirements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud504\ub8e8\ub2dd(EMP)\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uaddc\uce59\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud504\ub8e8\ub2dd \ud560 \ub54c \uc5bc\ub9c8\ub098 \ub9ce\uc740 \ud56d\ubaa9\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd98\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubaa8\ub378 \ud504\ub8e8\ub2dd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5bc\ub9c8\ub098 \ub9ce\uc740 \ud56d\ubaa9\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uacb0\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc9c8\ubb38\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "EMP\ub294 \uc5b4\ub5a4 \ud504\ub8e8\ub2dd \uae30\uc900\uc5d0\ub3c4 \uc801\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubcf4\ud3b8\uc801\uc774\uba70 \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc778 \uc784\uacc4\uac12\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc810\uc218 \ubca1\ud130\ub97c N_eff\ub85c \ub9e4\ud551\ud558\uc5ec \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "N_eff \ub192\uc740 \uc810\uc218 \ud56d\ubaa9\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \ub098\uba38\uc9c0\ub97c \uc81c\ub85c\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc \uc6d0\ub798\uc758 \ubc00\uc9d1 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc640 \ube44\uad50\ud574\ub3c4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \ud76c\uc18c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub514\ud3f4\ud2b8 \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \b{eta} = 1\uc774 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud504\ub8e8\ub2dd\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc784\uacc4\uac12\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \ub2e4\ub978 \uac12\uc740 \ud2b9\uc815 \ud76c\uc18c\uc131 \uc694\uad6c\ub97c \ucda9\uc871\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc120\ud0dd\uc801 \uc870\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud504\ub8e8\ub2dd(EMP)\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ubb38\ub9e5\uc5d0 \uad6c\uc560\ubc1b\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \uaddc\uce59\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ud504\ub8e8\ub2dd\uc758 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc778 \uc5bc\ub9c8\ub098 \ub9ce\uc740 \ud56d\ubaa9\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud560\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.

While recent developments have incorporated\ndiscriminative, hierarchical, or generative structures, most approaches rely on\nencouraging representation sparsity over individual samples that overlook how\natoms are shared across samples, resulting in redundant and sub-optimal\ndictionaries. We introduce a parsimony promoting regularizer based on the\nrow-wise $L_\\infty$ norm of the coefficient matrix. This additional penalty\nencourages entire rows of the coefficient matrix to vanish, thereby reducing\nthe number of dictionary atoms activated across the dataset.

However,\nexisting static benchmarks are ill-equipped to address the dynamic nature of AI\nrisks and evolving regulations, creating a critical safety gap. This paper\nintroduces a new paradigm of agentic safety evaluation, reframing evaluation as\na continuous and self-evolving process rather than a one-time audit. We then\npropose a novel multi-agent framework SafeEvalAgent, which autonomously ingests\nunstructured policy documents to generate and perpetually evolve a\ncomprehensive safety benchmark. SafeEvalAgent leverages a synergistic pipeline\nof specialized agents and incorporates a Self-evolving Evaluation loop, where\nthe system learns from evaluation results to craft progressively more\nsophisticated and targeted test cases. Our experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of SafeEvalAgent, showing a consistent decline in model safety as\nthe evaluation hardens. For instance, GPT-5's safety rate on the EU AI Act\ndrops from 72.50% to 36.36% over successive iterations.

To address\nthis, we present a practitioner-oriented field manual for deploying generative\nagents that use electronic health record (EHR) data. This guide is informed by\nour experience deploying the \"irAE-Agent\", an automated system to detect\nimmune-related adverse events from clinical notes at Mass General Brigham, and\nby structured interviews with 20 clinicians, engineers, and informatics leaders\ninvolved in the project. Our analysis reveals a critical misalignment in\nclinical AI development: less than 20% of our effort was dedicated to prompt\nengineering and model development, while over 80% was consumed by the\nsociotechnical work of implementation. We distill this effort into five \"heavy\nlifts\": data integration, model validation, ensuring economic value, managing\nsystem drift, and governance. By providing actionable solutions for each of\nthese challenges, this field manual shifts the focus from algorithmic\ndevelopment to the essential infrastructure and implementation work required to\nbridge the \"valley of death\" and successfully translate generative AI from\npilot projects into routine clinical care.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uc758\ub8cc \ud601\uc2e0\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \uc2e4\uc81c \uc784\uc0c1 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uad6c\ud604\uc774 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8ec\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc758\ub8cc \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c LLMs\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uc2e4\ud604\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uac00\uc774\ub4dc\ub77c\uc778 \uc81c\uacf5.", "method": "\uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc778\ud130\ubdf0\uc640 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ubc30\ud3ec \uacbd\ud5d8\uc744 \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \ud544\ub4dc \ub9e4\ub274\uc5bc \uc791\uc131.", "result": "\uc784\uc0c1 AI \uac1c\ubc1c\uc5d0\uc11c 20% \ubbf8\ub9cc\uc774 \ubaa8\ub378 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc5d0, 80% \uc774\uc0c1\uc774 \uad6c\ud604 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uc18c\uc694\ub428\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d.", "conclusion": "\uc784\uc0c1 \uce58\ub8cc\uc5d0 AI\ub97c \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc778 \uc778\ud504\ub77c\uc640 \uad6c\ud604 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd98\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc774 \ud1b5\ud569\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub294 \uc758\ub8cc \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5c4\uccad\ub09c \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc784\uc0c1 \ud658\uacbd \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\ub4e4\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uacfc \uc2e4\uc81c \uad6c\ud604 \uc0ac\uc774\uc5d0\ub294 \ud070 \uaca9\ucc28\uac00 \uc874\uc7ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc804\uc790 \uac74\uac15 \uae30\ub85d(EHR) \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ubc30\uce58\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ubb34\uc790 \uc9c0\ud5a5\uc758 \ud544\ub4dc \ub9e4\ub274\uc5bc\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uac00\uc774\ub4dc\ub294 \ub9e4\uc2a4 \uc81c\ub108\ub7f4 \ube0c\ub9ac\uac10\uc5d0\uc11c \uc784\uc0c1 \ub178\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uba74\uc5ed \uad00\ub828 \ubd80\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uac10\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc778 'irAE-Agent'\ub97c \ubc30\ud3ec\ud55c \uacbd\ud5d8\uacfc \ud504\ub85c\uc81d\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ucc38\uc5ec\ud55c 20\uba85\uc758 \uc784\uc0c1\uc758, \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4, \uc815\ubcf4\ud559 \ub9ac\ub354\uc640\uc758 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc778\ud130\ubdf0\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubd84\uc11d\uc740 \uc784\uc0c1 AI \uac1c\ubc1c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub97c \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ub178\ub825 \uc911 20% \ubbf8\ub9cc\uc774 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uacf5\ud559\uacfc \ubaa8\ub378 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc5d0 \ud560\uc560\ub418\uc5c8\uace0, 80% \uc774\uc0c1\uc774 \uad6c\ud604\uc758 \uc0ac\ud68c\uae30\uc220\uc801 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uc18c\ubaa8\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \ub178\ub825\uc744 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud1b5\ud569, \ubaa8\ub378 \uac80\uc99d, \uacbd\uc81c\uc801 \uac00\uce58 \ud655\ubcf4, \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ub4dc\ub9ac\ud504\ud2b8 \uad00\ub9ac, \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4\uc758 \ub2e4\uc12f \uac00\uc9c0 '\uc911\ub7c9 \uc791\uc5c5'\uc73c\ub85c \uc555\ucd95\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uac01 \ub3c4\uc804\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368, \uc774 \ud544\ub4dc \ub9e4\ub274\uc5bc\uc740 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud544\uc218 \uc778\ud504\ub77c\uc640 \uad6c\ud604 \uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \uc804\ud658\ud558\uc5ec '\uc8fd\uc74c\uc758 \uace8\uc9dc\uae30'\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uace0 \uc0dd\uc131 AI\ub97c \ud30c\uc77c\ub7ff \ud504\ub85c\uc81d\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \uc784\uc0c1 \uce58\ub8cc\ub85c \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\uc774\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ub3d5\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Recently, researchers have begun to\nexplore automated game development. However, existing approaches face three\nprimary challenges: (1) limited scope to 2D content generation or isolated code\nsnippets; (2) requirement for manual integration of generated components into\ngame engines; and (3) poor performance on handling interactive game logic and\nstate management. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate\npotential capabilities to ease the game generation task, a critical gap still\nremains in translating these outputs into production-ready, executable game\nprojects based on game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine.\n  To bridge the gap, this paper introduces UniGen, the first end-to-end\ncoordinated multi-agent framework that automates zero-coding development of\nrunnable 3D games from natural language requirements. Specifically, UniGen uses\na Planning Agent that interprets user requirements into structured blueprints\nand engineered logic descriptions; after which a Generation Agent produces\nexecutable C# scripts; then an Automation Agent handles engine-specific\ncomponent binding and scene construction; and lastly a Debugging Agent provides\nreal-time error correction through conversational interaction. We evaluated\nUniGen on three distinct game prototypes. Results demonstrate that UniGen not\nonly democratizes game creation by requiring no coding from the user, but also\nreduces development time by 91.4%.

Beyond the spurious dependencies induced by\nlatent confounders, we highlight a common yet often overlooked challenge in the\nproblem due to post-treatment selection, in which samples are selectively\nincluded in datasets after interventions. This fundamental challenge widely\nexists in biological studies; for example, in gene expression analysis, both\nobservational and interventional samples are retained only if they meet quality\ncontrol criteria (e.g., highly active cells). Neglecting post-treatment\nselection may introduce spurious dependencies and distributional changes under\ninterventions, which can mimic causal responses, thereby distorting causal\ndiscovery results and challenging existing causal formulations. To address\nthis, we introduce a novel causal formulation that explicitly models\npost-treatment selection and reveals how its differential reactions to\ninterventions can distinguish causal relations from selection patterns,\nallowing us to go beyond traditional equivalence classes toward the underlying\ntrue causal structure. We then characterize its Markov properties and propose a\nFine-grained Interventional equivalence class, named FI-Markov equivalence,\nrepresented by a new graphical diagram, F-PAG. Finally, we develop a provably\nsound and complete algorithm, F-FCI, to identify causal relations, latent\nconfounders, and post-treatment selection up to $\\mathcal{FI}$-Markov\nequivalence, using both observational and interventional data. Experimental\nresults on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method\nrecovers causal relations despite the presence of both selection and latent\nconfounders.", "AI": {"tldr":

Recently, their use as independently reasoning agents has been\nproposed. In this work, we test the potential of such agents for knowledge\ndiscovery in materials science. We repurpose LangGraph's tool functionality to\nsupply agents with a black box function to interrogate. In contrast to process\noptimization or performing specific, user-defined tasks, knowledge discovery\nconsists of freely exploring the system, posing and verifying statements about\nthe behavior of this black box, with the sole objective of generating and\nverifying generalizable statements. We provide proof of concept for this\napproach through a children's parlor game, demonstrating the role of\ntrial-and-error and persistence in knowledge discovery, and the strong\npath-dependence of results. We then apply the same strategy to show that LLM\nagents can explore, discover, and exploit diverse chemical interactions in an\nadvanced Atomic Layer Processing reactor simulation using intentionally limited\nprobe capabilities without explicit instructions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c \uc9c0\uc2dd \ubc1c\uacac \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc2dc\ud5d8\ud568.", "motivation": "\uc790\uc728\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c\uc11c\uc758 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825 \uac80\ud1a0.", "method": "LangGraph\uc758 \ub3c4\uad6c \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \uc9c8\uc758\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud568.", "result": "\uc9c0\uc2dd \ubc1c\uacac\uc758 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\ub294 \uc5b4\ub9b0\uc774 \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uac1c\ub150 \uc99d\uba85.", "conclusion": "LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ud504\ub85c\ube0c \uae30\ub2a5\uc73c\ub85c \ud654\ud559 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud0d0\uc0c9, \ubc1c\uacac, \ud65c\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud568.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ud574\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc8fc\ubaa9\uc744 \ubc1b\uc544\uc654\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc\uc5d0\ub294 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\ub860\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c\uc11c\uc758 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc774 \uc81c\uc548\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc7ac\ub8cc \uacfc\ud559\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc9c0\uc2dd \ubc1c\uacac \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc2dc\ud5d8\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc9c8\uc758\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 LangGraph\uc758 \ub3c4\uad6c \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacf5\uc815 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub098 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc815\uc758 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc218\ud589\uacfc\ub294 \ub2ec\ub9ac, \uc9c0\uc2dd \ubc1c\uacac\uc740 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc790\uc720\ub86d\uac8c \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\uace0 \uc774 \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc9c4\uc220\uc744 \uc81c\uae30\ud558\uace0 \uac80\uc99d\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc9c4\uc220\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5b4\ub9b0\uc774 \uc624\ub77d \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \uac1c\ub150 \uc99d\uba85\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uc9c0\uc2dd \ubc1c\uacac\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\ud5d8\uacfc \uc624\ub958 \ubc0f \ub048\uae30\uc758 \uc5ed\ud560\uacfc \uacb0\uacfc\uc758 \uac15\ud55c \uacbd\ub85c \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7f0 \ub2e4\uc74c, \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc778 \uc9c0\uc2dc \uc5c6\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ud504\ub85c\ube0c \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uace0\uae09 \uc6d0\uc790\uce35 \ucc98\ub9ac \ubc18\uc751\uae30 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud654\ud559 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud0d0\uc0c9, \ubc1c\uacac \ubc0f \ud65c\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Each causal process models the time course of a\nstochastic cause-effect relation. We learn these world models from limited data\nvia variational Bayesian inference combined with LLM proposals. Across five\nsimulated tabletop robotics environments, the learned models enable fast\nplanning that generalizes to held-out tasks with more objects and more complex\ngoals, outperforming a range of baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc7a5\uae30 \uacc4\ud68d\uc5d0\uc11c \uc678\ubd80 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\uc640 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc774 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uc9c4\ud589\ub428\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud55c \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc7a5\uae30 \uacc4\ud68d \uc218\ud589 \uc2dc \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9 \ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uc678\ubd80 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub4e4\uc774 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc774\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc0c1\uc9d5\uc801 \uc0c1\ud0dc \ud45c\ud604\uacfc \ub0b4\uc7ac\uc801 \ubc0f \uc678\uc7ac\uc801 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc778\uacfc \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \ucd94\uc0c1\uc801 \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \ubcc0\ubd84 \ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \ucd94\ub860\uacfc LLM \uc81c\uc548\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub2e4\uc12f \uac00\uc9c0 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ud14c\uc774\ube14\ud0d1 \ub85c\ubcf4\ud2f1\uc2a4 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc740 \uac1d\uccb4\uc640 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uac16\ucd98 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacfc\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub41c \ube60\ub978 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \uc5ec\ub7ec \uae30\uc900\uc120\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uacfc \uc678\ubd80 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc7a5\uae30 \uc9c0\ud5a5\uc758 \uccb4\ud604 \uacc4\ud68d\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uc678\ubd80 \uacfc\uc815(\uc608: \ubb3c\uc774 \uac00\uc5f4\ub418\uac70\ub098 \ub3c4\ubbf8\ub178\uac00 \uc5f0\uc1c4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc4f0\ub7ec\uc9c0\ub294 \ud604\uc0c1)\uacfc \ud568\uaed8 \uc9c4\ud589\ub418\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 (i) \uc0c1\uc9d5\uc801 \uc0c1\ud0dc \ud45c\ud604\uacfc (ii) \ub0b4\uc7ac\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9 \ubc0f \uc678\uc7ac\uc801 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc758 \uc778\uacfc \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uacf5\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \ucd94\uc0c1\uc801 \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uac01 \uc778\uacfc \uacfc\uc815\uc740 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uc6d0\uc778-\uacb0\uacfc \uad00\uacc4\uc758 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \uc9c4\ud589\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 LLM \uc81c\uc548\uacfc \uacb0\ud569\ub41c \ubcc0\ubd84 \ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc12f \uac1c\uc758 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ud14c\uc774\ube14\ud0d1 \ub85c\ubcf4\ud2f1\uc2a4 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc740 \uac1d\uccb4\uc640 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacfc\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub41c \ube60\ub978 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \uc5ec\ub7ec \uae30\uc900\uc120\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

Although the QSBP is known in the\nmathematical literature, we formulate it here from a Lagrangian perspective and\nderive its main features in a way that is particularly suited to generative\nmodeling. We show that the resulting evolution equations involve the so-called\nBohm (quantum) potential, representing a notion of non-locality in the\nstochastic process. This distinguishes the QSBP from classical stochastic\ndynamics and reflects a key characteristic typical of quantum mechanical\nsystems. In this work, we derive exact closed-form solutions for the QSBP\nbetween Gaussian distributions. Our derivation is based on solving the\nFokker-Planck Equation (FPE) and the Hamilton-Jacobi Equation (HJE) arising\nfrom the Lagrangian formulation of dynamical Optimal Transport. We find that,\nsimilar to the classical Schr\\\"odinger Bridge Problem, the solution to the QSBP\nbetween Gaussians is again a Gaussian process; however, the evolution of the\ncovariance differs due to quantum effects.

To investigate whether multi-agent\ninteraction can enhance LLMs' independent problem-solving ability, we introduce\nILR, a novel co-learning framework for MAS that integrates two key components:\nDynamic Interaction and Perception Calibration. Specifically, Dynamic\nInteraction first adaptively selects either cooperative or competitive\nstrategies depending on question difficulty and model ability. LLMs then\nexchange information through Idea3 (Idea Sharing, Idea Analysis, and Idea\nFusion), an innovative interaction paradigm designed to mimic human discussion,\nbefore deriving their respective final answers. In Perception Calibration, ILR\nemploys Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to train LLMs while\nintegrating one LLM's reward distribution characteristics into another's reward\nfunction, thereby enhancing the cohesion of multi-agent interactions. We\nvalidate ILR on three LLMs across two model families of varying scales,\nevaluating performance on five mathematical benchmarks and one coding\nbenchmark. Experimental results show that ILR consistently outperforms\nsingle-agent learning, yielding an improvement of up to 5% over the strongest\nbaseline. We further discover that Idea3 can enhance the robustness of stronger\nLLMs during multi-agent inference, and dynamic interaction types can boost\nmulti-agent learning compared to pure cooperative or

Asymmetric\nactor-critic methods leverage privileged information during training to improve\nlearning under these conditions. However, existing approaches typically assume\nfull-state access during training. In this work, we challenge this assumption\nby proposing a novel actor-critic framework, called informed asymmetric\nactor-critic, that enables conditioning the critic on arbitrary privileged\nsignals without requiring access to the full state. We show that policy\ngradients remain unbiased under this formulation, extending the theoretical\nfoundation of asymmetric methods to the more general case of privileged partial\ninformation. To quantify the impact of such signals, we propose informativeness\nmeasures based on kernel methods and return prediction error, providing\npractical tools for evaluating training-time signals. We validate our approach\nempirically on benchmark navigation tasks and synthetic partially observable\nenvironments, showing that our informed asymmetric method improves learning\nefficiency and value estimation when informative privileged inputs are\navailable. Our findings challenge the necessity of full-state access and open\nnew directions for designing asymmetric reinforcement learning methods that are\nboth practical and theoretically sound.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ube44\ub300\uce6d \uc561\ud130-\ud06c\ub9ac\ud2f1 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ubd88\uc644\uc804\ud55c \uad00\ucc30\ud558\uc758 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub86d\uace0 \ud601\uc2e0\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubd80\ubd84 \uad00\uce21 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ud558\uc5d0 \ud589\ub3d9\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ube44\ub300\uce6d \uc561\ud130-\ud06c\ub9ac\ud2f1 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ube44\ub300\uce6d \uc561\ud130-\ud06c\ub9ac\ud2f1\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc804\uccb4 \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc811\uadfc \uc5c6\uc774 \uc784\uc758\uc758 \ud2b9\uad8c \uc2e0\ud638\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ube44\ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc870\uac74\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc815\ucc45 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30\uac00 \uc774 \uad6c\uc870 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \ud3b8\ud5a5\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec \uc8fc\uba70, \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ud2b9\uad8c \ubd80\ubd84 \uc815\ubcf4\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0\ub85c \ube44\ub300\uce6d \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \ud655\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc815\ubcf4\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \ud2b9\uad8c \uc785\ub825\uc774 \uc81c\uacf5\ub420 \ub54c, \uc81c\uc548\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uac00\uce58 \ucd94\uc815\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud568\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubd80\ubd84 \uad00\uce21 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ubd88\uc644\uc804\ud55c \uad00\ucc30\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \ud589\ub3d9\ud574\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ube44\ub300\uce6d \uc561\ud130-\ud06c\ub9ac\ud2f1 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc870\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc911\uc5d0 \ud2b9\uad8c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828 \uc911 \uc804\uccb4 \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc811\uadfc\uc744 \uac00\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc804\uccb4 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \uc5c6\uc774 \uc784\uc758\uc758 \ud2b9\uad8c \uc2e0\ud638\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ube44\ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc870\uac74\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ube44\ub300\uce6d \uc561\ud130-\ud06c\ub9ac\ud2f1 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ube44\ub300\uce6d \uc561\ud130-\ud06c\ub9ac\ud2f1\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 \uac00\uc815\uc744 \ub3c4\uc804\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc815\ucc45 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30\uac00 \uc774 \uad6c\uc870 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \ud3b8\ud5a5\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec \uc8fc\uba70, \ud2b9\uad8c \ubd80\ubd84 \uc815\ubcf4\uc758 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uacbd\uc6b0\ub85c \ube44\ub300\uce6d \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \ud655\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc2e0\ud638\uc758 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ucee4\ub110 \ubc29\ubc95 \ubc0f \ubc18\ud658 \uc608\uce21 \uc624\ucc28\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uc815\ubcf4\uc131 \uce21\uc815\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \ud6c8\ub828 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uc791\uc5c5\uacfc \ud569\uc131 \ubd80\ubd84 \uad00\uce21 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc815\ubcf4\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \ud2b9\uad8c \uc785\ub825\uc774 \uc81c\uacf5\ub420 \uacbd\uc6b0 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc815\ubcf4 \ube44\ub300\uce6d \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uac00\uce58 \ucd94\uc815\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc1c\uacac\uc740 \uc804\uccb4 \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc811\uadfc\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc5d0 \ub3c4\uc804\ud558\uba70, \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud0c0\ub2f9\ud55c \ube44\ub300\uce6d \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\ubc95 \uc124\uacc4\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \uc5f4\uc5b4\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Under Review", "summary": "Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled a new class of\nself-evolving agents that autonomously improve through interaction with the\nenvironment, demonstrating strong capabilities. However, self-evolution also\nintroduces novel risks overlooked by current safety research. In this work, we\nstudy the case where an agent's self-evolution deviates in unintended ways,\nleading to undesirable or even harmful outcomes. We refer to this as\nMisevolution. To provide a systematic investigation, we evaluate misevolution\nalong four key evolutionary pathways: model, memory, tool, and workflow. Our\nempirical findings reveal that misevolution is a widespread risk, affecting\nagents built even on top-tier LLMs (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Pro). Different emergent\nrisks are observed in the self-evolutionary process, such as the degradation of\nsafety alignment after memory accumulation, or the unintended introduction of\nvulnerabilities in tool creation and reuse. To our knowledge, this is the first\nstudy to systematically conceptualize misevolution and provide empirical\nevidence of its occurrence, highlighting an urgent need for new safety\nparadigms for self-evolving agents. Finally, we discuss potential mitigation\nstrategies to inspire further research on building safer and more trustworthy\nself-evolving agents.

Prior work often addresses\nthis by predicting future model weights. However, full model prediction is\nprohibitively expensive for even reasonably sized models. Thus, recent methods\nonly predict the classifier layer, limiting generalization by failing to adjust\nother model components. To address this, we propose Temporal Experts Averaging\n(TEA), a novel and scalable TDG framework that updates the entire model using\nweight averaging to maximize generalization potential while minimizing\ncomputational costs. Our theoretical analysis guides us to two steps that\nenhance generalization to future domains. First, we create expert models with\nfunctional diversity yet parameter similarity by fine-tuning a domain-agnostic\nbase model on individual temporal domains while constraining weight changes.\nSecond, we optimize the bias-variance tradeoff through adaptive averaging\ncoefficients derived from modeling temporal weight trajectories in a principal\ncomponent subspace. Expert's contributions are based on their projected\nproximity to future domains. Extensive experiments across 7 TDG benchmarks, 5\nmodels, and 2 TDG settings shows TEA outperforms prior TDG methods by up to 69%\nwhile being up to 60x more efficient.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc2dc\uac04 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654(TDG)\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Temporal Experts Averaging(TEA)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "TDG\ub294 \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \ubd84\ud3ec \ubcc0\ud654, \uc608\ub97c \ub4e4\uc5b4, \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \uc5b4\ud718 \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "TDG\ub294 \uc804\uccb4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uac00\uc911\uce58 \ud3c9\uade0\ud654\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 TEA\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "7\uac1c TDG \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c, 5\uac1c \ubaa8\ub378 \ubc0f 2\uac1c TDG \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 TEA\uac00 \uc774\uc804 TDG \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ucd5c\ub300 69% \ub354 \uc6b0\uc218\ud558\uace0 \ucd5c\ub300 60\ubc30 \ub354 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "TEA\ub294 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c, \uc55e\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \ud06c\uac8c \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc2dc\uac04 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654(TDG)\ub294 \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \ubd84\ud3ec \ubcc0\ud654, \uc608\ub97c \ub4e4\uc5b4, \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \uc5b4\ud718 \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uc804 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc885\uc885 \ubbf8\ub798 \ubaa8\ub378 \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub97c \uc608\uce21\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc774\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc804\uccb4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc608\uce21\uc740 \uc801\ub2f9\ud55c \ud06c\uae30\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574\uc11c\ub3c4 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \uacfc\uc911\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \ucd5c\uadfc \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ubd84\ub958\uae30 \uacc4\uce35\ub9cc \uc608\uce21\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\ub978 \ubaa8\ub378 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \uc870\uc815\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud574 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\uac00 \uc81c\ud55c\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac00\uc911\uce58 \ud3c9\uade0\ud654\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc804\uccb4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c TDG \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Temporal Experts Averaging (TEA)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ubd84\uc11d\uc740 \ubbf8\ub798 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\ud558\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub97c \uc548\ub0b4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uccab\uc9f8, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac00\uc911\uce58 \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \uc81c\uc57d\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uac1c\ubcc4 \uc2dc\uac04 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ubd88\uac00\uc9c0\ub860\uc801 \uae30\ubcf8 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\ub2a5\uc801 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131 \ubc0f \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub458\uc9f8, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc8fc\uc131\ubd84 \uc11c\ube0c\uc2a4\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\uac04 \uac00\uc911\uce58 \uada4\uc801 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ub41c \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ud3c9\uade0 \uacc4\uc218\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud3b8\ud5a5-\ubd84\uc0b0 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc758 \uae30\uc5ec\ub294 \ubbf8\ub798 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc608\uc0c1 \uadfc\uc811\uc131\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. 7\uac1c TDG \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c, 5\uac1c \ubaa8\ub378 \ubc0f 2\uac1c TDG \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 TEA\uac00 \uc774\uc804 TDG \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ucd5c\ub300 69% \ub354 \uc6b0\uc218\ud558\uace0 \ucd5c\ub300 60\ubc30 \ub354 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Here's the cleaned version with all problematic characters replaced:\nBreast magnetic resonance imaging is a critical tool for cancer detection and\ntreatment planning, but its clinical utility is hindered by poor specificity,\nleading to high false-positive rates and unnecessary biopsies. This study\nintroduces a transformer-based framework for automated classification of breast\nlesions in dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, addressing the challenge of\ndistinguishing benign from malignant findings. We implemented a SegFormer\narchitecture that achieved an AUC of 0.92 for lesion-level classification, with\n100% sensitivity and 67% specificity at the patient level - potentially\neliminating one-third of unnecessary biopsies without missing malignancies. The\nmodel quantifies malignant pixel distribution via semantic segmentation,\nproducing interpretable spatial predictions that support clinical\ndecision-making. To establish reproducible benchmarks, we curated\nBreastDCEDL_AMBL by transforming The Cancer Imaging Archive's AMBL collection\ninto a standardized deep learning dataset with 88 patients and 133 annotated\nlesions (89 benign, 44 malignant). This resource addresses a key infrastructure\ngap, as existing public datasets lack benign lesion annotations, limiting\nbenign-malignant classification research. Training incorporated an expanded\ncohort of over 1,200 patients through integration with BreastDCEDL datasets,\nvalidating transfer learning approaches despite primary tumor-only annotations.\nPublic

Our approach integrates knowledge graphs and NLP models\nto support this analysis by semantically enriching data collected from\nsuspects' mobile phones, and help prosecutors and investigators search into the\ndata and get valuable insights. Our semantic enrichment process involves\nextracting message data and modeling it using a knowledge graph, generating\ntranscriptions of voice messages, and annotating the data using an end-to-end\nentity extraction approach. We adopt two different solutions to help users get\ninsights into the data, one based on querying and visualizing the graph, and\none based on semantic search. The proposed approach ensures that users can\nverify the information by accessing the original data. While we report about\nearly results and prototypes developed in the context of an ongoing project,\nour proposal has undergone practical applications with real investigation data.\nAs a consequence, we had the chance to interact closely with prosecutors,\ncollecting positive feedback but also identifying interesting opportunities as\nwell as promising research directions to share with the research community.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ubc94\uc8c4 \uc218\uc0ac\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\ud2b8 \uba54\uc2dc\uc9d5 \uc571\uc758 \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc640 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \ucc98\ub9ac \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubc94\uc8c4 \uc218\uc0ac\uc5d0\uc11c \ube60\ub974\uac8c \ub9ce\uc740 \uc591\uc758 \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \ud07d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc9c0\uc2dd \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1, \uc74c\uc131 \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0\uc758 \uc804\uc0ac \uc0dd\uc131, \uc5d4\ud2f0\ud2f0 \ucd94\ucd9c \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc8fc\uc11d \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \uacfc\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \uc138\ubd84\ud654\ub41c \ubd84\uc11d \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc870\uc0ac \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc751\uc6a9 \uc0ac\ub840\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd08\uae30 \uacb0\uacfc\uc640 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ud0c0\uc785\uc744 \ubcf4\uace0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uac80\ucc30\uacfc\uc758 \uae34\ubc00\ud55c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uc9c4\ud589\ud558\uc5ec \uae0d\uc815\uc801\uc778 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uacfc \uc5f0\uad6c \ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubc94\uc8c4 \uc218\uc0ac\ub294 \uc885\uc885 WhatsApp\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\ud2b8 \uba54\uc2dc\uc9d5 \uc571\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uad50\ud658\ub41c \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ub9ce\uc740 \ub178\ub825\uc744 \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5\uc774 \ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud53c\uc758\uc790\uc758 \ud734\ub300\ud3f0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc218\uc9d1\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud48d\ubd80\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \uac80\ucc30\uacfc \uc218\uc0ac\uad00\ub4e4\uc774 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uac80\uc0c9 \ubc0f \uadc0\uc911\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc744 \uc5bb\ub294 \ub370 \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc744 \uc8fc\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc640 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \ucc98\ub9ac(NLP) \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc801 \ud48d\ubd80\ud654 \uacfc\uc815\uc740 \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\uace0 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uba70, \uc74c\uc131 \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0\uc758 \uc804\uc0ac\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uc5d4\ub4dc \ud22c \uc5d4\ub4dc \uc5d4\ud2f0\ud2f0 \ucd94\ucd9c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc8fc\uc11d \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uac00 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc744 \uc5bb\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \ucffc\ub9ac\ud558\uace0 \uc2dc\uac01\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uacfc \uc758\ubbf8 \uac80\uc0c9\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc758 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0\ub97c \ucc44\ud0dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uac00 \uc6d0\ubcf8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \uc811\uadfc\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uac80\uc99d\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc9c4\ud589 \uc911\uc778 \ud504\ub85c\uc81d\ud2b8\uc758 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0\uc11c \uac1c\ubc1c\ub41c \ucd08\uae30 \uacb0\uacfc\uc640 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ud0c0\uc785\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ubcf4\uace0\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc81c\uc548\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc218\uc0ac \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \ud568\uaed8 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac80\ucc30\uacfc \ubc00\uc811\ud558\uac8c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud560 \uae30\ud68c\ub97c \uac00\uc84c\uc73c\uba70, \uae0d\uc815\uc801\uc778 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \uc218\uc9d1\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc5f0\uad6c \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ud2f0\uc640 \uacf5\uc720\ud560 \ud765\ubbf8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uae30\ud68c \ubc0f \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c \ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

This\npaper proposes a deep learning driven approach to proactively manage IEQ\nparameters specifically CO2 concentration, temperature, and humidity while\nbalancing building energy efficiency. Leveraging the ROBOD dataset collected\nfrom a net-zero energy academic building, we benchmark three\narchitectures--Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and\na hybrid Convolutional Neural Network LSTM (CNN-LSTM)--to forecast IEQ\nvariables across various time horizons. Our results show that GRU achieves the\nbest short-term prediction accuracy with lower computational overhead, whereas\nCNN-LSTM excels in extracting dominant features for extended forecasting\nwindows. Meanwhile, LSTM offers robust long-range temporal modeling. The\ncomparative analysis highlights that prediction reliability depends on data\nresolution, sensor placement, and fluctuating occupancy conditions. These\nfindings provide actionable insights for intelligent Building Management\nSystems (BMS) to implement predictive HVAC control, thereby reducing energy\nconsumption and enhancing occupant comfort in real-world building operations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uac74\ubb3c \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c CO2 \ub18d\ub3c4, \uc628\ub3c4 \ubc0f \uc2b5\ub3c4\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc2e4\ub0b4 \ud658\uacbd \ud488\uc9c8(IEQ) \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uc0ac\uc804\uc5d0 \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc2ec\uce35 \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc18 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2e4\ub0b4 \ud658\uacbd \ud488\uc9c8(IEQ)\ub97c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uac70\uc8fc\uc790\uc758 \uac74\uac15\uacfc \uc0dd\uc0b0\uc131\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ub0c9\ub09c\ubc29 \ubc0f \uacf5\uae30 \uc870\ud654(HVAC) \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub192\uc740 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "RODOD \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec LSTM, GRU \ubc0f CNN-LSTM\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud0b9\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc2dc\uac04 \ubc94\uc704\uc5d0\uc11c IEQ \ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uc608\uce21\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "GRU\ub294 \ub0ae\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \ucd5c\uace0\uc758 \ub2e8\uae30 \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uae30\ub85d\ud558\uba70, CNN-LSTM\uc740 \uc7a5\uae30 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc8fc\uc694 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \uc798 \ucd94\ucd9c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

While most studies and global discussions focus\non generic harms, such as models assisting users in harming themselves or\nothers, enterprises face a more fundamental concern: whether LLM-based agents\nare safe for their intended use case. To address this, we introduce operational\nsafety, defined as an LLM's ability to appropriately accept or refuse user\nqueries when tasked with a specific purpose. We further propose OffTopicEval,\nan evaluation suite and benchmark for measuring operational safety both in\ngeneral and within specific agentic use cases. Our evaluations on six model\nfamilies comprising 20 open-weight LLMs reveal that while performance varies\nacross models, all of them remain highly operationally unsafe. Even the\nstrongest models -- Qwen-3 (235B) with 77.77\\% and Mistral (24B) with 79.96\\%\n-- fall far short of reliable operational safety, while GPT models plateau in\nthe 62--73\\% range, Phi achieves only mid-level scores (48--70\\%), and Gemma\nand Llama-3 collapse to 39.53\\% and 23.84\\%, respectively. While operational\nsafety is a core model alignment issue, to suppress these failures, we propose\nprompt-based steering methods: query grounding (Q-ground) and system-prompt\ngrounding (P-ground), which substantially improve OOD refusal.

Recent\nwork has identified a distinctive dQ/dV peak above 4.0 V as a reliable\nsignature of plating onset; however, conventional methods for computing dQ/dV\nrely on finite differencing with filtering, which amplifies sensor noise and\nintroduces bias in peak location. In this paper, we propose a Gaussian Process\n(GP) framework for lithium plating detection by directly modeling the\ncharge-voltage relationship Q(V) as a stochastic process with calibrated\nuncertainty. Leveraging the property that derivatives of GPs remain GPs, we\ninfer dQ/dV analytically and probabilistically from the posterior, enabling\nrobust detection without ad hoc smoothing. The framework provides three key\nbenefits: (i) noise-aware inference with hyperparameters learned from data,\n(ii) closed-form derivatives with credible intervals for uncertainty\nquantification, and (iii) scalability to online variants suitable for embedded\nBMS. Experimental validation on Li-ion coin cells across a range of C-rates\n(0.2C-1C) and temperatures (0-40\\deg C) demonstrates that the GP-based method\nreliably detects plating peaks under low-temperature, high-rate charging, while\ncorrectly reporting no peaks in baseline cases.

SCUBA contains 300 task instances derived from real user interviews,\nspanning three primary personas, platform administrators, sales\nrepresentatives, and service agents. The tasks test a range of\nenterprise-critical abilities, including Enterprise Software UI navigation,\ndata manipulation, workflow automation, information retrieval, and\ntroubleshooting. To ensure realism, SCUBA operates in Salesforce sandbox\nenvironments with support for parallel execution and fine-grained evaluation\nmetrics to capture milestone progress. We benchmark a diverse set of agents\nunder both zero-shot and demonstration-augmented settings. We observed huge\nperformance gaps in different agent design paradigms and gaps between the\nopen-source model and the closed-source model. In the zero-shot setting,\nopen-source model powered computer-use agents that have strong performance on\nrelated benchmarks like OSWorld only have less than 5\\% success rate on SCUBA,\nwhile methods built on closed-source models can still have up to 39% task\nsuccess rate. In the demonstration-augmented settings, task success rates can\nbe improved to 50\\% while simultaneously reducing time and costs by 13% and\n16%, respectively. These findings highlight both the challenges of enterprise\ntasks automation and the promise of agentic solutions.

However, it has been recognised that if AI agents are aware\nthat they are being evaluated, such agents may deliberately hide dangerous\ncapabilities or intentionally demonstrate suboptimal performance in\nsafety-related tasks in order to be released and to avoid being deactivated or\nretrained. Such strategic deception - often known as \"sandbagging\" - threatens\nto undermine the integrity of safety evaluations. For this reason, it is of\nvalue to identify methods that enable us to distinguish behavioural patterns\nthat demonstrate a true lack of capability from behavioural patterns that are\nconsistent with sandbagging. In this paper, we develop a simple model of\nstrategic deception in sequential decision-making tasks, inspired by the\nrecently developed survival bandit framework. We demonstrate theoretically that\nthis problem induces sandbagging behaviour in optimal rational agents, and\nconstruct a statistical test to distinguish between sandbagging and\nincompetence from sequences of test scores.

While\nthese accelerators offer immense computational power, they incur high capital\nand operational costs due to frequent upgrades, dense power consumption, and\ncooling demands, making total cost of ownership (TCO) for AI datacenters a\ncritical concern for cloud providers. Unfortunately, traditional datacenter\nlifecycle management (designed for general-purpose workloads) struggles to keep\npace with AI's fast-evolving models, rising resource needs, and diverse\nhardware profiles. In this paper, we rethink the AI datacenter lifecycle scheme\nacross three stages: building, hardware refresh, and operation. We show how\ndesign choices in power, cooling, and networking provisioning impact long-term\nTCO. We also explore refresh strategies aligned with hardware trends. Finally,\nwe use operation software optimizations to reduce cost. While these\noptimizations at each stage yield benefits, unlocking the full potential\nrequires rethinking the entire lifecycle. Thus, we present a holistic lifecycle\nmanagement framework that coordinates and co-optimizes decisions across all\nthree stages, accounting for workload dynamics, hardware evolution, and system\naging. Our system reduces the TCO by up to 40\\% over traditional approaches.\nUsing our framework we provide guidelines on how to manage AI datacenter\nlifecycle for the future.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774

We propose a Wasserstein distributionally robust framework\nthat certifies worst-case group fairness over a ball of plausible test\ndistributions centered at the empirical law. Our formulation unifies common\ngroup fairness notions via a generic conditional-probability functional and\ndefines $\\varepsilon$-Wasserstein Distributional Fairness ($\\varepsilon$-WDF)\nas the audit target.

This paper addresses\nthese challenges by introducing a two-stage alignment strategy that bridges the\ngap between generic pretraining and specific EEG decoding tasks. First, we\npropose NeuroTTT: a domain-specific self-supervised fine-tuning paradigm that\naugments the foundation model with task-relevant self-supervised objectives,\naligning latent representations to important spectral, spatial, and temporal\nEEG features without requiring additional labeled data. Second, we incorporate\ntest-time training (TTT) at inference, we perform (i) self-supervised test-time\ntraining on individual unlabeled test samples and (ii) prediction entropy\nminimization (Tent), which updates only normalization statistics to continually\ncalibrate the model to each new input on the fly. Our approach, which, to our\nknowledge, is the first to unify domain-tuned self-supervision with test-time\ntraining in large-scale EEG foundation models, yields substantially improved\nrobustness and accuracy across diverse BCI tasks (imagined speech, stress\ndetection, motor imagery).

Under review", "summary": "Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) are gaining attention for their\ninherent capacity for parallel decoding, offering a compelling alternative to\nautoregressive LLMs. Among various decoding strategies, blockwise\nsemi-autoregressive (semi-AR) approaches are widely adopted due to their\nnatural support for KV caching and their favorable accuracy-speed trade-off.\nHowever, this paper identifies two fundamental limitations in the conventional\nsemi-AR decoding approach that applies a fixed block size: i) late decoding\noverhead, where the unmasking of high-confidence tokens outside the current\nblock is unnecessarily delayed, and ii) premature decoding error, where\nlow-confidence tokens inside the current block are committed too early, leading\nto incorrect tokens. This paper presents the first systematic investigation\nchallenging the fixed block size assumption in semi-AR decoding. Through a\nstatistical analysis of confidence dynamics during the denoising process, we\nidentify a volatility band (VB) region during dLLM decoding, which encodes\nlocal semantic structure and can be used to guide adaptive block sizing.\nLeveraging these insights, we introduce AdaBlock-dLLM, a training-free,\nplug-and-play scheduler that adaptively aligns block boundaries with semantic\nsteps by adjusting block size during runtime. Extensive experiments across\ndiverse benchmarks show that AdaBlock-dLLM achieves up to 5.3% accuracy\nimprovement under the same throughput budget. Beyond inference-time\noptimization, we hope our semantics-aware adaptive scheduling approach and\nconfidence-based analysis will inspire future training strategies for dLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8

These priors allow latent visual\ncapabilities to be unlocked for vision tasks with a relatively small amount of\nmultimodal data, and in some cases, to perform visual tasks without ever having\nseen an image. Through systematic analysis, we reveal that visual priors-the\nimplicit, emergent knowledge about the visual world acquired during language\npre-training-are composed of separable perception and reasoning priors with\nunique scaling trends and origins. We show that an LLM's latent visual\nreasoning ability is predominantly developed by pre-training on\nreasoning-centric data (e.g., code, math, academia) and scales progressively.\nThis reasoning prior acquired from language pre-training is transferable and\nuniversally applicable to visual reasoning. In contrast, a perception prior\nemerges more diffusely from broad corpora, and perception ability is more\nsensitive to the vision encoder and visual instruction tuning data. In\nparallel, text describing the visual world proves crucial, though its\nperformance impact saturates rapidly. Leveraging these insights, we propose a\ndata-centric recipe for pre-training vision-aware LLMs and verify it in 1T\ntoken scale pre-training. Our findings are grounded in over 100 controlled\nexperiments consuming 500,000 GPU-hours, spanning the full MLLM construction\npipeline-from LLM pre-training to visual alignment and supervised multimodal\nfine-tuning-across five model scales, a wide range of data categories and\nmixtures, and multiple adaptation setups. Along with our main findings, we\npropose and investigate several hypotheses, and introduce the Multi-Level\nExistence Bench (MLE-Bench). Together, this work provides a new way of\ndeliberately cultivating visual priors from language pre-training, paving the\nway for the next generation of multimodal LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8
