In particular, seemingly innocuous responses, when\ncomposed across interactions, can cumulatively enable adversaries to recover\nsensitive information, a phenomenon we term compositional privacy leakage. We\npresent the first systematic study of such compositional privacy leaks and\npossible mitigation methods in multi-agent LLM systems. First, we develop a\nframework that models how auxiliary knowledge and agent interactions jointly\namplify privacy risks, even when each response is benign in isolation. Next, to\nmitigate this, we propose and evaluate two defense strategies: (1)\nTheory-of-Mind defense (ToM), where defender agents infer a questioner's intent\nby anticipating how their outputs may be exploited by adversaries, and (2)\nCollaborative Consensus Defense (CoDef), where responder agents collaborate\nwith peers who vote based on a shared aggregated state to restrict sensitive\ninformation spread. Crucially, we balance our evaluation across compositions\nthat expose sensitive information and compositions that yield benign\ninferences. Our experiments quantify how these defense strategies differ in\nbalancing the privacy-utility trade-off. We find that while chain-of-thought\nalone offers limited protection to leakage (~39% sensitive blocking rate), our\nToM defense substantially improves sensitive query blocking (up to 97%) but can\nreduce benign task success. CoDef achieves the best balance, yielding the\nhighest Balanced Outcome (79.8%), highlighting the benefit of combining\nexplicit reasoning with defender collaboration. Together, our results expose a\nnew class of risks in collaborative LLM deployments and provide actionable\ninsights for designing safeguards against compositional, context-driven privacy\nleakage.",

While fine-tuning enhances performance by\ninternalizing domain knowledge, it also introduces a critical security risk:\nleakage of confidential training data to unauthorized users. These risks are\nexacerbated when LLMs are combined with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\npipelines that dynamically fetch contextual documents at inference time.\n  We demonstrate data exfiltration attacks on AI assistants where adversaries\ncan exploit current fine-tuning and RAG architectures to leak sensitive\ninformation by leveraging the lack of access control enforcement. We show that\nexisting defenses, including prompt sanitization, output filtering, system\nisolation, and training-level privacy mechanisms, are fundamentally\nprobabilistic and fail to offer robust protection against such attacks.\n  We take the position that only a deterministic and rigorous enforcement of\nfine-grained access control during both fine-tuning and RAG-based inference can\nreliably prevent the leakage of sensitive data to unauthorized recipients.\n  We introduce a framework centered on the principle that any content used in\ntraining, retrieval, or generation by an LLM is explicitly authorized for\n\\emph{all users involved in the interaction}. Our approach offers a simple yet\npowerful paradigm shift for building secure multi-user LLM systems that are\ngrounded in classical access control but adapted to the unique challenges of\nmodern AI workflows.

However, existing\nmethods predominantly focus on designing policies based on individual agent\ncharacteristics, often neglecting the interplay and mutual influence among\nagents during policy formation. To address this gap, we propose Competitive\nDiversity through Constructive Conflict (CoDiCon), a novel approach that\nincorporates competitive incentives into cooperative scenarios to encourage\npolicy exchange and foster strategic diversity among agents. Drawing\ninspiration from sociological research, which highlights the benefits of\nmoderate competition and constructive conflict in group decision-making, we\ndesign an intrinsic reward mechanism using ranking features to introduce\ncompetitive motivations. A centralized intrinsic reward module generates and\ndistributes varying reward values to agents, ensuring an effective balance\nbetween competition and cooperation.

Through\nrigorous mathematical analysis and comprehensive empirical evaluation spanning\nnegative reward training, symmetric loss functions, and post-hoc calibration\nmethods, we demonstrate this is an information-theoretic constraint, not a\nmethodological failure. Our experiments reveal universal failure patterns:\nnegative rewards produce extreme underconfidence (ECE greater than 0.8) while\ndestroying confidence diversity (std less than 0.05), symmetric losses fail to\nescape binary signal averaging, and post-hoc methods achieve calibration (ECE\nless than 0.02) only by compressing the confidence distribution. We formalize\nthis as an underspecified mapping problem where binary signals cannot\ndistinguish between different confidence levels for correct predictions: a 60\npercent confident correct answer receives identical supervision to a 90 percent\nconfident one. Crucially, our real-world validation shows 100 percent failure\nrate for all training methods across MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10, while\npost-hoc calibration's 33 percent success rate paradoxically confirms our\ntheorem by achieving calibration through transformation rather than learning.\nThis impossibility directly explains neural network hallucinations and\nestablishes why post-hoc calibration is mathematically necessary, not merely\nconvenient.

However, it suffers from a\ncoordination and scalability bottleneck as the number of agents increases. To\naddress these issues, we propose the LLM-empowered expert demonstrations\nframework for multi-agent reinforcement learning (LEED). LEED consists of two\ncomponents: a demonstration generation (DG) module and a policy optimization\n(PO) module. Specifically, the DG module leverages large language models to\ngenerate instructions for interacting with the environment, thereby producing\nhigh-quality demonstrations. The PO module adopts a decentralized training\nparadigm, where each agent utilizes the generated demonstrations to construct\nan expert policy loss, which is then integrated with its own policy loss. This\nenables each agent to effectively personalize and optimize its local policy\nbased on both expert knowledge and individual experience.

In this paper, we study this Vulnerable Agent\nIdentification (VAI) problem in large-scale multi-agent reinforcement learning\n(MARL). We frame VAI as a Hierarchical Adversarial Decentralized Mean Field\nControl (HAD-MFC), where the upper level involves an NP-hard combinatorial task\nof selecting the most vulnerable agents, and the lower level learns worst-case\nadversarial policies for these agents using mean-field MARL. The two problems\nare coupled together, making HAD-MFC difficult to solve. To solve this, we\nfirst decouple the hierarchical process by Fenchel-Rockafellar transform,\nresulting a regularized mean-field Bellman operator for upper level that\nenables independent learning at each level, thus reducing computational\ncomplexity.

However,\nexisting LMDM formulations are limited to vectorized inputs and struggle with\nhigh-dimensional tensor data due to the need for flattening, which destroys the\ndata's inherent multi-mode structure and increases computational burden. In\nthis paper, we propose a Structure-Preserving Margin Distribution Learning for\nHigh-Order Tensor Data with Low-Rank Decomposition (SPMD-LRT) that operates\ndirectly on tensor representations without vectorization. The SPMD-LRT\npreserves multi-dimensional spatial structure by incorporating first-order and\nsecond-order tensor statistics (margin mean and variance) into the objective,\nand it leverages low-rank tensor decomposition techniques including rank-1(CP),\nhigher-rank CP, and Tucker decomposition to parameterize the weight tensor. An\nalternating optimization (double-gradient descent) algorithm is developed to\nefficiently solve the SPMD-LRT, iteratively updating factor matrices and core\ntensor. This approach enables SPMD-LRT to maintain the structural information\nof high-order data while optimizing margin distribution for improved\nclassification. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets (including MNIST,\nimages and fMRI neuroimaging) demonstrate that SPMD-LRT achieves superior\nclassification accuracy compared to conventional SVM, vector-based LMDM, and\nprior tensor-based SVM extensions (Support Tensor Machines and Support Tucker\nMachines). Notably, SPMD-LRT with Tucker decomposition attains the highest\naccuracy, highlighting the benefit of structure preservation. These results\nconfirm the effectiveness and robustness of SPMD-LRT in handling\nhigh-dimensional tensor data for classification.", "AI": {"tldr": "SPMD-LRT\ub294 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \ud150\uc11c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ub958\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ubcf4\uc874\ud558\ub294 \ub9c8\uc9c4 \ubd84\ud3ec \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 LMDM\uc740 \ubca1\ud130\ud654\ub41c \uc785\ub825\uc5d0\ub9cc \uc81c\ud55c\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc73c\uba70 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \ud150\uc11c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud150\uc11c \ud45c\ud604\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c1\uc811 \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\uace0 1\ucc28 \ubc0f 2\ucc28 \ud150\uc11c \ud1b5\uacc4\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uc124\uc815\ud558\uba70, \uc800\uc21c\uc704 \ud150\uc11c \ubd84\ud574 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "SPMD-LRT\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 SVM \ubc0f \ud150\uc11c \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \ubd84\ub958 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ubcf4\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "SPMD-LRT\ub294 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \ud150\uc11c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uace0 \ub9c8\uc9c4 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uac15\ub825\ud568\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \ub9c8\uc9c4 \ubd84\ud3ec \uae30\uacc4(LMDM)\ub294 \ubd84\ub958\uae30 \uc124\uacc4\uc758 \ucd5c\uadfc \ubc1c\uc804\uc73c\ub85c, \ucd5c\uc18c \ub9c8\uc9c4(SVM\uacfc \uac19\uc74c)\ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uc804\uccb4 \ub9c8\uc9c4 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874 LMDM \uacf5\uc2dd\uc740 \ubca1\ud130\ud654\ub41c \uc785\ub825\uc5d0\ub9cc \uc81c\ud55c\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ud3c9\ud0c4\ud654\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uc5ec \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \ud150\uc11c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uace0\uc804\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubca1\ud130\ud654 \uc5c6\uc774 \ud150\uc11c \ud45c\ud604\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c1\uc811 \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\ub294 \uad6c\uc870 \ubcf4\uc874 \ub9c8\uc9c4 \ubd84\ud3ec \ud559\uc2b5(SPMD-LRT)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

We argue that current\nperformance-based definitions are inadequate because they provide no clear,\nmechanism-focused roadmap for research, and they fail to properly define the\nqualitative nature of genuine intelligence. Drawing inspiration from the human\nbrain, we propose a new paradigm that shifts the focus from external mimicry to\nthe development of foundational cognitive architectures. We define True\nIntelligence (TI) as a system characterized by six core components: embodied\nsensory fusion, core directives, dynamic schemata creation, a\nhighly-interconnected multi-expert architecture, an orchestration layer, and\nlastly, the unmeasurable quality of Interconnectedness, which we hypothesize\nresults in consciousness and a subjective experience. We propose a practical,\nfive-level taxonomy of AGI based on the number of the first five measurable\ncomponents a system exhibits. This framework provides a clear path forward with\ndevelopmental milestones that directly address the challenge of building\ngenuinely intelligent systems. We contend that once a system achieves Level-5\nAGI by implementing all five measurable components, the difference between it\nand TI remains as a purely philosophical debate. For practical purposes - and\ngiven theories indicate consciousness is an emergent byproduct of integrated,\nhigher-order cognition - we conclude that a fifth-level AGI is functionally and\npractically equivalent to TI. This work synthesizes diverse insights from\nanalytical psychology, schema theory, metacognition, modern brain architectures\nand latest works in AI to provide the first holistic, mechanism-based\ndefinition of AGI that offers a clear and actionable path for the research\ncommunity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5(AGI) \ubd84\uc57c\ub294 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \ubcf5\uc81c\uc640 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc778\uc9c0 \uacfc\uc815 \ubcf5\uc81c\ub77c\ub294 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub4e4\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ub17c\uc7c1 \uc911\uc774\ub2e4. \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \uae30\ubc18 \uc815\uc758\ub294 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \ub85c\ub4dc\ub9f5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba70, \uc9c4\uc815\ud55c \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc758 \uc9c8\uc801 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\ub300\ub85c \uc815\uc758\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc778\uac04 \ub1cc\uc5d0\uc11c \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc544 \uc678\ubd80 \ubaa8\ubc29\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\ucd08 \uc778\uc9c0 \uad6c\uc870\uc758 \uac1c\ubc1c\ub85c \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \uc62e\uae30\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc9c4\uc815\ud55c \uc9c0\ub2a5(TI)\uc740 \uc5ec\uc12f \uac00\uc9c0 \ud575\uc2ec \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub85c \uc815\uc758\ub418\uba70, AGI\ub97c \ub2e4\uc12f \uac00\uc9c0 \uce21\uc815 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c \uc218\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ubd84\ub958\ud558\ub294 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uc138\ubd84\ud654 \uccb4\uacc4\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 AGI\uc758 \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \uc815\uc758\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5(AGI)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub17c\uc7c1\uc774 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \ubaa9\ud45c(\uc778\uac04 \uac19\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5 \ubcf5\uc81c vs. \uc778\uac04 \uac19\uc740 \uc778\uc9c0 \uacfc\uc815 \ubcf5\uc81c)\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc5f4\ub824 \uc788\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc778\uac04 \ub1cc\uc5d0\uc11c \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc544 \uc678\ubd80 \ubaa8\ubc29\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\ucd08 \uc778\uc9c0 \uad6c\uc870 \uac1c\ubc1c\ub85c \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \uc804\ud658\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, a significant challenge remains: the\ndecision-making processes of these models are less interpretable compared to\ntraditional methods like differential gene expression analysis. Recently,\ntranscoders have emerged as a promising approach for extracting interpretable\ndecision circuits from large language models (LLMs).

A central component of\nthis framework is a network of Sentinel Agents, functioning as a distributed\nsecurity layer that integrates techniques such as semantic analysis via large\nlanguage models (LLMs), behavioral analytics, retrieval-augmented verification,\nand cross-agent anomaly detection. Such agents can potentially oversee\ninter-agent communications, identify potential threats, enforce privacy and\naccess controls, and maintain comprehensive audit records. Complementary to the\nidea of Sentinel Agents is the use of a Coordinator Agent. The Coordinator\nAgent supervises policy implementation, and manages agent participation. In\naddition, the Coordinator also ingests alerts from Sentinel Agents. Based on\nthese alerts, it can adapt policies, isolate or quarantine misbehaving agents,\nand contain threats to maintain the integrity of the MAS ecosystem. This\ndual-layered security approach, combining the continuous monitoring of Sentinel\nAgents with the governance functions of Coordinator Agents, supports dynamic\nand adaptive defense mechanisms against a range of threats, including prompt\ninjection, collusive agent behavior, hallucinations generated by LLMs, privacy\nbreaches, and coordinated multi-agent attacks. In addition to the architectural\ndesign, we present a simulation study where 162 synthetic attacks of different\nfamilies (prompt injection, hallucination, and data exfiltration) were injected\ninto a multi-agent conversational environment. The Sentinel Agents successfully\ndetected the attack attempts, confirming the practical feasibility of the\nproposed monitoring approach. The framework also offers enhanced system\nobservability, supports regulatory compliance, and enables policy evolution\nover time.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(MAS)\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548\uacfc \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uacfc \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud544\uc694\uc131.", "method": "\ubd84\uc0b0 \ubcf4\uc548\uce35\uc73c\ub85c\uc11c \uae30\ub2a5\ud558\ub294 Sentinel Agents \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc640 \uc815\ucc45 \uad6c\ud604 \ubc0f \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ucc38\uc5ec \uad00\ub9ac\ub97c \ub2f4\ub2f9\ud558\ub294 Coordinator Agent\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc774\uc911 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd.", "result": "162\uac1c\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud569\uc131 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c Sentinel Agents\uac00 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uacf5\uaca9 \uc2dc\ub3c4\ub97c \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\uc5ec \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uad00\ucc30 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uaddc\uc81c \uc900\uc218\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uba70 \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \uc815\ucc45 \uc9c4\ud654\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(MAS)\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf4\uc548\uacfc \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \uc911\uc559 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub294 \ubd84\uc0b0 \ubcf4\uc548 \uacc4\uce35\uc73c\ub85c \uae30\ub2a5\ud558\ub294 Sentinel Agents \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc774\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \uc758\ubbf8 \ubd84\uc11d, \ud589\ub3d9 \ubd84\uc11d, \uac80\uc0c9 \ubcf4\uac15 \uac80\uc99d \ubc0f \uad50\ucc28 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uae30\uc220\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04 \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc744 \uac10\ub3c5\ud558\uace0, \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \uc704\ud611\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uba70, \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubc0f \uc811\uadfc \uc81c\uc5b4\ub97c \uc2dc\ud589\ud558\uace0, \uc885\ud569\uc801\uc778 \uac10\uc0ac \uae30\ub85d\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Trivedi", "Jose Hernandez-Orallo"], "title": "Beyond the high score: Prosocial ability profiles of multi-agent populations", "comment": null, "summary": "The development and evaluation of social capabilities in AI agents require\ncomplex environments where competitive and cooperative behaviours naturally\nemerge. While game-theoretic properties can explain why certain teams or agent\npopulations outperform others, more abstract behaviours, such as convention\nfollowing, are harder to control in training and evaluation settings. The\nMelting Pot contest is a social AI evaluation suite designed to assess the\ncooperation capabilities of AI systems. In this paper, we apply a Bayesian\napproach known as Measurement Layouts to infer the capability profiles of\nmulti-agent systems in the Melting Pot contest. We show that these capability\nprofiles not only predict future performance within the Melting Pot suite but\nalso reveal the underlying prosocial abilities of agents. Our analysis\nindicates that while higher prosocial capabilities sometimes correlate with\nbetter performance, this is not a universal trend-some lower-scoring agents\nexhibit stronger cooperation abilities. Furthermore, we find that\ntop-performing contest submissions are more likely to achieve high scores in\nscenarios where prosocial capabilities are not required. These findings,\ntogether with reports that the contest winner used a hard-coded solution\ntailored to specific environments, suggest that at least one top-performing\nteam may have optimised for conditions where cooperation was not necessary,\npotentially exploiting limitations in the evaluation framework. We provide\nrecommendations for improving the annotation of cooperation demands and propose\nfuture research directions to account for biases introduced by different\ntesting environments.

Recent efforts have aimed to\nunify dataset formats and model interfaces for easier comparisons, yet existing\nframeworks often fall short in supporting heterogeneous traffic scenarios,\njoint prediction models, or user documentation. In this work, we introduce STEP\n-- a new benchmarking framework that addresses these limitations by providing a\nunified interface for multiple datasets, enforcing consistent training and\nevaluation conditions, and supporting a wide range of prediction models. We\ndemonstrate the capabilities of STEP in a number of experiments which reveal 1)\nthe limitations of widely-used testing procedures, 2) the importance of joint\nmodeling of agents for better predictions of interactions, and 3) the\nvulnerability of current state-of-the-art models against both distribution\nshifts and targeted attacks by adversarial agents.

For a particular signal decay, the process\nfor ascertaining the most relevant background processes necessitates a detailed\nanalysis of final state particles, potential misidentifications, and kinematic\noverlaps, which, due to computational limitations, is restricted to the\nsimulation of only the most relevant backgrounds. Moreover, this process\ntypically relies on the physicist's intuition and expertise, as no systematic\nmethod exists.\n  This paper has two primary goals. First, from a particle physics perspective,\nwe present a novel approach that utilises Reinforcement Learning (RL) to\novercome the aforementioned challenges by systematically determining the\ncritical backgrounds affecting beauty hadron decay measurements. While beauty\nhadron physics serves as the case study in this work, the proposed strategy is\nbroadly adaptable to other types of particle physics measurements. Second, from\na Machine Learning perspective, we introduce a novel algorithm which exploits\nthe synergy between RL and Genetic Algorithms (GAs) for environments with\nhighly sparse rewards and a large trajectory space. This strategy leverages GAs\nto efficiently explore the trajectory space and identify successful\ntrajectories, which are used to guide the RL agent's training. Our method also\nincorporates a transformer architecture for the RL agent to handle token\nsequences representing decays.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740

While an increasing number of works focus on\nautonomous workflow construction, most existing approaches rely solely on\nhistorical experience, leading to limitations in efficiency and adaptability.\nWe argue that while historical experience is valuable, workflow construction\nshould also flexibly respond to the unique characteristics of each task. To\nthis end, we propose an a priori dynamic framework for automated workflow\nconstruction. Our framework first leverages Q-table learning to optimize the\ndecision space, guiding agent decisions and enabling effective use of\nhistorical experience. At the same time, agents evaluate the current task\nprogress and make a priori decisions regarding the next executing agent,\nallowing the system to proactively select the more suitable workflow structure\nfor each given task. Additionally, we incorporate mechanisms such as cold-start\ninitialization, early stopping, and pruning to further improve system\nefficiency. Experimental evaluations on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the\nfeasibility and effectiveness of our approach. Compared to state-of-the-art\nbaselines, our method achieves an average improvement of 4.05%, while reducing\nworkflow construction and inference costs to only 30.68%-48.31% of those\nrequired by

This study develops a\npredictive model using ensemble machine learning techniques, leveraging data\nfrom the Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey (2005-2020), comprising 18,108\nrecords with 30 socio-demographic and health attributes. Data preprocessing\nincluded handling missing values, normalization, and balancing with SMOTE,\nfollowed by feature selection to identify key predictors. Several supervised\nensemble algorithms including XGBoost, Random Forest, CatBoost, and AdaBoost\nwere applied to classify nutritional status.

The framework is further enhanced with a dual memory\nsystem-episodic and semantic-that enables continual learning across executions.\nThrough collaborations with design partners, we demonstrate the framework's\npractical utility on real-world deployments, before establishing its efficacy\nagainst the publicly available TRAIL benchmark.

To address this challenge, we propose the Discrepancy of\nEnvironment Dynamics (DoE), a metric that isolates the effects of environment\nshifts on value functions. Building on this, we introduce Discrepancy of\nEnvironment Prioritized Experience Replay (DEER), an adaptive ER framework that\nprioritizes transitions based on both policy updates and environmental changes.\nDEER uses a binary classifier to detect environment changes and applies\ndistinct prioritization strategies before and after each shift, enabling more\nsample-efficient learning.

Automated log anomaly detection is crucial for ensuring the\nreliability of modern software systems. However, existing approaches face\nsignificant limitations: traditional deep learning models lack interpretability\nand generalization, while methods leveraging Large Language Models are often\nhindered by unreliability and factual inaccuracies. To address these issues, we\npropose RationAnomaly, a novel framework that enhances log anomaly detection by\nsynergizing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) fine-tuning with reinforcement learning. Our\napproach first instills expert-like reasoning patterns using CoT-guided\nsupervised fine-tuning, grounded in a high-quality dataset corrected through a\nrigorous expert-driven process.

Initial experiments using pure deep Q-Networks exhibited\nsignificant instability, with agents frequently reverting to poor policies\ndespite occasional good performance. To address this, we developed a hybrid\nmethodology that begins with behavioral cloning on demonstration data from\nrule-based agents, then transitions to reinforcement learning. Our hybrid\napproach achieves consistently above 70% win rate against rule-based opponents,\nsubstantially outperforming pure reinforcement learning methods which showed\nhigh variance and frequent performance degradation.

To address this, we propose\nthe Adversarial Collaboration RAG (AC-RAG) framework. AC-RAG employs two\nheterogeneous agents: a generalist Detector that identifies knowledge gaps, and\na domain-specialized Resolver that provides precise solutions.

In this paper, we take a significant step forward by introducing a\nnew model of constrained feedback in non-stationary multi-armed bandits, where\nthe availability of reward feedback is restricted.

Specifically, our algorithm attains a dynamic regret of\n$\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}({K^{1/3} V_T^{1/3} T }/{ B^{1/3}})$, where $T$ is the\nnumber of rounds, $K$ is the number of arms, $B$ is the query budget, and $V_T$\nis the variation budget capturing the degree of non-stationarity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ube44\uc815\uc0c1 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubb34\uc7a5\ubc34\ub527\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\uc57d\ub41c \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \ub3d9\uc801 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uac70\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \ub3d9\uc801 \ud6c4\ud68c\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ube44\uc815\uc0c1 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubb34\uc7a5\ubc34\ub527\uc758 \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4\uace0 \uac00\uc815\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc2e4\uc81c \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc81c\uc57d\ub41c \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0, \ube44\uc0ac\uc804\uc801 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc131\uc758 \uc815\ub3c4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0ac\uc804 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc5c6\uc774 \ub3d9\uc801 \ud6c4\ud68c\ub97c \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc131 \uc815\ub3c4\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \ubcc0\ub3d9 \uc608\uc0b0 $V_T$\uacfc \ucffc\ub9ac \uc608\uc0b0 $B$\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ub3d9\uc801 \ud6c4\ud68c $\tilde{\text{O}}({K^{1/3} V_T^{1/3} T }/{ B^{1/3}})$\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ud55c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \uc81c\uc57d\ub41c \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\uc5ec \ube44\uc815\uc0c1 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubb34\uc7a5\ubc34\ub527 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ube44\uc815\uc0c1 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubb34\uc7a5\ubc34\ub527\uc740 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc758 \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ubcc0\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ub77c\uc6b4\ub4dc\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc774 \uc81c\uacf5\ub41c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac00\uc815\uc744 \ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ub9ce\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub97c \uac04\uacfc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc758 \uac00\uc6a9\uc131\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ube44\uc815\uc0c1 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubb34\uc7a5\ubc34\ub527\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\uc57d\ub41c \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc9c4\uc804\uc744 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc131\uc758 \uc815\ub3c4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0ac\uc804 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc774 \ud544\uc694 \uc5c6\ub294 \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \ube44\uc0ac\uc804\uc801 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc774 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uac70\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \ub3d9\uc801 \ud6c4\ud68c\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \ub3d9\uc801 \ud6c4\ud68c $\tilde{\text{O}}({K^{1/3} V_T^{1/3} T }/{ B^{1/3}})$\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5ec\uae30\uc11c $T$\ub294 \ub77c\uc6b4\ub4dc \uc218, $K$\ub294 \ubb34\uc7a5 \uc218, $B$\ub294 \ucffc\ub9ac \uc608\uc0b0, $V_T$\ub294 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc131\uc758 \uc815\ub3c4\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \ubcc0\ub3d9 \uc608\uc0b0\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

We study a strategic setting where a human user\ninteracts with multiple differently misaligned AI agents, none of which are\nindividually well-aligned. Our key insight is that when the users utility lies\napproximately within the convex hull of the agents utilities, a condition that\nbecomes easier to satisfy as model diversity increases, strategic competition\ncan yield outcomes comparable to interacting with a perfectly aligned model. We\nmodel this as a multi-leader Stackelberg game, extending Bayesian persuasion to\nmulti-round conversations between differently informed parties, and prove three\nresults: (1) when perfect alignment would allow the user to learn her\nBayes-optimal action, she can also do so in all equilibria under the convex\nhull condition (2) under weaker assumptions requiring only approximate utility\nlearning, a non-strategic user employing quantal response achieves near-optimal\nutility in all equilibria and (3) when the user selects the best single AI\nafter an evaluation period, equilibrium guarantees remain near-optimal without\nfurther distributional assumptions.

While these approaches improve reasoning through agent\ninteraction, they are limited by static, pre-assigned roles, which hinder\nadaptability and dynamic knowledge integration. To address these limitations,\nwe propose KAMAC, a Knowledge-driven Adaptive Multi-Agent Collaboration\nframework that enables LLM agents to dynamically form and expand expert teams\nbased on the evolving diagnostic context. KAMAC begins with one or more expert\nagents and then conducts a knowledge-driven discussion to identify and fill\nknowledge gaps by recruiting additional specialists as needed. This supports\nflexible, scalable collaboration in complex clinical scenarios, with decisions\nfinalized through reviewing updated agent comments. Experiments on two\nreal-world medical benchmarks demonstrate that KAMAC significantly outperforms\nboth single-agent and advanced multi-agent methods, particularly in complex\nclinical scenarios (i.e., cancer prognosis) requiring dynamic, cross-specialty\nexpertise.

In this paper, we address the problem of applying CP for\nregression models when the calibration set contains noisy labels. We begin by\nestablishing a mathematically grounded procedure for estimating the noise-free\nCP threshold. Then, we turn it into a practical algorithm that overcomes the\nchallenges arising from the continuous nature of the regression problem.

Drawing on Systemic\nFunctional Linguistics and Appraisal Theory, we analyzed 120 metareviews to\nexplore how generative AI feedback constructs meaning across ideational,\ninterpersonal, and textual dimensions.

MACA enables agents\nto teach themselves to be more decisive and concise, and better leverage peer\ninsights in multi-agent settings without external supervision, driving\nsubstantial improvements across self-consistency (+27.6% on GSM8K),\nsingle-agent reasoning (+23.7% on MATH), sampling-based inference (+22.4%\nPass@20 on MATH), and multi-agent ensemble decision-making (+42.7% on MathQA).\nThese findings, coupled with strong generalization to unseen benchmarks (+16.3%\non GPQA, +11.6% on CommonsenseQA), demonstrate robust self-alignment that more\nreliably unlocks latent reasoning potential of language models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uc774 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud569\uc758 \uc815\ub82c(MACA)\ub77c\ub294 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \ub17c\uc758\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uacb0\uc815\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uac04\uacb0\ud55c \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uc740 \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ubaa8\uc21c\ub41c \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uacb0\uacfc\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc9c0\ub294 \ucd94\ub860 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6cc\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc18\uc601\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "MACA\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud1a0\ub860\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc218/\uc18c\uc218 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub0b4\uc801 \ud569\uc758\uc5d0 \ub9de\ub294 \ucd94\ub860 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc120\ud638\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud6c4 \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\ub294 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "result": "MACA\ub294 \uc790\uae30 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c +27.6%, \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0\uc11c +23.7%, \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \uae30\ubc18 \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0\uc11c +22.4%, \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc559\uc0c1\ube14 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c +42.7%\uc758 \uc131\uacfc \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801\uc778 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ub354 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uc788\uac8c \uc5f4 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac15\ud55c \uc790\uae30 \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(Language Models, LMs)\uc740 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc774 \uacb0\uc5ec\ub41c \ucd94\ub860\uae30\uc774\uba70, \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ubaa8\uc21c\ub41c \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \uc885\uc885 \uc788\ub2e4. \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc\uac04 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\uc131\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud575\uc2ec \ubb38\uc81c\uc778 'LM\uc774 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uacb0\uacfc\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc9c0\ub294 \ucd94\ub860 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\ub294\ub2e4'\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc790\uae30 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 \uc798 \uc815\ub82c\ub41c \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801 \uc18d\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \ud615\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uace0 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud569\uc758 \uc815\ub82c(Multi-Agent Consensus Alignment, MACA)\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud1a0\ub860\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc218/\uc18c\uc218 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ub0b4\uc801 \ud569\uc758\uc640 \uc77c\uce58\ud558\ub294 \ucd94\ub860 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc120\ud638\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud6c4 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uc9c4\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacbd\ub85c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\ub3c4\uc758 \uc9d1\uacc4\uac00 \uc544\ub2cc \ub3d9\ub8cc\uc758 \uc8fc\uc7a5\uc744 \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc9c4\ud589\ud558\ub294 \uc2ec\uc758\uc801 \uad50\ud658\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uba70, \ub2e8\uc77c \ub77c\uc6b4\ub4dc \ub2e4\uc218\uacb0 \ud22c\ud45c\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \ud569\uc758 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.

This setting\ncan be framed as a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) environment with\nfull cooperative reward among the autonomous vehicles. While methods such as\nMulti-agent Proximal Policy Optimization can be effective in training MARL\ntasks, they often fail to resolve local conflict between agents and are unable\nto generalize to stochastic events.
