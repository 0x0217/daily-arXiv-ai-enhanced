A promising way to fill this gap in Agentic AI is to equip agents\nwith long-lived digital identities and introduce tamper-proof and flexible\nidentity-bound attestations of agents, provisioned by commonly trusted third\nparties and designed for cross-domain verifiability. This article presents a\nconceptual framework and a prototypical multi-agent system, where each agent is\nendowed with a self-sovereign digital identity. It combines a unique and\nledger-anchored Decentralized Identifier (DID) of an agent with a set of\nthird-party issued Verifiable Credentials (VCs). This enables agents at the\nstart of a dialog to prove ownership of their self-controlled DIDs for\nauthentication purposes and to establish various cross-domain trust\nrelationships through the spontaneous exchange of their self-hosted DID-bound\nVCs.

These resourceful data from\nsocial media also introduce a significant and underexplored privacy risk: the\ninference of sensitive personal attributes from seemingly daily media content.\nHowever, the lack of benchmarks and comprehensive evaluations of\nstate-of-the-art M-LLM capabilities hinders the research of private attribute\nprofiling on social media. Accordingly, we propose (1) PRISM, the first\nmulti-modal, multi-dimensional and fine-grained synthesized dataset\nincorporating a comprehensive privacy landscape and dynamic user history; (2)\nan Efficient evaluation framework that measures the cross-modal privacy\ninference capabilities of advanced M-LLM. Specifically, PRISM is a large-scale\nsynthetic benchmark designed to evaluate cross-modal privacy risks. Its key\nfeature is 12 sensitive attribute labels across a diverse set of multi-modal\nprofiles, which enables targeted privacy analysis. These profiles are generated\nvia a sophisticated LLM agentic workflow, governed by a prior distribution to\nensure they realistically mimic social media users. Additionally, we propose a\nMulti-Agent Inference Framework that leverages a pipeline of specialized LLMs\nto enhance evaluation capabilities. We evaluate the inference capabilities of\nsix leading M-LLMs (Qwen, Gemini, GPT-4o, GLM, Doubao, and Grok) on PRISM. The\ncomparison with human performance reveals that these MLLMs significantly\noutperform in accuracy and efficiency, highlighting the threat of potential\nprivacy risks and the urgent need for robust defenses.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(M-LLM)\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uc640 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ucd9c\ucc98\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc554\ubb35\uc801\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud569\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc18c\uc15c \ubbf8\ub514\uc5b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc218\uc9d1\ub418\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub294 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \uac1c\uc778 \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \ucd94\ub860\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "PRISM\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec, \ub2e4\ucc28\uc6d0, \uc138\ubd84\ud654\ub41c \ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud3c9\uac00 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 M-LLM\uc758 \ud06c\ub85c\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uce21\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "PRISM\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ud504\ub85c\ud30c\uc77c\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 12\uac1c\uc758 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \uc18d\uc131 \ub808\uc774\ube14\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, 6\uac1c\uc758 \uc120\ub3c4\uc801\uc778 M-LLM\ub4e4\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "M-LLM\uc740 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uacfc \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uac04 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ucd08\uacfc\ud588\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc \uc704\ud5d8\uacfc \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ubc29\uc5b4\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(M-LLMs)\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uc640 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ucd9c\ucc98\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc554\ubb35\uc801 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud569\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc18c\uc15c \ubbf8\ub514\uc5b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc218\uc9d1\ub418\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub294 \uc77c\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \ubbf8\ub514\uc5b4 \ucf58\ud150\uce20\uc5d0\uc11c \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \uac1c\uc778 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \ucd94\ub860\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc2ec\uac01\ud558\uace0 \ud0d0\uc0c9\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 M-LLM \uae30\ub2a5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc640 \uc885\ud569\uc801\uc778 \ud3c9\uac00\uc758 \ubd80\uc871\uc740 \uc18c\uc15c \ubbf8\ub514\uc5b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uac1c\uc778 \uc18d\uc131 \ud504\ub85c\ud30c\uc77c\ub9c1 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ubc29\ud574\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 (1) \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc \ud658\uacbd\uacfc \ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uae30\ub85d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec, \ub2e4\ucc28\uc6d0, \uc138\ubd84\ud654\ub41c \ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc778 PRISM\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4;

Insights from Ancient Delphi on the future of blockchain oracles", "comment": "Not peer reviewed", "summary": "The oracle problem refers to the inability of an agent to know if the\ninformation coming from an oracle is authentic and unbiased. In ancient times,\nphilosophers and historians debated on how to evaluate, increase, and secure\nthe reliability of oracle predictions, particularly those from Delphi, which\npertained to matters of state. Today, we refer to data carriers for automatic\nmachines as oracles, but establishing a secure channel between these oracles\nand the real world still represents a challenge. Despite numerous efforts, this\nproblem remains mostly unsolved, and the recent advent of blockchain oracles\nhas added a layer of complexity because of the decentralization of blockchains.\nThis paper conceptually connects Delphic and modern blockchain oracles,\ndeveloping a comparative framework. Leveraging blockchain oracle taxonomy,\nlexical analysis is also performed on 167 Delphic queries to shed light on the\nrelationship between oracle answer quality and question type. The presented\nframework aims first at revealing commonalities between classical and\ncomputational oracles and then at enriching the oracle analysis within each\nfield. This study contributes to the computer science literature by proposing\nstrategies to improve the reliability of blockchain oracles based on insights\nfrom Delphi and to classical literature by introducing a framework that can\nalso be applied to interpret and classify other ancient oracular mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc624\ub77c\ud074 \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \uc815\ubcf4\uc758

We present ALAS,\na stateful, disruption-aware framework that separates planning from\nnon-circular validation, records a versioned execution log for grounded checks\nand restore points, and performs localized repair that preserves work in\nprogress. The validator operates independently of the planning LLM with fresh,\nbounded context, avoiding self-check loops and mid-context attrition. The\nrepair protocol edits only the minimal affected region under explicit policies\n(retry, catch, timeout, backoff, idempotency keys, compensation, loop guards)\ndefined in a canonical workflow IR that maps to Amazon States Language and Argo\nWorkflows. On job-shop scheduling suites (DMU, TA) across five classical\nbenchmarks, ALAS matches or exceeds strong single-LLM and multi-agent\nbaselines, achieving 83.7% success, reducing token usage by 60%, and running\n1.82times faster under comparable settings. A minimal reliability study shows\nthat the validator detects injected structural faults with low overhead, and\nthat localized repair contains runtime perturbations with a bounded edit radius\nand less makespan degradation than global recompute. Results indicate that the\ncombination of validator isolation, versioned execution logs, and localized\nrepair provides measurable efficiency, feasibility, and scalability for\nmulti-agent LLM planning.

AI control offers one approach to\nmitigating the risk from untrusted AI agents by monitoring their actions and\nintervening or auditing when necessary. Evaluating the safety of these\nprotocols requires understanding both their effectiveness against current\nattacks and their robustness to adaptive adversaries. In this work, we\nsystematically evaluate a range of control protocols in SHADE-Arena, a dataset\nof diverse agentic environments. First, we evaluate blue team protocols,\nincluding deferral to trusted models, resampling, and deferring on critical\nactions, against a default attack policy. We find that resampling for\nincrimination and deferring on critical actions perform best, increasing safety\nfrom 50% to 96%.

When multiple tasks\nare involved, agents can also leverage knowledge from one task to improve\nlearning in other tasks. In this paper, we propose Multi-task Communication\nSkills (MCS), a MADRL with communication method that learns and performs\nmultiple tasks simultaneously, with agents interacting through learnable\ncommunication protocols. MCS employs a Transformer encoder to encode\ntask-specific observations into a shared message space, capturing shared\ncommunication skills among agents. To enhance coordination among agents, we\nintroduce a prediction network that correlates messages with the actions of\nsender agents in each task. We adapt three multi-agent benchmark environments\nto multi-task settings, where the number of agents as well as the observation\nand action spaces vary across tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that MCS\nachieves better performance than multi-task MADRL baselines without\ncommunication, as well as single-task MADRL baselines with and without\ncommunication.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2ec\uce35 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uae30\uc220(MCS)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2ec\uce35 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc774 \uc11c\ub85c \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud611\ub825\ud558\uc5ec \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc791\uc5c5\uc774 \uc5f0\uad00\ub41c \uacbd\uc6b0, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc740 \ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\ub978 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "MCS\ub294 \ud559\uc2b5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud558\uba70, Transformer \uc778\ucf54\ub354\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc791\uc5c5 \ud2b9\uc815 \uad00\ucc30\uc744 \uacf5\uc720 \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0 \uacf5\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uc608\uce21 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uac01 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubc1c\uc2e0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uacfc \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0\ub97c \uc5f0\uad00\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, MCS\ub294 \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc774 \uc5c6\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc791\uc5c5 MADRL \uae30\uc900\uc120\ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc791\uc5c5 MADRL \uae30\uc900\uc120\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "MCS\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04 \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2ec\uce35 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(MADRL)\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc11c\ub85c \ud1b5\uc2e0\ud558\uc5ec \uc870\uc815\ub41c \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc791\uc5c5\uc774 \uad00\ub828\ub41c \uacbd\uc6b0, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\ub978 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ud559\uc2b5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud558\uba70 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uace0 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 MADRL \uae30\ubc95\uc778 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uae30\uc220(MCS)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Large language models show promise for\nindividual tasks, but end-to-end analytical workflows expose fundamental\nlimitations: attention dilutes across growing contexts, specialized reasoning\npatterns interfere, and errors propagate undetected. We present PublicAgent, a\nmulti-agent framework that addresses these limitations through decomposition\ninto specialized agents for intent clarification, dataset discovery, analysis,\nand reporting. This architecture maintains focused attention within agent\ncontexts and enables validation at each stage. Evaluation across five models\nand 50 queries derives five design principles for multi-agent LLM systems.\nFirst, specialization provides value independent of model strength--even the\nstrongest model shows 97.5% agent win rates, with benefits orthogonal to model\nscale. Second, agents divide into universal (discovery, analysis) and\nconditional (report, intent) categories. Universal agents show consistent\neffectiveness (std dev 12.4%) while conditional agents vary by model (std dev\n20.5%). Third, agents mitigate distinct failure modes--removing discovery or\nanalysis causes catastrophic failures (243-280 instances), while removing\nreport or intent causes quality degradation. Fourth, architectural benefits\npersist across task complexity with stable win rates (86-92% analysis, 84-94%\ndiscovery), indicating workflow management value rather than reasoning\nenhancement. Fifth, wide variance in agent effectiveness across models (42-96%\nfor analysis) requires model-aware architecture design. These principles guide\nwhen and why specialization is necessary for complex analytical workflows while\nenabling broader access to public data through natural language interfaces.", "AI": {"tldr": "Open data repositories\ub294 \uc99d\uac70 \uae30\ubc18 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ube44\uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc5d0\uac8c\ub294 \uc811\uadfc\uc774 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0.

We present\nScalingEval, a large-scale benchmarking study that systematically compares 36\nLLMs, including GPT, Gemini, Claude, and Llama, across multiple product\ncategories using a consensus-driven evaluation protocol. Our multi-agent\nframework aggregates pattern audits and issue codes into ground-truth labels\nvia scalable majority voting, enabling reproducible comparison of LLM\nevaluators without human annotation. Applied to large-scale complementary-item\nrecommendation, the benchmark reports four key findings: (i) Anthropic Claude\n3.5 Sonnet achieves the highest decision confidence; (ii) Gemini 1.5 Pro offers\nthe best overall performance across categories; (iii) GPT-4o provides the most\nfavorable latency-accuracy-cost tradeoff; and (iv) GPT-OSS 20B leads among\nopen-source models. Category-level analysis shows strong consensus in\nstructured domains (Electronics, Sports) but persistent disagreement in\nlifestyle categories (Clothing, Food).

With\napplication domains ranging from warehouse logistics to windfarm management,\nco-design promises to fundamentally change how we deploy multi-agent systems.\nHowever, current co-design methods struggle to scale. They collapse under\nhigh-dimensional environment design spaces and suffer from sample inefficiency\nwhen addressing moving targets inherent to joint optimisation. We address these\nchallenges by developing Diffusion Co-Design (DiCoDe), a scalable and\nsample-efficient co-design framework pushing co-design towards practically\nrelevant settings. DiCoDe incorporates two core innovations. First, we\nintroduce Projected Universal Guidance (PUG), a sampling technique that enables\nDiCoDe to explore a distribution of reward-maximising environments while\nsatisfying hard constraints such as spatial separation between obstacles.\nSecond, we devise a critic distillation mechanism to share knowledge from the\nreinforcement learning critic, ensuring that the guided diffusion model adapts\nto evolving agent policies using a dense and up-to-date learning signal.\nTogether, these improvements lead to superior environment-policy pairs when\nvalidated on challenging multi-agent environment co-design benchmarks including\nwarehouse automation, multi-agent pathfinding and wind farm optimisation.

The challenges posed by optimization problems are primarily\nmanifested in their non-convexity, high-dimensionality, black-box nature, and\nother unfavorable characteristics. Traditional zero-order or first-order\nmethods, which are often characterized by low efficiency, inaccurate gradient\ninformation, and insufficient utilization of optimization information, are\nill-equipped to address these challenges effectively. In recent years, the\nrapid development of large language models (LLM) has led to substantial\nimprovements in their language understanding and code generation capabilities.\nConsequently, the design of optimization algorithms leveraging large language\nmodels has garnered increasing attention from researchers. In this study, we\nchoose the fireworks algorithm(FWA) as the basic optimizer and propose a novel\napproach to assist the design of the FWA by incorporating multi-modal large\nlanguage model(MLLM). To put it simply, we propose the concept of Critical\nPart(CP), which extends FWA to complex high-dimensional tasks, and further\nutilizes the information in the optimization process with the help of the\nmulti-modal characteristics of large language models. We focus on two specific\ntasks: the \\textit{traveling salesman problem }(TSP) and \\textit{electronic\ndesign automation problem} (EDA). The experimental results show that FWAs\ngenerated under our new framework have achieved or surpassed SOTA results on\nmany problem instances.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294

Traditional\nmethods can be resource-intensive and prone to inefficiencies. To address this,\nwe formalize the engineering design process through a multi-agent AI framework\nthat integrates structured design and review loops. The framework introduces\nspecialized knowledge-driven agents that collaborate to generate and refine\ndesign candidates. As an exemplar, we demonstrate its application to the\naerodynamic optimization of 4-digit NACA airfoils. The framework consists of\nthree key AI agents: a Graph Ontologist, a Design Engineer, and a Systems\nEngineer. The Graph Ontologist employs a Large Language Model (LLM) to\nconstruct two domain-specific knowledge graphs from airfoil design literature.\nThe Systems Engineer, informed by a human manager, formulates technical\nrequirements that guide design generation and evaluation. The Design Engineer\nleverages the design knowledge graph and computational tools to propose\ncandidate airfoils meeting these requirements. The Systems Engineer reviews and\nprovides feedback both qualitative and quantitative using its own knowledge\ngraph, forming an iterative feedback loop until a design is validated by the\nmanager. The final design is then optimized to maximize performance metrics\nsuch as the lift-to-drag ratio. Overall, this work demonstrates how\ncollaborative AI agents equipped with structured knowledge representations can\nenhance efficiency, consistency, and quality in the engineering design process.",

This paper\nproposes a novel safety response framework designed to systematically safeguard\nLLMs at both the input and output levels. At the input level, the framework\nemploys a supervised fine-tuning-based safety classification model. Through a\nfine-grained four-tier taxonomy (Safe, Unsafe, Conditionally Safe, Focused\nAttention), it performs precise risk identification and differentiated handling\nof user queries, significantly enhancing risk coverage and business scenario\nadaptability, and achieving a risk recall rate of 99.3%. At the output level,\nthe framework integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a\nspecifically fine-tuned interpretation model, ensuring all responses are\ngrounded in a real-time, trustworthy knowledge base. This approach eliminates\ninformation fabrication and enables result traceability. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our proposed safety control model achieves a significantly\nhigher safety score on public safety evaluation benchmarks compared to the\nbaseline model, TinyR1-Safety-8B. Furthermore, on our proprietary high-risk\ntest set, the framework's components attained a perfect 100% safety score,\nvalidating their exceptional protective capabilities in complex risk

While recent breakthroughs have matched elite\nhuman play at no-limit Texas hold'em, the multi-player dynamics are subdued:\nmost hands converge quickly with only two players engaged through multiple\nrounds of bidding. In this paper, we present Solly, the first AI agent to\nachieve elite human play in reduced-format Liar's Poker, a game characterized\nby extensive multi-player engagement. We trained Solly using self-play with a\nmodel-free, actor-critic, deep reinforcement learning algorithm. Solly played\nat an elite human level as measured by win rate (won over 50% of hands) and\nequity (money won) in heads-up and multi-player Liar's Poker. Solly also\noutperformed large language models (LLMs), including those with reasoning\nabilities, on the same metrics. Solly developed novel bidding strategies,\nrandomized play effectively, and was not easily exploitable by world-class\nhuman players.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 Solly\uac00 Liar's Poker\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d8\ub9ac\ud2b8 \uc778\uac04 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uc778 \ub3d9\uc801 \ubc0f \ubd88\uc644\uc804\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4 \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \uac16\ucd98 \uac8c\uc784\uc5d0\uc11c AI \uc5f0\uad6c\uc790\ub4e4\uc774 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ubca0\ub4dc\ub85c \ud3ec\ucee4\uc640 \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \uc624\ub7ab\ub3d9\uc548 \uc9d1\uc911\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud574\uc654\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc5c6\ub294 \ubc30\uc6b0-\ube44\ud3c9\uc790 \uc2ec\uce35 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc73c\ub85c \uc790\uae30 \ub180\uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 Solly\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "Solly\ub294 \ud5e4\ub4dc\uc5c5 \ubc0f \ub2e4\uc778 Liar's Poker\uc5d0\uc11c 50% \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \ud578\ub4dc\ub97c \uc774\uae30\uace0, \uc218\uc775 \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc5d8\ub9ac\ud2b8 \uc778\uac04 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\ub97c \ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Solly\ub294 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc778\uac04 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\uc5b4\uc5d0\uac8c \uc27d\uac8c \uc774\uc6a9\ub2f9\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \ub3c5\ucc3d\uc801\uc778 \uc785\ucc30 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uace0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubb34\uc791\uc704 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "AI \uc5f0\uad6c\uc790\ub4e4\uc740 \uc624\ub7ab\ub3d9\uc548 \ub2e4\uc778 \uc5ed\ud559, \ubd88\uc644\uc804\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4, \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ucd94\ub860\uc774 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc778 \ud658\uacbd\uc758 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ubca0\ub4dc\ub85c \ud3ec\ucee4\uc640 \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uac8c\uc784\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\ud574\uc654\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc\uc758 \ub3cc\ud30c\uad6c\ub294 \ub178 \ub9ac\ubc0b \ud14d\uc0ac\uc2a4 \ud640\ub364\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d8\ub9ac\ud2b8 \uc778\uac04 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\ub97c \ub300\uc751\ud588\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub2e4\uc778 \uc5ed\ud559\uc740 \uc57d\ud574\uc9d1\ub2c8\ub2e4: \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \ud578\ub4dc\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub77c\uc6b4\ub4dc\uc758 \ub0b4\uae30\uc5d0\uc11c \ub450 \uba85\uc758 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\uc5b4\ub9cc \uad00\uc5ec\ud558\uc5ec \ube60\ub974\uac8c \uc218\ub834\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \ub2e4\uc778 \ucc38\uc5ec\uac00 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc778 \uac8c\uc784\uc778 Liar's Poker\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d8\ub9ac\ud2b8 \uc778\uac04 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 Solly\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc5c6\ub294 \ubc30\uc6b0-\ube44\ud3c9\uc790 \uc2ec\uce35 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc790\uae30 \ub180\uc774\ub85c Solly\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

That\napproach scored approximately 7.8% on the public ARC AGI II evaluation set, but\nrequired a level of compute far in excess of what is allowed during the\ncompetition. This paper shows that, by starting from a tiny recursive model\nthat has been pre-trained on public ARC tasks, one can efficiently fine-tune on\ncompetition tasks within the allowed compute limits. Specifically, a model was\npre-trained on 1,280 public tasks for 700k+ optimizer steps over 48 hours on\n4xH100 SXM GPUs to obtain a ~10% score on the public evaluation set. That model\nwas then post-trained in just 12,500 gradient steps during the competition to\nreach a score of 6.67% on semi-private evaluation tasks.

Building upon previous work that\ndemonstrated the strong expressiveness of ENNs with compact architectures, we\nnow emphasize their efficiency, interpretability and pruning capabilities. The\nDCT-based parameterization provides a structured and decorrelated\nrepresentation that reveals the functional role of each neuron and allows\ndirect identification of redundant components. Leveraging this property, we\npropose an efficient pruning strategy that removes unnecessary DCT coefficients\nwith negligible or no loss in performance. Experimental results across\nclassification and implicit neural representation tasks confirm that ENNs\nachieve state-of-the-art accuracy while maintaining a low number of parameters.\nFurthermore, up to 40% of the activation coefficients can be safely pruned,\nthanks to the orthogonality and bounded nature of the DCT basis.

In recent years, advances\nin deep learning have significantly expanded the capabilities and scalability\nof imitation learning across a range of domains, where expert data can range\nfrom full state-action trajectories to partial observations or unlabeled\nsequences. Alongside this growth, novel approaches have emerged, with new\nmethodologies being developed to address longstanding challenges such as\ngeneralization, covariate shift, and demonstration quality.

Their design, however, remains a largely handcrafted process,\nresulting in long and error-prone design cycles. While the recent rise of\nAI-based reinforcement learning and generative AI has created new techniques to\nautomate this task, the need for many time-consuming simulations is a critical\nbottleneck hindering the overall efficiency. Furthermore, the lack of\nexplainability of the resulting design solutions hampers widespread adoption of\nthe tools. To address these issues, a novel agentic AI framework for\nsample-efficient and explainable analog circuit sizing is presented. It employs\na multi-agent workflow where specialized Large Language Model (LLM)-based\nagents collaborate to interpret the circuit topology, to understand the design\ngoals, and to iteratively refine the circuit's design parameters towards the\ntarget goals with human-interpretable reasoning. The adaptive simulation\nstrategy creates an intelligent control that yields a high sample efficiency.\nThe AnaFlow framework is demonstrated for two circuits of varying complexity\nand is able to complete the sizing task fully automatically, differently from\npure Bayesian optimization and reinforcement learning approaches. The system\nlearns from its optimization history to avoid past mistakes and to accelerate\nconvergence.

Traditional Pavement Management Systems (PMS) remain\nlargely reactive, lacking real-time intelligence for failure prevention and\noptimal maintenance planning. To address this, we propose a unified Digital\nTwin (DT) and Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework for scalable, data-driven\npavement health monitoring and predictive maintenance. Pavement segments and\nspatial relations are modeled as graph nodes and edges, while real-time UAV,\nsensor, and LiDAR data stream into the DT. The inductive GNN learns\ndeterioration patterns from graph-structured inputs to forecast distress and\nenable proactive interventions. Trained on a real-world-inspired dataset with\nsegment attributes and dynamic connectivity, our model achieves an R2 of\n0.3798, outperforming baseline regressors and effectively capturing non-linear\ndegradation. We also develop an interactive dashboard and reinforcement\nlearning module for simulation, visualization, and adaptive maintenance\nplanning. This DT-GNN integration enhances forecasting precision and\nestablishes a closed feedback loop for continuous improvement, positioning the\napproach as a foundation for proactive, intelligent, and

For example,\nwe may wish to design a protein to bind its target, arrange components within a\ncircuit to minimize latency, or find materials with certain properties. Given a\nproperty predictive model, in silico design typically involves training a\ngenerative model over the design space (e.g., protein sequence space) to\nconcentrate on designs with the desired properties. Distributional optimization\n-- which can be formalized as an estimation of distribution algorithm or as\nreinforcement learning policy optimization -- finds the generative model that\nmaximizes an objective function in expectation. Optimizing a distribution over\ndiscrete-valued designs is in general challenging because of the combinatorial\nnature of the design space. However, many property predictors in scientific\napplications are decomposable in the sense that they can be factorized over\ndesign variables in a way that could in principle enable more effective\noptimization. For example, amino acids at a catalytic site of a protein may\nonly loosely interact with amino acids of the rest of the protein to achieve\nmaximal catalytic activity. Current distributional optimization algorithms are\nunable to make use of such decomposability structure. Herein, we propose and\ndemonstrate use of a new distributional optimization algorithm,\nDecomposition-Aware Distributional Optimization (DADO), that can leverage any\ndecomposability defined by a junction tree on the design variables, to make\noptimization more efficient. At its core, DADO employs a soft-factorized\n\"search distribution\" -- a learned generative model -- for efficient navigation\nof the search space, invoking graph message-passing to coordinate optimization\nacross linked factors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubd84\ud574 \uc778\uc2dd \ubd84\ud3ec \ucd5c\uc801\ud654(DADO) \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744

Jin Kim"], "title": "Periodic Skill Discovery", "comment": "NeurIPS 2025", "summary": "Unsupervised skill discovery in reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn\ndiverse behaviors without relying on external rewards. However, current methods\noften overlook the periodic nature of learned skills, focusing instead on\nincreasing the mutual dependence between states and skills or maximizing the\ndistance traveled in latent space. Considering that many robotic tasks --\nparticularly those involving locomotion -- require periodic behaviors across\nvarying timescales, the ability to discover diverse periodic skills is\nessential. Motivated by this, we propose Periodic Skill Discovery (PSD), a\nframework that discovers periodic behaviors in an unsupervised manner. The key\nidea of PSD is to train an encoder that maps states to a circular latent space,\nthereby naturally encoding periodicity in the latent representation. By\ncapturing temporal distance, PSD can effectively learn skills with diverse\nperiods in complex robotic tasks, even with pixel-based observations.

Designing\neffective adaptation policies, however, depends on managing the uncertainty of\nlong-term climate impacts. Meanwhile, such policies can feature important\nnormative choices that are not always made explicit. We propose that\nReinforcement Learning (RL) can be a useful tool to both identify adaptation\npathways under uncertain conditions while it also allows for the explicit\nmodelling (and consequent comparison) of different adaptation priorities (e.g.\neconomic vs. wellbeing). We use an Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) to link\ntogether a rainfall and flood model, and compute the impacts of flooding in\nterms of quality of life (QoL), transportation, and infrastructure damage. Our\nresults show that models prioritising QoL over economic impacts results in more\nadaptation spending as well as a more even distribution of spending over the\nstudy area, highlighting the extent to which such normative assumptions can\nalter adaptation policy.

The\ndecentralization of this approach enables significant computational savings by\navoiding the cubic scaling of centralized methods through cycle consistency.\nBoth proposed algorithms achieve lower reconstruction error across experimental\nsettings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub2e4\uc911 \ucc38\uc870 \uc815\ub82c(MRA) \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uc5ec \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc5f0\uc0b0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud568.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc815\ub82c \uad00\uce21\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc815\ub82c\ud558\uace0 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc740 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud655\ub960\ub860\uc801 \uc811\uadfc\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec MRA\ub97c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uace0 \uc0c1\ub300\uc801 \uc790\uc138\ub97c nuisance \ubcc0\uc218\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ub450 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \ubaa8\ub450 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ub0ae\uc740 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \ubd84\uc0b0\ud654\ub294 \uc0ac\uc774\ud074 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uc911\uc2dd \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \uc138\uc81c\uacf1 \uc99d\uac00\ub97c \ud53c\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc808\uc57d\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubd84\uc790 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9d5\uc5d0\uc11c \ubb34\uc120 \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc5d0 \uc774\ub974\uae30\uae4c\uc9c0, \uc5ec\ub7ec \uac1c\uc758 \uc815\ub82c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uad00\uce21\uce58\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc815\ub82c\ud558\uace0 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc740 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 cryo-EM, \ucef4\ud4e8\ud130 \ube44\uc804 \ubc0f \ud2b9\ud788 \ubb34\uc120 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc2e4\uc81c \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ucc38\uc870 \uc815\ub82c(MRA) \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Unlike\ntraditional intent recognition systems that depend on large, annotated corpora\nand often struggle with fine-grained, multi-label discrimination, our approach\neliminates the need for costly data collection while enhancing the accuracy of\nmulti-label intention understanding. Specifically, the overall pipeline, named\nDMTC, consists of three steps: 1) using prompt engineering to guide large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to generate diverse synthetic queries in different\ntransport scenarios; 2) encoding each textual query with a Sentence-T5 model to\nobtain compact semantic embeddings; 3) training a lightweight classifier using\na novel online focal-contrastive (OFC) loss that emphasizes hard samples and\nmaximizes inter-class separability. The applicability of the proposed pipeline\nis demonstrated in an agentic AI application in the maritime transportation\ncontext. Extensive experiments show that DMTC achieves a Hamming loss of 5.35%\nand an AUC of 95.92%, outperforming state-of-the-art multi-label classifiers\nand recent end-to-end SOTA LLM-based baselines. Further analysis reveals that\nSentence-T5 embeddings improve subset accuracy by at least 3.29% over\nalternative encoders, and integrating the OFC loss yields an additional 0.98%\ngain compared to standard contrastive objectives. In conclusion, our system\nseamlessly routes user queries to task-specific modules (e.g., ETA information,\ntraffic risk evaluation, and other typical scenarios in the transportation\ndomain), laying the groundwork for fully autonomous, intention-aware agents\nwithout costly manual labelling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubaa8\ub4c8\uc2dd \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ube44\uc758\uc874 \uba40\ud2f0 \ub808\uc774\ube14 \uc758\ub3c4 \uc778\uc2dd \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub300\ub7c9 \uc8fc\uc11d \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5.", "motivation": "\ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4dc\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc218\uc9d1\uc744 \ud53c\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uba40\ud2f0 \ub808\uc774\ube14 \uc758\ub3c4 \uc774\ud574\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc784\uc73c\ub85c\uc368, \uad50\ud1b5 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI \uc751\uc6a9\uc5d0 \uc801\ud569\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud568.", "method": "DMTC\ub77c\ub294 \uc804\uccb4 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc740 \ud06c\uac8c \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub85c \uad6c\uc131: 1) \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\ub9c1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uad50\ud1b5 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc774 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud569\uc131 \ucffc\ub9ac\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc548\ub0b4\ud568;

These requirements\nseverely limit practical applicability, as many real-world scenarios provide\nonly state observations without corresponding actions and expert performance is\noften suboptimal. In this paper we introduce a deep implicit imitation\nreinforcement learning framework that addresses both limitations by combining\ndeep reinforcement learning with implicit imitation learning from\nobservation-only datasets. Our main algorithm, Deep Implicit Imitation\nQ-Network (DIIQN), employs an action inference mechanism that reconstructs\nexpert actions through online exploration and integrates a dynamic confidence\nmechanism that adaptively balances expert-guided and self-directed learning.\nThis enables the agent to leverage expert guidance for accelerated training\nwhile maintaining capacity to surpass suboptimal expert performance. We further\nextend our framework with a Heterogeneous Actions DIIQN (HA-DIIQN) algorithm to\ntackle scenarios where expert and agent possess different action sets, a\nchallenge previously unaddressed in the implicit imitation learning literature.\nHA-DIIQN introduces an infeasibility detection mechanism and a bridging\nprocedure identifying alternative pathways connecting agent capabilities to\nexpert guidance when direct action replication is impossible. Our experimental\nresults demonstrate that DIIQN achieves up to 130% higher episodic returns\ncompared to standard DQN, while consistently outperforming existing implicit\nimitation methods that cannot exceed expert performance.

This study proposes a machine learning-driven framework\nfor (1) detecting malicious cyberattacks and (2) identifying faulty device\nanomalies, leveraging a dataset of 200,000 records. Eight machine learning\nmodels are evaluated across three learning approaches: supervised learning\n(XGBoost, K-Nearest Neighbors (K- NN)), semi-supervised learning (Generative\nAdversarial Networks (GAN), Variational Autoencoders (VAE)), and unsupervised\nlearning (One-Class Support Vector Machine (SVM), Isolation Forest, Graph\nNeural Networks (GNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Autoencoders). The\ncomprehensive evaluation was conducted across multiple metrics like F1-score,\nprecision, recall, accuracy, ROC-AUC, computational efficiency. XGBoost\nachieved 99\\% accuracy with minimal computational overhead (0.04s) for anomaly\ndetection, while Isolation Forest balanced precision and recall effectively.\nLSTM Autoencoders underperformed with lower accuracy and higher latency. For\nattack detection, KNN achieved near-perfect precision, recall, and F1-score\nwith the lowest computational cost (0.05s), followed by VAE at 97% accuracy.\nGAN showed the highest computational cost with lowest accuracy and ROC-AUC.\nThese findings enhance IoT-enabled healthcare security through effective\nanomaly detection strategies. By improving early detection of cyber threats and\ndevice failures, this framework has the potential to prevent data breaches,\nminimize system downtime, and ensure the continuous and safe operation of\nmedical devices, ultimately safeguarding patient health and trust in IoT-driven\nhealthcare solutions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 IoT \uc758\ub8cc \uae30\uae30\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548\uacfc \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc18 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "IoT \uc758\ub8cc \uae30\uae30\uc758 \ud1b5\ud569\uc740 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \uacf5\uaca9\uacfc \uc6b4\uc601 \uc774\uc0c1\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ubcf4\uc548 \ubc0f \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "200,000\uac1c\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud574 \uc545\uc131 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \uacf5\uaca9 \uac10\uc9c0\uc640 \uacb0\ud568 \uc7a5\uce58 \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc704\ud55c 8\uac1c \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "XGBoost\ub294 \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uc5d0\uc11c 99% \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub85c \ucd5c\uc18c\ud55c\uc758 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c \uae30\ub85d\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.
