We\ncompare four policies: PPO, a contextual bandit with an LLM, a direct LLM\npolicy, and a hand-crafted heuristic; Instead of optimizing binary case\noutcomes, agents are trained and evaluated using effective win rate and a\ncomposite exploit score that combines opponent-cost inflation, calendar\npressure, settlement pressure at low merit, and a rule-compliance margin.\nAcross configurable regimes (e.g., bankruptcy stays, inter partes review, tax\nprocedures) and heterogeneous judges, we observe emergent ``exploit chains'',\nsuch as cost-inflating discovery sequences and calendar-pressure tactics that\nremain procedurally valid yet systemically harmful.

KVComm\nleverages the rich information encoded in the KV pairs while avoiding the\npitfalls of hidden states. We introduce a KV layer-wise selection strategy\nbased on attention importance scores with a Gaussian prior to identify the most\ninformative KV pairs for communication.

In practice, anomaly detection systems are rarely\ndeployed for a single use case.

However, these models suffer from overthinking, generating\nunnecessarily long and redundant reasoning even for simple questions, which\nsubstantially increases computational cost and response latency. While existing\nmethods incorporate length rewards to GRPO to promote concise reasoning, they\nincur significant performance degradation. We identify the root cause: when\nrewards for correct but long rollouts are penalized, GRPO's group-relative\nadvantage function can assign them negative advantages, actively discouraging\nvalid reasoning. To overcome this, we propose Decoupled Reward Policy\nOptimization (DRPO), a novel framework that decouples the length-based learning\nsignal of correct rollouts from incorrect ones. DRPO ensures that reward\nsignals for correct rollouts are normalized solely within the positive group,\nshielding them from interference by negative samples. The DRPO's objective is\ngrounded in integrating an optimized positive data distribution, which\nmaximizes length-based rewards under a KL regularization, into a discriminative\nobjective. We derive a closed-form solution for this distribution, enabling\nefficient computation of the objective and its gradients using only on-policy\ndata and importance weighting.

As AI\nsystems increasingly mimic human behavior and interaction with high fidelity,\nthe concept of a \"perfect mimic\"-an entity empirically indistinguishable from a\nhuman through observation and interaction-shifts from hypothetical to\ntechnologically plausible. This paper argues that such developments pose a\nfundamental challenge to the consistency of our mind-recognition practices.\nConsciousness attributions rely heavily, if not exclusively, on empirical\nevidence derived from behavior and interaction. If a perfect mimic provides\nevidence identical to that of humans, any refusal to grant it equivalent\nepistemic status must invoke inaccessible factors, such as qualia, substrate\nrequirements, or origin. Selectively invoking such factors risks a debilitating\ndilemma: either we undermine the rational basis for attributing consciousness\nto others (epistemological solipsism), or we accept inconsistent reasoning.

To overcome this, we propose Decoupled Reward Policy\nOptimization (DRPO), a novel framework that decouples the length-based learning\nsignal of correct rollouts from incorrect ones.

This biologically inspired method\nbeats Large Language models (LLMs) on hard puzzle tasks such as Sudoku, Maze,\nand ARC-AGI while trained with small models (27M parameters) on small data\n(around 1000 examples). HRM holds great promise for solving hard problems with\nsmall networks, but it is not yet well understood and may be suboptimal. We\npropose Tiny Recursive Model (TRM), a much simpler recursive reasoning approach\nthat achieves significantly higher generalization than HRM, while using a\nsingle tiny network with only 2 layers. With only 7M parameters, TRM obtains\n45% test-accuracy on ARC-AGI-1 and 8% on ARC-AGI-2, higher than most LLMs\n(e.g., Deepseek R1, o3-mini, Gemini 2.5 Pro) with less than 0.01% of the\nparameters."}

A common\napproach to discovering these skills is to learn ones that reliably reach\ndifferent states, thus empowering the agent to control its environment.\nHowever, existing skill discovery algorithms often overlook the natural state\nvariables present in many reinforcement learning problems, meaning that the\ndiscovered skills lack control of specific state variables. This can\nsignificantly hamper exploration efficiency, make skills more challenging to\nlearn with, and lead to negative side effects in downstream tasks when the goal\nis under-specified. We introduce a general method that enables these skill\ndiscovery algorithms to learn focused skills -- skills that target and control\nspecific state variables. Our approach improves state space coverage by a\nfactor of three, unlocks new learning capabilities, and automatically avoids\nnegative side effects in downstream tasks."}

However,\nthey often require approximating a different posterior distribution in\ndifferent round of the bandit problem. This requires tricky, round-specific\ntuning of hyperparameters such as dynamic learning rates, causing challenges in\nboth theoretical analysis and practical implementation. To alleviate this\nnon-stationarity, we introduce TS-SA, which incorporates stochastic\napproximation (SA) within the TS framework. In each round, TS-SA constructs a\nposterior approximation only using the most recent reward(s), performs a\nLangevin Monte Carlo (LMC) update, and applies an SA step to average noisy\nproposals over time. This can be interpreted as approximating a stationary\nposterior target throughout the entire algorithm, which further yields a fixed\nstep-size, a unified convergence analysis framework, and improved posterior\nestimates through temporal averaging. We establish near-optimal regret bounds\nfor TS-SA, with a simplified and more intuitive theoretical analysis enabled by\ninterpreting the entire algorithm as a simulation of a stationary SGLD process.\nOur empirical results demonstrate that even a single-step Langevin update with\ncertain warm-up outperforms existing methods substantially on bandit tasks."}
