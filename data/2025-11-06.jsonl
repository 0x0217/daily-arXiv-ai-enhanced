Despite advances in machine learning and automation,\nconventional models remain confined to virtual domains, while real-world\nexperiment and manufacture still rely on human supervision and expertise. This\ngap between machine intelligence and physical execution limits reproducibility,\nscalability, and accessibility across scientific and manufacture workflows.\nHere, we introduce human-AI co-embodied intelligence, a new form of physical AI\nthat unites human users, agentic AI, and wearable hardware into an integrated\nsystem for real-world experiment and intelligent manufacture. In this paradigm,\nhumans provide precise execution and control, while agentic AI contributes\nmemory, contextual reasoning, adaptive planning, and real-time feedback. The\nwearable interface continuously captures the experimental and manufacture\nprocesses, facilitates seamless communication between humans and AI for\ncorrective guidance and interpretable collaboration. As a demonstration, we\npresent Agentic-Physical Experimentation (APEX) system, coupling agentic\nreasoning with physical execution through mixed-reality. APEX observes and\ninterprets human actions, aligns them with standard operating procedures,\nprovides 3D visual guidance, and analyzes every step. Implemented in a\ncleanroom for flexible electronics fabrication, APEX system achieves\ncontext-aware reasoning with accuracy exceeding general multimodal large\nlanguage models, corrects errors in real time, and transfers expertise to\nbeginners.

Substantial progress has been\nmade towards AI agents that can automate scientific research, but all such\nagents remain limited in the number of actions they can take before losing\ncoherence, thus limiting the depth of their findings. Here we present Kosmos,\nan AI scientist that automates data-driven discovery. Given an open-ended\nobjective and a dataset, Kosmos runs for up to 12 hours performing cycles of\nparallel data analysis, literature search, and hypothesis generation before\nsynthesizing discoveries into scientific reports. Unlike prior systems, Kosmos\nuses a structured world model to share information between a data analysis\nagent and a literature search agent. The world model enables Kosmos to\ncoherently pursue the specified objective over 200 agent rollouts, collectively\nexecuting an average of 42,000 lines of code and reading 1,500 papers per run.\nKosmos cites all statements in its reports with code or primary literature,\nensuring its reasoning is traceable. Independent scientists found 79.4% of\nstatements in Kosmos reports to be accurate, and collaborators reported that a\nsingle 20-cycle Kosmos run performed the equivalent of 6 months of their own\nresearch time on average. Furthermore, collaborators reported that the number\nof valuable scientific findings generated scales linearly with Kosmos cycles\n(tested up to 20 cycles). We highlight seven discoveries made by Kosmos that\nspan metabolomics, materials science, neuroscience, and statistical genetics.\nThree discoveries independently reproduce findings from preprinted or\nunpublished manuscripts that were not accessed by Kosmos at runtime, while four\nmake novel contributions to the scientific literature."}

In this technical report we\nintroduce the Apriel-H1 family of hybrid LLMs that combine transformer\nattention and SSM sequence mixers for efficient reasoning at 15B model size.\nThese models are obtained through incremental distillation from a pretrained\nreasoning transformer, Apriel-Nemotron-15B-Thinker, progressively replacing\nless critical attention layers with linear Mamba blocks.\n  We release multiple post-distillation variants of Apriel-H1-15B-Thinker with\ndifferent SSM-to-MHA ratios and analyse how reasoning performance degrades as\nmore Mamba layers replace MHA.

However,\ntransformers suffer from quadratic time and memory complexity in the attention\nmodule (MHA) and require caching key-value states during inference, which\nseverely limits throughput and scalability. High inference throughput is\ncritical for agentic tasks, long-context reasoning, efficient deployment under\nhigh request loads, and more efficient test-time compute scaling.\n  State Space Models (SSMs) such as Mamba offer a promising alternative with\nlinear inference complexity and a constant memory footprint via recurrent\ncomputation with fixed-size hidden states. In this technical report we\nintroduce the Apriel-H1 family of hybrid LLMs that combine transformer\nattention and SSM sequence mixers for efficient reasoning at 15B model size.\nThese models are obtained through incremental distillation from a pretrained\nreasoning transformer, Apriel-Nemotron-15B-Thinker, progressively replacing\nless critical attention layers with linear Mamba blocks.\n  We release multiple post-distillation variants of Apriel-H1-15B-Thinker with\ndifferent SSM-to-MHA ratios and analyse how reasoning performance degrades as\nmore Mamba layers replace MHA. Additionally, we release a 30/50 hybrid variant\nof Apriel-H1, further fine-tuned on a supervised dataset of reasoning traces,\nachieving over 2x higher inference throughput when deployed in the\nproduction-ready vLLM environment, with minimal degradation in reasoning\nperformance. This shows that distilled hybrid SSM-Transformer architectures can\ndeliver substantial efficiency gains over the pretrained transformer equivalent\nwithout substantially compromising the reasoning quality."}

Under Review", "summary": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong capabilities but\nremain limited to fixed modality pairs and require costly fine-tuning with\nlarge aligned datasets. Building fully omni-capable models that can integrate\ntext, images, audio, and video remains impractical and lacks robust reasoning\nsupport. In this paper, we propose an Agent-Omni framework that coordinates\nexisting foundation models through a master-agent system, enabling flexible\nmultimodal reasoning without retraining. The master agent interprets user\nintent, delegates subtasks to modality-specific agents, and integrates their\noutputs into coherent responses. Extensive experiments across text, image,\naudio, video, and omni benchmarks show that Agent-Omni consistently achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance, particularly on tasks requiring complex\ncross-modal reasoning. Its agent-based design enables seamless integration of\nspecialized foundation models, ensuring adaptability to diverse inputs while\nmaintaining transparency and interpretability. In addition, the framework is\nmodular and easily extensible, allowing future improvements as stronger models\nbecome available. %We release an open-source implementation to support\ncontinued research on scalable and reliable omni-modal reasoning."}

Thus, smart contracts\nare subject to security audits. In auditing, proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits\nplay a critical role by demonstrating to the stakeholders that the reported\nvulnerabilities are genuine, reproducible, and actionable. However, manually\ncreating PoCs is time-consuming, error-prone, and often constrained by tight\naudit schedules. We introduce POCO, an agentic framework that automatically\ngenerates executable PoC exploits from natural-language vulnerability\ndescriptions written by auditors. POCO autonomously generates PoC exploits in\nan agentic manner by interacting with a set of code-execution tools in a\nReason-Act-Observe loop. It produces fully executable exploits compatible with\nthe Foundry testing framework, ready for integration into audit reports and\nother security tools. We evaluate POCO on a dataset of 23 real-world\nvulnerability reports. POCO consistently outperforms the prompting and workflow\nbaselines, generating well-formed and logically correct PoCs. Our results\ndemonstrate that agentic frameworks can significantly reduce the effort\nrequired for high-quality PoCs in smart contract audits. Our contribution\nprovides readily actionable knowledge for the smart contract security\ncommunity."}
