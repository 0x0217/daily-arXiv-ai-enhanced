Here we present PANGAEA-GPT, a hierarchical multi-agent framework designed for autonomous data discovery and analysis. Unlike standard Large Language Model (LLM) wrappers, our architecture implements a centralized Supervisor-Worker topology with strict data-type-aware routing, sandboxed deterministic code execution, and self-correction via execution feedback, enabling agents to diagnose and resolve runtime errors. Through use-case scenarios spanning physical oceanography and ecology, we demonstrate the system's capacity to execute complex, multi-step workflows with minimal human intervention.

The capacity of LLMs to self-regulate these complex, context-dependent sensitive information leaks without destroying utility remains an open scientific question. To address this, we introduce SemSIEdit, an inference-time framework where an agentic \"Editor\" iteratively critiques and rewrites sensitive spans to preserve narrative flow rather than simply refusing to answer. Our analysis reveals a Privacy-Utility Pareto Frontier, where this agentic rewriting reduces leakage by 34.6% across all three SemSI categories while incurring a marginal utility loss of 9.8%. We also uncover a Scale-Dependent Safety Divergence: large reasoning models (e.g., GPT-5) achieve safety through constructive expansion (adding nuance), whereas capacity-constrained models revert to destructive truncation (deleting text). Finally, we identify a Reasoning Paradox: while inference-time reasoning increases baseline risk by enabling the model to make deeper sensitive inferences, it simultaneously empowers the defense to execute safe rewrites.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 Large Language Models(LLMs)\uac00 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \ubbfc\uac10 \uc815\ubcf4(SemSI)\uc758 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c SemSIEdit\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLMs\ub294 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \uc2e0\uc6d0 \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \ucd94\ub860\ud558\uac70\ub098, \ud3c9\ud310\uc5d0 \ud574\ub97c \ub07c\uce58\ub294 \ucf58\ud150\uce20\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub4f1 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc704\ud611\uc744 \uc81c\uae30\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "SemSIEdit\ub77c\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec '\ud3b8\uc9d1\uc790'\uac00 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ube44\ud310\ud558\uace0 \uc7ac\uc791\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \ub0b4\ub7ec\ud2f0\ube0c \ud750\ub984\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ubaa8\ub4e0 SemSI \ubc94\uc8fc\uc5d0\uc11c 34.6%\uc758 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc720\ucd9c\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 9.8%\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4 \uc720\ud2f8\ub9ac\ud2f0 \uc190\uc2e4\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc\uac04\uc758 \ucd94\ub860\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ub354 \uae4a\uc740 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \uae30\ucd08\uc801\uc778 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a4\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \uc7ac\uc791\uc131\uc744 \uc2e4\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ubc29\uc5b4\ub97c \uac15\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uac1c\uc778 \uc2dd\ubcc4 \uc815\ubcf4(PII)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubc29\uc5b4\ub294 \uc131\uc219\ud588\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc704\ud611\uc778 \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \ubbfc\uac10 \uc815\ubcf4(SemSI)\ub97c \uc81c\uae30\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5ec\uae30\uc11c \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \uc2e0\uc6d0 \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \ucd94\ub860\ud558\uace0, \ud3c9\ud310\uc5d0 \ud574\ub97c \ub07c\uce58\ub294 \ucf58\ud150\uce20\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uac70\ub098, \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud658\uac01\ud558\uac8c \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Despite encouraging early results, ARL remains highly unstable, often leading to training collapse. This instability limits scalability to larger environments and longer interaction horizons, and constrains systematic exploration of algorithmic design choices. In this paper, we first propose ARLArena, a stable training recipe and systematic analysis framework that examines training stability in a controlled and reproducible setting. ARLArena first constructs a clean and standardized testbed. Then, we decompose policy gradient into four core design dimensions and assess the performance and stability of each dimension. Through this fine-grained analysis, we distill a unified perspective on ARL and propose SAMPO, a stable agentic policy optimization method designed to mitigate the dominant sources of instability in ARL. Empirically, SAMPO achieves consistently stable training and strong performance across diverse agentic tasks. Overall, this study provides a unifying policy gradient perspective for ARL and offers practical guidance for building stable and reproducible LLM-based agent training pipelines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\ub9ac \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(ARL)\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uad50\uc721\uc758 \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc73c\ub85c \ube60\ub974\uac8c \uc8fc\ubaa9\ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\ub098, \ubd88\uc548\uc815\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubd95\uad34\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ub9ac \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(ARL)\uc758 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uace0, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud6c8\ub828 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "ARLArena\ub77c\ub294 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub808\uc2dc\ud53c\uc640 \uccb4\uacc4 \ubd84\uc11d \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \uc815\ucc45 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30\ub97c \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud575\uc2ec \uc124\uacc4 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\uc5ec \uac01\uac01\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "SAMPO\ub77c\ub294 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uc815\ucc45 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 ARL\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \ubd88\uc548\uc815\uc131 \uc6d0\uc778\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\uace0, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \ud6c8\ub828\uacfc \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 ARL\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569 \uc815\ucc45 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \uad00\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc7ac\ud604 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud6c8\ub828 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uad6c\ucd95\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc9c0\uce68\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ub9ac \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(ARL)\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud558\uace0 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc73c\ub85c \ube60\ub974\uac8c \uc8fc\ubaa9\ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd08\uae30 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uace0\ubb34\uc801\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, ARL\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ubd88\uc548\uc815\uc131\uc774 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ub192\uc544 \uc885\uc885 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubd95\uad34\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc9d1\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubd88\uc548\uc815\uc131\uc740 \ub354 \ud070 \ud658\uacbd\uacfc \ub354 \uae34 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ud638\ub77c\uc774\uc98c\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \ud655\uc7a5\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud558\uace0, \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \uc124\uacc4 \uc120\ud0dd\uc758 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \uc81c\uc57d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uba3c\uc800 ARLArena\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

To examine this process, we develop an agent-based model (ABM) to identify the minimal conditions under which hierarchy arises in dynamic multi-agent systems, focusing on the roles of initial heterogeneity and mutation amplitude across generations. Hierarchical organisation is quantified using the Trophic Incoherence (TI) metric, which captures directional asymmetries in interaction networks. Our results show that even small individual differences can be amplified through repeated local interactions involving reproduction, competition, and cooperation, but that hierarchical order is markedly more sensitive to mutation amplitude than to initial heterogeneity. Across repeated trials, stable hierarchies reliably emerge only when mutation amplitude is sufficiently high, while initial heterogeneity primarily affects early formation rather than long-term persistence. Overall, these findings demonstrate how simple interaction rules can give rise to both the emergence and persistence of hierarchical organisation, providing a quantitative account of how structured inequality can develop from initially homogeneous populations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uac1c\ubcc4 \ubcc0\uc774\uac00 \uc0c1\uc704 \uc870\uc9c1 \uad6c\uc870\uc758 \ucd9c\ud604\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud560

Given the homogeneity of these models, this raises the question of whether aggregation unlocks access to a greater set of outputs than querying a single model. In this work, we investigate the power and limitations of aggregation within a stylized principal-agent framework. This framework models how the system designer can partially steer each agent's output through its reward function specification, but still faces limitations due to prompt engineering ability and model capabilities. Our analysis uncovers three natural mechanisms -- feasibility expansion, support expansion, and binding set contraction -- through which aggregation expands the set of outputs that are elicitable by the system designer. We prove that any aggregation operation must implement one of these mechanisms in order to be elicitability-expanding, and that strengthened versions of these mechanisms provide necessary and sufficient conditions that fully characterize elicitability-expansion. Finally, we provide an empirical illustration of our findings for LLMs deployed in a toy reference-generation task. Altogether, our results take a step towards characterizing when compound AI systems can overcome limitations in model capabilities and in prompt engineering.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774

While recent systems incorporate large language models (LLMs), they are still prompt-based, deterministic pipelines that underutilize reasoning capability. We present MemoPhishAgent (MPA), a memory-augmented multi-modal LLM agent that dynamically orchestrates phishing-specific tools and leverages episodic memories of past reasoning trajectories to guide decisions on recurring and novel threats. On two public datasets, MPA outperforms three state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines, improving recall by 13.6%. To better reflect realistic, user-facing phishing detection performance, we further evaluate MPA on a benchmark of real-world suspicious URLs actively crawled from five social media platforms, where it improves recall by 20%. Detailed analysis shows episodic memory contributes up to 27% recall gain without introducing additional computational overhead. The ablation study confirms the necessity of the agent-based approach compared to prompt-based baselines and validates the effectiveness of our tool design. Finally, MPA is deployed in production, processing 60K targeted high-risk URLs weekly, and achieving 91.44% recall, providing proactive protection for millions of customers.

Diffusion-based generative models have recently shown strong potential for capturing multimodal futures, yet existing approaches such as cVMD suffer from slow sampling, limited exploitation of generative diversity and brittle scenario encodings.\n  This work introduces cVMDx, an enhanced diffusion-based trajectory prediction framework that improves efficiency, robustness and multimodal predictive capability. Through DDIM sampling, cVMDx achieves up to a 100x reduction in inference time, enabling practical multi-sample generation for uncertainty estimation. A fitted Gaussian Mixture Model further provides tractable multimodal predictions from the generated trajectories. In addition, a CVQ-VAE variant is evaluated for scenario encoding.

The emerging paradigm of proactive intelligence, where agents autonomously anticipate needs and initiate actions, represents the next frontier for mobile agents. However, its development is critically bottlenecked by the lack of benchmarks that can address real-world complexity and enable objective, executable evaluation. To overcome these challenges, we introduce ProactiveMobile, a comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically advance research in this domain. ProactiveMobile formalizes the proactive task as inferring latent user intent across four dimensions of on-device contextual signals and generating an executable function sequence from a comprehensive function pool of 63 APIs. The benchmark features over 3,660 instances of 14 scenarios that embrace real-world complexity through multi-answer annotations. To ensure quality, a team of 30 experts conducts a final audit of the benchmark, verifying factual accuracy, logical consistency, and action feasibility, and correcting any non-compliant entries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our fine-tuned Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct achieves a success rate of 19.15%, outperforming o1 (15.71%) and GPT-5 (7.39%).

Even though metrics of responsibility tailored to spatial interactions have been proposed, they are mostly focused on the responsibility of individual agents. Metrics of causal responsibility focusing on individuals fail in cases of causal overdeterminism -- when many actors simultaneously cause an outcome. To fill the gaps in causal responsibility left by individual-focused metrics, we formulate a metric for the causal responsibility of groups. To identify assertive agents that are causally responsible for the trajectory of an affected agent, we further formalise the types of assertive influences and propose a tiering algorithm for systematically identifying assertive agents. Finally, we use scenario-based simulations to illustrate the benefits of considering groups and how the emergence of group effects vary with interaction dynamics and the proximity of agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc790\ub3d9\ucc28\uc640 \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c \ub85c\ubd07\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uacf5\uac04\uc801 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ucc45\uc784\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c \uc8fc\uc81c\ub85c \ubd80\uac01\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uacf5\uac04\uc801 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c \ucc45\uc784\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc2a4\uac00 \uc81c\uc548\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc774 \uac1c\ubcc4 \ud589\uc704\uc790\uc758 \ucc45\uc784\uc5d0\ub9cc \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uac1c\ubcc4 \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc6d0\uc778 \ucc45\uc784\uc758 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \uba54\uc6b0\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc758 \uc6d0\uc778 \ucc45\uc784 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc2a4\ub97c \uc218\ub9bd\ud558\uace0, assertive influence\uc758 \uc720\ud615\uc744 \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ud55c \ud6c4 assertive agents\ub97c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uacc4\uce35 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624 \uae30\ubc18 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud560 \ub54c\uc758 \uc774\uc810\uacfc \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559 \ubc0f \ud589\uc704\uc790 \uac04\uc758 \uadfc\uc811\uc131\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc9d1\ub2e8 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc758 \ubc1c\uc0dd \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \ub2ec\ub77c\uc9c4\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uacf5\uac04\uc801 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc758 \ucc45\uc784\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uae30\uc5ec\ud558\uba70, \uac1c\ubcc4\uc801 \ucc45\uc784\uc5d0 \uad6d\ud55c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc2dc\uac01\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc790\uc728 \ucc28\ub7c9\uacfc \uc778\uac04\uacfc \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c \ub85c\ubd07\uc758 \ub3c4\ub798\ub97c \uc54c\ub9ac\uba70, \uacf5\uac04\uc801 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ucc45\uc784\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c \uc8fc\uc81c\ub85c \ubd80\uac01\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uacf5\uac04\uc801 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucd98 \ucc45\uc784 \uc9c0\ud45c\uac00 \uc81c\uc548\ub418\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc740 \uac1c\ubcc4 \ud589\uc704\uc790\uc758 \ucc45\uc784\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uac1c\ubcc4\uc801 \uc6d0\uc778 \ucc45\uc784\uc740 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ud589\uc704\uc790\uac00 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud560 \ub54c \uc2e4\ud328\ud55c\ub2e4. \uac1c\ubcc4 \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \uc9c0\ud45c\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc6d0\uc778 \ucc45\uc784\uc758 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \uba54\uc6b0\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc758 \uc6d0\uc778 \ucc45\uc784\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc9c0\ud45c\ub97c \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubc1b\ub294 \ud589\uc704\uc790\uc758 \uacbd\ub85c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc6d0\uc778 \ucc45\uc784\uc774 \uc788\ub294 assertive agents\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 assertive influences\uc758 \uc720\ud615\uc744 \ub354 \ud615\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uace0 assertive agents\ub97c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uacc4\uce35 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c, \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624 \uae30\ubc18 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud560 \ub54c\uc758 \uc774\uc810\uacfc \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559 \ubc0f \ud589\uc704\uc790 \uac04\uc758 \uadfc\uc811\uc131\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc9d1\ub2e8 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc758 \ubc1c\uc0dd \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ub2ec\ub77c\uc9c0\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc124\uba85\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

We formulate this security challenge as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), where adversarial intent is a latent variable inferred from noisy multi-stage observations. We introduce MMA-RAG^T, an inference-time control framework governed by a Modular Trust Agent (MTA) that maintains an approximate belief state via structured LLM reasoning. Operating as a model-agnostic overlay, MMA-RAGT mediates a configurable set of internal checkpoints to enforce stateful defence-in-depth. Extensive evaluation on 43,774 instances demonstrates a 6.50x average reduction factor in Attack Success Rate relative to undefended baselines, with negligible utility cost. Crucially, a factorial ablation validates our theoretical bounds: while statefulness and spatial coverage are individually necessary (26.4 pp and 13.6 pp gains respectively), stateless multi-point intervention can yield zero marginal benefit under homogeneous stateless filtering when checkpoint detections are perfectly correlated.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ube44\uc0c1\ud0dc

Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a common approach for injecting such agentic capabilities, but typically under tightly controlled training setups. It often depends on carefully constructed task-solution pairs and substantial human supervision, which creates a fundamental obstacle to open-ended self-evolution toward superintelligent systems. In this paper, we propose Tool-R0 framework for training general purpose tool-calling agents from scratch with self-play RL, under a zero-data assumption. Initialized from the same base LLM, Tool-R0 co-evolves a Generator and a Solver with complementary rewards: one proposes targeted challenging tasks at the other's competence frontier and the other learns to solve them with real-world tool calls. This creates a self-evolving cycle that requires no pre-existing tasks or datasets. Evaluation on different tool-use benchmarks show that Tool-R0 yields 92.5 relative improvement over the base model and surpasses fully supervised tool-calling baselines under the same setting. Our work further provides empirical insights into self-play LLM agents by analyzing co-evolution, curriculum dynamics, and scaling behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "Tool-R0 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ud15c\ud50c\ub9bf \uc5c6\uc774 \uc790\uae30 \ud50c\ub808\uc774 RL\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc77c\ubc18 \ub3c4\uad6c \ud638\ucd9c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ucc98\uc74c\ubd80\ud130 \ud6c8\ub828\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc8fc\uc785\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "Tool-R0\ub294 \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \uae30\ubcf8 LLM\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd08\uae30\ud654\ub418\uc5b4 \ubcf4\uc644\uc801\uc778 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c Generator\uc640 Solver\ub97c \uacf5\ub3d9 \uc9c4\ud654\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "Tool-R0\ub294 \uae30\ubcf8 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 92.5\uc758 \uc0c1\ub300\uc801 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0 \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc644\uc804\ud788 \uac10\ub3c5\ub41c \ub3c4\uad6c \ud638\ucd9c \uae30\uc900\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc790\uae30 \ud50c\ub808\uc774 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uae30\ubc18\uc774 \ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc740 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \uc8fc\uc785\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \ub4f1\uc7a5\ud588\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucca0\uc800\ud788 \ud1b5\uc81c\ub41c \ud6c8\ub828 \uc124\uc815 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc9d1\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uc2e0\uc911\ud558\uac8c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \uc791\uc5c5-\ud574\uacb0 \uc30d\uacfc \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc778\uac04 \uac10\ub3c5\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \ucd08\uc9c0\ub2a5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \uc5f4\ub9b0 \uc790\uae30 \uc9c4\ud654\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uc7a5\uc560\ubb3c\uc744 \ud615\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 Tool-R0 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc81c\ub85c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uac00\uc815 \ud558\uc5d0 \uc790\uae30 \ud50c\ub808\uc774 RL\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc77c\ubc18 \ubaa9\uc801\uc758 \ub3c4\uad6c \ud638\ucd9c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ucc98\uc74c\ubd80\ud130 \ud6c8\ub828\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, we still lack a deep understanding of the effects of adoption of these technologies. In this paper, we introduce a general computational framework, the 2-Step Agent, which models the effects of AI-assisted decision making. Our framework uses Bayesian methods for causal inference to model 1) how a prediction on a new observation affects the beliefs of a rational Bayesian agent, and 2) how this change in beliefs affects the downstream decision and subsequent outcome. Using this framework, we show by simulations how a single misaligned prior belief can be sufficient for decision support to result in worse downstream outcomes compared to no decision support. Our results reveal several potential pitfalls of AI-driven decision support and highlight the need for thorough model documentation and proper user training.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc608\uce21\uc774 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uacfc \uadf8\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 2\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AI \uc9c0\uc6d0 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc758 \ucc44\ud0dd\uc774 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uae4a\uc740 \uc774\ud574 \ubd80\uc871\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud568\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc778\uacfc \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uad00\uce21 \uc608\uce21\uc774 \ud569\ub9ac\uc801\uc778 \ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc2e0\ub150\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub2e8\uc77c \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \uc0ac\uc804 \uc2e0\ub150\uc774 \uc758\uc0ac \uc9c0\uc6d0\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ub354 \ub098\uc05c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "AI \uae30\ubc18 \uc758\uc0ac \uc9c0\uc6d0\uc758 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801\uc778 \ud568\uc815\uc744 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b4\uace0, \ucca0\uc800\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378 \ubb38\uc11c\ud654 \ubc0f \uc801\uc808\ud55c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uad50\uc721\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc99d\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc740 AI \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uae30\uc220\uc758 \ucc44\ud0dd\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uae4a\uc740 \uc774\ud574\ub294 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 AI \uc9c0\uc6d0 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 2\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc778\uacfc \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec 1) \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uad00\uce21\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc608\uce21\uc774 \ud569\ub9ac\uc801\uc778 \ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc2e0\ub150\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uacfc 2) \uc774 \uc2e0\ub150\uc758 \ubcc0\ud654\uac00 \ud558\uc704 \uacb0\uc815\uacfc \uc774\ud6c4 \uacb0\uacfc\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e8\uc77c \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \uc0ac\uc804 \uc2e0\ub150\uc774 \uc758\uc0ac \uc9c0\uc6d0\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ub354 \ub098\uc05c \ud558\uc704 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 AI \uae30\ubc18 \uc758\uc0ac \uc9c0\uc6d0\uc758 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801\uc778 \ud568\uc815\uc744 \ubc1d\ud788\uace0 \ucca0\uc800\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378 \ubb38\uc11c\ud654\uc640 \uc801\uc808\ud55c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uad50\uc721\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

State model and message model are the core components of communication protocols, which also have significant impacts on protocol fuzzing. In this work, we propose APFuzz (Automatic greybox Protocol Fuzzer) with novel designs to increase the smartness of greybox protocol fuzzers from the perspectives of both the state model and the message model. On the one hand, APFuzz employs a two-stage process of static and dynamic analysis to automatically identify state variables, which are then used to infer an accurate state model during fuzzing. On the other hand, APFuzz introduces field-level mutation operations for binary protocols, leveraging message structure awareness enabled by Large Language Models.

We answer with a reliability level -- a single number per system-task pair, derived from self-consistency sampling and conformal calibration, that serves as a black-box deployment gate with exact, finite-sample, distribution-free guarantees. Self-consistency sampling reduces uncertainty exponentially; conformal calibration guarantees correctness within 1/(n+1) of the target level, regardless of the system's errors -- made transparently visible through larger answer sets for harder questions. Weaker models earn lower reliability levels (not accuracy -- see Definition 2.4): GPT-4.1 earns 94.6% on GSM8K and 96.8% on TruthfulQA, while GPT-4.1-nano earns 89.8% on GSM8K and 66.5% on MMLU.

In practice, LTV data patterns vary across decision scenarios. As a result, practitioners often build complex, scenario-specific pipelines and iterate over feature processing, objective design, and tuning. This process is expensive and hard to transfer. We propose AgentLTV, an agent-based unified search-and-evolution framework for automated LTV modeling. AgentLTV treats each candidate solution as an {executable pipeline program}. LLM-driven agents generate code, run and repair pipelines, and analyze execution feedback. Two decision agents coordinate a two-stage search. The Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) stage explores a broad space of modeling choices under a fixed budget, guided by the Polynomial Upper Confidence bounds for Trees criterion and a Pareto-aware multi-metric value function. The Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) stage refines the best MCTS program via island-based evolution with crossover, mutation, and migration. Experiments on a large-scale proprietary dataset and a public benchmark show that AgentLTV consistently discovers strong models across ranking and error metrics. Online bucket-level analysis further indicates improved ranking consistency and value calibration, especially for high-value and negative-LTV segments. We summarize practitioner-oriented takeaways: use MCTS for rapid adaptation to new data patterns, use EA for stable refinement, and validate deployment readiness with bucket-level ranking and calibration diagnostics. The proposed AgentLTV has been successfully deployed online.", "AI": {"tldr": "AgentLTV\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9 LTV \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \ud1b5\ud569 \uac80\uc0c9 \ubc0f \uc9c4\ud654 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uac01 \ud6c4\ubcf4 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc73c\ub85c \ucde8\uae09\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub97c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LTV \uc608\uce21\uc740 \uad11\uace0, \ucd94\ucc9c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ubc0f \uc804\uc790 \uc0c1\uac70\ub798\uc5d0\uc11c \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc911\uc694\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc2e4\uc81c\ub85c LTV \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud328\ud134\uc740 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ub2e4\uc591\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "AgentLTV\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131, \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uc2e4\ud589 \ubc0f \uc218\uc815, \uc2e4\ud589 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uba70, \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ub450 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc758 \uac80\uc0c9\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4.

Preprint", "summary": "Robust watermarking is critical for intellectual property protection, whereas existing methods face a severe vulnerability against regeneration-based AIGC attacks. We identify that existing methods fail because they entangle the watermark with high-frequency cover texture, which is susceptible to being rewritten during generative purification. To address this, we propose WaterVIB, a theoretically grounded framework that reformulates the encoder as an information sieve via the Variational Information Bottleneck. Instead of overfitting to fragile cover details, our approach forces the model to learn a Minimal Sufficient Statistic of the message. This effectively filters out redundant cover nuances prone to generative shifts, retaining only the essential signal invariant to regeneration. We theoretically prove that optimizing this bottleneck is a necessary condition for robustness against distribution-shifting attacks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WaterVIB significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior zero-shot resilience against unknown diffusion-based editing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc218\ubd84\uc2e4\uc218 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud55c \ubc29\uc218 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 WaterVIB\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc815\uc218 \uc7ac\uc0b0 \ubcf4\ud638\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud0b9\uc774 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc911\uc694\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc774 \uc7ac\uc0dd \uae30\ubc18 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "WaterVIB\ub294 \ubcc0\ubd84 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1(Variational Information Bottleneck)\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc778\ucf54\ub354\ub97c \uc815\ubcf4 \uccb4\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "WaterVIB\ub294 \uc0c1\ud0dc-of-the-art \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uc54c\ub824\uc9c0\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ud655\uc0b0 \uae30\ubc18 \ud3b8\uc9d1\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud0c1\uc6d4\ud55c \uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7 \ubcf5\uc6d0\ub825\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ubc30\ud3ec \uc774\ub3d9 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacac\uace0\uc131\uc744 \ud655\ubcf4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc774 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc99d\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud0b9\uc740 \uc9c0\uc801 \uc7ac\uc0b0 \ubcf4\ud638\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uc7ac\uc0dd \uae30\ubc18 AIGC \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc774 \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uace0\uc8fc\ud30c \ucee4\ubc84 \ud14d\uc2a4\ucc98\uc640 \uc5bd\ud788\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \uc0dd\uc131 \uc815\ud654 \uc911\uc5d0 \uc7ac\uc791\uc131\ub420 \uc704\ud5d8\uc5d0 \ucc98\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc2e4\ud328\ud558\ub294 \uc774\uc720\ub97c \ud655\uc778\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubcc0\ubd84 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc778\ucf54\ub354\ub97c \uc815\ubcf4 \uccb4\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 WaterVIB\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucde8\uc57d\ud55c \ucee4\ubc84 \uc138\ubd80\uc0ac\ud56d\uc5d0 \uacfc\uc801\ud569\ud558\ub294 \ub300\uc2e0, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0\uc758 \ucd5c\uc18c \ucda9\ubd84 \ud1b5\uacc4(Minimal Sufficient Statistic)\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uac15\uc81c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub85c\uc368 \uc0dd\uc131\uc801 \ubcc0\ud658\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud55c \uc911\ubcf5 \ucee4\ubc84 \ub258\uc559\uc2a4\ub97c \ud544\ud130\ub9c1\ud558\uace0, \uc7ac\uc0dd\uc5d0 \ubd88\ubcc0\uc778 \ud544\uc218 \uc2e0\ud638\ub9cc\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \ubcd1\ubaa9\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ubd84\ud3ec \uc774\ub3d9 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uacac\uace0\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud544\uc694 \uc870\uac74\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc99d\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc WaterVIB\uac00 \uc0c1\ud0dc-of-the-art \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, \uc54c\ub824\uc9c0\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ud655\uc0b0 \uae30\ubc18 \ud3b8\uc9d1\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7 \ubcf5\uc6d0\ub825\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

In this paper, we introduce a novel sequential training scheme and MARL architecture, which learns from multiple perspectives on different hierarchy levels. We propose the Hierarchical Lead Critic (HLC) - inspired by natural emerging distributions in team structures, where following high-level objectives combines with low-level execution. HLC demonstrates that introducing multiple hierarchies, leveraging local and global perspectives, can lead to improved performance with high sample efficiency and robust policies.

Our method belongs to the family of independence Metropolis-Hastings (IMH) sampling algorithms, which are common in Bayesian inference. Relying on the existence of an approximate posterior distribution that is cheaper to sample from but may have significant bias, we introduce Proximal-IMH, a scheme that removes this bias by correcting samples from the approximate posterior through an auxiliary optimization problem. This yields a local adjustment that trades off adherence to the exact model against stability around the approximate reference point. For idealized settings, we prove that the proximal correction tightens the match between approximate and exact posteriors, thereby improving acceptance rates and mixing. The method applies to both linear and nonlinear input-output operators and is particularly suitable for inverse problems where exact posterior sampling is too expensive. We present numerical experiments including multimodal and data-driven priors with nonlinear input-output operators. The results show that Proximal-IMH reliably outperforms existing IMH variants.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubc14\uc774\uc5b4\uc2a4 \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0\uc744 \uc704\ud55c Proximal-IMH \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uacfc\ud559, \uacf5\ud559, \uc774\ubbf8\uc9d5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \uc5ed \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \ud6c4\ubc29 \ubd84\ud3ec \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uace0\ub824\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc720\ub3c4\ub41c \uadfc\uc0ac \ud6c4\ubc29 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ubc14\uc774\uc5b4\uc2a4\ub97c \uc81c\uac70\ud558\ub294 Proximal-IMH \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "Proximal-IMH\ub294 \uae30\uc874 IMH \ubcc0\ud615\ub4e4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uc788\uac8c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ud6c4\ubc29 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uc774 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ud070 \uc5ed \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc801\ud569\ud558\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uacfc\ud559, \uacf5\ud559 \ubc0f \uc774\ubbf8\uc9d5\uc758 \ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \uc5ed \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \ud6c4\ubc29 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uace0\ub824\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0\uc11c \ud754\ud788 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \ub3c5\ub9bd \uba54\ud2b8\ub85c\ud3f4\ub9ac\uc2a4-\ud5e4\uc774\uc2a4\ud305\uc2a4(IMH) \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \uc9d1\ud569\uc5d0 \uc18d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \uc801\uac8c \ub4dc\ub294 \uadfc\uc0ac \ud6c4\ubc29 \ubd84\ud3ec\uac00 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ubc14\uc774\uc5b4\uc2a4\uac00 \ud074 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubcf4\uc870 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uadfc\uc0ac \ud6c4\ubc29\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \uc218\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 \ubc14\uc774\uc5b4\uc2a4\ub97c \uc81c\uac70\ud558\ub294 Proximal-IMH \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc900\uc218\uc640 \uadfc\uc0ac \ucc38\uc870 \uc9c0\uc810 \uc8fc\uc704\uc758 \uc548\uc815\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\ub294 \uc9c0\uc5ed \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294, \uadfc\uc0ac \uc218\uc815\uc774 \uadfc\uc0ac\uc640 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ud6c4\ubc29 \uac04\uc758 \uc77c\uce58\ub97c \uac15\ud654\uc2dc\ucf1c \uc218\uc6a9\ub960\uacfc \ud63c\ud569\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud568\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc120\ud615 \ubc0f \ube44\uc120\ud615 \uc785\ub825-\ucd9c\ub825 \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc790 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uba70, \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ud6c4\ubc29 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uc774 \ub108\ubb34 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4dc\ub294 \uc5ed \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ud2b9\ud788 \uc801\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ube44\uc120\ud615 \uc785\ub825-\ucd9c\ub825 \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc790\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ubc0f \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18 \uc0ac\uc804\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ub41c \uc218\uce58 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 Proximal-IMH\uac00 \uae30\uc874 IMH \ubcc0\ud615\ub4e4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uc788\uac8c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

We develop county-ready surrogates that learn directly from exascale ABM trajectories using Universal Differential Equations (UDEs): mechanistic SEIR-family ODEs with a neural-parameterized contact rate $\u03ba_\u03c6(u,t)$ (no additive residual). Our contributions are threefold: we adapt multiple shooting and an observer-based prediction-error method (PEM) to stabilize identification of neural-augmented epidemiological dynamics across intervention-driven regime shifts; we enforce positivity and mass conservation and show the learned contact-rate parameterization yields a well-posed vector field; and we quantify accuracy, calibration, and compute against ABM ensembles and UDE baselines. On a representative ExaEpi scenario, PEM-UDE reduces mean MSE by 77% relative to single-shooting UDE (3.00 vs. 13.14) and by 20% relative to MS-UDE (3.75). Reliability improves in parallel: empirical coverage of ABM $10$-$90$% and $25$-$75$% bands rises from 0.68/0.43 (UDE) and 0.79/0.55 (MS-UDE) to 0.86/0.61 with PEM-UDE and 0.94/0.69 with MS+PEM-UDE, indicating calibrated uncertainty rather than overconfident fits. Inference runs in seconds on commodity CPUs (20-35 s per $\\sim$90-day forecast), enabling nightly ''what-if'' sweeps on a laptop.

This gap stems from two limitations: a shortage of high-quality, action-aligned reasoning data, and the direct adoption of generic post-training pipelines that overlook the unique challenges of GUI agents. We identify two fundamental issues in these pipelines: (i) standard SFT with CoT reasoning often hurts grounding, and (ii) step-wise RLVR-tyle training faces partial verifiability, where multiple actions can be correct but only a single demonstrated action is used for verification. This makes offline step-wise metrics weak predictors of online task success. In this work, we present GUI-Libra, a tailored training recipe that addresses these challenges. First, to mitigate the scarcity of action-aligned reasoning data, we introduce a data construction and filtering pipeline and release a curated 81K GUI reasoning dataset. Second, to reconcile reasoning with grounding, we propose action-aware SFT that mixes reasoning-then-action and direct-action data and reweights tokens to emphasize action and grounding. Third, to stabilize RL under partial verifiability, we identify the overlooked importance of KL regularization in RLVR and show that a KL trust region is critical for improving offline-to-online predictability; we further introduce success-adaptive scaling to downweight unreliable negative gradients. Across diverse web and mobile benchmarks, GUI-Libra consistently improves both step-wise accuracy and end-to-end task completion.

However, due to fundamental challenges in modality alignment, existing methods often struggle to effectively incorporate multimodal data into predictions, particularly textual information that has a causal influence on time series fluctuations, such as emergency reports and policy announcements. In this paper, we reflect on the role of textual information in numerical forecasting and propose Time series transformers with Multimodal Mixture-of-Experts, TiMi, to unleash the causal reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Concretely, TiMi utilizes LLMs to generate inferences on future developments, which serve as guidance for time series forecasting. To seamlessly integrate both exogenous factors and time series into predictions, we introduce a Multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (MMoE) module as a lightweight plug-in to empower Transformer-based time series models for multimodal forecasting, eliminating the need for explicit representation-level alignment. Experimentally, our proposed TiMi demonstrates consistent state-of-the-art performance on sixteen real-world multimodal forecasting benchmarks, outperforming advanced baselines while offering both strong adaptability and interpretability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0\uc11c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc815\ubcf4\uc758 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ubc18\uc601\ud558\uace0 LLM\uc758 \uc778\uacfc \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 TiMi\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud568.", "motivation": "\uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \ub2e8\uc77c \ubaa8\ub2ec \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud560 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc774 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubaa8\ub2ec \uc815\ub82c\uc758 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uc774\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc74c.", "method": "TiMi\ub294 LLM\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubbf8\ub798\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uac00\uc774\ub4dc\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uba70, MMoE \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec Transformer \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud568.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c TiMi\ub294 16\uac1c\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc138\uacc4 \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \uc608\uce21 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, \uace0\uae09 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc \ub2ec\uc131\ud568.", "conclusion": "\uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc801\uc751\uc131 \ubc0f \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 TiMi\ub294 \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc774 \ub428.", "translated_summary": "\uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc608\uce21\uc740 \ub2e4\ub978 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\uc5d0 \ub0b4\uc7ac\ub41c \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub2e8\uc77c \ubaa8\ub2ec \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud560 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc73c\ub85c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc8fc\ubaa9\uc744 \ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0 \uc815\ub82c\uc758 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \ud2b9\ud788 \uae34\uae09 \ubcf4\uace0\uc11c \ubc0f \uc815\ucc45 \ubc1c\ud45c\uc640 \uac19\uc774 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc5d0 \uc778\uacfc\uc801 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc22b\uc790 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0\uc11c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc815\ubcf4\uc758 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ubc18\uc601\ud558\uace0 LLM\uc758 \uc778\uacfc \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \ud63c\ud569 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \ud0c0\uc784 \uc2dc\ub9ac\uc988 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30(TiMi)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c TiMi\ub294 LLM\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubbf8\ub798 \ubc1c\uc804\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uac00\uc774\ub4dc\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc678\uc0dd\uc801 \uc694\uc778\uacfc \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4\uc744 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0 \uc6d0\ud65c\ud558\uac8c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Transformer \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc704\ud574 MMoE \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc778 \ud45c\ud604 \uc218\uc900 \uc815\ub82c \uc5c6\uc774 \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uacbd\ub7c9 \ud50c\ub7ec\uadf8\uc778\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc81c\uc548\ub41c TiMi\ub294 16\uac1c\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \uc608\uce21 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uace0\uae09 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc801\uc751\uc131\uacfc \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, procuring sufficient and high-quality data poses significant challenges due to the labor-intensive and costly nature of data acquisition. Additionally, leveraging language models to annotate real documents raises concerns about data privacy. Synthetic document generation has emerged as a promising, privacy-preserving alternative. We propose DocDjinn, a novel framework for controllable synthetic document generation using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) that produces annotated documents from unlabeled seed samples. Our approach generates visually plausible and semantically consistent synthetic documents that follow the distribution of an existing source dataset through clustering-based seed selection with parametrized sampling. By enriching documents with realistic diffusion-based handwriting and contextual visual elements via semantic-visual decoupling, we generate diverse, high-quality annotated synthetic documents. We evaluate across eleven benchmarks spanning key information extraction, question answering, document classification, and document layout analysis. To our knowledge, this is the first work demonstrating that VLMs can generate faithful annotated document datasets at scale from unlabeled seeds that can effectively enrich or approximate real, manually annotated data for diverse document understanding tasks. We show that with only 100 real training samples, our framework achieves on average $87\\%$ of the performance of the full real-world dataset.

Conditional tabular GAN (CTGAN) have been the most popular variant but struggle to effectively navigate the risk-utility trade-off. Bayesian GAN have received less attention for tabular data, but have been explored with unstructured data such as images and text. The most used technique employed in Bayesian GAN is Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), but it is computationally intensive, particularly in terms of weight storage. In this paper, we introduce Gaussian Approximation of CTGAN (GACTGAN), an integration of the Bayesian posterior approximation technique using Stochastic Weight Averaging-Gaussian (SWAG) within the CTGAN generator to synthesise tabular data, reducing computational overhead after the training phase. We demonstrate that GACTGAN yields better synthetic data compared to CTGAN, achieving better preservation of tabular structure and inferential statistics with less privacy risk. These results highlight GACTGAN as a simpler, effective implementation of Bayesian tabular synthesis.", "AI": {"tldr": "GACTGAN\uc740 Bayesian \ud6c4\ud589 \uadfc\uc0ac \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec CTGAN \uc0dd\uc131\uae30 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ud45c \ud615\uc2dd \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud569\uc131\ud558\uace0, \ud6c8\ub828 \ud6c4 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uacfc\ubd80\ud558\ub97c \uc904\uc774\uba70, CTGAN\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc870\uac74\ubd80 \ud45c\ud615 GAN(CTGAN)\uc774 \ub9ac\uc2a4\ud06c-\uc720\ud2f8\ub9ac\ud2f0 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc808\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, Bayesian GAN\uc740 \ud45c \ud615\uc2dd \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad00\uc2ec\uc774 \uc801\ub2e4.", "method": "CTGAN \uc0dd\uc131\uae30 \ub0b4\uc5d0 Stochastic Weight Averaging-Gaussian(SWAG)\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c Bayesian \ud6c4\ud589 \uadfc\uc0ac \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec Gaussian Approximation of CTGAN(GACTGAN)\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "GACTGAN\uc740 CTGAN\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uba70, \ud45c \ud615\uc2dd \uad6c\uc870\uc640 \ucd94\ub860 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc758 \ubcf4\uc874\uc774 \ub354 \uc6b0\uc218\ud558\uace0 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ub178\ucd9c \uc704\ud5d8\uc774 \uc801\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "GACTGAN\uc740 Bayesian \ud45c \ud615\uc2dd \ud569\uc131\uc758 \ub354 \uac04\ub2e8\ud558\uace0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uad6c\ud604\uc73c\ub85c \uac15\uc870\ub41c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc0dd\uc131\uc801 \uc801\ub300 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(GAN)\uc740 \ud63c\ud569 \ud45c \ud615\uc2dd \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud569\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub9ce\uc740 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uc5b4 \uc654\ub2e4. \uc870\uac74\ubd80 \ud45c\ud615 GAN(CTGAN)\uc740 \uac00\uc7a5 \ub300\uc911\uc801\uc778 \ubcc0\ud615\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc \ub9ac\uc2a4\ud06c-\uc720\ud2f8\ub9ac\ud2f0 \uac70\ub798\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\ub294\ub2e4.

It is a valuable tool to gain a deeper understanding of diseases with a long disease trajectory, such as Alzheimer's disease. A key limitation of most disease progression models is that they are specific to a single data type (e.g., continuous data), thereby limiting their applicability to heterogeneous, real-world datasets. To address this limitation, we propose the Mixed Events model, a novel disease progression model that handles both discrete and continuous data types. This model is implemented within the Subtype and Stage Inference (SuStaIn) framework, resulting in Mixed-SuStaIn, enabling subtype and progression modeling. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Mixed-SuStaIn through simulation experiments and real-world data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, showing that it performs well on mixed datasets.
