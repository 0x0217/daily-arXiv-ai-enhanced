A structured thematic\nsynthesis revealed four categories of outcomes: (1) Convergent themes -\ncommitment-based demand signals, black-box trust barriers, and efficiency gains\nwere consistently emphasized across both datasets; (2) Partial overlaps -\nfounders worried about outliers being averaged away and the stress of real\ncustomer validation, while synthetic personas highlighted irrational blind\nspots and framed AI as a psychological buffer; (3) Human-only themes -\nrelational and advocacy value from early customer engagement and skepticism\ntoward moonshot markets; and (4) Synthetic-only themes - amplified false\npositives and trauma blind spots, where AI may overstate adoption potential by\nmissing negative historical experiences.\n  We interpret this comparative framework as evidence that LLM-driven personas\nconstitute a form of hybrid social simulation: more linguistically expressive\nand adaptable than traditional rule-based agents, yet bounded by the absence of\nlived history and relational consequence. Rather than replacing empirical\nstudies, we argue they function as a complementary simulation category -\ncapable of extending hypothesis space, accelerating exploratory validation, and\nclarifying the boundaries of cognitive realism in computational social science."}

Firstly, we demonstrate that the\nstandard HDP framework falls short when user data and privacy demands are\nallowed to be correlated. Secondly, to address this shortcoming, we propose an\nalternate framework, Add-remove Heterogeneous Differential Privacy (AHDP), that\njointly accounts for user data and privacy preference. We show that AHDP is\nrobust to possible correlations between data and privacy. Thirdly, we formalize\nthe guarantees of the proposed AHDP framework through an operational hypothesis\ntesting perspective. The hypothesis testing setup may be of independent\ninterest in analyzing other privacy frameworks as well. Fourthly, we show that\nthere exists non-trivial AHDP mechanisms that notably do not require prior\nknowledge of the data-privacy correlations. We propose some such mechanisms and\napply them to core statistical tasks such as mean estimation, frequency\nestimation, and linear regression. The proposed mechanisms are simple to\nimplement with minimal assumptions and modeling requirements, making them\nattractive for real-world use.

Within DRL-based TSC methods, two primary control\nparadigms are ``choose phase\" and ``switch\" strategies. Although the agent in\nthe choose phase paradigm selects the next active phase adaptively, this\nparadigm may result in unexpected phase sequences for drivers, disrupting their\nanticipation and potentially compromising safety at intersections. Meanwhile,\nthe switch paradigm allows the agent to decide whether to switch to the next\npredefined phase or extend the current phase. While this structure maintains a\nmore predictable order, it can lead to unfair and inefficient phase\nallocations, as certain movements may be extended disproportionately while\nothers are neglected. In this paper, we propose a DRL model, named Deep\nHierarchical Cycle Planner (DHCP), to allocate the traffic signal cycle\nduration hierarchically. A high-level agent first determines the split of the\ntotal cycle time between the North-South (NS) and East-West (EW) directions\nbased on the overall traffic state.

In contrast, absorptivity data from low-cost photodiodes correlate\nwith melt pool dynamics but is often too noisy for accurate prediction when\nused alone. In this paper, we propose a multimodal data fusion approach for\npredicting melt pool dynamics by combining high-fidelity X-ray data with\nlow-fidelity absorptivity data in the Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) process.\nOur multimodal learning framework integrates convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs) for spatial feature extraction from X-ray data with recurrent neural\nnetworks (RNNs) for temporal feature extraction from absorptivity signals,\nusing an early fusion strategy. The multimodal model is further used as a\ntransfer learning model to fine-tune the RNN model that can predict melt pool\ndynamics only with absorptivity, with greater accuracy compared to the\nmultimodal model.

However, even when optimized, these operators can be\nexpensive to execute on millions of records and their iterator execution\nsemantics make them ill-suited for interactive data analytics tasks. In another\nline of work, Deep Research systems have demonstrated an ability to answer\nnatural language question(s) over large datasets. These systems use one or more\nLLM agent(s) to plan their execution, process the dataset(s), and iteratively\nrefine their answer. However, these systems do not explicitly optimize their\nquery plans which can lead to poor plan execution. In order for AI-driven\nanalytics to excel, we need a runtime which combines the optimized execution of\nsemantic operators with the flexibility and more dynamic execution of Deep\nResearch systems. As a first step towards this vision, we build a prototype\nwhich enables Deep Research agents to write and execute optimized semantic\noperator programs. We evaluate our prototype and demonstrate that it can\noutperform a handcrafted semantic operator program and open Deep Research\nsystems on two basic queries. Compared to a standard open Deep Research agent,\nour prototype achieves up to 1.95x better F1-score.

Firstly, we demonstrate that the\nstandard HDP framework falls short when user data and privacy demands are\nallowed to be correlated. Secondly, to address this shortcoming, we propose an\nalternate framework, Add-remove Heterogeneous Differential Privacy (AHDP), that\njointly accounts for user data and privacy preference. We show that AHDP is\nrobust to possible correlations between data and privacy. Thirdly, we formalize\nthe guarantees of the proposed AHDP framework through an operational hypothesis\ntesting perspective. The hypothesis testing setup may be of independent\ninterest in analyzing other privacy frameworks as well. Fourthly, we show that\nthere exists non-trivial AHDP mechanisms that notably do not require prior\nknowledge of the data-privacy correlations. We propose some such mechanisms and\napply them to core statistical tasks such as mean estimation, frequency\nestimation, and linear regression. The proposed mechanisms are simple to\nimplement with minimal assumptions and modeling requirements, making them\nattractive for real-world use. Finally, we empirically evaluate proposed AHDP\nmechanisms, highlighting their trade-offs using LLM-generated synthetic\ndatasets, which we release for future research."}
