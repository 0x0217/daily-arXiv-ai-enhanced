The salient framework integrates\nthree specialized AI agents: a specification-matrix-conditioned question\ngenerator, a solver/explainer for detailed step-by-step reasoning, and a\npersonalized tutor that adapts to student performance. Beyond enabling\nself-paced student practice, V-Math supports teachers by generating innovative,\ncompliant exam questions and building diverse, high-quality question banks.\nThis reduces manual workload and enriches instructional resources. We describe\nthe system architecture, focusing on practice modes for learners and\nteacher-oriented features for question generation. Preliminary evaluations\ndemonstrate that V-Math produces matrix-aligned exams with high solution\naccuracy, delivers coherent explanations, and enhances the variety of practice\nmaterials. These results highlight its potential to support scalable, equitable\nmathematics preparation aligned with national standards while also empowering\nteachers through AI-assisted exam creation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubca0\ud2b8\ub0a8 \uace0\ub4f1\ud559\uc0dd\ub4e4\uc774 \uad6d\uac00 \uace0\ub4f1\ud559\uad50 \uc878\uc5c5 \uc218\ud559 \uc2dc\ud5d8\uc744 \uc900\ube44\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc744 \uc8fc\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc790\uc728\ud615 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c V-Math\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubca0\ud2b8\ub0a8 \uace0\ub4f1\ud559\uc0dd\ub4e4\uc774 \uad6d\uac00 \uace0\ub4f1\ud559\uad50 \uc878\uc5c5 \uc218\ud559 \uc2dc\ud5d8\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc900\ube44\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc804\ubb38 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c V-Math \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9: \uc9c8\ubb38 \uc0dd\uc131\uae30, \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0\uae30/\uc124\uba85\uae30, \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c \ud29c\ud130.", "result": "V-Math\ub294 \ub192\uc740 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc758 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \ub9e4\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc2a4 \uc815\ub82c \uc2dc\ud5d8\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uc77c\uad00\uc131 \uc788\ub294 \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc5f0\uc2b5 \uc790\ub8cc\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf30\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "V-Math\ub294 \uad6d\uac00 \ud45c\uc900\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucd98 \uacf5\uc815\ud55c \uc218\ud559 \uc900\ube44\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uace0, \uad50\uc0ac\ub97c AI \uc9c0\uc6d0 \uc2dc\ud5d8 \uc0dd\uc131 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub85c \uac15\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubca0\ud2b8\ub0a8 \uace0\ub4f1\ud559\uc0dd\ub4e4\uc774 \uad6d\uac00 \uace0\ub4f1\ud559\uad50 \uc878\uc5c5 \uc218\ud559 \uc2dc\ud5d8(NHSGMEs)\uc744 \uc900\ube44\ud558\ub294\ub370 \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc744 \uc8fc\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc790\uc728\ud615 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 V-Math\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc8fc\uc694 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc0ac\uc591 \ud589\ub82c \uc870\uac74\ud654 \uc9c8\ubb38 \uc0dd\uc131\uae30, \ub2e8\uacc4\ubcc4 \uc0ac\uace0\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud574\uacb0\uc0ac/\uc124\uba85\uae30, \ud559\uc0dd \uc131\uacfc\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\ud558\ub294 \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c \ud29c\ud130\ub77c\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc804\ubb38 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud559\uc0dd\uc758 \uc790\uae30 \uc8fc\ub3c4\ud615 \uc5f0\uc2b5\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud560 \ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c, V-Math\ub294 \ud601\uc2e0\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uaddc\uc815\uc744 \uc900\uc218\ud558\ub294 \uc2dc\ud5d8 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uba70, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \ubb38\uc81c \uc740\ud589\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uad50\uc0ac\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc218\uc791\uc5c5 \ubd80\ub2f4\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uace0 \uad50\uc721 \uc790\uc6d0\uc744 \ud48d\ubd80\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud559\uc2b5\uc790\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc5f0\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub4dc\uc640 \ubb38\uc81c \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uad50\uc0ac \uc911\uc2ec \uae30\ub2a5\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd98 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uc124\uba85\ud55c\ub2e4. \ucd08\uae30 \ud3c9\uac00\ub294 V-Math\uac00 \ub192\uc740 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub85c \ub9e4\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc2a4 \uc815\ub82c \uc2dc\ud5d8\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uc77c\uad00\uc131 \uc788\ub294 \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70 \uc5f0\uc2b5 \uc790\ub8cc\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uad6d\uac00 \uae30\uc900\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucd98 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uacf5\uc815\ud55c \uc218\ud559 \uc900\ube44\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uacfc \uad50\uc0ac\ub97c AI \uc9c0\uc6d0 \uc2dc\ud5d8 \uc0dd\uc131 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub85c \uac15\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

It allows\nLMMs to answer physical reasoning queries, such as the outcome of a potential\ncollision event from visual input. However, since parametric knowledge includes\nonly the physical laws seen during training, it is insufficient for reasoning\nwhen the inference scenario violates these physical laws. In contrast, humans\npossess the skill to adapt their physical reasoning to unseen physical\nenvironments from a few visual examples. This ability, which we refer to as\ninductive physical reasoning, is indispensable for LMMs if they are to replace\nhuman agents in safety-critical applications. Despite its importance, existing\nvisual benchmarks evaluate only the parametric knowledge in LMMs, and not\ninductive physical reasoning. To this end, we propose InPhyRe, the first visual\nquestion answering benchmark to measure inductive physical reasoning in LMMs.\nInPhyRe evaluates LMMs on their ability to predict the outcome of collision\nevents in algorithmically generated synthetic collision videos. By inspecting\n13 LMMs, InPhyRe informs us that (1) LMMs struggle to apply their limited\nparametric knowledge about universal physical laws to reasoning, (2) inductive\nphysical reasoning in LMMs is weak when demonstration samples violate universal\nphysical laws, and (3) inductive physical reasoning in LMMs suffers from\nlanguage bias and largely ignores the visual inputs, questioning the\ntrustworthiness of LMMs regarding visual inputs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub2e4\uc911\ubaa8\ub2ec \ubaa8\ub378(LMM)\uc740 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc911 \uad00\ucc30\ub41c

However, LLMs in the former\napproach struggle to handle extensive map data, while the latter shows limited\ncapability in understanding natural language preferences. Additionally, a more\ncritical challenge arises from the highly heterogeneous and unpredictable\nspatio-temporal distribution of users across the globe. In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel LLM-Assisted route Planning (LLMAP) system that employs an\nLLM-as-Parser to comprehend natural language, identify tasks, and extract user\npreferences and recognize task dependencies, coupled with a Multi-Step Graph\nconstruction with iterative Search (MSGS) algorithm as the underlying solver\nfor optimal route finding. Our multi-objective optimization approach adaptively\ntunes objective weights to maximize points of interest (POI) quality and task\ncompletion rate while minimizing route distance, subject to three key\nconstraints: user time limits, POI opening hours, and task dependencies. We\nconduct extensive experiments using 1,000 routing prompts sampled with varying\ncomplexity across 14 countries and 27 cities worldwide. The results demonstrate\nthat our approach achieves superior performance with guarantees across multiple\nconstraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 LLM-Assisted \uae38 \ucc3e\uae30 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uae30\ubc18 \uacbd\ub85c \uacc4\ud68d \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uacfc \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4 \uadf9\ubcf5.", "method": "LLM\uc744 \ud30c\uc11c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uc774\ud574, \uc791\uc5c5 \uc2dd\ubcc4, \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc120\ud638\ub3c4 \ucd94\ucd9c \ubc0f \uc791\uc5c5 \uc758\uc874\uc131 \uc778\uc2dd, \uc774\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c MSGS \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc73c\ub85c \ucd5c\uc801 \uacbd\ub85c \ud0d0\uc0c9.", "result": "1,000\uac1c\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uacbd\ub85c \uc694\uccad\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub41c \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc81c\uc57d \uc870\uac74 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ud655\uc778.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 POI \ud488\uc9c8\uacfc \uc791\uc5c5 \uc644\ub8cc\uc728\uc744 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uacbd\ub85c \uac70\ub9ac\ub97c \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\ubaa9\uc801 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ubaa9\ud45c\uac00 \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uae30\ubc18 \uacbd\ub85c \uacc4\ud68d\uc774 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc5f0\uad6c \ubd84\uc57c\ub85c \ub5a0\uc624\ub974\uac8c \ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud604\uc7ac \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 LLM\uc744 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc9c1\uc811 \uacbd\ub85c \uacc4\ud68d\uacfc \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uae30\ubc18 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uc804\ub7b5\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub69c\ub837\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc804\uc790\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 LLM\uc774 \ubc29\ub300\ud55c \uc9c0\ub3c4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ud6c4\uc790\ub294 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uc120\ud638\ub3c4\ub97c \uc774\ud574\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub354\ubd88\uc5b4, \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\ub4e4\uc774 \uc804 \uc138\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc608\uce21 \ubd88\uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc2dc\uacf5\uac04 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \ubcf4\uc774\ub294 \uac83 \ub610\ud55c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4\ub97c \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0, \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uba70, \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc120\ud638\ub3c4\ub97c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\uace0 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \uc778\uc2dd\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 LLM\uc744 \ud30c\uc11c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 LLM-Assisted \uae38 \ucc3e\uae30(LLMAP) \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ucd5c\uc801 \uacbd\ub85c \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uae30\ubcf8 \uc194\ubc84\ub85c Multi-Step Graph \uad6c\uc870\uc640 \ubc18\ubcf5 \uac80\uc0c9(MSGS) \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc800\ud76c\uc758 \ub2e4\ubaa9\uc801 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc81c\ud55c, POI \uc6b4\uc601 \uc2dc\uac04 \ubc0f \uc791\uc5c5 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc81c\uc57d \uc870\uac74\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud558\uc5ec POI \ud488\uc9c8\uacfc \uc791\uc5c5 \uc644\ub8cc\uc728\uc744 \ucd5c\ub300\ud654\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uacbd\ub85c \uac70\ub9ac\ub97c \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubaa9\ud45c \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub97c \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 14\uac1c\uad6d, 27\uac1c \ub3c4\uc2dc\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc774 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c 1,000\uac1c\uc758 \uacbd\ub85c \uc694\uccad\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc800\ud76c\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc81c\uc57d \uc870\uac74 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \ucd5c\uc0c1\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud568\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, systems remain fragmented and lack human-centred\nworkflows. To address these gaps, we introduce AIssistant, an agentic,\nopen-source Human-AI collaborative framework designed to simplify the\nend-to-end creation of scientific workflows. Since our development is still in\nan early stage, we present here the first experiments with AIssistant for\nperspective and review research papers in machine learning. Our system\nintegrates modular tools and agents for literature synthesis, section-wise\nexperimentation, citation management, and automatic LaTeX paper text\ngeneration, while maintaining human oversight at every stage to ensure\naccuracy, coherence, and scholarly rigour. We conducted a comprehensive\nevaluation across three layers: (1) Independent Human Review, following NeurIPS\ndouble-blind standards; (2) Automated LLM Review, using GPT-5 as a scalable\nhuman review proxy; and (3) Program Chair Oversight, where the chair monitors\nthe entire review process and makes final validation and acceptance decisions.\nThe results demonstrate that AIssistant improves drafting efficiency and\nthematic consistency. Nonetheless, Human-AI collaboration remains essential for\nmaintaining factual correctness, methodological soundness, and ethical\ncompliance.

However, to generate high-quality images,\nusers must still craft detailed prompts specifying scene, style, and\ncontext-often through multiple rounds of refinement. We propose PromptSculptor,\na novel multi-agent framework that automates this iterative prompt optimization\nprocess. Our system decomposes the task into four specialized agents that work\ncollaboratively to transform a short, vague user prompt into a comprehensive,\nrefined prompt. By leveraging Chain-of-Thought reasoning, our framework\neffectively infers hidden context and enriches scene and background details. To\niteratively refine the prompt, a self-evaluation agent aligns the modified\nprompt with the original input, while a feedback-tuning agent incorporates user\nfeedback for further refinement. Experimental results demonstrate that\nPromptSculptor significantly enhances output quality and reduces the number of\niterations needed for user satisfaction. Moreover, its model-agnostic design\nallows seamless integration with various T2I models, paving the way for\nindustrial applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "PromptSculptor\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uac00 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c \uc9e7\uace0 \ubaa8\ud638\ud55c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc815\uc81c\ub41c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub85c \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc0dd\uc131 AI\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc73c\ub85c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc811\uadfc\uc774 \ubbfc\uc8fc\ud654\ub418\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\ub4e4\uc774 \uc138\ubd80\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \uc791\uc131\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "PromptSculptor\ub294 \ub124 \uac1c\uc758 \uc804\ubb38 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ud611\ub825\ud558\uc5ec \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \uc815\uc81c\ud558\ub294 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.

To\naddress these challenges, we introduce a novel Agentic Artificial Intelligence\n(AAI) framework tailored for IoEV, where specialized agents collaborate to\ndeliver autonomous threat mitigation, robust analytics, and interpretable\ndecision support.

Despite these\nchanges, publicly available test cases remain scarce, due to security concerns\nand the significant effort required to anonymize real systems. Such limitations\ncall for generative tools that can jointly synthesize grid structure and nodal\ndynamics. However, modeling the joint distribution of network topology, branch\nattributes, bus properties, and dynamic load profiles remains a major\nchallenge, while preserving physical feasibility and avoiding prohibitive\ncomputational costs. We present PowerGrow, a co-generative framework that\nsignificantly reduces computational overhead while maintaining operational\nvalidity. The core idea is dependence decomposition: the complex joint\ndistribution is factorized into a chain of conditional distributions over\nfeasible grid topologies, time-series bus loads, and other system attributes,\nleveraging their mutual dependencies. By constraining the generation process at\neach stage, we implement a hierarchical graph beta-diffusion process for\nstructural synthesis, paired with a temporal autoencoder that embeds\ntime-series data into a compact latent space, improving both training stability\nand sample fidelity. Experiments across benchmark settings show that PowerGrow\nnot only outperforms prior diffusion models in fidelity and diversity but also\nachieves a 98.9\\% power flow convergence rate and improved N-1 contingency\nresilience. This demonstrates its ability to generate operationally valid and\nrealistic power grid scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "PowerGrow\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc804\ub825\ub9dd \uad6c\uc870\uc640

While historically effective, prior\nmethods fail to generalize to modern web environments. Single-page applications\n(SPAs) eliminate the paradigm of websites as sets of discrete pages,\nundermining page-based classification, and traffic from scripted browsers lacks\nthe behavioral richness seen in real user sessions. Our study reveals that\nusers exhibit highly diverse behaviors even on the same website, producing\ntraffic patterns that vary significantly across individuals. This behavioral\nentropy makes WFP a harder problem than previously assumed and highlights the\nneed for larger, more diverse, and representative datasets to achieve robust\nperformance. To address this, we propose a new paradigm: we drop\nsession-boundaries in favor of contiguous traffic segments and develop a\nscalable data generation pipeline using large language models (LLM) agents.\nThese multi-agent systems coordinate decision-making and browser interaction to\nsimulate realistic, persona-driven browsing behavior at 3--5x lower cost than\nhuman collection. We evaluate nine state-of-the-art WFP models on traffic from\n20 modern websites browsed by 30 real users, and compare training performance\nacross human, scripted, and LLM-generated datasets. All models achieve under\n10\\% accuracy when trained on scripted traffic and tested on human data. In\ncontrast, LLM-generated traffic boosts accuracy into the 80\\% range,\ndemonstrating strong generalization to real-world traces. Our findings indicate\nthat for modern WFP, model performance is increasingly bottlenecked by data\nquality, and that scalable, semantically grounded synthetic traffic is\nessential for capturing the

TripOptimizer employs a Variational Autoencoder\nfeaturing a triplane-based implicit neural representation for high-fidelity 3D\ngeometry reconstruction and a drag coefficient prediction head. Trained on\nDrivAerNet++, a large-scale dataset of 8,000 unique vehicle geometries with\ncorresponding drag coefficients computed via Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes\nsimulations, the model learns a latent representation that encodes\naerodynamically salient geometric features. We propose an optimization strategy\nthat modifies a subset of the encoder parameters to steer an initial geometry\ntowards a target drag value, and demonstrate its efficacy in case studies where\noptimized designs achieved drag coefficient reductions up to 11.8\\%. These\nresults were subsequently validated by using independent, high-fidelity\nComputational Fluid Dynamics simulations with more than 150 million cells. A\nkey advantage of the implicit representation is its inherent robustness to\ngeometric imperfections, enabling optimization of non-watertight meshes, a\nsignificant challenge for traditional adjoint-based methods.

The difficulty of these tasks is exemplified by\nbenchmarks like SWE-bench, where current LLMs still struggle to resolve\nreal-world issues.\n  A promising approach to enhance performance is test-time scaling (TTS), but\nits gains are heavily dependent on the diversity of model outputs.\n  While standard alignment methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)\nand Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) are effective at aligning model outputs\nwith human preferences, this process can come at the cost of reduced diversity,\nlimiting the effectiveness of TTS.\n  Additionally, existing preference optimization algorithms are typically\ndesigned for single-turn tasks and do not fully address the complexities of\nmulti-turn reasoning and tool integration required for interactive coding\nagents.\n  To bridge this gap, we introduce \\sys, an entropy-enhanced framework that\nadapts existing preference optimization algorithms to the multi-turn,\ntool-assisted setting.\n  \\sys augments the preference objective to explicitly preserve policy entropy\nand generalizes learning to optimize over multi-turn interactions rather than\nsingle-turn responses.\n  We validate \\sys by fine-tuning a diverse suite of models from different\nfamilies and sizes (up to 106B parameters).\n  To maximize performance gains from TTS, we further propose a hybrid\nbest-trajectory selection scheme combining a learned verifier model with model\nfree approaches.\n  On the \\swebench leaderboard, our approach establishes new state-of-the-art\nresults among open-weight models. A 30B parameter model trained with \\sys ranks\n1st on \\lite and 4th on \\verified on the open-weight leaderboard, surpassed\nonly by models with over 10x more parameters(\\eg$>$350B).", "AI":

While AI offers\npotential, most solutions remain opaque and poorly aligned with regulatory\nexpectations. This paper presents the design and deployment of an agentic AI\nsystem for FCC in digitally native financial platforms. Developed through an\nAction Design Research (ADR) process with a fintech firm and regulatory\nstakeholders, the system automates onboarding, monitoring, investigation, and\nreporting, emphasizing explainability, traceability, and compliance-by-design.\nUsing artifact-centric modeling, it assigns clearly bounded roles to autonomous\nagents and enables task-specific model routing and audit logging. The\ncontribution includes a reference architecture, a real-world prototype, and\ninsights into how Agentic AI can reconfigure FCC workflows under regulatory\nconstraints.

To increase multimodal model\nflexibility under high modality missingness, we introduce PerM-MoE, a novel\nsparse mixture-of-experts method that uses independent routers for each\nmodality in place of the conventional, single router. Using T1-weighted MRI,\nFLAIR, amyloid beta PET, and tau PET neuroimaging data from the Alzheimer's\nDisease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), we evaluate PerM-MoE, state-of-the-art\nFlex-MoE, and unimodal neuroimaging models on predicting two-year change in\nClinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) scores under varying levels of\nmodality missingness.

A key driver is the\ncognitive load on agents, who must navigate fragmented systems, troubleshoot\nmanually, and frequently place customers on hold. Existing AI-powered\nagent-assist tools are often reactive driven by static rules, simple prompting,\nor retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) without deeper contextual reasoning. We\nintroduce Agentic AI goal-driven, autonomous, tool-using systems that\nproactively support agents in real time. Unlike conventional approaches,\nAgentic AI identifies customer intent, triggers modular workflows, maintains\nevolving context, and adapts dynamically to conversation state. This paper\npresents a case study of Minerva CQ, a real-time Agent Assist product deployed\nin voice-based customer support. Minerva CQ integrates real-time transcription,\nintent and sentiment detection, entity recognition, contextual retrieval,\ndynamic customer profiling, and partial conversational summaries enabling\nproactive workflows and continuous context-building.

Among them is the SLH-DSA that was recently standardized by NIST\nand is favored for its conservative security foundations.\n  In this work, we present the first software-only universal forgery attack on\nSLH-DSA, leveraging Rowhammer-induced bit flips to corrupt the internal state\nand forge signatures. While prior work targeted embedded systems and required\nphysical access, our attack is software-only, targeting commodity desktop and\nserver hardware, significantly broadening the threat model. We demonstrate a\nfull end-to-end attack against all security levels of SLH-DSA in OpenSSL 3.5.1,\nachieving universal forgery for the highest security level after eight hours of\nhammering and 36 seconds of post-processing. Our post-processing is informed by\na novel complexity analysis that, given a concrete set of faulty signatures,\nidentifies the most promising computational path to pursue.\n  To enable the attack, we introduce Swage, a modular and extensible framework\nfor implementing end-to-end Rowhammer-based fault attacks. Swage abstracts and\nautomates key components of practical Rowhammer attacks. Unlike prior tooling,\nSwage is untangled from the attacked code, making it reusable and suitable for\nfrictionless analysis of different targets. Our findings highlight that even\ntheoretically sound PQC schemes can fail under real-world conditions,\nunderscoring the need for additional implementation hardening or hardware\ndefenses against Rowhammer.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 SLH-DSA\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uc804\uc6a9 \ubcf4\ud3b8\uc801 \uc704\uc870 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, Rowhammer\ub85c \uc720\ub3c4\ub41c \ube44\ud2b8 \ud50c\ub9bd\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub0b4\ubd80 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \uc190\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uc11c\uba85\uc744 \uc704\uc870\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc591\uc790 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, PQC \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \uace0\uc804 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ub300\uccb4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ucc44\ud0dd\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 SLH-DSA\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548\uc744 \uc704\ud611\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacf5\uaca9 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "Rowhammer\ub85c \uc720\ub3c4\ub41c \ube44\ud2b8 \ud50c\ub9bd\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec SLH-DSA\uc758 \ub0b4\ubd80 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \uc190\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uc11c\uba85\uc744 \uc704\uc870\ud558\ub294 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uc804\uc6a9 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \uad6c\ud604\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacf5\uaca9 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Swage\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec Rowhammer \uae30\ubc18 \uc624\ub958 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "OpenSSL 3.5.1\uc5d0\uc11c SLH-DSA\uc758 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc218\uc900\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc644\uc804\ud55c \uc885\ub8cc \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud588\uc73c\uba70, \ucd5c\uace0 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc218\uc900\uc5d0\uc11c 8\uc2dc\uac04\uc758 \ud574\uba38\ub9c1\uacfc 36\ucd08\uc758 \ud6c4\ucc98\ub9ac\ub85c \ubcf4\ud3b8\uc801 \uc704\uc870\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc548\uc804\ud55c PQC \ubc29\uc2dd\uc870\ucc28\ub3c4 \uc2e4\uc81c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\ud328\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70, Rowhammer\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucd94\uac00\uc801\uc778 \uad6c\ud604 \uac15\ud654\ub098 \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \ubc29\uc5b4\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc591\uc790 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305\uc774 \ubc1c\uc804\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c PQC \uccb4\uacc4\uac00 \uace0\uc804 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ub300\uccb4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ucc44\ud0dd\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8 \uc911 SLH-DSA\ub294 \ucd5c\uadfc NIST\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ud45c\uc900\ud654\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70 \ubcf4\uc548 \uae30\ubc18\uc774 \ubcf4\uc218\uc801\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \uc120\ud638\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 Rowhammer\ub85c \uc720\ub3c4\ub41c \ube44\ud2b8 \ud50c\ub9bd\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub0b4\ubd80 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \uc190\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uc11c\uba85\uc744 \uc704\uc870\ud558\ub294 SLH-DSA\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uc804\uc6a9 \ubcf4\ud3b8\uc801 \uc704\uc870 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uc804 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub0b4\uc7a5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uc5ec \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc811\uadfc\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud588\uc73c\ub098, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacf5\uaca9\uc740 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uc804\uc6a9\uc774\uba70 \uc0c1\uc6a9 \ub370\uc2a4\ud06c\ud0d1\uacfc \uc11c\ubc84 \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4\ub97c \uaca8\ub0e5\ud558\uc5ec \uc704\ud611 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud655\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Financial markets are inherently\ncomplex, marked by high volatility and intricate patterns that traditional\nmodels often fail to capture. QGANs, leveraging the power of quantum computing,\noffer a novel approach by combining the strengths of generative models with\nquantum machine learning techniques. We implement a QGAN model tailored for\nstock price prediction and evaluate its performance using historical stock\nmarket data. Our results demonstrate that QGANs can generate synthetic data\nclosely resembling actual market behavior, leading to enhanced prediction\naccuracy. The experiment was conducted using the Stocks index price data and\nthe AWS Braket SV1 simulator for training the QGAN circuits. The\nquantum-enhanced model outperforms classical Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and\nGAN models in terms of convergence speed and prediction accuracy. This research\nrepresents a key step toward integrating quantum computing in financial\nforecasting, offering potential advantages in speed and precision over\ntraditional methods. The findings suggest important implications for traders,\nfinancial analysts, and researchers seeking advanced tools for market analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc8fc\uac00 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc591\uc790 \uc0dd\uc131\uc801 \uc801\ub300 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(QGAN)\uc758 \uc801\uc6a9\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae08\uc735 \uc2dc\uc7a5\uc740 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud558\uba70 \ub192\uc740 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uacfc \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc885\uc885 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc591\uc790 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305\uc758 \ud798\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc0dd\uc131\uc801 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uc591\uc790 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\uc220\uc758 \uac15\uc810\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c QGAN \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uad6c\ud604\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "QGAN\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc2dc\uc7a5 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubc00\uc811\ud558\uac8c \ub2ee\uc740 \ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uae08\uc735 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0 \uc591\uc790 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub2e8\uacc4\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\uba70, \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc18d\ub3c4\uc640 \uc815\ubc00\ub3c4\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \uc774\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc8fc\uac00 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc591\uc790 \uc0dd\uc131\uc801 \uc801\ub300 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(QGAN)\uc758 \uc801\uc6a9\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4. \uae08\uc735 \uc2dc\uc7a5\uc740 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud558\uba70, \ub192\uc740 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uacfc \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc885\uc885 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud328\ud134\uc774 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc774\ub2e4.

Match Chat integrates Generative Artificial Intelligence\n(GenAI) with Generative Computing (GenComp) techniques to synthesize key\ninsights during live tennis singles matches. The system debuted at the 2025\nWimbledon Championships and the 2025 US Open, where it provided about 1 million\nusers with seamless access to streaming and static data through natural\nlanguage queries. The architecture is grounded in an Agent-Oriented\nArchitecture (AOA) combining rule engines, predictive models, and agents to\npre-process and optimize user queries before passing them to GenAI components.\nThe Match Chat system had an answer accuracy of 92.83% with an average response\ntime of 6.25 seconds under loads of up to 120 requests per second (RPS). Over\n96.08% of all queries were guided using interactive prompt design, contributing\nto a user experience that prioritized clarity, responsiveness, and minimal\neffort. The system was designed to mask architectural complexity, offering a\nfrictionless and intuitive interface that required no onboarding or technical\nfamiliarity. Across both Grand Slam deployments, Match Chat maintained 100%\nuptime and supported nearly 1 million unique users, underscoring the\nscalability and reliability of the platform.

Despite\ntheir promising capabilities, the standard implementation of DeepONets, which\ntypically employs fully connected linear layers in the trunk network, can\nencounter limitations in capturing complex spatial structures inherent to\nvarious PDEs. To address this, we introduce Fourier-embedded trunk networks\nwithin the DeepONet architecture, leveraging random Fourier feature mappings to\nenrich spatial representation capabilities. Our proposed Fourier-embedded\nDeepONet, FEDONet demonstrates superior performance compared to the traditional\nDeepONet across a comprehensive suite of PDE-driven datasets, including the\ntwo-dimensional Poisson equation, Burgers' equation, the Lorenz-63 chaotic\nsystem, Eikonal equation, Allen-Cahn equation, Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation,\nand the Lorenz-96 system. Empirical evaluations of FEDONet consistently show\nsignificant improvements in solution reconstruction accuracy, with average\nrelative L2 performance gains ranging between 2-3x compared to the DeepONet\nbaseline.

This\nwork proposes a federated learning framework for smart farming, aiming to\ndevelop a scalable, efficient, and secure solution for crop disease detection\ntailored to the environmental and operational conditions of Minnesota farms. By\nmaintaining sensitive farm data locally and enabling collaborative model\nupdates, our proposed framework seeks to achieve high accuracy in crop disease\nclassification without compromising data privacy. We outline a methodology\ninvolving data collection from Minnesota farms, application of local deep\nlearning algorithms, transfer learning, and a central aggregation server for\nmodel refinement, aiming to achieve improved accuracy in disease detection,\ngood generalization across agricultural scenarios, lower costs in communication\nand training time, and earlier identification and intervention against diseases\nin future implementations. We outline a methodology and anticipated outcomes,\nsetting the stage for empirical validation in subsequent studies. This work\ncomes in a context where more and more demand for data-driven interpretations\nin agriculture has to be weighed with concerns about privacy from farms that\nare hesitant to share their operational data. This will be important to provide\na secure and efficient disease detection method that can finally revolutionize\nsmart farming systems and solve local agricultural problems with data\nconfidentiality. In doing so, this paper bridges the gap between advanced\nmachine learning techniques and the practical, privacy-sensitive needs of\nfarmers in Minnesota and beyond, leveraging the benefits of federated learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub18d\uc5c5 \ubd80\ubb38\uc758 \ubcc0\ud654\uc640 \ud568\uaed8 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \ub18d\uc7a5 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c

However, existing approaches often treat prior experiences and\nknowledge as monolithic units, leading to inefficient and coarse-grained\nknowledge transfer. In this work, we propose a novel hierarchical memory\narchitecture that enables fine-grained knowledge transfer by decoupling\nhigh-level planning memory from low-level execution memory. To construct and\nrefine these hierarchical memories, we introduce Hierarchical Hindsight\nReflection (H$^2$R), a mechanism that distills reusable and hierarchical\nknowledge from past agent-environment interactions.

Graph-Based Architectures", "comment": null, "summary": "We propose a novel neural network architecture, called Non-Trainable\nModification (NTM), for computing Nash equilibria in stochastic differential\ngames (SDGs) on graphs. These games model a broad class of graph-structured\nmulti-agent systems arising in finance, robotics, energy, and social dynamics,\nwhere agents interact locally under uncertainty. The NTM architecture imposes a\ngraph-guided sparsification on feedforward neural networks, embedding fixed,\nnon-trainable components aligned with the underlying graph topology. This\ndesign enhances interpretability and stability, while significantly reducing\nthe number of trainable parameters in large-scale, sparse settings. We\ntheoretically establish a universal approximation property for NTM in static\ngames on graphs and numerically validate its expressivity and robustness\nthrough supervised learning tasks. Building on this foundation, we incorporate\nNTM into two state-of-the-art game solvers, Direct Parameterization and Deep\nBSDE, yielding their sparse variants (NTM-DP and NTM-DBSDE).

The Planning Copilot leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a\nrecently developed standard for connecting LLMs with external tools and\nsystems. This approach allows using any LLM that supports MCP without\ndomain-specific fine-tuning. Our Planning Copilot supports common planning\ntasks such as checking the syntax of planning problems, selecting an\nappropriate planner, calling it, validating the plan it generates, and\nsimulating their execution. We empirically evaluate the ability of our Planning\nCopilot to perform these tasks using three open-source LLMs. The results show\nthat the Planning Copilot highly outperforms using the same LLMs without the\nplanning tools. We also conducted a limited qualitative comparison of our tool\nagainst Chat GPT-5, a very recent commercial LLM. Our results shows that our\nPlanning Copilot significantly outperforms GPT-5 despite relying on a much\nsmaller LLM.

With the rise of foundation models, an open question is how they\ncompare to traditional methods for brain signal forecasting and causality\nanalysis, and whether they can be applied in a zero-shot setting. In this work,\nwe evaluate a foundation model against classical methods for inferring\ndirectional interactions from spontaneous brain activity measured with\nfunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans. Traditional approaches\noften rely on Wiener-Granger causality. We tested the forecasting ability of\nthe foundation model in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings, and assessed\ncausality by comparing Granger-like estimates from the model with standard\nGranger causality. We validated the approach using synthetic time series\ngenerated from ground-truth causal models, including logistic map coupling and\nOrnstein-Uhlenbeck processes. The foundation model achieved competitive\nzero-shot forecasting fMRI time series (mean absolute percentage error of 0.55\nin controls and 0.27 in patients). Although standard Granger causality did not\nshow clear quantitative differences between models, the foundation model\nprovided a more precise detection of causal interactions.\n  Overall, these findings suggest that foundation models offer versatility,\nstrong zero-shot performance, and potential utility for forecasting and causal\ndiscovery in time-series data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8

However, in real-world scenarios\nwhere commercial models are not publicly accessible and computational resources\nare limited, existing TDA methods are often constrained by their reliance on\nfull model access and high computational costs. This poses significant\nchallenges to the broader adoption of TDA in practical applications.\n  In this work, we present a systematic study of TDA methods under various\naccess and resource constraints. We investigate the feasibility of performing\nTDA under varying levels of access constraints by leveraging appropriately\ndesigned solutions such as proxy models.

Current memory architectures often suffer from limited\nadaptability, insufficient multimodal integration, and an inability to support\ncontinuous learning.

Since synthetic data is sent to the server,\nleveraging the popular concept of dataset distillation, this FL framework\nprotects real data privacy while alleviating data heterogeneity. However, such\nmethods are still challenged by the redundant information and noise in entire\nspatial-domain designs, which inevitably increases the communication burden. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel Frequency-Domain aware FL method with\nhigh-energy concentration (FedFD) to address this problem. Our FedFD is\ninspired by the discovery that the discrete cosine transform predominantly\ndistributes energy to specific regions, referred to as high-energy\nconcentration. The principle behind FedFD is that low-energy like\nhigh-frequency components usually contain redundant information and noise, thus\nfiltering them helps reduce communication costs and optimize performance. Our\nFedFD is mathematically formulated to preserve the low-frequency components\nusing a binary mask, facilitating an optimal solution through frequency-domain\ndistribution alignment. In particular, real data-driven synthetic\nclassification is imposed into the loss to enhance the quality of the\nlow-frequency components. On five image and speech datasets, FedFD achieves\nsuperior performance than state-of-the-art methods while reducing communication\ncosts. For example, on the CIFAR-10 dataset with Dirichlet coefficient $\\alpha\n= 0.01$, FedFD achieves a minimum reduction of 37.78\\% in the communication\ncost, while attaining a 10.88\\% performance gain.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uacf5\uc720 \uc5c6\uc774 \ud611\uc5c5 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 FedFD\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uace0 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ube44\uacf5\uc720 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc\ub97c \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\uace0 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "FedFD\ub294 \uc774\uc0b0 \ucf54\uc0ac\uc778 \ubcc0\ud658\uc758 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0\ub97c \ud2b9\uc815 \uc601\uc5ed\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ud3ec\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \uc800\uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uace0\uc8fc\ud30c \uc131\ubd84\uc744 \ud544\ud130\ub9c1\ud558\uc5ec \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uace0 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub2e4\uc12f \uac1c\uc758 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ubc0f \uc74c\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c FedFD\ub294 \ucd5c\uc2e0 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uc904\uc600\ub2e4. \uc608\ub97c \ub4e4\uc5b4, CIFAR-10 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 37.78%\uc758 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ube44\uc6a9 \uc808\uac10\uacfc 10.88%\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uae30\ub85d\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "FedFD\ub294 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uc904\uc774\ub294 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uc131\ub2a5 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ud601\uc2e0\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5(FL)\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uacf5\uc720 \uc5c6\uc774 \ud611\ub825 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \uc11c\ubc84\ub85c \uc804\uc1a1\ub418\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc9d1\ud569 \uc99d\ub958\uc758 \uc778\uae30 \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 FL \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc\ub97c \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc804\uccb4 \uacf5\uac04 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc124\uacc4\uc758 \uc911\ubcf5 \uc815\ubcf4\uc640 \ub178\uc774\uc988\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ub3c4\uc804\ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ud544\uc5f0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ubd80\ub2f4\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uace0\uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \ub18d\ucd95\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc8fc\ud30c\uc218 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc778\uc2dd FL \ubc29\ubc95(FedFD)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 FedFD\ub294 \uc774\uc0b0 \ucf54\uc0ac\uc778 \ubcc0\ud658\uc774 \uc8fc\ub85c \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0\ub97c \ud2b9\uc815 \uc601\uc5ed\uc5d0 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4\ub294 \ubc1c\uacac\uc5d0\uc11c \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc558\ub2e4.

Shapes are\nremembered constellations of sensory, linguistic, conceptual, episodic, and\nprocedural knowledge that allow agents to cut through the complexity of real\nlife the same way as people do: by expecting things to be typical, recognizing\npatterns, acting by habit, reasoning by analogy, satisficing, and generally\nminimizing cognitive load to the degree situations permit. Atypical outcomes\nare treated using shapes-based recovery methods, such as learning on the fly,\nasking a human partner for help, or seeking an actionable, even if imperfect,\nsituational understanding. Although shapes is an umbrella term, it is not\nvague: shapes-based modeling involves particular objectives, hypotheses,\nmodeling strategies, knowledge bases, and actual models of wide-ranging\nphenomena, all implemented within a particular cognitive architecture.

Recently, time series foundation models\n(TSFMs) have emerged as a powerful tool for anomaly detection. However,\nexisting methods typically rely on the final layer's representations of TSFMs,\ncomputing the anomaly score as a reconstruction or forecasting error via a\ntask-specific head. Instead, we propose TimeRep, a novel anomaly detection\napproach that leverages the intermediate layer's representations of TSFMs,\ncomputing the anomaly score as the distance between these representations.\nGiven a pre-trained TSFM, TimeRep selects the intermediate layer and\npatch-token position that yield the most informative representation. TimeRep\nforms a reference collection of intermediate representations from the training\ndata and applies a core-set strategy to reduce its size while maintaining\ndistributional coverage. During inference, TimeRep computes the anomaly score\nfor incoming data by measuring the distance between its intermediate\nrepresentations and those of the collection. To address concept drift, TimeRep\nintegrates an adaptation mechanism that, at inference time, augments the\ncollection exclusively with non-redundant intermediate representations from\nincoming data.

We propose ZTree, a novel decision tree learning framework that\nreplaces CART's traditional purity based splitting with statistically\nprincipled subgroup identification. At each node, ZTree applies hypothesis\ntesting (e.g., z-tests, t-tests, Mann-Whitney U, log-rank) to assess whether a\ncandidate subgroup differs meaningfully from the complement. To adjust for the\ncomplication of multiple testing, we employ a cross-validation-based approach\nto determine if further node splitting is needed. This robust stopping\ncriterion eliminates the need for post-pruning and makes the test threshold\n(z-threshold) the only parameter for controlling tree complexity. Because of\nthe simplicity of the tree growing procedure, once a detailed tree is learned\nusing the most lenient z-threshold, all simpler trees can be derived by simply\nremoving nodes that do not meet the larger z-thresholds. This makes parameter\ntuning intuitive and efficient. Furthermore, this z-threshold is essentially a\np-value, allowing users to easily plug in appropriate statistical tests into\nour framework without adjusting the range of parameter search. Empirical\nevaluation on five large-scale UCI datasets demonstrates that ZTree\nconsistently delivers strong performance, especially at low data regimes.\nCompared to CART, ZTree also tends to grow simpler trees without sacrificing\nperformance.

To address this, we propose Tool-R1, a reinforcement\nlearning framework that enables LLMs to perform general, compositional, and\nmulti-step tool use by generating executable Python code. Tool-R1 supports\nintegration of user-defined tools and standard libraries, with variable sharing\nacross steps to construct coherent workflows. An outcome-based reward function,\ncombining LLM-based answer judgment and code execution success, guides policy\noptimization. To improve training efficiency, we maintain a dynamic sample\nqueue to cache and reuse high-quality trajectories, reducing the overhead of\ncostly online sampling. Experiments on the GAIA benchmark show that Tool-R1\nsubstantially improves both accuracy and robustness, achieving about 10\\% gain\nover strong baselines, with larger improvements on complex multi-step tasks.\nThese results highlight the potential of Tool-R1 for enabling reliable and\nefficient tool-augmented reasoning in real-world applications.

We represent\ndynamic systems as spatiotemporal multiplex graphs and model their latent\ntrajectories using a GNN-parameterized vector field. Given the sparse context\nobservations at node and edge levels, the model infers a distribution over\nlatent initial states and control variables, enabling both interpolation and\nextrapolation of trajectories. We validate the method on three synthetic\ndynamical systems (coupled pendulum, Lorenz attractor, and Kuramoto\noscillators) and two real-world cardiac imaging datasets - ACDC (N=150) and UK\nBiobank (N=526) - demonstrating accurate reconstruction, extrapolation, and\ndisease classification capabilities. The model accurately reconstructs\ntrajectories and extrapolates future cardiac cycles from a single observed\ncycle. It achieves state-of-the-art results on the ACDC classification task (up\nto 99% accuracy), and detects atrial fibrillation in UK Biobank subjects with\ncompetitive performance (up to 67% accuracy).

A key challenge in training SNNs is to\nsolve both spatial and temporal credit assignment. The dominant approach for\ntraining SNNs is Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) with surrogate gradients.\nHowever, BPTT is in stark contrast with the spatial and temporal locality\nobserved in biological neural systems and leads to high computational and\nmemory demands, limiting efficient training strategies and on-device learning.\nAlthough existing local learning rules achieve local temporal credit assignment\nby leveraging eligibility traces, they fail to address the spatial credit\nassignment without resorting to auxiliary layer-wise matrices, which increase\nmemory overhead and hinder scalability, especially on embedded devices. In this\nwork, we propose Traces Propagation (TP), a forward-only, memory-efficient,\nscalable, and fully local learning rule that combines eligibility traces with a\nlayer-wise contrastive loss without requiring auxiliary layer-wise matrices. TP\noutperforms other fully local learning rules on NMNIST and SHD datasets. On\nmore complex datasets such as DVS-GESTURE and DVS-CIFAR10, TP showcases\ncompetitive performance and scales effectively to deeper SNN architectures such\nas VGG-9, while providing favorable memory scaling compared to prior fully\nlocal scalable rules, for datasets with a significant number of classes.\nFinally, we show that TP is well suited for practical fine-tuning tasks, such\nas keyword spotting on the Google Speech Commands dataset, thus paving the way\nfor efficient learning at the edge.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uba70 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c Spiking Neural Networks(SNN) \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uc704\ud55c Traces Propagation(TP) \ud559\uc2b5 \uaddc\uce59\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "SNN\uc740 \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801 \uc2e0\uacbd \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc6d0\ub9ac\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\ub294 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud6c8\ub828 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uacf5\uac04 \ubc0f \uc2dc\uac04 \ud06c\ub808\ub527 \ud560\ub2f9\uc774 \uc8fc\uc694 \uacfc\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "TP\ub294 \uc790\uaca9 \ucd94\uc801\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uacf5\uac04 \ud06c\ub808\ub527 \ud560\ub2f9\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0, \ubcf4\uc870 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4-\uc640\uc774\uc988 \ub9e4\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc2a4\ub97c \uc694\uad6c\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba74\uc11c \ub808\uc774\uc5b4-\uc640\uc774\uc988 \ub300\uc870 \uc190\uc2e4\uacfc \uacb0\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "TP\ub294 NMNIST \ubc0f SHD \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\ub978 \uc644\uc804\ud788 \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc801\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5 \uaddc\uce59\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, DVS-GESTURE \ubc0f DVS-CIFAR10\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "TP\ub294 Google Speech Commands \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \ud0a4\uc6cc\ub4dc \uc2a4\ud3ec\ud305\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uc801\ud569\ud558\uba70, \uc5e3\uc9c0\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uae38\uc744 \uc5f4\uc5b4\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc2a4\ud30c\uc774\ud0b9 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(SNN)\uc740 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc2dc\uacf5\uac04 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uace0 \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801 \uc2e0\uacbd \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc6d0\ub9ac\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

The primary\nissue is that new knowledge can interfere with previously learned information,\ncausing the model to forget earlier knowledge in favor of the new, a phenomenon\nknown as catastrophic forgetting. Although large pre-trained models can\npartially mitigate forgetting by leveraging their existing knowledge and\nover-parameterization, they often struggle when confronted with novel data\ndistributions. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA,\nenable efficient adaptation to new knowledge. However, they still face\nchallenges in scaling to dynamic learning scenarios and long sequences of\ntasks, as maintaining one adapter per task introduces complexity and increases\nthe potential for interference. In this paper, we introduce Hierarchical\nAdapters Merging (HAM), a novel framework that dynamically combines adapters\nfrom different tasks during training. This approach enables HAM to scale\neffectively, allowing it to manage more tasks than competing baselines with\nimproved efficiency. To achieve this, HAM maintains a fixed set of groups that\nhierarchically consolidate new adapters. For each task, HAM trains a low-rank\nadapter along with an importance scalar, then dynamically groups tasks based on\nadapter similarity.

During the process, they often re-derive the same\nintermediate steps across problems, inflating token usage and latency. This\nsaturation of the context window leaves less capacity for exploration. We study\na simple mechanism that converts recurring reasoning fragments into concise,\nreusable \"behaviors\" (name + instruction) via the model's own metacognitive\nanalysis of prior traces. These behaviors are stored in a \"behavior handbook\"\nwhich supplies them to the model in-context at inference or distills them into\nparameters via supervised fine-tuning. This approach achieves improved\ntest-time reasoning across three different settings - 1) Behavior-conditioned\ninference: Providing the LLM relevant behaviors in-context during reasoning\nreduces number of reasoning tokens by up to 46% while matching or improving\nbaseline accuracy; 2) Behavior-guided self-improvement: Without any parameter\nupdates, the model improves its own future reasoning by leveraging behaviors\nfrom its own past problem solving attempts. This yields up to 10% higher\naccuracy than a naive critique-and-revise baseline; and 3) Behavior-conditioned\nSFT: SFT on behavior-conditioned reasoning traces is more effective at\nconverting non-reasoning models into reasoning models as compared to vanilla\nSFT.

The success of such attacks\nheavily relies on their stealthiness, the ability to blend in with the original\ngraph and evade detection. However, existing methods often achieve stealthiness\nby relying on indirect proxy metrics, lacking consideration for the fundamental\ncharacteristics of the injected content, or focusing only on imitating local\nstructures, which leads to the problem of local myopia. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose a dual-constraint stealthy node injection framework,\ncalled Joint Alignment of Nodal and Universal Structures (JANUS). At the local\nlevel, we introduce a local feature manifold alignment strategy to achieve\ngeometric consistency in the feature space. At the global level, we incorporate\nstructured latent variables and maximize the mutual information with the\ngenerated structures, ensuring the injected structures are consistent with the\nsemantic patterns of the original graph. We model the injection attack as a\nsequential decision process, which is optimized by a reinforcement learning\nagent.

With this integrated pipeline, WebSailor significantly\noutperforms all open-source agents in complex information-seeking tasks,\nmatching proprietary agents' performance and closing the capability gap.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc778\uc9c0 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\ub294 LLM \ud6c8\ub828\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8e8\uace0, WebSailor\ub77c\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc815\ubcf4 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uc5ed\ub7c9\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc778\uc9c0 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 LLM \ud6c8\ub828\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uacbd\uacc4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "WebSailor\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uacfc \uc815\ubcf4 \ud63c\ub3d9, RFT \ucf5c\ub4dc \uc2a4\ud0c0\ud2b8, Duplicating Sampling Policy Optimization(DUPO)\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uace0\ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc5ed\ub7c9\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc644\uc804\ud55c \ud3ec\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "WebSailor\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc624\ud508 \uc18c\uc2a4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud604\uc800\ud788 \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\uba70, \ub3c5\uc810 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \uc77c\uce58\ud558\uace0 \ub2a5\ub825 \uac04\uc758 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \uc904\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "WebSailor\ub294 \uc815\ubcf4 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uae30\uc220\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uc18c\ud558\ub294 \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc778 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc778\uc9c0 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 LLM \ud6c8\ub828\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uacbd\uacc4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.
