A single\nvehicle's limited sensor range and obstructed views increase the likelihood of\naccidents. Multi-vehicle connected systems and multi-modal approaches,\nleveraging RGB images and LiDAR point clouds, have emerged as promising\nsolutions. However, existing methods often assume the availability of all data\nmodalities and connected vehicles during both training and testing, which is\nimpractical due to potential sensor failures or missing connected vehicles. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce a novel framework MMCD (Multi-Modal\nCollaborative Decision-making) for connected autonomy. Our framework fuses\nmulti-modal observations from ego and collaborative vehicles to enhance\ndecision-making under challenging conditions. To ensure robust performance when\ncertain data modalities are unavailable during testing, we propose an approach\nbased on cross-modal knowledge distillation with a teacher-student model\nstructure. The teacher model is trained with multiple data modalities, while\nthe student model is designed to operate effectively with reduced modalities.\nIn experiments on $\\textit{connected autonomous driving with ground vehicles}$\nand $\\textit{aerial-ground vehicles collaboration}$, our method improves\ndriving safety by up to ${\\it 20.7}\\%$, surpassing the best-existing baseline\nin detecting potential accidents and making safe driving decisions.

To address these challenges, we introduce Foam-Agent, a\nmulti-agent framework that automates the entire end-to-end OpenFOAM workflow\nfrom a single natural language prompt. Our key innovations address critical\ngaps in existing systems: 1. An Comprehensive End-to-End Simulation Automation:\nFoam-Agent is the first system to manage the full simulation pipeline,\nincluding advanced pre-processing with a versatile Meshing Agent capable of\nhandling external mesh files and generating new geometries via Gmsh, automatic\ngeneration of HPC submission scripts, and post-simulation visualization via\nParaView. 2. Composable Service Architecture: Going beyond a monolithic agent,\nthe framework uses Model Context Protocol (MCP) to expose its core functions as\ndiscrete, callable tools. This allows for flexible integration and use by other\nagentic systems, such as Claude-code, for more exploratory workflows. 3.\nHigh-Fidelity Configuration Generation: We achieve superior accuracy through a\nHierarchical Multi-Index RAG for precise context retrieval and a\ndependency-aware generation process that ensures configuration consistency.\nEvaluated on a benchmark of 110 simulation tasks, Foam-Agent achieves an 88.2%\nsuccess rate with Claude 3.5 Sonnet, significantly outperforming existing\nframeworks (55.5% for MetaOpenFOAM). Foam-Agent dramatically lowers the\nexpertise barrier for CFD, demonstrating how specialized multi-agent systems\ncan democratize complex scientific computing.

Most of these rely on static analysis, using statistical code\nrepresentations or Machine Learning (ML) classifiers to distinguish insecure\nconfigurations from safe code.\n  In this work, we introduce a novel approach that enhances static analysis\nwith semantic understanding by jointly leveraging natural language and code\nrepresentations. Our method builds on two complementary ML models: CodeBERT, to\ncapture semantics across code and text, and LongFormer, to represent long IaC\nscripts without losing contextual information. We evaluate our approach on\nmisconfiguration datasets from two widely used IaC tools, Ansible and Puppet.\nTo validate its effectiveness, we conduct two ablation studies (removing code\ntext from the natural language input and truncating scripts to reduce context)\nand compare against four large language models (LLMs) and prior work.

However, recent studies indicate that private training data can still\nbe exposed through gradient inversion attacks. While earlier analytical methods\nhave demonstrated success in reconstructing input data from fully connected\nlayers, their effectiveness significantly diminishes when applied to\nconvolutional layers, high-dimensional inputs, and scenarios involving multiple\ntraining examples. This paper extends our previous work \\cite{eltaras2024r} and\nproposes three advanced algorithms to broaden the applicability of gradient\ninversion attacks. The first algorithm presents a novel data leakage method\nthat efficiently exploits convolutional layer gradients, demonstrating that\neven with non-fully invertible activation functions, such as ReLU, training\nsamples can be analytically reconstructed directly from gradients without the\nneed to reconstruct intermediate layer outputs. Building on this foundation,\nthe second algorithm extends this analytical approach to support\nhigh-dimensional input data, substantially enhancing its utility across complex\nreal-world datasets. The third algorithm introduces an innovative analytical\nmethod for reconstructing mini-batches, addressing a critical gap in current\nresearch that predominantly focuses on reconstructing only a single training\nexample. Unlike previous studies that focused mainly on the weight constraints\nof convolutional layers, our approach emphasizes the pivotal role of gradient\nconstraints, revealing that successful attacks can be executed with fewer than\n5\\% of the constraints previously deemed necessary in certain layers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \uc6d0\uc2dc \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c

Agency first launches N instantiations of Agent Solve to\nyield N independent Proposed Problem Solution Realizations; Agency then invokes\nAgent Compare to summarize and compare the N Proposed Problem Solution\nRealizations and to provide a Recommended Problem Solution. We argue from\nCondorcet's Jury Theorem that, for a Problem Statement characterized by\nper-Solve success probability greater than 1/2 (and N sufficiently large), the\nPredominant (Agent Compare) Proposed Problem Solution will, with high\nprobability, correspond to a Correct Proposed Problem Solution. Furthermore,\nAgent Compare can also incorporate aspects of Secondary (Agent Compare)\nProposed Problem Solutions, in particular when the latter represent alternative\nProblem Statement interpretations - different Mathematical Models - or\nalternative Mathematical Solution Procedures.

To understand this phenomenon, we investigate LLMs through the lens of\nclassic code metrics. Surprisingly, we find that a classifier trained solely on\nthese metrics performs on par with state-of-the-art LLMs for vulnerability\ndiscovery. A root-cause analysis reveals a strong correlation and a causal\neffect between LLMs and code metrics: When the value of a metric is changed,\nLLM predictions tend to shift by a corresponding magnitude. This dependency\nsuggests that LLMs operate at a similarly shallow level as code metrics,\nlimiting their ability to grasp complex patterns and fully realize their\npotential in vulnerability discovery. Based on these findings, we derive\nrecommendations on how research should more effectively address this challenge.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc740 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uacf5\ud559\uc5d0\uc11c \ub9ce\uc740 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc798 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ucd5c\uadfc \uba87 \ub144 \ub3d9\uc548 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131 \ubc1c\uacac\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud65c\uc6a9\uc774 \uc815\uccb4\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ucf54\ub4dc \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 LLM\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uace0, \uadf8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub85c LLM\uc774 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ud30c\uc545\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc784\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc5f0\uad6c\uac00 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad8c\uc7a5 \uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \ucde8\uc57d\uc131 \ubc1c\uacac\uc758 \uc815\uccb4 \ud604\uc0c1 \uc774\ud574", "method": "\uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ucf54\ub4dc \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c LLM \ubd84\uc11d \ubc0f \ube44\uad50", "result": "\uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \ubd84\ub958\uae30\uac00 \ucd5c\uc2e0 LLM\uacfc \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc784\uacfc \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 LLM\uacfc \ucf54\ub4dc \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad \uac04\uc758 \uac15\ud55c \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4 \ubc0f \uc778\uacfc \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ubc1c\uacac", "conclusion": "LLM\uc774 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ud30c\uc545\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc774\uba70, \uc774\ud6c4 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad8c\uc7a5 \uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc740 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uacf5\ud559\uc758 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ucde8\uc57d\uc131 \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud65c\uc6a9\uc740 \ucd5c\uadfc \uba87 \ub144 \ub3d9\uc548 \uc815\uccb4\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 LLM\uc744 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ucf54\ub4dc \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc758 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub180\ub78d\uac8c\ub3c4, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ubd84\ub958\uae30\uac00 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131 \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ucd5c\uc2e0 LLM\uacfc \ub3d9\ub4f1\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadfc\ubcf8 \uc6d0\uc778 \ubd84\uc11d \uacb0\uacfc, LLM\uacfc \ucf54\ub4dc \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad \uac04\uc5d0 \uac15\ud55c \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4\uc640 \uc778\uacfc \uad00\uacc4\uac00 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc758 \uac12\uc774 \ubcc0\ud654\ud560 \ub54c, LLM \uc608\uce21 \ub610\ud55c \uc774\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ubcc0\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc740 LLM\uc774 \ucf54\ub4dc \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uacfc \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uc595\uc740 \uc218\uc900\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uadf8\ub4e4\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud328\ud134\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131 \ubc1c\uacac\uc5d0\uc11c \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \ubc1c\ud718\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5f0\uad6c\uac00 \uc774 \ub3c4\uc804\uc5d0 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub300\uc751\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad8c\uc7a5 \uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

We\nintroduce a lightweight hierarchical reinforcement learning framework,\nComputerAgent, that formulates OS control as a two-level option process\n(manager and subpolicy), employs a triple-modal state encoder (screenshot, task\nID, numeric state) to handle visual and contextual diversity, integrates\nmeta-actions with an early-stop mechanism to reduce wasted interactions, and\nuses a compact vision backbone plus small policy networks for on-device\ninference (15M parameters). On a suite of 135 real-world desktop tasks,\nComputerAgent attains 92.1% success on simple tasks (<8 steps) and 58.8% on\nhard tasks (>=8 steps), matching or exceeding 200B-parameter MLLM baselines on\nsimple scenarios while reducing model size by over four orders of magnitude and\nhalving inference time.

Unlike a typical software application residing in a Demilitarized Zone\n(DMZ), agentic LLMs consciously rely on nondeterministic behavior of the AI\n(only defining a final goal, leaving the path selection to LLM). This\ncharacteristic introduces substantial security risk to both operational\nsecurity and information security. Most common existing defense mechanism rely\non detection of malicious intent and preventing it from reaching the LLM agent,\nthus protecting against jailbreak attacks such as prompt injection. In this\npaper, we present an alternative approach, LLMZ+, which moves beyond\ntraditional detection-based approaches by implementing prompt whitelisting.\nThrough this method, only contextually appropriate and safe messages are\npermitted to interact with the agentic LLM. By leveraging the specificity of\ncontext, LLMZ+ guarantees that all exchanges between external users and the LLM\nconform to predefined use cases and operational boundaries. Our approach\nstreamlines the security framework, enhances its long-term resilience, and\nreduces the resources required for sustaining LLM information security. Our\nempirical evaluation demonstrates that LLMZ+ provides strong resilience against\nthe most common jailbreak prompts. At the same time, legitimate business\ncommunications are not disrupted, and authorized traffic flows seamlessly\nbetween users and the agentic LLM. We measure the effectiveness of approach\nusing false positive and false negative rates, both of which can be reduced to\n0 in our experimental setting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8

We present a\nnovel geospatial agent-based model that integrates climate hazard data with\nevolutionary learning for economic agents. Our framework combines Mesa-based\nspatial modelling with CLIMADA climate impact assessment, introducing adaptive\nlearning behaviours that allow firms to evolve strategies for budget\nallocation, pricing, wages, and risk adaptation through fitness-based selection\nand mutation. We demonstrate the framework using riverine flood projections\nunder RCP8.5 until 2100, showing that evolutionary adaptation enables firms to\nconverge with baseline (no hazard) production levels after decades of\ndisruption due to climate stress. Our results reveal systemic risks where even\nagents that are not directly exposed to floods face impacts through supply\nchain disruptions, with the end-of-century average price of goods 5.6% higher\nunder RCP8.5 compared to the baseline.

However, data is often not structured in ways\nthat are optimal for AI utilization. Moreover, an important question arises:\nhow much knowledge can we pack into data through intensive data operations?\nAutonomous data agents (DataAgents), which integrate LLM reasoning with task\ndecomposition, action reasoning and grounding, and tool calling, can\nautonomously interpret data task descriptions, decompose tasks into subtasks,\nreason over actions, ground actions into python code or tool calling, and\nexecute operations. Unlike traditional data management and engineering tools,\nDataAgents dynamically plan workflows, call powerful tools, and adapt to\ndiverse data tasks at scale. This report argues that DataAgents represent a\nparadigm shift toward autonomous data-to-knowledge systems. DataAgents are\ncapable of handling collection, integration, preprocessing, selection,\ntransformation, reweighing, augmentation, reprogramming, repairs, and\nretrieval. Through these capabilities, DataAgents transform complex and\nunstructured data into coherent and actionable knowledge. We first examine why\nthe convergence of agentic AI and data-to-knowledge systems has emerged as a\ncritical trend.

To bridge this gap, we propose\nProfileBench, an industrial benchmark derived from a real-world video platform,\nencompassing heterogeneous user data and a well-structured profiling taxonomy.\nHowever, the profiling task remains challenging due to the difficulty of\ncollecting large-scale ground-truth labels, and the heterogeneous and noisy\nuser information can compromise the reliability of LLMs. To approach label-free\nand reliable user profiling, we propose a Confidence-driven Profile reasoning\nframework Conf-Profile, featuring a two-stage paradigm. We first synthesize\nhigh-quality labels by leveraging advanced LLMs with confidence hints, followed\nby confidence-weighted voting for accuracy improvement and confidence\ncalibration for a balanced distribution. The multiple profile results,\nrationales, and confidence scores are aggregated and distilled into a\nlightweight LLM. We further enhance the reasoning ability via confidence-guided\nunsupervised reinforcement learning, which exploits confidence for difficulty\nfiltering, quasi-ground truth voting, and reward weighting. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that Conf-Profile delivers substantial performance through\nthe two-stage training, improving F1 by 13.97 on Qwen3-8B.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790

Its advanced capabilities\nare cultivated through a meticulously crafted training process, beginning with\nlong Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data cold-start and culminating in large-scale\nReinforcement Learning (RL). We first employ a well-designed cold-start\ntraining strategy, which significantly enhances the reasoning potential and\nequips the model with specialized skills in both formal and agentic reasoning.\nThen, a core innovation is our domain-parallel training scheme, which decouples\noptimization across distinct domains (e.g., STEM, Code, Agentic) and\nsubsequently fuses the resulting expert models into a single, nearly\nPareto-optimal model. This entire process is powered by our Dynamic\nORchestration for Asynchronous rollout (DORA) system, a large-scale RL\nframework that delivers a greater than threefold training speedup over\nsynchronous methods on tens of thousands of accelerators.

Despite recent progress in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), achieving\nhuman-level VSR remains highly challenging due to the complexity of\nrepresenting and reasoning over three-dimensional space. In this paper, we\npresent a systematic investigation of VSR in VLMs, encompassing a review of\nexisting methodologies across input modalities, model architectures, training\nstrategies, and reasoning mechanisms. Furthermore, we categorize spatial\nintelligence into three levels of capability, ie, basic perception, spatial\nunderstanding, spatial planning, and curate SIBench, a spatial intelligence\nbenchmark encompassing nearly 20 open-source datasets across 23 task settings.\nExperiments with state-of-the-art VLMs reveal a pronounced gap between\nperception and reasoning, as models show competence in basic perceptual tasks\nbut consistently underperform in understanding and planning tasks, particularly\nin numerical estimation, multi-view reasoning, temporal dynamics, and spatial\nimagination. These findings underscore the substantial challenges that remain\nin achieving spatial intelligence, while providing both a systematic roadmap\nand a comprehensive benchmark to drive future research in the field.

These agents are increasingly being\ndeployed across diverse real-world applications, including student education,\nscientific research, and financial analysis. However, despite their remarkable\npotential, LLM-based agents remain vulnerable to hallucination issues, which\ncan result in erroneous task execution and undermine the reliability of the\noverall system design. Addressing this critical challenge requires a deep\nunderstanding and a systematic consolidation of recent advances on LLM-based\nagents. To this end, we present the first comprehensive survey of\nhallucinations in LLM-based agents. By carefully analyzing the complete\nworkflow of agents, we propose a new taxonomy that identifies different types\nof agent hallucinations occurring at different stages.

However, the gap between their general knowledge and\nenvironment-specific requirements often leads to inaccurate plans. To address\nthis, existing approaches rely on frequent LLM queries to iteratively refine\nplans based on immediate environmental feedback, which incurs substantial query\ncosts. However, this refinement is typically guided by short-term environmental\nfeedback, limiting LLMs from developing plans aligned with long-term rewards.\nWe propose Code Driven Planning with Domain-Adaptive Critic (CoPiC). Instead of\nrelying on frequent queries, CoPiC employs LLMs to generate a diverse set of\nhigh-level planning programs, which iteratively produce and refine candidate\nplans. A trained domain-adaptive critic then evaluates these candidates and\nselects the one most aligned with long-term rewards for execution. Using\nhigh-level planning programs as planner and domain-adaptive critic as\nestimator, CoPiC improves planning while significantly reducing query costs.\nResults in ALFWorld, NetHack, and StarCraft II Unit Building show that CoPiC\noutperforms advanced LLM-based baselines, AdaPlanner and Reflexion, achieving\nan average (1) 23.33% improvement in success rate and (2) 91.27% reduction in\nquery costs.", "AI": {"tldr": "CoPiC\ub294 LLM\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uace0\uc218\uc900 \uacc4\ud68d \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uc7a5\uae30 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc5d0 \ub9de\ub294 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ucffc\ub9ac \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uc904\uc774\uba74\uc11c \uacc4\ud68d \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc989\uac01\uc801\uc778 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\uc815\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 LLM\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ube48\ubc88\ud55c \ucffc\ub9ac\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4dc\ub294 \ucffc\ub9ac \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "CoPiC\ub294 LLM\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uace0\uc218\uc900 \uacc4\ud68d \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uc774 \ud6c4\ubcf4 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131 \ubc0f \uc218\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc801\uc751 \ube44\ud3c9\uac00\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud6c4\ubcf4\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc7a5\uae30 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc5d0 \uac00\uc7a5 aligned\ub41c \uac83\uc744 \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "ALFWorld, NetHack, StarCraft II Unit Building\uc5d0\uc11c CoPiC\ub294 AdaPlanner \ubc0f Reflexion\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uace0\uae09 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uae30\uc900\uc120\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \ud3c9\uade0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c (1) 23.33%\uc758 \uc131\uacf5\ub960 \ud5a5\uc0c1 \ubc0f (2) 91.27%\uc758 \ucffc\ub9ac \ube44\uc6a9 \uc808\uac10\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "CoPiC\ub294 \uacc4\ud68d \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \ucffc\ub9ac \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \ud604\uc800\ud788 \uc904\uc774\ub294 \ud601\uc2e0\uc801\uc778 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc138\uacc4 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc21c\ucc28\uc801 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5 \uacc4\ud68d\uc790\ub85c \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub4e4\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uacfc \ud658\uacbd \ud2b9\uc815 \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d \uac04\uc758 \uac04\uadf9\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \ubd80\uc815\ud655\ud55c \uacc4\ud68d\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc9c4\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uc989\uac01\uc801\uc778 \ud658\uacbd \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\uc815\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ube48\ubc88\ud55c LLM \ucffc\ub9ac\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ucffc\ub9ac \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \ubc1c\uc0dd\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc218\uc815\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e8\uae30\uc801\uc778 \ud658\uacbd \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc548\ub0b4\ub418\ubbc0\ub85c LLM\uc774 \uc7a5\uae30 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc5d0 \ub9de\ub294 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc801\uc751 \ube44\ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \ucf54\ub4dc \uae30\ubc18 \uacc4\ud68d(CoPiC)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

However, existing MAS initialization methods do\nnot fully account for the collaborative needs of the generated agents in\nsubsequent stages. Inspired by the principles of effective team composition, we\npropose AgentInit, which aims to optimize the structure of agent teams.\nSpecifically, in addition to multi-round interactions and reflections between\nagents during agent generation, AgentInit incorporates a Natural Language to\nFormat mechanism to ensure consistency and standardization. Balanced team\nselection strategies using Pareto principles are subsequently applied to\njointly consider agent team diversity and task relevance to promote effective\nand efficient collaboration and enhance overall system performance. Experiments\nshow that AgentInit consistently outperforms state-of-the-art initialization\nmethods and pre-defined strategies across various frameworks and tasks,\nachieving an overall performance improvement of up to 1.2 and 1.6,\nrespectively, while also significantly reducing token consumption. Further\nanalysis confirms its strong transferability to similar tasks and verifies the\neffectiveness of its key components, demonstrating its capability and\nadaptability as a reliable MAS initialization method.

However,\ndeveloping effective mobile GUI agents with reinforcement learning (RL) remains\nchallenging due to the heavy-tailed distribution of task difficulty and the\ninefficiency of large-scale environment sampling. We present an online agentic\nreinforcement learning framework MOBILERL to enhance GUI agents in mobile\nenvironments. Its core component is the Difficulty-Adaptive GRPO (ADAGRPO)\nalgorithm. In ADAGRPO, we design difficulty-adaptive positive replay and\nfailure curriculum filtering to adapt the model to different task difficulties.\nWe introduce the shortest path reward adjustment strategy to reshape rewards\nconcerning the task length in multi-turn agentic tasks. Those strategies\njointly stabilize RL training, improve sample efficiency, and generate strong\nperformance across diverse mobile apps and tasks.

While prior work has primarily\naddressed statistical heterogeneity across organizations, a critical challenge\narises from economic competition, where organizations may act as market rivals,\nmaking them hesitant to participate in joint training due to potential utility\nloss (i.e., reduced net benefit). Furthermore, the combined effects of\nstatistical heterogeneity and inter-organizational competition on\norganizational behavior and system-wide social welfare remain underexplored. In\nthis paper, we propose CoCoGen, a coopetitive-compatible data generation\nframework, leveraging generative AI (GenAI) and potential game theory to model,\nanalyze, and optimize collaborative learning under heterogeneous and\ncompetitive settings. Specifically, CoCoGen characterizes competition and\nstatistical heterogeneity through learning performance and utility-based\nformulations and models each training round as a weighted potential game. We\nthen derive GenAI-based data generation strategies that maximize social\nwelfare.

To address this, knowledge transfer between similar\nstructures becomes essential. This study proposes a model-based transfer\nlearning approach using neural network surrogate models, enabling a model\ntrained on one bridge to be adapted to another with similar characteristics.\nThese models capture shared damage mechanisms, supporting a scalable and\ngeneralizable monitoring framework. The method was validated using real data\nfrom two bridges.

To address these limitations, we develop\nKM-GPT, the first fully automated, AI-powered pipeline for reconstructing IPD\ndirectly from KM plots with high accuracy, robustness, and reproducibility.\nKM-GPT integrates advanced image preprocessing, multi-modal reasoning powered\nby GPT-5, and iterative reconstruction algorithms to generate high-quality IPD\nwithout manual input or intervention. Its hybrid reasoning architecture\nautomates the conversion of unstructured information into structured data flows\nand validates data extraction from complex KM plots. To improve accessibility,\nKM-GPT is equipped with a user-friendly web interface and an integrated AI\nassistant, enabling researchers to reconstruct IPD without requiring\nprogramming expertise. KM-GPT was rigorously evaluated on synthetic and\nreal-world datasets, consistently demonstrating superior accuracy. To\nillustrate its utility, we applied KM-GPT to a meta-analysis of gastric cancer\nimmunotherapy trials, reconstructing IPD to facilitate evidence synthesis and\nbiomarker-based subgroup analyses.

This challenge is particularly\ncritical in indoor or complex facilities where GPS signals are weak and\ndetailed maps are unavailable. While chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has\nadvanced reasoning in language and vision tasks, its application to multimodal\nspatial orientation remains underexplored. We introduce Conversational\nOrientation Reasoning (COR), a new benchmark designed for Traditional Chinese\nconversational navigation projected from real-world environments, addressing\negocentric-to-allocentric reasoning in non-English and ASR-transcribed\nscenarios. We propose a multimodal chain-of-thought (MCoT) framework, which\nintegrates ASR-transcribed speech with landmark coordinates through a\nstructured three-step reasoning process: (1) extracting spatial relations, (2)\nmapping coordinates to absolute directions, and (3) inferring user orientation.\nA curriculum learning strategy progressively builds these capabilities on\nTaiwan-LLM-13B-v2.0-Chat, a mid-sized model representative of\nresource-constrained settings. Experiments show that MCoT achieves 100%\norientation accuracy on clean transcripts and 98.1% with ASR transcripts,\nsubstantially outperforming unimodal and non-structured baselines. Moreover,\nMCoT demonstrates robustness under noisy conversational conditions, including\nASR recognition errors and multilingual code-switching. The model also\nmaintains high accuracy in cross-domain evaluation and resilience to linguistic\nvariation, domain shift, and referential ambiguity. These findings highlight\nthe potential of structured MCoT spatial reasoning as a path toward\ninterpretable and resource-efficient embodied navigation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\ud654\ud615

The composition of\ntask vectors, a key operator in task arithmetic, enables models to integrate\nknowledge from multiple tasks without incurring additional inference costs. In\nthis paper, we propose variational task vector composition, where composition\ncoefficients are taken as latent variables and estimated in a Bayesian\ninference framework. Unlike previous methods that operate at the task level,\nour framework focuses on sample-specific composition. Motivated by the\nobservation of structural redundancy in task vectors, we introduce a\nSpike-and-Slab prior that promotes sparsity and preserves only the most\ninformative components. To further address the high variance and sampling\ninefficiency in sparse, high-dimensional spaces, we develop a gated sampling\nmechanism that constructs a controllable posterior by filtering the composition\ncoefficients based on both uncertainty and importance. This yields a more\nstable and interpretable variational framework by deterministically selecting\nreliable task components, reducing sampling variance while improving\ntransparency and generalization. Experimental results demonstrate that our\nmethod consistently outperforms existing approaches across all datasets by\nselectively leveraging the most reliable and informative components in task\nvectors. These findings highlight the practical value of our approach,\nestablishing a new standard for efficient and effective task vector\ncomposition.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294

Gradient tracking, an advanced technique for\nimproving the convergence rate in distributed optimization, has been applied to\nmost first-order algorithms in recent years. We first reveal the inherent\nprivacy leakage risk associated with gradient tracking. Building upon this\ninsight, we propose a weighted gradient tracking distributed privacy-preserving\nalgorithm, eliminating the privacy leakage risk in gradient tracking using\ndecaying weight factors. Then, we characterize the convergence of the proposed\nalgorithm under time-varying heterogeneous step sizes.

While BSM has been\nsuccessfully utilized in reinforcement learning (RL) for tasks like state\nrepresentation learning and policy exploration, its application to multiple-MDP\nscenarios, such as policy transfer, remains challenging. Prior work has\nattempted to generalize BSM to pairs of MDPs, but a lack of rigorous analysis\nof its mathematical properties has limited further theoretical progress. In\nthis work, we formally establish a generalized bisimulation metric (GBSM)\nbetween pairs of MDPs, which is rigorously proven with the three fundamental\nproperties: GBSM symmetry, inter-MDP triangle inequality, and the distance\nbound on identical state spaces. Leveraging these properties, we theoretically\nanalyse policy transfer, state aggregation, and sampling-based estimation in\nMDPs, obtaining explicit bounds that are strictly tighter than those derived\nfrom the standard BSM. Additionally, GBSM provides a closed-form sample\ncomplexity for estimation, improving upon existing asymptotic results based on\nBSM.

Mainstream multi-agent approaches can leverage external\nexperts, but inevitably introduce communication overhead and suffer from\ninefficient multimodal emergent capability and limited scalability. To this\nend, we propose PiMoE (Physically-isolated Mixture of Experts), a training and\ninference architecture for integrating computation and reasoning. Instead of\nthe workflow paradigm of tool invocation, PiMoE endogenously integrates\ncomputational capabilities into neural networks after separately training\nexperts, a text-to-computation module, and a router. At inference, the router\ndirects computation and reasoning at the token level, thereby enabling\niterative alternation within a single chain of thought. We evaluate PiMoE on\ntwo reasoning-computation tasks against LLM finetuning and the multi-agent\nsystem approaches. Results show that the PiMoE architecture achieves not only\nhigher accuracy than directly finetuning LLMs but also significant improvements\nin response latency, token usage, and GPU energy consumption compared with\nmainstream multi-agent approaches.

A common strategy to address this is through\nsymbolic formalisms, such as Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) or automata, which\nprovide a structured way to express temporally extended objectives. However,\nthese approaches often rely on restrictive assumptions -- such as the\navailability of a predefined Symbol Grounding (SG) function mapping raw\nobservations to high-level symbolic representations, or prior knowledge of the\ntemporal task. In this work, we propose a fully learnable version of Neural\nReward Machines (NRM), which can learn both the SG function and the automaton\nend-to-end, removing any reliance on prior knowledge. Our approach is therefore\nas easily applicable as classic deep RL (DRL) approaches, while being far more\nexplainable, because of the finite and compact nature of automata. Furthermore,\nwe show that by integrating Fully Learnable Reward Machines (FLNRM) with DRL,\nour method outperforms previous approaches based on Recurrent Neural Networks\n(RNNs).", "AI": {"tldr": "\ube44\ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc791\uc5c5\uc740 \ucd5c\uc801 \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ub0b4\ub9ac\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0c1\ud0dc-\ud589\ub3d9 \uc30d\uc758 \uc804\uccb4 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \ucd94\ub860\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ubbc0\ub85c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uace0\uae09 \uae30\ud638 \ud45c\ud604\uc73c\ub85c \ub9e4\ud551\ud558\ub294 \uc0ac\uc804 \uc815\uc758\ub41c \uae30\ud638 \uadfc\uac70(SG) \ud568\uc218\ub098 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0ac\uc804 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uac70\ud55c \uc644\uc804 \ud559\uc2b5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc2e0\uacbd \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uae30\uacc4(NRM)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ube44\ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ub0b4\ub9ac\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0c1\ud0dc-\ud589\ub3d9 \uc30d\uc758 \uc804\uccb4 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \ucd94\ub860\ud574\uc57c \ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ud070 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc2e0\uacbd \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uae30\uacc4(NRM)\uc758 \uc644\uc804 \ud559\uc2b5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubc84\uc804\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec, \uc0ac\uc804 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 SG \ud568\uc218\uc640 \uc790\ub3d9\uc790\ub97c \uc5d4\ub4dc \ud22c \uc5d4\ub4dc\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uace0\uc804\uc801\uc778 \uc2ec\uce35 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(DRL) \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\ucc98\ub7fc \uc27d\uac8c \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4, \uc790\ub3d9\uc790\uc758 \uc720\ud55c\ud558\uace0 \ucef4\ud329\ud2b8\ud55c \ud2b9\uc131 \ub355\ubd84\uc5d0 \ud6e8\uc52c \ub354 \uc124\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\ud574\uc9d1\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc644\uc804 \ud559\uc2b5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uae30\uacc4(FLNRM)\ub97c DRL\uacfc \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uba74, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc774\uc804\uc758 \uc21c\ud658 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(RNN) \uae30\ubc18 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ub2a5\uac00\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ube44\ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL) \uc791\uc5c5\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ub0b4\ub9ac\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0c1\ud0dc-\ud589\ub3d9 \uc30d\uc758 \uc804\uccb4 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \ucd94\ub860\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ubbc0\ub85c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uc804\ub7b5\uc740 \uc120\ud615 \uc2dc\uac04 \ub17c\ub9ac(LTL)\ub098 \uc624\ud1a0\ub9c8\ud0c0\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc0c1\uc9d5\uc801 \ud615\uc2dd\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c, \uc2dc\uac04\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ub41c \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ud45c\ud604\ud558\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uc6d0\uc2dc \uad00\uce21\uce58\ub97c \uace0\uc218\uc900 \uc0c1\uc9d5\uc801 \ud45c\ud604\uc73c\ub85c \ub9e4\ud551\ud558\ub294 \uc0ac\uc804 \uc815\uc758\ub41c \uae30\ud638 \uadfc\uac70(SG) \ud568\uc218\uc758 \uac00\uc6a9\uc131\uc774\ub098 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0ac\uc804 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc778 \uac00\uc815\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 SG \ud568\uc218\uc640 \uc624\ud1a0\ub9c8\ud0c0\ub97c \uc5d4\ub4dc \ud22c \uc5d4\ub4dc\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc644\uc804 \ud559\uc2b5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc2e0\uacbd \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uae30\uacc4(NRM)\uc758 \ubc84\uc804\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc0ac\uc804 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uac70\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uace0\uc804\uc801\uc778 \uc2ec\uce35 RL(DRL) \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\ucc98\ub7fc \uc27d\uac8c \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4, \uc624\ud1a0\ub9c8\ud0c0\uc758 \uc720\ud55c\ud558\uace0 \ucef4\ud329\ud2b8\ud55c \ud2b9\uc131 \ub355\ubd84\uc5d0 \ud6e8\uc52c \ub354 \uc124\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\ud574\uc9d1\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub354\uc6b1\uc774 \uc644\uc804 \ud559\uc2b5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uae30\uacc4(FLNRM)\ub97c DRL\uacfc \ud1b5\ud569\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc21c\ud658 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(RNN) \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc774\uc804 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ub2a5\uac00\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

When evaluated in a new task, instead of making\nparameter updates, the pretrained agent conditions its policy on additional\ninput called the context, e.g., the agent's interaction history in the new\ntask. The agent's performance increases as the information in the context\nincreases, with the agent's parameters fixed. This phenomenon is typically\ncalled in-context RL (ICRL). The pretrained parameters of the agent network\nenable the remarkable ICRL phenomenon. However, many ICRL works perform the\npretraining with standard RL algorithms. This raises the central question this\npaper aims to address: Why can the RL pretraining algorithm generate network\nparameters that enable ICRL? We hypothesize that the parameters capable of ICRL\nare minimizers of the pretraining loss. This work provides initial support for\nthis hypothesis through a case study. In particular, we prove that when a\nTransformer is pretrained for policy evaluation, one of the global minimizers\nof the pretraining loss can enable in-context temporal difference learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828 \ud6c4 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8 \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc774\uc720\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc911 \ud559\uc2b5\ud55c \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130\ub85c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc218\ud589\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810.", "method": "\uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc190\uc2e4\uc758 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ucd5c\uc18c\uac12\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574, Transformer\uac00 \uc815\ucc45 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub420 \ub54c in-context temporal difference learning\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc784.", "result": "\uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc190\uc2e4\uc758 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ucd5c\uc18c\uac12 \uc911 \ud558\ub098\uac00 ICRL\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud568\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud568.", "conclusion": "\uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc1c\uacac\uc740 ICRL \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uae30\ucd08 \uc790\ub8cc\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud604\ub300 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc\uc5d0\ub294 \uc77c\ubd80 RL \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc791\uc5c5 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828 \ud6c4 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8 \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uad00\ucc30\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud560 \ub54c \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \ud558\ub294 \ub300\uc2e0, \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uc774\ub825\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ucd94\uac00 \uc785\ub825\uc778 '\ubb38\ub9e5'\uc5d0 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc870\uac74\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubb38\ub9e5\uc758 \uc815\ubcf4\uac00 \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uace0\uc815\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub85c \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c in-context RL (ICRL)\uc774\ub77c\uace0 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\uac00 \uc8fc\ubaa9\ud560 \ub9cc\ud55c ICRL \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ub9ce\uc740 ICRL \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud45c\uc900 RL \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc774 \ub2e4\ub8e8\uace0\uc790 \ud558\ub294 \uc911\uc2ec \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \uc81c\uae30\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: RL \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc774 ICRL\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uac00? \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 ICRL\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\uac00 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc190\uc2e4\uc758 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\uae30\ub77c\uace0 \uac00\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc0ac\ub840 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774 \uac00\uc124\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucd08\uae30 \uc9c0\uc6d0\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Transformer\uac00 \uc815\ucc45 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub420 \ub54c, \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc190\uc2e4\uc758 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ucd5c\uc18c\uac12 \uc911 \ud558\ub098\uac00 in-context temporal difference learning\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

This paper introduces FedFiTS, a trust and\nfairness-aware selective FL framework that advances the FedFaSt line by\ncombining fitness-based client election with slotted aggregation. FedFiTS\nimplements a three-phase participation strategy-free-for-all training, natural\nselection, and slotted team participation-augmented with dynamic client\nscoring, adaptive thresholding, and cohort-based scheduling to balance\nconvergence efficiency with robustness. A theoretical convergence analysis\nestablishes bounds for both convex and non-convex objectives under standard\nassumptions, while a communication-complexity analysis shows reductions\nrelative to FedAvg and other baselines. Experiments on diverse datasets-medical\nimaging (X-ray pneumonia), vision benchmarks (MNIST, FMNIST), and tabular\nagricultural data (Crop Recommendation)-demonstrate that FedFiTS consistently\noutperforms FedAvg, FedRand, and FedPow in accuracy, time-to-target, and\nresilience to poisoning attacks.

Offline RL also encounters challenges in aligning learned\npolicies with observed human behavior in healthcare applications. To address\nchallenges in applying offline RL to physical activity promotion for older\nadults at high risk of falls, based on wearable sensor activity monitoring, we\nintroduce Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks and Diffusion Policies for Offline Inverse\nReinforcement Learning (KANDI). By leveraging the flexible function\napproximation in Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, we estimate reward functions by\nlearning free-living environment behavior from low-fall-risk older adults\n(experts), while diffusion-based policies within an Actor-Critic framework\nprovide a generative approach for action refinement and efficiency in offline\nRL. We evaluate KANDI using wearable activity monitoring data in a two-arm\nclinical trial from our Physio-feedback Exercise Program (PEER) study,\nemphasizing its practical application in a fall-risk intervention program to\npromote physical activity among older adults. Additionally, KANDI outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods on the D4RL benchmark. These results underscore\nKANDI's potential to address key challenges in offline RL for healthcare\napplications, offering an effective solution for activity promotion\nintervention strategies in healthcare.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub099\uc0c1 \uc704\ud5d8\uc774 \ub192\uc740

We present\nFedFusion, a federated transfer-learning framework that unifies domain\nadaptation and frugal labelling with diversity-/cluster-aware encoders (DivEn,\nDivEn-mix, DivEn-c). Labelled teacher clients guide learner clients via\nconfidence-filtered pseudo-labels and domain-adaptive transfer, while clients\nmaintain personalised encoders tailored to local data. To preserve global\ncoherence under heterogeneity, FedFusion employs similarity-weighted classifier\ncoupling (with optional cluster-wise averaging), mitigating dominance by\ndata-rich sites and improving minority-client performance.

However, existing diffusion models for time series generation require\nretraining the entire framework to introduce specific conditional guidance.\nThere also exists a certain degree of distributional bias between the generated\ndata and the real data, which leads to potential model biases in downstream\ntasks. Additionally, the complexity of diffusion models and the latent spaces\nleads to an uninterpretable inference process. To address these issues, we\npropose the data style-guided diffusion model (DS-Diffusion). In the\nDS-Diffusion, a diffusion framework based on style-guided kernels is developed\nto avoid retraining for specific conditions. The time-information based\nhierarchical denoising mechanism (THD) is developed to reduce the\ndistributional bias between the generated data and the real data. Furthermore,\nthe generated samples can clearly indicate the data style from which they\noriginate. We conduct comprehensive evaluations using multiple public datasets\nto validate our approach. Experimental results show that, compared to the\nstate-of-the-art model such as ImagenTime, the predictive score and the\ndiscriminative score decrease by 5.56% and 61.55%, respectively. The\ndistributional bias between the generated data and the real data is further\nreduced, the inference process is also more interpretable. Moreover, by\neliminating the need to retrain the diffusion model, the flexibility and\nadaptability of the model to specific conditions are also enhanced.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c \uac00\uc774\ub4dc \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378(DS-Diffusion)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \ud6c8\ub828 \uc7ac\uc870\uc815 \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 \uc870\uac74\ubd80 \uac00\uc774\ub4dc\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0 \uc0dd\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uac04\uc758 \ubd84\ud3ec \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uba70, \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc0dd\uc131\uc6a9 \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc870\uac74\ubd80 \uac00\uc774\ub4dc\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc804\uccb4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc7ac\ud6c8\ub828\ud574\uc57c \ud558\uace0, \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uac04\uc758 \ubd84\ud3ec \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc774 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\uc5ec downstream \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa8\ub378 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uc7a0\uc7ac \uacf5\uac04\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ucd94\ub860 \uacfc\uc815\uc774 \ud574\uc11d \ubd88\uac00\ub2a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "DS-Diffusion\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c \uac00\uc774\ub4dc \ucee4\ub110\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \ud655\uc0b0 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc5ec \ud2b9\uc815 \uc870\uac74\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud6c8\ub828 \uc7ac\uc870\uc815 \uc5c6\uc774 \ud574\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc2dc\uac04 \uc815\ubcf4 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ub178\uc774\uc988 \uc81c\uac70 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998(THD)\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc5ec \uc0dd\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uac04\uc758 \ubd84\ud3ec \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \uc904\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ube44\uad50 \ud3c9\uac00 \uacb0\uacfc, \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ubaa8\ub378\uc778 ImagenTime\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc608\uce21 \uc810\uc218\ub294 5.56%, \uad6c\ubcc4 \uc810\uc218\ub294 61.55% \uac10\uc18c\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc0dd\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uac04\uc758 \ubd84\ud3ec \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc774 \ub354\uc6b1 \uc904\uc5b4\ub4e4\uace0 \ucd94\ub860 \uacfc\uc815\uc774 \ub354 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud574\uc84c\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc7ac\ud6c8\ub828 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uac70\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc870\uac74\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc720\uc5f0\uc131\uacfc \uc801\uc751\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf30\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc8fc\ub958 \ubc29\ubc95\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc870\uac74\ubd80 \uac00\uc774\ub4dc\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc804\uccb4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc7ac\ud6c8\ub828\ud574\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uac04\uc758 \ubd84\ud3ec \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc774 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc6b4\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9bc \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801\uc778 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc9c8 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uc7a0\uc7ac \uacf5\uac04\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ud574\uc11d\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \ucd94\ub860 \uacfc\uc815\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c \uac00\uc774\ub4dc \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378(DS-Diffusion)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Unlike traditional subspace clustering methods that assume\nvectorized data, our formulation directly models each data sample as a matrix\nand clusters them according to their underlying subspaces. We establish\nconceptual links to Subspace Clustering and Generalized Canonical Correlation\nAnalysis (GCCA), and clarify key differences that arise in this more general\nsetting. Our approach is based on a Block Term Decomposition (BTD) of a\nthird-order tensor constructed from the input matrices, enabling joint\nestimation of cluster memberships and partially shared subspaces.

Existing methods often depend on specific network\narchitectures or require numerous queries, resulting in limited\ncross-architecture transferability and high query costs. To address these\nlimitations, we propose JAD, a latent diffusion model framework for black-box\nadversarial attacks. JAD generates adversarial examples by leveraging a latent\ndiffusion model guided by attention maps distilled from both a convolutional\nneural network (CNN) and a Vision Transformer (ViT) models. By focusing on\nimage regions that are commonly sensitive across architectures, this approach\ncrafts adversarial perturbations that transfer effectively between different\nmodel types.

However, most existing works on scaling laws primarily\nfocus on the final-step loss, overlooking the loss dynamics during the training\nprocess and, crucially, the impact of learning rate schedule (LRS). In this\npaper, we aim to bridge this gap by studying a teacher-student kernel\nregression setup trained via online stochastic gradient descent (SGD).\nLeveraging a novel intrinsic time viewpoint and stochastic differential\nequation (SDE) modeling of SGD, we introduce the Functional Scaling Law (FSL),\nwhich characterizes the evolution of population risk during the training\nprocess for general LRSs. Remarkably, the impact of the LRSs is captured\nthrough an explicit convolution-type functional term, making their effects\nfully tractable. To illustrate the utility of FSL, we analyze three widely used\nLRSs -- constant, exponential decay, and warmup-stable-decay (WSD) -- under\nboth data-limited and compute-limited regimes. We provide theoretical\njustification for widely adopted empirical practices in LLMs pre-training such\nas (i) higher-capacity models are more data- and compute-efficient; (ii)\nlearning rate decay can improve training efficiency; (iii) WSD-like schedules\ncan outperform direct-decay schedules. Lastly, we explore the practical\nrelevance of FSL as a surrogate model for fitting, predicting and optimizing\nthe loss curves in LLM pre-training, with experiments conducted across model\nsizes ranging from 0.1B to 1B parameters. We hope our FSL framework can deepen\nthe understanding of LLM pre-training dynamics and provide insights for\nimproving large-scale model training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uc548\ub0b4\ud558\ub294 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1 \ubc95\uce59\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\uac00 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc84c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc18d\ub3c4 \uc77c\uc815(LRS)\uc758 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8e8\uba70, \uae30\ub2a5\uc801 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1 \ubc95\uce59(FSL)\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec LRS\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \ud6c8\ub828 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc704\ud5d8 \uc9c4\ud654\ub97c \ud2b9\uc131\ud654\ud588\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud6c8\ub828 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc190\uc2e4 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559 \ubc0f \ud559\uc2b5 \uc18d\ub3c4 \uc77c\uc815\uc758 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud568.", "method": "\uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uacbd\uc0ac \ud558\uac15\ubc95(SGD)\uc73c\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uad50\uc0ac-\ud559\uc0dd \ucee4\ub110 \ud68c\uadc0 \uc124\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uae30\ub2a5\uc801 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1 \ubc95\uce59(FSL)\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785.", "result": "\uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 LRS(\uc0c1\uc218, \uc9c0\uc218 \uac10\uc18c, \uc6dc\uc5c5-\uc548\uc815-\uac10\uc18c)\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc815\ub2f9\ud654\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0, \ubaa8\ub378 \ud06c\uae30\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc190\uc2e4 \uace1\uc120 \uc608\uce21 \ubc0f \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "FSL \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 LLM\uc758 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uae4a\uc774 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud6c8\ub828 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud560 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \uae30\ub300\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1 \ubc95\uce59\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uc548\ub0b4\ud558\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud574\uc654\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1 \ubc95\uce59\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc8fc\ub85c \ucd5c\uc885 \uc190\uc2e4\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\ud558\uace0, \ud6c8\ub828 \uacfc\uc815 \ub3d9\uc548\uc758 \uc190\uc2e4 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uacfc \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ud559\uc2b5 \uc18d\ub3c4 \uc77c\uc815(LRS)\uc758 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uac04\uacfc\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uacbd\uc0ac \ud558\uac15\ubc95(SGD)\uc73c\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uad50\uc0ac-\ud559\uc0dd \ucee4\ub110 \ud68c\uadc0 \uc124\uc815\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \uba54\uc6b0\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc0c8\ub86d\uace0 \ub0b4\uc7ac\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\uac04 \uad00\uc810\uacfc SGD\uc758 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \ubbf8\ubd84 \ubc29\uc815\uc2dd(SDE) \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 LRS\uc758 \ud6c8\ub828 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc9d1\ub2e8 \uc704\ud5d8\uc758 \uc9c4\ud654\ub97c \ud2b9\uc131\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uae30\ub2a5\uc801 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1 \ubc95\uce59(FSL)\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788, LRS\uc758 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc778 \ucee8\ubcfc\ub8e8\uc158 \ud0c0\uc785 \uae30\ub2a5 \ud56d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uc5ec \uadf8 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc644\uc804\ud788 \ud30c\uc545\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.

Numerical experiments on logistic regression\nvalidate these theoretical predictions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ubd84\uc0b0 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud6c8\ub828\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uc131\uc9c8\uc744 \uc548\uc815\uc131 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud6c8\ub828\uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uacac\uace0\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uacfc\uc801\ud569\uacfc \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uaca9\ucc28\uc758 \ud655\ub300 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub2e4\uac01\uc801 \uc190\uc2e4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud655\uc0b0 \uc804\ub7b5 \ud558\uc758 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud6c8\ub828\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc548\uc815\uc131 \uae30\ubc18 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc12d\ub3d9 \uac15\ub3c4\uc640 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub2e8\uacc4 \uc218\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uc624\ub958\uac00 \uc99d\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774\ub294 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uacbd\uc6b0\uc640 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\ub098, \ubd84\uc0b0 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc1c\uacac\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud655\ub9bd\ub41c \ub3c4\uad6c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud6c8\ub828\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uacac\uace0\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc885\uc885 \uacac\uace0\ud55c \uacfc\uc801\ud569\uacfc \ud655\ub300\ub41c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uaca9\ucc28\uc5d0 \uc2dc\ub2ec\ub9bd\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc \uc791\uc5c5\uc774 \ubd84\uc0b0 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud6c8\ub828\uc758 \uc218\ub834\uc744 \ud655\ub9bd\ud588\uc74c\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \uadf8 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ud2b9\uc131\uc740 \ud0d0\uad6c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ubcfc\ub85d \uc190\uc2e4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud655\uc0b0 \uc804\ub7b5 \ud558\uc758 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ud6c8\ub828\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc548\uc815\uc131 \uae30\ubc18 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uc624\ub958\uac00 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc12d\ub3d9 \uac15\ub3c4\uc640 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub2e8\uacc4 \uc218\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc99d\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uc600\uace0, \uc774\ub294 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uacbd\uc6b0\uc640 \uc77c\uce58\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ubd84\uc0b0 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc1c\uacac\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub85c\uc9c0\uc2a4\ud2f1 \ud68c\uadc0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc218\uce58 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc774 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}
