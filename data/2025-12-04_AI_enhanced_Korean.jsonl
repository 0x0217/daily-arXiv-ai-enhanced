Building an effective algorithmic trading system may require a professional team to develop and test over the years. In this paper, we propose an orchestration framework for financial agents, which aims to democratize financial intelligence to the general public. We map each component of the traditional algorithmic trading system to agents, including planner, orchestrator, alpha agents, risk agents, portfolio agents, backtest agents, execution agents, audit agents, and memory agent. We present two in-house trading examples. For the stock trading task (hourly data from 04/2024 to 12/2024), our approach achieved a return of $20.42\\%$, a Sharpe ratio of 2.63, and a maximum drawdown of $-3.59\\%$, while the S&P 500 index yielded a return of $15.97\\%$. For the BTC trading task (minute data from 27/07/2025 to 13/08/2025), our approach achieved a return of $8.39\\%$, a Sharpe ratio of $0.38$, and a maximum drawdown of $-2.80\\%$, whereas the BTC price increased by $3.80\\%$.

However, traditional centralized MAS architectures present significant challenges, including single points of failure, vulnerability to censorship, inherent scalability limitations, and critical trust issues. We propose a novel Decentralized Multi-Agent System (DMAS) architecture designed to overcome these fundamental problems by enabling trust-aware, scalable, and censorship-resistant interactions among autonomous agents. Our DMAS features a decentralized agent runtime underpinned by a blockchain-based architecture.

Most current governance practices still rely on single-agent safety containment, prompts, fine-tuning, and moderation layers that constrain individual model behavior but leave the dynamics of multi-model interaction ungoverned. These mechanisms assume a dyadic setting: one model responding to one user under stable oversight. Yet research and industrial development are rapidly shifting toward LLM-to-LLM ecosystems, where outputs are recursively reused as inputs across chains of agents. In such systems, local compliance can aggregate into collective failure even when every model is individually aligned. We propose a conceptual transition from model-level safety to system-level safety, introducing the framework of the Emergent Systemic Risk Horizon (ESRH) to formalize how instability arises from interaction structure rather than from isolated misbehavior. The paper contributes (i) a theoretical account of collective risk in interacting LLMs, (ii) a taxonomy connecting micro, meso, and macro-level failure modes, and (iii) a design proposal for InstitutionalAI, an architecture for embedding adaptive oversight within multi-agent systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uac04 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c \uc548\uc804 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8f8.", "motivation": "\uc778\uac04-\ubaa8\ub378 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc548\uc804 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774 LLM \uac04 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc801\uc6a9\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \uc774\uc720\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud568.", "method": "\ubaa8\ub378 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \uac1c\ub150\uc801 \uc804\ud658\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0 Emergent Systemic Risk Horizon(ESRH) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785.", "result": "LLM \uac04 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc801 \uc704\ud5d8, \uc2e4\ud328 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ubd84\ub958, \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uac10\ub3c5\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 InstitutionalAI \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \uc124\uacc4 \uc81c\uc548.", "conclusion": "\uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uad6c\uc870\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd88\uc548\uc815\uc131\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 LLM \uac04 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc548\uc804 \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc778\uac04-\ubaa8\ub378 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc548\uc804 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc65c \ud655\uc7a5\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud604\uc7ac \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4 \uad00\ud589\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc548\uc804 \uad6c\uc18d, \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8, \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815 \ubc0f \uac1c\ubcc4 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc81c\uc57d\ud558\ub294 \uc870\uc815 \uacc4\uce35\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc758 \uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uaddc\uc81c\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc740 \uc548\uc815\ub41c \uac10\ub3c5 \uc544\ub798\uc5d0\uc11c \ud558\ub098\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud558\ub098\uc758 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc5d0\uac8c \uc751\ub2f5\ud558\ub294 \uc774\ud56d \uc124\uc815\uc744 \uac00\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc5f0\uad6c \ubc0f \uc0b0\uc5c5 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc740 LLM \uac04 \uc0dd\ud0dc\uacc4 \ucabd\uc73c\ub85c \ube60\ub974\uac8c \uc774\ub3d9\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc5ec\uae30\uc11c \ucd9c\ub825\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uccb4\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uc7ac\uadc0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc785\ub825\uc73c\ub85c \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc801 \uc900\uc218\uac00 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uac1c\ubcc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc77c\uce58\ud560 \ub54c\uc870\ucc28 \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc801 \uc2e4\ud328\ub85c \uc9d1\ud569\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \uac1c\ub150\uc801 \uc804\ud658\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uad6c\uc870\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd88\uc548\uc815\uc131\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 Emergent Systemic Risk Horizon(ESRH) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 (i) \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 LLM\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc801 \uc704\ud5d8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc124\uba85, (ii) \ubbf8\uc2dc, \uc911\uac04, \uac70\uc2dc \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc2e4\ud328 \ubaa8\ub4dc\uc640 \uc5f0\uacb0\ub418\ub294 \ubd84\ub958\ud559, (iii) \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uac10\ub3c5\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 InstitutionalAI\ub77c\ub294 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc124\uacc4 \uc81c\uc548\uc744 \uae30\uc5ec\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Rosas"], "title": "From monoliths to modules: Decomposing transducers for efficient world modelling", "comment": null, "summary": "World models have been recently proposed as sandbox environments in which AI agents can be trained and evaluated before deployment. Although realistic world models often have high computational demands, efficient modelling is usually possible by exploiting the fact that real-world scenarios tend to involve subcomponents that interact in a modular manner. In this paper, we explore this idea by developing a framework for decomposing complex world models represented by transducers, a class of models generalising POMDPs. Whereas the composition of transducers is well understood, our results clarify how to invert this process, deriving sub-transducers operating on distinct input-output subspaces, enabling parallelizable and interpretable alternatives to monolithic world modelling that can support distributed inference. Overall, these results lay a groundwork for bridging the structural transparency demanded by AI safety and the computational efficiency required for real-world inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubaa8\ub4c8 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ud558\uc704 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ubd84\ud574\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AI \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ud22c\uba85\uc131\uacfc \uc2e4\uc81c \uc138\uacc4 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uacc4\uc0b0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uc5f0\uacb0\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uae30\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc804\uc774\uae30(transducer)\ub85c \ud45c\ud604\ub41c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ubd84\ud574\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc804\uc774\uae30\uc758 \uc870\ud569\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0, \uac1c\ubcc4 \uc785\ub825-\ucd9c\ub825 \ud558\uc704\uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\ub294 \ud558\uc704 \uc804\uc774\uae30\ub97c \ud30c\uc0dd\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uba85\ud655\ud788 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 AI \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ud22c\uba85\uc131\uacfc \uc2e4\uc81c \uc138\uacc4 \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uacc4\uc0b0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \uae30\ubc18\uc744 \ub9c8\ub828\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ubc30\ud3ec \uc804\uc5d0 \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\uace0 \ud3c9\uac00\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc0cc\ub4dc\ubc15\uc2a4 \ud658\uacbd\uc73c\ub85c \ucd5c\uadfc\uc5d0 \uc81c\uc548\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \ub192\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc694\uad6c\ub97c \uac00\uc9c0\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc2e4\uc81c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uac00 \ubaa8\ub4c8 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ud558\uc704 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 POMDP\ub97c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud55c \uc885\ub958\uc778 \uc804\uc774\uae30\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ubd84\ud574\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc544\uc774\ub514\uc5b4\ub97c \ud0d0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc804\uc774\uae30\uc758 \uc870\ud569\uc740 \uc798 \uc774\ud574\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc774 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ubc18\uc804\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uba85\ud655\ud788 \ud558\uc5ec, \uad6c\ubcc4\ub41c \uc785\ub825-\ucd9c\ub825 \ud558\uc704\uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\ub294 \ud558\uc704 \uc804\uc774\uae30\ub97c \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\ubbc0\ub85c, \ubd84\uc0b0 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubaa8\ub180\ub9ac\uc2dd \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc758 \ubcd1\ub82c\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub300\uc548\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc804\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 AI \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc774 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ud22c\uba85\uc131\uacfc \uc2e4\uc81c \uc138\uacc4 \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uacc4\uc0b0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

This process typically involves a brute force search of the known binder (query) against a molecular library using some metric of molecular similarity. One popular approach overlays the pharmacophore-shape profile of the known binder to 3D conformations enumerated for each of the library molecules, computes overlaps, and picks a set of diverse library molecules with high overlaps. While this virtual screening workflow has had considerable success in hit diversification, scaffold hopping, and patent busting, it scales poorly with library sizes and restricts candidate generation to existing library compounds. Leveraging recent advances in voxel-based generative modelling, we propose a pharmacophore-based generative model and workflows that address the scaling and fecundity issues of conventional pharmacophore-based virtual screening. We introduce \\emph{VoxCap}, a voxel captioning method for generating SMILES strings from voxelised molecular representations. We propose two workflows as practical use cases as well as benchmarks for pharmacophore-based generation: \\emph{de-novo} design, in which we aim to generate new molecules with high pharmacophore-shape similarities to query molecules, and fast search, which aims to combine generative design with a cheap 2D substructure similarity search for efficient hit identification. Our results show that VoxCap significantly outperforms previous methods in generating diverse \\textit{de-novo} hits. When combined with our fast search workflow, VoxCap reduces computational time by orders of magnitude while returning hits for all query molecules, enabling the search of large libraries that are intractable to search by brute force.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub9ac\uac04\ub4dc \uae30\ubc18 \uc57d\ubb3c \ubc1c\uacac(LBDD)\uc740 \uc54c\ub824\uc9c4 \uacb0\ud569\uccb4\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec

We present DialogGuard, a multi-agent framework for assessing psychosocial risks in LLM-generated responses along five high-severity dimensions: privacy violations, discriminatory behaviour, mental manipulation, psychological harm, and insulting behaviour. DialogGuard can be applied to diverse generative models through four LLM-as-a-judge pipelines, including single-agent scoring, dual-agent correction, multi-agent debate, and stochastic majority voting, grounded in a shared three-level rubric usable by both human annotators and LLM judges. Using PKU-SafeRLHF with human safety annotations, we show that multi-agent mechanisms detect psychosocial risks more accurately than non-LLM baselines and single-agent judging; dual-agent correction and majority voting provide the best trade-off between accuracy, alignment with human ratings, and robustness, while debate attains higher recall but over-flags borderline cases. We release Dialog-Guard as open-source software with a web interface that provides per-dimension risk scores and explainable natural-language rationales.

The recently proposed Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as a unifying framework for integrating external tools into agent systems, enabling a thriving open ecosystem of community-built functionalities. However, the openness and composability that make MCP appealing also introduce a critical yet overlooked security assumption -- implicit trust in third-party tool providers. In this work, we identify and formalize a new class of attacks that exploit this trust boundary without violating explicit permissions. We term this new attack vector implicit toxicity, where malicious behaviors occur entirely within the allowed privilege scope. We propose LeechHijack, a Latent Embedded Exploit for Computation Hijacking, in which an adversarial MCP tool covertly expropriates the agent's computational resources for unauthorized workloads. LeechHijack operates through a two-stage mechanism: an implantation stage that embeds a benign-looking backdoor in a tool, and an exploitation stage where the backdoor activates upon predefined triggers to establish a command-and-control channel. Through this channel, the attacker injects additional tasks that the agent executes as if they were part of its normal workflow, effectively parasitizing the user's compute budget. We implement LeechHijack across four major LLM families. Experiments show that LeechHijack achieves an average success rate of 77.25%, with a resource overhead of 18.62% compared to the baseline.

While agents enable multi-step reasoning, persistent memory, and tool orchestration, deploying them indiscriminately leads to higher cost, complexity, and risk.\n  We present STRIDE (Systematic Task Reasoning Intelligence Deployment Evaluator), a framework that provides principled recommendations for selecting between three modalities: (i) direct LLM calls, (ii) guided AI assistants, and (iii) fully autonomous agentic AI. STRIDE integrates structured task decomposition, dynamism attribution, and self-reflection requirement analysis to produce an Agentic Suitability Score, ensuring that full agentic autonomy is reserved for tasks with inherent dynamism or evolving context.\n  Evaluated across 30 real-world tasks spanning SRE, compliance, and enterprise automation, STRIDE achieved 92% accuracy in modality selection, reduced unnecessary agent deployments by 45%, and cut resource costs by 37%. Expert validation over six months in SRE and compliance domains confirmed its practical utility, with domain specialists agreeing that STRIDE effectively distinguishes between tasks requiring simple LLM calls, guided assistants, or full agentic autonomy. This work reframes agent adoption as a necessity-driven design decision, ensuring autonomy is applied only when its benefits justify the costs.", "AI": {"tldr": "STRIDE \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc791\uc6a9 AI\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc5ec \uc9c1\uc811 LLM \ud638\ucd9c, \uc548\ub0b4 AI \ub3c4\uc6b0\ubbf8, \uc644\uc804 \uc790\uc728 \uc791\uc6a9 AI \uc911\uc5d0\uc11c \uc120\ud0dd\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ub3d5\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ub9ac\uc778\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \ud544\uc694\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc790\uc728 AI\ub97c \uc5b8\uc81c \uc801\uc6a9\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc9c8\ubb38\uc774 \uc81c\uae30\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "STRIDE\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc791\uc5c5 \ubd84\ud574, \ub3d9\uc801 \uc18d\uc131 \ud560\ub2f9, \uc790\uae30 \ubc18\uc131 \uc694\uad6c \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \uc801\ud569\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "30\uac1c\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c 92%\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub85c \ubaa8\ub4dc \uc120\ud0dd\uc744 \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ud589\ud558\uace0 \ubd88\ud544\uc694\ud55c \ub300\ub9ac\uc778 \ubc30\uce58\ub97c 45% \uc904\uc600\uc73c\uba70 \uc790\uc6d0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 37% \uc808\uac10\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc791\uc6a9 \ucc44\ud0dd\uc744 \ud544\uc694 \uae30\ubc18 \uc124\uacc4 \uacb0\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uc790\uc728\uc131\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uacbd\uc6b0\uc5d0\ub9cc \uc801\uc6a9\ub418\ub3c4\ub85d \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubb34\uc0c1\ud0dc \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc9c0\ud5a5\uc801\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c\uc758 \uae09\uc18d\ud55c \uc804\ud658\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI\uac00 \uc9c4\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc2dc\uc810\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc911\uc2ec \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \uc81c\uae30\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ucd94\ub860, \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801 \uae30\uc5b5, \ub3c4\uad6c \uc870\uc815 \ub4f1\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub97c \ubb34\ubd84\ubcc4\ud558\uac8c \ubc30\ud3ec\ud558\uba74 \ube44\uc6a9, \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131 \ubc0f \uc704\ud5d8\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 STRIDE(\uccb4\uacc4\uc801 \uc791\uc5c5 \ucd94\ub860 \uc9c0\ub2a5 \ubc30\ud3ec \ud3c9\uac00\uae30)\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc9c1\uc811 LLM \ud638\ucd9c, \uc548\ub0b4 AI \ub3c4\uc6b0\ubbf8 \ubc0f \uc644\uc804 \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI\uc758 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc591\uc2dd \uc911 \uc120\ud0dd\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc6d0\uce59\uc801\uc778 \uad8c\uc7a5 \uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, existing GCL approaches with structural augmentations often struggle to identify task-relevant topological structures, let alone adapt to the varying coarse-to-fine topological granularities required across different downstream tasks. To remedy this issue, we introduce Hierarchical Topological Granularity Graph Contrastive Learning (HTG-GCL), a novel framework that leverages transformations of the same graph to generate multi-scale ring-based cellular complexes, embodying the concept of topological granularity, thereby generating diverse topological views. Recognizing that a certain granularity may contain misleading semantics, we propose a multi-granularity decoupled contrast and apply a granularity-specific weighting mechanism based on uncertainty estimation. Comprehensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of HTG-GCL, highlighting its superior performance in capturing meaningful graph representations through hierarchical topological information.", "AI": {"tldr": "Hierarchical Topological Granularity Graph Contrastive Learning (HTG-GCL)\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uad00\uc810\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uc758\ubbf8 \uc788\ub294 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ub300\uc870 \ud559\uc2b5(GCL) \ubc29\uc2dd\ub4e4\uc774 \uc791\uc5c5 \uad00\ub828 \ud1a0\ud3f4\ub85c\uc9c0 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uc81c\ub300\ub85c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uace0, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub2e4\uc6b4\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9bc \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ud1a0\ud3f4\ub85c\uc9c0 \uc138\ubd84\ud654\ub97c \uc801\uc751\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "HTG-GCL\uc740 \ub3d9\uc77c \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc758 \ubcc0\ud658\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc911 \uaddc\ubaa8\uc758 \ub9c1 \uae30\ubc18 \uc140\ub8f0\ub7ec \ubcf5\ud569\uccb4\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \ud1a0\ud3f4\ub85c\uc9c0 \uc138\ubd84\ud654 \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \uad6c\ud604\ud558\uace0, \ub2e4\ucc44\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud1a0\ud3f4\ub85c\uc9c0 \uad00\uc810\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, misleading semantics\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc138\ubd84\ud654\ub97c \uc778\uc9c0\ud558\uace0, \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ucd94\uc815\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uc138\ubd84\ud654 \ud2b9\uc815 \uac00\uc911\uce58 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 HTG-GCL\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ud1a0\ud3f4\ub85c\uc9c0 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc788\ub294 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "HTG-GCL\uc740 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ub300\uc870 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc801\uc751\ub825\uc744 \ub192\uc778\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ub300\uc870 \ud559\uc2b5(GCL)\uc740 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ud1a0\ud3f4\ub85c\uc9c0 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \uacf5\uc720\ud558\ub294 \ub3d9\uc77c \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc758 \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \uad00\uc810\uc744 \ub300\uc870\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uad6c\ubcc4\ub418\ub294 \uc758\ubbf8 \ubd88\ubcc0\uc131\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc99d\uac15\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \uae30\uc874 GCL \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc791\uc5c5 \uad00\ub828 \ud1a0\ud3f4\ub85c\uc9c0 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uc73c\uba70, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub2e4\uc6b4\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9bc \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc694\uad6c\ub418\ub294 \uac70\uce5c-\ubbf8\uc138 \ud1a0\ud3f4\ub85c\uc9c0 \uc138\ubd84\ud654\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\ud558\uae30\ub3c4 \ud798\ub4ed\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ud1a0\ud3f4\ub85c\uc9c0 \uc138\ubd84\ud654 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ub300\uc870 \ud559\uc2b5(HTG-GCL)\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\ub294\ub370, \uc774\ub294 \ub3d9\uc77c \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc758 \ubcc0\ud658\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc911 \uaddc\ubaa8\uc758 \ub9c1 \uae30\ubc18 \uc140\ub8f0\ub7ec \ubcf5\ud569\uccb4\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \ud1a0\ud3f4\ub85c\uc9c0 \uc138\ubd84\ud654 \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \uad6c\ud604\ud558\uace0, \ub2e4\uc591\ud558\uace0 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc788\ub294 \ud1a0\ud3f4\ub85c\uc9c0 \uad00\uc810\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5b4\ub5a4 \uc138\ubd84\ud654\uac00 \uc624\ud574\uc758 \uc18c\uc9c0\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc778\uc2dd\ud558\uace0, \ub2e4\uc911 \uc138\ubd84\ud654 \ubd84\ub9ac \ub300\uc870\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ucd94\uc815\uc744 \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \uc138\ubd84\ud654 \ud2b9\uc815 \uac00\uc911\uce58 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 HTG-GCL\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc5ec, \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ud1a0\ud3f4\ub85c\uc9c0 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc788\ub294 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\uc5b4 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Unlike traditional systems that require pre-defined graphs or specialized programming, IACT operates as a general-purpose autonomous system driven purely by user dialogue. Given a high-level objective, the system autonomously grows a dynamic, recursive agent topology incrementally tailored to the problem's structure. This allows it to scale its organizational complexity to match open-ended tasks. To mitigate the error propagation inherent in unidirectional function calls, IACT introduces interactional redundancy by replacing rigid invocations with bidirectional, stateful dialogues. This mechanism enables runtime error correction and ambiguity resolution.

There is no single dataset that documents cyber attacks against space infrastructures that have occurred in the past; instead, these incidents are often scattered in media reports while missing many details, which we dub the missing-data problem. Nevertheless, even ``low-quality'' datasets containing such reports would be extremely valuable because of the dearth of space cybersecurity data and the sensitivity of space infrastructures which are often restricted from disclosure by governments. This prompts a research question: How can we characterize real-world cyber attacks against space infrastructures? In this paper, we address the problem by proposing a framework, including metrics, while also addressing the missing-data problem by leveraging methodologies such as the Space Attack Research and Tactic Analysis (SPARTA) and the Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge (ATT&CK) to ``extrapolate'' the missing data in a principled fashion. We show how the extrapolated data can be used to reconstruct ``hypothetical but plausible'' space cyber kill chains and space cyber attack campaigns that have occurred in practice. To show the usefulness of the framework, we extract data for 108 cyber attacks against space infrastructures and show how to extrapolate this ``low-quality'' dataset containing missing information to derive 6,206 attack technique-level space cyber kill chains. Our findings include: cyber attacks against space infrastructures are getting increasingly sophisticated; successful protection of the link segment between the space and user segments could have thwarted nearly half of the 108 attacks.

To address this gap, this dissertation extends TheAgentCompany with a finance-focused environment and investigates whether a general purpose LLM agent can complete representative wealth-management tasks both accurately and economically. This study introduces synthetic domain data, enriches colleague simulations, and prototypes an automatic task-generation pipeline. The study aims to create and assess an evaluation set that can meaningfully measure an agent's fitness for assistant-level wealth management work. We construct a benchmark of 12 task-pairs for wealth management assistants spanning retrieval, analysis, and synthesis/communication, with explicit acceptance criteria and deterministic graders. We seeded a set of new finance-specific data and introduced a high vs. low-autonomy variant of every task. The paper concluded that agents are limited less by mathematical reasoning and more so by end-to-end workflow reliability, and meaningfully affected by autonomy level, and that incorrect evaluation of

Here, we provide a proof-of-concept analysis that shows how machine learning (ML) methods can be applied to a simple macroeconomic model of the Doughnut. First, we show how ML methods can be used to find policy parameters that are consistent with 'living within the Doughnut'. Second, we show how a reinforcement learning agent can identify the optimal trajectory towards desired policies in the parameter space. The approaches we test, which include a Random Forest Classifier and $Q$-learning, are frugal ML methods that are able to find policy parameter combinations that achieve both environmental and social sustainability.

In practice, however, the transparency is split across two worlds: verifiable on-chain traces and off-chain disclosures locked in unstructured text that are unconnected. We introduce a large language model (LLM)-based automated framework that bridges these two dimensions by aligning on-chain issuance data with off-chain disclosure statements. First, we propose an integrative framework using LLMs to capture and analyze on- and off-chain data through document parsing and semantic alignment, extracting key financial indicators from issuer attestations and mapping them to corresponding on-chain metrics. Second, we integrate multi-chain issuance records and disclosure documents within a model context protocol (MCP) framework that standardizes LLMs access to both quantitative market data and qualitative disclosure narratives. This framework enables unified retrieval and contextual alignment across heterogeneous stablecoin information sources and facilitates consistent analysis. Third, we demonstrate the capability of LLMs to operate across heterogeneous data modalities in blockchain analytics, quantifying discrepancies between reported and observed circulation and examining their implications for cross-chain transparency and price dynamics. Our findings reveal systematic gaps between disclosed and verifiable data, showing that LLM-assisted analysis enhances cross-modal transparency and supports automated, data-driven auditing in

However, their reliability and robustness under adversarial or faulty conditions remain largely unexamined, despite operating in high-risk, irreversible financial environments. We propose TradeTrap, a unified evaluation framework for systematically stress-testing both adaptive and procedural autonomous trading agents. TradeTrap targets four core components of autonomous trading agents: market intelligence, strategy formulation, portfolio and ledger handling, and trade execution, and evaluates their robustness under controlled system-level perturbations. All evaluations are conducted in a closed-loop historical backtesting setting on real US equity market data with identical initial conditions, enabling fair and reproducible comparisons across agents and attacks. Extensive experiments show that small perturbations at a single component can propagate through the agent decision loop and induce extreme concentration, runaway exposure, and large portfolio drawdowns across both agent types, demonstrating that current autonomous trading agents can be systematically misled at the system level.

Our goal is to establish the improved efficiency and performance gains achieved by integrating online model selection methods into reinforcement learning training procedures. We examine the theoretical characterizations that are effective for identifying the right configuration in practice, and address three practical criteria from a theoretical perspective: 1) Efficient resource allocation, 2) Adaptation under non-stationary dynamics, and 3) Training stability across different seeds. Our theoretical results are accompanied by empirical evidence from various model selection tasks in reinforcement learning, including neural architecture selection, step-size selection, and self model selection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc120\ud0dd \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8ec\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc120\ud0dd \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc808\ucc28\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc131\ub2a5 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4\uc5d0 \uc811\uadfc\ud558\uace0 \uc801\uc808\ud55c \uad6c\uc131\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774\ub860\uc801 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc801\uc808\ud55c \uad6c\uc131\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0, \uc790\uc6d0 \ud560\ub2f9, \ube44\uc815\uc0c1 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc801\uc751, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc2dc\ub4dc\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc758 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8ec\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubaa8\ub378 \uc120\ud0dd \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\uc99d\uc801 \uc99d\uac70\uc640 \ud568\uaed8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud6c8\ub828 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc120\ud0dd \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uba70, \uc120\ud0dd\uc790\ub294 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4\uc5d0 \uc811\uadfc\ud558\uace0 \uc801\uc808\ud55c \uad6c\uc131\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ubc30\uc6b4\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub294 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc120\ud0dd \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc808\ucc28\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ub2ec\uc131\ub41c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc131\ub2a5 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ud655\ub9bd\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc801\uc808\ud55c \uad6c\uc131\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uace0, \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\ub8ec\ub2e4: 1) \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc790\uc6d0 \ud560\ub2f9, 2) \ube44\uc815\uc0c1 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc801\uc751, 3) \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc2dc\ub4dc\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc548\uc815\uc131. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc2e0\uacbd \uad6c\uc870 \uc120\ud0dd, \ub2e8\uacc4 \ud06c\uae30 \uc120\ud0dd, \uc790\uae30 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc120\ud0dd\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378 \uc120\ud0dd \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc2e4\uc99d\uc801 \uc99d\uac70\uc640 \ud568\uaed8 \uc81c\uacf5\ub41c\ub2e4."}}

In 2025, Cybersecurity AI (CAI) systematically conquered some of the world's most prestigious hacking competitions, achieving Rank #1 at multiple events and consistently outperforming thousands of human teams. Across five major circuits-HTB's AI vs Humans, Cyber Apocalypse (8,129 teams), Dragos OT CTF, UWSP Pointer Overflow, and the Neurogrid CTF showdown-CAI demonstrated that Jeopardy-style CTFs have become a solved game for well-engineered AI agents. At Neurogrid, CAI captured 41/45 flags to claim the $50,000 top prize; at Dragos OT, it sprinted 37% faster to 10K points than elite human teams; even when deliberately paused mid-competition, it maintained top-tier rankings. Critically, CAI achieved this dominance through our specialized alias1 model architecture, which delivers enterprise-scale AI security operations at unprecedented cost efficiency and with augmented autonomy-reducing 1B token inference costs from $5,940 to just $119, making continuous security agent operation financially viable for the first time. These results force an uncomfortable reckoning: if autonomous agents now dominate competitions designed to identify top security talent at negligible cost, what are CTFs actually measuring? This paper presents comprehensive evidence of AI capability across the 2025 CTF circuit and argues that the security community must urgently transition from Jeopardy-style contests to Attack & Defense formats that genuinely test adaptive reasoning and resilience-capabilities that remain uniquely human, for now.", "AI": {"tldr": "2025\ub144 Cybersecurity AI(CAI)\uac00 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ud574\ud0b9 \ub300\ud68c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uac04 \ud300\uc744 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\uba70 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \uac70\ub450\uc5c8\uace0, \uc774\ub294 CTF\uc758 \uc720\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \uc758\ubb38\uc2dc\ud558\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4e0\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AI\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc774 CTF \ub300\ud68c\uc758 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc744 \ubcc0\ud654\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "CAI\ub294 \ud2b9\uc815\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc5ec\ub7ec \ud574\ud0b9 \ub300\ud68c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "CAI\ub294 2025\ub144 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc8fc\uc694 CTF \ub300\ud68c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uac04 \ud300\uc744 \uc555\ub3c4\ud558\uba70 1\uc704\ub97c \uae30\ub85d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubcf4\uc548 \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ud2f0\ub294 CTF \ud615\uc2dd\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc97\uc5b4\ub098 \uc9c4\uc815\ud55c \uc801\uc751\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \ud68c\ubcf5\ub825\uc744 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub300\ud68c \ud615\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\ud658\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "2025\ub144, \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548 AI(CAI)\uac00 \uc138\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uac00\uc7a5 \uad8c\uc704 \uc788\ub294 \ud574\ud0b9 \ub300\ud68c\ub97c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\ubcf5\ud558\uc5ec \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c 1\uc704\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uc218\ucc9c \uac1c\uc758 \uc778\uac04 \ud300\uc744 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ucd08\uc6d4\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Move features a strong static type system and explicit resource semantics to enforce safety properties such as the prevention of data races, invalid asset transfers, and entry vulnerabilities. However, smart contracts written in Move may still contain certain vulnerabilities that are beyond the reach of its type system. It is thus essential to validate Move smart contracts. Unfortunately, due to its strong type system, existing smart contract fuzzers are ineffective in producing syntactically or semantically valid transactions to test Move smart contracts. This paper introduces the first fuzzing framework, Belobog, for Move smart contracts. Belobog is type-aware and ensures that all generated and mutated transactions are well-typed. More specifically, for a target Move smart contract, Belobog first constructs a type graph based on Move's type system, and then generates or mutates a transaction based on the graph trace derived from the type graph. In order to overcome the complex checks in Move smart contracts, we further design and implement a concolic executor in Belobog. We evaluated Belobog on 109 real-world Move smart contract projects. The experimental results show that Belobog is able to detect 100\\% critical and 79\\% major vulnerabilities manually audited by human experts. We further selected two recent notorious incidents in Move smart contracts, i.e., Cetus and Nemo. Belobog successfully reproduced full exploits for both of them, without any prior knowledge.", "AI": {"tldr": "Move\ub780 \uc548\uc804\ud558\uace0 \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uacc4\uc57d \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c \uc9c0\ud5a5\uc758 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d \uc5b8\uc5b4\ub85c, Sui \ubc0f Aptos\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ube14\ub85d\uccb4\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uc218\uc2ed\uc5b5 \uac1c\uc758 \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uc790\uc0b0 \uad00\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub41c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 Move\ub85c \uc791\uc131\ub41c \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uacc4\uc57d\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ud2b9\uc815 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc774 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\uba70, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud37c\uc800\ub294 syntactically \ub610\ub294 semantically \uc720\ud6a8\ud55c \ud2b8\ub79c\uc7ad\uc158\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud55c\uacc4\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 Move \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uacc4\uc57d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \ud37c\uc9d5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Belobog\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uace0, Belobog\uc774 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc0dd\uc131\ub418\uace0 \ubcc0\ud615\ub41c \ud2b8\ub79c\uc7ad\uc158\uc774 \uc798 \uc720\ud615\ud654\ub418\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, Belobog\uc740 \uc218\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uac10\uc0ac\ub41c 100%\uc758 \uc911\ub300\ud55c \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uacfc 79%\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "motivation": "Move \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d \uc5b8\uc5b4\ub294 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uacc4\uc57d \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294\ub370, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uacc4\uc57d \ud37c\uc800\uac00 Move\uc758 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ud0c0\uc785 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc720\ud6a8\ud55c \ud2b8\ub79c\uc7ad\uc158\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "Belobog\ub294 Move\uc758 \ud0c0\uc785 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud0c0\uc785 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \ud2b8\ub79c\uc7ad\uc158\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ubcc0\ud615\ud558\uba70, \ub610\ud55c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uccb4\ud06c\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 Belobog\uc5d0 \ucee8\ucf5c\ub9ac\uc2dd \uc2e4\ud589\uae30\ub97c \uc124\uacc4 \ubc0f \uad6c\ud604\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "Belobog\ub97c 109\uac1c\uc758 \uc2e4\uc138\uacc4 Move \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uacc4\uc57d \ud504\ub85c\uc81d\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, 100%\uc758 \uc911\ub300\ud55c \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uacfc 79%\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc720\uba85\ud55c \uc0ac\uac74\uc778 Cetus\uc640 Nemo\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc644\uc804\ud55c \uc775\uc2a4\ud50c\ub85c\uc787\uc744 \uc7ac\ud604\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Belobog\ub294 Move \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uacc4\uc57d\uc758 \ud0c0\uc785 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc778\uc2dd\ud558\uc5ec \uc798 \uc720\ud615\ud654\ub41c \ud2b8\ub79c\uc7ad\uc158\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0, \ub9ce\uc740 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \uc2e4\uc81c\ub85c \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc784\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "Move\ub294 \uc548\uc804\ud558\uace0 \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uacc4\uc57d \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc5f0\uad6c \uc9c0\ud5a5\uc758 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d \uc5b8\uc5b4\uc774\uba70, Sui\uc640 Aptos\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ube14\ub85d\uccb4\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uc218\uc2ed\uc5b5 \uac1c\uc758 \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uc790\uc0b0 \uad00\ub9ac\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.

We address this critical challenge by achieving 95.5% Dice score using just 599 training images for breast cell segmentation, where just 4% of pixels represent breast tissue and 60% of images contain no breast regions. Our framework uses quantum-inspired edge enhancement via multi-scale Gabor filters creating a fourth input channel, enhancing boundary detection where inter-annotator variations reach +/- 3 pixels. We present a stabilized multi-component loss function that integrates adaptive Dice loss with boundary-aware terms and automatic positive weighting to effectively address severe class imbalance, where mammary epithelial cell regions comprise only 0.1%-20% of the total image area. Additionally, a complexity-based weighted sampling strategy is introduced to prioritize the challenging mammary epithelial cell regions. The model employs an EfficientNet-B7/UNet++ architecture with a 4-to-3 channel projection, enabling the use of pretrained weights despite limited medical imaging data. Finally, robust validation is achieved through exponential moving averaging and statistical outlier detection, ensuring reliable performance estimates on a small validation set (129 images). Our framework achieves a Dice score of 95.5% +/- 0.3% and an IoU of 91.2% +/- 0.4%. Notably, quantum-based enhancement contributes to a 2.1% improvement in boundary accuracy, while weighted sampling increases small lesion detection by 3.8%. By achieving groundbreaking performance with limited annotations, our approach significantly reduces the medical expert time required for dataset creation, addressing a fundamental bottleneck in

Allocating spaces for on-street parking, further hinders traffic flow, by limiting the effective road width available for driving. With the advancement of vehicle-to-infrastructure connectivity technologies, we explore how the impact of on-street parking on traffic congestion could be minimized, by dynamically configuring on-street parking spaces. Towards that end, we formulate dynamic on-street parking space configuration as an optimization problem, and we follow a data driven approach, considering the nature of our problem. Our proposed solution comprises a two-layer multi agent reinforcement learning based framework, which is inherently scalable to large road networks. The lane level agents are responsible for deciding the optimal parking space configuration for each lane, and we introduce a novel Deep Q-learning architecture which effectively utilizes long short term memory networks and graph attention networks to capture the spatio-temporal correlations evident in the given problem. The block level agents control the actions of the lane level agents and maintain a sufficient level of parking around the block. We conduct a set of comprehensive experiments using SUMO, on both synthetic data as well as real-world data from the city of Melbourne.

Traditional optimization approaches rely on large-scale online experiments or parameter tuning over predefined statistical models, which are costly, time-consuming, and may disrupt player experience. Although simplified offline simulation systems are often adopted as alternatives, their limited fidelity prevents agents from accurately mimicking real player reasoning and reactions to interventions. To address these limitations, we propose a generative agent-based MMO simulation system empowered by Large Language Models (LLMs). By applying Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) on large-scale real player behavioral data, we adapt LLMs from general priors to game-specific domains, enabling realistic and interpretable player decision-making. In parallel, a data-driven environment model trained on real gameplay logs reconstructs dynamic in-game systems. Experiments demonstrate strong consistency with real-world player behaviors and plausible causal responses under interventions, providing a reliable, interpretable, and cost-efficient framework for data-driven numerical design optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub2e4\uc778 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uac8c\uc784\uc5d0\uc11c \ud50c\ub808\uc774\uc5b4 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc744

Due to the underlying dynamics misalignment between the source and target domain, simply merging the data from two datasets may incur inferior performance. Recent advances address this issue by selectively sharing source domain samples that exhibit dynamics alignment with the target domain. However, these approaches focus solely on dynamics alignment and overlook \\textit{value alignment}, i.e., selecting high-quality, high-value samples from the source domain. In this paper, we first demonstrate that both dynamics alignment and value alignment are essential for policy learning, by examining the limitations of the current theoretical framework for cross-domain RL and establishing a concrete sub-optimality gap of a policy trained on the source domain and evaluated on the target domain. Motivated by the theoretical insights, we propose to selectively share those source domain samples with both high dynamics and value alignment and present our \\textbf{\\underline{D}}ynamics- and \\textbf{\\underline{V}}alue-aligned \\textbf{\\underline{D}}ata \\textbf{\\underline{F}}iltering (DVDF) method. We design a range of dynamics shift settings, including kinematic and morphology shifts, and evaluate DVDF on various tasks and datasets, as well as in challenging extremely low-data settings where the target domain dataset contains only 5,000 transitions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DVDF consistently outperforms prior strong baselines and delivers exceptional performance across multiple tasks and datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774

We present an agentic AI pipeline that autonomously (i) clusters markets into coherent topical groups using natural-language understanding over contract text and metadata, and (ii) identifies within-cluster market pairs whose resolved outcomes exhibit strong dependence, including same-outcome (correlated) and different-outcome (anti-correlated) relationships. Using a historical dataset of resolved markets on Polymarket, we evaluate the accuracy of the agent's relational predictions. We then translate discovered relationships into a simple trading strategy to quantify how these relationships map to actionable signals. Results show that agent-identified relationships achieve roughly 60-70% accuracy, and their induced trading strategies earn about 20% average returns over week-long horizons, highlighting the ability of agentic AI and large language models to uncover latent semantic structure in prediction markets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc608\uce21 \uc2dc\uc7a5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubd84\uc0b0 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc790\uc728\uc801 AI \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc2dc\uc7a5 \uac04\uc758 \uac15\ud55c \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \uae30\ucd08\ub85c \uac70\ub798 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc218\ub9bd\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc608\uce21 \uc2dc\uc7a5\uc740 \ud604\uc2e4 \uc138\uacc4 \uc0ac\uac74\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uac70\ub798\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc911\ubcf5 \uc9c8\ubb38, \uc554\ubb35\uc801 \ub3d9\ub4f1\uc131 \ubc0f \uc2dc\uc7a5 \uac04 \uc228\uaca8\uc9c4 \ubaa8\uc21c\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc815\ubcf4\uac00 \ub2e8\ud3b8\ud654\ub418\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc790\uc728\uc801 AI \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc774 \uacc4\uc57d \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ubc0f \uba54\ud0c0\ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uc774\ud574\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc2dc\uc7a5\uc744 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uc8fc\uc81c \uadf8\ub8f9\uc73c\ub85c \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130\ub9c1\ud558\uace0, \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130 \ub0b4\uc758 \uc30d \uac04 \uac15\ud55c \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\ub294 \uc2dc\uc7a5 \uc30d\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uacfc\uac70 Polymarket\uc758 \ud574\uacb0\ub41c \uc2dc\uc7a5 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uad00\uacc4 \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud55c \uad00\uacc4\ub294 \uc57d 60-70%\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\uace0, \uc774\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \uac70\ub798 \uc804\ub7b5\uc740 \uc8fc\uac04 \ud3c9\uade0 \uc57d 20% \uc218\uc775\uc744 \uc62c\ub838\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 AI\uc640 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc608\uce21 \uc2dc\uc7a5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc228\uaca8\uc9c4 \uc758\ubbf8 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc608\uce21 \uc2dc\uc7a5\uc740 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\ub4e4\uc774 \ud604\uc2e4 \uc138\uacc4 \uc0ac\uac74\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uac70\ub798\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc911\ubcf5\ub41c \uc9c8\ubb38, \uc554\ubb35\uc801 \ub3d9\ub4f1\uc131 \ubc0f \uc2dc\uc7a5 \uac04 \uc228\uaca8\uc9c4 \ubaa8\uc21c\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ub2e8\ud3b8\ud654\ub418\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c (i) \uacc4\uc57d \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ubc0f \uba54\ud0c0\ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uc774\ud574\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc2dc\uc7a5\uc744 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uc8fc\uc81c \uadf8\ub8f9\uc73c\ub85c \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130\ub9c1\ud558\uace0, (ii) \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc(\uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4) \ubc0f \ub2e4\ub978 \uacb0\uacfc(\ubc18\uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4) \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uac15\ud55c \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\ub294 \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130 \ub0b4 \uc2dc\uc7a5 \uc30d\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud574\uacb0\ub41c \uc2dc\uc7a5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacfc\uac70 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uad00\uacc4 \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc774\ud6c4 \ubc1c\uacac\ub41c \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \uac70\ub798 \uc804\ub7b5\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uad00\uacc4\uac00 \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc2e0\ud638\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ub9e4\ud551\ub418\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4. \uacb0\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud55c \uad00\uacc4\ub294 \uc57d 60-70%\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc720\ub3c4\ub41c \uac70\ub798 \uc804\ub7b5\uc740 \uc8fc\uac04 \ud3c9\uade0 \uc57d 20%\uc758 \uc218\uc775\uc744 \uc62c\ub838\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI\uc640 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc608\uce21 \uc2dc\uc7a5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc228\uaca8\uc9c4 \uc758\ubbf8 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

Accepted at AAAI 2026 TrustAgent Workshop", "summary": "Solving complex or long-horizon problems often requires large language models (LLMs) to use external tools and operate over a significantly longer context window. New LLMs enable longer context windows and support tool calling capabilities. Prior works have focused mainly on evaluation of LLMs on long-context prompts, leaving agentic setup relatively unexplored, both from capability and safety perspectives. Our work addresses this gap. We find that LLM agents could be sensitive to length, type, and placement of the context, exhibiting unexpected and inconsistent shifts in task performance and in refusals to execute harmful requests. Models with 1M-2M token context windows show severe degradation already at 100K tokens, with performance drops exceeding 50\\% for both benign and harmful tasks. Refusal rates shift unpredictably: GPT-4.1-nano increases from $\\sim$5\\% to $\\sim$40\\% while Grok 4 Fast decreases from $\\sim$80\\% to $\\sim$10\\% at 200K tokens. Our work shows potential safety issues with agents operating on longer context and opens additional questions on the current metrics and paradigm for evaluating LLM agent safety on long multi-step tasks. In particular, our results on LLM agents reveal a notable divergence in both capability and safety performance compared to prior evaluations of LLMs on similar criteria.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uae34 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \uc548\uc804\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud0d0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e8\uae30\uc801\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0\uc744 \uc704\ud574 LLM\uc758 \uc678\ubd80 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uacfc \uae34 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ucc3d \uc6b4\uc601 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uae34 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ubbfc\uac10\ud558\uac8c \ubc18\uc751\ud558\uace0, \uc608\uae30\uce58 \uc54a\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ubaa8\ub378\uc740 1M-2M \ud1a0\ud070\uc758 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ucc3d\uc5d0\uc11c 100K \ud1a0\ud070\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5 \uc800\ud558\ub97c \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, \uac70\ubd80\uc728 \ub610\ud55c \uc608\uce21 \ubd88\uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ubcc0\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uae34 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\ub294 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \uc548\uc804 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ubc1d\ud600\ub0b4\uace0, LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uae30\uc874 \uc9c0\ud45c\uc640 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucd94\uac00 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \uc81c\uae30\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubcf5\uc7a1\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uae34 \uc218\ud3c9 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uc678\ubd80 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uace0 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \uae34 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ucc3d\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\ub3d9\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 LLM\uc740 \ub354 \uae34 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ucc3d\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uace0 \ub3c4\uad6c \ud638\ucd9c \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud55c\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uae34 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c LLM\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0 \uc8fc\ub85c \uc9d1\uc911\ud558\uc600\uace0, \ub2a5\ub825 \ubc0f \uc548\uc804\uc131 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc124\uc815\uc740 \uc0c1\ub300\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubbf8\uac1c\ucc99 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub85c \ub0a8\uc544\uc788\uc5c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc774 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc758 \uae38\uc774, \uc720\ud615 \ubc0f \uc704\uce58\uc5d0 \ubbfc\uac10\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc791\uc5c5 \uc131\uacfc\uc640 \ud574\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc694\uccad \uc2e4\ud589 \uac70\ubd80\uc5d0\uc11c \uc608\uc0c1\uce58 \ubabb\ud55c \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc774 \uc5c6\ub294 \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \ubcf4\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. 1M-2M \ud1a0\ud070\uc758 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ucc3d\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc774\ubbf8 100K \ud1a0\ud070\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5 \uc800\ud558\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\uba70, \uc6b0\ud638\uc801\uc778 \uc791\uc5c5\uacfc \ud574\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc791\uc5c5 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5 \uc800\ud558\uac00 50%\n\ub97c \ucd08\uacfc\ud55c\ub2e4. \uac70\ubd80\uc728\uc740 \uc608\uce21 \ubd88\uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ubcc0\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4: GPT-4.1-nano\ub294 $\text{ \textasciitilde 5\text{\textapprle} }$\text{\uc5d0\uc11c $\text{ \textasciitilde 40\text{\textapprle} }$\ub85c \uc99d\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ubc18\uba74, Grok 4 Fast\ub294 200K \ud1a0\ud070\uc5d0\uc11c $\text{ \textasciitilde 80\text{\textapprle} }$\uc5d0\uc11c $\text{ \textasciitilde 10\text{\textapprle} }$\ub85c \uac10\uc18c\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uae34 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \uc548\uc804 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uace0, \uae34 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uc9c0\ud45c\uc640 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucd94\uac00\uc801\uc778 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \uc81c\uae30\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788, LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc774\uc804 LLM \ud3c9\uac00\uc640 \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec \ub2a5\ub825\uacfc \uc548\uc804 \uc131\ub2a5 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c \ub208\uc5d0 \ub744\ub294 \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b8\ub2e4."}}

Current moderation systems, often based on single models or fixed pipelines, exhibit limitations in identifying implicit risks and providing interpretable judgment processes. To address these issues, we propose Aetheria, a multimodal interpretable content safety framework based on multi-agent debate and collaboration.Employing a collaborative architecture of five core agents, Aetheria conducts in-depth analysis and adjudication of multimodal content through a dynamic, mutually persuasive debate mechanism, which is grounded by RAG-based knowledge retrieval.Comprehensive experiments on our proposed benchmark (AIR-Bench) validate that Aetheria not only generates detailed and traceable audit reports but also demonstrates significant advantages over baselines in overall content safety accuracy, especially in the identification of implicit risks. This framework establishes a transparent and interpretable paradigm, significantly advancing the field of trustworthy AI content moderation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Aetheria\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ub17c\uc7c1\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \ucf58\ud150\uce20 \uc548\uc804\uc131 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc554\ubb35\uc801 \uc704\ud5d8 \uc2dd\ubcc4\uacfc \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud310\ub2e8 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\uc758 \uc81c\ud55c\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \ucf58\ud150\uce20\uc758 \uae09\uaca9\ud55c \uc99d\uac00\ub85c \ucf58\ud150\uce20 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804\uc774 \ucee4\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "Aetheria\ub294 \ub2e4\uc12f \uac1c\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \ud611\ub825 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, RAG \uae30\ubc18 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uac80\uc0c9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ucf58\ud150\uce20\ub97c \uc2ec\uce35\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0 \ud310\ubcc4\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "Aetheria\ub294 \uc0c1\uc138\ud558\uace0 \ucd94\uc801 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uac10\uc0ac \ubcf4\uace0\uc11c\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uae30\ubcf8 \ubaa8\ub378 \ub300\ube44 \ucf58\ud150\uce20 \uc548\uc804\uc131 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc5d0\uc11c \ud604\uc800\ud55c \uc6b0\uc704\ub97c \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 AI \ucf58\ud150\uce20 \uc870\uc815 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud22c\uba85\ud558\uace0 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \ud655\ub9bd\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \ucf58\ud150\uce20\uc758 \uae30\ud558\uae09\uc218\uc801\uc778 \uc131\uc7a5\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ucf58\ud150\uce20 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc5d0 \uc911\ub300\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ub098\ud0c0\ub098\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uc870\uc815 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \ub2e8\uc77c \ubaa8\ub378 \ub610\ub294 \uace0\uc815 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uc5ec \uc554\ubb35\uc801 \uc704\ud5d8 \uc2dd\ubcc4\uacfc \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud310\ub2e8 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4\uc11c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ub17c\uc7c1\uacfc \ud611\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ucf58\ud150\uce20 \uc548\uc804\uc131 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Aetheria\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

However, existing studies primarily focus on train-time robustness (handling dynamics shifts from training data), neglecting the test-time robustness against dynamics perturbations when deployed in practical scenarios. In this paper, we investigate dual (both train-time and test-time) robustness against dynamics shifts in cross-domain offline RL. We first empirically show that the policy trained with cross-domain offline RL exhibits fragility under dynamics perturbations during evaluation, particularly when target domain data is limited. To address this, we introduce a novel robust cross-domain Bellman (RCB) operator, which enhances test-time robustness against dynamics perturbations while staying conservative to the out-of-distribution dynamics transitions, thus guaranteeing the train-time robustness. To further counteract potential value overestimation or underestimation caused by the RCB operator, we introduce two techniques, the dynamic value penalty and the Huber loss, into our framework, resulting in the practical \\textbf{D}ual-\\textbf{RO}bust \\textbf{C}ross-domain \\textbf{O}ffline RL (DROCO) algorithm.

This separation makes it impossible to support agentic, context-aware operations directly within LaTeX editors such as Overleaf. We present PaperDebugger, an in-editor, multi-agent, and plugin-based academic writing assistant that brings LLM-driven reasoning directly into the writing environment. Enabling such in-editor interaction is technically non-trivial: it requires reliable bidirectional synchronization with the editor, fine-grained version control and patching, secure state management, multi-agent scheduling, and extensible communication with external tools. PaperDebugger addresses these challenges through a Chrome-approved extension, a Kubernetes-native orchestration layer, and a Model Context Protocol (MCP) toolchain that integrates literature search, reference lookup, document scoring, and revision pipelines. Our demo showcases a fully integrated workflow, including localized edits, structured reviews, parallel agent execution, and diff-based updates, encapsulated within a minimal-intrusion user interface (UI). Early aggregated analytics demonstrate active user engagement and validate the practicality of an editor-native, agentic writing assistant.

However, executing agents at scale using high-capacity LLMs incurs high inference costs. We propose a simple method for reducing LLM agent inference costs without incurring the development friction costs associated with LLM fine-tuning (long training cycles, optimization hyperparameter tweaking loops) or manual prompt engineering (laborious trial and error). Most importantly, we introduce $\\textit{in-context distillation}$, which adapts the idea of knowledge distillation (training a low cost-student model to mimic a high-cost teacher) to an in-context learning setting. Our approach retrieves relevant teacher demonstrations at each agent step and provides them to the student as in-context examples, enabling the student to imitate teacher behavior on-the-fly. We combine in-context distillation with the established idea of $\\textit{self-consistency cascades}$ to know when the trust the student. This adaptive strategy realizes the cost benefits of model specialization while preserving the productivity of working with frozen models. On the multi-step embodied reasoning benchmark ALFWorld, our method matches teacher-level accuracy at $\\textbf{2.5$\\times$ lower cost}$, reducing per-episode costs from \\$0.059 to \\$0.024. The upfront demonstration cost amortizes after just 843 episodes, yielding cumulative savings exceeding \\$34,900 at deployment scale (1M episodes). On AppWorld, a complex agent benchmark requiring multi-step API workflows, we shift the Pareto frontier by achieving a $\\textbf{2$\\times$ cost reduction}$ at iso-accuracy. By reducing operational costs while maintaining rapid experimentation cycles with frozen models, our approach makes advanced agentic systems economically viable for a broader range of applications.",

Code available at: https://github.com/AlbMLpy/TN-FL-Model", "summary": "Many approximations were suggested to circumvent the cubic complexity of kernel-based algorithms, allowing their application to large-scale datasets. One strategy is to consider the primal formulation of the learning problem by mapping the data to a higher-dimensional space using tensor-product structured polynomial and Fourier features. The curse of dimensionality due to these tensor-product features was effectively solved by a tensor network reparameterization of the model parameters. However, another important aspect of model training - identifying optimal feature hyperparameters - has not been addressed and is typically handled using the standard cross-validation approach. In this paper, we introduce the Feature Learning (FL) model, which addresses this issue by representing tensor-product features as a learnable Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD). By leveraging this CPD structure, we efficiently learn the hyperparameters associated with different features alongside the model parameters using an Alternating Least Squares (ALS) optimization method. We prove the effectiveness of the FL model through experiments on real data of various dimensionality and scale. The results show that the FL model can be consistently trained 3-5 times faster than and have the prediction quality on par with a standard cross-validated model.", "AI": {"tldr": "FL \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ud150\uc11c-\ud504\ub85c\ub355\ud2b8 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c CPD\ub85c \ud45c\ud604\ud558\uc5ec \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130\ub97c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ucee4\ub110 \uae30\ubc18 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \uc138\uc81c\uacf1 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \ud68c\ud53c\ud558\uc5ec \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "FL \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ud150\uc11c-\ud504\ub85c\ub355\ud2b8 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c CPD\ub85c \ud45c\ud604\ud558\uace0, ALS \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "FL \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ucc28\uc6d0\uacfc \uaddc\ubaa8\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c \uc2e4\ud5d8\ud558\uc5ec 3-5\ubc30 \ub354 \ube60\ub974\uac8c \ud6c8\ub828\ub418\uace0 \uc608\uce21 \ud488\uc9c8\uc774 \ud45c\uc900 \uad50\ucc28 \uac80\uc99d \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ub3d9\ub4f1\ud568\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "FL \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \uc2dd\ubcc4 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0, \ucc98\ub9ac \uc18d\ub3c4 \ubc0f \uc608\uce21 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub9ce\uc740 \uadfc\uc0ac\uce58\uac00 \ucee4\ub110 \uae30\ubc18 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \uc138\uc81c\uacf1 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \ud68c\ud53c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc81c\uc548\ub418\uc5b4 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0 \uc751\uc6a9\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud55c \uac00\uc9c0 \uc804\ub7b5\uc740 \ud150\uc11c-\ud504\ub85c\ub355\ud2b8 \uad6c\uc870\uc758 \ub2e4\ud56d\uc2dd\uacfc \ud3ec\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \uacf5\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \ub9e4\ud551\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubb38\uc81c\uc758 \uae30\ubcf8 \uacf5\uc2dd\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud150\uc11c-\ud504\ub85c\ub355\ud2b8 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \ucc28\uc6d0\uc758 \uc800\uc8fc \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud150\uc11c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uc7ac\ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130\ud654\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uacb0\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud6c8\ub828\uc758 \ub610 \ub2e4\ub978 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uce21\uba74\uc778 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \ud2b9\uc9d5 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \uc2dd\ubcc4 \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \ub2e4\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc9c0\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uc73c\uba70 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud45c\uc900 \uad50\ucc28 \uac80\uc99d \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ucc98\ub9ac\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130\ub97c \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 ALTERNATING LEAST SQUARES (ALS) \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud150\uc11c-\ud504\ub85c\ub355\ud2b8 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c CPD\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\ub294 \ud2b9\uc9d5 \ud559\uc2b5(FL) \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ucc28\uc6d0\uacfc \uaddc\ubaa8\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 FL \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacb0\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c FL \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ud45c\uc900 \uad50\ucc28 \uac80\uc99d \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 3-5\ubc30 \ub354 \ube60\ub974\uac8c \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ud6c8\ub828\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70 \uc608\uce21 \ud488\uc9c8\uc740 \ub3d9\ub4f1\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Recent work has shown that interpreting LTL instructions as finite automata, which can be seen as high-level programs monitoring task progress, enables learning a single generalist policy capable of executing arbitrary instructions at test time. However, existing approaches fall short in environments where multiple high-level events (i.e., atomic propositions) can be true at the same time and potentially interact in complicated ways. In this work, we propose a novel approach to learning a multi-task policy for following arbitrary LTL instructions that addresses this shortcoming. Our method conditions the policy on sequences of simple Boolean formulae, which directly align with transitions in the automaton, and are encoded via a graph neural network (GNN) to yield structured task representations. Experiments in a complex chess-based environment demonstrate the advantages of our approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uace0\uae09 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc815\ucc45 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uace0\uc218\uc900 \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8\uac00 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 true\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd80\uc871\ud55c \uc810\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \ubd88\ub9ac\uc5b8 \uacf5\uc2dd\uc758 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\uc5d0 \uc870\uac74\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \uc790\ub3d9\uc790\uc758 \uc804\ud658\uacfc \uc9c1\uc811 \uc77c\uce58\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\uace0, \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(GNN)\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc791\uc5c5 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uccb4\uc2a4 \uae30\ubc18 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \uc7a5\uc810\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc784\uc758\uc758 LTL \uc9c0\uce68\uc744 \ub530\ub974\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc815\ucc45 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc120\ud615 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \ub17c\ub9ac(LTL)\ub294 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud558\uace0 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc9c0\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ub9e4\ub825\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0 \ub530\ub974\uba74, \uc791\uc5c5 \uc9c4\ud589 \uc0c1\ud669\uc744 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \uace0\uc218\uc900 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc73c\ub85c \ubcfc \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc720\ud55c \uc790\ub3d9\uae30\ub85c LTL \uc9c0\uce68\uc744 \ud574\uc11d\ud558\uba74 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc \uc784\uc758\uc758 \uc9c0\uce68\uc744 \uc2e4\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc77c\ubc18 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uace0\uc218\uc900 \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8(\uc989, \uc6d0\uc790 \uba85\uc81c)\uac00 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 true\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\uace0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd80\uc871\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub2e8\uc810\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \uc784\uc758\uc758 LTL \uc9c0\uce68\uc744 \ub530\ub974\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc815\ucc45 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\uc790\uc5d0\uc11c \uc804\ud658\uacfc \uc9c1\uc811 \uc77c\uce58\ud558\ub294 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \ubd88\ub9ac\uc5b8 \uacf5\uc2dd\uc758 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\uc5d0 \uc870\uac74\ud654\ud558\uace0, \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(GNN)\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc791\uc5c5 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uccb4\uc2a4 \uae30\ubc18 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc6b0\ub9ac \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \uc7a5\uc810\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Subsequently, a novel step-level Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) method, Step Reward Group Policy Optimization (SRGPO), is designed for the post-training of VLN agents. In SRGPO, we first define verifiable process rewards for the navigation task, and then perform efficient step-level advantage estimation by randomly grouping different navigation steps. SRGPO provides dense reward signals for the reinforcement learning process of the VLN agent and enhances its planning capability. Experimental results on the EmbodiedBench Navigation benchmark indicate that by introducing the zero-shot VP module, the GPT-4.1 achieves a navigation success rate of 86.7%, surpassing the current best LVLM by approximately 20 percentage points (pp). Through post-training based on SRGPO, the Qwen2.5-VL-3B model reaches a navigation success rate of 72.3%, outperforming the best existing LVLM model by 5.6 pp. Moreover, compared to RFT algorithms such as GRPO and GiGPO, the proposed SRGPO demonstrates significant improvements in training stability, convergence efficiency, and generalization capability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 VLN \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c SeeNav-Agent\uac00 \uc81c\uc548\ub418\uc5b4 \uc778\uc2dd \ubc0f \uacc4\ud68d \uc624\ub958\ub97c \uc904\uc774\uace0 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 VLN \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc778\uc2dd, \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \uacc4\ud68d \uc624\ub958\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ub0b4\ube44\uac8c\uc774\uc158 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc800\ud558\ub41c\ub2e4.", "method": "SeeNav-Agent \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc774\uc911 \uc2dc\uac01 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8(VP) \uae30\uc220\uacfc \ub2e8\uacc4 \uc218\uc900 \uac15\ud654 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815 \ubc29\ubc95(SRGPO)\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc778\uc2dd\uacfc \uacc4\ud68d \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc81c\uc548\ud55c VP \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 GPT-4.1\uc740 86.7%\uc758 \ub0b4\ube44\uac8c\uc774\uc158 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\uace0, SRGPO\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 Qwen2.5-VL-3B \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 72.3%\uc5d0 \ub3c4\ub2ec\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "SRGPO\ub294 \uae30\uc874\uc758 RFT \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc548\uc815\uc131, \uc218\ub834 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \ubc0f \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ube44\uc804-\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LVLM)\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \ube44\uc804-\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ub0b4\ube44\uac8c\uc774\uc158(VLN) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc778\uc2dd \uc624\ub958, \ucd94\ub860 \uc624\ub958 \ubc0f \uacc4\ud68d \uc624\ub958\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ub0b4\ube44\uac8c\uc774\uc158 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ud06c\uac8c \uc800\ud558\ub418\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 SeeNav-Agent\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 VLN \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uba3c\uc800, VLN \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ube44\uc8fc\uc5bc \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc758 \uc778\uc2dd \ud658\uac01\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc785\ub825 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\uc911 \uc2dc\uac01 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8(VP) \uae30\uc220\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud604\uc7ac \uacf5\uac04 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc774\ud574\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8 \ud6c4, VLN \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud6c4\uc18d \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ub2e8\uacc4 \uc218\uc900 \uac15\ud654 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815(RFT) \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 \ub2e8\uacc4 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uadf8\ub8f9 \uc815\ucc45 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654(SRGPO)\ub97c \uc124\uacc4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Understanding how specific training data contributes to a model's output is critical. We introduce a framework for interpreting generative outputs through the automatic construction of ontologyaligned knowledge graphs (KGs). While automatic KG construction from natural text has advanced, extracting structured and ontology-consistent representations from visual content remains challenging -- due to the richness and multi-object nature of images. Leveraging multimodal large language models (LLMs), our method extracts structured triples from images, aligned with a domain-specific ontology. By comparing the KGs of generated and training images, we can trace potential influences, enabling copyright analysis, dataset transparency, and interpretable AI.

However, their memorization-generalization behavior remains poorly understood. In this work, we revisit the flow matching (FM) objective and study its marginal velocity field, which admits a closed-form expression, allowing exact computation of the oracle FM target. Analyzing this oracle velocity field reveals that flow-based diffusion models inherently formulate a two-stage training target: an early stage guided by a mixture of data modes, and a later stage dominated by the nearest data sample. The two-stage objective leads to distinct learning behaviors: the early navigation stage generalizes across data modes to form global layouts, whereas the later refinement stage increasingly memorizes fine-grained details. Leveraging these insights, we explain the effectiveness of practical techniques such as timestep-shifted schedules, classifier-free guidance intervals, and latent space design choices.

Similarly, data-driven architectures typically require large datasets to perform predictive tasks with sufficient accuracy. A possible approach to mitigate these challenges is the development of multi-fidelity emulators, leveraging potentially biased, inexpensive low-fidelity information while correcting and refining predictions using scarce, accurate high-fidelity data. This study investigates the performance of multi-fidelity neural emulators, neural networks designed to learn the input-to-output mapping by integrating limited high-fidelity data with abundant low-fidelity model solutions. We investigate the performance of such emulators for low and high-dimensional functions, with oscillatory character, in the presence of discontinuities, for collections of models with equal and dissimilar parametrization, and for a possibly large number of potentially corrupted low-fidelity sources. In doing so, we consider a large number of architectural, hyperparameter, and dataset configurations including networks with a different amount of spectral bias (Multi-Layered Perceptron, Siren and Kolmogorov Arnold Network), various mechanisms for coordinate encoding, exact or learnable low-fidelity information, and for varying training dataset size. We further analyze the added value of the multi-fidelity approach by conducting equivalent single-fidelity tests for each case, quantifying the performance gains achieved through fusing multiple

While previous work established the AAI capability score as a static functional on the space of agent representations, this paper formalizes the agent as a flow $\u03bd_r$ parameterized by computational resource $r$, governed by a recursive Generator-Verifier-Updater (GVU) operator. We prove that this operator generates a vector field on the parameter manifold $\u0398$, and we identify the coefficient of self-improvement $\u03ba$ as the Lie derivative of the capability functional along this flow.\n  The central contribution of this work is the derivation of the Variance Inequality, a spectral condition that is sufficient (under mild regularity) for the stability of self-improvement. We show that a sufficient condition for $\u03ba> 0$ is that, up to curvature and step-size effects, the combined noise of generation and verification must be small enough.\n  We then apply this formalism to unify the recent literature on Language Self-Play (LSP), Self-Correction, and Synthetic Data bootstrapping. We demonstrate that architectures such as STaR, SPIN, Reflexion, GANs and AlphaZero are specific topological realizations of the GVU operator that satisfy the Variance Inequality through filtration, adversarial discrimination, or grounding in formal systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc2ec\ub9ac \uce21\uc815 \ubc30\ud130\ub9ac\uc758 \ubaa8\ub4c8 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3d9\uc801 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ubd84\uc57c\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c AAI \ub2a5\ub825 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud45c\ud604 \uacf5\uac04\uc758 \uc815\uc801 \ud568\uc218\ub85c \uc124\uc815\ud588\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc790\uc6d0\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ub9e4\uac1c\ub41c \ud750\ub984 $\u03bd_r$\ub85c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud615\uc2dd\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc7ac\uadc0\uc801\uc778 \uc0dd\uc131\uae30-\uac80\uc99d\uae30-\uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\uae30(GVU) \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc790\uac00 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \ub2e4\uc591\uccb4 $\u0398$\uc5d0\uc11c \ubca1\ud130 \ud544\ub4dc\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc790\uae30 \uac1c\uc120\uc758 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \ubd84\uc0b0 \ubd88\ud3c9\ub4f1\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uba70, $\u03ba> 0$\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ucda9\ubd84 \uc870\uac74\uc774 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubc0f \uac80\uc99d\uc758 \uacb0\ud569 \ub178\uc774\uc988\uac00 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \uc791\uc544\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ucd5c\uadfc \uc5b8\uc5b4 \uc790\uae30 \ub180\uc774(LSP), \uc790\uae30 \uc218\uc815 \ubc0f \ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd80\ud2b8\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub798\ud551 \ubb38\ud5cc\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc2ec\ub9ac \uce21\uc815 \ubc30\ud130\ub9ac\uc758 \ubaa8\ub4c8 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3d9\uc801 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ubd84\uc57c\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uc804 \uc791\uc5c5\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud45c\ud604\uc758 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c AAI \ub2a5\ub825 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \uc815\uc801\uc778 \ud568\uc218\ub85c \ud655\ub9bd\ud588\uc73c\ub098, \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc790\uc6d0 $r$\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ub9e4\uac1c\ub41c \ud750\ub984 $\u03bd_r$\ub85c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud615\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uba70 \uc7ac\uadc0\uc801\uc778 \uc0dd\uc131\uae30-\uac80\uc99d\uae30-\uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\uae30(GVU) \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc790\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc790\uac00 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \ub2e4\uc591\uccb4 $\u0398$\uc5d0\uc11c \ubca1\ud130 \ud544\ub4dc\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud558\uace0, \uc790\uae30 \uac1c\uc120\uc758 \uacc4\uc218 $\u03ba$\ub97c \uc774 \ud750\ub984\uc744 \ub530\ub77c \ub2a5\ub825 \uae30\ub2a5\uc758 \ub9ac \ud30c\uc0dd\ubb3c\ub85c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \uc911\uc2ec \uae30\uc5ec\ub294 \uc790\uae30 \uac1c\uc120\uc758 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ucda9\ubd84\ud55c \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7f4 \uc870\uac74\uc778 \ubd84\uc0b0 \ubd88\ud3c9\ub4f1\uc758 \ub3c4\ucd9c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 $\u03ba> 0$\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ucda9\ubd84\ud55c \uc870\uac74\uc774 \uace1\ub960 \ubc0f \uc2a4\ud15d \ud06c\uae30 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc0dd\uc131\uacfc \uac80\uc99d\uc758 \uacb0\ud569 \ub178\uc774\uc988\uac00 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \uc791\uc544\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7f0 \ub2e4\uc74c \uc774 \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ub97c \ucd5c\uadfc\uc758 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \uc790\uae30 \ub180\uc774(LSP), \uc790\uae30 \uc218\uc815 \ubc0f \ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd80\ud2b8\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub798\ud551\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \ubb38\ud5cc\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc801\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 STaR, SPIN, Reflexion, GAN \ubc0f AlphaZero\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uac00 \ud544\ud130\ub9c1, \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ubd84\ubcc4 \ub610\ub294 \ud615\uc2dd\uc801 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc758 \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \ud1b5\ud558\uc5ec \ubd84\uc0b0 \ubd88\ud3c9\ub4f1\uc744 \ub9cc\uc871\ud558\ub294 GVU \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc790\uc758 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc704\uc0c1\uc801 \uc2e4\ud604\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, existing methods rely on fixed-budget majority voting to estimate rewards, incurring substantial computational redundancy. We propose Optimal Rollout Allocation for Test-time Policy Optimization (OptPO), a principled framework that adaptively allocates inference budgets. By formulating the voting process as a Bayesian sequential probability ratio test, OptPO dynamically halts sampling once the posterior confidence in a consensus answer exceeds a specified threshold. Crucially, it utilizes the retained rollouts for on-policy updates, seamlessly integrating with algorithms like PPO or GRPO without requiring ground-truth labels. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks, OptPO significantly reduces rollout overhead compared to fixed-sample baselines while preserving or improving accuracy. By unifying statistically optimal stopping with test-time learning, OptPO offers a computationally efficient paradigm for test-time adaptation.

However, existing frameworks often lack mechanisms to verify and refine the outputs at each generation step, or rely heavily on manually designed prompts for self-refinement, which limits their adaptability and scalability. To address these limitations, we propose a prompt-free collaborative agent framework that automatically enhances the quality of paper-to-code generation. Our approach employs two collaborative agents: a verification agent that examines whether the outputs at each step satisfy the requirements specified in the corresponding system prompt, and a refinement agent that revises the outputs based on the identified issues. Unlike previous methods that require human experts to craft specific refinement prompts for each step, our framework achieves automatic verification and improvement by leveraging only the original system prompts. We integrate our collaborative agents into the Paper2Code framework and conduct comprehensive experiments on PaperBench Code-Dev and Paper2CodeBench datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the accuracy and completeness of reproduced code, achieving performance gains of approximately 15\\% and 13\\%, respectively, compared to the baseline without our agents. Furthermore, comparative experiments against Self-Refine validate the robustness and consistency of our prompt-free approach across different datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c

While prior work has predominantly focused on parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification for such models, we address the fundamental problem of minimax hypothesis testing for $\\mathcal{T}_F$ models. We formulate this testing problem by introducing a notion of separation distance between general pairwise comparison models and the class of $\\mathcal{T}_F$ models. We then derive upper and lower bounds on the critical threshold for testing that depend on the topology of the observation graph. For the special case of complete observation graphs, this threshold scales as $\u0398((nk)^{-1/2})$, where $n$ is the number of agents and $k$ is the number of comparisons per pair. Furthermore, we propose a hypothesis test based on our separation distance, construct confidence intervals, establish time-uniform bounds on the probabilities of type I and II errors using reverse martingale techniques, and derive minimax lower bounds using information-theoretic methods. Finally, we validate our results through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc30d\ub300 \ube44\uad50 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00

Rigorous quality control is also critical but tedious, ensuring that the final report meets clinical standards. Existing automated approaches, including radiology report generation methods and medical vision-language models, focus mainly on the report generation phase and neglect the crucial quality control procedure, limiting their capability to provide comprehensive support to radiologists. We propose Radiologist Copilot, an agentic AI assistant equipped with orchestrated tools designed for automated radiology reporting with quality control. Leveraging large language models as the reasoning backbone, the agentic system autonomously selects tools, plans, and executes actions, emulating the behavior of radiologists throughout the holistic radiology reporting process. The orchestrated tools include region localization, think with image paradigm directed region analysis planning, strategic template selection for report generation, quality assessment and feedback-driven adaptive refinement for quality control. Therefore, Radiologist Copilot facilitates accurate, complete, and efficient radiology reporting, assisting radiologists and improving clinical efficiency.

We study inference-time compute (ITC) for evaluators that generate n independent thinking-rating samples per item, and propose a principled, distribution-calibrated aggregation scheme. Our method models three-way preferences with a Bradley-Terry-Davidson formulation on rating counts, leveraging both polarity (margin among non-ties) and decisiveness (non-tie rate) to distinguish narrow margins from strong consensus. Across various evaluation benchmarks, our approach consistently reduces MAE and increases pairwise accuracy versus standard baselines, and when evaluated against human-consensus meta-labels, matches or exceeds individual human raters.

However, emerging evidence suggests that iterative reasoning may foster belief entrenchment and confirmation bias, rather than enhancing truth-seeking behavior. In this study, we propose a systematic evaluation framework for belief entrenchment in LLM reasoning by leveraging the Martingale property from Bayesian statistics. This property implies that, under rational belief updating, the expected value of future beliefs should remain equal to the current belief, i.e., belief updates are unpredictable from the current belief. We propose the unsupervised, regression-based Martingale Score to measure violations of this property, which signal deviation from the Bayesian ability of updating on new evidence. In open-ended problem domains including event forecasting, value-laden questions, and academic paper review, we find such violations to be widespread across models and setups, where the current belief positively predicts future belief updates, a phenomenon which we term belief entrenchment. We identify the models, reasoning techniques, and domains more prone to belief entrenchment. Finally, we validate the Martingale Score by showing that it predicts ground-truth accuracy on problem domains where ground truth labels are available.

As LLMs increasingly mediate online communication, their potential to foster empathy and constructive dialogue becomes an important frontier for responsible AI research. This work explores whether LLMs can serve not only as moderators that detect harmful content, but as mediators capable of understanding and de-escalating online conflicts. Our framework decomposes mediation into two subtasks: judgment, where an LLM evaluates the fairness and emotional dynamics of a conversation, and steering, where it generates empathetic, de-escalatory messages to guide participants toward resolution. To assess mediation quality, we construct a large Reddit-based dataset and propose a multi-stage evaluation pipeline combining principle-based scoring, user simulation, and human comparison. Experiments show that API-based models outperform open-source counterparts in both reasoning and intervention alignment when doing mediation. Our findings highlight both the promise and limitations of current LLMs as emerging agents for online social mediation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ucf00\uc774\uc158 \uc911\uc7ac\uc5d0\uc11c \uacf5\uac10\uacfc \uac74\uc124\uc801\uc778 \ub300\ud654\ub97c \ucd09\uc9c4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \uc5f0\uad6c.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \ube60\ub978 \ubc1c\uc804\uc774 AI\uc758 \uae0d\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc751\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc5f4\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.
