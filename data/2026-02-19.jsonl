This design improves performance on long-horizon tasks but creates a security risk: untrusted external content observed during a benign session can be stored as memory and later treated as instruction. We study this risk and formalize a persistent attack we call a Zombie Agent, where an attacker covertly implants a payload that survives across sessions, effectively turning the agent into a puppet of the attacker.\n  We present a black-box attack framework that uses only indirect exposure through attacker-controlled web content. The attack has two phases. During infection, the agent reads a poisoned source while completing a benign task and writes the payload into long-term memory through its normal update process. During trigger, the payload is retrieved or carried forward and causes unauthorized tool behavior. We design mechanism-specific persistence strategies for common memory implementations, including sliding-window and retrieval-augmented memory, to resist truncation and relevance filtering. We evaluate the attack on representative agent setups and tasks, measuring both persistence over time and the ability to induce unauthorized actions while preserving benign task quality. Our results show that memory evolution can convert one-time indirect injection into persistent compromise, which suggests that defenses focused only on per-session prompt filtering are not sufficient for self-evolving agents."}

We ground how agents cooperate through a Distributed Constraint Optimization Problem (DCOP) and measure collusion via regret relative to the cooperative optimum. Colosseum tests each LLM for collusion under different objectives, persuasion tactics, and network topologies.

Despite its privacy-preserving benefits, FL has significant drawbacks, including slow convergence, high communication cost, and non-independent-and-identically-distributed (non-IID) data. In this work, we present a novel FedAvg variation called Fractional-Order Federated Averaging (FOFedAvg), which incorporates Fractional-Order Stochastic Gradient Descent (FOSGD) to capture long-range relationships and deeper historical information. By introducing memory-aware fractional-order updates, FOFedAvg improves communication efficiency and accelerates convergence while mitigating instability caused by heterogeneous, non-IID client data. We compare FOFedAvg against a broad set of established federated optimization algorithms on benchmark datasets including MNIST, FEMNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, EMNIST, the Cleveland heart disease dataset, Sent140, PneumoniaMNIST, and Edge-IIoTset. Across a range of non-IID partitioning schemes, FOFedAvg is competitive with, and often outperforms, these baselines in terms of test performance and convergence speed. On the theoretical side, we prove that FOFedAvg converges to a stationary point under standard smoothness and bounded-variance assumptions for fractional order $0<α\\le 1$. Together, these results show that fractional-order, memory-aware updates can substantially improve the robustness and effectiveness of federated learning, offering a practical path toward distributed training on heterogeneous data."}

From each paper's repository, we preserve the datasets, evaluation harness, and baseline implementations but withhold the paper's proposed method. This results in five containerized task environments comprising 39 sub-tasks in total. Within each environment, agents must propose novel hypotheses, run experiments, and attempt to surpass strong human baselines on the paper's metrics. In a controlled evaluation of an agent powered by GPT-5, we observe a sharp capability--reliability gap. The agent improves over the provided baselines from the repository in just 1 of 15 evaluations (6.7%) by 11.5%, and completes only 26.5% of sub-tasks on average. We identify recurring long-horizon failure modes, including impatience, poor time and resource management, overconfidence in weak hypotheses, difficulty coordinating parallel experiments, and hard limits from context length. Yet in a single run, the agent surpasses the solution of an ICML 2025 Spotlight task, indicating that frontier agents can occasionally reach state-of-the-art performance, but do so unreliably.

In Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning, these problems are often addressed by incorporating intrinsic drives that encourage prosocial or fair behavior. However, most existing methods assume that agents face identical incentives in the dilemma and require continuous access to global information about other agents to assess fairness. In this work, we introduce asymmetric variants of well-known SSD environments and examine how natural differences between agents influence cooperation dynamics. Our findings reveal that existing fairness-based methods struggle to adapt under asymmetric conditions by enforcing raw equality that wrongfully incentivize defection. To address this, we propose three modifications: (i) redefining fairness by accounting for agents' reward ranges, (ii) introducing an agent-based weighting mechanism to better handle inherent asymmetries, and (iii) localizing social feedback to make the methods effective under partial observability without requiring global information sharing. Experimental results show that in asymmetric scenarios, our method fosters faster emergence of cooperative policies compared to existing approaches, without sacrificing scalability or practicality."}

A Contrast in Risky Choices Between Reasoning and Conversational LLMs", "comment": null, "summary": "The use of large language models either as decision support systems, or in agentic workflows, is rapidly transforming the digital ecosystem. However, the understanding of LLM decision-making under uncertainty remains limited. We initiate a comparative study of LLM risky choices along two dimensions: (1) prospect representation (explicit vs. experience based) and (2) decision rationale (explanation). Our study, which involves 20 frontier and open LLMs, is complemented by a matched human subjects experiment, which provides one reference point, while an expected payoff maximizing rational agent model provides another. We find that LLMs cluster into two categories: reasoning models (RMs) and conversational models (CMs). RMs tend towards rational behavior, are insensitive to the order of prospects, gain/loss framing, and explanations, and behave similarly whether prospects are explicit or presented via experience history. CMs are significantly less rational, slightly more human-like, sensitive to prospect ordering, framing, and explanation, and exhibit a large description-history gap. Paired comparisons of open LLMs suggest that a key factor differentiating RMs and CMs is training for mathematical reasoning."}

We also perform sensor-level probing via mask-as-missing zeroing with per-channel influence estimation to support root-cause analysis. We evaluate 14 representative models on five public anomaly datasets (SWaT, WADI, SMD, SKAB, TEP) and two industrial datasets (steam turbine, nuclear turbogenerator) using unified splits and event aggregation. There is no universal winner: graph-structured models transfer best under dropout and long events (e.g., on SWaT under additive noise F1 drops 0.804->0.677 for a graph autoencoder, 0.759->0.680 for a graph-attention variant, and 0.762->0.756 for a hybrid graph attention model); density/flow models work well on clean stationary plants but can be fragile to monotone drift; spectral CNNs lead when periodicity is strong; reconstruction autoencoders become competitive after basic sensor vetting; predictive/hybrid dynamics help when faults break temporal dependencies but remain window-sensitive. The protocol also informs design choices: on SWaT under log drift, replacing normalizing flows with Gaussian density reduces high-stress F1 from ~0.75 to ~0.57, and fixing a learned DAG gives a small clean-set gain (~0.5-1.0 points) but increases drift sensitivity by ~8x."}

Specifically, the supervisor AI agent can dynamically assign other AI agents to participate in cooperative reasoning, while the unselected AI agents act as friendly jammers to degrade the eavesdropper's interception performance. To extend the service duration of AI agents, an energy minimization problem is formulated that jointly optimizes AI agent selection, base station (BS) beamforming, and AI agent transmission power, subject to latency and reasoning accuracy constraints. To address the formulated problem, we propose two resource allocation schemes, ASC and LAW, which first decompose it into three sub-problems. Specifically, ASC optimizes each sub-problem iteratively using the proposed alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based algorithm, semi-definite relaxation (SDR), and successive convex approximation (SCA), while LAW tackles each sub-problem using the proposed large language model (LLM) optimizer within an agentic workflow. The experimental results show that the proposed solutions can reduce network energy consumption by up to 59.1% compared to other benchmark schemes.

Current methods face two major limitations. First, many rely on a single dataset or follow a sequential data fusion and generation process, which means they fail to capture the complex interplay between features. Second, these approaches struggle with sampling zeros (valid but unobserved attribute combinations) and structural zeros (infeasible combinations due to logical constraints), which reduce the diversity and feasibility of the generated data. This study proposes a novel method to simultaneously integrate and synthesize multi-source datasets using a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) with gradient penalty. This joint learning method improves both the diversity and feasibility of synthetic data by defining a regularization term (inverse gradient penalty) for the generator loss function. For the evaluation, we implement a unified evaluation metric for similarity, and place special emphasis on measuring diversity and feasibility through recall, precision, and the F1 score. Results show that the proposed joint approach outperforms the sequential baseline, with recall increasing by 7\\% and precision by 15\\%. Additionally, the regularization term further improves diversity and feasibility, reflected in a 10\\% increase in recall and 1\\% in precision. We assess similarity distributions using a five-metric score. The joint approach performs better overall, and reaches a score of 88.1 compared to 84.6 for the sequential method. Since synthetic populations serve as a key input for ABM, this multi-source generative approach has the potential to significantly enhance the accuracy and reliability of ABM."}

However, practical implementations face two key limitations: error signals must still propagate from the output to early layers through multiple inference-phase steps, and feedback decays exponentially during this process, leading to vanishing updates in early layers. We propose direct Kolen-Pollack predictive coding (DKP-PC), which simultaneously addresses both feedback delay and exponential decay, yielding a more efficient and scalable variant of PC while preserving update locality. Leveraging direct feedback alignment and direct Kolen-Pollack algorithms, DKP-PC introduces learnable feedback connections from the output layer to all hidden layers, establishing a direct pathway for error transmission. This yields an algorithm that reduces the theoretical error propagation time complexity from O(L), with L being the network depth, to O(1), removing depth-dependent delay in error signals. Moreover, empirical results demonstrate that DKP-PC achieves performance at least comparable to, and often exceeding, that of standard PC, while offering improved latency and computational performance, supporting its potential for custom hardware-efficient implementations."}

In the simple foraging task we study, every day, our agent has to find its way from its home, through barriers, to food. Moreover, the world is non-stationary: from day to day, the location of the barriers and food may change, and the agent's sensing such as its location information is uncertain and very limited. Any model construction, such as a map, and use, such as planning, needs to be robust against these challenges, and if any learning is to be useful, it needs to be adequately fast. We look at a range of strategies, from simple to sophisticated, with various uses of memory and learning. We find that an architecture that can incorporate multiple strategies is required to handle (sub)tasks of a different nature, in particular for exploration and search, when food location is not known, and for planning a good path to a remembered (likely) food location. An agent that utilizes non-stationary probability learning techniques to keep updating its (episodic) memories and that uses those memories to build maps and plan on the fly (imperfect maps, i.e. noisy and limited to the agent's experience) can be increasingly and substantially more efficient than the simpler (minimal-memory) agents, as the task difficulties such as distance to goal are raised, as long as the uncertainty, from localization and change, is not too large."}

We demonstrate EAA at an imaging beamline at the Advanced Photon Source, including automated zone plate focusing, natural language-described feature search, and interactive data acquisition. These results illustrate how vision-capable agents can enhance beamline efficiency, reduce operational burden, and lower the expertise barrier for users."}

To alleviate this conflict, we propose an optimization-based unsupervised learning approach based on the wireless transformer (WiT) architecture that learns from channel state information (CSI) features. We reformulate the trade-off by combining the sum rate and fairness objectives through a Lagrangian multiplier, which is updated automatically via a dual-ascent algorithm. This mechanism allows for a controllable fairness constraint while simultaneously maximizing the sum rate, effectively realizing a trace on the Pareto front between two conflicting objectives. Our findings show that the proposed approach offers a flexible solution for managing the trade-off optimization under prescribed fairness."}

However, these models lack language-based reasoning and interactive capabilities, limiting their usefulness in real-world agronomic workflows. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) excel at interpreting and generating text, but cannot directly reason over high-dimensional, heterogeneous agricultural datasets. We bridge this gap with an agentic framework for agricultural science. It provides a Python execution environment, AgriWorld, exposing unified tools for geospatial queries over field parcels, remote-sensing time-series analytics, crop growth simulation, and task-specific predictors (e.g., yield, stress, and disease risk). On top of this environment, we design a multi-turn LLM agent, Agro-Reflective, that iteratively writes code, observes execution results, and refines its analysis via an execute-observe-refine loop. We introduce AgroBench, with scalable data generation for diverse agricultural QA spanning lookups, forecasting, anomaly detection, and counterfactual \"what-if\" analysis. Experiments outperform text-only and direct tool-use baselines, validating execution-driven reflection for reliable agricultural reasoning."}

In systems with a dominant attractor -- homeostatic physiology, nominal industrial operation, stable network traffic -- this creates a systematic \\emph{Stationarity Bias}: simple methods appear superior because the benchmark predominantly samples the easy, low-entropy regime where they trivially succeed. We formalize this bias and propose a \\emph{Stratified Stress-Test} that partitions evaluation into Stationary and Transient regimes. Using Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) as a testbed -- chosen for its rigorous ground-truth forcing functions (meals, insulin) that enable precise regime identification -- we establish three findings with broad implications:(i)~Stationary Efficiency: Linear interpolation achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction during stable intervals, confirming that complex architectures are computationally wasteful in low-entropy regimes.(ii)~Transient Fidelity: During critical transients (post-prandial peaks, hypoglycemic events), linear methods exhibit drastically degraded morphological fidelity (DTW), disproportionate to their RMSE -- a phenomenon we term the \\emph{RMSE Mirage}, where low pointwise error masks the destruction of signal shape.(iii)~Regime-Conditional Model Selection: Deep learning models preserve both pointwise accuracy and morphological integrity during transients, making them essential for safety-critical downstream tasks. We further derive empirical missingness distributions from clinical trials and impose them on complete training data, preventing models from exploiting unrealistically clean observations and encouraging robustness under real-world missingness. This framework generalizes to any regulated system where routine stationarity dominates critical transients."}

To address these challenges, we propose WAC, a web agent that integrates model collaboration, consequence simulation, and feedback-driven action refinement. To overcome the cognitive isolation of individual models, we introduce a multi-agent collaboration process that enables an action model to consult a world model as a web-environment expert for strategic guidance; the action model then grounds these suggestions into executable actions, leveraging prior knowledge of environmental state transition dynamics to enhance candidate action proposal. To achieve risk-aware resilient task execution, we introduce a two-stage deduction chain. A world model, specialized in environmental state transitions, simulates action outcomes, which a judge model then scrutinizes to trigger action corrective feedback when necessary. Experiments show that WAC achieves absolute gains of 1.8% on VisualWebArena and 1.3% on Online-Mind2Web."}

In the simple foraging task we study, every day, our agent has to find its way from its home, through barriers, to food. Moreover, the world is non-stationary: from day to day, the location of the barriers and food may change, and the agent's sensing such as its location information is uncertain and very limited. Any model construction, such as a map, and use, such as planning, needs to be robust against these challenges, and if any learning is to be useful, it needs to be adequately fast. We look at a range of strategies, from simple to sophisticated, with various uses of memory and learning. We find that an architecture that can incorporate multiple strategies is required to handle (sub)tasks of a different nature, in particular for exploration and search, when food location is not known, and for planning a good path to a remembered (likely) food location. An agent that utilizes non-stationary probability learning techniques to keep updating its (episodic) memories and that uses those memories to build maps and plan on the fly (imperfect maps, i.e. noisy and limited to the agent's experience) can be increasingly and substantially more efficient than the simpler (minimal-memory) agents, as the task difficulties such as distance to goal are raised, as long as the uncertainty, from localization and change, is not too large."}

By formulating the state inference process as a multi-modal diffusion process, GlobeDiff overcomes ambiguities in state estimation while simultaneously inferring the global state with high fidelity. We prove that the estimation error of GlobeDiff under both unimodal and multi-modal distributions can be bounded.

Conventional encoding methods (e.g., one-hot) often fail to convey the nuanced relationships among closely related subtypes, limiting AI's semantic comprehension. To address this limitation, this study proposes a novel training approach that employs large language model (LLM) embeddings (e.g., OpenAI GPT and Meta LLaMA) as encodings to preserve finer distinctions in building semantics. We evaluated the proposed method by training GraphSAGE models to classify 42 building object subtypes across five high-rise residential building information models (BIMs). Various embedding dimensions were tested, including original high-dimensional LLM embeddings (1,536, 3,072, or 4,096) and 1,024-dimensional compacted embeddings generated via the Matryoshka representation model. Experimental results demonstrated that LLM encodings outperformed the conventional one-hot baseline, with the llama-3 (compacted) embedding achieving a weighted average F1-score of 0.8766, compared to 0.8475 for one-hot encoding. The results underscore the promise of leveraging LLM-based encodings to enhance AI's ability to interpret complex, domain-specific building semantics. As the capabilities of LLMs and dimensionality reduction techniques continue to evolve, this approach holds considerable potential for broad application in semantic elaboration tasks throughout the AECO industry."}

We ground how agents cooperate through a Distributed Constraint Optimization Problem (DCOP) and measure collusion via regret relative to the cooperative optimum. Colosseum tests each LLM for collusion under different objectives, persuasion tactics, and network topologies. Through our audit, we show that most out-of-the-box models exhibited a propensity to collude when a secret communication channel was artificially formed.

However, despite significant progress, models remain vulnerable to simple in-distribution exploits, such as rewriting prompts in the past tense or translating them into other languages. We argue that this persistent fragility stems from a fundamental limitation in current adversarial training algorithms: they minimize adversarial loss on their training set but inadequately cover the data distribution, resulting in vulnerability to seemingly simple attacks. To bridge this gap, we propose Distributional Adversarial Training, DAT. We leverage Diffusion LLMs to approximate the true joint distribution of prompts and responses, enabling generation of diverse, high-likelihood samples that address generalization failures. By combining optimization over the data distribution provided by the diffusion model with continuous adversarial training, DAT achieves substantially higher adversarial robustness than previous methods."}

This design improves performance on long-horizon tasks but creates a security risk: untrusted external content observed during a benign session can be stored as memory and later treated as instruction. We study this risk and formalize a persistent attack we call a Zombie Agent, where an attacker covertly implants a payload that survives across sessions, effectively turning the agent into a puppet of the attacker.\n  We present a black-box attack framework that uses only indirect exposure through attacker-controlled web content. The attack has two phases. During infection, the agent reads a poisoned source while completing a benign task and writes the payload into long-term memory through its normal update process. During trigger, the payload is retrieved or carried forward and causes unauthorized tool behavior. We design mechanism-specific persistence strategies for common memory implementations, including sliding-window and retrieval-augmented memory, to resist truncation and relevance filtering. We evaluate the attack on representative agent setups and tasks, measuring both persistence over time and the ability to induce unauthorized actions while preserving benign task quality. Our results show that memory evolution can convert one-time indirect injection into persistent compromise, which suggests that defenses focused only on per-session prompt filtering are not sufficient for self-evolving agents."}
