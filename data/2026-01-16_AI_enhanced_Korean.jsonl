However, this physical dispersion constrains agents to limited local perception and finite temporal horizons. We characterize this bottleneck as spatiotemporal partial observability. Given such fragmented awareness, distributed agents struggle to coordinate efficiently. To bridge this gap, we introduce MACRO-LLM, LLM-empowered multi-agent collaborative reasoning under spatiotemporal partial observability. The architecture addresses spatiotemporal constraints via three modules: (1) the CoProposer mitigates temporal uncertainty by verifying candidate actions via predictive rollouts; (2) the Negotiator overcomes spatial myopia by resolving conflicts through mean-field statistical aggregation; and (3) the Introspector ensures continuous adaptation by analyzing historical experience to refine strategies via semantic gradient descent. Extensive evaluations on two complex long-horizon tasks, cooperative adaptive cruise control and pandemic control, demonstrate that our framework effectively mitigates spatiotemporal partial observability through spatial and temporal strategies, enabling robust coordination.", "AI": {"tldr": "MACRO-LLM\uc740 \uc2dc\uacf5\uac04\uc801 \ubd80\ubd84 \uad00\uce21 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud611\ub825 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud604\uc2e4 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \ubd84\uc0b0\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud611\ub825\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\ub294\ub2e4.", "method": "MACRO-LLM\uc740 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubaa8\ub4c8(\uc81c\uc548\uc790, \ud611\uc0c1\uc790, \ub0b4\uc801 \ud0d0\uad6c\uc790)\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2dc\uacf5\uac04\uc801 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud611\ub825\uc801 \uc21c\uc751\uacfc \ud32c\ub370\ubbf9 \uc81c\uc5b4\uc5d0\uc11c extensive evaluations\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc870\uc815\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "MACRO-LLM\uc740 \uc2dc\uacf5\uac04\uc801 \ubd80\ubd84 \uad00\uce21 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud604\uc2e4 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0 \ubc30\uce58\ub41c \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uacf5\uac04\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc0b0\ub41c \uac1c\uccb4\ub85c \uc791\ub3d9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \ubd84\uc0b0\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc9c0\uc5ed \uc778\uc2dd\uacfc \uc720\ud55c\ud55c \uc2dc\uac04 \uc9c0\ud3c9\uc120\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uc57d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \uc2dc\uacf5\uac04\uc801 \ubd80\ubd84 \uad00\uce21 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc9d3\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4._fragmented awareness\ub97c \uace0\ub824\ud560 \ub54c, \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uc18c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc2dc\uacf5\uac04\uc801 \ubd80\ubd84 \uad00\uce21 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c LLM\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud611\ub825 \ucd94\ub860\uc778 MACRO-LLM\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2dc\uacf5\uac04\uc801 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: (1) CoProposer\ub294 \uc608\uce21 \ub864\uc544\uc6c3\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud6c4\ubcf4 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc2dc\uac04 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4; (2) Negotiator\ub294 \ud3c9\uade0 \ud544\ub4dc \ud1b5\uacc4 \uc9d1\uacc4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ucda9\ub3cc\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uacf5\uac04\uc801 \ub2e8\uc548\uc744 \uadf9\ubcf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4; (3) Introspector\ub294 \uc804\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc815\uc81c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc5ec \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uc801\uc751\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud611\ub825\uc801\uc778 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ud06c\ub8e8\uc988 \ucee8\ud2b8\ub864\uacfc \ud32c\ub370\ubbf9 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub77c\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc7a5\uae30 \uacfc\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uacf5\uac04 \ubc0f \uc2dc\uac04 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2dc\uacf5\uac04\uc801 \ubd80\ubd84 \uad00\uce21 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc644\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Recent MAS routing methods aim to balance performance and overhead by dynamically selecting agent roles and language models. However, these approaches typically rely on a homogeneous collaboration mode, where all agents follow the same interaction pattern, limiting collaboration flexibility across different roles. Motivated by Social Capital Theory, which emphasizes that different roles benefit from distinct forms of collaboration, we propose SC-MAS, a framework for constructing heterogeneous and cost-efficient multi-agent systems. SC-MAS models MAS as directed graphs, where edges explicitly represent pairwise collaboration strategies, allowing different agent pairs to interact through tailored communication patterns. Given an input query, a unified controller progressively constructs an executable MAS by selecting task-relevant agent roles, assigning edge-level collaboration strategies, and allocating appropriate LLM backbones to individual agents. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of SC-MAS. In particular, SC-MAS improves accuracy by 3.35% on MMLU while reducing inference cost by 15.38%, and achieves a 3.53% accuracy gain with a 12.13% cost reduction on MBPP. These results validate the feasibility of SC-MAS and highlight the effectiveness of heterogeneous collaboration in multi-agent systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(SC-MAS)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc5ed\ud560 \ubc0f \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc120\ud0dd\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \ube44\uc6a9 \uac04\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ub9de\ucd98\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uc790\ubcf8 \uc774\ub860\uc5d0 \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc544 \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \uc5ed\ud560\uc774 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud615\ud0dc\uc758 \ud611\ub825 \ud61c\ud0dd\uc744 \ub204\ub9ac\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud568\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "SC-MAS\ub294 \ubc29\ud5a5 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub85c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(MAS)\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uace0, \uc5d0\uc9c0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc30d\ubc29 \ud611\ub825 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\uc5b4 \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc30d\uc774 \ub9de\ucda4\ud615 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "SC-MAS\ub294 MMLU\uc5d0\uc11c 3.35%\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uacfc 15.38%\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ube44\uc6a9 \uc808\uac10\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0, MBPP\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 3.53%\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uacfc 12.13%\uc758 \ube44\uc6a9 \uc808\uac10\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "SC-MAS\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ud611\ub825\uc758 \uc720\ud6a8\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uace0 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uae30\ubc18 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(MAS)\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04 \ud611\ub825\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \ub192\uc740 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc MAS \ub77c\uc6b0\ud305 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc5ed\ud560\uacfc \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\uc5ec \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uade0\ud615\ud654\ud558\ub824\uace0 \ud55c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ub530\ub974\ub294 \ub3d9\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ud611\ub825 \ubaa8\ub4dc\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uac8c \ub418\uc5b4, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560 \uac04\uc758 \ud611\ub825 \uc720\uc5f0\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \uc5ed\ud560\uc774 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud615\ud0dc\uc758 \ud611\ub825 \ud61c\ud0dd\uc744 \ub204\ub9b0\ub2e4\ub294 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uc790\ubcf8 \uc774\ub860\uc5d0 \ud798\uc785\uc5b4, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ube44\uc6a9 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 SC-MAS\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

We introduce ART, an Action-based Reasoning clinical Task benchmark for medical AI agents, which mines real-world EHR data to create challenging tasks targeting known reasoning weaknesses. Through analysis of existing benchmarks, we identify three dominant error categories: retrieval failures, aggregation errors, and conditional logic misjudgments. Our four-stage pipeline -- scenario identification, task generation, quality audit, and evaluation -- produces diverse, clinically validated tasks grounded in real patient data. Evaluating GPT-4o-mini and Claude 3.5 Sonnet on 600 tasks shows near-perfect retrieval after prompt refinement, but substantial gaps in aggregation (28--64%) and threshold reasoning (32--38%).

In contrast, when stylometry is employed as a tool for authorship verification--confirming whether a text truly originates from a claimed author--it can also be weaponized for malicious purposes. Techniques such as de-anonymization, re-identification, tracking, profiling, and downstream effects like censorship illustrate the privacy threats that stylometric analysis can enable. Building on these concerns, this paper further explores how adversarial stylometry combined with steganography can counteract stylometric analysis. We first present enhancements to our adversarial attack, $\\textit{TraceTarnish}$, providing stronger evidence of its capacity to confound stylometric systems and reduce their attribution and verification accuracy. Next, we examine how steganographic embedding can be fine-tuned to mask an author's stylistic fingerprint, quantifying the level of authorship obfuscation achievable as a function of the proportion of words altered with zero-width Unicode characters. Based on our findings, steganographic coverage of 33% or higher seemingly ensures authorship obfuscation. Finally, we reflect on the ways stylometry can be used to undermine privacy and argue for the necessity of defensive tools like $\\textit{TraceTarnish}$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740

Communication overhead is a central issue in SFL and can be mitigated with auxiliary networks. Yet, the fundamental client-side computation challenge remains, as back-propagation requires substantial memory and computation costs, severely limiting the scale of models that edge devices can support. To enable more resource-efficient client computation and reduce the client-server communication, we propose HERON-SFL, a novel hybrid optimization framework that integrates zeroth-order (ZO) optimization for local client training while retaining first-order (FO) optimization on the server. With the assistance of auxiliary networks, ZO updates enable clients to approximate local gradients using perturbed forward-only evaluations per step, eliminating memory-intensive activation caching and avoiding explicit gradient computation in the traditional training process. Leveraging the low effective rank assumption, we theoretically prove that HERON-SFL's convergence rate is independent of model dimensionality, addressing a key scalability concern common to ZO algorithms. Empirically, on ResNet training and language model (LM) fine-tuning tasks, HERON-SFL matches benchmark accuracy while reducing client peak memory by up to 64% and client-side compute cost by up to 33% per step, substantially expanding the range of models that can be trained or adapted on resource-limited devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "HERON-SFL\ub294 \uc790\uc6d0 \uc81c\uc57d\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\uc640 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc11c\ubc84 \uac04 \ud611\ub825 \uad50\uc721\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "Split Federated Learning(SFL)\uc740 \uc790\uc6d0 \uc81c\uc57d\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uc5e3\uc9c0 \uc7a5\uce58\uc640 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc774 \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \uc11c\ubc84 \uac04\uc758 \ud611\uc5c5 \uad50\uc721\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uce21\uc758 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "HERON-SFL\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\ub85c\uc11c \uc21c\uc11c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uace0 \uc11c\ubc84\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 1\ucc28 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "HERON-SFL\uc740 ResNet \uad50\uc721\uacfc \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc5d0 \ub3c4\ub2ec\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \ud53c\ud06c \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\ub97c \ucd5c\ub300 64%, \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uce21 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \ucd5c\ub300 33% \uc904\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "HERON-SFL\uc740 \uc790\uc6d0\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc7a5\uce58\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc801\uc751\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ubc94\uc704\ub97c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \ud655\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "Split Federated Learning(SFL)\uc740 \uc790\uc6d0 \uc81c\uc57d\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uc5e3\uc9c0 \uc7a5\uce58\uc640 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc774 \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \uc11c\ubc84 \uac04\uc758 \ud611\uc5c5 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.

We present an empirical study evaluating frontier AI models on 150 workplace tasks within a realistic e-commerce RL environment from Surge. Our analysis reveals an empirically-derived \\emph{hierarchy of agentic capabilities} that models must master for real-world deployment: (1) tool use, (2) planning and goal formation, (3) adaptability, (4) groundedness, and (5) common-sense reasoning. Even the best-performing models fail approximately 40\\% of the tasks, with failures clustering predictably along this hierarchy. Weaker models struggle with fundamental tool use and planning, whereas stronger models primarily fail on tasks requiring contextual inference beyond explicit instructions. We introduce a task-centric design methodology for RL environments that emphasizes diversity and domain expert contributions, provide detailed failure analysis, and discuss implications for agent development. Our findings suggest that while current frontier models can demonstrate coherent multi-step behavior, substantial capability gaps remain before achieving human-level task completion in realistic

Despite recent advances in large language models (LLMs), existing LLM-based agents remain ineffective on high-difficulty cryptographic CTF challenges, which require precise cryptanalytic knowledge, stable long-horizon reasoning, and disciplined interaction with specialized toolchains. Through a systematic exploratory study, we show that insufficient knowledge granularity, rather than model reasoning capacity, is a primary factor limiting successful cryptographic exploitation: coarse or abstracted external knowledge often fails to support correct attack modeling and implementation. Motivated by this observation, we propose KryptoPilot, an open-world knowledge-augmented LLM agent for automated cryptographic exploitation. KryptoPilot integrates dynamic open-world knowledge acquisition via a Deep Research pipeline, a persistent workspace for structured knowledge reuse, and a governance subsystem that stabilizes reasoning through behavioral constraints and cost-aware model routing. This design enables precise knowledge alignment while maintaining efficient reasoning across heterogeneous subtasks. We evaluate KryptoPilot on two established CTF benchmarks and in six real-world CTF competitions. KryptoPilot achieves a complete solve rate on InterCode-CTF, solves between 56 and 60 percent of cryptographic challenges on the NYU-CTF benchmark, and successfully solves 26 out of 33 cryptographic challenges in live competitions, including multiple earliest-solved and uniquely-solved instances. These results demonstrate the necessity of open-world, fine-grained knowledge augmentation and governed reasoning for scaling LLM-based agents to real-world cryptographic exploitation.", "AI": {"tldr": "KryptoPilot\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9 \uc554\ud638\ud559\uc801 \uc545\uc6a9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc99d\uac15 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c, CTF \ub300\ud68c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub192\uc740 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70 \uc2e4\uc138\uacc4 \uc554\ud638\ud559\uc801 \ub3c4\uc804\uc5d0 \uc801\ud569\ud558\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uace0\ub09c\uc774\ub3c4 \uc554\ud638\ud559 CTF \ub3c4\uc804\uc5d0\uc11c \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc774\uc720\ub294 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc758 \uc138\ubd84\ud654 \ubd80\uc871\uc5d0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "KryptoPilot\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc624\ud508 \uc6d4\ub4dc \uc9c0\uc2dd \ud68d\ub4dd, \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uc791\uc5c5\uacf5\uac04 \ubc0f \ud589\ub3d9 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4 \ud558\uc704 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "KryptoPilot\ub294 InterCode-CTF\uc5d0\uc11c \uc644\uc804 \ud574\uacb0 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0, NYU-CTF \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c 56~60%\uc758 \uc554\ud638\ud559\uc801 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud588\uc73c\uba70, \ub77c\uc774\ube0c \ub300\ud68c\uc5d0\uc11c 33\uac1c\uc758 \uc554\ud638\ud559\uc801 \ubb38\uc81c \uc911 26\uac1c\ub97c \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uacb0\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "KryptoPilot\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc624\ud508 \uc6d4\ub4dc \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc138\ubd84\ud654\ub41c \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc99d\uac15\uacfc \uad00\ub9ac\ub41c \ucd94\ub860\uc774 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc2e4\uc138\uacc4\uc758 \uc554\ud638\ud559\uc801 \uc545\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\ub300\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "Capture-the-Flag (CTF) \ub300\ud68c\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \ud30c\uc0dd\ub41c \uacf5\uaca9 \ubc0f \ubc29\uc5b4 \uae30\uc220\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0 \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\ub294 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc73c\ub85c \ud604\ub300 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc2ec\uc801\uc778 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud55c\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \uae30\uc874 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc554\ud638 \ubd84\uc11d \uc9c0\uc2dd, \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc7a5\uae30 \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \uc804\ubb38 \ub3c4\uad6c \uccb4\uacc4\uc640\uc758 \uaddc\ubc94\uc801\uc778 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \uace0\ub09c\uc774\ub3c4 \uc554\ud638\ud559 CTF \ub3c4\uc804\uc5d0\uc11c \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc778 \uc554\ud638\ud559\uc801 \ucc29\ucde8\ub97c \uc81c\ud55c\ud558\ub294 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc694\uc778\uc774 \ubaa8\ub378 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \uc544\ub2cc \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc758 \ubd88\ucda9\ubd84\ud55c \uc138\ubd84\ud654\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4: \uac70\uce60\uac70\ub098 \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654\ub41c \uc678\ubd80 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uc62c\ubc14\ub978 \uacf5\uaca9 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \ubc0f \uad6c\ud604\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uad00\ucc30\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9 \uc554\ud638\ud559\uc801 \ucc29\ucde8\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc99d\uac15 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 KryptoPilot\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

Corresponding author: Yan Lin", "summary": "Detecting evasive answers in earnings calls is critical for financial transparency, yet progress is hindered by the lack of large-scale benchmarks. We introduce EvasionBench, comprising 30,000 training samples and 1,000 human-annotated test samples (Cohen's Kappa 0.835) across three evasion levels. Our key contribution is a multi-model annotation framework leveraging a core insight: disagreement between frontier LLMs signals hard examples most valuable for training. We mine boundary cases where two strong annotators conflict, using a judge to resolve labels. This approach outperforms single-model distillation by 2.4 percent, with judge-resolved samples improving generalization despite higher training loss (0.421 vs 0.393) - evidence that disagreement mining acts as implicit regularization.

This process refines the often small but critical details of the model building process, such as which features/patients to include and how clinical categories should be defined. However, this traditional collaboration process is extremely time- and resource-intensive, resulting in only a small fraction of CPMs reaching clinical practice. This challenge intensifies when teams attempt to incorporate unstructured clinical notes, which can contain an enormous number of concepts. To address this challenge, we introduce HACHI, an iterative human-in-the-loop framework that uses AI agents to accelerate the development of fully interpretable CPMs by enabling the exploration of concepts in clinical notes. HACHI alternates between (i) an AI agent rapidly exploring and evaluating candidate concepts in clinical notes and (ii) clinical and domain experts providing feedback to improve the CPM learning process. HACHI defines concepts as simple yes-no questions that are used in linear models, allowing the clinical AI team to transparently review, refine, and validate the CPM learned in each round. In two real-world prediction tasks (acute kidney injury and traumatic brain injury), HACHI outperforms existing approaches, surfaces new clinically relevant concepts not included in commonly-used CPMs, and improves model generalizability across clinical sites and time periods. Furthermore, HACHI reveals the critical role of the clinical AI team, such as directing the AI agent to explore concepts that it had not previously considered, adjusting the granularity of concepts it considers, changing the objective function to better align with the clinical objectives, and identifying issues of data bias and leakage.", "AI": {"tldr": "HACHI\ub294 \uc784\uc0c1 \uc608\uce21 \ubaa8\ub378(CPM)\uc758 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \uc778\uac04-\ub8e8\ud504 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc548\uc804\ud558\uace0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\uba70 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uc784\uc0c1 \uc608\uce21 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\ub294 \uacfc\uc815\uc740 \uc2dc\uac04\uacfc \uc790\uc6d0\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \uc18c\uc694\ub418\uc5b4 \uc784\uc0c1\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc801\ub2e4.", "method": "HACHI\ub294 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc784\uc0c1 \ub178\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\uace0 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uacfc\uc815\uacfc \uc784\uc0c1 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\ub4e4\uc774 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc5ec CPM \ud559\uc2b5 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ubc88\uac08\uc544 \uc9c4\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "HACHI\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 CPM\uc5d0 \ud3ec\ud568\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc784\uc0c1\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad00\ub828 \uc788\ub294 \uac1c\ub150\ub3c4 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "HACHI\ub294 \uc784\uc0c1 AI \ud300\uc758 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ubc1d\ud600\ub0b4\uace0, AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uace0\ub824\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\ub358 \uac1c\ub150 \ud0d0\uc0c9, \uac1c\ub150\uc758 \uc138\ubd84\ud654 \uc870\uc808, \ubaa9\ud45c \ud568\uc218 \ubcc0\uacbd \ubc0f \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud3b8\ud5a5 \ubc0f \ub204\ucd9c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uae30\uc5ec\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc548\uc804\ud558\uace0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\uba70 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uc784\uc0c1 \uc608\uce21 \ubaa8\ub378(CPM)\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc784\uc0c1 \uc804\ubb38\uac00, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uacfc\ud559\uc790 \ubc0f \uc815\ubcf4 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uac04\uc758 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \ud611\ub825\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \uc774 \uacfc\uc815\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378 \uad6c\ucd95 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\uc758 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc138\ubd80\uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \ub298\ub9ac\uba70, \uc5b4\ub5a4 \ud2b9\uc131/\ud658\uc790\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud560\uc9c0 \ubc0f \uc784\uc0c1 \ubc94\uc8fc\ub97c \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc815\uc758\ud560\uc9c0\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8ec\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ud611\ub825 \uacfc\uc815\uc740 \uadf9\ud788 \uc2dc\uac04\uacfc \uc790\uc6d0\uc774 \uc18c\ubaa8\ub418\uc5b4 \uacb0\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc18c\uc218\uc758 CPM\ub9cc\uc774 \uc784\uc0c1\uc5d0 \ub3c4\ub2ec\ud558\uac8c \ub41c\ub2e4. \ud300\uc774 \ube44\uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc784\uc0c1 \ub178\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub824\uace0 \ud560 \ub54c \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \ub354\uc6b1 \uc2ec\ud654\ub41c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc784\uc0c1 \ub178\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uac1c\ub150 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc644\uc804\ud788 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c CPM\uc758 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \uc778\uac04-\ub8e8\ud504 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 HACHI\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.

This ability can be applied to support intelligent decision-making across diverse fields, such as financial forecasting and preventive healthcare. However, directly prompting LLMs for probability estimation faces significant challenges: their outputs are often noisy, and the underlying predicting process is opaque. In this paper, we propose PRISM: Probability Reconstruction via Shapley Measures, a framework that brings transparency and precision to LLM-based probability estimation. PRISM decomposes an LLM's prediction by quantifying the marginal contribution of each input factor using Shapley values. These factor-level contributions are then aggregated to reconstruct a calibrated final estimate. In our experiments, we demonstrate PRISM improves predictive accuracy over direct prompting and other baselines, across multiple domains including finance, healthcare, and agriculture. Beyond performance, PRISM provides a transparent prediction pipeline: our case studies visualize how individual factors shape the final estimate, helping build trust in LLM-based decision support systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ud655\ub960 \ucd94\uc815\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c PRISM \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud55c \uc0ac\uac74\uc758 \ud655\ub960\uc744 \ucd94\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "method": "PRISM\uc740 Shapley \uac12\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac01 \uc785\ub825 \uc694\uc18c\uc758 \ud3c9\uade0 \uae30\uc5ec\ub97c \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\uc5ec LLM\uc758 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \ubd84\ud574\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc PRISM\uc774 \uae08\uc735, \uc758\ub8cc \ubc0f \ub18d\uc5c5 \ub4f1 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ubc0f \ub2e4\ub978 \uae30\uc900\uc120\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "PRISM\uc740 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \uc9c0\uc6d0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\ub294 \ud22c\uba85\ud55c \uc608\uce21 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc9c0\uc2dd\uacfc \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud55c \uc0ac\uac74\uc758 \ud655\ub960\uc744 \ucd94\uc815\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub2a5\ub825\uc740 \uae08\uc735 \uc608\uce21 \ubc0f \uc608\ubc29 \uc758\ub8cc\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc801\uc778 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc801\uc6a9\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 LLM\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud655\ub960 \ucd94\uc815 \uc694\uccad\uc740 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uadf8\ub4e4\uc758 \ucd9c\ub825\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \ub178\uc774\uc988\uac00 \ub9ce\uace0, \uae30\ubcf8 \uc608\uce21 \uacfc\uc815\uc740 \ubd88\ud22c\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 PRISM: Shapley \uce21\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \ud655\ub960 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ud655\ub960 \ucd94\uc815\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud22c\uba85\uc131\uacfc \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Yet conventional Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions in aviation remain siloed and narrow, focusing on isolated tasks or single modalities. They struggle to integrate heterogeneous data such as voice communications, radar tracks, sensor streams and textual reports, which limits situational awareness, adaptability, and real-time decision support. This paper introduces the vision of AviationLMM, a Large Multimodal foundation Model for civil aviation, designed to unify the heterogeneous data streams of civil aviation and enable understanding, reasoning, generation and agentic applications. We firstly identify the gaps between existing AI solutions and requirements. Secondly, we describe the model architecture that ingests multimodal inputs such as air-ground voice, surveillance, on-board telemetry, video and structured texts, and performs cross-modal alignment and fusion, and produces flexible outputs ranging from situation summaries and risk alerts to predictive diagnostics and multimodal incident reconstructions. In order to fully realize this vision, we identify key research opportunities to address, including data acquisition, alignment and fusion, pretraining, reasoning, trustworthiness, privacy, robustness to missing modalities, and synthetic scenario generation. By articulating the design and challenges of AviationLMM, we aim to boost the civil aviation foundation model progress and catalyze coordinated research efforts toward an integrated, trustworthy and

The dominant framing of these threats as \"prompt injection\" -- a catch-all phrase for security failures in LLM-based systems -- obscures a more complex reality: Attacks on LLM-based systems increasingly involve multi-step sequences that mirror traditional malware campaigns. In this paper, we propose that attacks targeting LLM-based applications constitute a distinct class of malware, which we term \\textit{promptware}, and introduce a five-step kill chain model for analyzing these threats. The framework comprises Initial Access (prompt injection), Privilege Escalation (jailbreaking), Persistence (memory and retrieval poisoning), Lateral Movement (cross-system and cross-user propagation), and Actions on Objective (ranging from data exfiltration to unauthorized transactions). By mapping recent attacks to this structure, we demonstrate that LLM-related attacks follow systematic sequences analogous to traditional malware campaigns. The promptware kill chain offers security practitioners a structured methodology for threat modeling and provides a common vocabulary for researchers across AI safety and cybersecurity to address a rapidly evolving threat landscape.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacf5\uaca9\uc774 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ub9ec\uc6e8\uc5b4 \ucea0\ud398\uc778\uacfc \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc778 '\ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4'\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc2e0\uc18d\ud55c \ucc44\ud0dd\uc740 \uae30\uc874 \ubcf4\uc548 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 \uc801\uc808\ud788 \ub300\uc751\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacf5\uaca9 \ud45c\uba74\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc744 \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \uacf5\uaca9\uc774 '\ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4'\ub77c\ub294 \ubcc4\ub3c4\uc758 \ub9ec\uc6e8\uc5b4 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4\uc5d0 \ud574\ub2f9\ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub2e4\uc12f \ub2e8\uacc4\uc758 \ud0ac \uccb4\uc778 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ucd5c\uc2e0 \uacf5\uaca9\ub4e4\uc744 \uc774 \uad6c\uc870\uc5d0 \ub9e4\ud551\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 LLM \uad00\ub828 \uacf5\uaca9\uc774 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ub9ec\uc6e8\uc5b4 \ucea0\ud398\uc778\uacfc \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\ub97c \ub530\ub978\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \ud0ac \uccb4\uc778\uc740 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc2e4\ubb34\uc790\uc5d0\uac8c \uc704\ud611 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0, AI \uc548\uc804 \ubc0f \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc790\ub4e4 \uac04\uc758 \uacf5\ud1b5 \uc5b4\ud718\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uae30\ubc18 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc2e0\uc18d\ud55c \ucc44\ud0dd -- \ucc57\ubd07\uc5d0\uc11c \ucf54\ub4dc \ubc0f \uae08\uc735 \uac70\ub798\ub97c \uc2e4\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \uc774\ub974\uae30\uae4c\uc9c0 -- \ub294 \uae30\uc874 \ubcf4\uc548 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 \uc81c\ub300\ub85c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacf5\uaca9 \ud45c\uba74\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc704\ud611\uc744 '\ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc8fc\uc785'\uc73c\ub85c \uaddc\uba85\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc2e4\ud328\ub97c \ud3ec\uad04\ud558\ub294 \ub300\uba85\uc0ac\ub85c \uc81c\uc2dc\ub418\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubcf4\ub2e4 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud604\uc2e4\uc744 \uc228\uae30\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.

While ACS2 is highly effective at building cognitive maps through latent learning, its performance often stagnates in environments characterized by sparse rewards. We propose a specific architectural variant that triggers hindsight learning when the agent fails to reach its primary goal, re-labeling visited states as virtual goals to densify the learning signal. The proposed model was evaluated on two benchmarks: the deterministic \\texttt{Maze 6} and the stochastic \\texttt{FrozenLake}.

This survey presents a comprehensive and structured synthesis of memory in LLMs and MLLMs, organizing the literature into a cohesive taxonomy comprising implicit, explicit, and agentic memory paradigms. Specifically, the survey delineates three primary memory frameworks. Implicit memory refers to the knowledge embedded within the internal parameters of pre-trained transformers, encompassing their capacity for memorization, associative retrieval, and contextual reasoning. Recent work has explored methods to interpret, manipulate, and reconfigure this latent memory. Explicit memory involves external storage and retrieval components designed to augment model outputs with dynamic, queryable knowledge representations, such as textual corpora, dense vectors, and graph-based structures, thereby enabling scalable and updatable interaction with information sources. Agentic memory introduces persistent, temporally extended memory structures within autonomous agents, facilitating long-term planning, self-consistency, and collaborative behavior in multi-agent systems, with relevance to embodied and interactive AI. Extending beyond text, the survey examines the integration of memory within multi-modal settings, where coherence across vision, language, audio, and action modalities is essential. Key architectural advances, benchmark tasks, and open challenges are discussed, including issues related to memory capacity, alignment, factual consistency, and cross-system interoperability.", "AI":

Improvements in solving this problem can greatly benefit the clinical value of optoacoustic imaging. Existing variational inversion methods require an accurate and differentiable model of this light transport. As neural surrogate models allow fast and differentiable simulations of complex physical processes, they are considered promising candidates to be used in solving such inverse problems. However, there are in general no guarantees that the derivatives of these surrogate models accurately match those of the underlying physical operator. As accurate derivatives are central to solving inverse problems, errors in the model derivative can considerably hinder high fidelity reconstructions. To overcome this limitation, we present a surrogate model for light transport in tissue that uses Sobolev training to improve the accuracy of the model derivatives. Additionally, the form of Sobolev training we used is suitable for high-dimensional models in general. Our results demonstrate that Sobolev training for a light transport surrogate model not only improves derivative accuracy but also reduces generalization error for in-distribution and out-of-distribution samples. These improvements promise to considerably enhance the utility of the surrogate model in downstream tasks, especially in solving inverse problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uad11\ud559\uc74c\ud5a5 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9d5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc870\uc9c1\uc758 \ud761\uc218 \uacc4\uc218\ub97c \ubcf5\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc778 \ubb38\uc81c\uc774\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378 \ub3c4\ud568\uc218\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574 Sobolev \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub300\ub9ac \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ud30c\uc0dd\ubb3c\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \uc904\uc5ec \uc5ed \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0\uc5d0 \uc720\uc6a9\ud558\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uad11\ud559\uc74c\ud5a5 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9d5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc870\uc9c1\uc758 \ud761\uc218 \uacc4\uc218\ub97c \ubcf5\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc774\uc810\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc870\uc9c1 \ub0b4\uc758 \ube5b \uc804\ub2ec\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub300\ub9ac \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uace0, \ubaa8\ub378 \ub3c4\ud568\uc218\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 Sobolev \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "Sobolev \ud6c8\ub828\uc774 \ub300\ub9ac \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ub3c4\ud568\uc218 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0, \ubd84\ud3ec \ub0b4 \ubc0f \ubd84\ud3ec \uc678 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \uc904\uc774\ub294 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub300\ub9ac \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc720\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uad11\ud559\uc74c\ud5a5 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9d5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc870\uc9c1\uc758 \ud761\uc218 \uacc4\uc218\ub97c \ubcf5\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ube5b \uc804\ub2ec\uc744 \uc5ed\uc804\ud658\ud558\ub294 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \uac1c\uc120\uc740 \uad11\ud559\uc74c\ud5a5 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9d5\uc758 \uc784\uc0c1\uc801 \uac00\uce58\ub97c \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubcc0\ub7c9 \uc5ed\uc804\ud658 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc774 \ube5b \uc804\ub2ec\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc815\ud655\ud558\uace0 \ubbf8\ubd84 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \uc2e0\uacbd \ub300\ub9ac \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\uc758 \ube60\ub974\uace0 \ubbf8\ubd84 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc5ed \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \ud6c4\ubcf4\ub85c \uac04\uc8fc\ub41c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub300\ub9ac \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ub3c4\ud568\uc218\uac00 \uae30\ubcf8 \ubb3c\ub9ac \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc790\uc758 \ub3c4\ud568\uc218\ub97c \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \uc77c\uce58\uc2dc\ud0ac \uac83\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc740 \uc5c6\ub2e4. \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ub3c4\ud568\uc218\ub294 \uc5ed \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud575\uc2ec\uc801\uc774\ubbc0\ub85c, \ubaa8\ub378 \ub3c4\ud568\uc218\uc758 \uc624\ub958\ub294 \uace0\ucda9\uc2e4\ub3c4 \ubcf5\uc6d0\uc744 \ud604\uc800\ud788 \ubc29\ud574\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Sobolev \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378 \ub3c4\ud568\uc218\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \uc870\uc9c1 \ub0b4 \ube5b \uc804\ub2ec\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub300\ub9ac \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uac00 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c Sobolev \ud6c8\ub828\uc758 \ud615\ud0dc\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uc801\ud569\ud558\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ube5b \uc804\ub2ec \ub300\ub9ac \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc704\ud55c Sobolev \ud6c8\ub828\uc774 \ub3c4\ud568\uc218 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c, \ubd84\ud3ec \ub0b4 \ubc0f \ubd84\ud3ec \uc678 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uc624\ub958\ub3c4 \uc904\uc778\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uac1c\uc120\uc740 \ud2b9\ud788 \uc5ed \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\uc5b4 \ub300\ub9ac \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc720\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \uae30\ub300\ub41c\ub2e4."}}

Moving beyond population-level sentiment analysis, PRA integrates privacy and cognitive theories to simulate user-specific privacy reasoning grounded in personal comment histories and contextual cues. The agent reconstructs each user's \"privacy mind\", dynamically activates relevant privacy memory through a contextual filter that emulates bounded rationality, and generates synthetic comments reflecting how that user would likely respond to new privacy scenarios. A complementary LLM-as-a-Judge evaluator, calibrated against an established privacy concern taxonomy, quantifies the faithfulness of generated reasoning.

Includes link to GitHub repository and Docker image for reproducibility", "summary": "SMEs increasingly seek alternatives to cloud LLM APIs, which raise data privacy concerns. Dedicated cloud GPU instances offer improved privacy but with limited guarantees and ongoing costs, while professional on-premise hardware (A100, H100) remains prohibitively expensive. We present a systematic evaluation of NVIDIA's Blackwell consumer GPUs (RTX 5060 Ti, 5070 Ti, 5090) for production LLM inference, benchmarking four open-weight models (Qwen3-8B, Gemma3-12B, Gemma3-27B, GPT-OSS-20B) across 79 configurations spanning quantization formats (BF16, W4A16, NVFP4, MXFP4), context lengths (8k-64k), and three workloads: RAG, multi-LoRA agentic serving, and high-concurrency APIs. The RTX 5090 delivers 3.5-4.6x higher throughput than the 5060 Ti with 21x lower latency for RAG, but budget GPUs achieve the highest throughput-per-dollar for API workloads with sub-second latency. NVFP4 quantization provides 1.6x throughput over BF16 with 41% energy reduction and only 2-4% quality loss.

However, during agent inference, existing methods often suffer from (i) locally myopic generation, due to the absence of lookahead, and (ii) trajectory instability, where minor early errors can escalate into divergent reasoning paths. These issues make it difficult to balance global effectiveness and computational efficiency. To address these two issues, we propose meta-adaptive exploration with LLM agents https://github.com/exoskeletonzj/MAXS, a meta-adaptive reasoning framework based on LLM Agents that flexibly integrates tool execution and reasoning planning. MAXS employs a lookahead strategy to extend reasoning paths a few steps ahead, estimating the advantage value of tool usage, and combines step consistency variance and inter-step trend slopes to jointly select stable, consistent, and high-value reasoning steps. Additionally, we introduce a trajectory convergence mechanism that controls computational cost by halting further rollouts once path consistency is achieved, enabling a balance between resource efficiency and global effectiveness in multi-tool reasoning. We conduct extensive empirical studies across three base models (MiMo-VL-7B, Qwen2.5-VL-7B, Qwen2.5-VL-32B) and five datasets, demonstrating that MAXS consistently outperforms existing methods in both performance and inference efficiency. Further analysis confirms the effectiveness of our lookahead strategy and tool usage.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uba54\ud0c0 \uc801\uc751 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc804\uc5ed \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \uc0ac\uc774\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0\uc11c \ub85c\uceec \ub2e8\uae30 \uc0dd\uc131\uacfc \uada4\uc801 \ubd88\uc548\uc815\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\ub294\ub2e4.", "method": "LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uba54\ud0c0 \uc801\uc751 \ucd94\ub860 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 MAXS\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc2e4\ud589\uacfc \ucd94\ub860 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc720\uc5f0\ud558\uac8c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uace0, \ubbf8\ub9ac\ubcf4\uae30 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ucd94\ub860 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \ud655\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "MAXS\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \ucd94\ub860 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ucd08\uc6d4\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "MAXS\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub9ac\uc18c\uc2a4 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc804\uc5ed \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uc774\ub8e8\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub3c4\uad6c\uc758 \ud611\uc5c5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uace0\uc720\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ucd94\ub860 \uc911\uc5d0 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 (i) \ubbf8\ub9ac \ubcf4\uae30 \ubd80\uc7ac\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uad6d\uc18c\uc801 \ub2e8\uae30 \uc0dd\uc131\uacfc (ii) \uc0ac\uc18c\ud55c \ucd08\uae30 \uc624\ub958\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0b0\ud558\ub294 \ucd94\ub860 \uacbd\ub85c\ub85c \ud655\ub300\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uada4\uc801 \ubd88\uc548\uc815\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \uc804\uc5ed\uc801 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uacfc \uacc4\uc0b0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub835\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4ed\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc2e4\ud589\uacfc \ucd94\ub860 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc720\uc5f0\ud558\uac8c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uba54\ud0c0 \uc801\uc751 \ucd94\ub860 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 \uba54\ud0c0 \uc801\uc751 \ud0d0\uc0c9(MAXS)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, building these models is often labor-intensive and time-consuming. We address this by proposing LEAN-LLM-OPT, a LightwEight AgeNtic workflow construction framework for LLM-assisted large-scale OPTimization auto-formulation. LEAN-LLM-OPT takes as input a problem description together with associated datasets and orchestrates a team of LLM agents to produce an optimization formulation. Specifically, upon receiving a query, two upstream LLM agents dynamically construct a workflow that specifies, step-by-step, how optimization models for similar problems can be formulated. A downstream LLM agent then follows this workflow to generate the final output. Leveraging LLMs' text-processing capabilities and common modeling practices, the workflow decomposes the modeling task into a sequence of structured sub-tasks and offloads mechanical data-handling operations to auxiliary tools. This design alleviates the downstream agent's burden related to planning and data handling, allowing it to focus on the most challenging components that cannot be readily standardized. Extensive simulations show that LEAN-LLM-OPT, instantiated with GPT-4.1 and the open source gpt-oss-20B, achieves strong performance on large-scale optimization modeling tasks and is competitive with state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, in a Singapore Airlines choice-based revenue management use case, LEAN-LLM-OPT demonstrates practical value by achieving leading performance across a range of scenarios. Along the way, we introduce Large-Scale-OR and Air-NRM, the first comprehensive benchmarks for large-scale optimization auto-formulation.

However, human-driven responses are often fragmented and reactive, with policies formulated in isolation and adjusted only after outbreaks escalate, undermining proactive intervention and global pandemic mitigation. To address this challenge, here we propose a large language model (LLM) multi-agent policymaking framework that supports coordinated and proactive pandemic control across regions. Within our framework, each administrative region is assigned an LLM agent as an AI policymaking assistant. The agent reasons over region-specific epidemiological dynamics while communicating with other agents to account for cross-regional interdependencies. By integrating real-world data, a pandemic evolution simulator, and structured inter-agent communication, our framework enables agents to jointly explore counterfactual intervention scenarios and synthesize coordinated policy decisions through a closed-loop simulation process. We validate the proposed framework using state-level COVID-19 data from the United States between April and December 2020, together with real-world mobility records and observed policy interventions. Compared with real-world pandemic outcomes, our approach reduces cumulative infections and deaths by up to 63.7% and 40.1%, respectively, at the individual state level, and by 39.0% and 27.0%, respectively, when aggregated across states. These results demonstrate that LLM multi-agent systems can enable more effective pandemic control with coordinated policymaking...", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)

In this work, we highlight Hierarchical Implicit Intent Alignment for Personalized GUI Agent (PersonalAlign), a new agent task that requires agents to leverage long-term user records as persistent context to resolve omitted preferences in vague instructions and anticipate latent routines by user state for proactive assistance. To facilitate this study, we introduce AndroidIntent, a benchmark designed to evaluate agents' ability in resolving vague instructions and providing proactive suggestions through reasoning over long-term user records. We annotated 775 user-specific preferences and 215 routines from 20k long-term records across different users for evaluation. Furthermore, we introduce Hierarchical Intent Memory Agent (HIM-Agent), which maintains a continuously updating personal memory and hierarchically organizes user preferences and routines for personalization. Finally, we evaluate a range of GUI agents on AndroidIntent, including GPT-5, Qwen3-VL, and UI-TARS, further results show that HIM-Agent significantly improves both execution and proactive performance by 15.7% and 7.3%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c GUI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc554\ubb35\uc801 \uc758\ub3c4 \uc815\ub82c(PersonalAlign)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc758 \uc7a5\uae30 \uae30\ub85d\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ud638\ud55c \uc9c0\uce68\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0dd\ub7b5\ub41c \uc120\ud638\ub97c \ud574\uc18c\ud558\uace0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc758 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \ub8e8\ud2f4\uc744 \ubbf8\ub9ac \ud30c\uc545\ud558\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2e4\uc81c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \uc704\ud574 GUI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc758\ub3c4\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0 \uc870\uc815\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "AndroidIntent\ub77c\ub294 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ubaa8\ud638\ud55c \uc9c0\uce68\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0 \uc7a5\uae30 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uae30\ub85d\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \uc81c\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc758\ub3c4 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8(HIM-Agent)\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uc5ec \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub418\ub294 \uac1c\uc778 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ubc0f \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc120\ud638\uc640 \ub8e8\ud2f4\uc744 \uacc4\uce35\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc9c1\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "HIM-Agent\ub294 15.7%\uc640 7.3%\uc758 \uc2e4\ud589 \ubc0f \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801 \uc131\uacfc \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c GUI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c AndroidIntent\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 HIM-Agent\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "GUI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc644\uc804\ud55c \uc9c0\uce68 \uc544\ub798\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc2e4\uc81c \ubc30\uce58\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc758 \ub354 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc554\ubb35\uc801\uc778 \uc758\ub3c4\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucdb0\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c GUI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc554\ubb35\uc801 \uc758\ub3c4 \uc815\ub82c(PersonalAlign)\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ubaa8\ud638\ud55c \uc9c0\uce68\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0dd\ub7b5\ub41c \uc120\ud638\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0 \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801 \uc9c0\uc6d0\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \ub8e8\ud2f4\uc744 \uc608\uc0c1\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc7a5\uae30 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uae30\ub85d\uc744 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc73c\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ubaa8\ud638\ud55c \uc9c0\uce68\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0 \uc7a5\uae30 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uae30\ub85d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \uc81c\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c AndroidIntent\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 20k\uc758 \uc7a5\uae30 \uae30\ub85d\uc5d0\uc11c 775\uac1c\uc758 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc120\ud638\uc640 215\uac1c\uc758 \ub8e8\ud2f4\uc744 \uc8fc\uc11d \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uc5ec \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ub354 \ub098\uc544\uac00, \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc120\ud638\uc640 \ub8e8\ud2f4\uc744 \uacc4\uce35\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc9c1\ud558\ub294 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub418\ub294 \uac1c\uc778 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc758\ub3c4 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8(HIM-Agent)\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 GPT-5, Qwen3-VL, UI-TARS\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c GUI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c AndroidIntent\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, HIM-Agent\uac00 \uc2e4\ud589 \ubc0f \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \uac01\uac01 15.7%\uc640 7.3% \uac1c\uc120\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\ub2e4."}}

However, existing approaches remain fundamentally limited to text modality. Extending autonomous information-seeking agents to multimodal settings introduces critical challenges: the specialization-generalization trade-off that emerges when training models for multimodal tool-use at scale, and the severe scarcity of training data capturing complex, multi-step multimodal search trajectories. To address these challenges, we propose M$^3$Searcher, a modular multimodal information-seeking agent that explicitly decouples information acquisition from answer derivation. M$^3$Searcher is optimized with a retrieval-oriented multi-objective reward that jointly encourages factual accuracy, reasoning soundness, and retrieval fidelity.

Our approach follows a model-based paradigm, using Coloured Timed Petri Nets to represent the scheduling environment, and Maskable Proximal Policy Optimization to enable dynamic decision-making while restricting the agent to feasible actions at each decision point. To simulate realistic industrial conditions, dynamic job arrivals are modeled using a Gamma distribution, which captures complex temporal patterns such as bursts, clustering, and fluctuating workloads. Machine failures are modeled using a Weibull distribution to represent age-dependent degradation and wear-out dynamics. These stochastic models enable the framework to reflect real-world manufacturing scenarios better. In addition, we study two action-masking strategies: a non-gradient approach that overrides the probabilities of invalid actions, and a gradient-based approach that assigns negative gradients to invalid actions within the policy network. We conduct extensive experiments on dynamic JSSP benchmarks, demonstrating that our method consistently outperforms traditional heuristic and rule-based approaches in terms of makespan minimization. The results highlight the strength of combining interpretable Petri-net-based models with adaptive reinforcement learning policies, yielding a resilient, scalable, and explainable framework for real-time scheduling in dynamic and uncertain manufacturing environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc791\uc5c5\uc7a5

As such, we have a distinct and more challenging setting for autonomous driving. In this work, we consider a Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planning approach for single-agent autonomous driving in lane-free traffic, where the associated Markov Decision Process we formulate is influenced from existing approaches tied to reinforcement learning frameworks. In addition, MCTS is equipped with a pre-trained neural network (NN) that guides the selection phase. This procedure incorporates the predictive capabilities of NNs for a more informed tree search process under computational constraints. In our experimental evaluation, we consider metrics that address both safety (through collision rates) and efficacy (through measured speed). Then, we examine: (a) the influence of isotropic state information for vehicles in a lane-free environment, resulting in nudging behaviour--vehicles' policy reacts due to the presence of faster tailing ones, (b) the acceleration of performance for the NN-guided variant of MCTS, and (c) the trade-off between computational resources and solution quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ucc28\uc120 \uc5c6\ub294 \uad50\ud1b5 \ud658\uacbd\uc740 \ucc28\ub7c9\uc774 \ub3c4\ub85c\uc758 \uce21\uba74 \uc6a9\ub7c9\uc744 \ub354 \uc798 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \uad50\ud1b5 \ud750\ub984\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ucc28\uc120 \uc5c6\ub294 \uad50\ud1b5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uc728\uc8fc\ud589\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ubaac\ud14c\uce74\ub97c\ub85c \ud2b8\ub9ac \ud0d0\uc0c9(MCTS) \uacc4\ud68d \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ucc28\uc120 \uc5c6\ub294 \uad50\ud1b5 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uc728\uc8fc\ud589\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uacfc \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\ucc28\uc120 \uc5c6\ub294 \uad50\ud1b5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc790\uc728\uc8fc\ud589\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ubaac\ud14c\uce74\ub97c\ub85c \ud2b8\ub9ac \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uace0, \ubbf8\ub9ac \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc774 \uc120\ud0dd \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uc548\ub0b4\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud568.", "result": "\ucc28\uc120 \uc5c6\ub294 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ucc28\ub7c9 \uc815\ubcf4\uc758 \ub4f1\ubc29\uc131 \ud6a8\uacfc, \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc548\ub0b4\ub41c MCTS \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1, \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc790\uc6d0\uacfc \uc194\ub8e8\uc158 \ud488\uc9c8 \uac04\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud568.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc790\uc728\uc8fc\ud589 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \uc548\uc804\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ucc28\uc120 \uc5c6\ub294 \uad50\ud1b5 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 MCTS \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc758 \uc720\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucc28\uc120 \uc5c6\ub294 \uad50\ud1b5 \ud658\uacbd\uc740 \ucc28\ub7c9\uc774 \ucc28\uc120 \uc720\uc9c0\ub97c \ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \ub3c4\ub85c\uc758 \uce21\uba74 \uc6a9\ub7c9\uc744 \ub354 \uc798 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \uad50\ud1b5 \ud750\ub984\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc790\uc728 \uc8fc\ud589\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub69c\ub837\ud558\uace0 \ub354 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc778 \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \uac16\uac8c \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ucc28\uc120 \uc5c6\ub294 \uad50\ud1b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc790\uc728 \uc8fc\ud589\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ubaac\ud14c\uce74\ub97c\ub85c \ud2b8\ub9ac \ud0d0\uc0c9(MCTS) \uacc4\ud68d \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uac00 \uad6c\uc131\ud55c \uad00\ub828 \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815\uc740 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0 \uc5f0\uacb0\ub41c \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc5d0\uc11c \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubc1b\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c MCTS\ub294 \uc120\ud0dd \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc548\ub0b4\ud558\ub294 \ubbf8\ub9ac \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(NN)\uc744 \uc7a5\ucc29\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc808\ucc28\ub294 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc81c\uc57d \uc544\ub798\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc815\ubcf4\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \ud2b8\ub9ac \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \uc704\ud574 NN\uc758 \uc608\uce21 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc548\uc804(\ucda9\ub3cc\uc728\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574)\uacfc \ud6a8\uc728\uc131(\uce21\uc815\ub41c \uc18d\ub3c4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574)\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8e8\ub294 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7f0 \ub2e4\uc74c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 (a) \ucc28\uc120 \uc5c6\ub294 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ucc28\ub7c9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub4f1\ubc29\uc131 \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc815\ubcf4\uc758 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc0b4\ud3b4\ubcf4\uc544, \ub354 \ube60\ub978 \ucd94\uc885 \ucc28\ub7c9\uc758 \uc874\uc7ac\ub85c \ucc28\ub7c9 \uc815\ucc45\uc774 \ubc18\uc751\ud558\ub294 \ub108\uc9d5 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uacb0\uacfc\ub85c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uba70, (b) NN\uc73c\ub85c \uc548\ub0b4\ub41c MCTS \ubcc0\ud615\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1, (c) \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc790\uc6d0\uacfc \uc194\ub8e8\uc158 \ud488\uc9c8 \uac04\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

This limitation hinders their ability to maintain long-term user's intents and dynamically adapt to evolving external environments. In this paper, we propose a novel interaction paradigm for proactive Task-oriented Agents capable of bridging the gap between relatively static user's needs and a dynamic environment. We formalize proactivity through two key capabilities, (i) Intent-Conditioned Monitoring: The agent autonomously formulates trigger conditions based on dialog history; (ii) Event-Triggered Follow-up: The agent actively engages the user upon detecting useful environmental updates. We introduce a high-quality data synthesis pipeline to construct complex, multi-turn dialog data in a dynamic environment. Furthermore, we attempt to address the lack of evaluation criteria of task-oriented interaction in a dynamic environment by proposing a new benchmark, namely ChronosBench. We evaluated some leading close-source and open-source models at present and revealed their flaws in long-term task-oriented interaction. Furthermore, our fine-tuned model trained using synthetic data for supervised learning achieves a task completion rate of 85.19% for complex tasks including shifts in user intent, outperforming other models under test.

Recent work therefore explores self-evolution by allowing agents to rewrite their own code or prompts to improve problem-solving ability, but unconstrained optimization often triggers instability, hallucinations, and instruction drift. We propose EvoFSM, a structured self-evolving framework that achieves both adaptability and control by evolving an explicit Finite State Machine (FSM) instead of relying on free-form rewriting. EvoFSM decouples the optimization space into macroscopic Flow (state-transition logic) and microscopic Skill (state-specific behaviors), enabling targeted improvements under clear behavioral boundaries. Guided by a critic mechanism, EvoFSM refines the FSM through a small set of constrained operations, and further incorporates a self-evolving memory that distills successful trajectories as reusable priors and failure patterns as constraints for future queries.

Task2Quiz: A Paradigm for Studying Environment Understanding", "comment": null, "summary": "Large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex decision-making and tool-use tasks, yet their ability to generalize across varying environments remains a under-examined concern. Current evaluation paradigms predominantly rely on trajectory-based metrics that measure task success, while failing to assess whether agents possess a grounded, transferable model of the environment. To address this gap, we propose Task-to-Quiz (T2Q), a deterministic and automated evaluation paradigm designed to decouple task execution from world-state understanding. We instantiate this paradigm in T2QBench, a suite comprising 30 environments and 1,967 grounded QA pairs across multiple difficulty levels. Our extensive experiments reveal that task success is often a poor proxy for environment understanding, and that current memory machanism can not effectively help agents acquire a grounded model of the environment. These findings identify proactive exploration and fine-grained state representation as primary bottlenecks, offering a robust foundation for developing more generalizable autonomous agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud658\uacbd \uc774\ud574 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud3c9\uac00 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc778 Task-to-Quiz (T2Q)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac80\uc0ac\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc788\uc74c.", "method": "Task-to-Quiz (T2Q)\ub77c\ub294 \uacb0\uc815\ub860\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ud3c9\uac00 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, T2QBench\ub77c\ub294 30\uac1c\uc758 \ud658\uacbd\uacfc 1,967\uac1c\uc758 QA \uc30d\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2a4\uc704\ud2b8\ub97c \uad6c\ud604\ud568.", "result": "\uacfc\uc81c \uc131\uacf5\uc774 \ud658\uacbd \uc774\ud574\uc758 \uc88b\uc740 proxy\uac00 \uc544\ub2c8\uba70, \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uae30\uc5b5 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774 \ud658\uacbd \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc774 \ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90c.", "conclusion": "\uc801\uadf9\uc801 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uacfc \uc138\ubc00\ud55c \uc0c1\ud0dc \ud45c\ud604\uc774 \uc8fc\uc694 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub098\uba70, \ub354 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub41c \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud568.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \ubc0f \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub180\ub77c\uc6b4 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc73c\ub098, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc740 \uc544\uc9c1 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \uac80\ud1a0\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc740 \uc8fc\ub85c \uc791\uc5c5 \uc131\uacf5\uc744 \uce21\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uada4\uc801 \uae30\ubc18 \uc9c0\ud45c\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ud658\uacbd\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ud558\uace0 \uc804\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uc18c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Task-to-Quiz (T2Q)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc2e4\ud589\uc744 \uc138\uacc4 \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc774\ud574\uc640 \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uacb0\uc815\ub860\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ud3c9\uac00 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 T2QBench\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \uad6c\ud604\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub09c\uc774\ub3c4\uc758 30\uac1c \ud658\uacbd\uacfc 1,967\uac1c\uc758 \uae30\ubc18 QA \uc30d\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc131\uacf5\uc774 \uc885\uc885 \ud658\uacbd \uc774\ud574\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc88b\uc740 \ub300\ub9ac \ubcc0\uc218\uac00 \uc544\ub2cc \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\uc73c\uba70, \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uae30\uc5b5 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ud658\uacbd\uc758 \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2b5\ub4dd\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc774 \ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc74c\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc1c\uacac\uc740 \uc801\uadf9\uc801\uc778 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ubc0f \uc138\ubc00\ud55c \uc0c1\ud0dc \ud45c\ud604\uc774 \uc8fc\uc694 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc778\ub418\uba70, \ub354 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub41c \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, multi-agent RL (MARL) training is resource-intensive and unstable: co-adapting teammates induce non-stationarity, and rewards are often sparse and high-variance. Therefore, we introduce \\textbf{Multi-Agent Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (MATTRL)}, a framework that injects structured textual experience into multi-agent deliberation at inference time. MATTRL forms a multi-expert team of specialists for multi-turn discussions, retrieves and integrates test-time experiences, and reaches consensus for final decision-making. We also study credit assignment for constructing a turn-level experience pool, then reinjecting it into the dialogue. Across challenging benchmarks in medicine, math, and education, MATTRL improves accuracy by an average of 3.67\\% over a multi-agent baseline, and by 8.67\\% over comparable single-agent baselines. Ablation studies examine different credit-assignment schemes and provide a detailed comparison of how they affect training outcomes.

While many of these disruptions originate deep in the supply network, most companies still lack visibility beyond Tier-1 suppliers, leaving upstream vulnerabilities undetected until the impact cascades downstream. To overcome this blind-spot and move from reactive recovery to proactive resilience, we introduce a minimally supervised agentic AI framework that autonomously monitors, analyses, and responds to disruptions across extended supply networks. The architecture comprises seven specialised agents powered by large language models and deterministic tools that jointly detect disruption signals from unstructured news, map them to multi-tier supplier networks, evaluate exposure based on network structure, and recommend mitigations such as alternative sourcing options. \\rev{We evaluate the framework across 30 synthesised scenarios covering three automotive manufacturers and five disruption classes. The system achieves high accuracy across core tasks, with F1 scores between 0.962 and 0.991, and performs full end-to-end analyses in a mean of 3.83 minutes at a cost of \\$0.0836 per disruption. Relative to industry benchmarks of multi-day, analyst-driven assessments, this represents a reduction of more than three orders of magnitude in response time. A real-world case study of the 2022 Russia-Ukraine conflict further demonstrates operational applicability. This work establishes a foundational step toward building resilient, proactive, and autonomous supply chains capable of managing disruptions across deep-tier networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ud604\ub300
