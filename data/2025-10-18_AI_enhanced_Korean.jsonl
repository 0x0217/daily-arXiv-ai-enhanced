Existing prompt\ninjection detection methods often have sub-optimal performance and/or high\ncomputational overhead. In this work, we propose PIShield, a detection method\nthat is both effective and efficient. Our key observation is that the internal\nrepresentation of the final token in a prompt-extracted from a specific layer\nof the LLM, which we term the injection-critical layer-captures distinguishing\nfeatures between clean and contaminated prompts. Leveraging this insight, we\ntrain a simple linear classifier on these internal representations using a\nlabeled set of clean and contaminated prompts. We compare PIShield against 11\nbaselines across 5 diverse benchmark datasets and 8 prompt injection attacks.\nThe results demonstrate that PIShield is both highly effective and efficient,\nsubstantially outperforming existing methods.

However,\nincreasing digital integration has exposed these systems to escalating cyber\nthreats. Historical attacks like Stuxnet and the Ukraine power grid incident\nrevealed exploitable weaknesses-poor network segmentation, outdated software,\nweak authentication, and inadequate monitoring-that persist in many U.S. ICS\nenvironments today. This paper analyzes these landmark attacks to identify\nrecurring vulnerabilities and assess their relevance to current U.S.\ninfrastructure.

The safety, security, and functionality of these systems are critical,\nespecially in high-stakes applications. However, the current ecosystem of\ninter-agent communication is fragmented, with protocols such as the Model\nContext Protocol (MCP) for tool access and the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol\nfor coordination being analyzed in isolation. This fragmentation creates a\nsemantic gap that prevents the rigorous analysis of system properties and\nintroduces risks such as architectural misalignment and exploitable\ncoordination issues. To address these challenges, we introduce a modeling\nframework for agentic AI systems composed of two foundational models. The\nfirst, the host agent model, formalizes the top-level entity that interacts\nwith the user, decomposes tasks, and orchestrates their execution by leveraging\nexternal agents and tools. The second, the task lifecycle model, details the\nstates and transitions of individual sub-tasks from creation to completion,\nproviding a fine-grained view of task management and error handling. Together,\nthese models provide a unified semantic framework for reasoning about the\nbehavior of multi-AI agent systems. Grounded in this framework, we define 17\nproperties for the host agent and 14 for the task lifecycle, categorized into\nliveness, safety, completeness, and fairness. Expressed in temporal logic,\nthese properties enable formal verification of system behavior, detection of\ncoordination edge cases, and prevention of deadlocks and security\nvulnerabilities. Through this effort, we introduce the first rigorously\ngrounded, domain-agnostic framework for the systematic analysis, design, and\ndeployment of correct, reliable, and robust agentic AI systems.",

By decomposing difficult tasks with long contexts into\nshorter, manageable ones, recent multi-agent paradigms offer a promising\nnear-term solution to this problem. However, the fundamental capacities of such\nsystems are poorly understood. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework\nto analyze the expressivity of multi-agent systems. We apply our framework to\nthree algorithmic families: state tracking, recall, and $k$-hop reasoning. We\nderive bounds on (i) the number of agents required to solve the task exactly,\n(ii) the quantity and structure of inter-agent communication, and (iii) the\nachievable speedups as problem size and context scale. Our results identify\nregimes where communication is provably beneficial, delineate tradeoffs between\nagent count and bandwidth, and expose intrinsic limitations when either\nresource is constrained. We complement our theoretical analysis with a set of\nexperiments on pretrained LLMs using controlled synthetic benchmarks.

This paper argues for an\nalternative regulatory approach that ensures AI safety while actively promoting\ninnovation: mandating that large AI laboratories release small, openly\naccessible analog models (scaled-down versions) trained similarly to and\ndistilled from their largest proprietary models.\n  Analog models serve as public proxies, allowing broad participation in safety\nverification, interpretability research, and algorithmic transparency without\nforcing labs to disclose their full-scale models. Recent research demonstrates\nthat safety and interpretability methods developed using these smaller models\ngeneralize effectively to frontier-scale systems. By enabling the wider\nresearch community to directly investigate and innovate upon accessible\nanalogs, our policy substantially reduces the regulatory burden and accelerates\nsafety advancements.\n  This mandate promises minimal additional costs, leveraging reusable resources\nlike data and infrastructure, while significantly contributing to the public\ngood.

Current most effective\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, like LFS-GAN, introduce a non-negligible\nquantity of new weights at each training iteration, which would become\nsignificant when considering the long term.

In order to optimize even further the size of the adapters, we\nchallenged LoRA limits introducing a LoRA in LoRA (LLoRA) technique for\nconvolutional layers.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of CoLoR-GAN through experiments on\nseveral benchmark CL and FS tasks and show that our model is efficient,\nreaching SOTA performance but with a number of resources enormously reduced.\nSource code is available on\n\\href{https://github.com/munsifali11/CoLoR-GAN}{Github.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc2dc\uac04\uc774 \uc9c0\ub0a8\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc801\uc751\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc801\uc740 \uc790\uc6d0\uc73c\ub85c \ucd5c\uace0\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 CoLoR-GAN\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "GANs\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \uc801\uc740 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub85c \ubc30\uc6b0\uba74\uc11c \ub9dd\uac01\uc744 \ubc29\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "CoLoR-GAN\uc740 \uc800\ucc28 \ud150\uc11c\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801 \ubc0f \uc801\uc740 \uc0d8\ud50c \ud559\uc2b5(FS)\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "result": "CoLoR-GAN\uc740 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c CL \ubc0f FS \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uba70, \uc790\uc6d0\uc744 \ub300\ud3ed \uc904\uc774\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 SOTA \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0 \ub3c4\ub2ec\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "LoRA\uc758 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \uc120\ud0dd\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\uc99d \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc5ec \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uac12\uc744 \uc27d\uac8c \ucc3e\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc0dd\uc131\uc801 \uc801\ub300 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(GAN) \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5(CL)\uc740 \ud2b9\ud788 \uc7ac\uc559\uc801 \ub9dd\uac01 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc801\uc740 \uc0f7(FS) \uc0d8\ud50c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ubc30\uc6b0\ub294 \uac83\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc778 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud604\uc7ac \uac00\uc7a5 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8(SOTA) \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 LFS-GAN\uc740 \uac01 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc5d0\uc11c \ubb34\uc2dc\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc591\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc7a5\uae30\uc801\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud574\uc9c8 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 FS\uc640 CL\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \uc800\ucc28 \ub7ad\ud06c \uc801\uc751\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801 \uc801\uc740 \uc0f7 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c CoLoR-GAN\uc774\ub77c\uace0 \ud558\uba70, \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc801\uc751\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba74\uc11c \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\uc758 \uc218\ub97c \uc904\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6d0\ub798 LoRA \uad6c\ud604\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uaf64 \uc88b\uc740 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc5bb\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5b4\ub311\ud130\uc758 \ud06c\uae30\ub97c \ub354\uc6b1 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud569\uc131\uacf1 \uce35\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 LoRA\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ub3c4\uc804\ud558\ub294 LoRA in LoRA(LLoRA) \uae30\uc220\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c LoRA\uc758 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \uc120\ud0dd\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ub41c \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uc778\uc9c0\ud558\uace0, \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130\ub97c \uc27d\uac8c \ucc3e\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \uc2e4\uc99d \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c CL \ubc0f FS \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c CoLoR-GAN\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uace0, \uc790\uc6d0\uc744 \ub300\ud3ed \uc904\uc774\uba74\uc11c SOTA \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0 \ub3c4\ub2ec\ud588\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

We model the task as a\nmulti-objective, token-level Markov Decision Process (MDP), where each\nobjective corresponds to an agent's preference. Token-level rewards for each\nagent are derived from their policy (e.g., a personalized language model). This\napproach utilizes the finding that such policies implicitly define optimal\nQ-functions, providing a principled way to quantify rewards at each generation\nstep without a value function (Rafailov et al., 2024). This MDP formulation\ncreates a formal structure amenable to analysis using principles from social\nchoice theory. We propose two approaches grounded in social choice theory.\nFirst, we propose a stochastic generation policy guaranteed to be in the\nex-ante core, extending core stability concepts from voting theory to text\ngeneration. This policy is derived from an underlying distribution over\ncomplete statements that maximizes proportional fairness (Nash Welfare).\nSecond, for generating a single statement, we target the maximization of\negalitarian welfare using search algorithms within the MDP framework.\nEmpirically, experiments using language models to instantiate agent policies\nshow that search guided by the egalitarian objective generates consensus\nstatements with improved worst-case agent alignment compared to baseline\nmethods, including the Habermas Machine (Tessler et al., 2024).", "AI": {"tldr":

Accepted at the 3rd UniReps Workshop @ NeurIPS\n  2025", "summary": "Model merging provides a cost-effective and data-efficient combination of\nspecialized deep neural networks through parameter integration. This technique\nleverages expert models across downstream tasks without requiring retraining.\nMost model merging approaches critically depend on scaling hyper-parameters\n$\\lambda$, which weight each model's contribution globally or individually.\nPrincipled approaches for setting scaling factors without accessing any data\n(data-free) are scarce, often leading researchers to tune $\\lambda$ using\nprivileged data from the evaluation set, which is obviously unfeasible in\npractice. To address this limitation, we introduce Weight Weaving, a\nplug-and-play technique that pools model weights across $\\lambda$ values search\nspace using user-defined pooling functions, such as averaging, random\nselection, or even existing model merging methods. Our method demonstrates high\nmodularity, imposing minimal constraints on the search space. It operates\northogonally to existing model merging methods and eliminates evaluation data\nrequirements. We validate Weight Weaving across three ViT variants in three\nexperimental setups: vision multi-task learning, vision continual learning, and\ndomain generalization. Our method consistently improves the performance of\nseveral model merging methods, achieving average accuracy gains of up to 15.9\npercentage points in a data-free setting.", "AI": {"tldr":

We provide a theoretical\nanalysis of a simple and widely used method - gradient ascent - used to reverse\nthe influence of a specific data point without retraining from scratch.\nLeveraging the implicit bias of gradient descent towards solutions that satisfy\nthe Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of a margin maximization problem, we\nquantify the quality of the unlearned model by evaluating how well it satisfies\nthese conditions w.r.t. the retained data. To formalize this idea, we propose a\nnew success criterion, termed \\textbf{$(\\epsilon, \\delta, \\tau)$-successful}\nunlearning, and show that, for both linear models and two-layer neural networks\nwith high dimensional data, a properly scaled gradient-ascent step satisfies\nthis criterion and yields a model that closely approximates the retrained\nsolution on the retained data. We also show that gradient ascent performs\nsuccessful unlearning while still preserving generalization in a synthetic\nGaussian-mixture setting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uae30\uacc4 \ube44\ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \ud2b9\uc815 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc81c\uac70\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud558\uba70, \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \ubc0f \uc724\ub9ac\uc801 \ubb38\uc81c\uc640 \uad00\ub828\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8\uc758 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ub418\ub3cc\ub9ac\ub294 \ub370 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \uac04\ub2e8\ud558\uace0 \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uc0c1\uc2b9\ubc95\uc744 \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638\uc640 \uc724\ub9ac\uc801 \uc6b0\ub824\uac00 \ucee4\uc9d0\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uae30\uacc4 \ube44\ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc99d\ub300\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uc0c1\uc2b9\ubc95\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud2b9\uc815 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8\uc758 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ub418\ub3cc\ub9ac\uba70, Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) \uc870\uac74\uc744 \ub9cc\uc871\ud558\ub294 \uc810\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ubcf4\uc720\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c KKT \uc870\uac74\uc744 \uc798 \ub9cc\uc871\ud558\uba70, \uc801\uc808\ud55c \ud06c\uae30\ub85c \uc870\uc815\ub41c \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uc0c1\uc2b9 \ub2e8\uacc4\uac00 \uc131\uacf5 \uae30\uc900\uc778 $(\theta, \tau)$-\uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc778 \ube44\ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ub9cc\uc871\ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uc0c1\uc2b9\ubc95\uc740 \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc778 \ube44\ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uae30\uacc4 \ube44\ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \ud2b9\uc815 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc81c\uac70\ud558\uc5ec \uc99d\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \ubc0f \uc724\ub9ac\uc801 \uc6b0\ub824\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ucc98\uc74c\ubd80\ud130 \ub2e4\uc2dc \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \ud2b9\uc815 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8\uc758 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ub418\ub3cc\ub9ac\ub294 \ub370 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \uac04\ub2e8\ud558\uace0 \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uc0c1\uc2b9\ubc95\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c4 \uadf9\ub300\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\uc758 Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) \uc870\uac74\uc744 \ub9cc\uc871\ud558\ub294 \ud574\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \ud558\uac15\uc758 \uc554\ubb35\uc801 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubcf4\uc720\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c KKT \uc870\uac74\uc744 \uc5bc\ub9c8\ub098 \uc798 \ub9cc\uc871\ud558\ub294\uc9c0 \ud3c9\uac00\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ube44\ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc544\uc774\ub514\uc5b4\ub97c \ud615\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \textbf{$(\theta, \tau)$-\uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc778} \ube44\ud559\uc2b5\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc131\uacf5 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc120\ud615 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \ub450 \uce35 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc801\uc808\ud558\uac8c \uc870\uc815\ub41c \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uc0c1\uc2b9 \ub2e8\uacc4\uac00 \uc774 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \ub9cc\uc871\ud558\uace0 \ubcf4\uc720\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc7ac\ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc5d0 \uadfc\uc811\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub610\ud55c \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uc0c1\uc2b9\ubc95\uc774 \ud569\uc131 \uac00\uc6b0\uc2dc\uc548 \ud63c\ud569 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \ubcf4\uc874\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc778 \ube44\ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Coordinated building\nenergy management faces critical challenges in exploiting spatial-temporal\ndependencies while ensuring operational safety across multi-building systems.\nCurrent multi-building energy systems face three key challenges: insufficient\nspatial-temporal information exploitation, lack of rigorous safety guarantees,\nand system complexity. This paper proposes Spatial-Temporal Enhanced Safe\nMulti-Agent Coordination (STEMS), a novel safety-constrained multi-agent\nreinforcement learning framework for coordinated building energy management.\nSTEMS integrates two core components: (1) a spatial-temporal graph\nrepresentation learning framework using a GCN-Transformer fusion architecture\nto capture inter-building relationships and temporal patterns, and (2) a\nsafety-constrained multi-agent RL algorithm incorporating Control Barrier\nFunctions to provide mathematical safety guarantees. Extensive experiments on\nreal-world building datasets demonstrate STEMS's superior performance over\nexisting methods, showing that STEMS achieves 21% cost reduction, 18% emission\nreduction, and dramatically reduces safety violations from 35.1% to 5.6% while\nmaintaining optimal comfort with only 0.13 discomfort proportion. The framework\nalso demonstrates strong robustness during extreme weather conditions and\nmaintains effectiveness across different building types.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uac74\ubb3c \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uad00\ub9ac\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uacfc \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uacf5\uac04-\uc2dc\uac04 \uac15\ud654 \uc548\uc804 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc870\uc815(STEMS) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uac74\ubb3c \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uad00\ub9ac\ub294 \ud0c4\uc18c \uac10\ucd95 \ubaa9\ud45c \ub2ec\uc131, \uac70\uc8fc\uc790 \ud3b8\uc548\ud568 \uac1c\uc120 \ubc0f \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \ube44\uc6a9 \uc808\uac10\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "STEMS\ub294 GCN-Transformer \uc735\ud569 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uacf5\uac04-\uc2dc\uac04 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc640 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc774 \uad6c\ud604\ub41c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "STEMS\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 21%\uc758 \ube44\uc6a9 \uc808\uac10, 18%\uc758 \ubc30\ucd9c\uac00\uc2a4 \uac10\uc18c \ubc0f \uc548\uc804 \uc704\ubc18\ub960\uc744 35.1%\uc5d0\uc11c 5.6%\ub85c Dramatically \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba74\uc11c \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \ud3b8\uc548\ud568\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uadf9\ud55c \ub0a0\uc528 \uc870\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uace0 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uac74\ubb3c \uc720\ud615\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac74\ubb3c \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uad00\ub9ac\ub294 \ud0c4\uc18c \uac10\ucd95 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uac70\uc8fc\uc790 \ud3b8\uc548\ud568\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uba70 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uc904\uc774\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc870\uc815\ub41c \uac74\ubb3c \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uad00\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uac74\ubb3c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc6b4\uc601 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uacf5\uac04-\uc2dc\uac04 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \uac74\ubb3c \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \ubb38\uc81c\uc810\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4: \ubd88\ucda9\ubd84\ud55c \uacf5\uac04-\uc2dc\uac04 \uc815\ubcf4 \ud65c\uc6a9, \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \uc548\uc804 \ubcf4\uc7a5 \ubd80\uc871, \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc548\uc804\uc774 \uc81c\uc57d\ub41c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 \uacf5\uac04-\uc2dc\uac04 \uac15\ud654 \uc548\uc804 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc870\uc815(STEMS)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

In this work, we instead evaluate\ndata-fidelity collectively by testing whether the observed measurements are\nstatistically consistent with the noise distributions implied by the current\nestimate. We adopt this aggregated perspective and introduce distributional\nconsistency (DC) loss, a data-fidelity objective that replaces pointwise\nmatching with distribution-level calibration using model-based probability\nscores for each measurement. DC loss acts as a direct and practical plug-in\nreplacement for standard data consistency terms: i) it is compatible with\nmodern regularizers, ii) it is optimized in the same way as traditional losses,\nand iii) it avoids overfitting to measurement noise even without the use of\npriors. Its scope naturally fits many practical inverse problems where the\nmeasurement-noise distribution is known and where the measured dataset consists\nof many independent noisy values. We demonstrate efficacy in two key example\napplication areas: i) in image denoising with deep image prior, using DC\ninstead of MSE loss removes the need for early stopping and achieves higher\nPSNR; ii) in medical image reconstruction from Poisson-noisy data, DC loss\nreduces artifacts in highly-iterated reconstructions and enhances the efficacy\nof hand-crafted regularization.

However,\nvendor documentation is often unavailable at test time. It is either misplaced,\nmismatched, poorly formatted, or incomplete, which makes schema mapping\nchallenging. We introduce a reinforcement learning agent that can self-improve\nwithout labeled examples or model weight updates. During inference, the agent:\n1) Identifies ambiguous field-mapping attempts. 2) Generates targeted\nweb-search queries to gather external evidence. 3) Applies a confidence-based\nreward to iteratively refine its mappings. To demonstrate this concept, we\nconverted Microsoft Defender for Endpoint logs into a common schema. Our method\nincreased mapping accuracy from 56.4\\%(LLM-only) to 72.73\\%(RAG) to 93.94\\%\nover 100 iterations using GPT-4o.

While prior work\nhas explored these dynamics in both richly contextualized simulations and\nsimplified game-theoretic environments, most LLM systems featuring common-pool\nresource (CPR) games provide agents with explicit reward functions directly\ntied to their actions. In contrast, human cooperation often emerges without\nfull visibility into payoffs and population, relying instead on heuristics,\ncommunication, and punishment. We introduce a CPR simulation framework that\nremoves explicit reward signals and embeds cultural-evolutionary mechanisms:\nsocial learning (adopting strategies and beliefs from successful peers) and\nnorm-based punishment, grounded in Ostrom's principles of resource governance.\nAgents also individually learn from the consequences of harvesting, monitoring,\nand punishing via environmental feedback, enabling norms to emerge\nendogenously. We establish the validity of our simulation by reproducing key\nfindings from existing studies on human behavior. Building on this, we examine\nnorm evolution across a $2\\times2$ grid of environmental and social\ninitialisations (resource-rich vs. resource-scarce; altruistic vs. selfish) and\nbenchmark how agentic societies comprised of different LLMs perform under these\nconditions. Our results reveal systematic model differences in sustaining\ncooperation and norm formation, positioning the framework as a rigorous testbed\nfor studying emergent norms in mixed-motive LLM societies. Such analysis can\ninform the design of AI systems deployed in social and organizational contexts,\nwhere alignment with cooperative norms is critical for stability, fairness, and\neffective governance of AI-mediated environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud611\ub825 \uaddc\ubc94\uc774 \ubb34\ud615

Existing evaluations often\nrely on either simplistic synthetic datasets or downstream performance on\nreal-world tasks, generally suffering a dilemma between realism and evaluative\nprecision. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmark for CRL using\nhigh-fidelity simulated visual data that retains both realistic visual\ncomplexity and, more importantly, access to ground-truth causal generating\nprocesses. The dataset comprises around 200 thousand images and 3 million video\nframes across 24 sub-scenes in four domains: static image generation, dynamic\nphysical simulations, robotic manipulations, and traffic situation analysis.\nThese scenarios range from static to dynamic settings, simple to complex\nstructures, and single to multi-agent interactions, offering a comprehensive\ntestbed that hopefully bridges the gap between rigorous evaluation and\nreal-world applicability. In addition, we provide flexible access to the\nunderlying causal structures, allowing users to modify or configure them to\nalign with the required assumptions in CRL, such as available domain labels,\ntemporal dependencies, or intervention histories. Leveraging this benchmark, we\nevaluated representative CRL methods across diverse paradigms and offered\nempirical insights to assist practitioners and newcomers in choosing or\nextending appropriate CRL frameworks to properly address specific types of real\nproblems that can benefit from the CRL perspective.

Addressing the critical challenge of\nannotation backlogs in financial services, where millions of customer\nutterances require accurate categorization, MAFA combines specialized agents\nwith structured reasoning and a judge-based consensus mechanism. Our framework\nuniquely supports dynamic task adaptation, allowing organizations to define\ncustom annotation types (FAQs, intents, entities, or domain-specific\ncategories) through configuration rather than code changes. Deployed at JP\nMorgan Chase, MAFA has eliminated a 1 million utterance backlog while\nachieving, on average, 86% agreement with human annotators, annually saving\nover 5,000 hours of manual annotation work. The system processes utterances\nwith annotation confidence classifications, which are typically 85% high, 10%\nmedium, and 5% low across all datasets we tested. This enables human annotators\nto focus exclusively on ambiguous and low-coverage cases. We demonstrate MAFA's\neffectiveness across multiple datasets and languages, showing consistent\nimprovements over traditional and single-agent annotation baselines: 13.8%\nhigher Top-1 accuracy, 15.1% improvement in Top-5 accuracy, and 16.9% better F1\nin our internal intent classification dataset and similar gains on public\nbenchmarks.

Our\nresults show that jailbreak tuning makes harassment nearly guaranteed with an\nattack success rate of 95.78--96.89% vs. 57.25--64.19% without tuning in Llama,\nand 99.33% vs. 98.46% without tuning in Gemini, while sharply reducing refusal\nrate to 1-2% in both models. The most prevalent toxic behaviors are Insult with\n84.9--87.8% vs. 44.2--50.8% without tuning, and Flaming with 81.2--85.1% vs.\n31.5--38.8% without tuning, indicating weaker guardrails compared to sensitive\ncategories such as sexual or racial harassment. Qualitative evaluation further\nreveals that attacked agents reproduce human-like aggression profiles, such as\nMachiavellian/psychopathic patterns under planning, and narcissistic tendencies\nwith memory. Counterintuitively, closed-source and open-source models exhibit\ndistinct escalation trajectories across turns, with closed-source models\nshowing significant vulnerability. Overall, our findings show that multi-turn\nand theory-grounded attacks not only succeed at high rates but also mimic\nhuman-like harassment dynamics, motivating the development of robust safety\nguardrails to ultimately keep online platforms safe and responsible.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub300\ud654\ud615 \uc6f9 \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c

We introduce ConDA (Contrastive\nDiffusion Alignment), a framework that applies contrastive learning within\ndiffusion embeddings to align latent geometry with system dynamics. Motivated\nby recent advances showing that contrastive objectives can recover more\ndisentangled and structured representations, ConDA organizes diffusion latents\nsuch that traversal directions reflect underlying dynamical factors. Within\nthis contrastively structured space, ConDA enables nonlinear trajectory\ntraversal that supports faithful interpolation, extrapolation, and controllable\ngeneration.

Existing\nbenchmarks fall short of these principles, often focusing on narrow domains or\nposing ambiguous questions that hinder fair comparison. Guided by these\nprinciples, we introduce LiveResearchBench, a benchmark of 100 expert-curated\ntasks spanning daily life, enterprise, and academia, each requiring extensive,\ndynamic, real-time web search and synthesis. Built with over 1,500 hours of\nhuman labor, LiveResearchBench provides a rigorous basis for systematic\nevaluation. To evaluate citation-grounded long-form reports, we introduce\nDeepEval, a comprehensive suite covering both content- and report-level\nquality, including coverage, presentation, citation accuracy and association,\nconsistency and depth of analysis. DeepEval integrates four complementary\nevaluation protocols, each designed to ensure stable assessment and high\nagreement with human judgments. Using LiveResearchBench and DeepEval, we\nconduct a comprehensive evaluation of 17 frontier deep research systems,\nincluding single-agent web search, single-agent deep research, and multi-agent\nsystems.

Policy optimization, despite its success in standard RL, remains\ntheoretically and empirically underexplored in robust RL. To bridge this gap,\nwe propose \\textbf{D}istributionally \\textbf{R}obust \\textbf{R}egularized\n\\textbf{P}olicy \\textbf{O}ptimization algorithm (DR-RPO), a model-free online\npolicy optimization method that learns robust policies with sublinear regret.\nTo enable tractable optimization within the softmax policy class, DR-RPO\nincorporates reference-policy regularization, yielding RMDP variants that are\ndoubly constrained in both transitions and policies.

Through controlled\nexperiments in a search-agent setting, we identify two key determinants of\nscalable agent training: the source of reward signals and the scale of agent\ntask data. We find that rewards from a Generative Reward Model (GRM) outperform\nrigid rule-based signals for open-domain learning, and that co-evolving the GRM\nwith the policy further boosts performance. Increasing the volume of agent task\ndata-even when synthetically generated-substantially enhances agentic\ncapabilities. Building on these insights, we propose \\textbf{Agentic\nSelf-Learning} (ASL), a fully closed-loop, multi-role reinforcement learning\nframework that unifies task generation, policy execution, and evaluation within\na shared tool environment and LLM backbone. ASL coordinates a Prompt Generator,\na Policy Model, and a Generative Reward Model to form a virtuous cycle of\nharder task setting, sharper verification, and stronger solving. Empirically,\nASL delivers steady, round-over-round gains, surpasses strong RLVR baselines\n(e.g., Search-R1) that plateau or degrade, and continues improving under\nzero-labeled-data conditions, indicating superior sample efficiency and\nrobustness. We further show that GRM verification capacity is the main\nbottleneck: if frozen, it induces reward hacking and stalls progress; continual\nGRM training on the evolving data distribution mitigates this, and a small\nlate-stage injection of real verification data raises the performance ceiling.\nThis work establishes reward source and data scale as critical levers for\nopen-domain agent learning and demonstrates the efficacy of multi-role\nco-evolution for scalable, self-improving agents.

We introduce the\nActively Observable Markov Decision Process (AOMDP), where an agent not only\nselects control actions but also decides whether to measure the latent state.\nThe measurement action reveals the true latent state but may have a negative\ndelayed effect on the environment. We show that this reduced uncertainty may\nprovably improve sample efficiency and increase the value of the optimal policy\ndespite these costs. We formulate an AOMDP as a periodic partially observable\nMDP and propose an online RL algorithm based on belief states. To approximate\nthe belief states, we further propose a sequential Monte Carlo method to\njointly approximate the posterior of unknown static environment parameters and\nunobserved latent states. We evaluate the proposed algorithm in a digital\nhealth application, where the agent decides when to deliver digital\ninterventions and when to assess users' health status through surveys.", "AI":

However, existing benchmarks designed to assess the reasoning\nabilities of large models tend to be limited in scope and lack the flexibility\nto adapt their difficulty according to the evolving reasoning capacities of the\nmodels. To address this, we propose MorphoBench, a benchmark that incorporates\nmultidisciplinary questions to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of large\nmodels and can adjust and update question difficulty based on the reasoning\nabilities of advanced models. Specifically, we curate the benchmark by\nselecting and collecting complex reasoning questions from existing benchmarks\nand sources such as Olympiad-level competitions. Additionally, MorphoBench\nadaptively modifies the analytical challenge of questions by leveraging key\nstatements generated during the model's reasoning process. Furthermore, it\nincludes questions generated using simulation software, enabling dynamic\nadjustment of benchmark difficulty with minimal resource consumption. We have\ngathered over 1,300 test questions and iteratively adjusted the difficulty of\nMorphoBench based on the reasoning capabilities of models such as o3 and GPT-5.\nMorphoBench enhances the comprehensiveness and validity of model reasoning\nevaluation, providing reliable guidance for improving both the reasoning\nabilities and scientific robustness of large models.

Existing methods either use a\npredetermined number of iterations or rely on confidence proxies that poorly\nreflect whether more retrieval will actually help. We cast iterative RAG as a\nfinite-horizon Markov decision process and introduce Stop-RAG, a value-based\ncontroller that adaptively decides when to stop retrieving. Trained with\nfull-width forward-view Q($\\lambda$) targets from complete trajectories,\nStop-RAG learns effective stopping policies while remaining compatible with\nblack-box APIs and existing pipelines. On multi-hop question-answering\nbenchmarks, Stop-RAG consistently outperforms both fixed-iteration baselines\nand prompting-based stopping with LLMs. These results highlight adaptive\nstopping as a key missing component in current agentic systems, and demonstrate\nthat value-based control can improve the accuracy of RAG systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Stop-RAG\ub294 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc911\uc9c0\ub97c \uacb0\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uac00\uce58 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc81c\uc5b4\uae30\ub85c, \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uac01 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc774 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc2dc\uac04\uacfc \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uc8fc\uc758\ub97c \ubd84\uc0b0\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc99d\uac70\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud560 \uc704\ud5d8\uc774 \uc788\uc5b4 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc911\uc9c0 \uc804\ub7b5\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "Stop-RAG\ub294 \uc720\ud55c \uc218\uba85\uc758 \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uacb0\uc815 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub85c \ubc18\ubcf5 RAG\ub97c \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uace0, \uac80\uc0c9\uc744 \uc911\ub2e8\ud560 \uc2dc\uc810\uc744 \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uacb0\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uac00\uce58 \uae30\ubc18 \uc81c\uc5b4\uae30\uc774\ub2e4.", "result": "Stop-RAG\ub294 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc9c8\ubb38-\uc751\ub2f5 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uace0\uc815 \ubc18\ubcf5 \uae30\uc900\uc120 \ubc0f LLM\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uc911\uc9c0\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Adaptive stopping\uc740 \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc8fc\uc694 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub85c \uac15\uc870\ub418\uba70, \uac00\uce58 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc81c\uc5b4\uac00 RAG \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubc18\ubcf5 \uac80\uc0c9 \uac15\ud654 \uc0dd\uc131(RAG)\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc5d0 \ub2f5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uac01 \ucd94\uac00 \ub8e8\ud504\ub294 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc2dc\uac04, \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uc8fc\uc758\uac00 \uc0b0\ub9cc\ud574\uc9c0\ub294 \uc99d\uac70\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud560 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc0ac\uc804 \uacb0\uc815\ub41c \ubc18\ubcf5 \ud69f\uc218\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc740 \uac80\uc0c9\uc774 \uc2e4\uc81c\ub85c \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc774 \ub420\uc9c0 \uc798 \ubc18\uc601\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub3c4 \ud504\ub85c\uc2dc\ub97c \uc758\uc874\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubc18\ubcf5 RAG\ub97c \uc720\ud55c \uc218\uba85\uc758 \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uacb0\uc815 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub85c \uc124\uc815\ud558\uace0, \uac80\uc0c9 \uc911\ub2e8 \uc2dc\uc810\uc744 \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uacb0\uc815\ud558\ub294 Stop-RAG\ub77c\ub294 \uac00\uce58 \uae30\ubc18 \uc81c\uc5b4\uae30\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc644\uc804\ud55c \uacbd\ub85c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc804\uccb4 \ud3ed \uc804\uc9c4 \ubcf4\uae30 Q(\u03bb) \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c Stop-RAG\ub294 \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 API \ubc0f \uae30\uc874 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uacfc\uc758 \ud638\ud658\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc911\uc9c0 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc9c8\ubb38-\uc751\ub2f5 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c Stop-RAG\ub294 \uace0\uc815 \ubc18\ubcf5 \uae30\uc900\uc120\uacfc LLM \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc911\uc9c0\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc801\uc751 \uc911\uc9c0\uac00 \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud575\uc2ec\uc801\uc778 \ub204\ub77d \uc694\uc18c\uc784\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uace0, \uac00\uce58 \uae30\ubc18 \uc81c\uc5b4\uac00 RAG \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Even when\nfine-tuning on benign data or with low-rank adaptation, pre-trained safety\nbehaviors are easily degraded, leading to harmful responses in the fine-tuned\nmodels. To address this challenge, we propose GuardSpace, a guardrail framework\nfor preserving safety alignment throughout fine-tuning, composed of two key\ncomponents: a safety-sensitive subspace and a harmful-resistant null space.\nFirst, we explicitly decompose pre-trained weights into safety-relevant and\nsafety-irrelevant components using covariance-preconditioned singular value\ndecomposition, and initialize low-rank adapters from the safety-irrelevant\nones, while freezing safety-relevant components to preserve their associated\nsafety mechanism. Second, we construct a null space projector that restricts\nadapter updates from altering safe outputs on harmful prompts, thereby\nmaintaining the original refusal behavior. Experiments with various pre-trained\nmodels on multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that GuardSpace achieves\nsuperior performance over existing methods. Notably, for Llama-2-7B-Chat\nfine-tuned on GSM8K, GuardSpace outperforms the state-of-the-art method AsFT,\nreducing the average harmful score from 14.4% to 3.6%, while improving the\naccuracy from

The framework has two complementary core mechanisms: an\nempirically derived transition reversibility measure called Phi of s and a, and\na selective state rollback operation. We introduce an online per state action\nestimator called Phi that quantifies the likelihood of returning to a prior\nstate within a fixed horizon K. This measure is used to adjust the penalty term\nduring temporal difference updates dynamically, integrating reversibility\nawareness directly into the value function. The system also includes a\nselective rollback operator. When an action yields an expected return markedly\nlower than its instantaneous estimated value and violates a predefined\nthreshold, the agent is penalized and returns to the preceding state rather\nthan progressing. This interrupts sub optimal high risk trajectories and avoids\ncatastrophic steps. By combining reversibility aware evaluation with targeted\nrollback, the method improves safety, performance, and stability. In the\nCliffWalking v0 domain, the framework reduced catastrophic falls by over 99.8\npercent and yielded a 55 percent increase in mean episode return.

While mainstream agentic RL algorithms autonomously explore\nhigh-uncertainty tool-call steps under the guidance of entropy, excessive\nreliance on entropy signals can impose further constraints, leading to the\ntraining collapse. In this paper, we delve into the challenges caused by\nentropy and propose the Agentic Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization (AEPO), an\nagentic RL algorithm designed to balance entropy in both the rollout and policy\nupdate phases. AEPO comprises two core components: (1) a dynamic\nentropy-balanced rollout mechanism that adaptively allocate global and branch\nsampling budget through entropy pre-monitoring, while imposing a branch penalty\non consecutive high-entropy tool-call steps to prevent over-branching issues;\nand (2) Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization that inserts a stop-gradient\noperation into the high-entropy clipping term to preserve and properly rescale\ngradients on high-entropy tokens, while incorporating entropy-aware advantage\nestimation to prioritize learning on high-uncertainty tokens. Results across 14\nchallenging datasets show that AEPO consistently outperforms 7 mainstream RL\nalgorithms. With just 1K RL samples, Qwen3-14B with AEPO achieves impressive\nresults: 47.6% on GAIA, 11.2% on Humanity's Last Exam, and 43.0% on WebWalker\nfor Pass@1; 65.0% on GAIA, 26.0% on Humanity's Last Exam, and 70.0% on\nWebWalker for Pass@5.

In this paper, we\npresent MASC, a metacognitive framework that endows MAS with real-time,\nunsupervised, step-level error detection and self-correction. MASC rethinks\ndetection as history-conditioned anomaly scoring via two complementary designs:\n(1) Next-Execution Reconstruction, which predicts the embedding of the next\nstep from the query and interaction history to capture causal consistency, and\n(2) Prototype-Guided Enhancement, which learns a prototype prior over\nnormal-step embeddings and uses it to stabilize reconstruction and anomaly\nscoring under sparse context (e.g., early steps). When an anomaly step is\nflagged, MASC triggers a correction agent to revise the acting agent's output\nbefore information flows downstream.

We\nargue that a truly intelligent and helpful assistant should be capable of\nanticipating user needs and taking actions proactively when appropriate. To\nrealize this vision, we propose Alpha-Service, a unified framework that\naddresses two fundamental challenges: Know When to intervene by detecting\nservice opportunities from egocentric video streams, and Know How to provide\nboth generalized and personalized services. Inspired by the von Neumann\ncomputer architecture and based on AI glasses, Alpha-Service consists of five\nkey components: an Input Unit for perception, a Central Processing Unit for\ntask scheduling, an Arithmetic Logic Unit for tool utilization, a Memory Unit\nfor long-term personalization, and an Output Unit for natural human\ninteraction. As an initial exploration, we implement Alpha-Service through a\nmulti-agent system deployed on AI glasses.

In real-world scenarios, however,\nclients often have heterogeneous computational resources and hold\nnon-independent and identically distributed data (non-IID), which poses\nsignificant challenges during training. Personalized Federated Learning (PFL)\nhas emerged to address these issues by customizing models for each client based\non their unique data distribution. Despite its potential, existing PFL\napproaches typically overlook the coexistence of model and data heterogeneity\narising from clients with diverse computational capabilities. To overcome this\nlimitation, we propose a novel method, called Progressive Parameter Alignment\n(FedPPA), which progressively aligns the weights of common layers across\nclients with the global model's weights. Our approach not only mitigates\ninconsistencies between global and local models during client updates, but also\npreserves client's local knowledge, thereby enhancing personalization\nrobustness in non-IID settings.

While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise, most\nexisting approaches rely on direct state-to-action mappings, which lack\nstructured reasoning and planning, and thus generalize poorly to novel tasks or\nunseen UI layouts. We introduce Hi-Agent, a trainable hierarchical\nvision-language agent for mobile control, featuring a high-level reasoning\nmodel and a low-level action model that are jointly optimized. For efficient\ntraining, we reformulate multi-step decision-making as a sequence of\nsingle-step subgoals and propose a foresight advantage function, which\nleverages execution feedback from the low-level model to guide high-level\noptimization. This design alleviates the path explosion issue encountered by\nGroup Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in long-horizon tasks and enables\nstable, critic-free joint training.

For example, even with carefully designed prompts and prior\ninformation explicitly provided, GPT-4o achieves only a 7% Final Pass Rate on\nthe TravelPlanner dataset in the sole-planning mode. Similarly, even in the\nthinking mode, Qwen3-8B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-671B, only achieve Final Pass\nRates of 5.9% and 40%, respectively. Although well-organized Multi-Agent\nSystems (MAS) can offer improved collective reasoning, they often suffer from\nhigh reasoning costs due to multi-round internal interactions, long\nper-response latency, and difficulties in end-to-end training. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a general and scalable framework called IMAGINE, short\nfor Integrating Multi-Agent System into One Model. This framework not only\nintegrates the reasoning and planning capabilities of MAS into a single,\ncompact model, but also significantly surpass the capabilities of the MAS\nthrough a simple end-to-end training. Through this pipeline, a single\nsmall-scale model is not only able to acquire the structured reasoning and\nplanning capabilities of a well-organized MAS but can also significantly\noutperform it. Experimental results demonstrate that, when using\nQwen3-8B-Instruct as the base model and training it with our method, the model\nachieves an 82.7% Final Pass Rate on the TravelPlanner benchmark, far

For this, we modified the A* algorithm, A-UCB*, by\nincorporating acquisition values into trajectory costs, leading to\nhigh-acquisition planned paths.

The need to select,\ncombine, and tune strategies for multifaceted challenges like data\nheterogeneity and system constraints has become a critical bottleneck,\nresulting in brittle, bespoke solutions. To address this, we introduce\nHelmsman, a novel multi-agent system that automates the end-to-end synthesis of\nfederated learning systems from high-level user specifications. It emulates a\nprincipled research and development workflow through three collaborative\nphases: (1) interactive human-in-the-loop planning to formulate a sound\nresearch plan, (2) modular code generation by supervised agent teams, and (3) a\nclosed-loop of autonomous evaluation and refinement in a sandboxed simulation\nenvironment. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we also introduce\nAgentFL-Bench, a new benchmark comprising 16 diverse tasks designed to assess\nthe system-level generation capabilities of agentic systems in FL.

Today's\napplications often require LLMs to interact with external tools, marking a\nshift toward more complex agentic systems. To support this, standards such as\nthe Model Context Protocol (MCP) have emerged, enabling agents to access tools\nby including a specification of the capabilities of each tool within the\nprompt. Although this approach expands what agents can do, it also introduces a\ngrowing problem: prompt bloating. As the number of tools increases, the prompts\nbecome longer, leading to high prompt token costs, increased latency, and\nreduced task success resulting from the selection of tools irrelevant to the\nprompt. To address this issue, we introduce JSPLIT, a taxonomy-driven framework\ndesigned to help agents manage prompt size more effectively when using large\nsets of MCP tools. JSPLIT organizes the tools into a hierarchical taxonomy and\nuses the user's prompt to identify and include only the most relevant tools,\nbased on both the query and the taxonomy structure. In this paper, we describe\nthe design of the taxonomy, the tool selection algorithm, and the dataset used\nto evaluate JSPLIT. Our results show that JSPLIT significantly reduces prompt\nsize without significantly compromising the agent's ability to respond\neffectively. As the number of available tools for the agent grows\nsubstantially, JSPLIT even improves the tool selection accuracy of the agent,\neffectively reducing costs while simultaneously improving task success in\nhigh-complexity agent environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubc1c\uc804\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uae30\ub300 \ub610\ud55c \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\uc81c LLM(\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378)\uc740 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ub118\uc5b4 \uc678\ubd80 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc640 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc218\uac00 \ub298\uc5b4\ub0a8\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\uc758 \uae38\uc774\uac00 \uae38\uc5b4\uc9c0\ub294 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ud33d\ucc3d\uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \ub3c4\uad6c\ub4e4\uc744 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ubd84\ub958\uccb4\uacc4\ub85c \uc870\uc9c1\ud558\uace0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uac00\uc7a5 \uad00\ub828\uc131 \ub192\uc740 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub9cc \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc124\uacc4\ud55c JSPLIT\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.

Source\n  code available at https://github.com/corazza/srm", "summary": "Reward machines are an established tool for dealing with reinforcement\nlearning problems in which rewards are sparse and depend on complex sequences\nof actions. However, existing algorithms for learning reward machines assume an\noverly idealized setting where rewards have to be free of noise. To overcome\nthis practical limitation, we introduce a novel type of reward machines, called\nstochastic reward machines, and an algorithm for learning them.

However,\nreal-world mobile tasks are often complex and allow for multiple valid\nsolutions. This contradicts current mobile agent evaluation standards: offline\nstatic benchmarks can only validate a single predefined \"golden path\", while\nonline dynamic testing is constrained by the complexity and non-reproducibility\nof real devices, making both approaches inadequate for comprehensively\nassessing agent capabilities. To bridge the gap between offline and online\nevaluation and enhance testing stability, this paper introduces a novel\ngraph-structured benchmarking framework. By modeling the finite states observed\nduring real-device interactions, it achieves static simulation of dynamic\nbehaviors. Building on this, we develop ColorBench, a benchmark focused on\ncomplex long-horizon tasks. It supports evaluation of multiple valid solutions,\nsubtask completion rate statistics, and atomic-level capability analysis.\nColorBench contains 175 tasks (74 single-app, 101 cross-app) with an average\nlength of over 13 steps. Each task includes at least two correct paths and\nseveral typical error paths, enabling quasi-dynamic interaction. By evaluating\nColorBench across various baselines, we discover limitations of existing models\nand propose improvement directions and feasible technical pathways to enhance\nagents' performance on complex, long-horizon problems based on experimental\nresults.

However, nearly all of sequential decision-making theory assumes that\nall errors are recoverable (e.g., by bounding rewards). Standard bandit\nalgorithms that explore aggressively may cause irreparable damage when this\nassumption fails. Some prior work avoids irreparable errors by asking for help\nfrom a mentor, but a mentor may not always be available. In this work, we\nformalize a model of learning with unbounded rewards without a mentor as a\ntwo-action contextual bandit with an abstain option: at each round the agent\nobserves an input and chooses either to abstain (always 0 reward) or to commit\n(execute a preexisting task policy). Committing yields rewards that are\nupper-bounded but can be arbitrarily negative, and the commit reward is assumed\nLipschitz in the input. We propose a caution-based algorithm that learns when\nnot to learn: it chooses a trusted region and commits only where the available\nevidence does not already certify harm. Under these conditions and i.i.d.\ninputs, we establish sublinear regret guarantees, theoretically demonstrating\nthe effectiveness of cautious exploration for deploying learning agents safely\nin

Meanwhile, inference scaling\nhas become a cutting-edge technique to enhance LLM performance by allocating\nmore computational resources during the inference process. However, current\nresearch on inference scaling primarily focuses on unstructured output\ngeneration tasks, leaving its application in structured outputs, like function\ncalling, largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose an inference\nscaling framework that combines fine-grained beam search with a process reward\nmodel, ToolPRM, which scores the internal steps of each single function call.\nTo train ToolPRM, we construct the first fine-grained intra-call process\nsupervision dataset, automatically annotated with function-masking techniques\nto provide step-level rewards for structured tool-use reasoning. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that ToolPRM beats the coarse-grained and outcome\nreward models in terms of predictive accuracy, indicating its stronger\ncapability in supervising the function calling inference process. Inference\nscaling technique equipped with ToolPRM also significantly improves the\nbackbone model performance across various function calling tasks and\nbenchmarks. More importantly, we reveal a key principle for applying inference\nscaling techniques to structured outputs: \"explore more but retain less\" due to\nthe unrecoverability characteristics of structured function calling generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud568\uc218 \ud638\ucd9c\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ucd9c\ub825\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ud655\uc7a5 \uc751\uc6a9 \ubd80\uc871\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 ToolPRM\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub2e8\uacc4\ubcc4 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud604\uc7ac \ucd94\ub860 \ud655\uc7a5 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ube44\uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ucd9c\ub825 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uc8fc\ub85c \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uace0 \uc788\uc5b4 \ud568\uc218 \ud638\ucd9c\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ucd9c\ub825\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc751\uc6a9\uc774 \uac70\uc758 \ud0d0\uc0c9\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc138\ubc00\ud55c \ube54 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uacfc \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubaa8\ub378\uc778 ToolPRM\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \ud655\uc7a5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

We show\nthat averaging TVD-MI's binary trials yields centered-probability scores with\nadditive structure suitable for item-response theory (IRT) without nonlinear\nlink functions. Maximum-likelihood approaches to IRT use logistic links, but we\nfind empirically that these transformations introduce curvature that breaks\nadditivity: across three domains, the identity link yields median curl on raw\ndata of 0.080-0.150 (P95 = [0.474, 0.580]), whereas probit/logit introduce\nsubstantially higher violations (median [0.245, 0.588], P95 [0.825, 2.252]). We\nderive this clipped-linear model from Gini entropy maximization, yielding a\nbox-constrained least-squares formulation that handles boundary saturation. At\n33% coverage, we achieve holdout RMSE $0.117 \\pm 0.008$ while preserving agent\nrankings (Spearman $\\rho = 0.972 \\pm 0.015$), three times fewer evaluations\nthan full dense.

However, prevailing\nRLVR methods exhibit a systematic bias toward exploitation over exploration, as\nevidenced by improved pass@1 but reduced pass@K (K>1) performance. To\nunderstand this issue, we analyze training dynamics of RLVR methods by tracking\nthe token-level probability distributions over vocabulary candidates. Our\nanalysis reveals a consistent probability concentration effect where the top-1\ncandidate increasingly accumulates probability mass and suppresses that of\nother candidates. More importantly, stronger over-concentration correlates with\nworse pass@K performance. Inspired by this finding, we propose Simple Pass@K\nOptimization (SimKO), a method designed to mitigate the over-concentration\nissue, thereby encouraging exploration. SimKO operates in an asymmetrical\nmanner. For verified-correct responses, it boosts the probabilities of the\ntop-K candidates. For verified-incorrect responses, it applies stronger\npenalties to the top-1 candidate. We observe that this asymmetric design is\nparticularly effective at mitigating over-concentration when applied at tokens\nwith high entropy. Across various math and logical-reasoning benchmarks, SimKO\nconsistently yields higher pass@K for a wide range of K, providing a simple way\nto improve RLVR's exploration.", "AI": {"tldr": "RLVR \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ud0d0\uc0c9\ubcf4\ub2e4\ub294 \ud65c\uc6a9\uc5d0 \ud3b8\ud5a5\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud574\uacb0\ucc45\uc73c\ub85c SimKO\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "RLVR \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc5ec \uc790\uc6d0 \ud65c\uc6a9\uacfc \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uac04\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "SimKO\ub294 \uc0c1\ube44\ub300 \uc751\ub2f5\uc5d0\uc11c top-K \ud6c4\ubcf4\uc758 \ud655\ub960\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0, \ud2c0\ub9b0 \uc751\ub2f5\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 top-1 \ud6c4\ubcf4\uc5d0 \ub354 \uac15\ud55c \ud328\ub110\ud2f0\ub97c \uc801\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "SimKO\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc218\ud559 \ubc0f \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c K\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 consistently \ub192\uc740 pass@K\ub97c \uae30\ub85d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "SimKO\ub294 RLVR\uc758 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \uac16\ub294 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RLVR)\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf30\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874\uc758 RLVR \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ud0d0\uc0c9\ubcf4\ub2e4\ub294 \ud65c\uc6a9\uc5d0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc801 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, pass@1 \uc131\ub2a5\uc740 \uac1c\uc120\ub418\uc9c0\ub9cc pass@K(K>1) \uc131\ub2a5\uc740 \uac10\uc18c\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc774\ud574\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5b4\ud718 \ud6c4\ubcf4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud1a0\ud070 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ud655\ub960 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \ucd94\uc801\ud558\uc5ec RLVR \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubd84\uc11d \uacb0\uacfc, top-1 \ud6c4\ubcf4\uac00 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc740 \ud655\ub960 \uc9c8\ub7c9\uc744 \ucd95\uc801\ud558\uace0 \ub2e4\ub978 \ud6c4\ubcf4\uc758 \ud655\ub960\uc744 \uc5b5\uc555\ud558\ub294 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \ud655\ub960 \uc9d1\uc911 \ud6a8\uacfc\uac00 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0ac\ub2e4. \ub354 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uac83\uc740, \ub354 \uac15\ud55c \uacfc\ub3c4\ud55c \uc9d1\uc911\uc774 \ub0ae\uc740 pass@K \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubc1c\uacac\uc5d0 \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc544, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uacfc\ub3c4\ud55c \uc9d1\uc911 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc644\ud654\ud558\uace0 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 Simple Pass@K Optimization (SimKO) \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

Traditional genotype-to-phenotype (G2P) models depend\nheavily on direct mappings that achieve only modest accuracy, forcing breeders\nto conduct large, costly field trials to maintain or marginally improve genetic\ngain. Models that incorporate intermediate molecular phenotypes such as gene\nexpression can achieve higher predictive fit, but they remain impractical for\nGS since such data are unavailable at deployment or design time. BINNs overcome\nthis limitation by encoding pathway-level inductive biases and leveraging\nmulti-omics data only during training, while using genotype data alone during\ninference. Applied to maize gene-expression and multi-environment field-trial\ndata, BINN improves rank-correlation accuracy by up to 56% within and across\nsubpopulations under sparse-data conditions and nonlinearly identifies genes\nthat GWAS/TWAS fail to uncover. With complete domain knowledge for a synthetic\nmetabolomics benchmark, BINN reduces prediction error by 75% relative to\nconventional neural nets and correctly identifies the most important nonlinear\npathway. Importantly, both cases show highly sensitive BINN latent variables\ncorrelate with the experimental quantities they represent, despite not being\ntrained on them.

Using LLMs to\nperform NL2SQL methods on a large collection of SQL databases necessitates\nprocessing large quantities of meta-information about the databases, which in\nturn results in lengthy prompts with many tokens and high processing costs. To\naddress this challenge, we introduce Datalake Agent, an agentic system designed\nto enable an LLM to solve NL2SQL tasks more efficiently. Instead of utilizing\ndirect solvers for NL2SQL that call the LLM once with all meta-information in\nthe prompt, the Datalake Agent employs an interactive loop to reduce the\nutilized meta-information. Within the loop, the LLM is used in a reasoning\nframework that selectively requests only the necessary information to solve a\ntable question answering task. We evaluate the Datalake Agent on a collection\nof 23 databases with 100 table question answering tasks.

Despite the success of large language models and vision language\nmodels based on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) in planning tasks, they continue\nfacing challenges in performing long-horizon manipulation tasks in complex\nreal-world environments, owing to their restricted common sense and reasoning\ncapabilities. Considering that aligning general-purpose vision language models\nto robotic planning tasks via supervised fine-tuning suffers from poor\ngeneralization and insufficient physical understanding, we propose RoboGPT-R1,\na two-stage fine-tuning framework for embodied planning. In this framework,\nsupervised training acquires foundational knowledge through expert sequences,\nfollowed by RL to address the model's shortcomings in visual-spatial\nunderstanding and reasoning. To achieve physical understanding and action\nsequence consistency in multi-step reasoning tasks, we design a rule-based\nreward function that simultaneously considers long-horizon performance and\naction constraint in the environment. The reasoning model, trained on\nQwen2.5-VL-3B, significantly outperforms the larger-scale model, GPT-4o-mini,\nby 21.33% and surpasses other work trained on Qwen2.5-VL-7B by 20.33% on the\nEmbodiedBench benchmark.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub85c\ubd07\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc778\uac04 \uc9c0\uc2dc\uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 RoboGPT-R1\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ub450 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc758 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc778\uac04 \uc9c0\uc2dc\uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc644\ub8cc\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uad6c\uccb4\ud654\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "RoboGPT-R1\uc740 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \uac10\ub3c5 \ud559\uc2b5\uacfc RL\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \ub450 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc758 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "result": "\uac1c\ubc1c\ub41c \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 EmbodiedBench \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c GPT-4o-mini\ubcf4\ub2e4 21.33% \uc6b0\uc218\ud558\uace0 Qwen2.5-VL-7B\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ub2e4\ub978 \uc791\uc5c5\ubcf4\ub2e4 20.33% \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub85c\ubd07\uc758 \uc2dc\uac01-\uacf5\uac04 \uc774\ud574\uc640 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud0d0\uc0c9\ub41c \uc0ac\uc804 \uc815\ubcf4\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc778\uac04 \uc9c0\uc2dc\uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ud589\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uad6c\uccb4\ud654\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac10\ub3c5 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815(SFT)\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ube44\uc804 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uacc4\ud68d \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\uacf5\uc744 \uac70\ub450\uc5c8\uc74c\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \uadf8\ub4e4\uc740 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc0c1\uc2dd\uacfc \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud604\uc2e4 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc7a5\uae30 \uc870\uc791 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc77c\ubc18 \ubaa9\uc801\uc758 \ube44\uc804 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ub85c\ubd07 \uacc4\ud68d \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 align\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\uc758 \ubd80\uc871\uacfc \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc774\ud574\uc758 \ubd80\uc871\uc73c\ub85c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc744 \uac10\uc548\ud558\uc5ec, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uad6c\uccb4\uc801 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ub450 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc758 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 RoboGPT-R1\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uae30\ucd08 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc2b5\ub4dd\ud55c \ud6c4 RL\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc2dc\uac01-\uacf5\uac04 \uc774\ud574\uc640 \ucd94\ub860\uc758 \ub2e8\uc810\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ucd94\ub860 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc774\ud574\uc640 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc7a5\uae30 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \ud658\uacbd \ub0b4 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uace0\ub824\ud558\ub294 \uaddc\uce59 \uae30\ubc18 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \uc124\uacc4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, the effectiveness of search depends on where\nto search, namely, how to encode the domain prior into an operationally\nstructured hypothesis space. To this end, this paper proposes a compact formal\ntheory that describes and measures LLM-assisted iterative search guided by\ndomain priors. We represent an agent as a fuzzy relation operator on inputs and\noutputs to capture feasible transitions; the agent is thereby constrained by a\nfixed safety envelope. To describe multi-step reasoning/search, we weight all\nreachable paths by a single continuation parameter and sum them to obtain a\ncoverage generating function; this induces a measure of reachability\ndifficulty; and it provides a geometric interpretation of search on the graph\ninduced by the safety envelope. We further provide the simplest testable\ninferences and validate them via a majority-vote instantiation.

To address these challenges, we introduce the\nGatekeeper Protocol, a novel, domain-agnostic framework that governs\nagent-system interactions.

All\ninteractions are mediated through a unified JSON format that serves as a\ndeclarative, state-synchronized protocol, ensuring the agent's model of the\nsystem remains verifiably grounded in the system's reality. We demonstrate the\nefficacy of this protocol with Sage, a reference implementation of the\nGatekeeper Protocol for software development.

Prior work has explored unimodal and multimodal\napproaches, with multimodal systems showing promise by leveraging complementary\nsignals. However, existing studies are limited in scope, lack systematic\ncomparisons of features, and suffer from inconsistent evaluation protocols. We\naddress these gaps by systematically exploring feature representations and\nmodelling strategies across EEG, together with speech and text. We evaluate\nhandcrafted features versus pre-trained embeddings, assess the effectiveness of\ndifferent neural encoders, compare unimodal, bimodal, and trimodal\nconfigurations, and analyse fusion strategies with attention to the role of\nEEG. Consistent subject-independent splits are applied to ensure robust,\nreproducible benchmarking. Our results show that (i) the combination of EEG,\nspeech and text modalities enhances multimodal detection, (ii) pretrained\nembeddings outperform handcrafted features, and (iii) carefully designed\ntrimodal models achieve state-of-the-art performance.

We formalize this intuition via a composite instability\nindex (H-Risk) combining spectral margin, conditioning, temporal sensitivity,\nand innovation amplification. In linear-Gaussian simulations, higher H-Risk\npredicts overconfident errors even under formal stability, revealing a gap\nbetween nominal and epistemic stability. Extending to large language models\n(LLMs), we find that fragile internal dynamics correlate with miscalibration\nand hallucination, while critique-style prompts show mixed effects on\ncalibration and hallucination. These results suggest a structural bridge\nbetween Kantian self-limitation and feedback control, offering a principled\nlens for diagnosing -- and selectively reducing -- overconfidence in reasoning\nsystems.

Given recent advances in large\nlanguage models (LLMs), we ask whether they, too, can learn to create. We\napproach this question through the lens of compositional machine design: a task\nin which machines are assembled from standardized components to meet functional\ndemands like locomotion or manipulation in a simulated physical environment. To\nsupport this investigation, we introduce BesiegeField, a testbed built on the\nmachine-building game Besiege, which enables part-based construction, physical\nsimulation and reward-driven evaluation. Using BesiegeField, we benchmark\nstate-of-the-art LLMs with agentic workflows and identify key capabilities\nrequired for success, including spatial reasoning, strategic assembly, and\ninstruction-following. As current open-source models fall short, we explore\nreinforcement learning (RL) as a path to improvement: we curate a cold-start\ndataset, conduct RL finetuning experiments, and highlight open challenges at\nthe intersection of language, machine design, and physical reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ucd5c\uadfc \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uc774 \uae30\uacc4 \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uace0 \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uae30\uacc4 \uc124\uacc4\ub294 \uc778\uac04 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc758 \uae30\uc900\uc774\uc790 \uacf5\ud559 \uc2e4\uc2b5\uc758 \uae30\ucd08\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\uae30\uacc4 \uc124\uacc4\uc758 \uc870\ud569\uc801 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574, \ud45c\uc900\ud654\ub41c \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \uc870\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\ub2a5\uc801 \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \ucda9\uc871\ud558\ub294 \uae30\uacc4\ub97c \uc870\ub9bd\ud558\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud574 BesiegeField\ub77c\ub294 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ubca0\ub4dc \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ucd5c\uc2e0 LLM\uc744 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud0b9\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\uacf5\uac04 \ucd94\ub860, \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \uc870\ub9bd, \uc9c0\uce68 \ub530\ub974\uae30 \ub4f1 \uc131\uacf5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc8fc\uc694 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uc624\ud508 \uc18c\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud55c \uc810\uc744 \ubcf4\uc644\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac1c\uc120 \ubc29\uc548\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uae30\uacc4\uc758 \uc124\uacc4\ub294 \uc778\uac04 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc758 \ud45c\uc2dd\uc774\uc790 \uacf5\ud559 \uc2e4\uc2b5\uc758 \uae30\ucd08\ub85c \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \uac10\uc548\ud560 \ub54c, \uc774\ub4e4 \ub610\ud55c \ucc3d\uc870\ud558\ub294 \ubc95\uc744 \ubc30\uc6b8 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0 \uc9c8\ubb38\ud558\uac8c \ub41c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uae30\uacc4\uac00 \ud45c\uc900\ud654\ub41c \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub85c \uc870\ub9bd\ub418\uc5b4 \ubaa8\uc758 \ubb3c\ub9ac \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b4\ub3d9\uc774\ub098 \uc870\uc791\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uae30\ub2a5\uc801 \uc694\uad6c\ub97c \ucda9\uc871\ud558\ub294 \uc870\ud569\uc801 \uae30\uacc4 \uc124\uacc4\uc758 \uad00\uc810\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc811\uadfc\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc870\uc0ac\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubd80\ud488 \uae30\ubc18 \uac74\uc124, \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ubc0f \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uae30\ubc18 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 Besiege\ub77c\ub294 \uae30\uacc4 \uad6c\ucd95 \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ubca0\ub4dc\uc778 BesiegeField\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.
