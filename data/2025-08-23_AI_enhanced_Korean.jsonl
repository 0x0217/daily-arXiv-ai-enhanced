Language-model-driven agents\noffer a natural interface for these tasks, but existing approaches often lack\nscalability, reliability, and human oversight. We introduce the Alpha Berkeley\nFramework, a production-ready architecture for scalable agentic systems that\nintegrate conversational context with robust tool orchestration. The framework\nfeatures dynamic capability classification to select only relevant tools per\ntask, a plan-first orchestration model that generates execution plans with\nexplicit dependencies and optional human approval, context-aware task\nextraction that combines dialogue history with external memory and domain\nresources, and production-ready execution environments with checkpointing,\nartifact management, and modular deployment. We demonstrate its versatility\nthrough two case studies: a tutorial-style wind farm monitoring example and a\ndeployment at the Advanced Light Source particle accelerator.

This design\nprioritizes qualitative reasoning over brittle numerical estimates, preserves\nglobal constraints (e.g., alignment, connectivity), and naturally supports\nhuman-in-the-loop corrections. On 10 sketches derived from flowcharts in\npublished papers, our method more faithfully reconstructs layout and structure\nthan two frontier closed-source image generation LLMs (GPT-5 and\nGemini-2.5-Pro), accurately composing primitives (e.g., multi-headed arrows)\nwithout inserting unwanted text. Because outputs are programmatic SVGs, the\napproach is readily extensible to presentation tools (e.g., PowerPoint) via\nAPIs and can be specialized with improved prompts and task-specific tools.

The current approach is to design a memory\nmodule for the agent to process these data. However, existing methods, such as\nMemoryBank and A-MEM, have poor quality of stored memory content, which affects\nrecall performance and response quality. In order to better construct\nhigh-quality long-term memory content, we have designed a multiple memory\nsystem (MMS) inspired by cognitive psychology theory. The system processes\nshort-term memory to multiple long-term memory fragments, and constructs\nretrieval memory units and contextual memory units based on these fragments,\nwith a one-to-one correspondence between the two. During the retrieval phase,\nMMS will match the most relevant retrieval memory units based on the user's\nquery. Then, the corresponding contextual memory units is obtained as the\ncontext for the response stage to enhance knowledge, thereby effectively\nutilizing historical data.

However, it creates novel\nattack surfaces due to untrusted external tools. While prior work has focused\non attacks injected through external tool outputs, we investigate a more\nfundamental vulnerability: Tool Poisoning, where malicious instructions are\nembedded within a tool's metadata without execution. To date, this threat has\nbeen primarily demonstrated through isolated cases, lacking a systematic,\nlarge-scale evaluation.\n  We introduce MCPTox, the first benchmark to systematically evaluate agent\nrobustness against Tool Poisoning in realistic MCP settings. MCPTox is\nconstructed upon 45 live, real-world MCP servers and 353 authentic tools. To\nachieve this, we design three distinct attack templates to generate a\ncomprehensive suite of 1312 malicious test cases by few-shot learning, covering\n10 categories of potential risks. Our evaluation on 20 prominent LLM agents\nsetting reveals a widespread vulnerability to Tool Poisoning, with o1-mini,\nachieving an attack success rate of 72.8\\%. We find that more capable models\nare often more susceptible, as the attack exploits their superior\ninstruction-following abilities. Finally, the failure case analysis reveals\nthat agents rarely refuse these attacks, with the highest refused rate\n(Claude-3.7-Sonnet) less than 3\\%, demonstrating that existing safety alignment\nis ineffective against malicious actions that use legitimate tools for\nunauthorized operation.

Here,\nwe present a hierarchical Safe Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL) framework that\nexplicitly integrates moral considerations with standard driving objectives. At\nthe decision level, a Safe RL agent is trained using a composite ethical risk\ncost, combining collision probability and harm severity, to generate high-level\nmotion targets. A dynamic Prioritized Experience Replay mechanism amplifies\nlearning from rare but critical, high-risk events. At the execution level,\npolynomial path planning coupled with Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID)\nand Stanley controllers translates these targets into smooth, feasible\ntrajectories, ensuring both accuracy and comfort. We train and validate our\napproach on rich, real-world traffic datasets encompassing diverse vehicles,\ncyclists, and pedestrians, and demonstrate that it outperforms baseline methods\nin reducing ethical risk and maintaining driving performance. To our knowledge,\nthis is the first study of ethical decision-making for autonomous vehicles via\nSafe RL in real-world scenarios. Our results highlight the potential of\ncombining formal control theory and data-driven learning to advance ethically\naccountable autonomy in complex, human-mixed traffic environments.", "AI":

While prior\nwork typically evaluates overall team performance based on explicit reward\nsignals or learned value functions, it is unclear how to infer agent\ncontributions in the absence of any value feedback. In this work, we\ninvestigate whether meaningful insights into agent behaviors can be extracted\nthat are consistent with the underlying value functions, solely by analyzing\nthe policy distribution. Inspired by the phenomenon that intelligent agents\ntend to pursue convergent instrumental values, which generally increase the\nlikelihood of task success, we introduce Intended Cooperation Values (ICVs), a\nmethod based on information-theoretic Shapley values for quantifying each\nagent's causal influence on their co-players' instrumental empowerment.\nSpecifically, ICVs measure an agent's action effect on its teammates' policies\nby assessing their decision uncertainty and preference alignment.

To address this, we propose a personalized lung\ncancer risk prediction agent that dynamically selects the most appropriate\nmodel for each patient by combining cohort-specific knowledge with modern\nretrieval and reasoning techniques. Given a patient's CT scan and structured\nmetadata -- including demographic, clinical, and nodule-level features -- the\nagent first performs cohort retrieval using FAISS-based similarity search\nacross nine diverse real-world cohorts to identify the most relevant patient\npopulation from a multi-institutional database. Second, a Large Language Model\n(LLM) is prompted with the retrieved cohort and its associated performance\nmetrics to recommend the optimal prediction algorithm from a pool of eight\nrepresentative models, including classical linear risk models (e.g., Mayo,\nBrock), temporally-aware models (e.g., TDVIT, DLSTM), and multi-modal computer\nvision-based approaches (e.g., Liao, Sybil, DLS, DLI). This two-stage agent\npipeline -- retrieval via FAISS and reasoning via LLM -- enables dynamic,\ncohort-aware risk prediction personalized to each patient's profile.

Its\nacquisition is often believed to rely on world models, comprising both\ndescriptive (what is) and prescriptive (what is desirable) aspects that\nidentify and evaluate state of affairs in the world, respectively. Canonical\ncomputational accounts of purposeful behavior, such as reinforcement learning,\nposit distinct components of a world model comprising a state representation\n(descriptive aspect) and a reward function (prescriptive aspect). However, an\nalternative possibility, which has not yet been computationally formulated, is\nthat these two aspects instead co-emerge interdependently from an agent's goal.\nHere, we describe a computational framework of goal-directed state\nrepresentation in cognitive agents, in which the descriptive and prescriptive\naspects of a world model co-emerge from agent-environment interaction\nsequences, or experiences. Drawing on Buddhist epistemology, we introduce a\nconstruct of goal-directed, or telic, states, defined as classes of\ngoal-equivalent experience distributions. Telic states provide a parsimonious\naccount of goal-directed learning in terms of the statistical divergence\nbetween behavioral policies and desirable experience features.

Traditional approaches treat these\ndimensions independently and lack interpretability, while recent automated\nmethods struggle with dynamic adaptability and semantic reasoning about\noptimization decisions. We introduce Language-Guided Tuning (LGT), a novel\nframework that employs multi-agent Large Language Models to intelligently\noptimize configurations through natural language reasoning. We apply textual\ngradients - qualitative feedback signals that complement numerical optimization\nby providing semantic understanding of training dynamics and configuration\ninterdependencies. LGT coordinates three specialized agents: an Advisor that\nproposes configuration changes, an Evaluator that assesses progress, and an\nOptimizer that refines the decision-making process, creating a self-improving\nfeedback loop.

As these models continue to scale\nexplosively for performance, implementation efficiency remains a critical\nchallenge. Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures, selectively activating\nspecialized subnetworks (experts), offer a unique balance between model\naccuracy and computational cost. However, the adaptive routing in MoE\narchitectures, where input tokens are dynamically directed to specialized\nexperts based on their semantic meaning inadvertently opens up a new attack\nsurface for privacy breaches. These input-dependent activation patterns leave\ndistinctive temporal and spatial traces in hardware execution, which\nadversaries could exploit to deduce sensitive user data. In this work, we\npropose MoEcho, discovering a side channel analysis based attack surface that\ncompromises user privacy on MoE based systems. Specifically, in MoEcho, we\nintroduce four novel architectural side channels on different computing\nplatforms, including Cache Occupancy Channels and Pageout+Reload on CPUs, and\nPerformance Counter and TLB Evict+Reload on GPUs, respectively. Exploiting\nthese vulnerabilities, we propose four attacks that effectively breach user\nprivacy in large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs) based\non MoE architectures: Prompt Inference Attack, Response Reconstruction Attack,\nVisual Inference Attack, and Visual Reconstruction Attack. MoEcho is the first\nruntime architecture level security analysis of the popular MoE structure\ncommon in modern transformers, highlighting a serious security and privacy\nthreat and calling for effective and timely safeguards when harnessing MoE\nbased models for developing efficient large scale AI services.", "AI": {"tldr": "Mixture of Experts(MoE) \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc758

It proposes a unified prediction framework that integrates\nstructural perception and temporal modeling. The method leverages graph neural\nnetworks to model the structural relationships among multimodal clinical\nsymptoms and introduces graph-based representations to capture semantic\ndependencies between symptoms. It also incorporates a Transformer architecture\nto model dynamic temporal features during disease progression. To fuse\nstructural and temporal information, a structure-aware gating mechanism is\ndesigned to dynamically adjust the fusion weights between structural encodings\nand temporal features, enhancing the model's ability to identify key\nprogression stages. To improve classification accuracy and stability, the\nframework includes a multi-component modeling pipeline, consisting of a graph\nconstruction module, a temporal encoding module, and a prediction output layer.\nThe model is evaluated on real-world longitudinal Parkinson's disease data. The\nexperiments involve comparisons with mainstream models, sensitivity analysis of\nhyperparameters, and graph connection density control. Results show that the\nproposed method outperforms existing approaches in AUC, RMSE, and IPW-F1\nmetrics. It effectively distinguishes progression stages and improves the\nmodel's ability to capture personalized symptom trajectories. The overall\nframework demonstrates strong generalization and structural scalability,\nproviding reliable support for intelligent modeling of chronic progressive\ndiseases such as Parkinson's

Nonetheless, using\nmachine learning to identify software vulnerabilities presents new challenges,\nespecially regarding the scale of data involved, which was not a factor in\ntraditional methods. Consequently, in spite of the rise of new\nmachine-learning-based approaches in that space, important shortcomings persist\nregarding their evaluation. First, researchers often fail to provide concrete\nstatistics about their training datasets, such as the number of samples for\neach type of vulnerability.

Our method employs mutation strategies that\ndynamically adapt based on performance feedback from previous iterations using\nQ-learning, enabling a more effective and accelerated traversal of the search\nspace. The proposed model is fully probabilistic, enabling effective\nexploration of the search space.

We observe that human navigation\nand movement in crowds are often influenced by complex social and environmental\ninteractions, driven mainly by language and dialogue. However, most existing\nwork does not consider these dimensions and leads to animations where\nagent-agent and agent-environment interactions are largely limited to steering\nand fixed higher-level goal extrapolation.\n  We propose a novel method that exploits large language models (LLMs) to\ncontrol agents' movement. Our method has two main components: a dialogue system\nand language-driven navigation. We periodically query agent-centric LLMs\nconditioned on character personalities, roles, desires, and relationships to\ncontrol the generation of inter-agent dialogue when necessitated by the spatial\nand social relationships with neighbouring agents. We then use the conversation\nand each agent's personality, emotional state, vision, and physical state to\ncontrol the navigation and steering of each agent. Our model thus enables\nagents to make motion decisions based on both their perceptual inputs and the\nongoing dialogue.\n  We validate our method in two complex scenarios that exemplify the interplay\nbetween social interactions, steering, and crowding. In these scenarios, we\nobserve that grouping and ungrouping of agents automatically occur.\nAdditionally, our experiments show that our method serves as an\ninformation-passing mechanism within the crowd.

To address these challenges,\nwe propose Linear Preference Optimization (LPO), a novel alignment framework\nfeaturing three key innovations. First, we introduce gradient decoupling by\nreplacing the log-sigmoid function with an absolute difference loss, thereby\nisolating the optimization dynamics.

Our key finding challenges the \"test-time scaling\" paradigm: while\nrecent reasoning LLMs achieve 48.7% accuracy in assessing expert confidence,\nincreasing reasoning budgets consistently impairs rather than improves\ncalibration. Extended reasoning leads to systematic overconfidence that worsens\nwith longer thinking budgets, producing diminishing and negative returns beyond\nmodest computational investments. Conversely, search-augmented generation\ndramatically outperforms pure reasoning, achieving 89.3% accuracy by retrieving\nrelevant evidence.

Both of these requirements are\nchallenging to meet in practice. In this paper, we introduce NetSight, a\nframework for supervised anomaly detection in network data that continually\ndetects and adapts to distribution shifts in an online manner.

However, existing\nmethods have critical limitations: they extract and transfer only user\nrepresentations (URs), ignoring valuable item representations (IRs) and\nuser-item cross representations (CRs); and they simply use a UR as a feature in\ndownstream applications, which fails to bridge upstream-downstream gaps and\noverlooks more transfer granularities. In this paper, we propose LFM4Ads, an\nAll-Representation Multi-Granularity transfer framework for ads recommendation.\nIt first comprehensively transfers URs, IRs, and CRs, i.e., all available\nrepresentations in the pre-trained foundation model. To effectively utilize the\nCRs, it identifies the optimal extraction layer and aggregates them into\ntransferable coarse-grained forms. Furthermore, we enhance the transferability\nvia multi-granularity mechanisms: non-linear adapters for feature-level\ntransfer, an Isomorphic Interaction Module for module-level transfer, and\nStandalone Retrieval for model-level transfer. LFM4Ads has been successfully\ndeployed in Tencent's industrial-scale advertising platform, processing tens of\nbillions of daily samples while maintaining terabyte-scale model parameters\nwith billions of sparse embedding keys across approximately two thousand\nfeatures. Since its production deployment in Q4 2024, LFM4Ads has achieved 10+\nsuccessful production launches across various advertising scenarios, including\nprimary ones like Weixin Moments and Channels. These launches achieve an\noverall GMV lift of 2.45% across the entire platform, translating to estimated\nannual revenue increases in the hundreds of millions of dollars.", "AI": {"tldr": "LFM4Ads\ub294 \uad11\uace0 \ucd94\ucc9c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ud45c\ud604\uacfc \ub2e4\uc911 \uc138\ubd84\ud654 \uc804\uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790, \uc544\uc774\ud15c, \ubc0f \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790-\uc544\uc774\ud15c \uad50\ucc28 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\uc774\ud558\uc5ec \uad11\uace0 \ucd94\ucc9c\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uad11\uace0\ub294 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ucd94\ucc9c \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uba70, \ucd5c\uadfc\uc5d0\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378(LFM)\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uad00\uc2ec\uc0ac\ub97c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc640 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "LFM4Ads\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ud45c\ud604(UR), \uc544\uc774\ud15c \ud45c\ud604(IR), \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790-\uc544\uc774\ud15c \uad50\ucc28 \ud45c\ud604(CR)\uc744 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\uc774\ud558\uace0, \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \ucd94\ucd9c \uacc4\uce35\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uba70, \ub2e4\uc911 \uc138\ubd84\ud654 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc804\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "LFM4Ads\ub294 Tencent\uc758 \uc0b0\uc5c5 \uaddc\ubaa8 \uad11\uace0 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubc30\ud3ec\ub418\uc5b4, \ub9e4\uc77c \uc218\uc2ed\uc5b5 \uac1c\uc758 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uba70, 2,000\uac1c\uc5d0 \uac00\uae4c\uc6b4 \uae30\ub2a5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud14c\ub77c\ubc14\uc774\ud2b8 \uaddc\ubaa8\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "LFM4Ads\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uad11\uace0 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c 10\ud68c \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc778 \uc0dd\uc0b0 \ucd9c\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ub3c4\ub2ec\ud588\uc73c\uba70, \uc804\uccb4 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc5d0\uc11c GMV\uac00 2.45% \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uc5ec \uc218\uc5b5 \ub2ec\ub7ec\uc758 \uc5f0\uac04 \uc218\uc775 \uc99d\uac00\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc84c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uad11\uace0\ub294 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ucd94\ucc9c \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uba70, \ucd5c\uadfc\uc5d0\ub294 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378(LFM)\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uad00\uc2ec\uc0ac\ub97c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc640 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ucea1\ucc98\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ubc1c\uc804\ud574\uc654\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uc8fc\uc694\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4: \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ud45c\ud604(UR)\ub9cc \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\uace0 \uc804\uc774\ud558\uc5ec \uc544\uc774\ud15c \ud45c\ud604(IR)\uacfc \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790-\uc544\uc774\ud15c \uad50\ucc28 \ud45c\ud604(CR)\uc744 \ubb34\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, UR\uc744 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud788 \ud558\ud5a5 \uc751\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud2b9\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc0c1\ud5a5-\ud558\ud5a5 \uac04 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uc18c\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uace0 \ub354 \uc138\ubd84\ud654\ub41c \uc804\uc774\ub97c \uac04\uacfc\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uad11\uace0 \ucd94\ucc9c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ud45c\ud604 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc138\ubd84\ud654 \uc804\uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 LFM4Ads\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

The\ncube-like method is first used by Dinur \\emph{et~al.} to analyze Keccak keyed\nmodes. At CT-RSA 2015, Dobraunig \\emph{et~al.} applied this method to 5/6-round\nreduced \\textsc{Ascon}, whose structure is similar to Keccak keyed modes.\nHowever, for \\textsc{Ascon} the non-linear layer is more complex and state is\nmuch smaller, which make it hard for the attackers to select enough cube\nvariables that do not multiply with each other after the first round. This\nseems to be the reason why the best previous key-recovery attack is on 6-round\n\\textsc{Ascon}, while for Keccak keyed modes (Keccak-MAC and Keyak) the\nattacked round is no less than 7-round.\n  In this paper, we generalize the conditional cube attack proposed by Huang\n\\emph{et~al.}, and find new cubes depending on some key bit conditions for\n5/6-round reduced \\textsc{Ascon}, and translate the previous theoretic 6-round\nattack with $2^{66}$ time complexity to a practical one with $2^{40}$ time\ncomplexity. Moreover, we propose the first 7-round key-recovery attack on\n\\textsc{Ascon}. By introducing \\emph{the cube-like key-subset technique}, we\ndivide the full key space into many subsets according to different key\nconditions. For each key subset, we launch the cube tester to determine if the\nkey falls into it. Finally, we recover the full key space by testing all the\nkey subsets. The total time complexity is about $2^{103.9}$. In addition, for a\nweak-key subset, whose size is $2^{117}$, the attack is more efficient and\ncosts only $2^{77}$ time complexity.

Quantum recurrent models like QLSTM are promising for\ntime-series prediction, NLP, and reinforcement learning. However, designing\neffective variational quantum circuits (VQCs) remains challenging and often\ntask-specific.

However,\npractitioners often operate under a \"utility-first\" paradigm, prioritizing a\ndesired level of utility and then determining the corresponding privacy cost.\n  Wu et al. [2019] initiated a formal study of this \"utility-first\" perspective\nby introducing ex-post DP. They demonstrated that by adding correlated Laplace\nnoise and progressively reducing it on demand, a sequence of increasingly\naccurate estimates of a private parameter can be generated, with the privacy\ncost attributed only to the least noisy iterate released. This led to a Laplace\nmechanism variant that achieves a specified utility with minimal privacy loss.\nHowever, their work, and similar findings by Whitehouse et al. [2022], are\nprimarily limited to simple mechanisms based on Laplace or Gaussian noise.\n  In this paper, we significantly generalize these results. In particular, we\nextend the work of Wu et al.

Traditional\ngap filling blurs fine-scale structures, whereas deep models lack confidence\nestimates. We present CuMoLoS-MAE, a Curriculum-Guided Monte Carlo Stochastic\nEnsemble Masked Autoencoder designed to (i) restore fine-scale features such as\nupdraft and downdraft cores, shear lines, and small vortices, (ii) learn a\ndata-driven prior over atmospheric fields, and (iii) quantify pixel-wise\nuncertainty. During training, CuMoLoS-MAE employs a mask-ratio curriculum that\nforces a ViT decoder to reconstruct from progressively sparser context. At\ninference, we approximate the posterior predictive by Monte Carlo over random\nmask realisations, evaluating the MAE multiple times and aggregating the\noutputs to obtain the posterior predictive mean reconstruction together with a\nfinely resolved per-pixel uncertainty map.

Due to security and privacy constraints in practice, attackers\ntypically possess limited knowledge of the victim system and thus need to craft\nprofiles that have transferability across black-box RSs. To maximize the attack\nimpact, the profiles often remains imperceptible. However, generating such\nhigh-quality profiles with the restricted resources is challenging. Some works\nsuggest incorporating fake textual reviews to strengthen the profiles; yet, the\npoor quality of the reviews largely undermines the attack effectiveness and\nimperceptibility under the practical setting.\n  To tackle the above challenges, in this paper, we propose to enhance the\nquality of the review text by harnessing in-context learning (ICL) capabilities\nof multimodal foundation models. To this end, we introduce a demonstration\nretrieval algorithm and a text style transfer strategy to augment the navie\nICL. Specifically, we propose a novel practical attack framework named RAGAN to\ngenerate high-quality fake user profiles, which can gain insights into the\nrobustness of RSs. The profiles are generated by a jailbreaker and\ncollaboratively optimized on an instructional agent and a guardian to improve\nthe attack transferability and imperceptibility.

The design integrated Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for\ngenerating dynamic image challenges, Reinforcement Learning (RL) for adaptive\ndifficulty tuning, and Large Language Models (LLMs) for creating text and audio\nprompts. Visual challenges included 3x3 grid selections with at least three\ncorrect images, while audio challenges combined randomized numbers and words\ninto a single task.

To formalize this setting,\nwe introduce Open-Universe Assistance Games (OU-AGs), a framework where the\nagent must reason over an unbounded and evolving space of possible goals. In\nthis context, we introduce GOOD (GOals from Open-ended Dialogue), a\ndata-efficient, online method that extracts goals in the form of natural\nlanguage during an interaction with a human, and infers a distribution over\nnatural language goals. GOOD prompts an LLM to simulate users with different\ncomplex intents, using its responses to perform probabilistic inference over\ncandidate goals. This approach enables rich goal representations and\nuncertainty estimation without requiring large offline datasets. We evaluate\nGOOD in a text-based grocery shopping domain and in a text-operated simulated\nhousehold robotics environment (AI2Thor), using synthetic user profiles.

This paper explores the\nevolving threat landscape associated with connected vehicles, focusing on risks\nsuch as unauthorized remote access and the potential leakage of personal data.\nTo assess the current state of protection, we conducted a comprehensive\nanalysis of 16 international standards and regulations, evaluating them from\nmultiple perspectives including regulatory strength, technical specificity,\ntreatment of supply chain risks, and approaches to personal data handling.\n  In parallel, we carried out a user-focused survey designed to map consumer\nattitudes toward smart cars. The survey investigated which types of vehicles\nusers trust and prefer, the reasons behind rejecting certain car types, their\nawareness of data-related risks, and whether they feel adequately informed\nabout how their vehicles handle data. By combining regulatory analysis with\nuser perception insights, this study aims to contribute to a more holistic\nunderstanding of the challenges and expectations surrounding connected vehicle\necosystems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc5f0\uacb0\ub41c \ucc28\ub7c9\uc758 \uc9c4\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc704\ud611 \uacbd\uad00\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ub41c \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548 \ubc0f \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud0d0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5f0\uacb0\ub41c \ucc28\ub7c9 \uae30\uc220\uc758 \uae09\uc18d\ud55c \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \ubaa8\ube4c\ub9ac\ud2f0\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc2dc\ub300\ub97c \uc5f4\uba74\uc11c \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548 \ubc0f \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc911\ub300\ud55c \uc6b0\ub824\ub97c \uc81c\uae30\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 16\uac1c\uc758 \uad6d\uc81c \ud45c\uc900\uacfc \uaddc\uc815\uc744 \uc885\ud569\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0, \uaddc\uc81c\uc758 \uac15\ub3c4, \uae30\uc220\uc801 \uc138\ubd80\uc0ac\ud56d, \uacf5\uae09\ub9dd \uc704\ud5d8 \ucc98\ub9ac, \uac1c\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ucc98\ub9ac \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd \ub4f1\uc744 \ub2e4\uac01\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \uc124\ubb38\uc870\uc0ac\ub97c \uc2e4\uc2dc\ud558\uc5ec \uc18c\ube44\uc790\ub4e4\uc758 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8\uce74\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud0dc\ub3c4\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc124\ubb38\uc870\uc0ac\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uac00 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud558\uace0 \uc120\ud638\ud558\ub294 \ucc28\ub7c9 \uc720\ud615, \ud2b9\uc815 \ucc28\ub7c9 \uc720\ud615\uc744 \uac70\ubd80\ud558\ub294 \uc774\uc720, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uad00\ub828 \uc704\ud5d8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc778\uc2dd, \ucc28\ub7c9\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ucc98\ub9ac \ubc29\uc2dd\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucda9\ubd84\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4 \uc81c\uacf5 \uc5ec\ubd80\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uaddc\uc81c \ubd84\uc11d\uacfc \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc778\uc2dd \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc5f0\uacb0\ub41c \ucc28\ub7c9 \uc0dd\ud0dc\uacc4\ub97c \ub458\ub7ec\uc2fc \ub3c4\uc804\uacfc \uae30\ub300\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub354 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \uc774\ud574\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc778\ud130\ub137\uc5d0 \uc5f0\uacb0\ub41c \ucc28\ub7c9 \uae30\uc220\uc758 \ube60\ub978 \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \ubaa8\ube4c\ub9ac\ud2f0\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc2dc\ub300\ub97c \uc5f4\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548 \ubc0f \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc81c\uae30\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc5f0\uacb0\ub41c \ucc28\ub7c9\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ub41c \uc9c4\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc704\ud611 \uacbd\uad00\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\uba70, \ubb34\ub2e8 \uc6d0\uaca9 \uc811\uadfc \ubc0f \uac1c\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc720\ucd9c \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc704\ud5d8\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd98\ub2e4. \ubcf4\ud638 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uaddc\uc81c\uc758 \uac15\ub3c4, \uae30\uc220\uc801 \uc138\ubd80\uc0ac\ud56d, \uacf5\uae09\ub9dd \uc704\ud5d8 \ucc98\ub9ac, \uac1c\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ucc98\ub9ac \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uc5ec 16\uac1c\uc758 \uad6d\uc81c \ud45c\uc900\uacfc \uaddc\uc815\uc744 \uc885\ud569\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc544\uc6b8\ub7ec, \uc18c\ube44\uc790\ub4e4\uc758 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8\uce74\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud0dc\ub3c4\ub97c \ub9e4\ud551\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \uc124\ubb38\uc870\uc0ac\ub97c \uc2e4\uc2dc\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc124\ubb38\uc870\uc0ac\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uac00 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud558\uace0 \uc120\ud638\ud558\ub294 \ucc28\ub7c9 \uc720\ud615, \ud2b9\uc815 \ucc28\ub7c9 \uc720\ud615\uc744 \uac70\ubd80\ud558\ub294 \uc774\uc720, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uad00\ub828 \uc704\ud5d8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc778\uc2dd, \ucc28\ub7c9\uc774 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucda9\ubd84\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4 \uc81c\uacf5 \uc5ec\ubd80\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uaddc\uc81c \ubd84\uc11d\uacfc \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc778\uc2dd \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368, \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc5f0\uacb0\ub41c \ucc28\ub7c9 \uc0dd\ud0dc\uacc4\ub97c \ub458\ub7ec\uc2fc \ub3c4\uc804\uacfc \uae30\ub300\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub354 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \uc774\ud574\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4."}}

This paper closes that\ngap for a specific class of {NOs}, generative {equilibrium operators} (GEOs),\nusing (realistic) finite-dimensional deep equilibrium layers, when solving\nfamilies of convex optimization problems over a separable Hilbert space $X$.\nHere, the inputs are smooth, convex loss functions on $X$, and outputs are the\nassociated (approximate) solutions to the optimization problem defined by each\ninput loss.\n  We show that when the input losses lie in suitable infinite-dimensional\ncompact sets, our GEO can uniformly approximate the corresponding solutions to\narbitrary precision, with rank, depth, and width growing only logarithmically\nin the reciprocal of the approximation error.

Yet this flood of AI-generated research content\ncollides with a fragmented and largely closed publication ecosystem.\nTraditional journals and conferences rely on human peer review, making them\ndifficult to scale and often reluctant to accept AI-generated research content;\nexisting preprint servers (e.g. arXiv) lack rigorous quality-control\nmechanisms. Consequently, a significant amount of high-quality AI-generated\nresearch lacks appropriate venues for dissemination, hindering its potential to\nadvance scientific progress. To address these challenges, we introduce aiXiv, a\nnext-generation open-access platform for human and AI scientists. Its\nmulti-agent architecture allows research proposals and papers to be submitted,\nreviewed, and iteratively refined by both human and AI scientists. It also\nprovides API and MCP interfaces that enable seamless integration of\nheterogeneous human and AI scientists, creating a scalable and extensible\necosystem for autonomous scientific discovery.

However, when interacting with untrusted data sources\n(e.g., fetching information from public websites), tool responses may contain\ninjected instructions that covertly influence agent behaviors and lead to\nmalicious outcomes, a threat referred to as Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI).\nExisting defenses typically rely on advanced prompting strategies or auxiliary\ndetection models. While these methods have demonstrated some effectiveness,\nthey fundamentally rely on assumptions about the model's inherent security,\nwhich lacks structural constraints on agent behaviors. As a result, agents\nstill retain unrestricted access to tool invocations, leaving them vulnerable\nto stronger attack vectors that can bypass the security guardrails of the\nmodel. To prevent malicious tool invocations at the source, we propose a novel\ndefensive task execution paradigm, called IPIGuard, which models the agents'\ntask execution process as a traversal over a planned Tool Dependency Graph\n(TDG). By explicitly decoupling action planning from interaction with external\ndata, IPIGuard significantly reduces unintended tool invocations triggered by\ninjected instructions, thereby enhancing robustness against IPI attacks.\nExperiments on the AgentDojo benchmark show that IPIGuard achieves a superior\nbalance between effectiveness and robustness, paving the way for the\ndevelopment of safer agentic systems in dynamic environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc774 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc18c\uc2a4\uc640 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud560 \ub54c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc720\ud574\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubc29\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc2e4\ud589 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc778 IPIGuard\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc18c\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc704\ud611\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "IPIGuard\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc2e4\ud589 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uacc4\ud68d\ub41c \ub3c4\uad6c \uc758\uc874\uc131 \uadf8\ub798\ud504(TDG) \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uc5ec, \uc678\ubd80 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uacfc \ud589\ub3d9 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ub9ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "IPIGuard\ub294 AgentDojo \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uacfc \uac15\uac74\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "IPIGuard\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uae38\uc744 \uc5f4\uc5b4\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc678\ubd80 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uac80\uc0c9\ud558\uace0 \uc870\uc791\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ud604\uc2e4 \uc138\uacc4\uc758 \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc5d0 \ub110\ub9ac \ubc30\ud3ec\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc18c\uc2a4(\uc608: \uacf5\uc6a9 \uc6f9\uc0ac\uc774\ud2b8\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc815\ubcf4 \uac80\uc0c9)\uc640 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud560 \ub54c \ub3c4\uad6c \uc751\ub2f5\uc5d0\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \uc740\ubc00\ud558\uac8c \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\uace0 \uc545\uc758\uc801\uc778 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc0bd\uc785\ub41c \uc9c0\uce68\uc774 \ud3ec\ud568\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc704\ud611\uc744 \uac04\uc811 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc8fc\uc785(IPI)\uc774\ub77c\uace0 \ud55c\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\uc5b4\ucc45\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uace0\uae09 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc804\ub7b5\uc774\ub098 \ubcf4\uc870 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ubcf8\ub798 \ubcf4\uc548\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac00\uc815\uc5d0 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc758\uc874\ud558\uba70, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc81c\uc57d\uc774 \uacb0\uc5ec\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\ub2e4. \uacb0\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ub3c4\uad6c \ud638\ucd9c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc81c\ud55c \uc5c6\ub294 \uc811\uadfc\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548 \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \uc6b0\ud68c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub354 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uacf5\uaca9 \ubca1\ud130\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\ub2e4. \uc545\uc758\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uad6c \ud638\ucd9c\uc744 \ubc29\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc2e4\ud589 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uacc4\ud68d\ub41c \ub3c4\uad6c \uc758\uc874\uc131 \uadf8\ub798\ud504(TDG) \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc2e4\ud589 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc778 IPIGuard\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc678\ubd80 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uacfc \ud589\ub3d9 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ub9ac\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 IPIGuard\ub294 \uc0bd\uc785\ub41c \uc9c0\uce68\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc758\ub3c4\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ub3c4\uad6c \ud638\ucd9c\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uc904\uc5ec IPI \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc778\ub2e4.

GUI-Owl-7B\nachieves 66.4 on AndroidWorld and 29.4 on OSWorld. Building on this, we propose\nMobile-Agent-v3, a general-purpose GUI agent framework that further improves\nperformance to 73.3 on AndroidWorld and 37.7 on OSWorld, setting a new\nstate-of-the-art for open-source GUI agent frameworks. GUI-Owl incorporates\nthree key innovations: (1) Large-scale Environment Infrastructure: a\ncloud-based virtual environment spanning Android, Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows,\nenabling our Self-Evolving GUI Trajectory Production framework. This generates\nhigh-quality interaction data via automated query generation and correctness\nvalidation, leveraging GUI-Owl to refine trajectories iteratively, forming a\nself-improving loop. It supports diverse data pipelines and reduces manual\nannotation. (2) Diverse Foundational Agent Capabilities: by integrating UI\ngrounding, planning, action semantics, and reasoning patterns, GUI-Owl supports\nend-to-end decision-making and can act as a modular component in multi-agent\nsystems. (3) Scalable Environment RL: we develop a scalable reinforcement\nlearning framework with fully asynchronous training for real-world alignment.\nWe also introduce Trajectory-aware Relative Policy Optimization (TRPO) for\nonline RL, achieving 34.9 on OSWorld.

While Control\nFlow Integrity (CFI) has gained traction to mitigate this exploitation path,\ndevelopers are not provided with any direction on how to apply CFI to\nreal-world software. In this work, we establish a taxonomy mapping LLVM's\nforward-edge CFI variants to memory corruption vulnerability classes, offering\nactionable guidance for developers seeking to deploy CFI incrementally in\nexisting codebases. Based on the Top 10 Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV)\nlist, we identify four high-impact vulnerability categories and select one\nrepresentative CVE for each. We evaluate LLVM's CFI against each CVE and\nexplain why CFI blocks exploitation in two cases while failing in the other\ntwo, illustrating its potential and current limitations.

Consequently,\nexisting auto-partitioners often suffer from out-of-memory errors or are\nprohibitively slow when exploring the exponentially large space of possible\npartitionings.

As concerns over data privacy and regulatory\ncompliance grow, machine unlearning, which aims to remove the influence of\nspecific data from trained models, has become increasingly important in the\nfederated setting to meet legal, ethical, or user-driven demands. However,\nintegrating unlearning into FL introduces new challenges and raises largely\nunexplored security risks. In particular, adversaries may exploit the\nunlearning process to compromise the integrity of the global model. In this\npaper, we present the first backdoor attack in the context of federated\nunlearning, demonstrating that an adversary can inject backdoors into the\nglobal model through seemingly legitimate unlearning requests. Specifically, we\npropose BadFU, an attack strategy where a malicious client uses both backdoor\nand camouflage samples to train the global model normally during the federated\ntraining process. Once the client requests unlearning of the camouflage\nsamples, the global model transitions into a backdoored state. Extensive\nexperiments under various FL frameworks and unlearning strategies validate the\neffectiveness of BadFU, revealing a critical vulnerability in current federated\nunlearning practices and underscoring the urgent need for more secure and\nrobust federated unlearning mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubc31\ub3c4\uc5b4 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744

However, their black-box nature reduces interpretability,\nwhich limits trust in their predictions for important applications such as drug\ndiscovery and materials design. Furthermore, existing explanation techniques\noften fail to reliably quantify the contribution of individual atoms or\nsubstructures due to the entangled message-passing dynamics. We introduce SEAL\n(Substructure Explanation via Attribution Learning), a new interpretable graph\nneural network that attributes model predictions to meaningful molecular\nsubgraphs. SEAL decomposes input graphs into chemically relevant fragments and\nestimates their causal influence on the output. The strong alignment between\nfragment contributions and model predictions is achieved by explicitly reducing\ninter-fragment message passing in our proposed model architecture. Extensive\nevaluations on synthetic benchmarks and real-world molecular datasets\ndemonstrate that SEAL outperforms other explainability methods in both\nquantitative attribution metrics and human-aligned interpretability. A user\nstudy further confirms that SEAL provides more intuitive and trustworthy\nexplanations to domain experts.

In the fine-tuning stage, an open-source\nfoundation model is fine-tuned on the dataset to provide diagnosis,\npersonalized treatment recommendations, and empathetic psychological support.\nIn the inference and expert evaluation stage, clinical and psychological\nspecialists assess accuracy, appropriateness, and empathy, with validated\nresponses iteratively enriching the dataset.

Current vetting processes are labor-intensive,\nrelying on manual analysis by security professionals aided by semi-automated\ntools. To address this inefficiency, we propose Mars, a system that leverages\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) for automated risk identification and profiling.\nMars is designed to concurrently analyze multiple applications across diverse\nrisk categories with minimal human intervention. To enhance analytical\nprecision and operational efficiency, Mars leverages a pre-constructed risk\nidentification tree to extract relevant indicators from high-dimensional\napplication features. This initial step filters the data, reducing the input\nvolume for the LLM and mitigating the potential for model hallucination induced\nby irrelevant features. The extracted indicators are then subjected to LLM\nanalysis for final risk determination. Furthermore, Mars automatically\ngenerates a comprehensive evidence chain for each assessment, documenting the\nanalytical process to provide transparent justification. These chains are\ndesigned to facilitate subsequent manual review and to inform enforcement\ndecisions, such as application delisting. The performance of Mars was evaluated\non a real-world dataset from a partner Android marketplace. The results\ndemonstrate that Mars attained an F1-score of 0.838 in risk identification and\nan F1-score of 0.934 in evidence retrieval.

This limitation is acute in overparameterized and low-data regimes,\nwhere models have many parameters relative to available data and can easily\noverfit. Bootstrapping is a classical statistical framework for uncertainty\nestimation based on resampling, but naively applying it to deep learning is\nimpractical: it requires training many replicas, produces post-hoc estimates\nthat cannot guide learning, and implicitly assumes comparable optima across\nruns - an assumption that fails in non-convex landscapes. We introduce\nTwin-Bootstrap Gradient Descent (Twin-Boot), a resampling-based training\nprocedure that integrates uncertainty estimation into optimization. Two\nidentical models are trained in parallel on independent bootstrap samples, and\na periodic mean-reset keeps both trajectories in the same basin so that their\ndivergence reflects local (within-basin) uncertainty.

As an illustrative example, we\ninstantiate the benchmark in a data center migration setting and evaluate\nmultiple LLMs using feasibility and error analysis, identifying degradation\nthresholds and constraint types most associated with failure. Empirically,\nstrong models are near-ceiling on precedence-only DAGs, but feasibility\nperformance collapses when downtime, temporal windows, and disjunctive\nconstraints interact, implicating constraint interaction, not graph depth, as\nthe principal bottleneck.

These papers claim to achieve new\nstate-of-the-art (SoTA) results and offer empirical results as validation.\nHowever, there is no consensus on which techniques are most effective or if\nthey genuinely meet their stated claims. Complicating matters, heterogeneity in\ncodebases, datasets, methodologies, and model architectures make direct\ncomparisons of different approaches challenging.\n  In this paper, we conduct a reproducibility and replicability (R+R)\nexperiment on 11 different SoTA DPML techniques from the recent research\nliterature. Results of our investigation are varied: while some methods stand\nup to scrutiny, others falter when tested outside their initial experimental\nconditions. We also discuss challenges unique to the reproducibility of DPML,\nincluding additional randomness due to DP noise, and how to address them.\nFinally, we derive insights and best practices to obtain scientifically valid\nand reliable results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uc5f0\uad6c \ubb38\ud5cc\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\uc548\ub41c 11\uac00\uc9c0 \ucc28\ub4f1 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5(DPML) \uae30\uc220\uc758 \uc7ac\ud604\uc131\uacfc \ubcf5\uc81c \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc2e4\ud5d8\ud558\uc5ec \uacb0\uacfc\uc640 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \ub17c\uc758\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ucd5c\uadfc \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ucc28\ub4f1 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc81c\uc548\ub418\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub4e4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uacfc \uc9c4\uc815\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud569\uc758\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ucd5c\uadfc \uc5f0\uad6c \ubb38\ud5cc\uc5d0\uc11c 11\uac00\uc9c0\uc758 SoTA DPML \uae30\uc220\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc7ac\ud604\uc131 \ubc0f \ubcf5\uc81c \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \uc2e4\ud5d8(R+R)\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc870\uc0ac \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud558\uc5ec \uc77c\ubd80 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \ucda9\uc871\ud558\ub294 \ubc18\uba74, \ub2e4\ub978 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ucd08\uae30 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uc870\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc97\uc5b4\ub098\uba74 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc800\ud558\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "DPML\uc758 \uc7ac\ud604\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uace0\uc720\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804\uc744 \ub17c\uc758\ud558\uace0 \uacfc\ud559\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\ud6a8\ud558\uace0 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc5bb\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc778\uc0ac\uc774\ud2b8\uc640 \ubaa8\ubc94 \uc0ac\ub840\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud588\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc\uc5d0 \ucc28\ub4f1 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5(DPML) \uae30\uc220\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\ub294 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc5f0\uad6c \ub17c\ubb38\uc774 \ubc1c\ud45c\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\ub4e4\uc740 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8(SoTA) \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\ub2e4\uace0 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud558\uba70 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uac80\uc99d\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc5b4\ub5a4 \uae30\uc220\uc774 \uac00\uc7a5 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778\uc9c0, \ud639\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c\ub85c \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud55c \ub0b4\uc6a9\uc744 \ucda9\uc871\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud569\uc758\uac00 \uc5c6\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucf54\ub4dc\ubca0\uc774\uc2a4, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8, \ubc29\ubc95\ub860 \ubc0f \ubaa8\ub378 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc758 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131\uc774 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc778 \ube44\uad50\ub97c \uc5b4\ub835\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4ed\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uc5f0\uad6c \ubb38\ud5cc\uc5d0\uc11c 11\uac1c\uc758 SoTA DPML \uae30\uc220\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc7ac\ud604\uc131 \ubc0f \ubcf5\uc81c \uac00\ub2a5\uc131(R+R) \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc870\uc0ac \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uc77c\ubd80 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc870\uc0ac\ub97c \ud1b5\uacfc\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub2e4\ub978 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ucd08\uae30 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uc870\uac74 \ubc16\uc5d0\uc11c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ud560 \ub54c \uc2e4\ud328\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c DP \ub178\uc774\uc988\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \ucd94\uac00 \ub09c\uc218\uc131\uacfc \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95 \ub4f1 DPML\uc758 \uc7ac\ud604\uc131\uc5d0 \uace0\uc720\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804\uc744 \ub17c\uc758\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c, \uacfc\ud559\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\ud6a8\ud558\uace0 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc5bb\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc778\uc0ac\uc774\ud2b8\uc640 \ubaa8\ubc94 \uc0ac\ub840\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

The layer-freezing technique\nhas recently attracted great attention as a promising method to effectively\nreduce the cost of network training. However, in traditional layer-freezing\nmethods, frozen layers are still required for forward propagation to generate\nfeature maps for unfrozen layers, limiting the reduction of computation costs.\nTo overcome this, prior works proposed a hypothetical solution, which caches\nfeature maps from frozen layers as a new dataset, allowing later layers to\ntrain directly on stored feature maps. While this approach appears to be\nstraightforward, it presents several major challenges that are severely\noverlooked by prior literature, such as how to effectively apply augmentations\nto feature maps and the substantial storage overhead introduced. If these\noverlooked challenges are not addressed, the performance of the caching method\nwill be severely impacted and even make it infeasible. This paper is the first\nto comprehensively explore these challenges and provides a systematic solution.\nTo improve training accuracy, we propose \\textit{similarity-aware channel\naugmentation}, which caches channels with high augmentation sensitivity with a\nminimum additional storage cost. To mitigate storage overhead, we incorporate\nlossy data compression into layer freezing and design a \\textit{progressive\ncompression} strategy, which increases compression rates as more layers are\nfrozen, effectively reducing storage costs. Finally, our solution achieves\nsignificant reductions in training cost while maintaining model accuracy, with\na minor time overhead. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of\nfreezing and compression strategies, providing insights into optimizing their\napplication for efficient DNN training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub525

This paper presents\nnovel computational intelligence approaches for optimizing land-use allocation\nin mixed-use areas, addressing inherent trade-offs between land-use\ncompatibility and economic objectives. We develop multiple optimization\nalgorithms, including custom variants integrating differential evolution with\nmulti-objective genetic algorithms. Key contributions include: (1) CR+DES\nalgorithm leveraging scaled difference vectors for enhanced exploration, (2)\nsystematic constraint relaxation strategy improving solution quality while\nmaintaining feasibility, and (3) statistical validation using Kruskal-Wallis\ntests with compact letter displays. Applied to a real-world case study with\n1,290 plots, CR+DES achieves 3.16\\% improvement in land-use compatibility\ncompared to state-of-the-art methods, while MSBX+MO excels in price\noptimization with 3.3\\% improvement. Statistical analysis confirms algorithms\nincorporating difference vectors significantly outperform traditional\napproaches across multiple metrics. The constraint relaxation technique enables\nbroader solution space exploration while maintaining practical constraints.\nThese findings provide urban planners and policymakers with evidence-based\ncomputational tools for balancing competing objectives in land-use allocation,\nsupporting more effective urban development policies in rapidly urbanizing\nregions.", "AI": {"tldr":

This setting arises naturally in distributed and\nfederated learning, crowdsourcing, and sensor networks, yet existing robust\nestimators typically assume uniform or worst-case corruption, ignoring\nstructural heterogeneity. For mean estimation for multivariate bounded\ndistributions and univariate gaussian distributions, we give tight minimax\nrates for all heterogeneous corruption patterns. For multivariate gaussian mean\nestimation and linear regression, we establish the minimax rate for squared\nerror up to a factor of $\\sqrt{d}$, where $d$ is the dimension. Roughly, our\nfindings suggest that samples beyond a certain corruption threshold may be\ndiscarded by the optimal estimators -- this threshold is determined by the\nempirical distribution of the corruption rates given.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc624\uc5fc \ube44\uc728 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\uac74\ud55c \ucd94\uc815 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uba70, \uac01 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc774 \ube44\uc2b7\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \ud655\ub960\ub85c \uc624\uc5fc\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubd84\uc0b0 \ud559\uc2b5, \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5, \ud06c\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc\uc18c\uc2f1, \uc13c\uc11c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ub4f1\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc624\uc5fc \ube44\uc728\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud55c \uac15\uac74\ud55c \ucd94\uc815 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub2e4\ubcc0\ub7c9 \uacbd\uacc4\ubd84\ud3ec \ubc0f \uc77c\ubcc0\ub7c9 \uac00\uc6b0\uc2dc\uc548 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud3c9\uade0 \ucd94\uc815\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801 \uc624\uc5fc \ud328\ud134\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ucd5c\uc18c \ucd5c\ub300 \ube44\uc728\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub2e4\ubcc0\ub7c9 \uac00\uc6b0\uc2dc\uc548 \ud3c9\uade0 \ucd94\uc815 \ubc0f \uc120\ud615 \ud68c\uadc0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc81c\uacf1 \uc624\ucc28\uc758 \ucd5c\uc18c \ucd5c\ub300 \ube44\uc728\uc744 $\text{\ucd5c\ub300}~\text{d}$\uc758 \uc694\uc18c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574\uc11c \uc218\ub9bd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ucd5c\uc801 \ucd94\uc815\uae30\ub294 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc624\uc5fc \uc784\uacc4\uac12\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\ub294 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \ud3d0\uae30\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774 \uc784\uacc4\uac12\uc740 \uc81c\uacf5\ub41c \uc624\uc5fc \ube44\uc728\uc758 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uacb0\uc815\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac01 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc774 \uc54c\ub824\uc838 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc \ube44\ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \ud655\ub960\ub85c \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc624\uc5fc\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801 \uc624\uc5fc \ube44\uc728 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\uac74\ud55c \ucd94\uc815 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc124\uc815\uc740 \ubd84\uc0b0 \ubc0f \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5, \ud06c\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc\uc18c\uc2f1, \uc13c\uc11c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7fd\uac8c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uac15\uac74 \ucd94\uc815\uae30\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uade0\uc77c\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ucd5c\uc545\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0 \uc624\uc5fc\uc744 \uac00\uc815\ud558\uace0 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131\uc744 \ubb34\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e4\ubcc0\ub7c9 \uacbd\uacc4 \ubd84\ud3ec \ubc0f \uc77c\ubcc0\ub7c9 \uac00\uc6b0\uc2dc\uc548 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud3c9\uade0 \ucd94\uc815\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801 \uc624\uc5fc \ud328\ud134\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \ucd5c\uc18c \ucd5c\ub300 \ube44\uc728\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e4\ubcc0\ub7c9 \uac00\uc6b0\uc2dc\uc548 \ud3c9\uade0 \ucd94\uc815 \ubc0f \uc120\ud615 \ud68c\uadc0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc81c\uacf1 \uc624\ucc28\uc758 \ucd5c\uc18c \ucd5c\ub300 \ube44\uc728\uc744 $\text{\ucd5c\ub300}~\text{d}$\uc758 \uc694\uc18c\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc124\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub300\ub7b5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc1c\uacac\uc740 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc624\uc5fc \uc784\uacc4\uac12\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\ub294 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc740 \ucd5c\uc801 \ucd94\uc815\uae30\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ud3d0\uae30\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774 \uc784\uacc4\uac12\uc740 \uc8fc\uc5b4\uc9c4 \uc624\uc5fc \ube44\uc728\uc758 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uacb0\uc815\ub41c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, their effectiveness is often highly sensitive to the choice of\nhyperparameters, especially the step-size. Tuning these parameters is often\ndifficult, resource-intensive, and time-consuming. Therefore, recent efforts\nhave been directed toward enhancing the stability of optimizers across a wide\nrange of hyperparameter choices [Schaipp et al., 2024]. In this paper, we\nintroduce an algorithm that matches the performance of state-of-the-art\noptimizers while improving stability to the choice of the step-size\nhyperparameter through a novel adaptation of the NGN step-size method [Orvieto\nand Xiao, 2024]. Specifically, we propose a momentum-based version (NGN-M) that\nattains the standard convergence rate of $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{K})$ under less\nrestrictive assumptions, without the need for interpolation condition or\nassumptions of bounded stochastic gradients or iterates, in contrast to\nprevious approaches.

To\nexplore this phenomenon, we introduce an analytical framework based on maximum\nlikelihood estimation, without adhering to conventional numerical approaches\nthat rely on gradient-based optimization and explicit labels. Our analysis\nreveals that DNNs operating in an overparameterized regime exhibit a collapse\nin the output feature space. While this collapse improves network\ngeneralization, adding more layers eventually leads to a state of degeneracy,\nwhere the model learns trivial solutions by mapping distinct inputs to the same\noutput, resulting in zero loss. Further investigation demonstrates that this\ndegeneracy can be bypassed using our newly derived \"wormhole\" solution. The\nwormhole solution, when applied to arbitrary fooling examples, reconciles\nmeaningful labels with random ones and provides a novel perspective on shortcut\nlearning.

Human feedback is an appealing alternative, but its\ntwo common forms, expert demonstrations and preferences, have complementary\nlimitations. Demonstrations provide stepwise supervision, but they are costly\nto collect and often reflect limited expert behavior modes. In contrast,\npreferences are easier to collect, but it is unclear which parts of a behavior\ncontribute most to a trajectory segment, leaving credit assignment unresolved.\nIn this paper, we introduce a Search-Based Preference Weighting (SPW) scheme to\nunify these two feedback sources. For each transition in a preference labeled\ntrajectory, SPW searches for the most similar state-action pairs from expert\ndemonstrations and directly derives stepwise importance weights based on their\nsimilarity scores. These weights are then used to guide standard preference\nlearning, enabling more accurate credit assignment that traditional approaches\nstruggle to achieve. We demonstrate that SPW enables effective joint learning\nfrom preferences and demonstrations, outperforming prior methods that leverage\nboth feedback types on challenging robot manipulation tasks.",

Sparse autoencoders (SAEs)\nhave been proposed to mitigate this issue by transforming dense activations\ninto sparse, more interpretable features. While prior work suggests that SAEs\npromote monosemanticity, there has been no quantitative comparison with their\nbase models. This paper provides the first systematic evaluation of SAEs\nagainst base models concerning monosemanticity. We introduce a fine-grained\nconcept separability score based on the Jensen-Shannon distance, which captures\nhow distinctly a neuron's activation distributions vary across concepts. Using\nGemma-2-2B and multiple SAE variants across five benchmarks, we show that SAEs\nreduce polysemanticity and achieve higher concept separability. However,\ngreater sparsity of SAEs does not always yield better separability and often\nimpairs downstream performance. To assess practical utility, we evaluate\nconcept-level interventions using two strategies: full neuron masking and\npartial suppression. We find that, compared to base models, SAEs enable more\nprecise concept-level control when using partial suppression. Building on this,\nwe propose Attenuation via Posterior Probabilities (APP), a new intervention\nmethod that uses concept-conditioned activation distributions for targeted\nsuppression. APP outperforms existing approaches in targeted concept removal.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud76c\uc18c \uc790\ub3d9 \ubd80\ud638\uae30(SAE)\uac00 \ub2e4\uc758\uc131\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uace0 \uac1c\ub150 \ubd84\ub9ac \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uba70, \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uac1c\ub150 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uac1c\uc785 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud574\uc11d\ud558\ub294 \ub370\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4\uc11c\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc7a5\ubcbd \uc911 \ud558\ub098\ub294 \ub2e4\uc758\uc131\uc73c\ub85c, \uc774\ub294 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc774 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uac1c\ub150\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud65c\uc131\ud654\ub418\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 Jensen-Shannon \uac70\ub9ac\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uc138\ubd84\ud654\ub41c \uac1c\ub150 \ubd84\ub9ac \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec SAEs\uc640 \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ubaa8\ub178\uc138\ub9e8\uc2dc\ud2f0\ub97c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "SAEs\ub294 \ub2e4\uc758\uc131\uc744 \ub0ae\ucd94\uace0 \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \uac1c\ub150 \ubd84\ub9ac \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\uc9c0\ub9cc, SAEs\uc758 \ub354 \ud070 \ud76c\uc18c\uc131\uc774 \ud56d\uc0c1 \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \ubd84\ub9ac \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uac00\uc838\uc624\uc9c0\ub294 \uc54a\uc73c\uba70, \uc885\uc885 \ud558\uc704 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc800\ud558\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "SAEs\ub294 \ubd80\ubd84 \uc5b5\uc81c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \ub54c \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ub354 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uac1c\ub150 \uc218\uc900 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uba70, \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uac1c\uc785 \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 APP\uac00 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc720\ud6a8\ud55c \uac1c\ub150 \uc81c\uac70 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud574\uc11d\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\uc5b4\uc11c \uc8fc\uc694 \uc7a5\ubcbd \uc911 \ud558\ub098\ub294 \ub2e4\uc758\uc131\uc73c\ub85c, \uc774\ub294 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc758 \ub274\ub860\uc774 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uac1c\ub150\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud65c\uc131\ud654\ub418\ub294 \ud604\uc0c1\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud76c\uc18c \uc790\ub3d9 \ubd80\ud638\uae30(SAE)\uac00 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc644\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubc00\ub3c4 \uc788\ub294 \ud65c\uc131\ud654\ub97c \ud76c\uc18c\ud558\uace0 \ub354 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc81c\uc548\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uc804\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 SAE\uac00 \ubaa8\ub178\uc138\ub9e8\uc2dc\ud2f0\ub97c \ucd09\uc9c4\ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \uc81c\uc548\ud588\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc\uc758 \uc815\ub7c9\uc801 \ube44\uad50\ub294 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc9c0\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubaa8\ub178\uc138\ub9e8\uc2dc\ud2f0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c SAE\uc640 \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Jensen-Shannon \uac70\ub9ac\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uc138\ubd84\ud654\ub41c \uac1c\ub150 \ubd84\ub9ac \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \ub274\ub860\uc758 \ud65c\uc131\ud654 \ubd84\ud3ec\uac00 \uac1c\ub150\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc5bc\ub9c8\ub098 \ub3c5\ud2b9\ud558\uac8c \ubcc0\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ucea1\ucc98\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

First,\nthey assume users provide explicit queries, while in reality requirements are\noften implicit. Second, existing solutions ignore diverse environmental factors\nand user preferences, limiting the feasibility of plans. Third, systems can\nonly generate plans with basic POI arrangements, failing to provide all-in-one\nplans with rich details. To mitigate these challenges, we construct a novel\ndataset \\textbf{RETAIL}, which supports decision-making for implicit queries\nwhile covering explicit queries, both with and without revision needs. It also\nenables environmental awareness to ensure plan feasibility under real-world\nscenarios, while incorporating detailed POI information for all-in-one travel\nplans. Furthermore, we propose a topic-guided multi-agent framework, termed\nTGMA. Our experiments reveal that even the strongest existing model achieves\nmerely a 1.0% pass rate, indicating real-world travel planning remains\nextremely challenging. In contrast, TGMA demonstrates substantially improved\nperformance 2.72%, offering promising directions for real-world travel\nplanning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc790\ub3d9 \uc5ec\ud589 \uacc4\ud68d \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \ud604\uc7ac \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc640 \ub9de\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub2e4. \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ucffc\ub9ac\uac00 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc774\ub77c\uace0 \uac00\uc815\ud558\uba70, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud658\uacbd \uc694\uc18c\uc640 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc120\ud638\ub97c \ubb34\uc2dc\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc5b4 \uacc4\ud68d\uc758 \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc5ec\uae30\uc11c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b RETAIL\uc744 \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uc8fc\uc81c \uc548\ub0b4 \uba40\ud2f0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c TGMA\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, TGMA\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6d4\ub4f1\ud558\uac8c \uac1c\uc120\ub41c \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc790\ub3d9 \uc5ec\ud589 \uacc4\ud68d \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf30\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc2e4\uc81c \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uacfc \ub9de\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc544 \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud588\ub2e4.", "method": "RETAIL\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uace0 TGMA\ub77c\ub294 \uc8fc\uc81c \uc548\ub0b4 \uba40\ud2f0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uae30\uc874 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 1.0%\uc758 \ud1b5\uacfc\uc728\uc5d0 \ubd88\uacfc\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc TGMA\ub294 2.72%\uc758 \uc131\uacfc \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "TGMA\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc5ec\ud589 \uacc4\ud68d\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc790\ub3d9 \uc5ec\ud589 \uacc4\ud68d \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf30\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud604\uc7ac \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc640 \ub9de\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub2e4. \uccab\uc9f8, \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\ub4e4\uc774 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc778 \ucffc\ub9ac\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \uac00\uc815\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc2e4\uc81c\ub85c \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uc554\ubb35\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \ub458\uc9f8, \uae30\uc874 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud658\uacbd \uc694\uc18c\uc640 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc120\ud638\ub97c \ubb34\uc2dc\ud558\uc5ec \uacc4\ud68d\uc758 \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc14b\uc9f8, \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 POI \ubc30\uc5f4\ub85c\ub9cc \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc5b4 \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \uc138\ubd80 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \uc62c\uc778\uc6d0 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc644\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801 \ucffc\ub9ac\uc640 \uc218\uc815 \ud544\uc694 \uc5ec\ubd80\ub97c \ubaa8\ub450 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc554\ubb35\uc801 \ucffc\ub9ac\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b RETAIL\uc744 \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc2e4\uc81c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uacc4\ud68d\uc758 \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud658\uacbd \uc778\uc2dd\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uba70, \uc62c\uc778\uc6d0 \uc5ec\ud589 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc138\ubd80 POI \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uac8c\ub2e4\uac00, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 TGMA\ub77c\ub294 \uc8fc\uc81c \uc548\ub0b4 \uba40\ud2f0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uac00\uc7a5 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uae30\uc874 \ubaa8\ub378\uc870\ucc28 1.0%\uc758 \ud1b5\uacfc\uc728\uc5d0 \uadf8\uce58\uba70, \uc2e4\uc81c \uc5ec\ud589 \uacc4\ud68d\uc774 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc784\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b8\ub2e4. \ubc18\uba74 TGMA\ub294 2.72%\ub85c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \uac1c\uc120\ub41c \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec \uc2e4\uc81c \uc5ec\ud589 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

We present DiagECG, a\nnovel framework that integrates time-series and language modeling by enabling\nlarge language models to process 12-lead ECG signals for clinical text\ngeneration tasks. Our approach discretizes continuous ECG embeddings into\nsymbolic tokens using a lead-independent encoder and quantization module. These\ntokens are then used to extend the vocabulary of LLM, allowing the model to\nhandle both ECG and natural language inputs in a unified manner. To bridge the\nmodality gap, we pretrain the model on an autoregressive ECG forecasting task,\nenabling the LLM to model temporal dynamics using its native language modeling\ncapabilities. Finally, we perform instruction tuning on both ECG question\nanswering and diagnostic report generation. Without modifying the core model,\nDiagECG achieves strong performance across tasks while maintaining\ngeneralization to out-of-distribution settings.

Existing unlearning\nmethods often rely on the assumption of having access to the entire training\ndataset during the forgetting process. However, this assumption may not hold\ntrue in practical scenarios where the original training data may not be\naccessible, i.e., the source-free setting. To address this challenge, we focus\non the source-free unlearning scenario, where an unlearning algorithm must be\ncapable of removing specific data from a trained model without requiring access\nto the original training dataset. Building on recent work, we present a method\nthat can estimate the Hessian of the unknown remaining training data, a crucial\ncomponent required for efficient unlearning. Leveraging this estimation\ntechnique, our method enables efficient zero-shot unlearning while providing\nrobust theoretical guarantees on the unlearning performance, while maintaining\nperformance on the remaining data. Extensive experiments over a wide range of\ndatasets verify the efficacy of our method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5\uacfc \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \uaddc\uc81c\uac00 \ubc1c\uc804\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4\ub098 \uc800\uc791\uad8c \uc815\ubcf4 \uc81c\uac70 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uc911\uc694\ud574\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ucd9c\ucc98 \uc5c6\ub294 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \ud2b9\uc815 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc81c\uac70\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub370\uc774\ud130 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \uaddc\uc81c\uac00 \ubc1c\uc804\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4\ub098 \uc800\uc791\uad8c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc81c\uac70\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uc911\uc694\ud574\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6d0\ub798 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \uc811\uadfc\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0\ub3c4 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \ud2b9\uc815 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc81c\uac70\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \uc794\uc5ec \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ud5e4\uc2dc\uc548\uc744 \ucd94\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 unlearning\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 zero-shot unlearning\uc744 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uac80\uc99d\ub41c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \ub098\uba38\uc9c0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 unlearning \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc774 \ub354\uc6b1 \ubcf4\ud3b8\ud654\ub418\uace0 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \uaddc\uc81c\uac00 \ubc1c\uc804\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ub610\ub294 \uc800\uc791\uad8c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc81c\uac70\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc774 \ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 unlearning \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uc78a\ub294 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc804\uccb4 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \uc811\uadfc\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uac00\uc815\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud55c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774 \uac00\uc815\uc740 \uc6d0\ubcf8 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \uc811\uadfc\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc0c1\ud669\uc778 \uc18c\uc2a4\uac00 \uc5c6\ub294 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc131\ub9bd\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc18c\uc2a4\uac00 \uc5c6\ub294 unlearning \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc5ec\uae30\uc11c unlearning \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \uc6d0\ubcf8 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \uc811\uadfc\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0\ub3c4 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \ud2b9\uc815 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc81c\uac70\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc5b4\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ucd5c\uadfc \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uae30\ucd08\ud558\uc5ec, \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 unlearning\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\uc778 \uc54c\ub824\uc9c0\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uc794\uc5ec \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ud5e4\uc2dc\uc548\uc744 \ucd94\uc815\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ucd94\uc815 \uae30\uc220\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \ubcf8 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc794\uc5ec \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c unlearning \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacac\uace0\ud55c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 zero-shot unlearning\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubcf8 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4."}}

Our approach employs a modular and\nconfiguration-based pipeline capable of modeling complex dialogue flows with\nminimal manual intervention.

In the first half of the paper, we review the\nbasic RL framework, illustrate the use of categories and functors in RL,\nshowing how they lead to interesting insights.

Dynamical system models, such as Markov\ndecision processes (MDPs), partially observed MDPs (POMDPs), a predictive state\nrepresentation (PSRs), and linear dynamical systems (LDSs) are all special\ntypes of coalgebras.

This paper introduces BusiAgent, a novel multi-agent\nframework leveraging LLMs for advanced decision-making in complex corporate\nenvironments. BusiAgent integrates three core innovations: an extended\nContinuous Time Markov Decision Process (CTMDP) for dynamic agent modeling, a\ngeneralized entropy measure to optimize collaborative efficiency, and a\nmulti-level Stackelberg game to handle hierarchical decision processes.\nAdditionally, contextual Thompson sampling is employed for prompt optimization,\nsupported by a comprehensive quality assurance system to mitigate errors.\nExtensive empirical evaluations across diverse business scenarios validate\nBusiAgent's efficacy, demonstrating its capacity to generate coherent,\nclient-focused solutions that smoothly integrate granular insights with\nhigh-level strategy, significantly outperforming established approaches in both\nsolution quality and user satisfaction. By fusing cutting-edge AI technologies\nwith deep business insights, BusiAgent marks a substantial step forward in\nAI-driven enterprise decision-making, empowering organizations to navigate\ncomplex business landscapes more effectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "BusiAgent\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uae30\uc5c5 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 LLM\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc5c5 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uc9c0\uc6d0 \ubc0f \uc804\ub7b5 \uae30\ud68d\uc5d0\uc11c LLM\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "\ub3d9\uc801 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5\ub41c CTMDP, \ud611\uc5c5 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub41c \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \uce21\uc815, \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc2a4\ud0c0\ucf08\ubc84\uadf8 \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uace0, \uc2e0\uc18d\ud55c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ub9e5\ub77d\uc801 \ud0d0\uc2a8 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "BusiAgent\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ube44\uc988\ub2c8\uc2a4 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uadf8 \ud6a8\ub2a5\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uba70, \uace0\uac1d \uc911\uc2ec \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uac1c\uc120\ub41c \ud488\uc9c8\uacfc \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ub9cc\uc871\ub3c4\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "BusiAgent\ub294 AI \uae30\ubc18 \uae30\uc5c5 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ud55c \ub2e8\uacc4 \ub04c\uc5b4\uc62c\ub9ac\uba70, \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ube44\uc988\ub2c8\uc2a4 \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc740 \ube44\uc988\ub2c8\uc2a4 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8, \ud2b9\ud788 \uae30\uc5c5 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \uc9c0\uc6d0 \ubc0f \uc804\ub7b5 \uae30\ud68d\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc6b4\uc601 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc2dc\uc7a5 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \uc804\ub7b5 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc640 \uc870\ud654\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud750\ub984\uc774 \ub2e8\ud3b8\ud654\ub418\uace0 \uc870\uc9c1\uc758 \ud611\uc5c5\uc774 \uc800\ud558\ub418\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uae30\uc5c5 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uace0\uae09 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc704\ud574 LLM\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 BusiAgent\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.

In this\npaper, we propose SafeLLM, a novel unlearning-based defense framework that\nunlearn the harmful knowledge from LLMs while preserving linguistic fluency and\ngeneral capabilities. SafeLLM employs a three-stage pipeline: (1) dynamic\nunsafe output detection using a hybrid approach that integrates external\nclassifiers with model-internal evaluations; (2) token-level harmful content\ntracing through feedforward network (FFN) activations to localize harmful\nknowledge; and (3) constrained optimization to suppress unsafe behavior without\ndegrading overall model quality. SafeLLM achieves targeted and irreversible\nforgetting by identifying and neutralizing FFN substructures responsible for\nharmful generation pathways. Extensive experiments on prominent LLMs (Vicuna,\nLLaMA, and GPT-J) across multiple jailbreak benchmarks show that SafeLLM\nsubstantially reduces attack success rates while maintaining high\ngeneral-purpose performance. Compared to standard defense methods such as\nsupervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization, SafeLLM offers\nstronger safety guarantees, more precise control over harmful behavior, and\ngreater robustness to unseen attacks.

Recent work has addressed the 3D situated\nreasoning task by invoking tool usage through large language models. Large\nlanguage models call tools via APIs and integrate the generated programs\nthrough a chain of thought to solve problems based on the program results.\nHowever, due to the simplicity of the questions in the dataset, the generated\nprogram reasoning chains are relatively short. To solve this main challenge, in\nthis paper, we introduce DeepThink3D to enhance the tool usage of LLMs in\ncomplex 3D situated reasoning tasks. Our work proposes a combinatorial and\niterative evolutionary approach on the SQA3D benchmark to generate more complex\nquestions. Building on this foundation, we fine-tune the large language model\nto make it more proficient in using 3D tools. By employing Direct Preference\nOptimization (DPO), we directly optimize the toolchain strategies generated by\nmodels, thereby enhancing their accuracy in complex tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 3D \uc7a5\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ucd5c\uadfc \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \ud638\ucd9c\ud558\uc5ec 3D \uc704\uce58 \uae30\ubc18 \ucd94\ub860 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8e8\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "DeepThink3D\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec SQA3D \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub354 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc870\ud569\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \uc9c4\ud654 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c 3D \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \ub354 \ub2a5\uc219\ud558\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4dc\ub294 \ub370 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ud558\uace0, Direct Preference Optimization(DPO)\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub3c4\uad6c \uccb4\uc778 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc9c1\uc811 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc774 3D \uc7a5\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \ud638\ucd9c\ud558\uc5ec 3D \uc704\uce58 \uae30\ubc18 \ucd94\ub860 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8e8\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 API\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \ud638\ucd9c\ud558\uace0 \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc744 \uc0ac\uace0\uc758 \uc5f0\uc1c4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc758 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc774 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud558\uc5ec \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8 \ucd94\ub860 \uccb4\uc778\uc774 \uc0c1\ub300\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc9e7\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc8fc\uc694 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 DeepThink3D\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c 3D \uc704\uce58 \uae30\ubc18 \ucd94\ub860 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c LLM\uc758 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0\uc790 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 SQA3D \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub354 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc870\ud569\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \uc9c4\ud654 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uae30\ubc18 \uc704\uc5d0, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ud558\uc5ec 3D \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc5d0 \ub354 \ub2a5\uc219\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ub9cc\ub4ed\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Methods to mitigate bias typically fall into three\ncategories: pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing. While\nsignificant attention has been devoted to the latter two, pre-processing\nmethods, which operate at the data level and offer advantages such as\nmodel-agnosticism and improved privacy compliance, have received comparatively\nless focus and lack standardised evaluation tools. In this work, we introduce\nFairPrep, an extensible and modular benchmarking framework designed to evaluate\nfairness-aware pre-processing techniques on tabular datasets.

However, similar to conventional neural networks,\nTNNs are also influenced by the Frequency Principle, which limits their ability\nto accurately capture high-frequency features of the solution. In this work, we\nanalyze the training dynamics of TNNs by Fourier analysis and enhance their\nexpressivity for high-dimensional multi-scale problems by incorporating random\nFourier features. Leveraging the inherent tensor structure of TNNs, we further\npropose a novel approach to extract frequency features of high-dimensional\nfunctions by performing the Discrete Fourier Transform to one-dimensional\ncomponent functions.

However, manual inspection of EEG\ncharacteristics for each stage is time-consuming and prone to human error.\nAlthough machine learning and deep learning methods have been actively\ndeveloped, they continue to face challenges from the non-stationarity and\nvariability of electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG)\nsignals, often leading to poor generalization on unseen datasets. This research\nproposed a Sleep Stage Classification method by developing Multivariate\nDifferential Transformer (SleepDIFFormer) for joint EEG and EOG representation\nlearning. Specifically, SleepDIFFormer was developed to process EEG and EOG\nsignals using our Multivariate Differential Transformer Architecture (MDTA) for\ntime series, trained with cross-domain alignment. Our method mitigated spatial\nand temporal attention noise while learning a domain-invariant joint EEG-EOG\nrepresentation through feature distribution alignment, thereby enabling\ngeneralization to unseen target datasets. Empirically, we evaluated our method\non five different sleep staging datasets and compared it with existing\napproaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance. We also conducted thorough\nablation analyses of SleepDIFFormer and interpreted the differential attention\nweights, highlighting their relevance to characteristic sleep EEG patterns.\nThese findings have implications for advancing automated sleep stage\nclassification and its application to sleep quality assessment.

Submitted and accepted to the 23rd International\n  Conference on Cognitive Modeling (ICCM 2025)", "summary": "Holographic Declarative Memory (HDM) is a vector-symbolic alternative to\nACT-R's Declarative Memory (DM) system that can bring advantages such as\nscalability and architecturally defined similarity between DM chunks. We\nadapted HDM to work with the most comprehensive and widely-used implementation\nof ACT-R (Lisp ACT-R) so extant ACT-R models designed with DM can be run with\nHDM without major changes. With this adaptation of HDM, we have developed\nvector-based versions of common ACT-R functions, set up a text processing\npipeline to add the contents of large documents to ACT-R memory, and most\nsignificantly created a useful and novel mechanism to retrieve an entire chunk\nof memory based on a request using only vector representations of tokens.\nPreliminary results indicate that we can maintain vector-symbolic advantages of\nHDM (e.g., chunk recall without storing the actual chunk and other advantages\nwith scaling) while also extending it so that previous ACT-R models may work\nwith the system with little (or potentially no) modifications within the actual\nprocedural and declarative memory portions of a model. As a part of iterative\nimprovement of this newly translated holographic declarative memory module, we\nwill continue to explore better time-context representations for vectors to\nimprove the module's ability to reconstruct chunks during recall.

While many industrial platforms support diverse attribution\nmechanisms (e.g., First-Click, Last-Click, Linear, and Data-Driven Multi-Touch\nAttribution), conventional approaches restrict model training to labels from a\nsingle production-critical attribution mechanism, discarding complementary\nsignals in alternative attribution perspectives.\n  To address this limitation, we propose a novel Multi-Attribution Learning\n(MAL) framework for CVR prediction that integrates signals from multiple\nattribution perspectives to better capture the underlying patterns driving user\nconversions. Specifically, MAL is a joint learning framework consisting of two\ncore components: the Attribution Knowledge Aggregator (AKA) and the Primary\nTarget Predictor (PTP). AKA is implemented as a multi-task learner that\nintegrates knowledge extracted from diverse attribution labels. PTP, in\ncontrast, focuses on the task of generating well-calibrated conversion\nprobabilities that align with the system-optimized attribution metric (e.g.,\nCVR under the Last-Click attribution), ensuring direct compatibility with\nindustrial deployment requirements. Additionally, we propose CAT, a novel\ntraining strategy that leverages the Cartesian product of all attribution label\ncombinations to generate enriched supervision signals.

Exploring the trade-off between these objectives is essential\nfor developing trustworthy interpretations. While many techniques for\nmulti-objective interpretation synthesis have been developed, they typically\nlack formal guarantees on the Pareto-optimality of the results. Methods that do\nprovide such guarantees, on the other hand, often face severe scalability\nlimitations when exploring the Pareto-optimal space. To address this, we\ndevelop a framework based on local optimality guarantees that enables more\nscalable synthesis of interpretations. Specifically, we consider the problem of\nsynthesizing a set of Pareto-optimal interpretations with local optimality\nguarantees, within the immediate neighborhood of each solution. Our approach\nbegins with a multi-objective learning or search technique, such as\nMulti-Objective Monte Carlo Tree Search, to generate a best-effort set of\nPareto-optimal candidates with respect to accuracy and explainability. We then\nverify local optimality for each candidate as a Boolean satisfiability problem,\nwhich we solve using a SAT solver. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach\non a set of benchmarks, comparing it against previous methods for exploring the\nPareto-optimal front of interpretations. In particular, we show that our\napproach yields interpretations that closely match those synthesized by methods\noffering global guarantees.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740

Using\ncross-disciplinary methods, we develop a technically grounded and\nphilosophically coherent analysis of regulatory blind spots. Our central claim\nis that what remains absent from policymaking is an account of the dynamic of\nbecoming that underpins both the technical operation and economic logic of AI.\nTo address this, we advance a formal reading of AI inspired by Simondonian\nphilosophy of technology, reworking his concept of individuation to model the\nAI lifecycle, including the pre-individual milieu, individuation, and\nindividuated AI. To translate these ideas, we introduce futurity: the\nself-reinforcing lifecycle of AI, where more data enhances performance, deepens\npersonalisation, and expands application domains. Futurity highlights the\nrecursively generative, non-rivalrous nature of data, underpinned by\ninfrastructures like feature stores that enable feedback, adaptation, and\ntemporal recursion. Our intervention foregrounds escalating power asymmetries,\nparticularly the tech oligarchy whose infrastructures of capture, training, and\ndeployment concentrate value and decision-making. We argue that effective\nregulation must address these infrastructural and temporal dynamics, and\npropose measures including lifecycle audits, temporal traceability, feedback\naccountability, recursion transparency, and a right to contest recursive reuse.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 EU AI \ubc95\uc548\uc758 \uae30\uc220 \ucca0\ud559\uc801 \ud574\uc11d\uc774 AI

The final\n  published version will be available via IEEE Xplore", "summary": "Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is foundational for cardiovascular disease\ndiagnosis, yet the performance of deep learning models is often constrained by\nlimited access to annotated data. Self-supervised contrastive learning has\nemerged as a powerful approach for learning robust ECG representations from\nunlabeled signals. However, most existing methods generate only pairwise\naugmented views and fail to leverage the rich temporal structure of ECG\nrecordings. In this work, we present a poly-window contrastive learning\nframework. We extract multiple temporal windows from each ECG instance to\nconstruct positive pairs and maximize their agreement via statistics. Inspired\nby the principle of slow feature analysis, our approach explicitly encourages\nthe model to learn temporally invariant and physiologically meaningful features\nthat persist across time. We validate our approach through extensive\nexperiments and ablation studies on the PTB-XL dataset. Our results demonstrate\nthat poly-window contrastive learning consistently outperforms conventional\ntwo-view methods in multi-label superclass classification, achieving higher\nAUROC (0.891 vs. 0.888) and F1 scores (0.680 vs. 0.679) while requiring up to\nfour times fewer pre-training epochs (32 vs. 128) and 14.8% in total wall clock\npre-training time reduction. Despite processing multiple windows per sample, we\nachieve a significant reduction in the number of training epochs and total\ncomputation time, making our method practical for training foundational models.\nThrough extensive ablations, we identify optimal design choices and demonstrate\nrobustness across various hyperparameters. These findings establish poly-window\ncontrastive learning as a highly efficient and scalable paradigm for automated\nECG analysis and provide a promising general framework for self-supervised\nrepresentation learning in biomedical time-series data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc708\ub3c4\uc6b0 \ub300\ube44 \ud559\uc2b5

It\nfeatures programmatically generated charts and synthetically rendered tables,\ncreated with Python visualization libraries to ensure control over data\nsemantics, structure, and clarity. Each GRAFT instance pairs a chart or table\nimage with a systematically generated, multi-step analytical question based\nsolely on visual content. Answers are provided in structured formats such as\nJSON or YAML, supporting consistent evaluation of both reasoning and output\nformat. The benchmark introduces a taxonomy of reasoning types including\ncomparison, trend identification, ranking, aggregation, proportion estimation,\nand anomaly detection to enable comprehensive assessment. Reference answers\nfollow strict factual and formatting guidelines for precise, aspect-based\nevaluation.

To address these challenges, we introduce Deep Think\nwith Confidence (DeepConf), a simple yet powerful method that enhances both\nreasoning efficiency and performance at test time.

While the Cumulative Spectral\nGradient (CSG) metric, derived from probabilistic divergence between classes\nwithin a spectral clustering framework, has been proposed as a classifier\nagnostic complexity metric purportedly scaling with class cardinality and\ncorrelating with downstream performance, it has not been evaluated in KG\nsettings so far. In this work, we critically examine CSG in the context of\nmulti relational link prediction, incorporating semantic representations via\ntransformer derived embeddings. Contrary to prior claims, we find that CSG is\nhighly sensitive to parametrisation and does not robustly scale with the number\nof classes. Moreover, it exhibits weak or inconsistent correlation with\nstandard performance metrics such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Hit@1. To\ndeepen the analysis, we introduce and benchmark a set of structural and\nsemantic KG complexity metrics. Our findings reveal that global and local\nrelational ambiguity captured via Relation Entropy, node level Maximum Relation\nDiversity, and Relation Type Cardinality exhibit strong inverse correlations\nwith MRR and Hit@1, suggesting these as more faithful indicators of task\ndifficulty. Conversely, graph connectivity measures such as Average Degree,\nDegree Entropy, PageRank, and Eigenvector Centrality correlate positively with\nHit@10.

However, no studies have measured AI serving\nenvironmental metrics in a production environment. This paper addresses this\ngap by proposing and executing a comprehensive methodology for measuring the\nenergy usage, carbon emissions, and water consumption of AI inference workloads\nin a large-scale, AI production environment. Our approach accounts for the full\nstack of AI serving infrastructure - including active AI accelerator power,\nhost system energy, idle machine capacity, and data center energy overhead.\nThrough detailed instrumentation of Google's AI infrastructure for serving the\nGemini AI assistant, we find the median Gemini Apps text prompt consumes 0.24\nWh of energy - a figure substantially lower than many public estimates. We also\nshow that Google's software efficiency efforts and clean energy procurement\nhave driven a 33x reduction in energy consumption and a 44x reduction in carbon\nfootprint for the median Gemini Apps text prompt over one year. We identify\nthat the median Gemini Apps text prompt uses less energy than watching nine\nseconds of television (0.24 Wh) and consumes the equivalent of five drops of\nwater (0.26 mL). While these impacts are low compared to other daily\nactivities, reducing the environmental impact of AI serving continues to\nwarrant important attention. Towards this objective, we propose that a\ncomprehensive measurement of AI serving environmental metrics is critical for\naccurately comparing models, and to properly incentivize efficiency

Recent approaches such as the L-Reg technique employ\nlogic-based regularization to enhance generalization but are bound by the\nnecessity of fully defined logical formulas, limiting flexibility for unknown\nclasses. This paper introduces PL-Reg, a novel partial-logic regularization\nterm that allows models to reserve space for undefined logic formulas,\nimproving adaptability to unknown classes. Specifically, we formally\ndemonstrate that tasks involving unknown classes can be effectively explained\nusing partial logic. We also prove that methods based on partial logic lead to\nimproved generalization. We validate PL-Reg through extensive experiments on\nGeneralized Category Discovery, Multi-Domain Generalized Category Discovery,\nand long-tailed Class Incremental Learning tasks, demonstrating consistent\nperformance improvements.

Yet preventing such dynamics\nis challenging: parasocial cues often emerge gradually in private\nconversations, and not all forms of emotional engagement are inherently\nharmful. We address this challenge by introducing a simple response evaluation\nframework, created by repurposing a state-of-the-art language model, that\nevaluates ongoing conversations for parasocial cues in real time. To test the\nfeasibility of this approach, we constructed a small synthetic dataset of\nthirty dialogues spanning parasocial, sycophantic, and neutral conversations.\nIterative evaluation with five stage testing successfully identified all\nparasocial conversations while avoiding false positives under a tolerant\nunanimity rule, with detection typically occurring within the first few\nexchanges.

However, the growing complexity of user interactions\ncalls for a more contextualized approach to ensure designs align with real user\nneeds. While earlier studies have advanced persona classification by modelling\nuser behaviour, capturing contextual information, especially by integrating\ntextual and tabular data, remains a key challenge. These models also often lack\nexplainability, leaving their predictions difficult to interpret or justify. To\naddress these limitations, we present ExBigBang (Explainable BigBang), a hybrid\ntext-tabular approach that uses transformer-based architectures to model rich\ncontextual features for persona classification. ExBigBang incorporates\nmetadata, domain knowledge, and user profiling to embed deeper context into\npredictions. Through a cyclical process of user profiling and classification,\nour approach dynamically updates to reflect evolving user behaviours.\nExperiments on a benchmark persona classification dataset demonstrate the\nrobustness of our model.

However,\nexisting methods face two critical yet under-explored issues: Structural Visit\nBias, where random walk sampling disproportionately emphasizes high-degree\nnodes, leading to redundant and noisy structural representations; and Abrupt\nEvolution Blindness, the failure to effectively detect sudden structural\nchanges due to rigid or overly simplistic temporal modeling strategies,\nresulting in inconsistent temporal embeddings. To overcome these challenges, we\npropose EvoFormer, an evolution-aware Transformer framework tailored for\ndynamic graph-level representation learning. To mitigate Structural Visit Bias,\nEvoFormer introduces a Structure-Aware Transformer Module that incorporates\npositional encoding based on node structural roles, allowing the model to\nglobally differentiate and accurately represent node structures. To overcome\nAbrupt Evolution Blindness, EvoFormer employs an Evolution-Sensitive Temporal\nModule, which explicitly models temporal evolution through a sequential\nthree-step strategy: (I) Random Walk Timestamp Classification, generating\ninitial timestamp-aware graph-level embeddings; (II) Graph-Level Temporal\nSegmentation, partitioning the graph stream into segments reflecting\nstructurally coherent periods; and (III) Segment-Aware Temporal Self-Attention\ncombined with an Edge Evolution Prediction task, enabling the model to\nprecisely capture segment boundaries and perceive structural evolution trends,\neffectively adapting to rapid temporal shifts.

In many cases these graphs are\ninherently heterogeneous, containing multiple node types and diverse edge\ntypes. Despite the ubiquity of such heterogeneous TAGs, there remains a lack of\nlarge-scale benchmark datasets. This shortage has become a critical bottleneck,\nhindering the development and fair comparison of representation learning\nmethods on heterogeneous text-attributed graphs. In this paper, we introduce\nCITE - Catalytic Information Textual Entities Graph, the first and largest\nheterogeneous text-attributed citation graph benchmark for catalytic materials.\nCITE comprises over 438K nodes and 1.2M edges, spanning four relation types. In\naddition, we establish standardized evaluation procedures and conduct extensive\nbenchmarking on the node classification task, as well as ablation experiments\non the heterogeneous and textual properties of CITE. We compare four classes of\nlearning paradigms, including homogeneous graph models, heterogeneous graph\nmodels, LLM(Large Language Model)-centric models, and LLM+Graph models.

In this paper, we present a hybrid framework that\nfirst generalizes across users and then rapidly adapts to individual users\nusing few-shot learning directly on-device. By updating only the classifier\nlayer with user-specific data, our method achieves robust personalization with\nminimal computational and memory overhead. We implement this framework on the\nenergy-efficient RISC-V-based GAP9 microcontroller and validate it across three\ndiverse HAR scenarios: RecGym, QVAR-Gesture, and Ultrasound-Gesture.\nPost-deployment adaptation yields consistent accuracy improvements of 3.73\\%,\n17.38\\%, and 3.70\\% respectively. These results confirm that fast, lightweight,\nand effective personalization is feasible on embedded platforms, paving the way\nfor scalable and user-aware HAR systems in the wild\n\\footnote{https://github.com/kangpx/onlineTiny2023}.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc6e8\uc5b4\ub7ec\ube14 \uc7a5\uce58\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \uc778\uac04 \ud65c\ub3d9 \uc778\uc2dd(HAR) \uae30\uc220\uc774 \ubc1c\uc804\ud588\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc5d0\uac8c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ubc30\ud3ec\ud560 \ub54c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\uc5d0 \ud55c\uacc4\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uac04 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ud6c4 \uac1c\ubcc4 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc5d0 \ube60\ub974\uac8c \uc801\uc751\ud558\ub294 \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc5d0\uac8c \ubc30\ud3ec\ub420 \ub54c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc800\ud558\ub294 \uc8fc\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc720\ub3c4 \uac1c\ub150 \ubcc0\ud654(UICD) \ub54c\ubb38\uc774\ub2e4. \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uac1c\uc778\ud654\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uac15\uc870\ub41c\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uac04 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ud6c4 \uba87 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc0f7 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uae30\uae30\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uc811 \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ud2b9\uc815 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ub958\uae30 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\ub9cc \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c HAR \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624(RecGym, QVAR-Gesture, Ultrasound-Gesture)\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4 \ud5a5\uc0c1(\uac01\uac01 3.73%, 17.38%, 3.70%)\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ube60\ub974\uace0 \uac00\ubcbc\uc6b0\uba70 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uac1c\uc778\ud654\uac00 \uc784\ubca0\ub514\ub4dc \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc5d0\uc11c \uac00\ub2a5\ud568\uc744 \ud655\uc778, \uc774\ub294 \uaddc\ubaa8 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc778\uc2dd\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c HAR \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uae38\uc744 \uc5f4\uc5b4\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6e8\uc5b4\ub7ec\ube14 \uc7a5\uce58\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \uc778\uac04 \ud65c\ub3d9 \uc778\uc2dd(HAR) \uae30\uc220\uc774 \ucd5c\uadfc \uba87 \ub144 \ub3d9\uc548 \ud06c\uac8c \ubc1c\uc804\ud588\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc5d0\uac8c \ubc30\ud3ec\ub420 \ub54c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\uac00 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \uc131\ub2a5 \uc800\ud558\ub294 \uc8fc\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc720\ub3c4 \uac1c\ub150 \ubcc0\ud654(UICD)\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uac83\uc73c\ub85c, \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uac1c\uc778\ud654\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uac15\uc870\ub41c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uba3c\uc800 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uac04 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ud55c \ud6c4 \uac1c\ubcc4 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc5d0\uac8c \ube60\ub974\uac8c \uc801\uc751\ud558\ub294 \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ud2b9\uc815 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ub958\uae30 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\ub9cc \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368, \ubcf8 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud55c\uc758 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ubc0f \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub85c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 RISC-V \uae30\ubc18 GAP9 \ub9c8\uc774\ud06c\ub85c\ucee8\ud2b8\ub864\ub7ec\uc5d0 \uad6c\ud604\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c HAR \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624(RecGym, QVAR-Gesture, Ultrasound-Gesture)\uc5d0\uc11c \uac80\uc99d\ub41c\ub2e4. \ubc30\ud3ec \ud6c4 \uc801\uc751\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uac01\uac01 3.73%, 17.38%, 3.70%\uc758 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uae30\ub85d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ube60\ub974\uace0 \uac00\ubcbc\uc6b0\uba70 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uac1c\uc778\ud654\uac00 \uc784\ubca0\ub514\ub4dc \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc5d0\uc11c \uac00\ub2a5\ud568\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8\uc758 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc778\uc2dd HAR \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uae38\uc744 \uc5f4\uc5b4\uc900\ub2e4."}}

A\n  preliminary version is under review at the NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Reliable\n  ML from Unreliable Data", "summary": "While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance\nin various domains and tasks, concerns about their safety are becoming\nincreasingly severe. In particular, since models may store unsafe knowledge\ninternally, machine unlearning has emerged as a representative paradigm to\nensure model safety. Existing approaches employ various training techniques,\nsuch as gradient ascent and negative preference optimization, in attempts to\neliminate the influence of undesired data on target models. However, these\nmethods merely suppress the activation of undesired data through parametric\ntraining without completely eradicating its informational traces within the\nmodel. This fundamental limitation makes it difficult to achieve effective\ncontinuous unlearning, rendering these methods vulnerable to relearning\nattacks. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Metamorphosis\nRepresentation Projection (MRP) approach that pioneers the application of\nirreversible projection properties to machine unlearning. By implementing\nprojective transformations in the hidden state space of specific network\nlayers, our method effectively eliminates harmful information while preserving\nuseful knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enables\neffective continuous unlearning and successfully defends against relearning\nattacks, achieving state-of-the-art performance in unlearning effectiveness\nwhile preserving natural performance.

However, they are susceptible to adversarial attacks. To\nunderstand their robustness to attacks, many local robustness verifiers have\nbeen proposed to analyze $\\epsilon$-balls of inputs. Yet, existing verifiers\nintroduce a long analysis time or lose too much precision, making them less\neffective for a large set of inputs. In this work, we propose a new approach to\nlocal robustness: group local robustness verification. The key idea is to\nleverage the similarity of the network computations of certain $\\epsilon$-balls\nto reduce the overall analysis time. We propose BaVerLy, a sound and complete\nverifier that boosts the local robustness verification of a set of\n$\\epsilon$-balls by dynamically constructing and verifying mini-batches.\nBaVerLy adaptively identifies successful mini-batch sizes, accordingly\nconstructs mini-batches of $\\epsilon$-balls that have similar network\ncomputations, and verifies them jointly. If a mini-batch is verified, all\n$\\epsilon$-balls are proven robust. Otherwise, one $\\epsilon$-ball is suspected\nas not being robust, guiding the refinement.

While recent\nretrieval-based methods embed ligands and protein pockets into Euclidean space\nfor similarity-based search, the geometry of Euclidean embeddings often fails\nto capture the hierarchical structure and fine-grained affinity variations\nintrinsic to molecular interactions. In this work, we propose HypSeek, a\nhyperbolic representation learning framework that embeds ligands, protein\npockets, and sequences into Lorentz-model hyperbolic space. By leveraging the\nexponential geometry and negative curvature of hyperbolic space, HypSeek\nenables expressive, affinity-sensitive embeddings that can effectively model\nboth global activity and subtle functional differences-particularly in\nchallenging cases such as activity cliffs, where structurally similar ligands\nexhibit large affinity gaps. Our mode unifies virtual screening and affinity\nranking in a single framework, introducing a protein-guided three-tower\narchitecture to enhance representational structure. HypSeek improves early\nenrichment in virtual screening on DUD-E from 42.63 to 51.44 (+20.7%) and\naffinity ranking correlation on JACS from 0.5774 to 0.7239 (+25.4%),\ndemonstrating the benefits of hyperbolic geometry across both tasks and\nhighlighting its potential as a powerful inductive bias for protein-ligand\nmodeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub2e8\ubc31\uc9c8-\ub9ac\uac04\ub4dc \uacb0\ud569 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ubcfc\ub9ad \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 HypSeek\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ub9ac\uac04\ub4dc\uc640 \ub2e8\ubc31\uc9c8 \uc8fc\uba38\ub2c8, \uc11c\uc5f4\uc744 \ub85c\ub80c\uce20 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ubcfc\ub9ad \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0 \uc784\ubca0\ub4dc\ud558\uc5ec \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e8\ubc31\uc9c8-\ub9ac\uac04\ub4dc \uacb0\ud569 \uc608\uce21\uc740 \uac00\uc0c1 \uc2a4\ud06c\ub9ac\ub2dd\uacfc \uce5c\ud654\ub3c4 \uc21c\uc704 \ub9e4\uae30\uae30\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud558\uba70, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc720\ud074\ub9ac\ub4dc \uacf5\uac04 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc774 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131\uc744 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \ubc18\uc601\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "HypSeek\ub294 \ub9ac\uac04\ub4dc, \ub2e8\ubc31\uc9c8 \uc8fc\uba38\ub2c8, \uc11c\uc5f4\uc744 \ub85c\ub80c\uce20 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ubcfc\ub9ad \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0 \uc784\ubca0\ub4dc\ud558\uc5ec, \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ubcfc\ub9ad \uacf5\uac04\uc758 \uc9c0\uc218 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \ud2b9\uc131\uacfc \uc74c\uc218 \uace1\ub960\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "HypSeek\ub294 DUD-E \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uac00\uc0c1 \uc2a4\ud06c\ub9ac\ub2dd\uc758 \ucd08\uae30 \ud48d\ubd80\ud568\uc744 42.63\uc5d0\uc11c 51.44\ub85c(+20.7%) \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0, JACS\uc5d0\uc11c \uce5c\ud654\ub3c4 \uc21c\uc704 \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4\ub97c 0.5774\uc5d0\uc11c 0.7239\ub85c(+25.4%) \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ubcfc\ub9ad \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc774 \ub2e8\ubc31\uc9c8-\ub9ac\uac04\ub4dc \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc5d0 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc720\ub3c4 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub2e8\ubc31\uc9c8-\ub9ac\uac04\ub4dc \uacb0\ud569 \uc608\uce21\uc740 \uc57d\ubb3c \ubc1c\uacac\uc758 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uae30\ubcf8 \uc791\uc5c5\uc778 \uac00\uc0c1 \uc2a4\ud06c\ub9ac\ub2dd \ubc0f \uce5c\ud654\ub3c4 \uc21c\uc704 \ub9e4\uae30\uae30\uc5d0 \uc911\uc2ec\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc \uac80\uc0c9 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131 \uae30\ubc18 \uac80\uc0c9\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ub9ac\uac04\ub4dc\uc640 \ub2e8\ubc31\uc9c8 \uc8fc\uba38\ub2c8\ub97c \uc720\ud074\ub9ac\ub4dc \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc720\ud074\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc758 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc740 \ubd84\uc790 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0 \ub0b4\uc7ac\ub41c \uacc4\uce35 \uad6c\uc870 \ubc0f \ubbf8\uc138 \uce5c\ud654\ub3c4 \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc885\uc885 \uc2e4\ud328\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub9ac\uac04\ub4dc, \ub2e8\ubc31\uc9c8 \uc8fc\uba38\ub2c8 \ubc0f \uc11c\uc5f4\uc744 \ub85c\ub80c\uce20 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ubcfc\ub9ad \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\ud558\ub294 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ubcfc\ub9ad \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 HypSeek\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ubcfc\ub9ad \uacf5\uac04\uc758 \uc9c0\uc218 \uae30\ud558\ud559 \ubc0f \uc74c\uc758 \uace1\ub960\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, HypSeek\uc740 \ud45c\ud604\ub825\uc774 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub098\uace0 \uce5c\ud654\ub3c4\uc5d0 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec, \uad6c\uc870\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \ub9ac\uac04\ub4dc\uac00 \ud070 \uce5c\ud654\ub3c4 \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \ubcf4\uc774\ub294 \ud65c\ub3d9 \uc808\ubcbd\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc778 \uacbd\uc6b0\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc804 \uc138\uacc4\uc801 \ud65c\ub3d9\uacfc \ubbf8\uc138\ud55c \uae30\ub2a5\uc801 \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uac00\uc0c1 \uc2a4\ud06c\ub9ac\ub2dd\uacfc \uce5c\ud654\ub3c4 \uc21c\uc704\ub97c \ub2e8\uc77c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ud45c\ud604 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub2e8\ubc31\uc9c8 \uc720\ub3c4 3\ud0c0\uc6cc \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Specifically, to ensure fairness in downstream tasks trained\non fairness-guided graphs, we introduce a differentiable community detection\ntask as a pseudo downstream task. Our theoretical analysis further demonstrates\nthat optimizing fairness within this pseudo task effectively enhances\nstructural fairness, promoting fairness generalization across diverse\ndownstream applications. Moreover, FairGuide employs an effective strategy\nwhich leverages meta-gradients derived from the fairness-guidance objective to\nidentify new links that significantly enhance structural fairness. Extensive\nexperimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our\nproposed method across a variety of graph-based fairness tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub9c1\ud06c \ub3c4\uc785\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc758 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 FairGuide\ub77c\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(GNNs)\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\uacf5\uc744 \uac70\ub450\uc5c8\uc73c\ub098, \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uad6c\uc870\uc758 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc5d0 \ud070 \ub3c4\uc804\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "FairGuide\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \uacf5\uc815\uc131 \uac00\uc774\ub4dc\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc6b4\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9bc \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubbf8\ubd84 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ud2f0 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc6b0\ub9ac \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uae30\ubc18 \uacf5\uc815\uc131 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "FairGuide\ub294 \uba54\ud0c0 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub9c1\ud06c\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(GNNs)\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0\uc11c \ub180\ub77c\uc6b4 \uc131\uacf5\uc744 \uac70\ub450\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uad6c\uc870\uc758 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc740 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \ud070 \ub3c4\uc804\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6d0\ub798\uc758 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uad6c\uc870\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3b8\ud5a5\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub9c1\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uae30\uc874 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc774 \uc5c6\ub294 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc73c\ub85c \uc548\ub0b4\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc720\ub9dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub9c1\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \uacf5\uc815\uc131 \uc720\ub3c4\ub294 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc774 \uc5c6\ub294 \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ud2f0\ub97c \ubc1c\uc804\uc2dc\ucf1c \ub2e4\uc6b4\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9bc \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc758 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 FairGuide\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \uacf5\uc815\uc131 \uc720\ub3c4 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ub2e4\uc6b4\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9bc \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc720\uc0ac \ub2e4\uc6b4\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9bc \uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c\uc11c \ubbf8\ubd84 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ud2f0 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ubd84\uc11d\uc740 \uc774 \uc720\uc0ac \uc791\uc5c5 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b4\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub2e4\uc6b4\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9bc \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uacf5\uc815\uc131 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \ucd09\uc9c4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub354\uc6b1\uc774, FairGuide\ub294 \uacf5\uc815\uc131 \uc720\ub3c4 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud30c\uc0dd\ub41c \uba54\ud0c0 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub9c1\ud06c\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ucc44\ud0dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc640 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Five key\noperational parameters were monitored: vibration, temperature, flow rate,\npressure, and electrical current. A dual-threshold labeling method was applied,\ncombining fixed engineering limits with adaptive thresholds calculated as the\n95th percentile of historical sensor values. To address the rarity of\ndocumented failures, synthetic fault signals were injected into the data using\ndomain-specific rules, simulating critical alerts within plausible operating\nranges. Three machine learning classifiers - Random Forest, Extreme Gradient\nBoosting (XGBoost), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) - were trained to\ndistinguish between normal operation, early warnings, and critical alerts.\nResults showed that Random Forest and XGBoost models achieved high accuracy\nacross all classes, including minority cases representing rare or emerging\nfaults, while the SVM model exhibited lower sensitivity to anomalies. Visual\nanalyses, including grouped confusion matrices and time-series plots, indicated\nthat the proposed hybrid method provides robust detection capabilities.

This paper introduces a novel framework, Conformalized Exceptional\nModel Mining, which combines the rigor of Conformal Prediction with the\nexplanatory power of Exceptional Model Mining (EMM). The proposed framework\nidentifies cohesive subgroups within data where model performance deviates\nexceptionally, highlighting regions of both high confidence and high\nuncertainty. We develop a new model class, mSMoPE (multiplex Soft Model\nPerformance Evaluation), which quantifies uncertainty through conformal\nprediction's rigorous coverage guarantees.

Some supervised methods\nhave improved the utilization of such spectral domain information. However,\nthey remain limited by the scarcity of labeled data due to the nature of\nanomalies. On the other hand, existing unsupervised learning approaches\npredominantly rely on spatial information or only employ low-pass filters,\nthereby losing the capacity for multi-band analysis. In this paper, we propose\nGraph Autoencoder with Spectral Encoder and Spectral Decoder (GRASPED) for node\nanomaly detection. Our unsupervised learning model features an encoder based on\nGraph Wavelet Convolution, along with structural and attribute decoders. The\nGraph Wavelet Convolution-based encoder, combined with a Wiener Graph\nDeconvolution-based decoder, exhibits bandpass filter characteristics that\ncapture global and local graph information at multiple scales.

In practice, SBI is often hindered\nby model misspecification--the mismatch between simulated and real-world\nobservations caused by inherent modeling simplifications. RoPE, a recent SBI\napproach, addresses this challenge through a two-stage domain transfer process\nthat combines semi-supervised calibration with optimal transport (OT)-based\ndistribution alignment. However, RoPE operates in a fully transductive setting,\nrequiring access to a batch of test samples at inference time, which limits\nscalability and generalization. We propose here a fully inductive and amortized\nSBI framework that integrates calibration and distributional alignment into a\nsingle, end-to-end trainable model. Our method leverages mini-batch OT with a\nclosed-form coupling to align real and simulated observations that correspond\nto the same latent parameters, using both paired calibration data and unpaired\nsamples. A conditional normalizing flow is then trained to approximate the\nOT-induced posterior, enabling efficient inference without simulation access at\ntest time.

In topic models, this translates to learning new topic\nmodels without forgetting previously learned topics. Previous work either\nconsidered Dynamic Topic Models (DTMs), which learn the evolution of topics\nbased on the entire training corpus at once, or Online Topic Models, which are\nupdated continuously based on new data but do not have long-term memory. To\nfill this gap, we propose the Continual Neural Topic Model (CoNTM), which\ncontinuously learns topic models at subsequent time steps without forgetting\nwhat was previously learned.

This paper proposes\na Bayesian approach to study the effects of algorithmic errors on key\nscientific questions, including the effect of siblings on children's language\nexperience and the association between children's production and their input.\nIn both the most commonly used \\gls{lena}, and an open-source alternative (the\nVoice Type Classifier from the ACLEW system), we find that classification\nerrors can significantly distort estimates. For instance, automated annotations\nunderestimated the negative effect of siblings on adult input by 20--80\\%,\npotentially placing it below statistical significance thresholds. We further\nshow that a Bayesian calibration approach for recovering unbiased estimates of\neffect sizes can be effective and insightful, but does not provide a fool-proof\nsolution.

Individual fairness demands that individuals differing only\nin sensitive attributes receive the same outcomes. However, commonly used\nmachine learning algorithms often fail to achieve such fairness. To improve\nindividual fairness, various training methods have been developed, such as\nincorporating fairness constraints as optimisation objectives. While these\nmethods have demonstrated empirical effectiveness, they lack formal guarantees\nof fairness. Existing approaches that aim to provide fairness guarantees\nprimarily rely on verification techniques, which can sometimes fail to produce\ndefinitive results. Moreover, verification alone does not actively enhance\nindividual fairness during training. To address this limitation, we propose a\nnovel framework that formally guarantees individual fairness throughout\ntraining. Our approach consists of two parts, i.e., (1) provably fair\ninitialisation that ensures the model starts in a fair state, and (2) a\nfairness-preserving training algorithm that maintains fairness as the model\nlearns. A key element of our method is the use of randomised response\nmechanisms, which protect sensitive attributes while maintaining fairness\nguarantees. We formally prove that this mechanism sustains individual fairness\nthroughout the training process. Experimental evaluations confirm that our\napproach is effective, i.e., producing models that are empirically fair and\naccurate. Furthermore, our approach is much more efficient than the alternative\napproach based on certified training (which requires neural network\nverification during training).", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud6c8\ub828 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uac1c\uc778 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc724\ub9ac\uc801 \uc6b0\ub824\uac00 \ucee4\uc9d0\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uac1c\uc778 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc774 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uc911\uc694\ud574\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uacf5\uc815\ud55c \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\uc791\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uace0 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \ub3d9\uc548 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc6b0\ub9ac \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uacf5\uc815\ud558\uace0 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uacf5\uc778 \ud6c8\ub828\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \ub300\uc548\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc740 \uc724\ub9ac\uc801 \uc6b0\ub824\uac00 \uacc4\uc18d \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uadf8 \uc5b4\ub290 \ub54c\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \uac1c\uc778 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc740 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \uc18d\uc131\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c \ucc28\uc774\uac00 \ub098\ub294 \uac1c\uc778\ub4e4\uc774 \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubc1b\uc544\uc57c \ud568\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\ub2e4. \uac1c\uc778 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uacf5\uc815\uc131 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud6c8\ub828 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uac1c\ubc1c\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc654\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacf5\uc2dd\uc801\uc778 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uacb0\uc5ec\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uacf5\uc815\uc131 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc8fc\ub85c \uac80\uc99d \uae30\uc220\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub54c\ub54c\ub85c \ud655\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \ub354\uad6c\ub098 \uac80\uc99d\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc911\uc5d0 \uac1c\uc778 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \uc801\uadf9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub0b4\ub0b4 \uac1c\uc778 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \uacf5\uc2dd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 (1) \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uacf5\uc815\ud55c \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\uc791\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \uc99d\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uacf5\uc815 \ucd08\uae30\ud654\uc640 (2) \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \ub3d9\uc548 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uacf5\uc815\uc131 \ubcf4\uc874 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec \uc694\uc18c\ub294 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uacf5\uc815\uc131 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ub79c\ub364\ud654 \uc751\ub2f5 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc758 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc774\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774 \ud6c8\ub828 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uac1c\uc778 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\uc9c0\ud568\uc744 \uacf5\uc2dd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc99d\uba85\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801 \ud3c9\uac00 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uacf5\uc815\ud558\uace0 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc784\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uac8c\ub2e4\uac00, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc911 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \uacf5\uc778 \ud6c8\ub828 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ub300\uc548\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud6e8\uc52c \ub354 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\ub2e4."}}

We present the Amortized In-Context Mixed-Effect\nTransformer (AICMET) model, a transformer-based latent-variable framework that\nunifies mechanistic compartmental priors with amortized in-context Bayesian\ninference. AICMET is pre-trained on hundreds of thousands of synthetic\npharmacokinetic trajectories with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck priors over the parameters\nof compartment models, endowing the model with strong inductive biases and\nenabling zero-shot adaptation to new compounds. At inference time, the decoder\nconditions on the collective context of previously profiled trial participants,\ngenerating calibrated posterior predictions for newly enrolled patients after a\nfew early drug concentration measurements.

However, one virtue of such environments is that they are\ninherently multi-agent and contain human experts. Using advanced social\nintelligence in such an environment can help an AI agent learn adaptive skills\nand behaviors that a known expert exhibits. While social intelligence could\naccelerate training, it is currently difficult to study due to the lack of\nopen-ended multi-agent environments. In this work, we present an environment in\nwhich multiple self-interested agents can pursue complex and independent goals,\nreflective of real world challenges. This environment will enable research into\nthe development of socially intelligent AI agents in open-ended multi-agent\nsettings, where agents may be implicitly incentivized to cooperate to defeat\ncommon enemies, build and share tools, and achieve long horizon goals. In this\nwork, we investigate the impact on agent performance due to social learning in\nthe presence of experts and implicit cooperation such as emergent collaborative\ntool use, and whether agents can benefit from either cooperation or competition\nin this environment.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI \uc694\uc6d0\ub4e4\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc30\uce58\ub418\uae30 \uc804\uc5d0 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub3c4\uc804\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc9c4\ud654\ub41c \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc774 \uadf8\ub7ec\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc801\uc751\ub825\uc744 \ub192\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc5d0 \uc8fc\ubaa9\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uac00 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c AI \uc694\uc6d0\uc758 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AI \uc694\uc6d0\ub4e4\uc774 \uc2e4\uc81c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc5ec\ub7ec \uc790\uc544 \uc774\uc775\uc744 \uc9c0\ub2cc \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc774 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud558\uace0 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ucd94\uad6c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc640 \ud611\ub825\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5\uc774 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uace0 \ud611\ub825\uc774\ub098 \uacbd\uc7c1 \uc5b4\ub290 \ucabd\uc774 \ub354 \uc720\ub9ac\ud55c\uc9c0 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 AI \uc694\uc6d0\uc774 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc778 \ud611\ub825 \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ub0bc \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc2e4\uc81c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc30\uce58\ub418\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uac00\uc9c0 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc758 \ud55c \uac00\uc9c0 \ubbf8\ub355\uc740 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc774\uba70 \uc778\uac04 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uac00 \ud3ec\ud568\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uace0\uae09 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc54c\ub824\uc9c4 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uac00 \ubcf4\uc774\ub294 \uc801\uc751 \uae30\uc220\uacfc \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc774 \ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc774 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud604\uc7ac \uc5f4\ub9b0 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud658\uacbd\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uc5ec \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub835\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc790\uc544 \uc774\uc775\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc774 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud558\uace0 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ucd94\uad6c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc138\uacc4\uc758 \ub3c4\uc804\uc744 \ubc18\uc601\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud658\uacbd\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc774 \uacf5\ud1b5\uc758 \uc801\uc744 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uce58\uace0, \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uace0 \uacf5\uc720\ud558\uba70, \uc7a5\uae30 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud611\ub825\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ubb35\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\ub3c4\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc5f4\ub9b0 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc801\uc778 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uac1c\ubc1c \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud560 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uac00 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\ub294 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5\uc774 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uace0, \ud611\ub825 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc758 emergence\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ubb35\uc2dc\uc801 \ud611\ub3d9\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc774 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ud611\ub825 \ub610\ub294 \uacbd\uc7c1\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc774\ub4dd\uc744 \uc5bb\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc0b4\ud3b4\ubd05\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

First, we generalize the augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) to support\nmultiple independent penalty parameters, enabling simultaneous enforcement of\nheterogeneous constraints. Second, we reformulate pointwise constraint\nenforcement and Lagrange multipliers as expectations over constraint terms,\nreducing memory overhead and permitting efficient mini-batch training. Third,\nto address PDEs with oscillatory, multi-scale features, we incorporate Fourier\nfeature mappings and show that a single mapping suffices where multiple\nmappings or more costly architectures were required in related methods. Fourth,\nwe introduce a time-windowing strategy for long-time evolution in which the\nterminal state of each window is enforced as an initial-condition constraint\nfor the next, ensuring continuity without discrete time models. Crucially, we\npropose a conditionally adaptive penalty update (CAPU) strategy for ALM, which\npreserves the principle that larger constraint violations incur stronger\npenalties. CAPU accelerates the growth of Lagrange multipliers for selectively\nchallenging constraints, enhancing constraint enforcement during training. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of PECANN-CAPU on problems including the\ntransonic rarefaction problem, reversible advection of a passive by a vortex,\nhigh-wavenumber Helmholtz and Poisson equations, and inverse identification of\nspatially varying heat sources. Comparisons with established methods and recent\nKolmogorov-Arnold network approaches show that PECANN-CAPU achieves competitive\naccuracy across all cases.

No improvements in the RBM\ntraining are achieved in this work, thereby suggesting that the differences\nbetween the QA-based and MCMC sampling, mainly found in the medium-to-low\nprobability regions of the distribution, which are less important for the\nquality of the sample, are insufficient to benefit the training. Difficulties\nin achieving sufficiently high quality of embedding RBMs into the lattice of\nthe newer generation of D-Wave hardware could be further complicating the task.\nOn the other hand, the ability to generate samples of sufficient variety from\nlower-probability parts of the distribution has a potential to benefit other\nmachine learning applications, such as the mitigation of catastrophic\nforgetting (CF) during incremental learning. The feasibility of using\nQA-generated patterns of desirable classes for CF mitigation by the generative\nreplay is demonstrated in this work for the first time. While the efficiency of\nthe CF mitigation using the D-Wave QA was comparable to that of the classical\nmitigation, both the speed of generating a large number of distinct desirable\npatterns and the potential for further improvement make this approach promising\nfor a variety of challenging machine learning applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 D-Wave \uc591\uc790

Despite reducing communication frequency, these\nmethods still typically require communicating a full copy of the model's\ngradients-resulting in a communication bottleneck even for cross-datacenter\nlinks. Furthermore, they can slightly degrade performance compared to a naive\nAdamW DDP baseline. While quantization and error feedback are often applied to\nreduce the pseudo-gradient's size, in the context of LLM pre-training, existing\napproaches have been unable to additionally leverage sparsification and have\nobtained limited quantization. In this work, we introduce SparseLoCo, a\ncommunication-efficient training algorithm for LLMs that effectively leverages\nTop-k sparsification and quantization to reach extreme compression ratios of up\nto 1-3% sparsity and 2-bit quantization while outperforming full-precision\nDiLoCo. Our key observations are that outer momentum can be locally\napproximated by an error feedback combined with aggressive sparsity and that\nsparse aggregation can actually improve model performance.

A critical safety component is out-of-distribution\ndetection: given an input, decide whether it comes from the same distribution\nas the training data. In generative models, the most natural OOD score is the\ndata likelihood. Actually, under the assumption of uniformly distributed OOD\ndata, the likelihood is even the optimal OOD detector, as we show in this work.\nHowever, earlier work reported that likelihood often fails in practice, raising\ndoubts about its usefulness. We explore whether, in practice, the\nrepresentation space also suffers from the inability to learn good density\nestimation for OOD detection, or if it is merely a problem of the pixel space\ntypically used in generative models. To test this, we trained a Variational\nDiffusion Model not on images, but on the representation space of a pre-trained\nResNet-18 to assess the performance of our likelihood-based detector in\ncomparison to state-of-the-art methods from the OpenOOD suite.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI\uc758 \uae09\uc18d\ud55c \ubc1c\uc804\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \uc548\uc804 \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ubc30\uce58\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \ubcd1\ubaa9\ud604\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ub0a8\uc544\uc788\ub2e4.

However, in high-value but\nmore challenging scientific professional fields, either the fields still rely\non expert models, or the progress of general foundation models lags\nsignificantly compared to those in popular areas, far from sufficient for\ntransforming scientific research and leaving substantial gap between\nopen-source models and closed-source models in these scientific domains. To\nmitigate this gap and explore a step further toward Artificial General\nIntelligence (AGI), we introduce Intern-S1, a specialized generalist equipped\nwith general understanding and reasoning capabilities with expertise to analyze\nmultiple science modal data. Intern-S1 is a multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)\nmodel with 28 billion activated parameters and 241 billion total parameters,\ncontinually pre-trained on 5T tokens, including over 2.5T tokens from\nscientific domains. In the post-training stage, Intern-S1 undergoes offline and\nthen online reinforcement learning (RL) in InternBootCamp, where we propose\nMixture-of-Rewards (MoR) to synergize the RL training on more than 1000 tasks\nsimultaneously. Through integrated innovations in algorithms, data, and\ntraining systems, Intern-S1 achieved top-tier performance in online RL\ntraining.On comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, Intern-S1 demonstrates\ncompetitive performance on general reasoning tasks among open-source models and\nsignificantly outperforms open-source models in scientific domains, surpassing\nclosed-source state-of-the-art models in professional tasks, such as molecular\nsynthesis planning, reaction condition prediction, predicting thermodynamic\nstabilities for crystals.
