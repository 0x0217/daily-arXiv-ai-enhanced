We explore an\nalternative view: use LLMs to write code that leverages decades of numerical\nalgorithms. This shifts the burden from learning a solution function to making\ndomain-aware numerical choices. We ask whether LLMs can act as SciML agents\nthat, given a natural-language ODE description, generate runnable code that is\nscientifically appropriate, selecting suitable solvers (stiff vs. non-stiff),\nand enforcing stability checks. There is currently no benchmark to measure this\nkind of capability for scientific computing tasks. As such, we first introduce\ntwo new datasets: a diagnostic dataset of adversarial \"misleading\" problems;\nand a large-scale benchmark of 1,000 diverse ODE tasks. The diagnostic set\ncontains problems whose superficial appearance suggests stiffness, and that\nrequire algebraic simplification to demonstrate non-stiffness; and the\nlarge-scale benchmark spans stiff and non-stiff ODE regimes. We evaluate open-\nand closed-source LLM models along two axes: (i) unguided versus guided\nprompting with domain-specific knowledge; and (ii) off-the-shelf versus\nfine-tuned variants. Our evaluation measures both executability and numerical\nvalidity against reference solutions. We find that with sufficient context and\nguided prompts, newer instruction-following models achieve high accuracy on\nboth criteria. In many cases, recent open-source systems perform strongly\nwithout fine-tuning, while older or smaller models still benefit from\nfine-tuning.

To address these challenges, Robust\nMDPs (RMDPs) offer a principled framework for planning under model uncertainty,\nyet existing approaches are typically computationally intensive and not suited\nfor real-time use. In this work, we introduce Robust Sparse Sampling (RSS), the\nfirst online planning algorithm for RMDPs with finite-sample theoretical\nperformance guarantees.

Their core weakness is a fundamental\ninability to perform robust counterfactual reasoning: to determine if\ncorrecting a single action would have actually averted the task failure. To\nbridge this counterfactual inference gap, we introduce Abduct-Act-Predict (A2P)\nScaffolding, a novel agent framework that transforms failure attribution from\npattern recognition into a structured causal inference task.
