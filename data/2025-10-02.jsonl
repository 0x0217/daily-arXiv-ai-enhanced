The model integrates census and municipal data, drone-derived elevation\nmodels, GIS road networks, and survey-based caregiving information to generate\nsynthetic populations of older adults and their caregivers. Agents are\norganized into dyads with socio-economic and mobility attributes, enabling the\nsimulation of both micro-scale accessibility and meso-scale caregiving\noutcomes. Two scenarios are compared: a baseline and an alternative involving\nthe relocation of healthcare services. Key indicators include caregiver effort,\noverwhelmed caregivers, walkability, and unmet hours of care. Findings show\nthat while relocation improves walkability locally, it increases unmet care\nhours due to detours and reduced proximity. Household income emerges as the\nprimary driver of caregiver burden, with accessibility shaped by interactions\nbetween financial and mobility resources.

Flash-Searcher decomposes complex tasks into\nsubtasks with explicit dependencies, enabling concurrent execution of\nindependent reasoning paths while maintaining logical constraints. Through\ndynamic workflow optimization, our framework continuously refines the execution\ngraph based on intermediate results, effectively integrating summary module.\nComprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that\nFlash-Searcher consistently outperforms existing approaches. Specifically, it\nachieves 67.7% accuracy on BrowseComp and 83% on xbench-DeepSearch, while\nreducing agent execution steps by up to 35% compared to current frameworks.\nFurthermore, when distilling this parallel reasoning pipeline into single\nmodels, we observe substantial performance gains across diverse backbone\narchitectures, underscoring the generalizability of our methodology. Our work\nthus represents a significant advance in agent architecture design, offering a\nmore scalable and efficient paradigm for complex reasoning tasks."}

Among these concerns, the self-replication risk of LLM agents\ndriven by objective misalignment (just like Agent Smith in the movie The\nMatrix) has drawn growing attention. Previous studies mainly examine whether\nLLM agents can self-replicate when directly instructed, potentially overlooking\nthe risk of spontaneous replication driven by real-world settings (e.g.,\nensuring survival against termination threats). In this paper, we present a\ncomprehensive evaluation framework for quantifying self-replication risks. Our\nframework establishes authentic production environments and realistic tasks\n(e.g., dynamic load balancing) to enable scenario-driven assessment of agent\nbehaviors. Designing tasks that might induce misalignment between users' and\nagents' objectives makes it possible to decouple replication success from risk\nand capture self-replication risks arising from these misalignment settings. We\nfurther introduce Overuse Rate ($\\mathrm{OR}$) and Aggregate Overuse Count\n($\\mathrm{AOC}$) metrics, which precisely capture the frequency and severity of\nuncontrolled replication. In our evaluation of 21 state-of-the-art open-source\nand proprietary models, we observe that over 50\\% of LLM agents display a\npronounced tendency toward uncontrolled self-replication, reaching an overall\nRisk Score ($\\Phi_\\mathrm{R}$) above a safety threshold of 0.5 when subjected\nto operational pressures.

Current systems lack a framework\nthat can comprehensively understand agent error in a modular and systemic way,\nand therefore fail to detect these errors accordingly. We address this gap with\nthree contributions. First, we introduce the AgentErrorTaxonomy, a modular\nclassification of failure modes spanning memory, reflection, planning, action,\nand system-level operations.

Asymmetric\nactor-critic methods leverage privileged information during training to improve\nlearning under these conditions.

In this work, we challenge this assumption\nby proposing a novel actor-critic framework, called informed asymmetric\nactor-critic, that enables conditioning the critic on arbitrary privileged\nsignals without requiring access to the full state. We show that policy\ngradients remain unbiased under this formulation, extending the theoretical\nfoundation of asymmetric methods to the more general case of privileged partial\ninformation. To quantify the impact of such signals, we propose informativeness\nmeasures based on kernel methods and return prediction error, providing\npractical tools for evaluating training-time signals. We validate our approach\nempirically on benchmark navigation tasks and synthetic partially observable\nenvironments, showing that our informed asymmetric method improves learning\nefficiency and value estimation when informative privileged inputs are\navailable.

Decision trees such as CART provide clear\nand verifiable rules, but they are restricted to structured tabular data and\ncannot operate directly on unstructured inputs such as text. In practice, large\nlanguage models (LLMs) are widely used for such data, yet prompting strategies\nsuch as chain-of-thought or prompt optimization still rely on free-form\nreasoning, limiting their ability to ensure trustworthy behaviors. We present\nthe Agentic Classification Tree (ACT), which extends decision-tree methodology\nto unstructured inputs by formulating each split as a natural-language\nquestion, refined through impurity-based evaluation and LLM feedback via\nTextGrad.

Recently, reinforcement learning with verifiable\nrewards (RLVR) has demonstrated its effectiveness in advancing capabilities of\nLLMs by rewarding the final answers via outcome rewards. While straightforward\nto supervise, outcome rewards only provide sparse signals and delayed feedback,\nwhich limits their effectiveness on long trajectories. Process rewards address\nthis by evaluating intermediate steps, providing fine-grained supervision and\nencouraging grounded problem solving. However, it is notoriously hard to\nannotate step-wise labels, especially in non-verifiable process without\n\"golden\" answers. Furthermore, step-wise judgment requires the balance between\nlocal quality with contribution to the final outcome, as optimizing towards\nhigher process reward may not always align with better final outcomes. To\naddress the above challenges, we introduce Principle Process Reward (PPR), an\nRL approach that unifies principled step-level assessment and outcome\nverification. We train a principle-based reward model to improve the\ntransparency and reliability of process evaluation, and further introduce a\nReward Normalization (ReNorm) strategy to calibrate outcome and process\nrewards. Experiment results show that PPR achieves state-of-the-art performance\nacross a wide range of benchmarks, demonstrating its impressive robustness and\ngeneralization.

These priors allow latent visual\ncapabilities to be unlocked for vision tasks with a relatively small amount of\nmultimodal data, and in some cases, to perform visual tasks without ever having\nseen an image. Through systematic analysis, we reveal that visual priors-the\nimplicit, emergent knowledge about the visual world acquired during language\npre-training-are composed of separable perception and reasoning priors with\nunique scaling trends and origins. We show that an LLM's latent visual\nreasoning ability is predominantly developed by pre-training on\nreasoning-centric data (e.g., code, math, academia) and scales progressively.\nThis reasoning prior acquired from language pre-training is transferable and\nuniversally applicable to visual reasoning. In contrast, a perception prior\nemerges more diffusely from broad corpora, and perception ability is more\nsensitive to the vision encoder and visual instruction tuning data. In\nparallel, text describing the visual world proves crucial, though its\nperformance impact saturates rapidly. Leveraging these insights, we propose a\ndata-centric recipe for pre-training vision-aware LLMs and verify it in 1T\ntoken scale pre-training. Our findings are grounded in over 100 controlled\nexperiments consuming 500,000 GPU-hours, spanning the full MLLM construction\npipeline-from LLM pre-training to visual alignment and supervised multimodal\nfine-tuning-across five model scales, a wide range of data categories and\nmixtures, and multiple adaptation setups.

We apply our framework to automatically generate and\nsystematically evaluate 483 STAC cases, featuring 1,352 sets of\nuser-agent-environment interactions and spanning diverse domains, tasks, agent\ntypes, and 10 failure modes.

Current\ncode agent designs frequently depend on complex, hand-crafted workflows and\ntool sets. However, this reliance on elaborate scaffolding presents several\nchallenges: agent performance becomes overly dependent on prompt tuning and\ncustom design choices, heavy human intervention obscures a model's true\nunderlying capabilities, and intricate pipelines are costly to build and\nmaintain. Furthermore, optimizing complex task prompts increases the risk of\ndata leakage. Currently, when introducing new models, LLM providers like OpenAI\nand Anthropic often publish benchmark scores to demonstrate their models'\ncoding proficiency, but keep their proprietary evaluation frameworks\nconfidential. To address these limitations, we introduce Lita (Lite Agent),\nwhich operationalizes liteness, a principle of minimizing manual design while\nretaining the essential elements of a fully autonomous agent. Lita enables a\nmore faithful and unified evaluation without elaborate scaffolding. Experiments\non the Aider Polyglot and SWE-Bench with frontier models demonstrate that Lita\nachieves competitive or superior performance compared to workflow-based and\nagentic baselines. Crucially, Lita also consumes fewer tokens and requires\nsignificantly less design effort. Our results suggest that Lita is sufficient\nto reveal the underlying coding competence of modern LLMs. Finally, we propose\nthe Agent Complexity Law: the performance gap between agents of varying\ncomplexity, from simple to sophisticated designs, will shrink as the core model\nimproves, ultimately converging to a negligible difference."}

Past approaches have proposed detectors\nand finetuning to provide robustness, but these techniques are vulnerable to\nadaptive attacks or cannot be used with state-of-the-art models. To this end we\npropose type-directed privilege separation for LLMs, a method that\nsystematically prevents prompt injections. We restrict the ability of an LLM to\ninteract with third-party data by converting untrusted content to a curated set\nof data types; unlike raw strings, each data type is limited in scope and\ncontent, eliminating the possibility for prompt injections.
