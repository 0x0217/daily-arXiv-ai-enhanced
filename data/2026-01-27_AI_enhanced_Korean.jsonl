Leveraging verifiable credentials and zero-knowledge proof techniques, FC-GUARD enables fiat-to-cryptocurrency exchanges without revealing users' PII or fiat account details. This breaks the linkage between users' real-world identities and their cryptocurrency addresses, thereby upholding anonymity, a fundamental expectation in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. In addition, FC-GUARD complies with key regulations over cryptocurrency usage, such as know-your-customer requirements and auditability for tax reporting obligations by integrating a lawful de-anonymization mechanism that allows the auditing authority to identify misbehaving users. This ensures regulatory compliance while defaulting to privacy protection.

However, intelligent attacks represented by semantic eavesdropping pose severe challenges to the security of SemCom. To address this challenge, Semantic Steganographic Communication (SemSteCom) achieves ``invisible'' encryption by implicitly embedding private semantic information into cover modality carriers. The state-of-the-art study has further introduced generative diffusion models to directly generate stega images without relying on original cover images, effectively enhancing steganographic capacity. Nevertheless, the recovery process of private images is highly dependent on the guidance of private semantic keys, which may be inferred by intelligent eavesdroppers, thereby introducing new security threats. To address this issue, we propose an Agentic AI-driven SemSteCom (AgentSemSteCom) scheme, which includes semantic extraction, digital token controlled reference image generation, coverless steganography, semantic codec, and optional task-oriented enhancement modules. The proposed AgentSemSteCom scheme obviates the need for both cover images and private semantic keys, thereby boosting steganographic capacity while reinforcing transmission security. The simulation results on open-source datasets verify that, AgentSemSteCom achieves better transmission quality and higher security levels than the baseline scheme.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 Semantic Steganographic Communication(\uc138\uba58\ud2f1 \uc2a4\ud14c\uac00\ub178\uadf8\ub798\ud53d \ud1b5\uc2e0) \ud37c\uc5d0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI \uae30\ubc18 SemSteCom \uc2a4\ud0b4\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ubcf4\uc548\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uc2a4\ud14c\uac00\ub178\uadf8\ub798\ud53c \uc6a9\ub7c9\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "SemCom\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c SemSteCom \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ucee4\ubc84 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uc640 \ube44\uacf5\uc2dd\uc801\uc778 \uac1c\uc778 \uc758\ubbf8 \ud0a4 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc124\uacc4\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "result": "AgentSemSteCom \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\uc2dd\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc804\uc1a1 \ud488\uc9c8\uacfc \ub192\uc740 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc218\uc900\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc2a4\ud14c\uac00\ub178\uadf8\ub798\ud53c \uc6a9\ub7c9\uc744 \uc99d\ub300\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uae30\uc5ec\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc758\ubbf8 \ud1b5\uc2e0(SemCom)\uc740 \uc804\uc1a1 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc7a5\uc810\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubbf8\ub798\uc758 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uac04\uacb0\ud55c \ubb34\uc120 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud575\uc2ec \uae30\uc220\ub85c \ub5a0\uc62c\ub790\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc758\ubbf8 \ub3c4\uccad\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub098\ub294 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9\uc740 SemCom\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548\uc5d0 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804\uc744 \uc81c\uae30\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804\uc5d0 \ub300\uc751\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc2a4\ud14c\uac00\ub178\uadf8\ub798\ud53d \ud1b5\uc2e0(SemSteCom)\uc740 \uac1c\uc778 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ucee4\ubc84 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0 \uce90\ub9ac\uc5b4\uc5d0 \uc554\ubb35\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0bd\uc785\ud558\uc5ec '\ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294' \uc554\ud638\ud654\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc6d0\ub798 \ucee4\ubc84 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub97c \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc2a4\ud14c\uac00 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub97c \uc9c1\uc811 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc0dd\uc131\uc801 \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc2a4\ud14c\uac00\ub178\uadf8\ub798\ud53c \uc6a9\ub7c9\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf30\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7fc\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \uac1c\uc778 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub97c \ubcf5\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \uacfc\uc815\uc740 \uac1c\uc778 \uc758\ubbf8 \ud0a4\uc758 \uc9c0\uce68\uc5d0 \ud06c\uac8c \uc758\uc874\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc801 \ub3c4\uccad\uc790\uac00 \ucd94\ub860\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc704\ud611\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc758\ubbf8 \ucd94\ucd9c, \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \ud1a0\ud070 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ucc38\uc870 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uc0dd\uc131, \ucee4\ubc84 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc2a4\ud14c\uac00\ub178\uadf8\ub798\ud53c, \uc758\ubbf8 \ucf54\ub371 \ubc0f \uc120\ud0dd\uc801 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc9c0\ud5a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1 \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI \uad6c\ub3d9 SemSteCom(AgentSemSteCom) \uccb4\uacc4\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc548\ub41c AgentSemSteCom \uccb4\uacc4\ub294 \ucee4\ubc84 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uc640 \uac1c\uc778 \uc758\ubbf8 \ud0a4\ub97c \ubaa8\ub450 \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\ubbc0\ub85c \uc2a4\ud14c\uac00\ub178\uadf8\ub798\ud53c \uc6a9\ub7c9\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uc804\uc1a1 \ubcf4\uc548\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacf5\uac1c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 AgentSemSteCom\uc774 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\uc2dd\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc804\uc1a1 \ud488\uc9c8\uacfc \ub192\uc740 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc218\uc900\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \uac80\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

In practice, reproducing such attacks requires manually crafting proofs-of-concept (PoCs), a labor-intensive process that demands substantial expertise and scales poorly. In this work, we present the first automated framework for synthesizing verifiable PoCs directly from on-chain attack executions. Our key insight is that attacker logic can be recovered from low-level transaction traces via trace-driven reverse engineering, and then translated into executable exploits by leveraging the code-generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs). To this end, we propose TracExp, which localizes attack-relevant execution contexts from noisy, multi-contract traces and introduces a novel dual-decompiler to transform concrete executions into semantically enriched exploit pseudocode. Guided by this representation, TracExp synthesizes PoCs and refines them to preserve exploitability-relevant semantics. We evaluate TracExp on 321 real-world attacks over the past 20 months. TracExp successfully synthesizes PoCs for 93% of incidents, with 58.78% being directly verifiable, at an average cost of only \\$0.07 per case. Moreover, TracExp enabled the release of a large number of previously unavailable PoCs to the community, earning a $900 bounty and demonstrating strong practical impact.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ube14\ub85d\uccb4\uc778 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \uc545\uc6a9\ud55c \uc628\uccb4\uc778 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c PoC \uc0dd\uc131 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 TracExp\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc628\uccb4\uc778 \uacf5\uaca9\uc758 \uc7ac\ud604\uc774 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6cc\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc218\uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c PoC\ub97c \ub9cc\ub4dc\ub294 \ub370 \ub9ce\uc740 \ub178\ub825\uacfc \uc804\ubb38 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc774 \uc694\uad6c\ub41c\ub2e4.", "method": "TracExp\ub294 \uc800\uc218\uc900 \ud2b8\ub79c\uc7ad\uc158 \ucd94\uc801\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uacf5\uaca9\uc790 \ub17c\ub9ac\ub97c \ubcf5\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 LLM\uc758 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc775\uc2a4\ud50c\ub85c\uc787\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "321\uac74\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0\uc11c 93%\uc758 \uc0ac\uac74\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 PoC\ub97c \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ud588\uc73c\uba70, \uc774 \uc911 58.78%\ub294 \uc9c1\uc811 \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "TracExp\ub294 0.07\ub2ec\ub7ec\uc758 \ud3c9\uade0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\ucce4\uace0, \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ud2f0\uc5d0 \uc774\uc804\uc5d0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\uc5c8\ub358 PoCs\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud588\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ube14\ub85d\uccb4\uc778 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uacc4\uc57d \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \uc545\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac00\uce58\ub97c \ube60\ub974\uace0 \uc740\ubc00\ud558\uac8c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\ub294 \uc628\uccb4\uc778 \uacf5\uaca9\uc758 \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc774 \uc9c0\ubaa9\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \ubd84\uc11d\uacfc \uc7ac\ud604\uc774 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6cc\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc2e4\uc81c\ub85c \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \uc7ac\ud604\ud558\ub824\uba74 \uc218\uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \uac1c\ub150 \uc99d\uba85(PoC)\uc744 \ub9cc\ub4e4\uc5b4\uc57c \ud558\ub294\ub370, \uc774\ub294 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc804\ubb38 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uace0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ub178\ub3d9 \uc9d1\uc57d\uc801\uc778 \uacfc\uc815\uc774\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc628\uccb4\uc778 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc2e4\ud589\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c1\uc811 \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c PoC\ub97c \ud569\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc740 \uacf5\uaca9\uc790\uc758 \ub17c\ub9ac\ub97c \uc800\uc218\uc900 \ud2b8\ub79c\uc7ad\uc158 \ucd94\uc801\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf5\uad6c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud574 \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc775\uc2a4\ud50c\ub85c\uc787\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud574 TracExp\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc2dc\ub044\ub7fd\uace0 \ub2e4\uc911 \uacc4\uc57d \ucd94\uc801\uc5d0\uc11c \uacf5\uaca9 \uad00\ub828 \uc2e4\ud589 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc744 \uc9c0\uc5ed\ud654\ud558\uace0, \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc778 \uc2e4\ud589\uc744 \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \uc775\uc2a4\ud50c\ub85c\uc787 \uc758\uc0ac \ucf54\ub4dc\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc774\uc911 \ub514\ucef4\ud30c\uc77c\ub7ec\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud45c\ud604\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc548\ub0b4\ubc1b\uc544 TracExp\ub294 PoC\ub97c \ud569\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \uc815\uc81c\ud558\uc5ec \uc775\uc2a4\ud50c\ub85c\uc787 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ub41c \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc744 \ubcf4\uc874\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc9c0\ub09c 20\uac1c\uc6d4 \ub3d9\uc548 321\uac74\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0\uc11c TracExp\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, TracExp\ub294 93%\uc758 \uc0ac\uac74\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 PoC\ub97c \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud569\uc131\ud558\uc600\uace0, \uc774 \uc911 58.78%\ub294 \uc9c1\uc811 \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud588\uc73c\uba70, \ud3c9\uade0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc740 \ub2e8 0.07\ub2ec\ub7ec\uc5d0 \ubd88\uacfc\ud558\ub2e4. \ub354\uc6b1\uc774 TracExp\ub294 \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ud2f0\uc5d0 \uc774\uc804\uc5d0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\uc5c8\ub358 \ub9ce\uc740 PoCs\ub97c \ub9b4\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud588\uace0, $900\uc758 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \ubc1b\uc73c\uba70 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc801 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud588\ub2e4."}}

Adapts and extends complex actor material from Pant (2021) doctoral dissertation, University of Toronto", "summary": "Mixed-motive multi-agent settings are rife with persistent free-riding because individual effort benefits all members equally, yet each member bears the full cost of their own contribution. Classical work by Holmstr\u00f6m established that under pure self-interest, Nash equilibrium is universal shirking. While i* represents teams as composite actors, it lacks scalable computational mechanisms for analyzing how collective action problems emerge and resolve in coopetitive settings. This technical report extends computational foundations for strategic coopetition to team-level dynamics, building on companion work formalizing interdependence/complementarity (arXiv:2510.18802) and trust dynamics (arXiv:2510.24909). We develop loyalty-moderated utility functions with two mechanisms: loyalty benefit (welfare internalization plus intrinsic contribution satisfaction) and cost tolerance (reduced effort burden for loyal members). We integrate i* structural dependencies through dependency-weighted team cohesion, connecting member incentives to team-level positioning. The framework applies to both human teams (loyalty as psychological identification) and multi-agent systems (alignment coefficients and adjusted cost functions). Experimental validation across 3,125 configurations demonstrates robust loyalty effects (15.04x median effort differentiation).

To address these challenges, we introduce PyHealth 2.0, an enhanced clinical deep learning toolkit that enables predictive modeling in as few as 7 lines of code. PyHealth 2.0 offers three key contributions: (1) a comprehensive toolkit addressing reproducibility and compatibility challenges by unifying 15+ datasets, 20+ clinical tasks, 25+ models, 5+ interpretability methods, and uncertainty quantification including conformal prediction within a single framework that supports diverse clinical data modalities - signals, imaging, and electronic health records - with translation of 5+ medical coding standards; (2) accessibility-focused design accommodating multimodal data and diverse computational resources with up to 39x faster processing and 20x lower memory usage, enabling work from 16GB laptops to production systems; and (3) an active open-source community of 400+ members lowering domain expertise barriers through extensive documentation, reproducible research contributions, and collaborations with academic health systems and industry partners, including multi-language support via RHealth. PyHealth 2.0 establishes an open-source foundation and community advancing accessible, reproducible healthcare AI.

We introduce a comprehensive diagnostic framework that leverages big data analytics to evaluate procedural reliability in intelligent agent systems, addressing critical needs for SME-centric deployment in privacy-sensitive environments. Our approach features a 12-category error taxonomy capturing failure modes across tool initialization, parameter handling, execution, and result interpretation. Through systematic evaluation of 1,980 deterministic test instances spanning both open-weight models (Qwen2.5 series, Functionary) and proprietary alternatives (GPT-4, Claude 3.5/3.7) across diverse edge hardware configurations, we identify actionable reliability thresholds for production deployment. Our analysis reveals that procedural reliability, particularly tool initialization failures, constitutes the primary bottleneck for smaller models, while qwen2.5:32b achieves flawless performance matching GPT-4.1. The framework demonstrates that mid-sized models (qwen2.5:14b) offer practical accuracy-efficiency trade-offs on commodity hardware (96.6\\% success rate, 7.3 s latency), enabling cost-effective intelligent agent deployment for resource-constrained organizations.

This paper introduces a cyber-risk management framework for networked digital systems that combines the strategic behavior of players with contagion dynamics within a security game. We address the problem of optimally allocating cybersecurity resources across a network, focusing on the heterogeneous valuations of nodes by attackers and defenders, some areas may be of high interest to the attacker, while others are prioritized by the defender. We explore how this asymmetry drives attack and defense strategies and shapes the system's overall resilience. We extend a method to determine optimal resource allocation based on simple network metrics weighted by the defender's and attacker's risk profiles.

However, Python-based ABM frameworks face a fundamental tension between the accessibility that has made Python dominant in scientific computing and the performance requirements of large-scale simulations. This paper introduces AMBER, a framework that resolves this tension through a novel architectural approach: replacing the conventional object-per-agent representation with columnar state management using the Polars DataFrame library. We analyze the computational characteristics of both paradigms, present the architectural design of AMBER including its core abstractions, spatial environments, experiment management, and optimization capabilities. Empirical evaluation on three canonical benchmarks demonstrates that AMBER achieves speedups of 1.2x to 93x depending on workload characteristics, with the greatest advantages for models dominated by population-wide attribute operations. Memory profiling reveals 30-50% reduction in peak usage compared to object-oriented frameworks.

Current terminal benchmarks were built for evaluation, not training; reinforcement learning requires a scalable pipeline, not just a dataset. We introduce Endless Terminals, a fully autonomous pipeline that procedurally generates terminal-use tasks without human annotation. The pipeline has four stages: generating diverse task descriptions, building and validating containerized environments, producing completion tests, and filtering for solvability. From this pipeline we obtain 3255 tasks spanning file operations, log management, data processing, scripting, and database operations. We train agents using vanilla PPO with binary episode level rewards and a minimal interaction loop: no retrieval, multi-agent coordination, or specialized tools. Despite this simplicity, models trained on Endless Terminals show substantial gains: on our held-out dev set, Llama-3.2-3B improves from 4.0% to 18.2%, Qwen2.5-7B from 10.7% to 53.3%, and Qwen3-8B-openthinker-sft from 42.6% to 59.0%. These improvements transfer to human-curated benchmarks: models trained on Endless Terminals show substantial gains on held out human curated benchmarks: on TerminalBench 2.0, Llama-3.2-3B improves from 0.0% to 2.2%, Qwen2.5-7B from 2.2% to 3.4%, and Qwen3-8B-openthinker-sft from 1.1% to 6.7%, in each case outperforming alternative approaches including models with more complex agentic scaffolds.

Conventional boundary caching fails to capture this inefficiency because it treats inference as a monolithic black box.\n  We introduce SemanticALLI, a pipeline-aware architecture within Alli (PMG's marketing intelligence platform), designed to operationalize redundant reasoning. By decomposing generation into Analytic Intent Resolution (AIR) and Visualization Synthesis (VS), SemanticALLI elevates structured intermediate representations (IRs) to first-class, cacheable artifacts.\n  The impact of caching within the agentic loop is substantial. In our evaluation, baseline monolithic caching caps at a 38.7% hit rate due to linguistic variance. In contrast, our structured approach allows for an additional stage, the Visualization Synthesis stage, to achieve an 83.10% hit rate, bypassing 4,023 LLM calls with a median latency of just 2.66 ms. This internal reuse reduces total token consumption, offering a practical lesson for AI system design: even when users rarely repeat themselves, the pipeline often does, at stable, structured checkpoints where caching is most reliable.", "AI": {"tldr": "SemanticALLI\ub294 \uc911\ubcf5 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uc778\uc2dd \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub85c, \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc911\uac04 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uce90\uc2dc \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c \uc0b0\ubb3c\ub85c \uc2b9\uaca9\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc740 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc5b8\uc5b4\uc758 \ubcc0\ud654\uc640 \uc0c1\uad00\uc5c6\uc774 \uc911\ubcf5\ub41c \uc911\uac04 \ub17c\ub9ac\ub97c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc774 \uc874\uc7ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "Analytic Intent Resolution (AIR)\uacfc Visualization Synthesis (VS)\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \ubd84\ud574\ud558\uc5ec \uc911\uac04 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uce90\uc2dc\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\ub85c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ube44\uc728\uc744 83.10%\ub85c \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, 4,023\ubc88\uc758 LLM \ud638\ucd9c\uc744 \uc6b0\ud68c\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ub514\uc790\uc778\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uad50\ud6c8\uc740 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uac00 \uc790\uc8fc \ubc18\ubcf5\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub354\ub77c\ub3c4, \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc774 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc9c0\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \ud754\ud788 \ubc18\ubcf5\ub41c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc740 \uc228\uaca8\uc9c4 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \ud45c\ud604\uc774 \uc804\ud600 \uc0c8\ub86d\ub354\ub77c\ub3c4 \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \uc911\uac04 \ub17c\ub9ac, \uc608\ub97c \ub4e4\uc5b4 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad \uc815\uaddc\ud654\ub098 \ucc28\ud2b8 \uc2a4\uce90\ud3f4\ub529\uc744 \uc790\uc8fc \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uacbd\uacc4 \uce90\uc2f1\uc740 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud558\ub098\uc758 \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4\ub85c \ucde8\uae09\ud558\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc911\ubcf5 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc6b4\uc601\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uc778\uc2dd \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc778 SemanticALLI\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Structural MRI is widely available but typically relies on hand-crafted features such as cortical thickness or volume. We ask whether self-supervised learning (SSL) can uncover more powerful biomarkers from the same data. Existing SSL methods underperform FreeSurfer-derived features in disease classification, conversion prediction, and amyloid status prediction. We introduce Residual Noise Contrastive Estimation (R-NCE), a new SSL framework that integrates auxiliary FreeSurfer features while maximizing additional augmentation-invariant information.

Yet existing data science benchmarks fall short due to fragmented evaluation interfaces that make cross-benchmark comparison difficult, narrow task coverage and a lack of rigorous data grounding. In particular, we show that a substantial portion of tasks in current benchmarks can be solved without using the actual data. To address these limitations, we introduce DSGym, a standardized framework for evaluating and training data science agents in self-contained execution environments. Unlike static benchmarks, DSGym provides a modular architecture that makes it easy to add tasks, agent scaffolds, and tools, positioning it as a live, extensible testbed. We curate DSGym-Tasks, a holistic task suite that standardizes and refines existing benchmarks via quality and shortcut solvability filtering. We further expand coverage with (1) DSBio: expert-derived bioinformatics tasks grounded in literature and (2) DSPredict: challenging prediction tasks spanning domains such as computer vision, molecular prediction, and single-cell perturbation. Beyond evaluation, DSGym enables agent training via execution-verified data synthesis pipeline. As a case study, we build a 2,000-example training set and trained a 4B model in DSGym that outperforms GPT-4o on standardized analysis benchmarks. Overall, DSGym enables rigorous end-to-end measurement of whether agents can plan, implement, and validate data analyses in realistic scientific context.", "AI": {"tldr": "DSGym\uc740

Unlike traditional Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) which rely on static gating networks, NSED employs a Dynamic Expertise Broker - a runtime optimization engine that treats model selection as a variation of the Knapsack Problem, binding heterogeneous checkpoints to functional roles based on live telemetry and cost constraints. At the execution layer, we formalize deliberation as a Macro-Scale Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), where the consensus state loops back through a semantic forget gate to enable iterative refinement without proportional VRAM scaling. Key components include an orchestration fabric for trustless N-to-N peer review, a Quadratic Voting activation function for non-linear consensus, and a feedback-driven state update. Empirical validation on challenging benchmarks (AIME 2025, LiveCodeBench) demonstrates that this topology allows ensembles of small (less than 20B) consumer-grade models to match or exceed the performance of state-of-the-art 100B+ parameter models, establishing a new hardware arbitrage efficiency frontier.

With the rise of large language models (LLMs), textual attributes in FGL graphs are gaining attention. Text-attributed graph federated learning (TAG-FGL) improves FGL by explicitly leveraging LLMs to process and integrate these textual features. However, current TAG-FGL methods face three main challenges: \\textbf{(1) Overhead.} LLMs for processing long texts incur high token and computation costs. To make TAG-FGL practical, we introduce graph condensation (GC) to reduce computation load, but this choice also brings new issues. \\textbf{(2) Suboptimal.} To reduce LLM overhead, we introduce GC into TAG-FGL by compressing multi-hop texts/neighborhoods into a condensed core with fixed LLM surrogates. However, this one-shot condensation is often not client-adaptive, leading to suboptimal performance. \\textbf{(3) Interpretability.} LLM-based condensation further introduces a black-box bottleneck: summaries lack faithful attribution and clear grounding to specific source spans, making local inspection and auditing difficult. To address the above issues, we propose \\textbf{DANCE}, a new TAG-FGL paradigm with GC. To improve \\textbf{suboptimal} performance, DANCE performs round-wise, model-in-the-loop condensation refresh using the latest global model.

Although classical decision theories, such as the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), offer systematic rational frameworks, their construction relies heavily on labor-intensive domain expertise, creating an \"expert bottleneck\" that hinders scalability in general scenarios. To bridge the gap between the generalization capabilities of LLMs and the rigor of decision theory, we propose Doc2AHP, a novel structured inference framework guided by AHP principles. Eliminating the need for extensive annotated data or manual intervention, our approach leverages the structural principles of AHP as constraints to direct the LLM in a constrained search within the unstructured document space, thereby enforcing the logical entailment between parent and child nodes. Furthermore, we introduce a multi-agent weighting mechanism coupled with an adaptive consistency optimization strategy to ensure the numerical consistency of weight allocation. Empirical results demonstrate that Doc2AHP not only empowers non-expert users to construct high-quality decision models from scratch but also significantly outperforms direct generative baselines in both logical completeness and downstream task accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Doc2AHP\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ub2a5\ub825\uacfc \uacb0\uc815 \uc774\ub860\uc758 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud568 \uc0ac\uc774\uc758 \uac04\uadf9\uc744 \uba54\uc6b0\uace0, \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc758 \uac1c\uc785 \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 \uad6c\uc870\uc801\uc778 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uacb0\uc815 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uacfc \ucd94\ub860 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ud655\ubcf4\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc5b4, \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc5d0\uac8c \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc81c\uc548\ud558\ub294 Doc2AHP\ub294 AHP \uc6d0\uce59\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c LLM\uc774 \ube44\uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ubb38\uc11c \uacf5\uac04 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\uba70, \ubd80\ubaa8 \ub178\ub4dc\uc640 \uc790\uc2dd \ub178\ub4dc \uac04\uc758 \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801 \ud568\uc758\ub97c \uac15\uc81c\ud558\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc6d0\uce59\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "Doc2AHP\ub294 \ube44\uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uac00 \uace0\ud488\uc9c8\uc758 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ucc98\uc74c\ubd80\ud130 \uad6c\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uba70, \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc644\uc804\uc131 \ubc0f \ub2e4\uc6b4\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9bc \uc791\uc5c5 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4 \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c1\uc811 \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \ud574\uc18c\ud558\uace0, \ube44\uc804\ubb38\uac00\ub3c4 \uace0\uae09 \uacb0\uc815 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc27d\uac8c \uad6c\ucd95\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc774\ud574\uc5d0\uc11c \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \ub17c\ub9ac\ub97c \uc694\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uacfc \ucd94\ub860 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\ub2e4. \ubd84\uc11d\uc801 \uacc4\uce35 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4(AHP)\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uace0\uc804\uc801 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uc774\ub860\uc740 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \ud569\ub9ac\uc801 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uadf8 \uad6c\uc131\uc740 \ub178\ub3d9 \uc9d1\uc57d\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc804\ubb38 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc5d0 \ud06c\uac8c \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \uc77c\ubc18\uc801 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c '\uc804\ubb38\uac00 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1'\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud55c\ub2e4.

While recent unlearning methods attempt to mitigate this, we identify a critical flaw: structural fragility. We empirically demonstrate that standard erasure achieves only superficial suppression, trapping the model in sharp minima where hallucinations catastrophically resurge after lightweight relearning. To ensure geometric stability, we propose SARE, which casts unlearning as a targeted min-max optimization problem and uses a Targeted-SAM mechanism to explicitly flatten the loss landscape around hallucinated concepts. By suppressing hallucinations under simulated worst-case parameter perturbations, our framework ensures robust removal stable against weight shifts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SARE significantly outperforms baselines in erasure efficacy while preserving general generation quality. Crucially, it maintains persistent hallucination suppression against relearning and parameter updates, validating the effectiveness of geometric stabilization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub2e4\uc911\ubaa8\ub2ec LLM\uc740 \uac15\ub825\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uac1d\uccb4 \ud658\uac01\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc5d0 \ud574\ub97c \ub07c\uce5c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 SARE\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0, \ud658\uac01\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5b5\uc81c\ud558\uba70, \uc804\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uc0dd\uc131 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uc911\ubaa8\ub2ec LLM\uc758 \uac1d\uccb4 \ud658\uac01 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0, \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "SARE\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \ube44\ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc9c0\ud5a5\uc801 \ucd5c\uc18c-\ucd5c\ub300 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\uace0, Targeted-SAM \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud658\uac01\ub41c \uac1c\ub150 \uc8fc\ubcc0\uc758 \uc190\uc2e4 \uacbd\uad00\uc744 \ud3c9\ud0c4\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "SARE\ub294 \ube44\ud559\uc2b5 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc900\uc120\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ub0b4\uba70, \uc804\uccb4 \uc0dd\uc131 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "SARE\ub294 \uc7ac\ud559\uc2b5 \ubc0f \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ud658\uac01 \uc5b5\uc81c\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uac80\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub2e4\uc911\ubaa8\ub2ec LLM\uc740 \uac15\ub825\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \uac1d\uccb4\ub97c \uc124\uba85\ud558\ub294 \ud658\uac01\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc5d0 \ud574\ub97c \ub07c\uce5c\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc\uc758 \ube44\ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc774 \uc774\ub97c \uc644\ud654\ud558\ub824\uace0 \uc2dc\ub3c4\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \uacb0\ud568\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud45c\uc900 \uc81c\uac70\uac00 \ub2e8\uc9c0 \ud53c\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \uc5b5\uc81c\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud560 \ubfd0\uc774\uba70, \uacbd\ub7c9 \uc7ac\ud559\uc2b5 \ud6c4 \ud658\uac01\uc774 \uc7ac\ubc1c\ud558\ub294 \ub0a0\uce74\ub85c\uc6b4 \ucd5c\uc18c\uac12\uc5d0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uac00\ub450\ub294 \uc0c1\ud669\uc744 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ube44\ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc9c0\ud5a5\uc801\uc778 \ucd5c\uc18c-\ucd5c\ub300 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \ud45c\ud604\ud558\uace0, Targeted-SAM \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud658\uac01\ub41c \uac1c\ub150 \uc8fc\ubcc0\uc758 \uc190\uc2e4 \uacbd\uad00\uc744 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\ud0c4\ud654\ud558\ub294 SARE\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ub41c \ucd5c\uc545\uc758 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \ubcc0\ub3d9 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \ud658\uac01\uc744 \uc5b5\uc81c\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368, \uc6b0\ub9ac \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uac00\uc911\uce58 \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc81c\uac70\ub97c \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4. \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc SARE\ub294 \ube44\ud559\uc2b5 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\uace0 \uc804\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uc0dd\uc131 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788, \uc774\ub294 \uc7ac\ud559\uc2b5 \ubc0f \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ud658\uac01 \uc5b5\uc81c\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \uc548\uc815\ud654\uc758 \uc720\ud6a8\uc131\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

We introduce SycoEval-EM, a multi-agent simulation framework evaluating LLM robustness through adversarial patient persuasion in emergency medicine. Across 20 LLMs and 1,875 encounters spanning three Choosing Wisely scenarios, acquiescence rates ranged from 0-100\\%. Models showed higher vulnerability to imaging requests (38.8\\%) than opioid prescriptions (25.0\\%), with model capability poorly predicting robustness. All persuasion tactics proved equally effective (30.0-36.0\\%), indicating general susceptibility rather than tactic-specific weakness.

Accurate causal models provide a means to enhance the interpretability of predictive models, and furthermore a basis for counterfactual and interventional reasoning and the estimation of treatment effects. However, would-be practitioners of causal discovery face a dizzying array of algorithms without a clear best choice. This abundance of competitive algorithms makes ensembling a natural choice for practical applications. At the same time, real-world use cases frequently face challenges that violate the assumptions of common causal discovery algorithms, forcing heavy reliance on expert knowledge. Inspired by recent work on dynamically requested expert knowledge and LLMs as experts, we present a flexible model averaging method leveraging dynamically requested expert knowledge to ensemble a diverse array of causal discovery algorithms. Experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our method with imperfect experts such as LLMs on both clean and noisy data. We also analyze the impact of different degrees of expert correctness and assess the capabilities of LLMs for clinical causal discovery, providing valuable insights for practitioners.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc778\uacfc \ubc1c\uacac \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc559\uc0c1\ube14\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc694\uccad\ub418\ub294 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc720\uc5f0\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378 \ud3c9\uade0\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc784\uc0c1 \uc778\uacfc \ubc1c\uacac\uc5d0\uc11c LLM\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ubd88\uc644\uc804\ud55c \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc640 \ud568\uaed8 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc784\uc744 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc778\uacfc \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uc774\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc758\ub8cc \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc911\uc694\ud558\uba70, \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc778\uacfc \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc608\uce21 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud574\uc11d\ub825\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uace0 \ubc18\uc0ac\uc2e4\uc801 \ubc0f \uac1c\uc785\uc801 \ucd94\ub860, \uce58\ub8cc \ud6a8\uacfc \ucd94\uc815\uc758 \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc694\uccad\ub418\ub294 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc778\uacfc \ubc1c\uacac \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc559\uc0c1\ube14\ud558\ub294 \uc720\uc5f0\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378 \ud3c9\uade0\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 LLM\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ubd88\uc644\uc804\ud55c \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc640 \ud568\uaed8 \uccad\uacb0\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \ub178\uc774\uc988\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ud6a8\ub2a5\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131 \uc815\ub3c4\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0, \uc784\uc0c1 \uc778\uacfc \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \uc704\ud55c LLM\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\ubb34\uc790\uc5d0\uac8c \uadc0\uc911\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc778\uacfc \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uc774\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc758\ub8cc\uc5d0 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc778\uacfc \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc608\uce21 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud574\uc11d\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc218\ub2e8\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \ubc18\uc0ac\uc2e4\uc801 \ubc0f \uac1c\uc785\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uacfc \uce58\ub8cc \ud6a8\uacfc \ucd94\uc815\uc758 \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc778\uacfc \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \uc2dc\ub3c4\ud558\ub294 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc790\ub4e4\uc740 \uba85\ud655\ud55c \ucd5c\uc120\uc758 \uc120\ud0dd\uc774 \uc5c6\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacbd\uc7c1 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc774 \ub9ce\uc544\uc9d0\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc559\uc0c1\ube14 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uc751\uc6a9\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7ec\uc6b4 \uc120\ud0dd\uc774 \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uc0ac\ub840\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uc778\uacfc \ubc1c\uacac \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \uac00\uc815\uc744 \uc704\ubc18\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc790\uc8fc \uc9c1\uba74\ud558\uc5ec \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc5d0 \ud06c\uac8c \uc758\uc874\ud558\uac8c \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc\uc758 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc694\uccad\ub41c \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc9c0\uc2dd \ubc0f LLM\uc744 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0 \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc544, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc778\uacfc \ubc1c\uacac \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc559\uc0c1\ube14\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc694\uccad\ub418\ub294 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc720\uc5f0\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378 \ud3c9\uade0\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 LLM\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ubd88\uc644\uc804\ud55c \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc640 \ud568\uaed8 \uccad\uacb0\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \ub178\uc774\uc988\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ud6a8\ub2a5\uc774 \uc785\uc99d\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131 \uc815\ub3c4\uc758 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0 \uc784\uc0c1 \uc778\uacfc \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \uc704\ud55c LLM\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\ubb34\uc790\uc5d0\uac8c \uadc0\uc911\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

In this work, we aim to better understand the relative importance of advancing these underlying capabilities for success on such tasks. We develop an oracle counterfactual framework for multi-turn problems that asks: how would an agent perform if it could leverage an oracle to perfectly perform a specific task? The change in the agent's performance due to this oracle assistance allows us to measure the criticality of such oracle skill in the future advancement of AI agents. We introduce a suite of procedurally generated, game-like tasks with tunable complexity. These controlled environments allow us to provide precise oracle interventions, such as perfect planning or flawless state tracking, and make it possible to isolate the contribution of each oracle without confounding effects present in real-world benchmarks. Our results show that while some interventions (e.g., planning) consistently improve performance across settings, the usefulness of other skills is dependent on the properties of the environment and language model.

In this work, we present the Auto-Regressive Masked Diffusion (ARMD) model, an architecture designed to close this gap by unifying the training efficiency of autoregressive models with the parallel generation capabilities of diffusion-based models. Our key insight is to reframe the masked diffusion process as a block-wise causal model. This perspective allows us to design a strictly causal, permutation-equivariant architecture that computes all conditional probabilities across multiple denoising steps in a single, parallel forward pass. The resulting architecture supports efficient, autoregressive-style decoding and a progressive permutation training scheme, allowing the model to learn both canonical left-to-right and random token orderings. Leveraging this flexibility, we introduce a novel strided parallel generation strategy that accelerates inference by generating tokens in parallel streams while maintaining global coherence. Empirical results demonstrate that ARMD achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard language modeling benchmarks, outperforming established diffusion baselines while requiring significantly fewer training steps. Furthermore, it establishes a new benchmark for parallel text generation, effectively bridging the performance gap between parallel and sequential decoding.", "AI": {"tldr": "ARMD \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc790\uac00 \ud68c\uadc0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud655\ub9bd \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ubcd1\ub82c \uc0dd\uc131 \ub2a5\ub825\uacfc \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc131\ub2a5 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \uc904\uc778\ub2e4.", "motivation": "MDM\uc740 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c \ubd80\uc0c1\ud588\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc790\uac00 \ud68c\uadc0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc131\ub2a5 \ucc28\uc774\uc640 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc740 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "ARMD \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud06c\ub41c \ud655\uc0b0 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \ube14\ub85d-\uae30\ubc18 \uc778\uacfc \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc870\uac74\ubd80 \ud655\ub960\uc744 \ub2e8\uc77c \ubcd1\ub82c \uc804\ubc29 \ud1b5\uacfc\uc5d0\uc11c \uacc4\uc0b0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "ARMD\ub294 \ud45c\uc900 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud655\uc0b0 \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud6e8\uc52c \uc801\uc740 \ud559\uc2b5 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub85c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "ARMD\ub294 \ubcd1\ub82c\uacfc \uc21c\ucc28 \ub514\ucf54\ub529 \uac04\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc904\uc774\uba70, \ubcd1\ub82c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \uc124\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub9c8\uc2a4\ud06c\ub4dc \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378(MDM)\uc740 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \ub5a0\uc62c\ub790\uc73c\ub098, \uc790\uae30 \ud68c\uadc0 \ubaa8\ub378(ARM)\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc131\ub2a5 \uaca9\ucc28\uc640 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc740 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uc18c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc790\uac00 \ud68c\uadc0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud6c8\ub828 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \ud655\uc0b0 \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ubcd1\ub82c \uc0dd\uc131 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c Auto-Regressive Masked Diffusion(ARMD) \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc740 \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud06c\ub41c \ud655\uc0b0 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \ube14\ub85d \uae30\ubc18 \uc778\uacfc \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub514\ub178\uc774\uc9d5 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc870\uac74\ubd80 \ud655\ub960\uc744 \ub2e8\uc77c \ubcd1\ub82c \uc804\ubc29 \ud1b5\uacfc\ub85c \uacc4\uc0b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \uc778\uacfc \uad00\uacc4\uc758 \uc21c\uc5f4 \ubd88\ubcc0 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uc124\uacc4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774 \uacb0\uacfc \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub294 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc790\uac00 \ud68c\uadc0 \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c\uc758 \ub514\ucf54\ub529\uacfc \uc810\uc9c4\uc801\uc778 \uc21c\uc5f4 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc804\ud615\uc801\uc778 \uc67c\ucabd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc624\ub978\ucabd \ubc29\ud5a5\uacfc \uc784\uc758\uc758 \ud1a0\ud070 \uc21c\uc11c \ubaa8\ub450\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc720\uc5f0\uc131\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc804\uc5ed \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ubcd1\ub82c \uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9bc\uc5d0\uc11c \ud1a0\ud070\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubcf4\ud3ed \ubcd1\ub82c \uc0dd\uc131 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4. \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 ARMD\uac00 \ud45c\uc900 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, \ud655\ub9bd\ub41c \ud655\uc0b0 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\uace0 \ud6e8\uc52c \uc801\uc740 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub85c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc774\ub294 \ubcd1\ub82c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc0dd\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \uc124\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \ubcd1\ub82c \ubc0f \uc21c\ucc28 \ub514\ucf54\ub529 \uac04\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uc18c\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

Existing evaluation methods often fail to capture the structured diagnostic logic that underlies radiological interpretation, resulting in unreliable judgments and limited clinical relevance. We introduce AgentsEval, a multi-agent stream reasoning framework that emulates the collaborative diagnostic workflow of radiologists. By dividing the evaluation process into interpretable steps including criteria definition, evidence extraction, alignment, and consistency scoring, AgentsEval provides explicit reasoning traces and structured clinical feedback. We also construct a multi-domain perturbation-based benchmark covering five medical report datasets with diverse imaging modalities and controlled semantic variations. Experimental results demonstrate that AgentsEval delivers clinically aligned, semantically faithful, and interpretable evaluations that remain robust under paraphrastic, semantic, and stylistic perturbations.

LongCat-Flash-Thinking-2601 achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models on a wide range of agentic benchmarks, including agentic search, agentic tool use, and tool-integrated reasoning. Beyond benchmark performance, the model demonstrates strong generalization to complex tool interactions and robust behavior under noisy real-world environments. Its advanced capability stems from a unified training framework that combines domain-parallel expert training with subsequent fusion, together with an end-to-end co-design of data construction, environments, algorithms, and infrastructure spanning from pre-training to post-training. In particular, the model's strong generalization capability in complex tool-use are driven by our in-depth exploration of environment scaling and principled task construction. To optimize long-tailed, skewed generation and multi-turn agentic interactions, and to enable stable training across over 10,000 environments spanning more than 20 domains, we systematically extend our asynchronous reinforcement learning framework, DORA, for stable and efficient large-scale multi-environment training.

A key challenge is how to better represent the relationships among students, questions, and knowledge concepts (KCs). Recently, graph-based KT paradigms have shown promise for this problem. However, existing methods have not sufficiently explored inter-concept relations, often inferred solely from interaction sequences. In addition, the scale and heterogeneity of KT graphs make full-graph encoding both computationally both costly and noise-prone, causing attention to bleed into student-irrelevant regions and degrading the fidelity of inter-KC relations. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework: Multi-Agent Graph-Enhanced Knowledge Tracing (MAGE-KT). It constructs a multi-view heterogeneous graph by combining a multi-agent KC relation extractor and a student-question interaction graph, capturing complementary semantic and behavioral signals. Conditioned on the target student's history, it retrieves compact, high-value subgraphs and integrates them using an Asymmetric Cross-attention Fusion Module to enhance prediction while avoiding attention diffusion and irrelevant computation. Experiments on three widely used KT datasets show substantial improvements in KC-relation accuracy and clear gains in next-question prediction over existing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8

However, evaluating and training such agentic AI models remains challenging due to the lack of large-scale, structured, and safety-critical benchmarks. This paper introduces AgentDrive, an open benchmark dataset containing 300,000 LLM-generated driving scenarios designed for training, fine-tuning, and evaluating autonomous agents under diverse conditions. AgentDrive formalizes a factorized scenario space across seven orthogonal axes: scenario type, driver behavior, environment, road layout, objective, difficulty, and traffic density. An LLM-driven prompt-to-JSON pipeline generates semantically rich, simulation-ready specifications that are validated against physical and schema constraints. Each scenario undergoes simulation rollouts, surrogate safety metric computation, and rule-based outcome labeling. To complement simulation-based evaluation, we introduce AgentDrive-MCQ, a 100,000-question multiple-choice benchmark spanning five reasoning dimensions: physics, policy, hybrid, scenario, and comparative reasoning. We conduct a large-scale evaluation of fifty leading LLMs on AgentDrive-MCQ. Results show that while proprietary frontier models perform best in contextual and policy reasoning, advanced open models are rapidly closing the gap in structured and physics-grounded reasoning.

However, existing LLM-based agents often fail at genuine geospatial computation, relying instead on web search or pattern matching while hallucinating spatial relationships. We present Spatial-Agent, an AI agent grounded in foundational theories of spatial information science. Our approach formalizes geo-analytical question answering as a concept transformation problem, where natural-language questions are parsed into executable workflows represented as GeoFlow Graphs -- directed acyclic graphs with nodes corresponding to spatial concepts and edges representing transformations. Drawing on spatial information theory, Spatial-Agent extracts spatial concepts, assigns functional roles with principled ordering constraints, and composes transformation sequences through template-based generation. Extensive experiments on MapEval-API and MapQA benchmarks demonstrate that Spatial-Agent significantly outperforms existing baselines including ReAct and Reflexion, while producing interpretable and executable geospatial workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "Spatial-Agent\ub294 \uc9c0\ub9ac\uc815\ubcf4 \uacfc\ud559\uc758 \uae30\ucd08 \uc774\ub860\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c, \uc9c4\uc815\ud55c \uc9c0\ub9ac\uc801 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\uc874 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub098\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub3c4\uc2dc \ubd84\uc11d, \uad50\ud1b5 \uacc4\ud68d \ubc0f \uc7ac\ub09c \ub300\uc751\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc778 \uc9c0\ub9ac\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870.", "method": "\uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub85c \uad6c\ubb38 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c GeoFlow Graphs\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\uc5b4 \uc9c0\ub9ac \ubd84\uc11d \uc9c8\ubb38 \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \uac1c\ub150 \ubcc0\ud658 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \ud615\uc2dd\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "Spatial-Agent\ub294 MapEval-API \ubc0f MapQA \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c ReAct \ubc0f Reflexion \ub4f1 \uae30\uc874 \uae30\uc900\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud604\uc800\ud788 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Spatial-Agent\ub294 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc9c0\ub9ac\uc801 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc9c0\ub9ac\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc740 \ub3c4\uc2dc \ubd84\uc11d, \uad50\ud1b5 \uacc4\ud68d \ubc0f \uc7ac\ub09c \ub300\uc751\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874\uc758 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc9c4\uc815\ud55c \uc9c0\ub9ac\uc801 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc5d0 \uc2e4\ud328\ud558\uace0, \ub300\uc2e0 \uc6f9 \uac80\uc0c9\uc774\ub098 \ud328\ud134 \uc77c\uce58\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uba70 \uacf5\uac04 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ud658\uac01\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uacf5\uac04 \uc815\ubcf4 \uacfc\ud559\uc758 \uae30\ucd08 \uc774\ub860\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc778 Spatial-Agent\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 GeoFlow Graphs\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b8 \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\ub294 \uc9c0\ub9ac \ubd84\uc11d \uc9c8\ubb38 \uc751\ub2f5\uc744 \uac1c\ub150 \ubcc0\ud658 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.

To appear in Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS)", "summary": "In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), a significant proportion of medical diagnostic equipment remains underutilized or non-functional due to a lack of timely maintenance, limited access to technical expertise, and minimal support from manufacturers, particularly for devices acquired through third-party vendors or donations. This challenge contributes to increased equipment downtime, delayed diagnoses, and compromised patient care. This research explores the development and validation of an AI-powered support platform designed to assist biomedical technicians in diagnosing and repairing medical devices in real-time. The system integrates a large language model (LLM) with a user-friendly web interface, enabling imaging technologists/radiographers and biomedical technicians to input error codes or device symptoms and receive accurate, step-by-step troubleshooting guidance. The platform also includes a global peer-to-peer discussion forum to support knowledge exchange and provide additional context for rare or undocumented issues. A proof of concept was developed using the Philips HDI 5000 ultrasound machine, achieving 100% precision in error code interpretation and 80% accuracy in suggesting corrective actions.

Recent deep learning models have attained very good predictive performance but their limited transparency, being black-box models, hinders their integration into clinical practice. To address this gap, we propose an intrinsically interpretable survival model called CRISPNAM-FG. Leveraging the structure of Neural Additive Models (NAMs) with separate projection vectors for each risk, our approach predicts the Cumulative Incidence Function using the Fine-Gray formulation, achieving high predictive power with intrinsically transparent and auditable predictions. We validated the model on several benchmark datasets and applied our model to predict future foot complications in diabetic patients across 29 Ontario hospitals (2016-2023). Our method achieves competitive performance compared to other deep survival models while providing transparency through shape functions and feature importance plots.", "AI": {"tldr": "CRISPNAM-FG\ub77c\ub294 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc0dd\uc874 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec, \uacbd\uc7c1 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \uc0dd\uc874 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc5d0\uc11c AI \uc548\uc804\uc131\uacfc \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub97c \ub192\uc774\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc758\ub8cc \uc751\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc740 AI \uc548\uc804\uc131\uacfc \uc784\uc0c1\uc758\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "Neural Additive Models(NAMs)\uc758 \uad6c\uc870\uc640 \uac01 \uc704\ud5d8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubcc4\ub3c4 \ud504\ub85c\uc81d\uc158 \ubca1\ud130\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec Cumulative Incidence Function\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 CRISPNAM-FG \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud588\ub2e4.", "result": "CRISPNAM-FG\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uac80\uc99d\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, 2016-2023\ub144 \ub3d9\uc548 29\uac1c \uc628\ud0c0\ub9ac\uc624 \ubcd1\uc6d0\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2f9\ub1e8\ubcd1 \ud658\uc790\uc758 \ubbf8\ub798 \ubc1c \ubcd1\ubcc0\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc801\uc6a9\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ub2e4\ub978 \ub525 \uc11c\ubc14\uc774\ubc8c \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \ud615\ud0dc \ud568\uc218\uc640 \ud2b9\uc131 \uc911\uc694\ub3c4 \ud50c\ub86f\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud22c\uba85\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubaa8\ub378 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc740 \uc0dd\uc874 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc5d0\uc11c \uacbd\uc7c1 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uc758\ub8cc \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0\uc11c AI \uc548\uc804\uc131 \ubc0f \uc784\uc0c1\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub97c \ud655\ub9bd\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc\uc758 \ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uc740 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc608\uce21 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ube14\ub799 \ubc15\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c\uc11c\uc758 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ud22c\uba85\uc131\uc740 \uc784\uc0c1 \uc2e4\uc2b5\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc7a5\uc560\ubb3c\uc774 \ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 CRISPNAM-FG\ub77c\ub294 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc0dd\uc874 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac01 \uc704\ud5d8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ubcc4\ub3c4\uc758 \ud504\ub85c\uc81d\uc158 \ubca1\ud130\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 Neural Additive Models(NAMs)\uc758 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 Fine-Gray \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec Cumulative Incidence Function\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\uba70 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud22c\uba85\ud558\uace0 \uac10\uc0ac \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc608\uce21\uc73c\ub85c \ub192\uc740 \uc608\uce21\ub825\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud588\uc73c\uba70, 2016\ub144\ubd80\ud130 2023\ub144\uae4c\uc9c0 29\uac1c\uc758 \uc628\ud0c0\ub9ac\uc624 \ubcd1\uc6d0\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2f9\ub1e8\ubcd1 \ud658\uc790\uc758 \ubbf8\ub798 \ubc1c \ud569\ubcd1\uc99d\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ub2e4\ub978 \ub525 \uc11c\ubc14\uc774\ubc8c \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \ud615\ud0dc \ud568\uc218\uc640 \ud2b9\uc131 \uc911\uc694\ub3c4 \ud50c\ub86f\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud22c\uba85\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}
