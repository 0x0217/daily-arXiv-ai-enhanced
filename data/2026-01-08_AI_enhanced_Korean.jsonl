This goal can be achieved using Explainable Reinforcement Learning (XRL) techniques. Although textual explanations are easily understood by humans, ensuring their correctness remains a challenge, and evaluations in state-of-the-art remain limited. We present a novel XRL framework for generating textual explanations, converting them into a set of transparent rules, improving their quality, and evaluating them. Expert's knowledge can be incorporated into this framework, and an automatic predicate generator is also proposed to determine the semantic information of a state. Textual explanations are generated using a Large Language Model (LLM) and a clustering technique to identify frequent conditions. These conditions are then converted into rules to evaluate their properties, fidelity, and performance in the deployed environment. Two refinement techniques are proposed to improve the quality of explanations and reduce conflicting information. Experiments were conducted in three open-source environments to enable reproducibility, and in a telecom use case to evaluate the industrial applicability of the proposed XRL framework. This framework addresses the limitations of an existing method, Autonomous Policy Explanation, and the generated transparent rules can achieve satisfactory performance on certain tasks. This framework also enables a systematic and quantitative evaluation of textual explanations, providing valuable insights for the XRL field.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc790\uc728

A common use case, for graphs with labeled nodes, seeks to find instances of a \\textit{query} graph with $q$ nodes in a (typically larger) \\textit{data} graph with $d$ nodes. The problem is NP-complete, and na\u00efve solutions are exponential in $q + d$. The fastest current heuristic has complexity $O(d^2)$. This paper outlines ASSIST (Approximate Swarming Subgraph Isomorphism through Stigmergy), inspired by the ant colony optimization approach to the traveling salesperson. After peering (identifying matching individual nodes in query and data) in time $O(q\\cdot log(d))$, the time required for ASSIST's iterative subgraph search, the combinatorially complex part of the problem, is linear in query size and constant in data size.

Existing approaches either retain full interaction histories via passive context extension, leading to substantial redundancy, or rely on iterative reasoning to filter noise, incurring high token costs. To address this challenge, we introduce SimpleMem, an efficient memory framework based on semantic lossless compression. We propose a three-stage pipeline designed to maximize information density and token utilization: (1) \\textit{Semantic Structured Compression}, which applies entropy-aware filtering to distill unstructured interactions into compact, multi-view indexed memory units; (2) \\textit{Recursive Memory Consolidation}, an asynchronous process that integrates related units into higher-level abstract representations to reduce redundancy; and (3) \\textit{Adaptive Query-Aware Retrieval}, which dynamically adjusts retrieval scope based on query complexity to construct precise context efficiently. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method consistently outperforms baseline approaches in accuracy, retrieval efficiency, and inference cost, achieving an average F1 improvement of 26.4% while reducing inference-time token consumption by up to 30-fold, demonstrating a superior balance between performance and efficiency.

Common remedies such as context compression or retrieval-augmented prompting introduce trade-offs between information fidelity and reasoning stability. We present InfiAgent, a general-purpose framework that keeps the agent's reasoning context strictly bounded regardless of task duration by externalizing persistent state into a file-centric state abstraction. At each step, the agent reconstructs context from a workspace state snapshot plus a fixed window of recent actions. Experiments on DeepResearch and an 80-paper literature review task show that, without task-specific fine-tuning, InfiAgent with a 20B open-source model is competitive with larger proprietary systems and maintains substantially higher long-horizon coverage than context-centric baselines. These results support explicit state externalization as a practical foundation for stable long-horizon agents.

For more information visit https://orchestral-ai.com", "summary": "The rapid proliferation of LLM agent frameworks has forced developers to choose between vendor lock-in through provider-specific SDKs and complex multi-package ecosystems that obscure control flow and hinder reproducibility. Integrating tool calling across multiple LLM providers remains a core engineering challenge due to fragmented APIs, incompatible message formats, and inconsistent streaming and tool-calling behavior, making it difficult to build portable, reliable agent systems. We introduce Orchestral, a lightweight Python framework that provides a unified, type-safe interface for building LLM agents across major providers while preserving the simplicity required for scientific computing and production deployment. Orchestral defines a single universal representation for messages, tools, and LLM usage that operates seamlessly across providers, eliminating manual format translation and reducing framework-induced complexity. Automatic tool schema generation from Python type hints removes the need for handwritten descriptors while maintaining type safety across provider boundaries. A synchronous execution model with streaming support enables deterministic behavior, straightforward debugging, and real-time interaction without introducing server dependencies. The framework's modular architecture cleanly separates provider integration, tool execution, conversation orchestration, and user-facing interfaces, enabling extensibility without architectural entanglement. Orchestral supports advanced agent capabilities found in larger frameworks, including rich tool calling, context compaction, workspace sandboxing, user approval workflows, sub-agents, memory management, and MCP integration.", "AI": {"tldr": "Orchestral\uc740 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uacbd\ub7c9 Python \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc8fc\uc694 \uc81c\uacf5\uc5c5\uccb4 \uac04\uc758 \ud1b5\ud569 \ubc0f \ub2e8\uc21c\uc131 \uc720\uc9c0\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \uae09\uc18d\ud55c \ud655\uc0b0\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc790\ub4e4\uc740 \uacf5\uae09\uc5c5\uccb4 \ud2b9\uc815 SDK\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \uc7a0\uae08 \ub610\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \ud328\ud0a4\uc9c0 \uc0dd\ud0dc\uacc4 \uc0ac\uc774\uc5d0\uc11c \uc120\ud0dd\ud574\uc57c \ud588\ub2e4.", "method": "Orchestral\uc740 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc81c\uacf5\uc5c5\uccb4\ub97c \uc544\uc6b0\ub974\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569\ub41c \ud0c0\uc785 \uc548\uc804 \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\uc640 \ub2e8\uc77c \ubcf4\ud3b8\uc801 \ud45c\ud604 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc5ec API\uc758 \ub2e8\ud3b8\ud654, \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0 \ud615\uc2dd\uc758 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58 \ubc0f \ub3c4\uad6c \ud638\ucd9c \ub3d9\uc791\uc758 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "Python \ud0c0\uc785 \ud78c\ud2b8\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc790\ub3d9 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc2a4\ud0a4\ub9c8 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc218\ub3d9 \uc124\uba85\uc790\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc81c\uac70\ub418\uba70, \ub3d9\uae30 \uc2e4\ud589 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9ac\ubc0d \uc9c0\uc6d0\uc73c\ub85c \uacb0\uc815\ub860\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9\uacfc \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Orchestral\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4c8\ud615 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub85c \uc804\uccb4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \uc904\uc778\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \uae09\uc18d\ud55c \ud655\uc0b0\uc740 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc790\ub4e4\uc774 \uacf5\uae09\uc5c5\uccb4 \ud2b9\uc815 SDK\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \uacf5\uae09\uc5c5\uccb4 \uc7a0\uae08\uacfc \uc81c\uc5b4 \ud750\ub984\uc744 \ubd88\ud22c\uba85\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uace0 \uc7ac\ud604\uc131\uc744 \uc800\ud574\ud558\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \ud328\ud0a4\uc9c0 \uc0dd\ud0dc\uacc4 \uc0ac\uc774\uc5d0\uc11c \uc120\ud0dd\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uac15\uc694\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc5ec\ub7ec LLM \uacf5\uae09\uc5c5\uccb4\uc5d0\uc11c \ub3c4\uad6c \ud638\ucd9c\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ub2e8\ud3b8\ud654\ub41c API, \ud638\ud658\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0 \ud615\uc2dd \ubc0f \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9ac\ubc0d \ubc0f \ub3c4\uad6c \ud638\ucd9c \ub3d9\uc791 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \ud575\uc2ec \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\ub9c1 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ud734\ub300\uc131 \uc788\uace0 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uad6c\ucd95\uc744 \uc5b4\ub835\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4e0\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc8fc\uc694 \uacf5\uae09\uc5c5\uccb4 \uac04\uc5d0 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569\ub418\uace0 \ud0c0\uc785 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uacfc\ud559 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305 \ubc0f \uc0dd\uc0b0 \ubc30\ud3ec\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ub2e8\uc21c\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ub7c9 Python \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Orchestral\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.

Existing work often responds with \"no results\" or relaxes constraints using ad hoc rules, which can violate user intent by discarding requirements the user cares about most. We frame infeasibility handling as a preference-aware query repair problem: when a query is unsatisfiable, the agent should relax the least important constraints to the user. We propose three LLM-based methods for inferring relative constraint importance from dialogue: (1) local weighting, (2) global one-shot weighting, and (3) pairwise ranking. Experiments show local weighting achieves the best preference alignment, while global weighting performs best on correct constraint relaxation. We also introduce AWARE-US, a benchmark of persona-grounded queries requiring agents to disambiguate requests via conversation and resolve infeasibility in a way consistent with persona-implied preferences.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\ud654\ud615 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ubca0\uc774\uc2a4\ub97c \ucffc\ub9ac\ud560 \ub54c, \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0

Real websites are non-stationary and diverse, making artificial or small-scale task sets insufficient for robust policy learning. WebGym contains nearly 300,000 tasks with rubric-based evaluations across diverse, real-world websites and difficulty levels. We train agents with a simple reinforcement learning (RL) recipe, which trains on the agent's own interaction traces (rollouts), using task rewards as feedback to guide learning. To enable scaling RL, we speed up sampling of trajectories in WebGym by developing a high-throughput asynchronous rollout system, designed specifically for web agents. Our system achieves a 4-5x rollout speedup compared to naive implementations. Second, we scale the task set breadth, depth, and size, which results in continued performance improvement. Fine-tuning a strong base vision-language model, Qwen-3-VL-8B-Instruct, on WebGym results in an improvement in success rate on an out-of-distribution test set from 26.2% to 42.9%, significantly outperforming agents based on proprietary models such as GPT-4o and GPT-5-Thinking that achieve 27.1% and 29.8%, respectively. This improvement is substantial because our test set consists only of tasks on websites never seen during training, unlike many other prior works on training visual web agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "WebGym\uc740 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\uac01 \uc6f9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ucd5c\ub300 \uaddc\ubaa8\uc758 \uc624\ud508 \uc18c\uc2a4 \ud658\uacbd\uc73c\ub85c, 300,000\uac1c\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uacfc \uc2e4\uc81c \uc6f9\uc0ac\uc774\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2e4\uc81c \uc6f9\uc0ac\uc774\ud2b8\ub294 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ub2e4\uc591\ud558\uc5ec, \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5\uc774\ub098 \uc18c\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc9d1\ud569\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc815\ucc45 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uae30\ub85d\uc744 \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ub808\uc2dc\ud53c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4. \ub192\uc740 \ucc98\ub9ac\ub7c9\uc758 \ube44\ub3d9\uae30 \ub864\uc544\uc6c3 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc5ec \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \uc18d\ub3c4\ub97c \ub192\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "WebGym\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uae30\ucd08 \ube44\uc804-\uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc778 Qwen-3-VL-8B-Instruct\ub97c \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 26.2%\uc5d0\uc11c 42.9%\ub85c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf30\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc911\uc5d0 \ubcf8 \uc801\uc774 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc6f9\uc0ac\uc774\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c\ub9cc \uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc2dc\uac01 \uc6f9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828\ud55c \uae30\uc874 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub4e4\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uac1c\uc120\uc774\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\uac01 \uc6f9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ucd5c\ub300 \uaddc\ubaa8\uc758 \uc624\ud508 \uc18c\uc2a4 \ud658\uacbd\uc778 WebGym\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\uc81c \uc6f9\uc0ac\uc774\ud2b8\ub294 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ub2e4\uc591\ud558\uc5ec \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5\uc774\ub098 \uc18c\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc9d1\ud569\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc815\ucc45 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0 \ubd80\uc871\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

We introduce MultiSessionCollab, a benchmark that evaluates how well agents can learn user preferences and leverage them to improve collaboration quality throughout multiple sessions. To develop agents that succeed in this setting, we present long-term collaborative agents equipped with a memory that persists and refines user preference as interaction experience accumulates. Moreover, we demonstrate that learning signals can be derived from user simulator behavior in MultiSessionCollab to train agents to generate more comprehensive reflections and update their memory more effectively. Extensive experiments show that equipping agents with memory improves long-term collaboration, yielding higher task success rates, more efficient interactions, and reduced user effort.

However, time series anomaly detection often suffers from sparse labels, complex temporal patterns, and costly expert annotation. We propose a unified framework that integrates Large Language Model (LLM)-based potential functions for reward shaping with Reinforcement Learning (RL), Variational Autoencoder (VAE)-enhanced dynamic reward scaling, and active learning with label propagation. An LSTM-based RL agent leverages LLM-derived semantic rewards to guide exploration, while VAE reconstruction errors add unsupervised anomaly signals. Active learning selects the most uncertain samples, and label propagation efficiently expands labeled data. Evaluations on Yahoo-A1 and SMD benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art detection accuracy under limited labeling budgets and operates effectively in data-constrained settings.

Language relies on problem space search for deep semantic reasoning. While early large language models (LLMs) could generate fluent text, they lacked robust semantic reasoning capabilities. Prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) extended reasoning paths by making intermediate steps explicit. Recent models like DeepSeek-R1 enhanced performance through explicit reasoning trajectories. However, these methods have limitations in search completeness and efficiency.\n  This highlights the need for \"Time-Scaling\"--the systematic extension and optimization of an agent's ability to unfold reasoning over time. Time-Scaling refers to architectural design utilizing extended temporal pathways, enabling deeper problem space exploration, dynamic strategy adjustment, and enhanced metacognitive control, paralleling human sequential reasoning under cognitive constraints. It represents a critical frontier for enhancing deep reasoning and problem-solving without proportional increases in static model parameters. Advancing intelligent agent capabilities requires placing Time-Scaling principles at the forefront, positioning explicit temporal reasoning management as foundational.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc758 \uc218\ub834\uacfc \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2dc\uac04 \ud655\uc7a5(Time-Scaling)\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc778\uc9c0 \uc790\uc6d0\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0, \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5\uc758 \uae4a\uc740 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc2dc\uac04 \ud655\uc7a5(Time-Scaling)\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \ub514\uc790\uc778\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud3bc\uce58\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uace0 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "DeepSeek-R1\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ucd5c\uadfc \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uc774 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \uada4\uc801\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uac80\uc0c9 \uc644\uc804\uc131\uacfc \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\ud55c\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uae4a\uc740 \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub824\uba74 \uc2dc\uac04 \ud655\uc7a5 \uc6d0\ub9ac\ub97c \ucd5c\uc6b0\uc120\uc73c\ub85c \ub450\uc5b4\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd08\uae30\uc758 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc740 \ubd84\ub9ac\ub41c \uc778\uc9c0 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\ub2e4: \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc740 \"\uc9c0\uac01-\ud45c\uc0c1\"\uc5d0, \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \"\uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815-\ud589\ub3d9\"\uc5d0, \uae30\ud638 AI\ub294 \"\uc9c0\uc2dd-\ucd94\ub860\"\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\ud588\ub2e4. \ubcc0\ud658\uae30 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ub300\ud615 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc740 \ud3d0\uc1c4 \ub8e8\ud504 \"\uc9c0\uac01-\uacb0\uc815-\ud589\ub3d9\" \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \uc778\uc9c0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \uc218\ub834\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc778\uac04\uc740 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc778\uc9c0 \uc790\uc6d0 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\uac04\ud654\ub41c \uc21c\ucc28\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc5b8\uc5b4\ub294 \uae4a\uc740 \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c \uacf5\uac04 \uac80\uc0c9\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud55c\ub2e4. \ucd08\uae30 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \uc720\ucc3d\ud55c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uacac\uace0\ud55c \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud588\ub2e4.

We first observe that the model's NCMI is inversely proportional to its accuracy. Building on this insight, we introduce an alternating algorithm to efficiently minimize the NCMI. Across image recognition and whole-slide imaging (WSI) subtyping benchmarks, NCMI-trained models surpass state of the art losses by substantial margins at a computational cost comparable to that of CE. Notably, on ImageNet, NCMI yields a 2.77% top-1 accuracy improvement with ResNet-50 comparing to the CE; on CAMELYON-17, replacing CE with NCMI improves the macro-F1 by 8.6% over the strongest baseline.

This chapter examines the emergence of agentic AI systems that integrate planning, memory, tool use, and iterative reasoning to operate autonomously in complex environments. We trace the architectural progression from statistical models to transformer-based systems, identifying capabilities that enable agentic behavior: long-range reasoning, contextual awareness, and adaptive decision-making. The chapter provides three contributions: (1) a synthesis of how LLM capabilities extend toward agency through reasoning-action-reflection loops; (2) an integrative framework describing core components perception, memory, planning, and tool execution that bridge LLMs with autonomous behavior; (3) a critical assessment of applications and persistent challenges in safety, alignment, reliability, and sustainability. Unlike existing surveys, we focus on the architectural transition from language understanding to autonomous action, emphasizing the technical gaps that must be resolved before deployment. We identify critical research priorities, including verifiable planning, scalable multi-agent coordination, persistent memory architectures, and governance frameworks.

Deep learning models have shown high predictive accuracy; however, they are often criticized for lacking well, calibrated uncertainty estimates without which these models are hardly deployable in a clinical setting. To this end, we present the Conformal Bayesian Dermatological Classifier (CBDC), a well, founded framework that combines Statistical Learning Theory, Topological Data Analysis (TDA), and Bayesian Conformal Inference. CBDC offers distribution, dependent generalization bounds that reflect dermatological variability, proves a topological stability theorem that guarantees the invariance of convolutional neural network embeddings under photometric and morphological perturbations and provides finite conformal coverage guarantees for trustworthy uncertainty quantification.\n  Through exhaustive experiments on the HAM10000, PH2, and ISIC 2020 datasets, we show that CBDC not only attains classification accuracy but also generates calibrated predictions that are interpretable from a clinical perspective.

This paper presents a general agent framework, integrating Large Language Models (LLM) with vision foundation models to form ChangeGPT. A hierarchical structure is employed to mitigate hallucination. The agent was evaluated on a curated dataset of 140 questions categorized by real-world scenarios, encompassing various question types (e.g., Size, Class, Number) and complexities. The evaluation assessed the agent's tool selection ability (Precision/Recall) and overall query accuracy (Match). ChangeGPT, especially with a GPT-4-turbo backend, demonstrated superior performance, achieving a 90.71 % Match rate.

This paper introduces LendNova, the first practical automated end-to-end pipeline for credit risk assessment, designed to utilize all available information in raw credit records by leveraging advanced NLP techniques and language models. LendNova transforms risk modeling by operating directly on raw, jargon-heavy credit bureau text using a language model that learns task-relevant representations without manual feature engineering. By automatically capturing patterns and risk signals embedded in the text, it replaces manual preprocessing steps, reducing costs and improving scalability. Evaluation on real-world data further demonstrates its strong potential in accurate and efficient risk assessment. LendNova establishes a baseline for intelligent credit risk agents, demonstrating the feasibility of language models in this domain. It lays the groundwork for future research toward foundation systems that enable more accurate, adaptable, and automated financial decision-making.", "AI": {"tldr": "LendNova\ub294 \uc2e0\uc6a9 \uc704\ud5d8 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uc5d4\ub4dc \ud22c \uc5d4\ub4dc \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc73c\ub85c, \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc218\uc791\uc5c5 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc6d0\uc2dc \uc2e0\uc6a9 \uae30\ub85d\uc758 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2e0\uc6a9 \uc704\ud5d8 \ud3c9\uac00\ub294 \uae08\uc735 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uace0\ube44\uc6a9\uc758 \ud2b9\uc9d5 \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud574\uc654\ub2e4.", "method": "LendNova\ub294 \uace0\uae09 NLP \uae30\uc220\uacfc \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc6d0\uc2dc \uc2e0\uc6a9 \uae30\ub85d\uc758 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ud655\ud558\uace0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc704\ud5d8 \ud3c9\uac00\uc758 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubbf8\ub798\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \ub9c8\ub828\ud558\uace0, \ub354 \uc815\ud655\ud558\uace0 \uc720\uc5f0\ud558\uba70 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uae08\uc735 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uae30\ucd08 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud1a0\ub300\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc2e0\uc6a9 \uc704\ud5d8 \ud3c9\uac00\ub294 \uae08\uc735 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uace0\ube44\uc6a9\uc758 \ud2b9\uc9d5 \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud574 \uc654\uc73c\uba70, \uc885\uc885 \uc6d0\uc2dc \uc2e0\uc6a9 \uae30\ub85d\uc758 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uac00\uc6a9 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uace0\uae09 NLP \uae30\uc220\uacfc \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc6d0\uc2dc \uc2e0\uc6a9 \uae30\ub85d\uc758 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc2e0\uc6a9 \uc704\ud5d8 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \uc2e4\uc6a9 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uc5d4\ub4dc \ud22c \uc5d4\ub4dc \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc778 LendNova\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Current AI approaches suffer from hallucinations in systematic review tasks, with studies reporting rates ranging from 28--40% for earlier models to 2--15% for modern implementations which is unacceptable when errors impact patient care.\n  We present a causal graph-enhanced retrieval-augmented generation system integrating explicit causal reasoning with dual-level knowledge graphs. Our approach enforces evidence-first protocols where every causal claim traces to retrieved literature and automatically generates directed acyclic graphs visualizing intervention-outcome pathways.\n  Evaluation on 234 dementia exercise abstracts shows CausalAgent achieves 95% accuracy, 100% retrieval success, and zero hallucinations versus 34% accuracy and 10% hallucinations for baseline AI. Automatic causal graphs enable explicit mechanism modeling, visual synthesis, and enhanced interpretability. While this proof-of-concept evaluation used ten questions focused on dementia exercise research, the architectural approach demonstrates transferable principles for trustworthy medical AI and causal reasoning's potential for high-stakes healthcare.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \ubb38\ud5cc \uac80\ud1a0\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf1c, \ud658\uc790 \uce58\ub8cc\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ud655\ubcf4\ud568.", "motivation": "1.5\ubc31\ub9cc \uac1c \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uc5f0\uac04 \ucd9c\ud310\ubb3c\uc744 \uc218\uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\ud1a0\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ubd88\uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uba70, \ud604\uc7ac AI \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801 \uac80\ud1a0 \uc5c5\ubb34\uc5d0\uc11c \ud658\uac01 \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uba85\uc2dc\uc801 \uc778\uacfc \ucd94\ub860\uacfc \uc774\uc911 \uc218\uc900 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \uc778\uacfc \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ud5a5\uc0c1 \uac80\uc0c9 \ubcf4\uac15 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "CausalAgent\ub294 95% \uc815\ud655\ub3c4, 100% \uac80\uc0c9 \uc131\uacf5\ub960, 0% \ud658\uac01\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc758\ub8cc AI\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc804\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc6d0\uce59\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \ub9ac\ubdf0\ub294 \uadfc\uac70 \uae30\ubc18 \uc758\ud559\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub9e4\ub144 150\ub9cc \uac1c \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \ucd9c\ud310\ubb3c\uc744 \uc218\uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\ud1a0\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ubd88\uac00\ub2a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud604\uc7ac AI \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ub9ac\ubdf0 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud658\uac01 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ucd08\uae30 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c 28--40%, \ud604\ub300 \uad6c\ud604\uc5d0\uc11c 2--15%\uc758 \ube44\uc728\ub85c \uc624\ub958\uac00 \ud658\uc790 \uce58\ub8cc\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ubc1b\uc544\ub4e4\uc77c \uc218 \uc5c6\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801 \uc778\uacfc \ucd94\ub860\uacfc \uc774\uc911 \uc218\uc900 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \uc778\uacfc \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uac15\ud654 \uac80\uc0c9 \ubcf4\uac15 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc778\uacfc \uc8fc\uc7a5\uc774 \uac80\uc0c9\ub41c \ubb38\ud5cc\uc5d0 \uc5f0\uacb0\ub418\ub294 \uc99d\uac70 \uc6b0\uc120 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uac1c\uc785-\uacb0\uacfc \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc2dc\uac01\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc131 \ube44\uc21c\ud658 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. 234\uac1c\uc758 \uce58\ub9e4 \uc6b4\ub3d9 \ucd08\ub85d\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud3c9\uac00 \uacb0\uacfc, CausalAgent\ub294 95%\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4, 100%\uc758 \uac80\uc0c9 \uc131\uacf5\ub960 \ubc0f 0%\uc758 \ud658\uac01\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\uace0, \uae30\uc900\uc120 AI\ub294 34%\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc640 10%\uc758 \ud658\uac01\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc790\ub3d9 \uc778\uacfc \uadf8\ub798\ub294 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1, \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \ud569\uc131\uacfc \uac15\ud654\ub41c \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uac1c\ub150 \uc99d\uba85 \ud3c9\uac00\ub294 \uce58\ub9e4 \uc6b4\ub3d9 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\ud55c 10\uac00\uc9c0 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud588\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774 \uac74\ucd95\uc801 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc758\ub8cc AI\uc640 \uc778\uacfc \ucd94\ub860\uc774 \uace0\uc704\ud5d8 \uc758\ub8cc\uc5d0\uc11c \ud070 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

GPFs first introduce some prompt atoms and then learns the optimal prompt vector for each graph node using the linear combination of prompt atoms. However, existing GPFs generally conduct prompting over node's all feature dimensions which is obviously redundant and also be sensitive to node feature noise. To overcome this issue, for the first time, this paper proposes learning sparse graph prompts by leveraging the spiking neuron mechanism, termed Spiking Graph Prompt Feature (SpikingGPF). Our approach is motivated by the observation that spiking neuron can perform inexpensive information processing and produce sparse outputs which naturally fits the task of our graph sparse prompting. Specifically, SpikingGPF has two main aspects. First, it learns a sparse prompt vector for each node by exploiting a spiking neuron architecture, enabling prompting on selective node features. This yields a more compact and lightweight prompting design while also improving robustness against node noise. Second, SpikingGPF introduces a novel prompt representation learning model based on sparse representation theory, i.e., it represents each node prompt as a sparse combination of prompt atoms. This encourages a more compact representation and also facilitates efficient computation. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of SpikingGPF.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud76c\uc18c \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8(feature) \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec, \uc2e0\uacbd \uc138\ud3ec \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud574 \uc608\uce21 \ub178\ub4dc\uc758 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \uc120\ud0dd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud504\ub85c\ubaa8\ud305\ud558\uc5ec \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8ec\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2a4\ud30c\uc774\ud06c \ub274\ub7f0\uc774 \uc800\ub834\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4 \ucc98\ub9ac\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud558\uace0 \ud76c\uc18c \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uad00\ucc30\uc5d0\uc11c \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc558\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc2a4\ud30c\uc774\ud06c \ub274\ub7f0 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac01 \ub178\ub4dc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud76c\uc18c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ubca1\ud130\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uace0, \ud76c\uc18c \ud45c\ud604 \uc774\ub860\uc5d0 \uadfc\uac70\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc5ec\ub7ec \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 SpikingGPF\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "SpikingGPF\ub294 \ucef4\ud329\ud2b8\ud558\uace0 \uacbd\ub7c9\ud654\ub41c \ud504\ub85c\ubaa8\ud305 \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \ub178\ub4dc \ub178\uc774\uc988\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacac\uace0\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf30\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uae30\ub2a5(GPF) \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \ub2e4\uc6b4\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9bc \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c GNN \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub41c\ub2e4.

However, existing research on MAD suffers from two fundamental limitations: evaluations are conducted under fragmented and inconsistent settings, hindering fair comparison, and are largely restricted to single-modality scenarios that rely on textual inputs only. To address these gaps, we introduce M3MAD-Bench, a unified and extensible benchmark for evaluating MAD methods across Multi-domain tasks, Multi-modal inputs, and Multi-dimensional metrics. M3MAD-Bench establishes standardized protocols over five core task domains: Knowledge, Mathematics, Medicine, Natural Sciences, and Complex Reasoning, and systematically covers both pure text and vision-language datasets, enabling controlled cross-modality comparison. We evaluate MAD methods on nine base models spanning different architectures, scales, and modality capabilities. Beyond accuracy, M3MAD-Bench incorporates efficiency-oriented metrics such as token consumption and inference time, providing a holistic view of performance--cost trade-offs.

A typical example of such attacks is label poisoning, meaning that some agents possess corrupted local labels and share models trained on these poisoned data. To defend against malicious attacks, existing works often focus on designing robust aggregators; meanwhile, the weighted mean aggregator is typically considered a simple, vulnerable baseline. This paper analyzes the robustness of decentralized gradient descent under label poisoning attacks, considering both robust and weighted mean aggregators. Theoretical results reveal that the learning errors of robust aggregators depend on the network topology, whereas the performance of weighted mean aggregator is topology-independent. Remarkably, the weighted mean aggregator, although often considered vulnerable, can outperform robust aggregators under sufficient heterogeneity, particularly when: (i) the global contamination rate (i.e., the fraction of poisoned agents for the entire network) is smaller than the local contamination rate (i.e., the maximal fraction of poisoned neighbors for the regular agents); (ii) the network of regular agents is disconnected; or (iii) the network of regular agents is sparse and the local contamination rate is high.

Although supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning have proven effective for training such agents, their performance is heavily constrained by the scarcity of high-quality, goal-oriented domain-specific training data. To address this challenge, we propose SimRPD, a three-stage framework for training recruitment proactive dialogue agents. First, we develop a high-fidelity user simulator to synthesize large-scale conversational data through multi-turn online dialogue. Then we introduce a multi-dimensional evaluation framework based on Chain-of-Intention (CoI) to comprehensively assess the simulator and effectively select high-quality data, incorporating both global-level and instance-level metrics.

While LLMs have been applied to molecular simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES) in computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP), existing methodologies typically address single tasks, such as precursor prediction. We introduce ChemBART, a SMILES-based LLM pre-trained on chemical reactions, which enables a unified model for multiple downstream chemical tasks--achieving the paradigm of \"one model, one pre-training, multiple tasks.\" By leveraging outputs from a mask-filling pre-training task on reaction expressions, ChemBART effectively solves a variety of chemical problems, including precursor/reagent generation, temperature-yield regression, molecular property classification, and optimizing the policy and value functions within a reinforcement learning framework, integrated with Monte Carlo tree search for multi-step synthesis route design. Unlike single-molecule pre-trained LLMs constrained to specific applications, ChemBART addresses broader chemical challenges and integrates them for comprehensive synthesis planning. Crucially, ChemBART-designed multi-step synthesis routes and reaction conditions directly inspired wet-lab validation, which confirmed shorter pathways with ~30% yield improvement over literature benchmarks. Our work validates the power of reaction-focused pre-training and showcases the broad utility of ChemBART in advancing the complete synthesis planning cycle.", "AI": {"tldr": "ChemBART\ub294 \ud654\ud559 \ubc18\uc751\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c SMILES \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c, \uc5ec\ub7ec \ud654\ud559 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud654\ud559 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud568\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "ChemBART\ub294 \ud654\ud559 \ubc18\uc751\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c SMILES \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uba70 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub2e4\uc6b4\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9bc \ud654\ud559 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "ChemBART\ub294 \uc804\uad6c\uccb4/\uc2dc\uc57d \uc0dd\uc131, \uc628\ub3c4-\uc218\ud655\ub7c9 \ud68c\uadc0, \ubd84\uc790 \ud2b9\uc131 \ubd84\ub958 \ub4f1 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud654\ud559 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uacb0\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "ChemBART\ub294 \ud654\ud559 \ud569\uc131 \uacc4\ud68d \uc0ac\uc774\ud074\uc744 \ubc1c\uc804\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ub370 \ub113\uc740 \uc720\ud2f8\ub9ac\ud2f0\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc2e4 \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 ~30%\uc758 \uc218\ud655\ub7c9 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud601\uc2e0\uc801\uc778 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

We introduce Batch-of-Thought (BoT), a training-free method that processes related queries jointly to enable cross-instance learning. By performing comparative analysis across batches, BoT identifies high-quality reasoning templates, detects errors through consistency checks, and amortizes computational costs. We instantiate BoT within a multi-agent reflection architecture (BoT-R), where a Reflector performs joint evaluation to unlock mutual information gain unavailable in isolated processing. Experiments across three model families and six benchmarks demonstrate that BoT-R consistently improves accuracy and confidence calibration while reducing inference costs by up to 61%.

If successful, this approach offers one of the most promising routes for human oversight in AI safety. We conduct an initial stress-test of these claims by replicating their main results with open-source SAEs for Llama 3.1. While we successfully reproduce basic feature extraction and steering capabilities, our investigation suggests that major caution is warranted regarding the generalizability of these claims. We find that feature steering exhibits substantial fragility, with sensitivity to layer selection, steering magnitude, and context. We observe non-standard activation behavior and demonstrate the difficulty to distinguish thematically similar features from one another. While SAE-based interpretability produces compelling demonstrations in selected cases, current methods often fall short of the systematic reliability required for safety-critical applications. This suggests a necessary shift in focus from prioritizing interpretability of internal representations toward reliable prediction and control of model output.

Project Bluebird, an industry-academic collaboration, has developed a probabilistic Digital Twin of en route UK airspace as an environment for training and testing AI Air Traffic Control (ATC) agents. There is a developing regulatory landscape for this kind of novel technology. Regulatory requirements are expected to be application specific, and may need to be tailored to each specific use case.\n  We draw on emerging guidance for both Digital Twin development and the use of Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) in Air Traffic Management (ATM) to present an assurance framework. This framework defines actionable goals and the evidence required to demonstrate that a Digital Twin accurately represents its physical counterpart and also provides sufficient functionality across target use cases. It provides a structured approach for researchers to assess, understand and document the strengths and limitations of the Digital Twin, whilst also identifying areas where fidelity could be improved. Furthermore, it serves as a foundation for engagement with stakeholders and regulators, supporting discussions around the regulatory needs for future applications, and contributing to the emerging guidance through a concrete, working example of a Digital Twin.\n  The framework leverages a methodology known as Trustworthy and Ethical Assurance (TEA) to develop an assurance case. An assurance case is a nested set of structured arguments that provides justified evidence for how a top-level goal has been realised. In this paper we provide an overview of each structured argument and a number of deep dives which elaborate in more detail upon particular arguments, including the required evidence, assumptions and

This design limits interpretability and alignment between query intent and retrieved evidence, leading to suboptimal reasoning accuracy. In this paper, we propose MAGMA, a multi-graph agentic memory architecture that represents each memory item across orthogonal semantic, temporal, causal, and entity graphs. MAGMA formulates retrieval as policy-guided traversal over these relational views, enabling query-adaptive selection and structured context construction. By decoupling memory representation from retrieval logic, MAGMA provides transparent reasoning paths and fine-grained control over retrieval. Experiments on LoCoMo and LongMemEval demonstrate that MAGMA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art agentic memory systems in long-horizon reasoning tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "MAGMA\ub294 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ud56d\ubaa9\uc744 \uc11c\ub85c \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc5d0\uc11c \ud45c\ud604\ud558\uc5ec \uc7a5\uae30\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc99d\uac15 \uc0dd\uc131 \uae30\ubc95\uc740 \ub2e8\uc77c \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc800\uc7a5\uc18c\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uacfc \uc99d\uac70 \uac04\uc758 \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "MAGMA\ub294 \uae30\uc800 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\uc5d0 \uc811\uadfc\ud558\ub294 \uc815\ucc45 \uae30\ubc18 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\uc758 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \ub9e5\ub77d\uc744 \uad6c\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "MAGMA\ub294 LoCoMo\uc640 LongMemEval \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "MAGMA\ub294 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ud45c\ud604\uacfc \uac80\uc0c9 \ub17c\ub9ac\ub97c \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\uc5ec \ud22c\uba85\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uacbd\ub85c\uc640 \uc138\ubd80\uc801\uc778 \uac80\uc0c9 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc99d\uac15 \uc0dd\uc131(MAG)\uc740 \uc678\ubd80 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uae34 \ub9e5\ub77d \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \ub2e8\uc77c \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc800\uc7a5\uc18c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131\uc5d0 \ub9ce\uc774 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \uc2dc\uac04\uc801, \uc778\uacfc\uc801 \ubc0f \uac1c\uccb4 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc5bd\ud788\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc124\uacc4\ub294 \ucffc\ub9ac \uc758\ub3c4\uc640 \uac80\uc0c9\ub41c \uc99d\uac70 \uc0ac\uc774\uc758 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uacfc \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud558\uc5ec \ucd5c\uc801 \uc774\ud558\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc9c4\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uac01\uac01\uc758 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ud56d\ubaa9\uc744 \uc218\uc9c1\uc801 \uc758\ubbf8, \uc2dc\uac04\uc801, \uc778\uacfc\uc801 \ubc0f \uac1c\uccb4 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud45c\ud604\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc778 MAGMA\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.
