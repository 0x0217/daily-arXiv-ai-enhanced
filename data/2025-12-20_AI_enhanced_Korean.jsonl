Owing to their unique combination of efficiency, scalability, and expressive capacity, SSMs have become compelling alternatives to transformer-based models, which suffer from the quadratic computational and memory costs of attention mechanisms. As SSMs are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, it is critical to assess their susceptibility to both software- and hardware-level threats to ensure secure and reliable operation. Among such threats, hardware-induced bit-flip attacks (BFAs) pose a particularly severe risk by corrupting model parameters through memory faults, thereby undermining model accuracy and functional integrity. To investigate this vulnerability, we introduce RAMBO, the first BFA framework specifically designed to target Mamba-based architectures. Through experiments on the Mamba-1.4b model with LAMBADA benchmark, a cloze-style word-prediction task, we demonstrate that flipping merely a single critical bit can catastrophically reduce accuracy from 74.64% to 0% and increase perplexity from 18.94 to 3.75 x 10^6. These results demonstrate the pronounced fragility of SSMs to adversarial perturbations.", "AI": {"tldr": "SSM(\uc0c1\ud0dc \uacf5\uac04 \ubaa8\ub378)\uc778 Mamba \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub294 \uae34 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \uc120\ud615 \uc2dc\uac04 \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c \uc54c\ub824\uc84c\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4\uc5d0 \uc758\ud55c \ube44\ud2b8 \ud50c\ub9bd \uacf5\uaca9(BFA)\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uacfc \uae30\ub2a5\uc801 \ubb34\uacb0\uc131\uc744 \uc190\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc704\ud5d8\uc774 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 RAMBO\ub77c\ub294 \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 BFA \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "motivation": "SSM\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131, \ud655\uc7a5\uc131 \ubc0f \ud45c\ud604 \ub2a5\ub825\uc740 \ud2b8\ub79c\uc2a4\ud3ec\uba38 \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ub2e8\uc810\uc744 \ubcf4\uc644\ud558\ubbc0\ub85c, \uc774\ub97c \uc2e4\uc81c \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc5d0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \ub54c\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548\uacfc \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "Mamba-1.4b \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc LAMBADA \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 RAMBO \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc911\uc694\ud55c \ube44\ud2b8 \ud558\ub098\ub97c \ub4a4\uc9d1\uae30\ub9cc \ud574\ub3c4 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uac00 74.64%\uc5d0\uc11c 0%\ub85c \uae09\uaca9\ud788 \ud558\ub77d\ud558\uace0, \ud63c\ub780\ub3c4\uac00 18.94\uc5d0\uc11c 3.75 x 10^6\uc73c\ub85c \uc99d\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ud655\uc778\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 SSM\uc774 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uad50\ub780\uc5d0 \uadf9\ub3c4\ub85c \ucde8\uc57d\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc0c1\ud0dc \uacf5\uac04 \ubaa8\ub378(SSM), \ud2b9\ud788 Mamba \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub294 \ucd5c\uadfc \uae34 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \uc120\ud615 \uc2dc\uac04 \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c \ubd80\uc0c1\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ud6a8\uc728\uc131, \ud655\uc7a5\uc131 \ubc0f \ud45c\ud604 \ub2a5\ub825\uc758 \ub3c5\ud2b9\ud55c \uc870\ud569 \ub355\ubd84\uc5d0 SSM\uc740 \ucffc\ub4dc\ub77c\ud2f1 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ubc0f \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ube44\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \uace0\ud1b5\ubc1b\ub294 \ud2b8\ub79c\uc2a4\ud3ec\uba38 \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub9e4\ub825\uc801\uc778 \ub300\uc548\uc774 \ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.

As cyber threats grow increasingly sophisticated, NIDS must evolve to detect both emerging threats and deviations from normal behavior. This study explores the application of machine learning (ML) methods to improve the NIDS accuracy through analyzing intricate structures in deep-featured network traffic records. Leveraging the 1999 KDD CUP intrusion dataset as a benchmark, this research evaluates and optimizes several ML algorithms, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Na\u00efve Bayes variants (MNB, BNB), Random Forest (RF), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Decision Trees (DT), AdaBoost, XGBoost, Logistic Regression (LR), Ridge Classifier, Passive-Aggressive (PA) Classifier, Rocchio Classifier, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Perceptron (PPN). Initial evaluations without hyper-parameter optimization demonstrated suboptimal performance, highlighting the importance of tuning to enhance classification accuracy. After hyper-parameter optimization using grid and random search techniques, the SVM classifier achieved 99.12% accuracy with a 0.0091 False Alarm Rate (FAR), outperforming its default configuration (98.08% accuracy, 0.0123 FAR) and all other classifiers. This result confirms that SVM accomplishes the highest accuracy among the evaluated classifiers. We validated the effectiveness of all classifiers using a tenfold cross-validation approach, incorporating Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) for feature selection to enhance the classifiers accuracy and efficiency. Our outcomes indicate that ML classifiers are both adaptable and reliable, contributing to enhanced accuracy in systems for detecting network intrusions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294

Conference-style paper (IEEEtran). Proposes unified bilevel optimization framework for covert memory poisoning attacks in heterogeneous multi-agent systems (MARL + RAG)", "summary": "The increasing operational reliance on complex Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) across safety-critical domains necessitates rigorous adversarial robustness assessment. Modern MAS are inherently heterogeneous, integrating conventional Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) with emerging Large Language Model (LLM) agent architectures utilizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). A critical shared vulnerability is reliance on centralized memory components: the shared Experience Replay (ER) buffer in MARL and the external Knowledge Base (K) in RAG agents. This paper proposes XAMT (Bilevel Optimization for Covert Memory Tampering in Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Architectures), a novel framework that formalizes attack generation as a bilevel optimization problem. The Upper Level minimizes perturbation magnitude (delta) to enforce covertness while maximizing system behavior divergence toward an adversary-defined target (Lower Level). We provide rigorous mathematical instantiations for CTDE MARL algorithms and RAG-based LLM agents, demonstrating that bilevel optimization uniquely crafts stealthy, minimal-perturbation poisons evading detection heuristics. Comprehensive experimental protocols utilize SMAC and SafeRAG benchmarks to quantify effectiveness at sub-percent poison rates (less than or equal to 1 percent in MARL, less than or equal to 0.1 percent in RAG). XAMT defines a new unified class of training-time threats essential for developing intrinsically secure MAS, with implications for trust, formal verification, and defensive strategies prioritizing intrinsic safety over perimeter-based detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub3d9\uc885 \uc774\uc885 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc740\ubc00\ud55c \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ubcc0\uc870\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc774\uce35 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uacf5\uaca9 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \ud615\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\ub294 XAMT \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc548\uc804 \ud544\uc218 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(MAS)\uc758 \uc6b4\uc601 \uc758\uc874\ub3c4\uac00 \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uacac\uace0\uc131 \ud3c9\uac00\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "XAMT\ub294 \uc740\ubc00\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc801\ub300\uc790\uac00 \uc815\uc758\ud55c \ubaa9\ud45c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ud589\ub3d9\uc758 \ubc1c\uc0b0\uc744 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc12d\ub3d9 \ud06c\uae30(\ub378\ud0c0)\ub97c \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc774\uce35 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uacf5\uaca9 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \ud615\uc2dd\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "XAMT\ub294 MARL \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uacfc RAG \uae30\ubc18 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \uc218\ud559\uc801 \uc2e4\uccb4\ud654\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc5ec, \uc774\uce35 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uac00 \uac80\ucd9c \ud788\uc288\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud0a4\ub97c \ud53c\ud558\ub294 \uc740\ubc00\ud558\uace0 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud55c\uc758 \uc12d\ub3d9 \ub3c5\uc744 \ub3c5\ucc3d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub9cc\ub4e0\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "XAMT\ub294 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc548\uc804\ud55c MAS \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud6c8\ub828 \uc2dc \uc704\ud611\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud1b5\ud569 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4\ub97c \uc815\uc758\ud558\uba70, \uc2e0\ub8b0, \uacf5\uc2dd \uac80\uc99d \ubc0f \ubc29\uc5b4 \uc804\ub7b5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud568\uc758\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc548\uc804 \ud544\uc218 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(MAS)\uc758 \uc6b4\uc601 \uc758\uc874\ub3c4\uac00 \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uacac\uace0\uc131 \ud3c9\uac00\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \ud604\ub300 MAS\ub294 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\uc885\uc801\uc774\uba70, \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(MARL)\uacfc \uac80\uc0c9 \ubcf4\uac15 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc8fc\uc694 \uacf5\ub3d9 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc740 MARL\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uacf5\uc720 \uacbd\ud5d8 \uc7ac\uc0dd(ER) \ubc84\ud37c\uc640 RAG \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc678\ubd80 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uae30\ubc18(K)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc758\uc874\uc774\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774\uc885 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc5d0\uc11c \uc740\ubc00\ud55c \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ubcc0\uc870\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc774\uce35 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uacf5\uaca9 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \ud615\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\ub294 XAMT(Bilevel Optimization for Covert Memory Tampering in Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Architectures)\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc0c1\uc704 \uc218\uc900\uc740 \uc740\ubc00\ud568\uc744 \uac15\uc81c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc12d\ub3d9 \ud06c\uae30(\ub378\ud0c0)\ub97c \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\uace0, \uc801\ub300\uc790\uac00 \uc815\uc758\ud55c \ubaa9\ud45c(\ud558\uc704 \uc218\uc900)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ud589\ub3d9\uc758 \ubc1c\uc0b0\uc744 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 CTDE MARL \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uacfc RAG \uae30\ubc18 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \uc218\ud559\uc801 \uc2e4\uccb4\ud654\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0, \uc774\uce35 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uac00 \uac80\ucd9c \ud788\uc288\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud0a4\ub97c \ud53c\ud558\ub294 \uc740\ubc00\ud558\uace0 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud55c\uc758 \uc12d\ub3d9 \ub3c5\uc744 \ub3c5\ucc3d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub9cc\ub4e0\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \uc885\ud569\uc801\uc778 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc740 SMAC \ubc0f SafeRAG \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec MARL\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 1% \uc774\ud558, RAG\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 0.1% \uc774\ud558\uc758 \uc18c\ub3c5 \ub3c5 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.

During this exposure window, affected systems remain defenseless, making zero-day attacks particularly damaging and difficult to mitigate. This study analyzes the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) vulnerability disclosures reported between January and April 2024, Cole [2025] comprising a total of 415 vulnerabilities. The dataset includes vulnerability identifiers, Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) v3.0 scores, publication dates, and short textual descriptions. The primary objectives of this work are to identify trends in zero-day vulnerability disclosures, examine severity distributions across vendors, and investigate which vulnerability characteristics are most indicative of high severity. In addition, this study explores predictive modeling approaches for severity classification, comparing classical machine learning techniques with deep learning models using both structured metadata and unstructured textual descriptions. The findings aim to support improved patch prioritization strategies, more effective vulnerability management, and enhanced organizational preparedness against emerging zero-day threats.", "AI":

However, the openness and heterogeneity of LLM-based multi-agent systems also amplify the risks of deception, fraud, and misinformation, posing severe challenges to trust establishment and system robustness. To address this issue, we propose Ev-Trust, a strategy-equilibrium trust mechanism grounded in evolutionary game theory. This mechanism integrates direct trust, indirect trust, and expected revenue into a dynamic feedback structure that guides agents' behavioral evolution toward equilibria. Within a decentralized \"Request-Response-Payment-Evaluation\" service framework, Ev-Trust enables agents to adaptively adjust strategies, naturally excluding malicious participants while reinforcing high-quality collaboration. Furthermore, our theoretical derivation based on replicator dynamics equations proves the existence and stability of local evolutionary equilibria. Experimental results indicate that our approach effectively reflects agent trustworthiness in LLM-driven open service interaction scenarios, reduces malicious strategies, and increases collective revenue. We hope Ev-Trust can provide a new perspective on trust modeling for the agentic service web in group evolutionary game scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc911\uc2ec \uc6f9\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc804\ub7b5-\uade0\ud615 \uc2e0\ub8b0 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc778 Ev-Trust\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uac1c\ubc29\uc131\uacfc \uc774\uc9c8\uc131\uc774 \uc2e0\ub8b0 \uad6c\ucd95\uacfc \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uacac\uace0\uc131\uc5d0 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804\uc744 \uc81c\uae30\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "Ev-Trust\ub294 \uc9c4\ud654 \uac8c\uc784 \uc774\ub860\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uc2e0\ub8b0 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc73c\ub85c, \uc9c1\uc811 \uc2e0\ub8b0, \uac04\uc811 \uc2e0\ub8b0 \ubc0f \uae30\ub300 \uc218\uc775\uc744 \ub3d9\uc801 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \uad6c\uc870\ub85c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc9c4\ud654\ub97c \uade0\ud615\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\ub3c4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc774 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubc18\uc601\ud558\uace0 \uc545\uc758\uc801\uc778 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uba70 \uc9d1\ud569\uc801\uc778 \uc218\uc775\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Ev-Trust\uac00 \uc9d1\ub2e8 \uc9c4\ud654 \uac8c\uc784 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uc6f9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e0\ub8b0 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc5d0 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uad00\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uae30\ub97c \ud76c\ub9dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6f9\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc911\uc2ec \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \uae09\uc18d\ud55c \uc9c4\ud654\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc8fc\ub3c4\ub418\uc5b4 \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ubd84\uc0b0 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd94\ub860, \uacc4\ud68d \ubc0f \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uac1c\ubc29\uc131\uacfc \uc774\uc9c8\uc131\uc740 \ub610\ud55c \uae30\ub9cc, \uc0ac\uae30 \ubc0f \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \uc815\ubcf4\uc758 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc99d\ub300\uc2dc\ucf1c \uc2e0\ub8b0 \ud655\ub9bd \ubc0f \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uacac\uace0\uc131\uc5d0 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804\uc744 \uc81c\uae30\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc9c4\ud654 \uac8c\uc784 \uc774\ub860\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uc804\ub7b5-\uade0\ud615 \uc2e0\ub8b0 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc778 Ev-Trust\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc740 \uc9c1\uc811 \uc2e0\ub8b0, \uac04\uc811 \uc2e0\ub8b0 \ubc0f \uae30\ub300 \uc218\uc775\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc9c4\ud654\ub97c \uade0\ud615\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \uad6c\uc870\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubd84\uc0b0\ub41c '\uc694\uccad-\uc751\ub2f5-\uc9c0\ubd88-\ud3c9\uac00' \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c Ev-Trust\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc815\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \uc545\uc758\uc801\uc778 \ucc38\uc5ec\uc790\ub294 \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7fd\uac8c \ubc30\uc81c\ud558\uace0 \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \ud611\ub825\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \ubcf5\uc81c\uae30 \uc5ed\ud559 \ubc29\uc815\uc2dd\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc720\ub3c4\ub294 \uc9c0\uc5ed \uc9c4\ud654 \uade0\ud615\uc758 \uc874\uc7ac\uc640 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 LLM \uc8fc\ub3c4\uc758 \uac1c\ubc29 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubc18\uc601\ud558\uace0 \uc545\uc758\uc801\uc778 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uba70 \uc9d1\ud569\uc801\uc778 \uc218\uc775\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Ev-Trust\uac00 \uc9d1\ub2e8 \uc9c4\ud654 \uac8c\uc784 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uc6f9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e0\ub8b0 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc5d0 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uad00\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uae30\ub97c \ud76c\ub9dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, the scalability of automating their generation is severely constrained by the high cost and latency of execution-based evaluation. Existing AW performance prediction methods act as surrogates but fail to simultaneously capture the intricate topological dependencies and the deep semantic logic embedded in AWs. To address this limitation, we propose GLOW, a unified framework for AW performance prediction that combines the graph-structure modeling capabilities of GNNs with the reasoning power of LLMs. Specifically, we introduce a graph-oriented LLM, instruction-tuned on graph tasks, to extract topologically aware semantic features, which are fused with GNN-encoded structural representations. A contrastive alignment strategy further refines the latent space to distinguish high-quality AWs. Extensive experiments on FLORA-Bench show that GLOW outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in prediction accuracy and ranking utility.", "AI": {"tldr": "GLOW\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c Agentic Workflows(AWs)\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "Agentic Workflows(AWs)\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc73c\ub85c, \uc790\ub3d9 \uc0dd\uc131\uc758 \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc774 \uc2e4\ud589 \uae30\ubc18 \ud3c9\uac00\uc758 \ub192\uc740 \ube44\uc6a9\uacfc \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uc57d\ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "GLOW\ub294 GNN\uc758 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uad6c\uc870 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \ub2a5\ub825\uacfc LLM\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec AW \uc131\ub2a5 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788, \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucdb0 \ud29c\ub2dd\ub41c \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc9c0\ud5a5 LLM\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc704\uc0c1\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\uc9c0\ub41c \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c GNN \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ub41c \uad6c\uc870 \ud45c\ud604\uacfc \uc735\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "FLORA-Bench\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, GLOW\ub294 \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc640 \uc21c\uc704 \uc720\uc6a9\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc744 \ub2a5\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "GLOW\ub294 AW \uc131\ub2a5 \uc608\uce21\uc758 \uc815\ubc00\ub3c4\ub97c \ub192\uc774\uba70 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c AW\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\ubd84\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc7a0\uc7ac \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \uc815\uc81c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "Agentic Workflows(AWs)\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc73c\ub85c \ub4f1\uc7a5\ud558\uc600\uc73c\ub098, \uadf8 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\uc758 \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc740 \uc2e4\ud589 \uae30\ubc18 \ud3c9\uac00\uc758 \ub192\uc740 \ube44\uc6a9\uacfc \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc2ec\uac01\ud558\uac8c \uc81c\uc57d\ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 AW \uc131\ub2a5 \uc608\uce21 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ub300\ub9ac \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, AW\uc5d0 \ub0b4\uc7ac\ub41c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc704\uc0c1 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uacfc \uae4a\uc740 \uc758\ubbf8 \ub17c\ub9ac\ub97c \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 GLOW\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\ub294\ub370, \uc774\ub294 GNN\uc758 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uad6c\uc870 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \uae30\ub2a5\uacfc LLM\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c AW \uc131\ub2a5 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4. \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucdb0 \uc9c0\uc2dc \uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud55c \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc9c0\ud5a5 LLM\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc704\uc0c1\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\uc9c0\ub41c \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c GNN\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ub41c \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ud45c\ud604\uacfc \uc735\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub300\uc870\uc801 \uc815\ub82c \uc804\ub7b5\uc740 \uc9c8 \ub192\uc740 AW\ub97c \uad6c\ubd84\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc7a0\uc7ac \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \ub354\uc6b1 \uc815\uc81c\ud55c\ub2e4.

The system composes optical layouts by arranging components from a three-tier toolbox via semantic retrieval, then validates designs through physics simulation with convergent refinement. The architecture combines intent routing, knowledge-augmented generation, and dual-mode validation (QuTiP and FreeSim). We evaluated 13 experiments spanning fundamental optics (Hong-Ou-Mandel interference, Michelson/Mach-Zehnder interferometry, Bell states, delayed-choice quantum eraser), quantum information protocols (BB84 QKD, Franson interferometry, GHZ states, quantum teleportation, hyperentanglement), and advanced technologies (boson sampling, electromagnetically induced transparency, frequency conversion). The system achieves design-simulation alignment scores of 8--9/10, with simulations faithfully modeling intended physics. A critical finding distinguishes structural correctness from quantitative accuracy: high alignment confirms correct physics architecture, while numerical predictions require expert review. Free-form simulation outperformed constrained frameworks for 11/13 experiments, revealing that quantum optics diversity demands flexible mathematical representations. The system democratizes computational experiment design for research and pedagogy, producing strong initial designs users can iteratively refine through conversation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Anubuddhi\ub294

Trusted for their ability to act without direct oversight, such agents are increasingly considered in high-stakes domains including financial management, dispute resolution, and governance. Yet in practice, agents execute on infrastructure controlled by a host, who can tamper with models, inputs, or outputs, undermining any meaningful notion of autonomy.\n  We address this gap by introducing VET (Verifiable Execution Traces), a formal framework that achieves host-independent authentication of agent outputs and takes a step toward host-independent autonomy. Central to VET is the Agent Identity Document (AID), which specifies an agent's configuration together with the proof systems required for verification. VET is compositional: it supports multiple proof mechanisms, including trusted hardware, succinct cryptographic proofs, and notarized TLS transcripts (Web Proofs).\n  We implement VET for an API-based LLM agent and evaluate our instantiation on realistic workloads. We find that for today's black-box, secret-bearing API calls, Web Proofs appear to be the most practical choice, with overhead typically under 3$\\times$ compared to direct API calls, while for public API calls, a lower-overhead TEE Proxy is often sufficient.

Tanveer"], "title": "Twin Restricted Kernel Machines for Multiview Classification", "comment": "pp. 1-8", "summary": "Multi-view learning (MVL) is an emerging field in machine learning that focuses on improving generalization performance by leveraging complementary information from multiple perspectives or views. Various multi-view support vector machine (MvSVM) approaches have been developed, demonstrating significant success. Moreover, these models face challenges in effectively capturing decision boundaries in high-dimensional spaces using the kernel trick. They are also prone to errors and struggle with view inconsistencies, which are common in multi-view datasets. In this work, we introduce the multiview twin restricted kernel machine (TMvRKM), a novel model that integrates the strengths of kernel machines with the multiview framework, addressing key computational and generalization challenges associated with traditional kernel-based approaches. Unlike traditional methods that rely on solving large quadratic programming problems (QPPs), the proposed TMvRKM efficiently determines an optimal separating hyperplane through a regularized least squares approach, enhancing both computational efficiency and classification performance. The primal objective of TMvRKM includes a coupling term designed to balance errors across multiple views effectively. By integrating early and late fusion strategies, TMvRKM leverages the collective information from all views during training while remaining flexible to variations specific to individual views. The proposed TMvRKM model is rigorously tested on UCI, KEEL, and AwA benchmark datasets.

Preregistered at OSF on Nov 14, 2025 (https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/BMVP3).

This paper introduces the Principle of Proportional Duty (PPD), a novel framework that models how ethical responsibility scales with an agent's epistemic state. The framework reveals that moral duty is not lost to uncertainty but transforms: as uncertainty increases, Action Duty (the duty to act decisively) is proportionally converted into Repair Duty (the active duty to verify, inquire, and resolve uncertainty).\n  This dynamic is expressed by the equation D_total = K[(1-HI) + HI * g(C_signal)], where Total Duty is a function of Knowledge (K), Humility/Uncertainty (HI), and Contextual Signal Strength (C_signal). Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that systems maintaining a baseline humility coefficient (lambda > 0) produce more stable duty allocations and reduce the risk of overconfident decision-making.\n  By formalizing humility as a system parameter, the PPD offers a mathematically tractable approach to moral responsibility that could inform the development of auditable AI decision systems. This paper applies the framework across four domains, clinical ethics, recipient-rights law, economic governance, and artificial intelligence, to demonstrate its cross-disciplinary validity. The findings suggest that proportional duty serves as a stabilizing principle within complex systems, preventing both overreach and omission by dynamically balancing epistemic confidence against contextual risk.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc724\ub9ac\uc801 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud55c \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc758\uc0ac

These operations are run by organized crime syndicates that traffic thousands of people into forced labor, requiring them to build emotional intimacy with victims over weeks of text conversations before pressuring them into fraudulent cryptocurrency investments. Because the scams are inherently text-based, they raise urgent questions about the role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in both current and future automation.\n  We investigate this intersection by interviewing 145 insiders and 5 scam victims, performing a blinded long-term conversation study comparing LLM scam agents to human operators, and executing an evaluation of commercial safety filters. Our findings show that LLMs are already widely deployed within scam organizations, with 87% of scam labor consisting of systematized conversational tasks readily susceptible to automation. In a week-long study, an LLM agent not only elicited greater trust from study participants (p=0.007) but also achieved higher compliance with requests than human operators (46% vs. 18% for humans). Meanwhile, popular safety filters detected 0.0% of romance baiting dialogues. Together, these results suggest that romance-baiting scams may be amenable to full-scale LLM automation, while existing defenses remain inadequate to prevent their expansion.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub85c\ub9e8\uc2a4 \uc720\uc778 \uc0ac\uae30\ub294 \uc804 \uc138\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc7ac\uc815\uc801, \uc815\uc11c\uc801 \ud53c\ud574\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc6d0\uc778\uc774 \ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, LLM\uc758 \uc5ed\ud560\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc9c8\ubb38\uc774 \uc81c\uae30\ub41c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub85c\ub9e8\uc2a4 \uc720\uc778 \uc0ac\uae30\ub294 \uc870\uc9c1 \ubc94\uc8c4 \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc6b4\uc601\ub418\uba70, \ud53c\ud574\uc790\uc640\uc758 \uc815\uc11c\uc801 \uce5c\ubc00\uac10\uc744 \uc313\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ub300\ud654\uac00 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "145\uba85\uc758 \ub0b4\ubd80\uc790\uc640 5\uba85\uc758 \ud53c\ud574\uc790\ub97c \uc778\ud130\ubdf0\ud558\uace0, LLM \uc0ac\uae30 \ub300\ud589\uc790\uc640 \uc778\uac04 \uc6b4\uc601\uc790\ub97c \ube44\uad50\ud558\ub294 \uc7a5\uae30 \ub300\ud654 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud558\uba70 \uc0c1\uc5c5\uc801 \uc548\uc804 \ud544\ud130\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud588\ub2e4.", "result": "LLM\uc740 \uc774\ubbf8 \uc0ac\uae30 \uc870\uc9c1 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, 87%\uc758 \uc0ac\uae30 \ub178\ub3d9\uc774 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\ud654\ub41c \ub300\ud654 \uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\ub2e4.

The main focus of this dissertation is on creating and testing an intelligent production system for XRIT that solves important problems like energy management, predictive maintenance, and AI-powered decision support. Machine learning models are built into the system, such as the Random Forest Classifier for proactive maintenance and the Isolation Forest for finding outliers. These models help with decision-making and reducing downtime. Streamlit makes real-time data visualisation possible, giving workers access to dashboards that they can interact with and see real-time observations.The system was tested with fake data and is made to be scalable, so it can be used in real time in XRIT's production setting. Adding an AI-powered virtual assistant made with GPT-4 lets workers get real-time, useful information that makes complicated questions easier to answer and improves operational decisions.

We investigate the Privileged Information Bias (or \"Curse of Knowledge\"), where a knowledgeable \"Leader\" agent fails to guide a sensor-limited \"Follower\" due to a lack of Theory of Mind. To quantify this phenomenon, we propose a novel Asymmetric Assistive Reasoning framework within AI2-THOR. Our experiments reveal a significant \"Success Gap\": while the Leader successfully perceives the target in 35.0% of episodes, the collaborative team succeeds only 17.0% of the time, implying that nearly 50% of feasible plans fail solely due to communicative grounding errors. We demonstrate that a \"Pull-based\" protocol (active querying) is significantly more robust than standard \"Push-based\" instruction, with successful episodes featuring 2x the frequency of clarification requests.

However, this architecture also introduces a new and severe privacy risk, which we term Tools Orchestration Privacy Risk (TOP-R), where an agent, to achieve a benign user goal, autonomously aggregates information fragments across multiple tools and leverages its reasoning capabilities to synthesize unexpected sensitive information. We provide the first systematic study of this risk. First, we establish a formal framework, attributing the risk's root cause to the agent's misaligned objective function: an overoptimization for helpfulness while neglecting privacy awareness. Second, we construct TOP-Bench, comprising paired leakage and benign scenarios, to comprehensively evaluate this risk. To quantify the trade-off between safety and robustness, we introduce the H-Score as a holistic metric. The evaluation results reveal that TOP-R is a severe risk: the average Risk Leakage Rate (RLR) of eight representative models reaches 90.24%, while the average H-Score is merely 0.167, with no model exceeding 0.3. Finally, we propose the Privacy Enhancement Principle (PEP) method, which effectively mitigates TOP-R, reducing the Risk Leakage Rate to 46.58% and significantly improving the H-Score to 0.624. Our work reveals both a new class of risk and inherent structural limitations in current agent architectures, while also offering feasible mitigation strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774

This tutorial introduces the method, explaining how it transforms experimental data into compact physical laws that reveal compact dimensional invariance between variables. The approach combines classical dimensional analysis with modern machine learning techniques. Starting from measurements of physical quantities, the method identifies the fundamental ways to combine variables into dimensionless groups, then uses neural networks to discover which combinations best predict the experimental output. A key innovation is a regularization technique that encourages the learned coefficients to take simple, interpretable values like integers or half-integers, making the discovered laws both accurate and physically meaningful. We systematically investigate how measurement noise and discrete sampling affect the discovery process, demonstrating that the regularization approach provides robustness to experimental uncertainties. The method successfully handles cases with single or multiple dimensionless numbers, revealing how different but equivalent representations can capture the same underlying physics. Despite recent progress, key challenges remain, including managing the computational cost of identifying multiple dimensionless groups, understanding the influence of data characteristics, automating the selection of relevant input variables, and developing user-friendly tools for experimentalists. This tutorial serves as both an educational resource and a practical guide for researchers seeking to apply dimensionless learning to their experimental data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ucc28\uc6d0

However, current model-centric agent architectures struggle to self-evolve post-deployment: improving personalization, capability, and efficiency typically requires continuous model retraining/fine-tuning, which incurs prohibitive computational overheads and suffers from an inherent trade-off between model accuracy and inference efficiency.\n  To enable iterative self-evolution without model retraining, we propose MOBIMEM, a memory-centric agent system. MOBIMEM first introduces three specialized memory primitives to decouple agent evolution from model weights: (1) Profile Memory uses a lightweight distance-graph (DisGraph) structure to align with user preferences, resolving the accuracy-latency trade-off in user profile retrieval; (2) Experience Memory employs multi-level templates to instantiate execution logic for new tasks, ensuring capability generalization; and (3) Action Memory records fine-grained interaction sequences, reducing the reliance on expensive model inference. Building upon this memory architecture, MOBIMEM further integrates a suite of OS-inspired services to orchestrate execution: a scheduler that coordinates parallel sub-task execution and memory operations; an agent record-and-replay (AgentRR) mechanism that enables safe and efficient action reuse; and a context-aware exception handling that ensures graceful recovery from user interruptions and runtime errors.\n  Evaluation on AndroidWorld and top-50 apps shows that MOBIMEM achieves 83.1% profile alignment with 23.83 ms retrieval time (280x faster than GraphRAG baselines), improves task success rates by up to 50.3%, and reduces end-to-end latency by up to 9x on mobile devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "MOBIMEM\uc740 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc911\uc2ec \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378 \uc7ac\ud6c8\ub828 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ub9de\ucda4\ud615 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud604\uc7ac \ubaa8\ub378 \uc911\uc2ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uad6c\uc870\ub294 \ubc30\uce58 \uc774\ud6c4\uc758 \uc790\uae30 \uc9c4\ud654\ub97c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6cc\ud558\uba70, \uc815\ubc00\ub3c4\uc640 \ucd94\ub860 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \ubb34\uc5ed \uc624\ud504\uac00 \uc874\uc7ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "MOBIMEM\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc9c4\ud654\ub97c \ubaa8\ub378 \uac00\uc911\uce58\uc640 \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc804\ubb38 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc6d0\uc2dc\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4: 1) \ud504\ub85c\ud30c\uc77c \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac, 2) \uacbd\ud5d8 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac, 3) \uc561\uc158 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac.", "result": "MOBIMEM\uc740 \uc571 \uc2e4\ud589\uc5d0\uc11c 83.1%\uc758 \ud504\ub85c\ud30c\uc77c \uc815\ub82c\uacfc 23.83ms\uc758 \uac80\uc0c9 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \uae30\ub85d\ud558\uba70, \uc791\uc5c5 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \ucd5c\ub300 50.3% \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c \uc7a5\uce58\uc5d0\uc11c \uc885\ub2e8 \uac04 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \ucd5c\ub300 9\ubc30 \uc904\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "MOBIMEM\uc740 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc911\uc2ec \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uac00\uc838\uc628\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c \ubc0f \ub370\uc2a4\ud06c\ud0d1 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub97c \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc774 \ubc30\ud3ec\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc911\uc2ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub294 \ubc30\uce58 \ud6c4 \uc790\uae30 \uc9c4\ud654\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uac1c\uc778\ud654, \uae30\ub2a5 \ubc0f \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc7ac\ud6c8\ub828/\ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub294 \uc5c4\uccad\ub09c \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uc720\ubc1c\ud558\uace0 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uacfc \ucd94\ub860 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \ub0b4\uc7ac\uc801 \ubb34\uc5ed \uc624\ud504\ub97c \uac16\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubaa8\ub378 \uc7ac\ud6c8\ub828 \uc5c6\uc774 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \uc790\uae30 \uc9c4\ud654\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 MOBIMEM\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc911\uc2ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

In traditional adversarial settings, code obfuscation has long been used as a general strategy to bypass auditing tools, preserving exploitability without tampering with the tools themselves. Numerous efforts have explored obfuscation methods and tools, yet their capabilities differ in terms of supported techniques, granularity, and programming languages, making it difficult to systematically assess their impact on LLM-based vulnerability detection. To address this gap, we provide a structured systematization of obfuscation techniques and evaluate them under a unified framework. Specifically, we categorize existing obfuscation methods into three major classes (layout, data flow, and control flow) covering 11 subcategories and 19 concrete techniques. We implement these techniques across four programming languages (Solidity, C, C++, and Python) using a consistent LLM-driven approach, and evaluate their effects on 15 LLMs spanning four model families (DeepSeek, OpenAI, Qwen, and LLaMA), as well as on two coding agents (GitHub Copilot and Codex). Our findings reveal both positive and negative impacts of code obfuscation on LLM-based vulnerability detection, highlighting conditions under which obfuscation leads to performance improvements or degradations. We further analyze these outcomes with respect to vulnerability characteristics, code properties, and model attributes. Finally, we outline several open problems and propose future directions to enhance the robustness of LLMs for real-world vulnerability detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774

These scenarios are central to multimodal audio-video understanding, where models must jointly reason over audio and visual streams in applications such as conversational video assistants and meeting analytics. We introduce AMUSE, a benchmark designed around tasks that are inherently agentic, requiring models to decompose complex audio-visual interactions into planning, grounding, and reflection steps. It evaluates MLLMs across three modes zero-shot, guided, and agentic and six task families, including spatio-temporal speaker grounding and multimodal dialogue summarization. Across all modes, current models exhibit weak multi-speaker reasoning and inconsistent behavior under both non-agentic and agentic evaluation. Motivated by the inherently agentic nature of these tasks and recent advances in LLM agents, we propose RAFT, a data-efficient agentic alignment framework that integrates reward optimization with intrinsic multimodal self-evaluation as reward and selective parameter adaptation for data and parameter efficient updates. Using RAFT, we achieve up to 39.52\\% relative improvement in accuracy on our benchmark. Together, AMUSE and RAFT provide a practical platform for examining agentic reasoning in multimodal models and improving their capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ucd5c\uadfc\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(MLLM)\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud654\uc790\uc640 \ub300\ud654 \uc911\uc2ec \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc801 \ucd94\uc801\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 AMUSE\ub77c\ub294 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, RAFT\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uc624\ub514\uc624-\ube44\ub514\uc624 \uc774\ud574\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud558\uba70, \ucd5c\uc2e0 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc774 \uc774\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \ub3d9\uae30\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd9c\ubc1c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "method": "AMUSE \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc624\ub514\uc624-\ube44\uc8fc\uc5bc \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uacc4\ud68d, \uadfc\uac70 \ubc0f \ubc18\uc601 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc801 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud558\uba70, MLLM\uc744 \uac04\ud3b8\ud558\uac8c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 RAFT\ub77c\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "RAFT\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ucd5c\ub300 39.52\u001f \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "AMUSE\uc640 RAFT\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uace0 \uadf8 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uadfc\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(MLLM)\uc778 GPT-4o\uc640 Qwen3-Omni\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc778\uc2dd\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub204\uac00 \ub9d0\ud558\ub294\uc9c0 \ucd94\uc801\ud558\uace0 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba70 \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc0ac\uac74\uc758 \uadfc\uac70\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud654\uc790 \ub300\ud654 \uc911\uc2ec \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub294 \ub300\ud654\ud615 \ube44\ub514\uc624 \uc5b4\uc2dc\uc2a4\ud134\ud2b8 \ubc0f \ud68c\uc758 \ubd84\uc11d\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c \uc624\ub514\uc624\uc640 \ube44\uc8fc\uc5bc \uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9bc\uc744 \ud568\uaed8 \ucd94\ub860\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uc624\ub514\uc624-\ube44\ub514\uc624 \uc774\ud574\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec\uc774\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc624\ub514\uc624-\ube44\uc8fc\uc5bc \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uacc4\ud68d, \uadfc\uac70, \ubc18\uc601 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc801 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc778 AMUSE\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 MLLM\uc744 \uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7, \uc720\ub3c4 \ubc0f \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc801 \ubaa8\ub4dc\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubaa8\ub4dc\uc640 \uc2dc\uacf5\uac04 \ud654\uc790 \uadfc\uac70 \ubc0f \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ub300\ud654 \uc694\uc57d\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uc5ec\uc12f \uac00\uc9c0 \uc791\uc5c5 \uad70\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ubaa8\ub4dc\uc5d0\uc11c \ud604\uc7ac \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uc740 \uc57d\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \ud654\uc790 \ucd94\ub860\uacfc \ube44\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc801 \ubc0f \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc801 \ud3c9\uac00 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc801 \uc131\uaca9\uacfc \ucd5c\uadfc LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc5d0 \ub3d9\uae30\ub97c \ubd80\uc5ec\ubc1b\uc544, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \ub0b4\uc7ac\uc801 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uc790\uae30 \ud3c9\uac00\uc640 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubc0f \uc120\ud0dd\uc801 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \uc801\uc751\uc744 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc801 \uc815\ub82c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 RAFT\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

We present SALVE (Sparse Autoencoder-Latent Vector Editing), a unified \"discover, validate, and control\" framework that bridges mechanistic interpretability and model editing. Using an $\\ell_1$-regularized autoencoder, we learn a sparse, model-native feature basis without supervision. We validate these features with Grad-FAM, a feature-level saliency mapping method that visually grounds latent features in input data. Leveraging the autoencoder's structure, we perform precise and permanent weight-space interventions, enabling continuous modulation of both class-defining and cross-class features. We further derive a critical suppression threshold, $\u03b1_{crit}$, quantifying each class's reliance on its dominant feature, supporting fine-grained robustness diagnostics. Our approach is validated on both convolutional (ResNet-18) and transformer-based (ViT-B/16) models, demonstrating consistent, interpretable control over their behavior.

Most of the standard RAG frameworks regard all retrieved information as equally reliable, overlooking the varying credibility and interconnected nature of large textual corpora. GraphRAG approaches offer potential improvement to RAG systems by integrating knowledge graphs, which structure information into nodes and edges, capture entity relationships, and enable multi-step logical traversal. However, GraphRAG is not always an ideal solution as it depends on high-quality graph representations of the corpus, which requires either pre-existing knowledge graphs that are expensive to build and update, or automated graph construction pipelines that are often unreliable. Moreover, systems following this paradigm typically use large language models to guide graph traversal and evidence retrieval, leading to challenges similar to those encountered with standard RAG. In this paper, we propose a novel RAG framework that employs the spreading activation algorithm to retrieve information from a corpus of documents interconnected by automatically constructed knowledge graphs, thereby enhancing the performance of large language models on complex tasks such as multi-hop question answering. Experiments show that our method achieves better or comparable performance to iterative RAG methodologies, while also being easily integrable as a plug-and-play module with a wide range of RAG-based approaches.

However, existing research faces two limitations: (1) the high complexity of optimizing water-nitrogen combinations during crop growth and poor yield optimization results; and (2) the difficulty in quantifying mild stress signals and the delayed feedback, which results in less precise dynamic regulation of water and nitrogen and lower resource utilization efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a Nested Dual-Agent Reinforcement Learning (NDRL) method. The parent agent in NDRL identifies promising macroscopic irrigation and fertilization actions based on projected cumulative yield benefits, reducing ineffective explorationwhile maintaining alignment between objectives and yield. The child agent's reward function incorporates quantified Water Stress Factor (WSF) and Nitrogen Stress Factor (NSF), and uses a mixed probability distribution to dynamically optimize daily strategies, thereby enhancing both yield and resource efficiency. We used field experiment data from 2023 and 2024 to calibrate and validate the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) to simulate real-world conditions and interact with NDRL.

While traditional low-rank approximations often rely on static rank assumptions--limiting their flexibility across diverse input contexts--our method dynamically selects ranks based on real-time sequence dynamics, layer-specific sensitivities, and hardware constraints. The core innovation lies in an RL agent that formulates rank selection as a sequential policy optimization problem, where the reward function strictly balances attention fidelity against computational latency. Crucially, we employ online matrix perturbation bounds to enable incremental rank updates, thereby avoiding the prohibitive cost of full decomposition during inference. Furthermore, the integration of a lightweight Transformer-based policy network and batched Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) operations ensures scalable deployment on modern GPU architectures. Experiments demonstrate that DR-RL maintains downstream accuracy statistically equivalent to full-rank attention while significantly reducing Floating Point Operations (FLOPs), particularly in long-sequence regimes (L > 4096). This work bridges the gap between adaptive efficiency and theoretical rigor in MHSA, offering a principled, mathematically grounded alternative to heuristic rank reduction techniques in resource-constrained deep learning.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across diverse tasks, their extensive computational requirements make them cost-prohibitive for routine enterprise use. This limitation motivates the exploration of Small Language Models (SLMs), which can deliver comparable performance in targeted applications while drastically reducing infrastructure overhead (Irugalbandara et al., 2023). In this work, we investigate the feasibility of replacing LLM-driven workflows with optimized SLMs. We trained a domain-adapted SLM to execute representative tasks traditionally handled by LLMs, such as document summarization, query answering, and structured data interpretation. As part of the experiment, we investigated the fine-tuning of facebook/opt-350m model (single epoch only) using the Hugging Face TRL (Transformer Reinforcement Learning), specifically the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) trainer. The OPT-350M model was released by Meta AI in 2022 as part of the OPT (Open Pretrained Transformer) family of models. Similar studies demonstrate that even models at the 350M parameter scale can meaningfully contribute to instruction-tuning pipelines (Mekala et al., 2024). Experimental results demonstrated that our fine-tuned SLM achieves exceptional performance with a 77.55\\% pass rate on ToolBench evaluation, significantly outperforming all baseline models including ChatGPT-CoT (26.00\\%), ToolLLaMA-DFS (30.18\\%), and ToolLLaMA-CoT (16.27\\%). These findings emphasize that thoughtful design and targeted training of SLMs can significantly lower barriers to adoption, enabling cost-effective, large-scale integration of generative AI into production systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \uc18c\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(SLM)\ub85c \ub300\uccb4\ud558\ub294 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\uba70, SLM\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ube44\uc6a9 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc6b4\uc601 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc870\uc9c1\uc774 \uc0dd\uc131\uc801 AI\uc758 \ucc44\ud0dd\uc744 \ud655\ub300\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ubaa8\ub378 \ube44\uc6a9 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc640 \uc6b4\uc601 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc774 \uc9c0\uc18d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uacfc \uc811\uadfc\uc131\uc744 \uacb0\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc694\uc18c\ub85c \ubd80\uac01\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub300\ud45c\uc801\uc778 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc801\uc751\ub41c SLM\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5ec\uae30\uc5d0\ub294 \ubb38\uc11c \uc694\uc57d, \ucffc\ub9ac \uc751\ub2f5 \ubc0f \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud574\uc11d\uc774 \ud3ec\ud568\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc758 \uc77c\ud658\uc73c\ub85c Hugging Face TRL\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec facebook/opt-350m \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud30c\uc778 \ud29c\ub2dd\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uac00 \ud30c\uc778 \ud29c\ub2dd\ud55c SLM\uc740 ToolBench \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0\uc11c 77.55%\uc758 \ud569\uaca9\ub960\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc5ec ChatGPT-CoT(26.00%), ToolLLaMA-DFS(30.18%), ToolLLaMA-CoT(16.27%)\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uae30\uc900 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\ub294 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "SLM\uc758 \uc0ac\ub824 \uae4a\uc740 \uc124\uacc4\uc640 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc9c0\ud5a5\uc801 \ud6c8\ub828\uc774 \ucc44\ud0dd \uc7a5\ubcbd\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ub0ae\ucdb0\uc8fc\ub294 \uc810\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70, \uc0dd\uc131\uc801 AI\uc758 \ube44\uc6a9 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ud1b5\ud569\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc870\uc9c1\uc774 \uc0dd\uc131\uc801 AI\uc758 \ucc44\ud0dd\uc744 \ud655\ub300\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ubaa8\ub378 \ube44\uc6a9 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc640 \uc6b4\uc601 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc774 \uc9c0\uc18d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uacfc \uc811\uadfc\uc131\uc744 \uacb0\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc694\uc18c\ub85c \ubd80\uac01\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub4e4\uc758 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc740 \uc77c\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \uae30\uc5c5 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc5d0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4ed\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub294 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c \ube44\uad50 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc778\ud504\ub77c \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c \ud06c\uac8c \uc904\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc18c\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(SLM)\uc758 \ud0d0\uad6c\ub97c \ucd09\uc9c4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud750\ub984\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub41c SLM\uc73c\ub85c \ub300\uccb4\ud558\ub294 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubb38\uc11c \uc694\uc57d, \ucffc\ub9ac \uc751\ub2f5 \ubc0f \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud574\uc11d\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c LLM\uc774 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \ub300\ud45c\uc801\uc778 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc801\uc751\ud615 SLM\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c Hugging Face TRL\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec facebook/opt-350m \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud30c\uc778 \ud29c\ub2dd\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, both transfer learning and the exploitation of spatial variability in this field are challenging, as they involve heterogeneous data and complex cross-scale dependencies. Conventional approaches often rely on location-independent parameterizations and independent training, underutilizing transfer learning and spatial heterogeneity in the inputs, and limiting their applicability in regions with substantial variability. We propose FTBSC-KGML (Fine-Tuning-Based Site Calibration-Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning), a pretraining- and fine-tuning-based, spatial-variability-aware, and knowledge-guided machine learning framework that augments KGML-ag with a pretraining-fine-tuning process and site-specific parameters. Using a pretraining-fine-tuning process with remote-sensing GPP, climate, and soil covariates collected across multiple midwestern sites, FTBSC-KGML estimates land emissions while leveraging transfer learning and spatial heterogeneity. A key component is a spatial-heterogeneity-aware transfer-learning scheme, which is a globally pretrained model that is fine-tuned at each state or site to learn place-aware representations, thereby improving local accuracy under limited data without sacrificing interpretability.

Human intelligence is adept at synthesizing new objective functions on the fly. How does this work, and can we endow artificial systems with the same ability?

We open-source the model together with the full infrastructure stack used to create it, including RL frameworks, complete recipe, and a wide collection of environments, built with the verifiers library, for training and evaluation from our Environments Hub community platform. Built for this effort, we introduce prime-rl, an open framework for large-scale asynchronous reinforcement learning, which scales seamlessly from a single node to thousands of GPUs, and is tailored for agentic RL with first-class support for multi-turn interactions and tool use.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer powerful reasoning capabilities, their direct application to time series forecasting has proven ineffective. We address this gap by repositioning the LLM as an intelligent judge that evaluates, explains, and strategically coordinates an ensemble of foundation models. To overcome the LLM's inherent lack of domain-specific knowledge on time series, we introduce an R1-style finetuning process, guided by SHAP-based faithfulness scores, which teaches the model to interpret ensemble weights as meaningful causal statements about temporal dynamics. The trained agent then engages in iterative, multi-turn conversations to perform forward-looking assessments, provide causally-grounded explanations for its weighting decisions, and adaptively refine the optimization strategy. Validated on the GIFT-Eval benchmark on 23 datasets across 97 settings, our approach significantly outperforms leading time series foundation models on both CRPS and MASE metrics, establishing new state-of-the-art results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uc559\uc0c1\ube14 \ubaa8\ub378 \uad6c\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud574 Large Language Models(LLMs)\ub97c \uc7ac\ubc30\uce58\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc99d\uac00\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uc6b0\uc704\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \ub2e8\uc77c \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc5c6\uc73c\uba70, \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uc559\uc0c1\ube14 \uad6c\uc131\uacfc \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \uc8fc\uc694 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "LLM\uc744 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc801\uc778 \ud310\ubcc4\uc790\ub85c \uc7ac\ubc30\uce58\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc559\uc0c1\ube14\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc124\uba85\ud558\uba70 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\uace0, SHAP \uae30\ubc18 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uc810\uc218\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c R1 \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c\uc758 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 23\uac1c\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc640 97\uac1c\uc758 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c GIFT-Eval \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uac80\uc99d\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, CRPS\uc640 MASE \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc5d0\uc11c \uc120\ub3c4\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud604\uc800\ud788 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec \uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc608\uce21\uc758 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc5f4\uc5b4\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud655\uc0b0\uc740 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uc6b0\uc704\ub97c \uac00\uc9c0\ub294 \ub2e8\uc77c \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc5c6\ub2e4\ub294 landscape\ub97c \ub9cc\ub4e4\uc5b4, \uc911\uc2ec\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ucd5c\uc0c1\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ucc3e\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uac16\ucd98 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uc559\uc0c1\ube14\uc744 \uad6c\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \uc124\uc815\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc740 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0\uc758 \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc778 \uc801\uc6a9\uc740 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc785\uc99d\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 LLM\uc744 \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc559\uc0c1\ube14\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc124\uba85\ud558\uba70 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc801\uc778 \ud310\ubcc4\uc790\ub85c \uc7ac\ubc30\uce58\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Although machine learning methods have shown encouraging results, progress is hindered by data scarcity and heterogeneity arising from diverse aging conditions. In other fields, foundation models (FMs) trained on diverse datasets have achieved broad generalization through transfer learning, but no FMs have been reported for battery cycle life prediction yet. Here we present the Pretrained Battery Transformer (PBT), the first FM for battery life prediction, developed through domain-knowledge-encoded mixture-of-expert layers. Validated on the largest public battery life database, PBT learns transferable representations from 13 lithium-ion battery (LIB) datasets, outperforming existing models by an average of 19.8%. With transfer learning, PBT achieves state-of-the-art performance across 15 diverse datasets encompassing various operating conditions, formation protocols, and chemistries of LIBs.

This paper proposes WeMusic-Agent, a training framework for efficient LLM-based conversational music recommendation. By integrating the knowledge internalization and agentic boundary learning, the framework aims to teach the model to intelligently decide when to leverage internalized knowledge and when to call specialized tools (e.g., music retrieval APIs, music recommendation systems). Under this framework, we present WeMusic-Agent-M1, an agentic model that internalizes extensive musical knowledge via continued pretraining on 50B music-related corpus while acquiring the ability to invoke external tools when necessary. Additionally, considering the lack of open-source benchmarks for conversational music recommendation, we also construct a benchmark for personalized music recommendations derived from real-world data in WeChat Listen. This benchmark enables comprehensive evaluation across multiple dimensions, including relevance, personalization, and diversity of the recommendations. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate that WeMusic-Agent achieves significant improvements over existing models.", "AI": {"tldr": "WeMusic-Agent\ub294 \uc74c\uc545 \ucd94\ucc9c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud6c8\ub828 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc120\ud638\uc640 \uc74c\uc545\uc801 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uc5ec \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ub300\ud654\ud615 \uc74c\uc545 \ucd94\ucc9c\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud654\ud615 \uc74c\uc545 \ucd94\ucc9c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc120\ud638\uc640 \uc74c\uc545\uc801 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uae4a\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uc774\ud574\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uc804\ubb38 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uacfc \uc720\uc5f0\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c \ud1b5\ud569\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\ub294\ub2e4.", "method": "WeMusic-Agent\ub294 \ub0b4\ubd80 \uc9c0\uc2dd \ub0b4\uc7ac\ud654\uc640 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uacbd\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc5b8\uc81c \ub0b4\ubd80 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uace0 \uc5b8\uc81c \uc804\ubb38 \ub3c4\uad6c(\uc608: \uc74c\uc545 \uac80\uc0c9 API, \uc74c\uc545 \ucd94\ucc9c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c)\ub97c \ud638\ucd9c\ud560\uc9c0\ub97c \uacb0\uc815\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "result": "WeMusic-Agent-M1\uc740 500\uc5b5 \uc74c\uc545 \uad00\ub828 \ucf54\ud37c\uc2a4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub9ac\ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ub2dd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubc29\ub300\ud55c \uc74c\uc545 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ub0b4\uc7ac\ud654\ud558\uace0 \ud544\uc694 \uc2dc \uc678\ubd80 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \ud638\ucd9c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc2b5\ub4dd\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, WeMusic-Agent\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc720\uc758\ubbf8\ud55c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c \uc74c\uc545 \ucd94\ucc9c\uc740 \ub300\ud654 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc120\ud638 \ubc0f \ubbf8\uc138\ud55c \uc74c\uc545\uc801 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc744 \uae4a\uc774 \uc774\ud574\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\uc73c\ub098, \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uc804\ubb38 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uacfc \uc720\uc5f0\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c \ud1b5\ud569\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\ub294 \ub370 \uc790\uc8fc \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\ub294\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ub300\ud654\ud615 \uc74c\uc545 \ucd94\ucc9c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud6c8\ub828 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 WeMusic-Agent\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc9c0\uc2dd \ub0b4\uc7ac\ud654\uc640 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uacbd\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc5b8\uc81c \ub0b4\ubd80\ud654\ub41c \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uace0 \uc5b8\uc81c \uc804\ubb38 \ub3c4\uad6c(\uc608: \uc74c\uc545 \uac80\uc0c9 API, \uc74c\uc545 \ucd94\ucc9c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c)\ub97c \ud638\ucd9c\ud560\uc9c0\ub97c \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uacb0\uc815\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uad50\uc721\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c \ud558\uc5d0, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 500\uc5b5 \uc74c\uc545 \uad00\ub828 \ucf54\ud37c\uc2a4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub9ac\ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ub2dd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubc29\ub300\ud55c \uc74c\uc545 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ub0b4\uc7ac\ud654\ud558\uba70 \ud544\uc694\uc2dc \uc678\ubd80 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \ud638\ucd9c\ud560 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud68d\ub4dd\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubaa8\ub378\uc778 WeMusic-Agent-M1\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \ub300\ud654\ud615 \uc74c\uc545 \ucd94\ucc9c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc624\ud508\uc18c\uc2a4 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc758 \ubd80\uc871\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud558\uc5ec, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 WeChat Listen\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c \uc74c\uc545 \ucd94\ucc9c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub294 \uad00\ub828\uc131, \uac1c\uc778\ud654 \ubc0f \ucd94\ucc9c\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131 \ub4f1 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ucc28\uc6d0\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, WeMusic-Agent\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc720\uc758\ubbf8\ud55c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\ub2e4."}}

However, the lack of effective evaluation methodologies has made it difficult to estimate the risk of bias, making deployment of such systems unsafe in high stakes domains such as consumer finance, where biased decisions can translate directly into regulatory breaches and financial loss. To address this challenge, we need to develop fairness evaluation methodologies for multi-agent predictive systems and measure the fairness characteristics of these systems in the financial tabular domain. Examining fairness metrics using large-scale simulations across diverse multi-agent configurations, with varying communication and collaboration mechanisms, we reveal patterns of emergent bias in financial decision-making that cannot be traced to individual agent components, indicating that multi-agent systems may exhibit genuinely collective behaviors. Our findings highlight that fairness risks in financial multi-agent systems represent a significant component of model risk, with tangible impacts on tasks such as credit scoring and income estimation. We advocate that multi-agent decision systems must be evaluated as holistic entities rather than through reductionist analyses of their constituent components.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub2e4\uc911

Traditional methods for PDE solving are cumbersome, relying on manual setup and domain expertise. While Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINNs) introduced end-to-end neural network-based solutions, and frameworks like DeepXDE further enhanced automation, these approaches still depend on expert knowledge and lack full autonomy. In this work, we frame PDE solving as tool invocation via LLM-driven agents and introduce PDE-Agent, the first toolchain-augmented multi-agent collaboration framework, inheriting the reasoning capacity of LLMs and the controllability of external tools and enabling automated PDE solving from natural language descriptions. PDE-Agent leverages the strengths of multi-agent and multi-tool collaboration through two key innovations: (1) A Prog-Act framework with graph memory for multi-agent collaboration, which enables effective dynamic planning and error correction via dual-loop mechanisms (localized fixes and global revisions). (2) A Resource-Pool integrated with a tool-parameter separation mechanism for multi-tool collaboration. This centralizes the management of runtime artifacts and resolves inter-tool dependency gaps in existing frameworks. To validate and evaluate this new paradigm for PDE solving , we develop PDE-Bench, a multi-type PDE Benchmark for agent-based tool collaborative solving, and propose multi-level metrics for assessing tool coordination. Evaluations verify that PDE-Agent exhibits superior applicability and performance in complex multi-step, cross-step dependent tasks.

However, current practices remain dominated by ad-hoc scripts and loosely specified workflows, which lack principled abstractions, hinder reproducibility, and offer limited support for model-in-the-loop data generation. To address these challenges, we present DataFlow, a unified and extensible LLM-driven data preparation framework. DataFlow is designed with system-level abstractions that enable modular, reusable, and composable data transformations, and provides a PyTorch-style pipeline construction API for building debuggable and optimizable dataflows. The framework consists of nearly 200 reusable operators and six domain-general pipelines spanning text, mathematical reasoning, code, Text-to-SQL, agentic RAG, and large-scale knowledge extraction. To further improve usability, we introduce DataFlow-Agent, which automatically translates natural-language specifications into executable pipelines via operator synthesis, pipeline planning, and iterative verification. Across six representative use cases, DataFlow consistently improves downstream LLM performance. Our math, code, and text pipelines outperform curated human datasets and specialized synthetic baselines, achieving up to +3\\% execution accuracy in Text-to-SQL over SynSQL, +7\\% average improvements on code benchmarks, and 1--3 point gains on MATH, GSM8K, and AIME.

Prevailing efforts to address this through enhancing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are trapped in a dilemma: template-based datasets are scalable but structurally rigid, while manual annotation is linguistically diverse but unscalable and, critically, computationally imprecise. We introduce SPRITE, a novel framework that overcomes this dilemma by leveraging simulators and large models to programmatically synthesize scalable, diverse, and high-quality spatial reasoning data. The core innovation of SPRITE is to reframe ground-truth generation as a code-generation task. We utilize LLMs to compile complex spatial questions into executable programs, which are then verified against high-precision scene meta-information extracted from simulators. This ensures our ground truth is both computationally precise and verifiable, while the generative power of LLMs provides vast linguistic diversity. Leveraging this pipeline, we have curated a dataset encompassing 3 simulators, 11k+ scenes, and 300k+ image/video instruction-tuning pairs. We demonstrate that a VLM trained on our data achieves significant performance gains on multiple spatial benchmarks and outperforms other open-source datasets of equivalent size.

Prefix caching partially alleviates some of these costs by reusing KV cache for previously processed tokens, but limited by strict prefix matching. Position-independent caching (PIC) enables chunk-level reuse at arbitrary positions, but requires selective recomputation and positional-encoding (PE) adjustments. However, because these operations vary across queries, KV for the same chunk diverges across requests. Moreover, without page alignment, chunk KV layouts diverge in memory, preventing page sharing. These issues result in only modest HBM savings even when many requests reuse the same content.\n  We present MEPIC, a memory-efficient PIC system that enables chunk KV reuse across positions, requests, and batches. MEPIC aligns chunk KV to paged storage, shifts recomputation from token- to block-level so only the first block is request-specific, removes positional encodings via Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) fusion in the attention kernel, and makes remaining blocks fully shareable. These techniques eliminate most duplicate chunk KV in HBM, reducing usage by up to 2x over state-of-the-art PIC at comparable latency and accuracy, and up to 5x for long prompts, without any model changes.", "AI": {"tldr": "MEPIC\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc694\uccad\uacfc \ubc30\uce58 \uac04\uc758 \uccad\ud06c KV \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc73c\ub85c, \uae30\uc874\uc758 PIC\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ucd5c\ub300 2\ubc30\uc758 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub7c9\uc744 \uc904\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae34 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc774\ub825\uc744 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \ud604\ub300\uc758 LLM \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc740 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\uc5d0\uc11c \ub192\uc740 \ucc98\ub9ac\ub7c9\uacfc \ub0ae\uc740 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ubbc0\ub85c KV \uce90\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ud070 \uc555\ubc15\uc744 \uc8fc\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "MEPIC\uc740 \uccad\ud06c KV\ub97c \ud398\uc774\uc9c0 \uc800\uc7a5\uc18c\uc5d0 \uc815\ub82c\ud558\uace0, \uc7ac\uacc4\uc0b0\uc744 \ud1a0\ud070 \ub808\ubca8\uc5d0\uc11c \ube14\ub85d \ub808\ubca8\ub85c \uc804\ud658\ud558\uc5ec \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \ube14\ub85d\ub9cc \uc694\uccad \ud2b9\ud654\ub85c \ub9cc\ub4e4\uba70, Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) \uc735\ud569\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc8fc\uc758 \ucee4\ub110\uc5d0\uc11c \uc704\uce58 \uc778\ucf54\ub529\uc744 \uc81c\uac70\ud558\uace0 \ub098\uba38\uc9c0 \ube14\ub85d\uc744 \uc644\uc804\ud788 \uacf5\uc720\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "MEPIC\ub294 HBM\uc5d0\uc11c \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \uc911\ubcf5 \uccad\ud06c KV\ub97c \uc81c\uac70\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\uc804\uc758 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 PIC\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \ucd5c\ub300 2\ubc30 \uc904\uc774\uace0 \uae34 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \ucd5c\ub300 5\ubc30 \uc904\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uae30\ubc95\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378 \ubcc0\uacbd \uc5c6\uc774 \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uc9c0\uc5f0\uacfc \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub85c \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uac1c\uc120\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud604\ub300 LLM \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc778 \uc2ec\uce35 \uc5f0\uad6c \ubcf4\uc870\uc790, \ucf54\ub529 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8, \uc870\ud68c \uc99d\uac15 \uc0dd\uc131(RAG) \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ubb38\uc11c\ub098 \ucf54\ub4dc \uccad\ud06c\ub97c \uacf5\uc720\ud558\ub294 \uae34 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc774\ub825\uc744 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uc5ec \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ub192\uc740 \ucc98\ub9ac\ub7c9\uacfc \ub0ae\uc740 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ubbc0\ub85c Key Value(KV) \uce90\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc555\ubc15\uc744 \uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud504\ub9ac\ud53d\uc2a4 \uce90\uc2f1\uc740 \uc774\uc804\uc5d0 \ucc98\ub9ac\ub41c \ud1a0\ud070\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 KV \uce90\uc2dc\ub97c \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uc77c\ubd80 \uc644\ud654\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \ud504\ub9ac\ud53d\uc2a4 \ub9e4\uce6d\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc81c\ud55c\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc704\uce58 \ub3c5\ub9bd \uce90\uc2f1(PIC)\uc740 \uc784\uc758\uc758 \uc704\uce58\uc5d0\uc11c \uccad\ud06c \uc218\uc900 \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc120\ud0dd\uc801 \uc7ac\uacc4\uc0b0 \ubc0f \uc704\uce58 \uc778\ucf54\ub529(PE) \uc870\uc815\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc740 \ucffc\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ub2e4\ub974\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \uccad\ud06c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c KV\uac00 \uc694\uccad \uac04\uc5d0 \ub2e4\ub985\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \ud398\uc774\uc9c0 \uc815\ub82c\uc774 \uc5c6\uc73c\uba74 \uccad\ud06c KV \ub808\uc774\uc544\uc6c3\uc774 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\ub974\uac8c \ub418\uc5b4 \ud398\uc774\uc9c0 \uacf5\uc720\ub97c \ubc29\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc694\uccad\uc774 \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \ucf58\ud150\uce20\ub97c \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub354\ub77c\ub3c4 HBM \uc808\uc57d\uc774 \ubbf8\ubbf8\ud558\uac8c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0a9\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 MEPIC\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Yet standard schemes (linear weight soups, task vectors, and Fisher-weighted averaging) can preserve loss while quietly destroying alignment. We argue that merging is not a numerical trick but a geometry-constrained operation around an already-aligned anchor: fusion must be steered to respect safety geometry, not validated post hoc.\n  We introduce AlignMerge, a geometry-aware merging framework that makes alignment an explicit invariant. In a local Fisher chart around an instruction-tuned base, we estimate an alignment subspace with projector P_A and optimize:\n  L_AlignMerge = L_geo + lambda_align * L_align + lambda_bud * L_bud,\n  where L_geo keeps the merge close to its experts in Fisher-Rao geometry, L_align penalizes motion along alignment-sensitive directions, and L_bud enforces a soft alignment budget. As the alignment functional we use the decoding-invariant Alignment Quality Index (AQI), a latent-space criterion that captures how cleanly aligned and misaligned behaviors separate in representation space.\n  Across five model families (LLaMA-3 8B, Mistral 7B, Qwen 2, Phi-3.5, Gemma 2), merging safety anchors with task experts, AlignMerge improves alignment metrics (AQI, toxicity, LLM-judge alignment) while matching or exceeding the best expert on instruction-following, reasoning, and helpfulness. It also exhibits smaller alignment-subspace drift and fewer budget violations than Fisher soups, TIES, SafeMerge, and MergeAlign. These results make alignment-preserving merging a first-class design goal and suggest a path to geometry-aware composition of future foundation models.", "AI": {"tldr": "AlignMerge\ub294 \ub300\ud615

However, the RL-trained agents often struggle in tasks that require active exploration and fail to efficiently adapt from trial-and-error experiences. In this paper, we present LaMer, a general Meta-RL framework that enables LLM agents to actively explore and learn from the environment feedback at test time. LaMer consists of two key components: (i) a cross-episode training framework to encourage exploration and long-term rewards optimization; and (ii) in-context policy adaptation via reflection, allowing the agent to adapt their policy from task feedback signal without gradient update. Experiments across diverse environments show that LaMer significantly improves performance over RL baselines, with 11%, 14%, and 19% performance gains on Sokoban, MineSweeper and Webshop, respectively. Moreover, LaMer also demonstrates better generalization to more challenging or previously unseen tasks compared to the RL-trained agents. Overall, our results demonstrate that Meta-RL provides a principled approach to induce exploration in language agents, enabling more robust adaptation to novel environments through learned exploration strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "LaMer\ub294 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud658\uacbd \ud0d0\uc0c9 \ubc0f \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\ub294 \uba54\ud0c0 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "LaMer\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud575\uc2ec \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c\ub2e4: \ud06c\ub85c\uc2a4 \uc5d0\ud53c\uc18c\ub4dc \ud6c8\ub828 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc640 \ubc18\uc0ac\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \uc815\ucc45 \uc801\uc751.", "result": "Sokoban, MineSweeper \ubc0f Webshop\uc5d0\uc11c \uac01\uac01 11%, 14%, 19%\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \uac1c\uc120\uc774 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uba54\ud0c0 RL\uc740 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\ub294 \uc6d0\uce59\uc801 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc740 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ud658\uacbd\uacfc \uc0c1\ud638 \uc791\uc6a9\ud558\uace0 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud134 \uc7a5\uae30 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud6c8\ub828\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud574\uc8fc\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 RL\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc885\uc885 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc2dc\ud589 \ucc29\uc624 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc801\uc751\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc \ud658\uacbd \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\uace0 \ud559\uc2b5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18 \uba54\ud0c0 RL \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 LaMer\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

Recent studies suggest that RLVR can elicit strong mathematical reasoning in LLMs through two seemingly paradoxical mechanisms: spurious rewards, which suppress exploitation by rewarding outcomes unrelated to the ground truth, and entropy minimization, which suppresses exploration by pushing the model toward more confident and deterministic outputs, highlighting a puzzling dynamic: both discouraging exploitation and discouraging exploration improve reasoning performance, yet the underlying principles that reconcile these effects remain poorly understood. We focus on two fundamental questions: (i) how policy entropy relates to performance, and (ii) whether spurious rewards yield gains, potentially through the interplay of clipping bias and model contamination. Our results show that clipping bias under spurious rewards reduces policy entropy, leading to more confident and deterministic outputs, while entropy minimization alone is insufficient for improvement. We further propose a reward-misalignment model explaining why spurious rewards can enhance performance beyond contaminated settings. Our findings clarify the mechanisms behind spurious-reward benefits and provide principles for more effective RLVR training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uac15\ud654\ud559\uc2b5\uacfc \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8ec\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uac15\ud654\ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 RLVR\uc5d0\uc11c \ud0d0\uc0c9\uacfc \ud65c\uc6a9\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ub3c4\ubaa8\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc2a4\ud478\ub9ac\uc5b4\uc2a4 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uacfc \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uac15\ud654\ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \uc815\ucc45 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c\uc640 \uc131\ub2a5\uc758 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2a4\ud478\ub9ac\uc5b4\uc2a4 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \ud074\ub9ac\ud551 \ubc14\uc774\uc5b4\uc2a4\uac00 \uc815\ucc45 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c\ub97c \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba70, \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc790\uc2e0\uac10 \uc788\uace0 \uacb0\uc815\uc801\uc778 \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc2a4\ud478\ub9ac\uc5b4\uc2a4 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc758 \uc774\uc810\uc744 \uba85\ud655\ud788 \ud558\uc5ec \ub354\uc6b1 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 RLVR \ud6c8\ub828 \uc6d0\uce59\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RLVR)\uc5d0\uc11c \ud0d0\uc0c9-\ud65c\uc6a9 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uba70, \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0 \ub530\ub974\uba74 RLVR\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc9c4\uc2e4\uacfc \uad00\ub828 \uc5c6\ub294 \uacb0\uacfc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ubcf4\uc0c1\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ud65c\uc6a9\uc744 \uc5b5\uc81c\ud558\ub294 \uc2a4\ud478\ub9ac\uc5b4\uc2a4 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uacfc \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc790\uc2e0\uc788\uace0 \uacb0\uc815\uc801\uc778 \ucd9c\ub825\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\ub3c4\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \uc5b5\uc81c\ud558\ub294 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ub77c\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc0c1\ubc18\ub41c \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 LLM\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc218\ud559\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc774\ub04c\uc5b4\ub0bc \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \ud654\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uae30\ubcf8 \uc6d0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc798 \uc774\ud574\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uae30\ubcf8 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucda5\ub2c8\ub2e4: (i) \uc815\ucc45 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c\uac00 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uad00\ub828\ub418\ub294\uac00, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 (ii) \uc2a4\ud478\ub9ac\uc5b4\uc2a4 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc774 \ud074\ub9ac\ud551 \ubc14\uc774\uc5b4\uc2a4\uc640 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc624\uc5fc\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\ub4dd\uc744 \uc8fc\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uac80\ud1a0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc2a4\ud478\ub9ac\uc5b4\uc2a4 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc544\ub798\uc5d0\uc11c \ud074\ub9ac\ud551 \ubc14\uc774\uc5b4\uc2a4\uac00 \uc815\ucc45 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c\ub97c \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ucf1c \ub354 \uc790\uc2e0\uac10 \uc788\uace0 \uacb0\uc815\uc801\uc778 \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \uc774\ub04c\uc5b4\ub0b4\uba70, \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \uac1c\uc120\uc774 \ucda9\ubd84\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub610\ud55c \uc2a4\ud478\ub9ac\uc5b4\uc2a4 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc774 \uc624\uc5fc\ub41c \uc124\uc815\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\uc5ec \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc124\uba85\ud558\ub294 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc1c\uacac\uc740 \uc2a4\ud478\ub9ac\uc5b4\uc2a4 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc758 \uc774\uc810 \ub4a4\uc5d0 \uc788\ub294 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uba85\ud655\ud788 \ud558\uace0, \ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 RLVR \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc6d0\uce59\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Existing environment-side solutions, such as blocking wrappers or frequent polling, either limit scalability or dilute the agent's context window with redundant observations. In this work, we propose an \\textbf{Agent-side Approach} that empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) to actively align their \\textit{Cognitive Timeline} with the physical world. By extending the Code-as-Action paradigm to the temporal domain, agents utilize semantic priors and In-Context Learning (ICL) to predict precise waiting durations (\\texttt{time.sleep(t)}), effectively synchronizing with asynchronous environment without exhaustive checking. Experiments in a simulated Kubernetes cluster demonstrate that agents can precisely calibrate their internal clocks to minimize both query overhead and execution latency, validating that temporal awareness is a learnable capability essential for autonomous evolution in open-ended environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ube44\ub3d9\uae30 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ub300\uae30 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uce21 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc138\uacc4\uc640 \uc778\uc9c0 \ud0c0\uc784\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \ub3d9\uae30\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2e4\uc81c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uc791\uc5c5\uc740 \ube44\ub3d9\uae30\uc131 \ud589\ub3d9\uacfc \uac00\ubcc0 \ub300\uae30 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ubbc0\ub85c, \ud589\ub3d9 \uc2dc\uc791\uacfc \uc644\ub8cc \uc0ac\uc774\uc5d0 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \uac04\uadf9\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud55c\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc740 \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ub9e5\ub77d \ucc3d\uc744 \ud76c\uc11d\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ucf54\ub4dc\ub97c \ud589\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uace0 \uc778\uc9c0 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ub300\uae30 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uce21 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ub41c Kubernetes \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ub0b4\ubd80 \uc2dc\uacc4\ub97c \uc815\ubc00\ud558\uac8c \uc870\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \ucffc\ub9ac \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc \ubc0f \uc2e4\ud589 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc744 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc2dc\uac04 \uc778\uc2dd\uc740 \uac1c\ubc29\ud615 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc9c4\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ubc30\uc6b8 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc73c\ub85c, \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc2e4\uc81c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uc791\uc5c5\uc740 \ub3d9\uae30 \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815(MDP)\uacfc\ub294 \ub2ec\ub9ac, \uac00\ubcc0 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \ube44\ucc28\ub2e8 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uc5ec \ud589\ub3d9 \uc2dc\uc791\uacfc \uc644\ub8cc \uac04\uc758 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4. \ucc28\ub2e8 \ub798\ud37c \ub610\ub294 \ube48\ubc88\ud55c \ud3f4\ub9c1\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uae30\uc874 \ud658\uacbd \uce21 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc740 \ud655\uc7a5\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ubd88\ud544\uc694\ud55c \uad00\ucc30\ub85c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ub9e5\ub77d \ucc3d\uc744 \uc57d\ud654\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc774 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc138\uacc4\uc640 \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \uc778\uc9c0 \ud0c0\uc784\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \uc801\uadf9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub9de\ucd9c \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uce21 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc2dc\uac04 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \uc120\ud5d8\uacfc \uc0c1\ud669 \ub0b4 \ud559\uc2b5(ICL)\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ub300\uae30 \uae30\uac04(\uc608: time.sleep(t))\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\uc5ec \ube44\ub3d9\uae30 \ud658\uacbd\uacfc \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub3d9\uae30\ud654\ub41c\ub2e4.

However, deployer-written policies in natural language are ambiguous and context dependent, so they map poorly to machine-checkable rules, and runtime enforcement is unreliable. Expressing safety policies as sequents, we propose \\textsc{QuadSentinel}, a four-agent guard (state tracker, policy verifier, threat watcher, and referee) that compiles these policies into machine-checkable rules built from predicates over observable state and enforces them online. Referee logic plus an efficient top-$k$ predicate updater keeps costs low by prioritizing checks and resolving conflicts hierarchically. Measured on ST-WebAgentBench (ICML CUA~'25) and AgentHarm (ICLR~'25), \\textsc{QuadSentinel} improves guardrail accuracy and rule recall while reducing false positives. Against single-agent baselines such as ShieldAgent (ICML~'25), it yields better overall safety control. Near-term deployments can adopt this pattern without modifying core agents by keeping policies separate and machine-checkable.

In long-horizon workflows, errors accumulate quickly and irreversible actions can cause unintended consequences, motivating critic models that assess each action before execution. While critic models offer a promising solution, their effectiveness is hindered by the lack of diverse, high-quality GUI feedback data and public critic benchmarks for step-level evaluation in computer use. To bridge these gaps, we introduce OS-Oracle that makes three core contributions: (1) a scalable data pipeline for synthesizing cross-platform GUI critic data; (2) a two-stage training paradigm combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and consistency-preserving group relative policy optimization (CP-GRPO); (3) OS-Critic Bench, a holistic benchmark for evaluating critic model performance across Mobile, Web, and Desktop platforms. Leveraging this framework, we curate a high-quality dataset containing 310k critic samples. The resulting critic model, OS-Oracle-7B, achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source VLMs on OS-Critic Bench, and surpasses proprietary models on the mobile domain. Furthermore, when serving as a pre-critic, OS-Oracle-7B improves the performance of native GUI agents such as UI-TARS-1.5-7B in OSWorld and AndroidWorld environments.

Although naturally complementary, these two information streams are highly heterogeneous in both paradigm and reasoning, making it difficult for existing methods to unify them or effectively model their cross-level interactions. To address this gap, we propose ForenAgent, a multi-round interactive IFD framework that enables MLLMs to autonomously generate, execute, and iteratively refine Python-based low-level tools around the detection objective, thereby achieving more flexible and interpretable forgery analysis. ForenAgent follows a two-stage training pipeline combining Cold Start and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning to enhance its tool interaction capability and reasoning adaptability progressively. Inspired by human reasoning, we design a dynamic reasoning loop comprising global perception, local focusing, iterative probing, and holistic adjudication, and instantiate it as both a data-sampling strategy and a task-aligned process reward. For systematic training and evaluation, we construct FABench, a heterogeneous, high-quality agent-forensics dataset comprising 100k images and approximately 200k agent-interaction question-answer pairs.

As these systems grow in capability and scope, adaptation becomes a central mechanism for improving performance, reliability, and generalization. In this paper, we unify the rapidly expanding research landscape into a systematic framework that spans both agent adaptations and tool adaptations. We further decompose these into tool-execution-signaled and agent-output-signaled forms of agent adaptation, as well as agent-agnostic and agent-supervised forms of tool adaptation. We demonstrate that this framework helps clarify the design space of adaptation strategies in agentic AI, makes their trade-offs explicit, and provides practical guidance for selecting or switching among strategies during system design. We then review the representative approaches in each category, analyze their strengths and limitations, and highlight key open challenges and future opportunities. Overall, this paper aims to offer a conceptual foundation and practical roadmap for researchers and practitioners seeking to build more capable, efficient, and reliable agentic AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc801\uc751 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uace0, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc801\uc751 \uc804\ub7b5\uc758 \uc124\uacc4 \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \uba85\ud655\ud788 \ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uc9c0\uce68\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5, \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131, \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc801\uc751 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131.", "method": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc801\uc751\uacfc \ub3c4\uad6c \uc801\uc751\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ub3c4\uad6c \uc2e4\ud589 \uc2e0\ud638 \ubc0f \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ucd9c\ub825 \uc2e0\ud638 \ud615\ud0dc\ub85c \ubd84\ud574.", "result": "\uc801\uc751 \uc804\ub7b5\uc758 \uc124\uacc4 \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \uba85\ud655\ud788 \ud558\uace0, \uc804\ub7b5 \uac04\uc758 \ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ub4dc \uc624\ud504\ub97c \uba85\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc124\uacc4 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc804\ub7b5 \uc120\ud0dd\uc774\ub098 \uc804\ud658\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801 \uc9c0\uce68\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub354 \ub2a5\ub825 \uc788\uace0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uba70 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\ub824\ub294 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc790 \ubc0f \uc2e4\ubb34\uc790\uc5d0\uac8c \uac1c\ub150\uc801 \uae30\ucd08\uc640 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \ub85c\ub4dc\ub9f5 \uae30\uc5ec.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud558\uace0 \ud2b9\uc218\ud654\ub41c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uacc4\ud68d\ud558\uace0, \ucd94\ub860\ud558\uba70, \uc678\ubd80 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc640 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc791\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc801\uc751\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uae30\ubcf8 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\ucd95\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825\uacfc \ubc94\uc704\uac00 \ud655\uc7a5\ub428\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc801\uc751\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5, \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \ubc0f \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc911\uc2ec \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774 \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uae09\uc18d\ud788 \ud655\uc7a5\ub418\ub294 \uc5f0\uad6c \ubd84\uc57c\ub97c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc801\uc751 \ubc0f \ub3c4\uad6c \uc801\uc751\uc744 \uc544\uc6b0\ub974\ub294 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c \ud1b5\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\ub97c \ub3c4\uad6c \uc2e4\ud589 \uc2e0\ud638 \ubc0f \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ucd9c\ub825 \uc2e0\ud638 \ud615\ud0dc\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc801\uc751\uc73c\ub85c, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ube44\uc885\uc18d\ud615 \ubc0f \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac10\ub3c5\ud615 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc801\uc751\uc73c\ub85c \ub354 \uc138\ubd84\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 AI\uc5d0\uc11c \uc801\uc751 \uc804\ub7b5\uc758 \uc124\uacc4 \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \uba85\ud655\ud788 \ud558\uace0, \uadf8\ub4e4 \uac04\uc758 \ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ub4dc\uc624\ud504\ub97c \uba85\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc124\uacc4 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc804\ub7b5 \uc120\ud0dd \ub610\ub294 \uc804\ud658\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801 \uc9c0\uce68\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc774 \ub428\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac01 \ubc94\uc8fc\uc5d0\uc11c \ub300\ud45c\uc801\uc778 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uac80\ud1a0\ud558\uace0, \uadf8 \uac15\uc810\uacfc \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uba70, \uc8fc\uc694 \uac1c\ubc29 \ubb38\uc81c\uc640 \ubbf8\ub798 \uae30\ud68c\ub97c \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc804\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub354 \ub2a5\ub825 \uc788\uace0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uba70 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud558\ub294 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc790 \ubc0f \uc2e4\ubb34\uc790\uc5d0\uac8c \uac1c\ub150\uc801 \uae30\ucd08\uc640 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \ub85c\ub4dc\ub9f5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Yet, after more than a decade of hype, its measurable impact remains modest outside a few high-profile scientific and commercial successes. The 2024 Nobel Prizes in Chemistry and Physics recognized AI's potential, but broader assessments indicate the impact to date is often more promotional than technical. We argue that while current AI may influence physics, physics has significantly more to offer this generation of AI. Current architectures - large language models, reasoning models, and agentic AI - can depend on trillions of meaningless parameters, suffer from distributional bias, lack uncertainty quantification, provide no mechanistic insights, and fail to capture even elementary scientific laws. We review critiques of these limits, highlight opportunities in quantum AI and analogue computing, and lay down a roadmap for the adoption of 'Big AI': a synthesis of theory-based rigour with the flexibility of machine learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5(AI)\uc740 \ubcc0\ud654\uc758 \uc6d0\ub3d9\ub825\uc73c\ub85c \uc5ec\uaca8\uc9c0\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud604\uc7ac\uae4c\uc9c0 \uadf8 \uc601\ud5a5\ub825\uc740 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 AI\uac00 \ubb3c\ub9ac\ud559\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc904 \uc218 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubb3c\ub9ac\ud559\uc774 AI \ubc1c\uc804\uc5d0 \ub354 \uae30\uc5ec\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4\uace0 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AI\uc758 \ubcc0\ud601\uc801\uc778 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uc778\uc2dd\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4, \uacfc\uac70 10\ub144\uac04\uc758 \uc131\uacfc\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uadf8 \uc601\ud5a5\ub825\uc774 \ubbf8\ubbf8\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc744 \uc9c0\uc801\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "AI\uc758 \ud604\uc7ac \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\uc640 \ube44\ud310\uc744 \uac80\ud1a0\ud558\uace0, \uc591\uc790 AI \ubc0f \uc544\ub0a0\ub85c\uadf8 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305\uc758 \uae30\ud68c\ub97c \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70, '\ube45 AI'\uc758 \ucc44\ud0dd\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub85c\ub4dc\ub9f5\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "AI \uae30\uc220\uc774 \ubb3c\ub9ac\ud559\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc5d0\uc11c AI\uac00 \ubb3c\ub9ac\ud559\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc5bb\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "AI\ub294 \ubb3c\ub9ac\ud559\uc758 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud568\uacfc \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc720\uc5f0\uc131\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ub354\uc6b1 \ubc1c\uc804\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5(AI)\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud601\uc2e0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud45c\ud604\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 10\ub144 \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uacfc\ub300 \uad11\uace0\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \uadf8 \uac00\uc2dc\uc801\uc778 \uc601\ud5a5\ub825\uc740 \uba87\uba87 \uace0\uae09 \uacfc\ud559 \ubc0f \uc0c1\uc5c5\uc801 \uc131\uacf5\uc744 \uc81c\uc678\ud558\uba74 \ubbf8\ubbf8\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. 2024\ub144 \ub178\ubca8 \ud654\ud559\uc0c1\uacfc \ubb3c\ub9ac\ud559\uc0c1\uc740 AI\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uc778\uc815\ud588\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc9c0\uae08\uae4c\uc9c0\uc758 \uc601\ud5a5\uc774 \uae30\uc220\uc801\uc774\ub77c\uae30\ubcf4\ub2e4\ub294 \uc8fc\ub85c \ud64d\ubcf4\uc801\uc784\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 AI\uac00 \ubb3c\ub9ac\ud559\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce60 \uc218 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubb3c\ub9ac\ud559\uc774 \uc774 \uc138\ub300\uc758 AI\uc5d0 \ud6e8\uc52c \ub354 \ub9ce\uc740 \uac83\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4\uace0 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud604\uc7ac \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc778 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378, \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub378 \ubc0f \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI\ub294 \uc218\uc870 \uac1c\uc758 \ubb34\uc758\ubbf8\ud55c \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ubd84\ud3ec \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \uacaa\uace0, \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uba70, \uae30\uacc4\uc801 \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc774 \uc5c6\uc5b4 \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uacfc\ud559 \ubc95\uce59\uc870\ucc28 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ube44\ud310\uc744 \uac80\ud1a0\ud558\uace0, \uc591\uc790 AI \ubc0f \uc544\ub0a0\ub85c\uadf8 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305\uc758 \uae30\ud68c\ub97c \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70, '\ube45 AI'\uc758 \ucc44\ud0dd\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub85c\ub4dc\ub9f5\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, imaginary opponents of MARL algorithms are practically configured and controlled in a fixed built-in AI mode, which causes less diversity and versatility in algorithm evaluation. To address this issue, in this work, we establish a multi-agent algorithm-vs-algorithm environment, named StarCraft II battle arena (SC2BA), to refresh the benchmarking of MARL algorithms in an adversary paradigm. Taking StarCraft as infrastructure, the SC2BA environment is specifically created for inter-algorithm adversary with the consideration of fairness, usability and customizability, and meantime an adversarial PyMARL (APyMARL) library is developed with easy-to-use interfaces/modules. Grounding in SC2BA, we benchmark those classic MARL algorithms in two types of adversarial modes: dual-algorithm paired adversary and multi-algorithm mixed adversary, where the former conducts the adversary of pairwise algorithms while the latter focuses on the adversary to multiple behaviors from a group of algorithms. The extensive benchmark experiments exhibit some thought-provoking observations/problems in the effectivity, sensibility and scalability of these completed algorithms.

While recent large language models (LLMs) combined with evolutionary algorithms show promise in automatic kernel optimization, existing approaches often fall short in performance due to their suboptimal agent designs and mismatched evolution representations. This work identifies these mismatches and proposes cuPilot, a strategy-coordinated multi-agent framework that introduces strategy as an intermediate semantic representation for kernel evolution. Key contributions include a strategy-coordinated evolution algorithm, roofline-guided prompting, and strategy-level population initialization. Experimental results show that the generated kernels by cuPilot achieve an average speed up of 3.09$\\times$ over PyTorch on a benchmark of 100 kernels.

Because of this combinatorial explosion, artists typically rely on extensive manual trial-and-error, leaving many potentially interesting configurations undiscovered. In this work we make two contributions.

The addition of memory further enhances them by enabling continuity across interactions, learning from past experiences, and improving the relevance of actions and responses over time; termed as memory-enhanced personalization. Although such personalization through memory offers clear benefits, it also introduces risks of bias. While several previous studies have highlighted bias in ML and LLMs, bias due to memory-enhanced personalized agents is largely unexplored. Using recruitment as an example use case, we simulate the behavior of a memory-enhanced personalized agent, and study whether and how bias is introduced and amplified in and across various stages of operation. Our experiments on agents using safety-trained LLMs reveal that bias is systematically introduced and reinforced through personalization, emphasizing the need for additional protective measures or agent guardrails in memory-enhanced LLM-based AI agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uac15\ud654 \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 LLM\uc774 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud558\uace0 \uac15\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\uc640 \uad00\ub828\ub41c \uc704\ud5d8\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uac15\ud654 \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub294 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc131\uacfc \ud589\ub3d9 \ubc0f \uc751\ub2f5\uc758 \uad00\ub828\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ub370 \uae30\uc5ec\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc758 \uc704\ud5d8\uc774 \uc874\uc7ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\ucc44\uc6a9 \uc0ac\ub840\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uac15\ud654 \uac1c\uc778\ud654 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud558\uace0 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc774 \ub3c4\uc785\ub418\uace0 \uac15\ud654\ub418\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud588\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc548\uc804 \uad50\uc721\uc774 \ub41c LLM\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574, \uac1c\uc778\ud654\uac00 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0 \uac15\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ud3b8\ud5a5\uc758 \uc704\ud5d8\uc131\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574 LLM \uae30\ubc18 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucd94\uac00\uc801\uc778 \ubcf4\ud638 \uc870\uce58\ub098 \uac00\ub4dc\ub808\uc77c\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \uc774\ud574, \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5 \uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uace0\uae09 \uae30\ub2a5\uc73c\ub85c AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uac15\ud654\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\ub97c \ucd94\uac00\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uac04\uc758 \uc5f0\uc18d\uc131\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uace0, \uacfc\uac70 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uba70, \uc2dc\uac04\uc774 \uc9c0\ub0a8\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ud589\ub3d9 \ubc0f \uc751\ub2f5\uc758 \uad00\ub828\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc774\ub97c \ub354\uc6b1 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uae30\ubc18 \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub77c\uace0 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub294 \ubd84\uba85\ud55c \uc774\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc758 \uc704\ud5d8\ub3c4 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc774\uc804 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 ML\uacfc LLM\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud588\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uac15\ud654 \uac1c\uc778\ud654 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \uc758\ud55c \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc740 \ud06c\uac8c \ud0d0\uad6c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ucc44\uc6a9\uc744 \uc608\uc81c \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uc0ac\ub840\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uac15\ud654 \uac1c\uc778\ud654 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud558\uace0, \ud3c9\uacfc\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc774 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ub3c4\uc785\ub418\uace0 \uc99d\ud3ed\ub418\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc548\uc804 \uad50\uc721\uc774 \ub41c LLM\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc740 \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc774 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub3c4\uc785\ub418\uace0 \uac15\ud654\ub41c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uac15\ud654 LLM \uae30\ubc18 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd94\uac00\uc801\uc778 \ubcf4\ud638 \uc870\uce58\ub098 \uac00\ub4dc\ub808\uc77c\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Existing benchmarks like BrowseComp and xBench-DeepSearch emphasize complex reasoning searches requiring multi-hop synthesis but neglect Fuzzy Exploratory Search, namely queries that are vague and multifaceted, where users seek the most relevant webpage rather than a single factual answer. To address this gap, we introduce Needle in the Web, a novel benchmark specifically designed to evaluate modern search agents and LLM-based systems on their ability to retrieve and reason over real-world web content in response to ambiguous, exploratory queries under varying levels of difficulty. Needle in the Web comprises 663 questions spanning seven distinct domains. To ensure high query quality and answer uniqueness, we employ a flexible methodology that reliably generates queries of controllable difficulty based on factual claims of web contents. We benchmark three leading LLMs and three agent-based search systems on Needle in the Web, finding that most models struggle: many achieve below 35% accuracy, and none consistently excel across domains or difficulty levels. These findings reveal that Needle in the Web presents a significant challenge for current search systems and highlights the open problem of effective fuzzy retrieval under semantic ambiguity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc6f9 \ucf58\ud150\uce20\ub97c \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\uace0 \ucd94\ub860\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uace0\uae09 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \ubc1c\uc804\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub294 \ubaa8\ud638\ud558\uace0 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc801 \ucffc\ub9ac\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac04\uacfc\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Needle in the Web\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubaa8\ud638\ud558\uace0 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc801\uc778 \ucffc\ub9ac\uc5d0\uc11c \ud604\ub300 \uac80\uc0c9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "Needle in the Web\uc740 663\uac1c\uc758 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc6f9 \ucf58\ud150\uce20\uc758 \uc0ac\uc2e4 \uc8fc\uc7a5\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uc870\uc808 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub09c\uc774\ub3c4\uc758 \ucffc\ub9ac\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc720\uc5f0\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 LLM\uacfc \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \uac80\uc0c9 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 35% \ubbf8\ub9cc\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ubcf4\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc5b4\ub5a4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub3c4 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 Needle in the Web\uc774 \ud604\uc7ac \uac80\uc0c9 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ud070 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ub418\uba70, \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \ubaa8\ud638\uc131 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ubaa8\ud638\ud55c \uac80\uc0c9\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc5f4\ub824 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc740 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \ucc57\ubd07\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc2e4\uc81c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc815\uad50\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \ubc1c\uc804\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5ec\uae30\uc11c \ub77c\uc774\ube0c \uc6f9 \ucf58\ud150\uce20\ub97c \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\uace0 \ucd94\ub860\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uac80\uc0c9 \ubc0f \uc778\uc9c0 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud575\uc2ec\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Utilizing the CRISP-DM methodology, the system processes a curated Islam QA dataset of 25,000 question-answer pairs from authentic sources like the Qur'an, Hadith, and scholarly fatwas, formatted in JSON for flexibility and scalability. The chatbot prototype, developed with a Flask API backend and Flutter-based mobile frontend, achieves 87% semantic accuracy in functional testing across diverse topics including fiqh, aqidah, ibadah, and muamalah, demonstrating its potential to enhance religious literacy, digital da'wah, and access to verified Islamic knowledge in the Industry 4.0 era.

We are witnessing the rise of a dangerous literacy gap, where a focus on the functional, operational skills of using AI tools is eclipsing the development of critical and ethical reasoning about them. This position paper argues for a systemic shift toward comprehensive AI literacy that centers human agency - the empowered capacity for intentional, critical, and responsible choice. This principle applies to all stakeholders in the educational ecosystem: it is the student's agency to question, create with, or consciously decide not to use AI based on the task; it is the teacher's agency to design learning experiences that align with instructional values, rather than ceding pedagogical control to a tool. True literacy involves teaching about agency itself, framing technology not as an inevitability to be adopted, but as a choice to be made. This requires a deep commitment to critical thinking and a robust understanding of epistemology. Through the AI Literacy, Fluency, and Competency frameworks described in this paper, educators and students will become agents in their own human-centric approaches to AI, providing necessary pathways to clearly articulate the intentions informing decisions and attitudes toward AI and the impact of these decisions on academic work, career, and society.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \uae30\uc220\uc758 \ube60\ub978 \ud1b5\ud569\uc774 \uad50\uc721\uc801 \ud544\uc5f0\uc131\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud588\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uad50\uc721 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc774\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc8fc\uccb4\uc131\uc5d0 \uc911\uc2ec\uc744 \ub454 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 AI \ubb38\ud574\ub825\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801 \uc804\ud658\uc744 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \uae30\uc220\uc758 \uae09\uc18d\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uad50\uc721 \uccb4\uacc4\uac00 \uadf8 \ud544\uc694\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucda9\uc871\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc5b4, \ubb38\ud574\ub825\uc758 \uaca9\ucc28\uac00 \uc0dd\uaca8\ub098\ub294 \uc0c1\ud669\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "AI \ubb38\ud574\ub825, \uc720\ucc3d\uc131 \ubc0f \uc5ed\ub7c9 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uad50\uc721\uc790\uc640 \ud559\uc0dd\ub4e4\uc774 AI\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc778\uac04 \uc911\uc2ec \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uad50\uc721\uc790\uc640 \ud559\uc0dd\ub4e4\uc740 \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucd98 AI \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 AI \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc758\uc2dd\uc801 \uc120\ud0dd\uc744 \ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ub41c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uad50\uc721 \ud604\uc7a5\uc5d0\uc11c AI\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacb0\uc815\uacfc \ud0dc\ub3c4\uc758 \uc758\ub3c4\ub97c \uba85\ud655\ud788 \ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "AI \ubb38\ud574\ub825\uc774 \uc9c4\uc815\ud55c \uad50\uc721\uc758 \uc77c\ud658\uc73c\ub85c \uc790\ub9ac \uc7a1\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \ube44\ud310\uc801 \uc0ac\uace0\uc640 \uc778\uc2dd\ub860\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uae4a\uc740 \uc774\ud574\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \uae30\uc220\uc774 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc758 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uba74\uc5d0 \ube60\ub974\uac8c \ud1b5\ud569\ub428\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uad50\uc721 \uccb4\uacc4\uac00 \uc774\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \ud070 \uad50\uc721\uc801 \ud544\uc5f0\uc131\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Evaluating Agentic Frameworks for Diagram-Grounded Geometry Problem Solving and Reasoning", "comment": "Accepted to the ARR October 2025 cycle", "summary": "Diagram-grounded geometry problem solving is a critical benchmark for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), yet the benefits of multi-agent design over single-agent remain unclear. We systematically compare single-agent and multi-agent pipelines on four visual math benchmarks: Geometry3K, MathVerse, OlympiadBench, and We-Math. For open-source models, multi-agent consistently improves performance. For example, Qwen-2.5-VL (7B) gains +6.8 points and Qwen-2.5-VL (32B) gains +3.3 on Geometry3K, and both Qwen-2.5-VL variants see further gains on OlympiadBench and We-Math. In contrast, the closed-source Gemini-2.0-Flash generally performs better in single-agent mode on classic benchmarks, while multi-agent yields only modest improvements on the newer We-Math dataset. These findings show that multi-agent pipelines provide clear benefits for open-source models and can assist strong proprietary systems on newer, less familiar benchmarks, but agentic decomposition is not universally optimal.

Workshop on Artificial Intelligence with and for Learning Sciences\", Cagliary, Italy, 10-12 December 2025", "summary": "Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is rapidly reshaping how knowledge is produced and validated in education. Rather than adding another digital tool, large language models reconfigure reading, writing, and coding into hybrid human-AI workflows, raising concerns about epistemic automation, cognitive offloading, and the de-professiona\\-lisation of teachers. This paper proposes \\emph{Cyber Humanism in Education} as a framework for reclaiming human agency in this landscape. We conceptualise AI-enabled learning environments as socio-technical infrastructures co-authored by humans and machines, and position educators and learners as epistemic agents and \\emph{algorithmic citizens} who have both the right and the responsibility to shape these infrastructures.\n  We articulate three pillars for cyber-humanist design, \\emph{reflexive competence}, \\emph{algorithmic citizenship}, and \\emph{dialogic design}, and relate them to major international digital and AI competence frameworks. We then present higher-education case studies that operationalise these ideas through \\emph{prompt-based learning} and a new \\emph{Conversational AI Educator} certification within the EPICT ecosystem. The findings show how such practices can strengthen epistemic agency while surfacing tensions around workload, equity, and governance, and outline implications for the future of AI-rich, human-centred education.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \uae30\uc220\uc774 \uad50\uc721\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc8fc\uccb4\uc131\uc744 \ubcf5\uc6d0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ud734\uba38\ub2c8\uc998\uc758 \ud2c0\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "Generative Artificial Intelligence\uac00 \uad50\uc721\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc0dd\uc0b0 \ubc0f \uac80\uc99d \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ubcc0\ud654\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uad50\uc721\uc790\uc758 \uc804\ubb38\uc131\uc774 \uc704\ud611\ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uc6b0\ub824\uac00 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc0ac\ub78c\uacfc \uae30\uacc4\uac00 \uacf5\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc800\uc791\ud55c \uc0ac\ud68c\uae30\uc220\uc801 \uc778\ud504\ub77c\ub85c AI \uae30\ubc18 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \uac1c\ub150\ud654\ud558\uace0, \uad50\uc721\uc790\uc640 \ud559\uc2b5\uc790\ub97c \uc778\uc2dd\ub860\uc801 \uc8fc\uccb4 \ubc0f \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \uc2dc\ubbfc\uc73c\ub85c\u5b9a\u4f4d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ud734\uba38\ub2c8\uc998 \ub514\uc790\uc778\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uae30\ub465\uc744 \uba85\uc2dc\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uace0\ub4f1 \uad50\uc721 \uc0ac\ub840 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc8fc\uccb4\uc131\uc744 \uac15\ud654\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba74\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uae34\uc7a5\uac10\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "AI \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \uc778\uac04 \uc911\uc2ec \uad50\uc721\uc758 \ubbf8\ub798\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2dc\uc0ac\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc0dd\uc131\uc801 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5(GenAI)\uc740 \uad50\uc721\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc0dd\uc0b0 \ubc0f \uac80\uc99d \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ube60\ub974\uac8c \ubcc0\ud654\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \ucd94\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \ub3c5\uc11c, \uc4f0\uae30, \ucf54\ub529\uc744 \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc778\uac04-\uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uc778\uc2dd\ub860\uc801 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654, \uc778\uc9c0\uc801 \uc624\ud504\ub85c\ub4dc, \uad50\uc0ac\uc758 \ube44\uc804\ubb38\uc9c1\ud654\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc6b0\ub824\ub97c \ubd88\ub7ec\uc77c\uc73c\ud0a4\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc8fc\uccb4\uc131\uc744 \ud68c\ubcf5\ud558\ub294 \ud2c0\ub85c\uc11c '\uad50\uc721\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ud734\uba38\ub2c8\uc998'\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, AI \uae30\ubc18 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \uc778\uac04\uacfc \uae30\uacc4\uac00 \uacf5\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc800\uc791\ud55c \uc0ac\ud68c\uae30\uc220\uc801 \uc778\ud504\ub77c\ub85c \uac1c\ub150\ud654\ud558\uba70, \uad50\uc721\uc790\uc640 \ud559\uc2b5\uc790\ub97c \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc778\ud504\ub77c\ub97c \ud615\uc131\ud560 \uad8c\ub9ac\uc640 \ucc45\uc784\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uc778\uc2dd\ub860\uc801 \uc8fc\uccb4 \ubc0f \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \uc2dc\ubbfc\uc73c\ub85c \uc704\uce58\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ud734\uba38\ub2c8\uc998 \ub514\uc790\uc778\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uae30\ub465\uc778 '\ubc18\uc131\uc801 \ub2a5\ub825', '\uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \uc2dc\ubbfc\uc131', '\ub300\ud654\uc801 \uc124\uacc4'\ub97c \uc124\uba85\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \uc8fc\uc694 \uad6d\uc81c \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \ubc0f AI \uc5ed\ub7c9 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc640 \uc5f0\uad00\uc9c0\uc5b4 \ub17c\uc758\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7f0 \ub2e4\uc74c \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc544\uc774\ub514\uc5b4\ub97c \uc2e4\ud604\ud558\ub294 \uace0\ub4f1 \uad50\uc721 \uc0ac\ub840 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c '\ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 \ud559\uc2b5'\uacfc EPICT \uc0dd\ud0dc\uacc4 \ub0b4\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 '\ub300\ud654\ud615 AI \uad50\uc721\uc790' \uc778\uc99d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc2e4\ucc9c\uc774 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc778\uc2dd\ub860\uc801 \uc8fc\uccb4\uc131\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uc5c5\ubb34\ub7c9, \ud615\ud3c9\uc131, \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4 \uad00\ub828 \uae34\uc7a5\uc774 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub098\uace0, AI\uac00 \ud48d\ubd80\ud558\uace0 \uc778\uac04 \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \uad50\uc721\uc758 \ubbf8\ub798\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2dc\uc0ac\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

The alternative AGI emergence hypothesis, where general capability levels are first manifested through coordination in groups of sub-AGI individual agents with complementary skills and affordances, has received far less attention. Here we argue that this patchwork AGI hypothesis needs to be given serious consideration, and should inform the development of corresponding safeguards and mitigations. The rapid deployment of advanced AI agents with tool-use capabilities and the ability to communicate and coordinate makes this an urgent safety consideration. We therefore propose a framework for distributional AGI safety that moves beyond evaluating and aligning individual agents. This framework centers on the design and implementation of virtual agentic sandbox economies (impermeable or semi-permeable), where agent-to-agent transactions are governed by robust market mechanisms, coupled with appropriate auditability, reputation management, and oversight to mitigate collective risks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\uc548\uc801\uc778 AGI \ucd9c\ud604 \uac00\uc124\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \uc548\uc804 \uc7a5\uce58 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 AI \uc548\uc804 \ubc0f \uc815\ub82c \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uac1c\ubcc4 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ubcf4\ud638 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ub2e8\uc77c AGI\uc758 \ucd9c\ud604\uc744 \uc804\uc81c\ub85c \ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uac00\uc0c1 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc0cc\ub4dc\ubc15\uc2a4 \uacbd\uc81c \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04 \uac70\ub798\ub97c \uc2dc\uc7a5 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc73c\ub85c \uad00\ub9ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc801 \uc704\ud5d8 \uc644\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uac10\uc0ac, \ud3c9\ud310 \uad00\ub9ac \ubc0f \uac10\ub3c5\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubc1c\uc804\ub41c AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ube60\ub978 \ubc30\uce58\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc548\uc804 \uace0\ub824 \uc0ac\ud56d\uc774 \uae34\uae09\ud574\uc84c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "AI \uc548\uc804 \ubc0f \uc815\ub82c \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc8fc\ub85c \uac1c\ubcc4 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uad81\uadf9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e8\uc77c\ud55c \uc778\uacf5 \uc77c\ubc18 \uc9c0\ub2a5(AGI)\uc758 \ucd9c\ud604\uc744 \uc804\uc81c\ub85c \ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ub2a5\ub825 \uc218\uc900\uc774 \ubcf4\uc644\uc801\uc778 \uae30\uc220 \ubc0f \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \ud558\uc704 AGI \uac1c\ubcc4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uadf8\ub8f9\uc758 \ud611\ub825\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uba3c\uc800 \ub098\ud0c0\ub098\ub294 \ub300\uc548\uc801 AGI \ucd9c\ud604 \uac00\uc124\uc740 \ud6e8\uc52c \ub35c \uc8fc\ubaa9\ubc1b\uc558\ub2e4. \uc5ec\uae30\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc870\ud654\ub85c\uc6b4 AGI \uac00\uc124\uc774 \uc2ec\uac01\ud558\uac8c \uace0\ub824\ub418\uc5b4\uc57c \ud558\uba70, \uc774\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \uc548\uc804 \uc7a5\uce58 \ubc0f \uc644\ud654\ucc45\uc758 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc5d0 \ubc18\uc601\ub418\uc5b4\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9 \ub2a5\ub825\uacfc \uc758\uc0ac \uc18c\ud1b5 \ubc0f \uc870\uc815 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \uace0\uae09 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ube60\ub978 \ubc30\uce58\ub294 \uc774\ub97c \uae34\uae09\ud55c \uc548\uc804 \uace0\ub824 \uc0ac\ud56d\uc73c\ub85c \ub9cc\ub4e0\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac1c\ubcc4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc0f \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \ub118\uc5b4\uc11c\ub294 \ubd84\uc0b0\ud615 AGI \uc548\uc804 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04 \uac70\ub798\uac00 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc2dc\uc7a5 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uad00\ub9ac\ub418\uace0, \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc801 \uc704\ud5d8 \uc644\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc801\uc808\ud55c \uac10\uc0ac \uac00\ub2a5\uc131, \ud3c9\ud310 \uad00\ub9ac \ubc0f \uac10\ub3c5\uc774 \uacb0\ud569\ub41c \uac00\uc0c1 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uacbd\uc81c \uc0cc\ub4dc\ubc15\uc2a4(\ubd88\uce68\ud22c\uc131 \ub610\ub294 \ubc18\ud22c\uacfc\uc131)\uc758 \ub514\uc790\uc778 \ubc0f \uad6c\ud604\uc5d0 \uc911\uc810\uc744 \ub454\ub2e4."}}
