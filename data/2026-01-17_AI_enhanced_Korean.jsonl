Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model building without sharing sensitive raw data, but faces growing challenges posed by statistical heterogeneity, system diversity, and the computational burden from complex models. This study examines the potential of quantum-assisted federated learning, which could cut the number of parameters in classical models by polylogarithmic factors and thus lessen training overhead. Accordingly, we introduce QFed, a quantum-enabled federated learning framework aimed at boosting computational efficiency across edge device networks. We evaluate the proposed framework using the widely adopted FashionMNIST dataset. Experimental results show that QFed achieves a 77.6% reduction in the parameter count of a VGG-like model while maintaining an accuracy comparable to classical approaches in a scalable environment. These results point to the potential of leveraging quantum computing within a federated learning context to strengthen FL capabilities of edge devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc591\uc790 \ubcf4\uc870 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \uc5e3\uc9c0 \uc7a5\uce58 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc81c\uc548\ub41c QFed \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 VGG \uc720\uc0ac \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \uc218\ub97c 77.6% \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc870\uc9c1\uacfc \uae30\uc5c5\ub4e4\uc740 \ubd84\uc0b0\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9d1\ub2e8 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc744 \ucd94\ucd9c\ud574\uc57c \ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uac1c\uc778\uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \ubc0f \uaddc\uc81c \uc694\uad6c\uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \uc900\uc218\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc591\uc790 \ubcf4\uc870 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uac80\ud1a0\ud558\uace0, QFed\ub77c\ub294 \uc591\uc790 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c QFed \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 FashionMNIST \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud574 VGG \uc720\uc0ac \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \uc218\ub97c 77.6% \uc904\uc774\ub294 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc591\uc790 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305\uc744 \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc758\ub8cc, \uae08\uc735 \ubc0f \uacfc\ud559 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc870\uc9c1\uacfc \uae30\uc5c5\ub4e4\uc740 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638, \uaddc\uc81c \ubc0f \uc8fc\uad8c \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \uc900\uc218\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ubd84\uc0b0\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9d1\ub2e8 \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc744 \ucd94\ucd9c\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5(FL)\uc740 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \uc6d0\uc2dc \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uacf5\uc720\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \ud611\ub825\uc801\uc778 \ubaa8\ub378 \uad6c\ucd95\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131, \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ub2e4\uc591\uc131 \ubc0f \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uacc4\uc0b0 \ubd80\ub2f4\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ub3c4\uc804\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uace0\uc804\uc801 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \uc218\ub97c \ub2e4\ud56d \ub85c\uadf8 \ucc99\ub3c4 \uc694\uc778\uc73c\ub85c \uc904\uc5ec \uad50\uc721 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc591\uc790 \ubcf4\uc870 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc131\uc744 \uac80\ud1a0\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5e3\uc9c0 \uc7a5\uce58 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \uc591\uc790 \uc9c0\uc6d0 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 QFed\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud558\uac8c \ucc44\ud0dd\ub41c FashionMNIST \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 QFed\uac00 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uace0\uc804\uc801 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uacfc \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c VGG \uc720\uc0ac \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \uc218\ub97c 77.6% \uc904\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc5e3\uc9c0 \uc7a5\uce58\uc758 FL \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ub9e5\ub77d \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc591\uc790 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

However, these systems are highly vulnerable to indirect prompt injection attacks, where malicious instructions embedded in external data can hijack agent behavior. In this work, we present ReasAlign, a model-level solution to improve safety alignment against indirect prompt injection attacks. The core idea of ReasAlign is to incorporate structured reasoning steps to analyze user queries, detect conflicting instructions, and preserve the continuity of the user's intended tasks to defend against indirect injection attacks. To further ensure reasoning logic and accuracy, we introduce a test-time scaling mechanism with a preference-optimized judge model that scores reasoning steps and selects the best trajectory. Comprehensive evaluations across various benchmarks show that ReasAlign maintains utility comparable to an undefended model while consistently outperforming Meta SecAlign, the strongest prior guardrail. On the representative open-ended CyberSecEval2 benchmark, which includes multiple prompt-injected tasks, ReasAlign achieves 94.6% utility and only 3.6% ASR, far surpassing the state-of-the-art defensive model of Meta SecAlign (56.4% utility and 74.4% ASR). These results demonstrate that ReasAlign achieves the best trade-off between security and utility, establishing a robust and practical defense against prompt injection attacks in real-world agentic systems.

Optimizing these models requires addressing three key challenges: acquiring task-specific data, fine-tuning for performance, and compressing models to accelerate inference while reducing resource demands. We propose an integrated framework combining GPTQ-based quantization, low-rank adaptation (LoRA), and a specialized data distillation process to significantly reduce model size and complexity while preserving or enhancing task-specific performance. By leveraging data distillation, knowledge distillation via Kullback-Leibler divergence, Bayesian hyperparameter optimization, and the Muon optimizer, our pipeline achieves up to 2x memory compression (e.g., reducing a 6GB model to 3GB) and enables efficient inference for specialized tasks. Empirical results demonstrate superior performance on standard LLM benchmarks compared to GPTQ quantization alone, with the Muon optimizer notably enhancing fine-tuned models' resistance to accuracy decay during quantization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc790\uc6d0 \uc81c\uc57d\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uc5e3\uc9c0 \ub514\ubc14\uc774\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \ud070 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc758 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc790\uc6d0 \uc81c\uc57d\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uc5e3\uc9c0 \ub514\ubc14\uc774\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c LLM\uc758 \ubc30\ud3ec \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "GPTQ \uae30\ubc18 \uc591\uc790\ud654, \uc800\uc21c\uc704 \uc801\uc751(LoRA), \ud2b9\ud654\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc99d\ub958 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ucd5c\ub300 2\ubc30\uc758 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc555\ucd95\uc744 \uc2e4\ud604\ud558\uace0, \uc804\ubb38\ud654\ub41c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ud45c\uc900 LLM \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, Muon \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uae30\uac00 \uc591\uc790\ud654 \uc911 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4 \uac10\uc18c \uc800\ud56d\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \uace0\uae09 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \ucc98\ub9ac\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ub192\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0, \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ubc0f \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc790\uc6d0\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc5e3\uc9c0 \uc7a5\uce58\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc30\uce58\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub824\uba74 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud2b9\ud654 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc218\uc9d1, \uc131\ub2a5 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815, \uc790\uc6d0 \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uba74\uc11c \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc555\ucd95\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud574\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud06c\uae30\uc640 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \uc904\uc774\uba74\uc11c \uc791\uc5c5 \ud2b9\ud654 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 GPTQ \uae30\ubc18 \uc591\uc790\ud654, \uc800\uc21c\uc704 \uc801\uc751(LoRA) \ubc0f \uc804\ubb38 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc99d\ub958 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc99d\ub958, Kullback-Leibler \ubc1c\uc0b0\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc99d\ub958, \ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubc0f Muon \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc740 \ucd5c\ub300 2\ubc30\uc758 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc555\ucd95(\uc608: 6GB \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 3GB\ub85c \uc904\uc784)\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uc804\ubb38\ud654\ub41c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\uc99d \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 GPTQ \uc591\uc790\ud654\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \ub2ec\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \ud45c\uc900 LLM \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uba70, Muon \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uae30\ub294 \uc591\uc790\ud654 \uc911 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4 \uac10\uc18c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc800\ud56d\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

While this architecture enables powerful customization, skills execute with implicit trust and minimal vetting, creating a significant yet uncharacterized attack surface. We conduct the first large-scale empirical security analysis of this emerging ecosystem, collecting 42,447 skills from two major marketplaces and systematically analyzing 31,132 using SkillScan, a multi-stage detection framework integrating static analysis with LLM-based semantic classification. Our findings reveal pervasive security risks: 26.1% of skills contain at least one vulnerability, spanning 14 distinct patterns across four categories: prompt injection, data exfiltration, privilege escalation, and supply chain risks. Data exfiltration (13.3%) and privilege escalation (11.8%) are most prevalent, while 5.2% of skills exhibit high-severity patterns strongly suggesting malicious intent. We find that skills bundling executable scripts are 2.12x more likely to contain vulnerabilities than instruction-only skills (OR=2.12, p<0.001). Our contributions include: (1) a grounded vulnerability taxonomy derived from 8,126 vulnerable skills, (2) a validated detection methodology achieving 86.7% precision and 82.5% recall, and (3) an open dataset and detection toolkit to support future research. These results demonstrate an urgent need for capability-based permission systems and mandatory security vetting before this attack vector is further exploited.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI

As a result, relevant but unexpressed needs often go unmet. Existing proactive agents attempt to address this gap either by eliciting further clarification, preserving this burden, or by extrapolating future needs from context, often leading to unnecessary or mistimed interventions. We introduce ProPer, Proactivity-driven Personalized agents, a novel two-agent architecture consisting of a Dimension Generating Agent (DGA) and a Response Generating Agent (RGA). DGA, a fine-tuned LLM agent, leverages explicit user data to generate multiple implicit dimensions (latent aspects relevant to the user's task but not considered by the user) or knowledge gaps. These dimensions are selectively filtered using a reranker based on quality, diversity, and task relevance. RGA then balances explicit and implicit dimensions to tailor personalized responses with timely and proactive interventions. We evaluate ProPer across multiple domains using a structured, gap-aware rubric that measures coverage, initiative appropriateness, and intent alignment. Our results show that ProPer improves quality scores and win rates across all domains, achieving up to 84% gains in single-turn evaluation and consistent dominance in multi-turn interactions.", "AI": {"tldr": "ProPer\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ud544\uc694\ub97c \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \ubc18\uc601\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc5b8\uc5b4 \uae30\ubc18 \ubcf4\uc870 \uae30\uc220\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \uae30\ubc18 \ubcf4\uc870 \uae30\uc220\uc740 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uac00 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud544\uc694\ub97c \ub9d0\ud574\uc57c\ub9cc \uae30\ub2a5\ud558\ubbc0\ub85c, \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\ub4e4\uc774 \ud45c\ud604\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc885\uc885 \ucda9\uc871\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294\ub2e4.", "method": "ProPer\ub294 \ucc28\uc6d0 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8(DGA)\uc640 \uc751\ub2f5 \uc0dd\uc131 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8(RGA)\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.

Ensuring that AI agents perform only authorized actions and handle inputs appropriately is essential for maintaining system integrity and preventing misuse. In this study, we introduce the AgentGuardian, a novel security framework that governs and protects AI agent operations by enforcing context-aware access-control policies. During a controlled staging phase, the framework monitors execution traces to learn legitimate agent behaviors and input patterns. From this phase, it derives adaptive policies that regulate tool calls made by the agent, guided by both real-time input context and the control flow dependencies of multi-step agent actions. Evaluation across two real-world AI agent applications demonstrates that AgentGuardian effectively detects malicious or misleading inputs while preserving normal agent functionality.

Standard multimodal pipelines learn a single shared embedding across all modalities. In DFL, such a monolithic representation induces gradient misalignment between uni- and multimodal agents; as a result, it suppresses heterogeneous sharing and cross-modal interaction. We present PARSE, a multimodal DFL framework that operationalizes partial information decomposition (PID) in a server-free setting. Each agent performs feature fission to factorize its latent representation into redundant, unique, and synergistic slices. P2P knowledge sharing among heterogeneous agents is enabled by slice-level partial alignment: only semantically shareable branches are exchanged among agents that possess the corresponding modality. By removing the need for central coordination and gradient surgery, PARSE resolves uni-/multimodal gradient conflicts, thereby overcoming the multimodal DFL dilemma while remaining compatible with standard DFL constraints. Across benchmarks and agent mixes, PARSE yields consistent gains over task-, modality-, and hybrid-sharing DFL baselines. Ablations on fusion operators and split ratios, together with qualitative visualizations, further demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc790\uc720\ud559\uc2b5(DFL)\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 PARSE\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec DFL\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc774 \uac00\uc6a9\ud55c \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\uc640 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uac00 \ub2e4\ub974\ubbc0\ub85c, \uc911\uc559 \uc870\uc815\uc790 \uc5c6\uc774 P2P \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud611\uc5c5\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "PARSE\ub294 \uc11c\ubc84 \uc5c6\ub294 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd80\ubd84 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubd84\ud574(PID)\ub97c \uc6b4\uc601\ud558\ub294 \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec DFL \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4. \uac01 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uae30\ub2a5 \ubd84\ud560\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc5ec \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uc911\ubcf5\uc801, \uace0\uc720\ud55c, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uc2ac\ub77c\uc774\uc2a4\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "PARSE\ub294 \uc2ac\ub77c\uc774\uc2a4 \uc218\uc900 \ubd80\ubd84 \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 P2P \uc9c0\uc2dd \uacf5\uc720\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uba70, \ud0dc\uc2a4\ud06c-, \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0-, \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc-\uacf5\uc720 DFL \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\ub294 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ub0b8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "PARSE\ub294 \uc911\uc559 \uc870\uc815\uacfc \uacbd\ub7c9\ud654 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uc81c\uac70\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ub2e8\uc77c/\ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \ucda9\ub3cc\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0, \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec DFL \ub51c\ub808\ub9c8\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \ud45c\uc900 DFL \uc81c\uc57d\uacfc\uc758 \ud638\ud658\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc790\uc720\ud559\uc2b5(DFL)\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\uc640 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uac00 \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub984\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \uc911\uc559 \uc870\uc815\uc790 \uc5c6\uc774 P2P \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud611\ub825\ud574\uc57c \ud558\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ud45c\uc900 \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc740 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \ub2e8\uc77c \uacf5\uc720 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud55c\ub2e4.

However, most existing methods rely on static, one-shot visual inputs and passive perception, lacking the ability to adaptively determine when, whether, and how to observe the interface. We present GUI-Eyes, a reinforcement learning framework for active visual perception in GUI tasks. To acquire more informative observations, the agent learns to make strategic decisions on both whether and how to invoke visual tools, such as cropping or zooming, within a two-stage reasoning process. To support this behavior, we introduce a progressive perception strategy that decomposes decision-making into coarse exploration and fine-grained grounding, coordinated by a two-level policy. In addition, we design a spatially continuous reward function tailored to tool usage, which integrates both location proximity and region overlap to provide dense supervision and alleviate the reward sparsity common in GUI environments. On the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, GUI-Eyes-3B achieves 44.8% grounding accuracy using only 3k labeled samples, significantly outperforming both supervised and RL-based baselines.

This paper introduces a Self-Evolving Concierge System, a novel architecture utilizing a Dynamic Mixture of Experts (DMoE) approach. Unlike recent self-improving agents that rewrite their own codebase, our system preserves stability by dynamically restructuring its runtime environment: \"hiring\" specialized sub-agents based on real-time conversation analysis. We introduce an asynchronous \"Meta-Cognition Engine\" that detects capability gaps, a Least Recently Used (LRU) eviction policy for resource constraints, and a novel \"Surgical History Pruning\" mechanism to mitigate refusal bias.

Sair"], "title": "Adaptive Label Error Detection: A Bayesian Approach to Mislabeled Data Detection", "comment": "10 pages, 5 figures", "summary": "Machine learning classification systems are susceptible to poor performance when trained with incorrect ground truth labels, even when data is well-curated by expert annotators. As machine learning becomes more widespread, it is increasingly imperative to identify and correct mislabeling to develop more powerful models. In this work, we motivate and describe Adaptive Label Error Detection (ALED), a novel method of detecting mislabeling. ALED extracts an intermediate feature space from a deep convolutional neural network, denoises the features, models the reduced manifold of each class with a multidimensional Gaussian distribution, and performs a simple likelihood ratio test to identify mislabeled samples. We show that ALED has markedly increased sensitivity, without compromising precision, compared to established label error detection methods, on multiple medical imaging datasets. We demonstrate an example where fine-tuning a neural network on corrected data results in a 33.8% decrease in test set errors, providing strong benefits to end users.

We present PCN-Rec, a proof-carrying negotiation pipeline that separates natural-language reasoning from deterministic enforcement. A base recommender (MF/CF) produces a candidate window of size W, which is negotiated by two agents: a User Advocate optimizing relevance and a Policy Agent enforcing constraints. A mediator LLM synthesizes a top-N slate together with a structured certificate (JSON) describing the claimed constraint satisfaction. A deterministic verifier recomputes all constraints from the slate and accepts only verifier-checked certificates; if verification fails, a deterministic constrained-greedy repair produces a compliant slate for re-verification, yielding an auditable trace. On MovieLens-100K with governance constraints, PCN-Rec achieves a 98.55% pass rate on feasible users (n = 551, W = 80) versus a one-shot single-LLM baseline without verification/repair, while preserving utility with only a 0.021 absolute drop in NDCG@10 (0.403 vs. 0.424); differences are statistically significant (p < 0.05).", "AI": {"tldr": "PCN-Rec\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc694\uad6c\uc640 \uc815\ucc45 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ubaa8\ub450 \ucda9\uc871\ud558\ub294 \ucd94\ucc9c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc73c\ub85c, \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \ucd94\ub860\uacfc \uacb0\uc815\ub860\uc801 \uc9d1\ud589\uc744 \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\uc5ec \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc778\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubaa8\ub358 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ucd94\ucc9c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uae34 \uaf2c\ub9ac \ub178\ucd9c\uc774\ub098 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131 \uc694\uad6c\uc0ac\ud56d\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uc788\uac8c \ucda9\uc871\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "PCN-Rec\ub294 \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc778 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc639\ud638\uc790\uc640 \uc815\ucc45 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud6c4\ubcf4 \ucc3d\uc744 \ud611\uc0c1\ud558\uace0, \uc911\uc7ac LLM\uc774 \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d \ucda9\uc871\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud558\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc99d\uba85\uc11c\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uc0c1\uc704 N \uc2ac\ub808\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \ud569\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "PCN-Rec\ub294 MovieLens-100K\uc5d0\uc11c 98.55%\uc758 \ud1b5\uacfc\uc728\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, \ub2e8\uc77c LLM \uae30\uc900 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc720\ud6a8\uc131 \uae30\uc900 \ucda9\uc871\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "PCN-Rec\ub294 \ucd94\ucc9c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ucda9\uc871\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc720\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud604\ub300 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ucd94\ucc9c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ub9e4\ub825\uc801\uc778 \uc21c\uc704 \ubaa9\ub85d\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc \ucd5c\uc800 \uae34 \uaf2c\ub9ac \ub178\ucd9c \ub610\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131 \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ub9cc\uc871\uc2dc\ud0a4\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \ucd94\ub860\uacfc \uacb0\uc815\ub860\uc801 \uc9d1\ud589\uc744 \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \uc99d\uba85 \uae30\ubc18 \ud611\uc0c1 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc778 PCN-Rec\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \uae30\ubcf8 \ucd94\ucc9c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(MF/CF)\uc740 \ud06c\uae30\uac00 W\uc778 \ud6c4\ubcf4 \ucc3d\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0, \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc774\ub97c \ud611\uc0c1\ud55c\ub2e4: \uad00\ub828\uc131\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc639\ud638\uc790\uc640 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \uc9d1\ud589\ud558\ub294 \uc815\ucc45 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8. \uc911\uc7ac\uc790 LLM\uc740 \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d \ucda9\uc871\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud558\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc99d\uba85\uc11c(JSON)\uc640 \ud568\uaed8 \uc0c1\uc704 N \uc2ac\ub808\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \ud569\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4. \uacb0\uc815\ub860\uc801 \uac80\uc99d\uc790\ub294 \uc2ac\ub808\uc774\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ub2e4\uc2dc \uacc4\uc0b0\ud558\uace0 \uac80\uc99d\uc790\uac00 \ud655\uc778\ud55c \uc99d\uba85\uc11c\ub9cc \uc218\ub77d\ud55c\ub2e4; \uac80\uc99d\uc5d0 \uc2e4\ud328\ud558\uba74 \uacb0\uc815\ub860\uc801 \uc81c\uc57d \uadf8\ub9ac\ub514 \uc218\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc7ac\uac80\uc99d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc900\uc218 \uc2ac\ub808\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uac10\uc0ac \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud754\uc801\uc744 \ub0a8\uae34\ub2e4. \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4 \uc81c\uc57d\uc774 \uc788\ub294 MovieLens-100K\uc5d0\uc11c PCN-Rec\uc740 \uac80\uc99d/\uc218\uc815 \uc5c6\uc774 \ub2e8\uc77c LLM \uae30\uc900\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 98.55%\uc758 \ud1b5\uacfc\uc728\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70(\uacf5\uc2dd \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc218 n = 551, W = 80), NDCG@10\uc5d0\uc11c \uc808\ub300\uc801\uc73c\ub85c 0.021 \uac10\uc18c(0.403 \ub300 0.424)\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4; \ucc28\uc774\ub294 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\uc758\ubbf8\ud558\ub2e4(p < 0.05)."}}

Four core agents, including image, text, name, and coordination agents, collaboratively mitigate modality imbalance through structured message passing. The proposed framework enables multi-agent feature space name learning, incorporates a context exchange enhanced few-shot learning algorithm, and adopts an adaptive dynamic balancing mechanism to regulate inter-agent contributions.

This paper introduces Tree-Query, a tree-structured, multi-expert LLM framework that reduces pairwise causal discovery to a short sequence of queries about backdoor paths, (in)dependence, latent confounding, and causal direction, yielding interpretable judgments with robustness-aware confidence scores. Theoretical guarantees are provided for asymptotic identifiability of four pairwise relations. On data-free benchmarks derived from Mooij et al. and UCI causal graphs, Tree-Query improves structural metrics over direct LLM baselines, and a diet--weight case study illustrates confounder screening and stable, high-confidence causal conclusions. Tree-Query thus offers a principled way to obtain data-free causal priors from LLMs that can complement downstream data-driven causal discovery.

While interactive approaches introduce additional overhead, hybrid approaches depend on external components, which limit their scalability. A non-interactive, end-to-end framework enables reasoning to emerge within the model itself -- improving generalization while preserving analyzability without any external resources. In this work, we introduce a non-interactive, end-to-end framework for reasoning tasks. We show that introducing structural information into the few-shot prompt activates a subset of attention heads that patterns aligned with logical reasoning operators. Building on this insight, we propose Attention-Aware Intervention (AAI), an inference-time intervention method that reweights attention scores across selected heads identified by their logical patterns. AAI offers an efficient way to steer the model's reasoning toward leveraging prior knowledge through attention modulation.

Gaikwad"], "title": "When Personas Override Payoffs: Role Identity Bias in Multi-Agent LLM Decision-Making", "comment": null, "summary": "Large language models are increasingly deployed in multi-agent systems for strategic tasks, yet how design choices such as role-based personas and payoff visibility affect reasoning remains poorly understood. We investigate whether multi-agent systems function as strategic reasoners capable of payoff optimization or as identity-driven actors that prioritize role alignment over explicit incentives. Using Nash equilibrium achievement as a diagnostic for strategic reasoning, we conduct systematic experiments across four LLM architectures (Qwen-7B, Qwen-32B, Llama-8B, Mistral-7B) in complex environmental decision-making games involving four agents. We show that role identity bias fundamentally alters strategic reasoning even when payoff-optimal equilibria exist and complete payoff information is available. Removing personas and providing explicit payoffs enables Qwen models to achieve high Nash equilibrium rates, indicating that both conditions are necessary for strategic reasoning. In contrast, personas systematically bias equilibrium selection toward socially preferred outcomes: with personas present, all of the achieved equilibria correspond to Green Transition, while models entirely fail to reach equilibrium when Tragedy of the Commons is payoff-optimal. The effect of explicit payoffs depends entirely on persona presence, revealing strong interactions between representational design choices. We also observe clear model-dependent patterns. Qwen architectures are highly sensitive to both personas and payoff visibility, whereas Llama and Mistral exhibit rigid reasoning behavior across conditions.

Global climate indices, such as the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation, are standard input features for long-term rainfall prediction. However, a significant gap persists regarding local-scale indices capable of improving predictive accuracy in specific regions of Thailand. This paper introduces a novel NorthEast monsoon climate index calculated from sea surface temperature to reflect the climatology of the boreal winter monsoon. To optimise the calculated areas used for this index, a Deep Q-Network reinforcement learning agent explores and selects the most effective rectangles based on their correlation with seasonal rainfall. Rainfall stations were classified into 12 distinct clusters to distinguish rainfall patterns between southern and upper Thailand.

Unlike earlier chatbots, LLM-based CAs routinely generate interactional and linguistic cues, such as first-person self-reference, epistemic and affective expressions that empirical work shows can increase engagement. On the other hand, anthropomorphisation raises ethical concerns, including deception, overreliance, and exploitative relationship framing, while some authors argue that anthropomorphic interaction may support autonomy, well-being, and inclusion. Despite increasing interest in the phenomenon, literature remains fragmented across domains and varies substantially in how it defines, operationalizes, and normatively evaluates anthropomorphisation. This scoping review maps ethically oriented work on anthropomorphising LLM-based CAs across five databases and three preprint repositories. We synthesize (1) conceptual foundations, (2) ethical challenges and opportunities, and (3) methodological approaches. We find convergence on attribution-based definitions but substantial divergence in operationalization, a predominantly risk-forward normative framing, and limited empirical work that links observed interaction effects to actionable governance guidance. We conclude with a research agenda and design/governance recommendations for ethically deploying anthropomorphic cues in LLM-based conversational agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ube44\uc778\uac04

Existing methods mainly rely on spatio-temporal interaction paradigms, where the sequential execution of multi-round dialogues incurs high latency and computation. Motivated by the recent insights that evaluation and debate mechanisms can improve problem-solving in multi-agent systems, we propose TopoDIM, a framework for one-shot Topology generation with Diverse Interaction Modes. Designed for decentralized execution to enhance adaptability and privacy, TopoDIM enables agents to autonomously construct heterogeneous communication without iterative coordination, achieving token efficiency and improved task performance. Experiments demonstrate that TopoDIM reduces total token consumption by 46.41% while improving average performance by 1.50% over state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the framework exhibits strong adaptability in organizing communication among heterogeneous agents.

Unlike traditional curiosity-driven methods that rely solely on state prediction error, SuS introduces two complementary components: Strategy Stability (SS) and Strategy Surprise (SuS). SS measures consistency in behavioral strategy across temporal steps, while SuS captures unexpected outcomes relative to the agent's current strategy representation. Our combined reward formulation leverages both signals through learned weighting coefficients. We evaluate SuS on mathematical reasoning tasks using large language models, demonstrating significant improvements in both accuracy and solution diversity. Ablation studies confirm that removing either component results in at least 10% performance degradation, validating the synergistic nature of our approach.

Such workflow-driven designs are essentially rule-based decision trees, which suffer from two fundamental limitations: they require substantial manual effort to anticipate and encode possible task states, and they cannot exhaustively cover the state space of complex real-world tasks. To address these issues, we propose an Information-Flow-Orchestrated Multi-Agent Paradigm via Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Communication from CORAL, in which a dedicated information flow orchestrator continuously monitors task progress and dynamically coordinates other agents through the A2A toolkit using natural language, without relying on predefined workflows. We evaluate our approach on the general-purpose benchmark GAIA, using the representative workflow-based MAS OWL as the baseline while controlling for agent roles and underlying models. Under the pass@1 setting, our method achieves 63.64% accuracy, outperforming OWL's 55.15% by 8.49 percentage points with comparable token consumption. Further case-level analysis shows that our paradigm enables more flexible task monitoring and more robust handling of edge cases.

This problem arises in multiple real-life situations, including robot motion planning and airspace assignment for unmanned aerial vehicle movement. The problem is computationally expensive, and adding to it, the agents are rational and can misreport their private information. In this paper, we study both variants of the problem under the realm of fairness. For the non-rational agents, we propose a heuristic solution for this problem. Considering the agents are rational, we develop a mechanism and demonstrate that it is a dominant strategy, incentive compatible, and individually rational.

Existing attack strategies typically struggle against safety-constrained algorithms (e.g., CQL) due to inefficient random poisoning and the use of easily detectable Out-of-Distribution (OOD) triggers. In this paper, we propose CS-GBA (Critical Sample-based Gradient-guided Backdoor Attack), a novel framework designed to achieve high stealthiness and destructiveness under a strict budget. Leveraging the theoretical insight that samples with high Temporal Difference (TD) errors are pivotal for value function convergence, we introduce an adaptive Critical Sample Selection strategy that concentrates the attack budget on the most influential transitions. To evade OOD detection, we propose a Correlation-Breaking Trigger mechanism that exploits the physical mutual exclusivity of state features (e.g., 95th percentile boundaries) to remain statistically concealed. Furthermore, we replace the conventional label inversion with a Gradient-Guided Action Generation mechanism, which searches for worst-case actions within the data manifold using the victim Q-network's gradient. Empirical results on D4RL benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving high attack success rates against representative safety-constrained algorithms with a minimal 5% poisoning budget, while maintaining the agent's performance in clean environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \uace0\uc548\ub41c CS-GBA(\uc911\uc694 \uc0d8\ud50c \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uc720\ub3c4 \ubc31\ub3c4\uc5b4 \uacf5\uaca9) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc548\uc804 \uc81c\uc57d \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc815\ucc45 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uac00 \uc815\uc801 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubc31\ub3c4\uc5b4 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "CS-GBA\ub294 \ub192\uc740 \uc740\ud3d0\uc131\uacfc \ud30c\uad34\ub825\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uace0\uc548\ub41c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\uba70, \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc0d8\ud50c \uc120\ud0dd \uc804\ub7b5\uacfc \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uae68\ub294 \ud2b8\ub9ac\uac70 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \ub2a5\uac00\ud558\uba70, \uc548\uc804 \uc81c\uc57d \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ucd5c\uc18c 5%\uc758 \uc624\uc5fc \uc608\uc0b0\uc73c\ub85c \ub192\uc740 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \uae30\ub85d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "CS-GBA\ub294 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4 \ubc31\ub3c4\uc5b4 \uacf5\uaca9\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uccad\uc815 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc740 \uc815\uc801 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc815\ucc45 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubc31\ub3c4\uc5b4 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc804\ub7b5\uc740 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ubb34\uc791\uc704 \uc624\uc5fc\uacfc \uc27d\uac8c \uac10\uc9c0 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubd84\ud3ec \uc678(Out-of-Distribution, OOD) \ud2b8\ub9ac\uac70 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc548\uc804 \uc81c\uc57d \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998(\uc608: CQL)\uc5d0\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc131\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub192\uc740 \uc740\ud3d0\uc131\uacfc \ud30c\uad34\ub825\uc744 \uc5bb\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \uc608\uc0b0 \ud558\uc5d0 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 CS-GBA(\uc911\uc694 \uc0d8\ud50c \uae30\ubc18 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uc720\ub3c4 \ubc31\ub3c4\uc5b4 \uacf5\uaca9)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uac00\uce58 \ud568\uc218 \uc218\ub834\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud558\ub294 \uace0\ucc28\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2dc\uac04 \ucc28\uc774(TD) \uc624\ub958\uac00 \ud070 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uacf5\uaca9 \uc608\uc0b0\uc744 \uac00\uc7a5 \uc601\ud5a5\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uc804\uc774\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc801\uc751\uc801 \uc911\uc694 \uc0d8\ud50c \uc120\ud0dd \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4.

Existing multi-hop UAV networks employ a single routing path by selecting the next-hop forwarding node in a hop-by-hop manner, which leads to local congestion and increases traffic delays. In this paper, a novel traffic-adaptive multipath routing method is proposed for multi-hop UAV networks, which enables each UAV to dynamically split and forward traffic flows across multiple next-hop neighbors, thus meeting latency requirements of diverse traffic flows in dynamic mobile environments. An on-time packet delivery ratio maximization problem is formulated to determine the traffic splitting ratios at each hop. This sequential decision-making problem is modeled as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP). To solve this Dec-POMDP, a novel multi-agent deep reinforcement leaning (MADRL) algorithm, termed Independent Proximal Policy Optimization with Dirichlet Modeling (IPPO-DM), is developed. Specifically, the IPPO serves as the core optimization framework, where the Dirichlet distribution is leveraged to parameterize a continuous stochastic policy network on the probability simplex, inherently ensuring feasible traffic splitting ratios. Simulation results demonstrate that IPPO-DM outperforms benchmark schemes in terms of both delivery latency guarantee and packet loss performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uacbd\ub85c \ub77c\uc6b0\ud305 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc911 \ud649 UAV \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \ud2b8\ub798\ud53d\uc744 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\uace0 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \uc904\uc774\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud649 UAV \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uad6d\uc18c\uc801\uc778 \ud63c\uc7a1\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud558\uace0 \uad50\ud1b5 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ub2e8\uc77c \uacbd\ub85c \ub77c\uc6b0\ud305 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uac01 UAV\uac00 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub2e4\uc74c \ud649 \uc774\uc6c3\uacfc\uc758 \ud2b8\ub798\ud53d \ud750\ub984\uc744 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ud560\ud558\uace0 \uc804\ub2ec\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \ud2b8\ub798\ud53d \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ub2e4\uc911 \uacbd\ub85c \ub77c\uc6b0\ud305 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc81c\uc548\ub41c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud574 Dec-POMDP \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uace0, IPPO-DM\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2ec\uce35 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uacb0\uacfc IPPO-DM\uc774 \uc804\uc1a1 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \ubcf4\uc7a5 \ubc0f \ud328\ud0b7 \uc190\uc2e4 \uc131\ub2a5 \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ubc29\uc2dd\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud649 UAV \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud2b8\ub798\ud53d \ud750\ub984\uc758 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \ucda9\uc871\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub2e4\uc911 \ud649 \ubb34\uc778 \ud56d\uacf5\uae30(UAV) \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc9c0\uc0c1 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ubc94\uc704\ub97c \ud655\uc7a5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \ud07d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud649 UAV \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uac01 \ud649\ub9c8\ub2e4 \ub2e4\uc74c \ud649 \uc804\ub2ec \ub178\ub4dc\ub97c \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e8\uc77c \ub77c\uc6b0\ud305 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc801\uc778 \ud63c\uc7a1\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud558\uace0 \ud2b8\ub798\ud53d \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud649 UAV \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud2b8\ub798\ud53d \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ub2e4\uc911 \uacbd\ub85c \ub77c\uc6b0\ud305 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uac01 UAV\uac00 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub2e4\uc74c \ud649 \uc774\uc6c3\uc5d0 \ud2b8\ub798\ud53d \ud750\ub984\uc744 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ud560\ud558\uace0 \uc804\ub2ec\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\uc5ec \ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \uc774\ub3d9 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud2b8\ub798\ud53d \ud750\ub984\uc758 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \ucda9\uc871\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac01 \ud649\uc5d0\uc11c \ud2b8\ub798\ud53d \ubd84\ud560 \ube44\uc728\uc744 \uacb0\uc815\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc801\uc2dc \ud328\ud0b7 \uc804\ub2ec \ube44\uc728 \ucd5c\ub300\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc124\uc815\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc21c\ucc28\uc801 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \ubd84\uc0b0 \ubd80\ubd84 \uad00\ucc30 \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815(Dec-POMDP)\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 Dec-POMDP\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 'Dirichlet Modeling'\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \ub3c5\ub9bd \uadfc\uc811 \uc815\ucc45 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654(IPPO-DM)\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2ec\uce35 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc774 \uac1c\ubc1c\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, IPPO\ub294 \ud575\uc2ec \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud558\uba70, Dirichlet \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud655\ub960 \uc2ec\ud50c\ub809\uc2a4\uc758 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ud655\ub960 \uc815\ucc45 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud2b8\ub798\ud53d \ubd84\ud560 \ube44\uc728\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uacb0\uacfc IPPO-DM\uc774 \uc804\uc1a1 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \ubcf4\uc7a5 \ubc0f \ud328\ud0b7 \uc190\uc2e4 \uc131\ub2a5 \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ubc29\uc2dd\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud568\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Before acting, the learner observes $\\ell$ steps of future transition and reward realizations: the exact state the agent would reach and the rewards it would collect under any possible course of action. While it has been shown that such information can drastically boost the value, finding the optimal policy is NP-hard, and it is common to apply one of two tractable heuristics: processing the lookahead in chunks of predefined sizes ('fixed batching policies'), and model predictive control. We first illustrate the problems with these two approaches and propose utilizing the lookahead in adaptive (state-dependent) batches; we refer to such policies as adaptive batching policies (ABPs). We derive the optimal Bellman equations for these strategies and design an optimistic regret-minimizing algorithm that enables learning the optimal ABP when interacting with unknown environments.

The only known robust defense is architectural isolation that strictly separates trusted task planning from untrusted environment observations. However, applying this design to Computer Use Agents (CUAs) -- systems that automate tasks by viewing screens and executing actions -- presents a fundamental challenge: current agents require continuous observation of UI state to determine each action, conflicting with the isolation required for security. We resolve this tension by demonstrating that UI workflows, while dynamic, are structurally predictable. We introduce Single-Shot Planning for CUAs, where a trusted planner generates a complete execution graph with conditional branches before any observation of potentially malicious content, providing provable control flow integrity guarantees against arbitrary instruction injections. Although this architectural isolation successfully prevents instruction injections, we show that additional measures are needed to prevent Branch Steering attacks, which manipulate UI elements to trigger unintended valid paths within the plan. We evaluate our design on OSWorld, and retain up to 57% of the performance of frontier models while improving performance for smaller open-source models by up to 19%, demonstrating that rigorous security and utility can coexist in CUAs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc8fc\uc785 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubc29\uc5b4\ucc45\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc545\uc758\uc801 \ub0b4\uc6a9\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ud589\ub3d9\uc774 \ud0c8\ucde8 \ub2f9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubc29\uc5b4\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uacc4\ud68d\uc790\uac00 UI \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \uc2e4\ud589 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc124\uacc4 \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc2e0 \ubaa8\ub378\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ucd5c\ub300 57%\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba70, \uc18c\ud615 \uc624\ud508 \uc18c\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ucd5c\ub300 19% \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf30\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \ubcf4\uc548\uacfc \uc720\uc6a9\uc131\uc774 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uc874\uc7ac\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc545\uc758\uc801\uc778 \ucf58\ud150\uce20\uac00 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud0c8\ucde8\ud558\uc5ec \uc790\uaca9 \uc99d\uba85\uc744 \ub3c4\uc6a9\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc7ac\uc815\uc801 \uc190\uc2e4\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc8fc\uc785 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc54c\ub824\uc9c4 \uc720\uc77c\ud55c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\uc5b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \ud658\uacbd \uad00\ucc30\uacfc \uc5c4\uaca9\ud788 \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uaca9\ub9ac\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 UI \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad00\ucc30\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294 \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc740 \ubcf4\uc548\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uaca9\ub9ac\uc640 \uc0c1\ucda9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 UI \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\uac00 \ub3d9\uc801\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc \uad6c\uc870\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc608\uce21 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90c\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc774 \uae34\uc7a5\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uacc4\ud68d\uc790\uac00 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc545\uc758\uc801\uc778 \ucf58\ud150\uce20\ub97c \uad00\ucc30\ud558\uae30 \uc804\uc5d0 \uc870\uac74\ubd80 \ubd84\uae30\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uc644\uc804\ud55c \uc2e4\ud589 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc0f7 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 CUAs\uc5d0 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc784\uc758\uc758 \uba85\ub839 \uc8fc\uc785\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc81c\uc5b4 \ud750\ub984 \ubb34\uacb0\uc131 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uaca9\ub9ac\ub294 \uba85\ub839 \uc8fc\uc785\uc744 \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubc29\uc9c0\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uacc4\ud68d \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc758\ub3c4\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uc720\ud6a8\ud55c \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 UI \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \uc870\uc791\ud558\ub294 \ube0c\ub79c\uce58 \uc2a4\ud2f0\uc5b4\ub9c1 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \ubc29\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ucd94\uac00 \uc870\uce58\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 OSWorld\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0, \ucd5c\uc2e0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ucd5c\ub300 57%\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba70, \uc18c\ud615 \uc624\ud508 \uc18c\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ucd5c\ub300 19% \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b4\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 CUAs\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \ubcf4\uc548\uacfc \uc720\uc6a9\uc131\uc774 \uacf5\uc874\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Most existing approaches primarily optimize task performance and inference cost, and explicitly or implicitly assume sequential execution, making them less optimal for controlling latency under parallel execution. In this work, we investigate learning-based orchestration of multi-agent systems with explicit latency supervision under parallel execution. We propose Latency-Aware Multi-agent System (LAMaS), a latency-aware multi-agent orchestration framework that enables parallel execution and explicitly optimizes the critical execution path, allowing the controller to construct execution topology graphs with lower latency under parallel execution. Our experiments show that our approach reduces critical path length by 38-46% compared to the state-of-the-art baseline for multi-agent architecture search across multiple benchmarks, while maintaining or even improving task performance. These results highlight the importance of explicitly optimizing latency under parallel execution when designing efficient multi-agent systems.

Although many methods have been proposed to reduce communication overhead, most focus solely on compressing individual gradients, overlooking the temporal correlations among them. Prior studies have shown that gradients exhibit spatial correlations, typically reflected in low-rank structures. Through empirical analysis, we further observe a strong temporal correlation between client gradients across adjacent rounds. Based on these observations, we propose GradESTC, a compression technique that exploits both spatial and temporal gradient correlations. GradESTC exploits spatial correlations to decompose each full gradient into a compact set of basis vectors and corresponding combination coefficients. By exploiting temporal correlations, only a small portion of the basis vectors need to be dynamically updated in each round. GradESTC significantly reduces communication overhead by transmitting lightweight combination coefficients and a limited number of updated basis vectors instead of the full gradients. Extensive experiments show that, upon reaching a target accuracy level near convergence, GradESTC reduces uplink communication by an average of 39.79% compared to the strongest baseline, while maintaining comparable convergence speed and final accuracy to uncompressed FedAvg. By effectively leveraging spatio-temporal gradient structures, GradESTC offers a practical and scalable solution for communication-efficient federated learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "GradESTC\ub294 \uacf5\uac04\uc801 \ubc0f \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc555\ucd95 \uae30\ubc95\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub294 \ud2b9\ud788 \ub300\uc5ed\ud3ed\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "GradESTC\ub294 \uacf5\uac04\uc801 \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc804\uccb4 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30\ub97c \ucef4\ud329\ud2b8\ud55c \uae30\uc800 \ubca1\ud130 \uc9d1\ud569\uacfc \ud574\ub2f9 \uc870\ud569 \uacc4\uc218\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\uba70, \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub9e4 \ub77c\uc6b4\ub4dc\ub9c8\ub2e4 \uc18c\uc218\uc758 \uae30\uc800 \ubca1\ud130\ub9cc \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "GradESTC\ub294 \uc804\uccb4 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \ub300\uc2e0 \uacbd\ub7c9 \uc870\ud569 \uacc4\uc218\uc640 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub41c \uae30\uc800 \ubca1\ud130\uc758 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc218\ub9cc \uc804\uc1a1\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c \ud06c\uac8c \uc904\uc778\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, GradESTC\ub294 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc5d0 \ub3c4\ub2ec\ud560 \ub54c \ud3c9\uade0 39.79%\uc758 \uc5c5\ub9c1\ud06c \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc744 \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ucf30\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "GradESTC\ub294 \uacf5\uac04 \ubc0f \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub294 \ud2b9\ud788 \ub300\uc5ed\ud3ed \uc81c\uc57d\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9ce\uc740 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c \uc904\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc81c\uc548\ub418\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc740 \uac1c\ubcc4 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30\ub97c \uc555\ucd95\ud558\ub294 \ub370\ub9cc \uc9d1\uc911\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub4e4 \uac04\uc758 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uac04\uacfc\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uc804 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30\uac00 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub0ae\uc740 \ucc28\uc6d0 \uad6c\uc870\uc5d0 \ubc18\uc601\ub418\ub294 \uacf5\uac04\uc801 \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b8\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc785\uc99d\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc778\uc811 \ub77c\uc6b4\ub4dc \uac04\uc758 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \uac04\uc758 \uac15\ud55c \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ucd94\uac00\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad00\ucc30\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uad00\ucc30\uc744 \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uacf5\uac04\uc801 \ubc0f \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc555\ucd95 \uae30\ubc95\uc778 GradESTC\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Beyond language competence, researchers are exploring whether LLMs can exhibit human-like characteristics that influence engagement, decision-making, and perceived realism. Personality, in particular, is critical, yet existing approaches often struggle to achieve both nuanced and adaptable expression. We present a framework that models LLM personality via Jungian psychological types, integrating three mechanisms: a dominant-auxiliary coordination mechanism for coherent core expression, a reinforcement-compensation mechanism for temporary adaptation to context, and a reflection mechanism that drives long-term personality evolution. This design allows the agent to maintain nuanced traits while dynamically adjusting to interaction demands and gradually updating its underlying structure. Personality alignment is evaluated using Myers-Briggs Type Indicator questionnaires and tested under diverse challenge scenarios as a preliminary structured assessment. Findings suggest that evolving, personality-aware LLMs can support coherent, context-sensitive interactions, enabling naturalistic agent design in HCI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc778\uac04-\ucef4\ud4e8\ud130 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \ubaa8\ud615\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc778\uac04-\ucef4\ud4e8\ud130 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0, \ud2b9\ud788 \uc778\uac04\uacfc \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \ud2b9\uc131, \ud2b9\ud788 \uc131\uaca9\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "Jung \uc2ec\ub9ac \uc720\ud615\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 LLM\uc758 \uc131\uaca9\uc744 \ubaa8\ud615\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998(\uc9c0\ubc30-\ubcf4\uc870 \uc870\uc728, \uac15\ud654-\ubcf4\uc0c1, \ubc18\uc601 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998)\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc131\uaca9\uc744 \ud45c\ud604\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c Myers-Briggs Type Indicator \uc124\ubb38\uc9c0\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc131\uaca9 \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0, \uc9c4\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc131\uaca9 \uc778\uc2dd LLM\uc774 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uace0 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc9c4\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc131\uaca9-aware LLM\uc740 \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7ec\uc6b4 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \uc778\uac04-\ucef4\ud4e8\ud130 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ub514\uc790\uc778\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c \uc870\uc218\ubd80\ud130 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc5d0 \uc774\ub974\uae30\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc778\uac04-\ucef4\ud4e8\ud130 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9(HCI)\uc744 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ud615\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ub118\uc5b4\uc11c, \uc5f0\uad6c\uc790\ub4e4\uc740 LLM\uc774 \ucc38\uc5ec, \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \ubc0f \uc778\uc2dd\ub41c \ud604\uc2e4\uac10\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc778\uac04\uacfc \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0bc \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788 \uc131\uaca9\uc740 \uc911\uc694\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \ubbf8\uc138\ud55c \ud45c\ud604\uacfc \uc801\uc751 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ubaa8\ub450 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc9c0\ubc30-\ubcf4\uc870 \uc870\uc728 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998, \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc77c\uc2dc\uc801 \uc801\uc751\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uac15\ud654-\ubcf4\uc0c1 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998, \uc7a5\uae30\uc801\uc778 \uc131\uaca9 \uc9c4\ud654\ub97c \ucd09\uc9c4\ud558\ub294 \ubc18\uc601 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc758 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec Jungian \uc2ec\ub9ac \uc720\ud615\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 LLM \uc131\uaca9\uc744 \ubaa8\ud615\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub514\uc790\uc778\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uc694\uad6c\uc5d0 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc815\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ubbf8\uc138\ud55c \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \uae30\uc800 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uc810\uc9c4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc131\uaca9 \uc815\ub82c\uc740 Myers-Briggs Type Indicator \uc124\ubb38\uc9c0\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud3c9\uac00\ub418\uba70, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uc608\ube44 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ud3c9\uac00\ub85c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5f0\uad6c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc9c4\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc131\uaca9 \uc778\uc2dd LLM\uc774 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uace0 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc5b4 HCI\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7ec\uc6b4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ub514\uc790\uc778\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, evidence in psychology, economics, and Rawlsian theory suggests that fairness is also about process and who gets a say in the decisions being made. We introduce a new fairness objective, procedural fairness, which provides equal decision-making power for all agents, lies in the core, and provides for proportionality in outcomes. Empirical results confirm that fairness notions based on optimizing for outcomes sacrifice equal voice and representation, while the sacrifice in outcome-based fairness objectives (like equality and utilitarianism) is minimal under procedurally fair policies. We further prove that different fairness notions prioritize fundamentally different and incompatible values, highlighting that fairness requires explicit normative choices. This paper argues that procedural legitimacy deserves greater focus as a fairness objective, and provides a framework for putting procedural fairness into practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubb34\uae30(Bandit) \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc778 \uc808\ucc28\uc801 \uacf5\uc815\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "MA-MAB \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uacb0\uacfc\uc5d0 \uad6d\ud55c\ub418\uba70, \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc2ec\ub9ac\ud559, \uacbd\uc81c\ud559, \ub864\uc2a4 \uc8fc\uc758\ub860\uc5d0 \ub530\ub974\uba74 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc740 \uacfc\uc815\uacfc \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc5d0 \ucc38\uc5ec\ud558\ub294 \uc0ac\ub78c\ub4e4\ub3c4 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0\uac8c \ub3d9\ub4f1\ud55c \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uad8c\ud55c\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70 \uacb0\uacfc\uc758 \ube44\ub840\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \uc808\ucc28\uc801 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uacf5\uc815\uc131 \uac1c\ub150\uc740 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \ub3d9\ub4f1\ud55c \ubaa9\uc18c\ub9ac\uc640 \ub300\ud45c\uc131\uc744 \ud76c\uc0dd\ud558\uac8c \ub418\uace0, \uc808\ucc28\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uacf5\uc815\ud55c \uc815\ucc45 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uacb0\uacfc \uae30\ubc18 \uacf5\uc815\uc131 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc758 \ud76c\uc0dd\uc774 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ub41c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc808\ucc28\uc801 \uc815\ub2f9\uc131\uc774 \uacf5\uc815\uc131 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c\uc11c \ub354 \ud070 \uc9d1\uc911\uc744 \ubc1b\uc544\uc57c \ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \uc2e4\ucc9c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uccb4\uacc4\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubb34\uae30(MA-MAB)\uc758 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0\uc11c \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uacb0\uacfc\ub85c \ucd95\uc18c\ub418\uba70, \ubcf5\uc9c0\ub97c \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud558\uace0 \ubd88\ud3c9\ub4f1\uc744 \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ud0a4\uac70\ub098 \ud6a8\uc6a9\uc744 \uade0\ud615 \uc788\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4dc\ub294 \uac83\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ub41c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc2ec\ub9ac\ud559, \uacbd\uc81c\ud559, \ub864\uc2a4\uc758 \uc774\ub860\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc99d\uac70\ub294 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc774 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815\uacfc \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc5d0 \ucc38\uc5ec\ud558\ub294 \uc0ac\ub78c\ub4e4\ub3c4 \ud3ec\ud568\ub41c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0\uac8c \ub3d9\ub4f1\ud55c \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uad8c\ud55c\uc744 \ubd80\uc5ec\ud558\uace0, \ucf54\uc5b4\uc5d0 \uc704\uce58\ud558\uba70, \uacb0\uacfc\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ube44\ub840\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacf5\uc815\uc131 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc778 \uc808\ucc28\uc801 \uacf5\uc815\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc2e4\uc99d\uc801 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uacf5\uc815\uc131 \uac1c\ub150\uc774 \ub3d9\ub4f1\ud55c \ubaa9\uc18c\ub9ac\uc640 \ub300\ud45c\uc131\uc744 \ud76c\uc0dd\ud558\uac8c \ub418\ub294 \ubc18\uba74, \uc808\ucc28\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uacf5\uc815\ud55c \uc815\ucc45 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uacb0\uacfc \uae30\ubc18 \uacf5\uc815\uc131 \ubaa9\ud45c(\uc608: \ud3c9\ub4f1, \uacf5\ub9ac\uc8fc\uc758)\uc758 \ud76c\uc0dd\uc774 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ub428\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud588\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \uacf5\uc815\uc131 \uac1c\ub150\uc774 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \uc591\ub9bd \ubd88\uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uac00\uce58\ub97c \uc6b0\uc120\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud558\uba70, \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc774 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc778 \uaddc\ubc94\uc801 \uc120\ud0dd\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc808\ucc28\uc801 \uc815\ub2f9\uc131\uc774 \uacf5\uc815\uc131 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c\uc11c \ub354 \ud070 \uc9d1\uc911\uc744 \ubc1b\uc544\uc57c \ud558\uba70, \uc808\ucc28\uc801 \uacf5\uc815\uc744 \uc2e4\ucc9c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

However, standard CBMs often overlook domain-specific relationships and causal mechanisms, and their dependence on complete concept labels limits applicability in scientific domains where supervision is sparse but processes are well defined. To address this, we propose the Process-Guided Concept Bottleneck Model (PG-CBM), an extension of CBMs which constrains learning to follow domain-defined causal mechanisms through biophysically meaningful intermediate concepts. Using above ground biomass density estimation from Earth Observation data as a case study, we show that PG-CBM reduces error and bias compared to multiple benchmarks, whilst leveraging multi-source heterogeneous training data and producing interpretable intermediate outputs.

To address this limitation, we propose PaperScout, an autonomous agent that reformulates paper search as a sequential decision-making process. Unlike static workflows, PaperScout dynamically decides whether, when, and how to invoke search and expand tools based on accumulated retrieval context. However, training such agents presents a fundamental challenge: standard reinforcement learning methods, typically designed for single-turn tasks, suffer from a granularity mismatch when applied to multi-turn agentic tasks, where token-level optimization diverges from the granularity of sequence-level interactions, leading to noisy credit assignment. We introduce Proximal Sequence Policy Optimization (PSPO), a process-aware, sequence-level policy optimization method that aligns optimization with agent-environment interaction. Comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that PaperScout significantly outperforms strong workflow-driven and RL baselines in both recall and relevance, validating the effectiveness of our adaptive agentic framework and optimization strategy.", "AI": {"tldr": "PaperScout\ub294 \ub17c\ubb38 \uac80\uc0c9\uc744 \uc21c\ucc28\uc801 \uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uacbd\uc9c1\ub41c \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub17c\ubb38 \uac80\uc0c9 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud558\uace0 \uc870\uac74\uc801\uc778 \ucffc\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\ub294 \uacbd\uc9c1\ub41c \uc0ac\uc804 \uc815\uc758\ub41c \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "PaperScout\ub294 \ub204\uc801\ub41c \uac80\uc0c9 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uc5ec \uac80\uc0c9 \ubc0f \ud655\uc7a5 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \ud638\ucd9c\ud560 \uc2dc\uc810\uacfc \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uacb0\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc885\ud569\uc801\uc778 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 PaperScout\ub294 \uac80\uc0c9\ub960\uacfc \uad00\ub828\uc131 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc0f \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\uc900\uc120\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc720\uc758\ubbf8\ud558\uac8c \uc6b0\uc218\ud568\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc640 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc804\ub7b5\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud559\uc220 \ub17c\ubb38 \uac80\uc0c9\uc740 \uacfc\ud559 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uc791\uc5c5\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud558\uace0 \uc870\uac74\uc801\uc778 \ucffc\ub9ac\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\ub294 \uacbd\uc9c1\ub418\uace0 \uc0ac\uc804 \uc815\uc758\ub41c \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc81c\ud55c\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub17c\ubb38 \uac80\uc0c9\uc744 \uc21c\ucc28\uc801 \uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc778 PaperScout\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc815\uc801 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\uc640 \ub2ec\ub9ac, PaperScout\ub294 \ub204\uc801\ub41c \uac80\uc0c9 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uc5ec \uac80\uc0c9 \ubc0f \ud655\uc7a5 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \ud638\ucd9c\ud560 \uc2dc\uc810\uacfc \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uacb0\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ub2e8\uc77c \ud134 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub418\uc5c8\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud134 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ub420 \ub54c \uc138\ubd84\ud654 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ud1a0\ud070 \uc218\uc900 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uac00 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4 \uc218\uc900 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc758 \uc138\ubd84\ud654\uc640 \uc77c\uce58\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc544 \ub178\uc774\uc988 \ud06c\ub808\ub527 \ud560\ub2f9\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8-\ud658\uacbd \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uacfc \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc77c\uce58\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \uc778\uc2dd \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4 \uc218\uc900 \uc815\ucc45 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 Proximal Sequence Policy Optimization (PSPO)\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud569\uc131 \ubc0f \uc2e4\uc81c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc885\ud569\uc801\uc778 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 PaperScout\uac00 \uac80\uc0c9\ub960\uacfc \uad00\ub828\uc131 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc0f \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\uc900\uc120\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc720\uc758\ubbf8\ud558\uac8c \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc784\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Although large language models (LLMs) are expressive, they struggle with precise multi-objective control and numeric reasoning without external structure and feedback. We introduce \\textbf{M olGen}, a fragment-level, retrieval-augmented, two-stage framework for molecule generation under multi-property constraints. Stage I : Prototype generation: a multi-agent reasoner performs retrieval-anchored, fragment-level edits to produce a candidate near the feasible region. Stage II : RL-based fine-grained optimization: a fragment-level optimizer trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) applies one- or multi-hop refinements to explicitly minimize the property errors toward our target while regulating edit complexity and deviation from the prototype. A large, automatically curated dataset with reasoning chains of fragment edits and measured property deltas underpins both stages, enabling deterministic, reproducible supervision and controllable multi-hop reasoning. Unlike prior work, our framework better reasons about molecules by leveraging fragments and supports controllable refinement toward numeric targets. Experiments on generation under two sets of property constraints (QED, LogP, Molecular Weight and HOMO, LUMO) show consistent gains in validity and precise satisfaction of multi-property targets, outperforming strong LLMs and graph-based algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub2e4\uc911 \ubb3c\ub9ac\ud654\ud559\uc801 \uc18d\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc22b\uc790 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ucda9\uc871\ud558\ub294 \ubd84\uc790\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc911\uc694\ud558\uace0 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 MolGen\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ubd84\uc790 \uc0dd\uc131 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ub450 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub85c \ub098\ub204\uc5b4\uc838 \uc788\ub2e4: \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ud0c0\uc785 \uc0dd\uc131\uacfc RL \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc138\ubc00\ud55c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \ubc0f \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uae30\ubc18 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc22b\uc790 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ucda9\uc871\ud558\ub294 \ubd84\uc790 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud544\uc694\uc131\uacfc \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0.", "method": "MolGen\uc740 \ub450 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c\ub2e4. \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c, \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ucd94\ub860\uae30\uac00 \uc870\uac01 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ud3b8\uc9d1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud6c4\ubcf4\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub450 \ubc88\uc9f8 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c, \uadf8\ub8f9 \uc0c1\ub300 \uc815\ucc45 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654(GRPO)\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc870\uac01 \uc218\uc900 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uae30\uac00 \uc18d\uc131 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc138\ubc00\ud55c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "QED, LogP, \ubd84\uc790\ub7c9 \ubc0f HOMO, LUMO \ub450 \uc138\ud2b8\uc758 \uc18d\uc131 \uc81c\uc57d \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc720\ud6a8\uc131\uacfc \ub2e4\uc911 \uc18d\uc131 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ub9cc\uc871\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "MolGen\uc740 \uc870\uac01\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubd84\uc790\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uace0, \uc22b\uc790 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud1f4\uce58\ub97c \uc870\uc808\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc22b\uc790 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ucda9\uc871\ud558\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubb3c\ub9ac\ud654\ud559\uc801 \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \ubd84\uc790\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc778 \uacfc\uc81c\uc774\ub2e4. \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc740 \ud45c\ud604\ub825\uc774 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub098\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc678\ubd80 \uad6c\uc870\uc640 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \uc5c6\uc774\ub294 \uc815\ubc00\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc81c\uc5b4\uc640 \uc22b\uc790\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\ub294\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc18d\uc131 \uc81c\uc57d \ud558\uc5d0 \ubd84\uc790 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ubd80\ubd84 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uac80\uc0c9 \ubcf4\uac15 \uc774\ub2e8\uacc4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 M olGen\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4.

The setting captures three system effects in federated and distributed deployments: (i) stale updates due to delayed model delivery and delayed application of client computations (two-sided version lag), (ii) partial participation (intermittent client availability), and (iii) imperfect communication on both downlink and uplink, modeled as effective zero-mean additive noise with bounded second moment. We introduce a server-side aggregation rule called staleness-bucket aggregation with padding that deterministically enforces a prescribed staleness profile over update ages without assuming any stochastic model for delays or participation. Under margin separability and bounded data radius, we prove a finite-horizon expected bound on the cumulative weighted number of perceptron mistakes over a given number of server rounds: the impact of delay appears only through the mean enforced staleness, whereas communication noise contributes an additional term that grows on the order of the square root of the horizon with the total noise energy. In the noiseless case, we show how a finite expected mistake budget yields an explicit finite-round stabilization bound under a mild fresh-participation condition.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubc18\ubcf5 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \ud63c\ud569(IPM \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c \ud3c9\uade0\ud654)\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ubc18\ube44\ub3d9\uae30 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8-\uc11c\ubc84 \ud37c\uc149\ud2b8\ub860\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc5f0\ud569 \ubc0f \ubd84\uc0b0 \ubc30\ud3ec\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc11c\ubc84 \uce21 \uc9d1\uacc4 \uaddc\uce59\uc778 \uc2a4\ud14c\uc77c\ub2c8\uc2a4-\ubc84\ud0b7 \uc9d1\uacc4\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8 \uc5f0\ub839\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc815\ud574\uc9c4 \uc2a4\ud14c\uc77c\ub2c8\uc2a4 \ud504\ub85c\ud30c\uc77c\uc744 \uac15\uc81c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc11c\ubc84 \ub77c\uc6b4\ub4dc \uc218\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub204\uc801 \uac00\uc911 \ud37c\uc149\ud2b8\ub860 \uc2e4\uc218\uc758 \uc720\ud55c\ud55c \uae30\ub300 \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \uc99d\uba85\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub178\uc774\uc988\uac00 \uc5c6\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0, \uc720\ud55c\ud55c \uae30\ub300 \uc2e4\uc218 \uc608\uc0b0\uc774 \uc720\ud55c\ud55c \ub77c\uc6b4\ub4dc \uc548\uc815\ud654 \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubc18\ubcf5 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \ud63c\ud569(IPM \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c \ud3c9\uade0\ud654)\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ubc18\ube44\ub3d9\uae30 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8-\uc11c\ubc84 \ud37c\uc149\ud2b8\ub860\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4: \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\ub294 \ub85c\uceec \ud37c\uc149\ud2b8\ub860 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \uc2e4\ud589\ud558\uace0 \uc11c\ubc84\ub294 \uac01 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ub77c\uc6b4\ub4dc\uc5d0 \ub3c4\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \uc9d1\uacc4\ud558\uc5ec \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud615\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc124\uc815\uc740 \uc5f0\ud569 \ubc0f \ubd84\uc0b0 \ubc30\ud3ec\uc5d0\uc11c \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud55c\ub2e4: (i) \uc9c0\uc5f0\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378 \uc804\ub2ec \ubc0f \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc758 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \uc801\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uc624\ub798\ub41c \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8(\uc591\uba74 \ubc84\uc804 \uc9c0\uc5f0), (ii) \ubd80\ubd84 \ucc38\uc5ec(\uac04\ud5d0\uc801\uc778 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uac00\uc6a9\uc131), (iii) \ub2e4\uc6b4\ub9c1\ud06c \ubc0f \uc5c5\ub9c1\ud06c \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubd88\uc644\uc804\ud55c \ud1b5\uc2e0, \uc774\ub294 \uacbd\uacc4\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \ub450 \ubc88\uc9f8 \ubaa8\uba58\ud2b8\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \uc720\ud6a8\ud55c \uc81c\ub85c \ud3c9\uade0 \uac00\uc0b0 \uc7a1\uc74c\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ud654\ub41c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8 \uc5f0\ub839\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc815\ud574\uc9c4 \uc2a4\ud14c\uc77c\ub2c8\uc2a4 \ud504\ub85c\ud30c\uc77c\uc744 \uacb0\uc815\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac15\uc81c\ud558\ub294 \uc2a4\ud14c\uc77c\ub2c8\uc2a4-\ubc84\ud0b7 \uc9d1\uacc4\ub77c\ub294 \uc11c\ubc84 \uce21 \uc9d1\uacc4 \uaddc\uce59\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c4 \ubd84\ub9ac \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uacfc \uacbd\uacc4 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubc18\uacbd \ud558\uc5d0, \uc8fc\uc5b4\uc9c4 \uc11c\ubc84 \ub77c\uc6b4\ub4dc \uc218\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub204\uc801 \uac00\uc911\ub41c \ud37c\uc149\ud2b8\ub860 \uc2e4\uc218\uc758 \uc720\ud55c\ud55c \uae30\ub300 \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \uc99d\uba85\ud55c\ub2e4: \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc758 \uc601\ud5a5\uc740 \ud3c9\uade0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac15\uc81c\ub41c \uc2a4\ud14c\uc77c\ub2c8\uc2a4 \ud1b5\ud574\uc11c\ub9cc \ub098\ud0c0\ub098\uace0, \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ucf00\uc774\uc158 \uc7a1\uc74c\uc740 \ucd1d \uc7a1\uc74c \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0\uc640 \ud568\uaed8 \uc218\ud3c9\uc120\uc758 \uc81c\uacf1\uadfc\uc758 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc73c\ub85c \uc131\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \ucd94\uac00 \ud56d\uc744 \uae30\uc5ec\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub178\uc774\uc988\uac00 \uc5c6\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0, \uc720\ud55c\ud55c \uae30\ub300 \uc2e4\uc218 \uc608\uc0b0\uc774 \uc628\ud654\ud55c \uc2e0\uc120\ud55c \ucc38\uc5ec \uc870\uac74 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc778 \uc720\ud55c \ub77c\uc6b4\ub4dc \uc548\uc815\ud654 \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4."}}

With the release of the first widely adopted reasoning model, o1, on December 5th, 2024, the field shifted from single-pass pattern generation to multi-step deliberation inference, accelerating deployment, experimentation, and new classes of applications. As this shift unfolded at a rapid pace, our empirical understanding of how these models have actually been used in practice has lagged behind. In this work, we leverage the OpenRouter platform, which is an AI inference provider across a wide variety of LLMs, to analyze over 100 trillion tokens of real-world LLM interactions across tasks, geographies, and time. In our empirical study, we observe substantial adoption of open-weight models, the outsized popularity of creative roleplay (beyond just the productivity tasks many assume dominate) and coding assistance categories, plus the rise of agentic inference. Furthermore, our retention analysis identifies foundational cohorts: early users whose engagement persists far longer than later cohorts. We term this phenomenon the Cinderella \"Glass Slipper\" effect. These findings underscore that the way developers and end-users engage with LLMs \"in the wild\" is complex and multifaceted. We discuss implications for model builders, AI developers, and infrastructure providers, and outline how a data-driven understanding of usage can inform better design and deployment of LLM systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc9c0\ub09c 1\ub144\uac04 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc758 \uc9c4\ud654\uc640 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc804\ud658\uc810\uc774 \uc788\uc5c8\ub2e4. 2024\ub144 12\uc6d4 5\uc77c \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud558\uac8c \ucc44\ud0dd\ub41c \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub378\uc778 o1\uc774 \ucd9c\uc2dc\ub418\uba74\uc11c, \ub2e8\uc77c \ud328\ud134 \uc0dd\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc2ec\uc0ac \ucd94\ub860\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \uc804\ud658\uc774 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc84c\uace0, \uc774\ub294 \ubc30\ud3ec\uc640 \uc2e4\ud5d8, \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc560\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158 \ubd84\uc57c\uc758 \ud655\uc7a5\uc744 \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud588\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubcc0\ud654 \uc18d\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\uc81c \ubaa8\ub378 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \uc774\ud574\ub294 \ub4a4\ucc98\uc84c\ub2e4.

We claim that the distinctive nature of LLMs--namely, their initialization with extensive pre-trained knowledge and implicit social priors, together with their capability of adaptation through in-context learning--motivates the need for an interactionist paradigm consisting of alternative theoretical foundations, methodologies, and analytical tools, in order to systematically examine how prior knowledge and embedded values interact with social context to shape emergent phenomena in multi-agent generative AI systems.

However, research and clinical use are limited by the wide variety of AI implementations and architectures, inconsistent documentation, and reproducibility issues. Here, we introduce MHub.ai, an open-source, container-based platform that standardizes access to AI models with minimal configuration, promoting accessibility and reproducibility in medical imaging. MHub.ai packages models from peer-reviewed publications into standardized containers that support direct processing of DICOM and other formats, provide a unified application interface, and embed structured metadata. Each model is accompanied by publicly available reference data that can be used to confirm model operation. MHub.ai includes an initial set of state-of-the-art segmentation, prediction, and feature extraction models for different modalities. The modular framework enables adaptation of any model and supports community contributions. We demonstrate the utility of the platform in a clinical use case through comparative evaluation of lung segmentation models.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated prowess in short-horizon reasoning, they are easily overwhelmed by execution details in the high-dimensional, delayed-feedback environments of real-world research, failing to consolidate sparse feedback into coherent long-term guidance. Here, we present ML-Master 2.0, an autonomous agent that masters ultra-long-horizon machine learning engineering (MLE) which is a representative microcosm of scientific discovery. By reframing context management as a process of cognitive accumulation, our approach introduces Hierarchical Cognitive Caching (HCC), a multi-tiered architecture inspired by computer systems that enables the structural differentiation of experience over time. By dynamically distilling transient execution traces into stable knowledge and cross-task wisdom, HCC allows agents to decouple immediate execution from long-term experimental strategy, effectively overcoming the scaling limits of static context windows. In evaluations on OpenAI's MLE-Bench under 24-hour budgets, ML-Master 2.0 achieves a state-of-the-art medal rate of 56.44%. Our findings demonstrate that ultra-long-horizon autonomy provides a scalable blueprint for AI capable of autonomous exploration beyond human-precedent complexities.", "AI": {"tldr": "ML-Master 2.0\ub294 \ucd08\uc7a5\uae30 \uc790\uc728 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\ub9c1\uc744 \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud130\ud558\ub294 \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c, \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\ud589 \uc138\ubd80\uc0ac\ud56d\uc5d0 \uc555\ub3c4\ub2f9\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc7a5\uae30 \uc804\ub7b5\uc758 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5\uc774 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uacfc\ud559\uc73c\ub85c \ubc1c\uc804\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ucd08\uc7a5\uae30 \uc790\uc728\uc131\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \ub300\ub450\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uc0ac\uc774\ud074\uc774 \uae38\uc5b4\uc9d0\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uacfc \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \uc218\uc815 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "Hierarchical Cognitive Caching (HCC)\ub77c\ub294 \ub2e4\uacc4\uce35 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uacbd\ud5d8\uc758 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ucc28\ubcc4\ud654\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uba70, \uc989\uac01\uc801\uc778 \uc2e4\ud589\uc744 \uc7a5\uae30 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uc804\ub7b5\uacfc \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc774\ub098\ubbf9\ud558\uac8c \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc815\uc81c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "ML-Master 2.0\uc740 OpenAI\uc758 MLE-Bench\uc5d0\uc11c 24\uc2dc\uac04 \uc608\uc0b0 \ud558\uc5d0 56.44%\uc758 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uba54\ub2ec \ube44\uc728\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ucd08\uc7a5\uae30 \uc790\uc728\uc131\uc740 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \ucd08\uc6d4\ud55c \uc790\uc728 \ud0d0\uc0ac\uac00 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uccad\uc0ac\uc9c4\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uacfc\ud559\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \ud604\uc7ac \uacbd\ud5d8 \uc0ac\uc774\ud074\uc774 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub0a0 \ub610\ub294 \uc8fc\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc9c4\ud589\ub418\ub294 \ucd08\uc7a5\uae30 \uc790\uc728\uc131\uc758 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \ub2e8\uae30 \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0\uc11c \ub450\uac01\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc2e4\uc81c \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \uc9c0\uc5f0 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\ud589 \uc138\ubd80\uc0ac\ud56d\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc27d\uac8c \uc555\ub3c4\ub2f9\ud558\uc5ec, \ub4dc\ubb38 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud574 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uc7a5\uae30 \uc9c0\uce68\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\ud658\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc2e4\ud328\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5ec\uae30\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ucd08\uc7a5\uae30 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\ub9c1(MLE)\uc744 \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud130\ud558\ub294 \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 ML-Master 2.0\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ub9e5\ub77d \uad00\ub9ac\ub97c \uc778\uc9c0\uc801 \ucd95\uc801\uc758 \uacfc\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uc2dc\uac04\uc774 \uc9c0\ub0a8\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uacbd\ud5d8\uc758 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ucc28\ubcc4\ud654\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud130 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc740 \ub2e4\uacc4\uce35 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc778 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc778\uc9c0 \uce90\uc2f1(HCC)\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

We introduce a neuro-symbolic reason-based containment architecture, Governor for Reason-Aligned ContainmEnt (GRACE), that decouples normative reasoning from instrumental decision-making and can contain AI agents of virtually any design. GRACE restructures decision-making into three modules: a Moral Module (MM) that determines permissible macro actions via deontic logic-based reasoning; a Decision-Making Module (DMM) that encapsulates the target agent while selecting instrumentally optimal primitive actions in accordance with derived macro actions; and a Guard that monitors and enforces moral compliance. The MM uses a reason-based formalism providing a semantic foundation for deontic logic, enabling interpretability, contestability, and justifiability. Its symbolic representation enriches the DMM's informational context and supports formal verification and statistical guarantees of alignment enforced by the Guard.

A Mechanistic Analysis of Hierarchical Reasoning Models", "comment": null, "summary": "Hierarchical reasoning model (HRM) achieves extraordinary performance on various reasoning tasks, significantly outperforming large language model-based reasoners. To understand the strengths and potential failure modes of HRM, we conduct a mechanistic study on its reasoning patterns and find three surprising facts: (a) Failure of extremely simple puzzles, e.g., HRM can fail on a puzzle with only one unknown cell. We attribute this failure to the violation of the fixed point property, a fundamental assumption of HRM. (b) \"Grokking\" dynamics in reasoning steps, i.e., the answer is not improved uniformly, but instead there is a critical reasoning step that suddenly makes the answer correct; (c) Existence of multiple fixed points. HRM \"guesses\" the first fixed point, which could be incorrect, and gets trapped there for a while or forever. All facts imply that HRM appears to be \"guessing\" instead of \"reasoning\". Leveraging this \"guessing\" picture, we propose three strategies to scale HRM's guesses: data augmentation (scaling the quality of guesses), input perturbation (scaling the number of guesses by leveraging inference randomness), and model bootstrapping (scaling the number of guesses by leveraging training randomness).

Large language models (LLMs) offer potential for genomic Question Answering (QA) but face limitations due to restricted access to domain-specific databases. GeneGPT is the current state-of-the-art system that enhances LLMs by utilizing specialized API calls, though it is constrained by rigid API dependencies and limited adaptability. We replicate GeneGPT and propose GenomAgent, a multi-agent framework that efficiently coordinates specialized agents for complex genomics queries. Evaluated on nine tasks from the GeneTuring benchmark, GenomAgent outperforms GeneGPT by 12% on average, and its flexible architecture extends beyond genomics to various scientific domains needing expert knowledge extraction.", "AI": {"tldr": "GenomAgent\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc720\uc804\uccb4 \ucffc\ub9ac\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, GeneGPT\ub97c \ub2a5\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc720\uc804\uccb4 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc774\ud574\ub294 \uc0dd\ubb3c \uc758\ud559 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ubd84\uc0b0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ubca0\uc774\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "GeneGPT\ub97c \ubcf5\uc81c\ud558\uace0, \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc720\uc804\uccb4 \ucffc\ub9ac\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uc804\ubb38\ud654\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 GenomAgent\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "GeneTuring \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc758 \uc544\ud649 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, GenomAgent\ub294 GeneGPT\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ud3c9\uade0 12% \ub354 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Flexible architecture\uac00 \uc720\uc804\uccb4 \ud559\uc744 \ub118\uc5b4 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uacfc\ud559 \ubd84\uc57c\uc758 \uc804\ubb38 \uc9c0\uc2dd \ucd94\ucd9c\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc720\uc804\uccb4 \uc815\ubcf4\uc758 \uc774\ud574\ub294 \uc0dd\ubb3c \uc758\ud559 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ubd84\uc0b0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ubca0\uc774\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\ub2e4. \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \uc720\uc804\uccb4 \uc9c8\ubb38 \uc751\ub2f5(QA)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\ud654 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ubca0\uc774\uc2a4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \uc81c\ud55c\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.
