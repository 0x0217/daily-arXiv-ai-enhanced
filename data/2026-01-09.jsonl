However, due to insufficient collaborative and perceptual capabilities, existing methods are inadequate for scaling across diverse environmental conditions. To address these challenges, we propose PC2P, a novel distributed MAPF method derived from a Q-learning-based MARL framework. Initially, we introduce a personalized-enhanced communication mechanism based on dynamic graph topology, which ascertains the core aspects of ``who\" and ``what\" in interactive process through three-stage operations: selection, generation, and aggregation. Concurrently, we incorporate local crowd perception to enrich agents' heuristic observation, thereby strengthening the model's guidance for effective actions via the integration of static spatial constraints and dynamic occupancy changes. To resolve extreme deadlock issues, we propose a region-based deadlock-breaking strategy that leverages expert guidance to implement efficient coordination within confined areas. Experimental results demonstrate that PC2P achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art distributed MAPF methods in varied environments. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of each module for overall performance."}

Three real-world case studies are tested in controlled, containerised pilots in telecommunications security, national heritage asset management, and utilities customer service automation. Initial empirical results show that, for these case studies, prototypes were delivered within two weeks and pilot-ready solutions within one month, suggesting reduced development overhead compared to conventional approaches and improved user accessibility. However, findings also reinforce limitations documented in the literature, including variability in LLM behaviour that leads to challenges in transitioning from prototype to production maturity.

However, traditional human-dependent chromatographic process development faces challenges such as reliance on expert experience, long development cycles, and labor intensity. ChromR, a large language model (LLM)-driven platform for chromatographic process design and optimization, is presented in this work. The platform integrates ChromLLM, a domain-specific LLM trained for chromatography, along with a multi-agent system and an automated chromatographic experimental device. The multi-agent system comprises four agents: domain knowledge answering, experimental design, experimental execution, and data analysis. ChromR enables automatic completion of the entire workflow-including initial process parameter recommendation, experimental design, automated execution, data analysis, and multi-objective optimization. By utilizing ChromR, dependency on expert knowledge is effectively reduced, while labor input and development time are significantly decreased. Chromatographic purification of the extract of Ginkgo biloba leaf (EGBL) was selected as a case study. ChromR successfully developed a chromatographic process within one week that meets multiple objectives, including fraction quality and production efficiency, reducing development time to approximately one-seventh of that required by the conventional paradigm. An intelligent, automated, and universally applicable new paradigm was established for chromatographic process development."}

While existing work has largely focused on individual agents or on interacting agents sharing explicit communication, less is known about how interacting agents coordinate implicitly. In particular, agents may engage in covert communication, relying on indirect or non-linguistic signals embedded in their actions rather than on explicit messages. This paper presents a game-theoretic study of covert communication in LLM-driven multi-agent systems. We analyse interactions across four canonical game-theoretic settings under different communication regimes, including explicit, restricted, and absent communication. Considering heterogeneous agent personalities and both one-shot and repeated games, we characterise when covert signals emerge and how they shape coordination and strategic outcomes."}

However, unlike biological evolution, most LLM-evolution frameworks are formulated as static optimization problems, overlooking the open-ended adversarial dynamics that characterize real-world evolutionary processes. Here, we study Digital Red Queen (DRQ), a simple self-play algorithm that embraces these so-called \"Red Queen\" dynamics via continual adaptation to a changing objective. DRQ uses an LLM to evolve assembly-like programs, called warriors, which compete against each other for control of a virtual machine in the game of Core War, a Turing-complete environment studied in artificial life and connected to cybersecurity. In each round of DRQ, the model evolves a new warrior to defeat all previous ones, producing a sequence of adapted warriors. Over many rounds, we observe that warriors become increasingly general (relative to a set of held-out human warriors). Interestingly, warriors also become less behaviorally diverse across independent runs, indicating a convergence pressure toward a general-purpose behavioral strategy, much like convergent evolution in nature. This result highlights a potential value of shifting from static objectives to dynamic Red Queen objectives. Our work positions Core War as a rich, controllable sandbox for studying adversarial adaptation in artificial systems and for evaluating LLM-based evolution methods. More broadly, the simplicity and effectiveness of DRQ suggest that similarly minimal self-play approaches could prove useful in other more practical multi-agent adversarial domains, like real-world cybersecurity or combating drug resistance."}

This paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can augment post-incident review workflows by autonomously analysing system evidence and identifying security policy gaps. We present a threat-informed, agentic framework that ingests log data, maps observed behaviours to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, and evaluates organisational security policies for adequacy and compliance. Using a simulated brute-force attack scenario against a Windows OpenSSH service (MITRE ATT&CK T1110), the system leverages GPT-4o for reasoning, LangGraph for multi-agent workflow orchestration, and LlamaIndex for traceable policy retrieval. Experimental results indicate that the LLM-based pipeline can interpret log-derived evidence, identify insufficient or missing policy controls, and generate actionable remediation recommendations with explicit evidence-to-policy traceability. Unlike prior work that treats log analysis and policy validation as isolated tasks, this study integrates both into a unified end-to-end proof-of-concept post-incident review framework. The findings suggest that LLM-assisted analysis has the potential to improve the efficiency, consistency, and auditability of post-incident evaluations, while highlighting the continued need for human oversight in high-stakes cybersecurity decision-making."}

Standard supervised fine-tuning often fails to strictly align linguistic outputs with visual evidence, while existing reinforcement learning approaches struggle with either prohibitive computational costs or limited exploration. To address these challenges, we propose a comprehensive framework for self-consistent radiology report generation. First, we conduct a systematic evaluation to identify optimal vision encoder and LLM backbone configurations for medical imaging. Building on this foundation, we introduce a novel \"Reason-then-Summarize\" architecture optimized via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). This framework restructures generation into two distinct components: a think block for detailed findings and an answer block for structured disease labels. By utilizing a multi-dimensional composite reward function, we explicitly penalize logical discrepancies between the generated narrative and the final diagnosis. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC-CXR benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in clinical efficacy metrics and significantly reduces hallucinations compared to strong supervised baselines."}

While content watermarking effectively attributes LLM-generated outputs, it fails to directly identify the high-level planning behaviors (e.g., tool and subgoal choices) that govern multi-step execution. Critically, watermarking at the planning-behavior layer faces unique challenges: minor distributional deviations in decision-making can compound during long-term agent operation, degrading utility, and many agents operate as black boxes that are difficult to intervene in directly. To bridge this gap, we propose AgentMark, a behavioral watermarking framework that embeds multi-bit identifiers into planning decisions while preserving utility. It operates by eliciting an explicit behavior distribution from the agent and applying distribution-preserving conditional sampling, enabling deployment under black-box APIs while remaining compatible with action-layer content watermarking. Experiments across embodied, tool-use, and social environments demonstrate practical multi-bit capacity, robust recovery from partial logs, and utility preservation.

This signal is integrated into a subjective reward function to study how self-awareness affects the agent's learning abilities.

However, its use in clinical practice is limited by cost, turnaround time, and tissue requirements, thereby restricting its application in the management of PDAC.

PanSubNet was developed using data from 1,055 patients across two multi-institutional cohorts (PANCAN, n=846; TCGA, n=209) with paired histology and RNA-seq data. Ground-truth labels were derived using the validated Moffitt 50-gene signature refined by GATA6 expression. The model employs dual-scale architecture that fuses cellular-level morphology with tissue-level architecture, leveraging attention mechanisms for multi-scale representation learning and transparent feature attribution. On internal validation within PANCAN using five-fold cross-validation, PanSubNet achieved mean AUC of 88.5% with balanced sensitivity and specificity. External validation on the independent TCGA cohort without fine-tuning demonstrated robust generalizability (AUC 84.0%). PanSubNet preserved and, in metastatic disease, strengthened prognostic stratification compared to RNA-seq based labels. Prediction uncertainty linked to intermediate transcriptional states, not classification noise. Model predictions are aligned with established transcriptomic programs, differentiation markers, and DNA damage repair signatures. By enabling rapid, cost-effective molecular stratification from routine H&E-stained slides, PanSubNet offers a clinically deployable and interpretable tool for genetic subtyping.

On the methodological side, we formulate a population EM operator in the DAG parameter space and introduce a first-order (gradient) EM update that replaces the costly generalized least-squares M-step with a single projected gradient step. Under standard local strong-concavity and smoothness assumptions and a BWY-style \\cite{Balakrishnan2017EM} gradient-stability (bounded missing-information) condition, we show that this first-order EM operator is locally contractive around the true target parameters, yielding geometric convergence and finite-sample guarantees on parameter error and the induced target-imputation error in Gaussian SEMs under covariate shift and local mechanism shifts. Algorithmically, we exploit the known causal DAG to freeze source-invariant mechanisms and re-estimate only those conditional distributions directly affected by the shift, making the procedure scalable to higher-dimensional models. In experiments on a synthetic seven-node SEM, the 64-node MAGIC-IRRI genetic network, and the Sachs protein-signaling data, the proposed DAG-aware first-order EM algorithm improves target imputation accuracy over a fit-on-source Bayesian network and a Kiiveri-style EM baseline, with the largest gains under pronounced domain shift."}

In an effort to complement the ingrained \"knowledge\" of LLMs, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques have become widely popular. At its core, RAG involves the coupling of LLMs with domain-specific knowledge bases, whereby the generation of a response to a user question is augmented with contextual and up-to-date information. The proliferation of RAG has sparked concerns about data privacy, particularly with the inherent risks that arise when leveraging databases with potentially sensitive information. Numerous recent works have explored various aspects of privacy risks in RAG systems, from adversarial attacks to proposed mitigations. With the goal of surveying and unifying these works, we ask one simple question: What are the privacy risks in RAG, and how can they be measured and mitigated? To answer this question, we conduct a systematic literature review of RAG works addressing privacy, and we systematize our findings into a comprehensive set of privacy risks, mitigation techniques, and evaluation strategies. We supplement these findings with two primary artifacts: a Taxonomy of RAG Privacy Risks and a RAG Privacy Process Diagram. Our work contributes to the study of privacy in RAG not only by conducting the first systematization of risks and mitigations, but also by uncovering important considerations when mitigating privacy risks in RAG systems and assessing the current maturity of proposed mitigations."}

SCRIBE grounds reward modeling in a curated library of skill prototypes, transforming open-ended LLM evaluation into a constrained verification problem. By routing each subgoal to a corresponding prototype, the reward model is equipped with precise, structured rubrics that substantially reduce reward variance.\n  Experimental results show that SCRIBE achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of reasoning and tool-use benchmarks. In particular, it improves the AIME25 accuracy of a Qwen3-4B model from 43.3% to 63.3%, and significantly increases success rates in complex multi-turn tool interactions.\n  Further analysis of training dynamics reveals a co-evolution across abstraction levels, where mastery of mid-level skills consistently precedes the emergence of effective high-level planning behaviors. Finally, we demonstrate that SCRIBE is additive to low-level tool optimizations, providing a scalable and complementary pathway toward more autonomous and reliable tool-using agents."}

However, due to the resource constraints of certain hardware, maintaining high accuracy with larger model while meeting the hardware requirements remains a significant challenge. Model quantization technique helps mitigate memory and compute bottlenecks, yet the added complexities of tuning and deploying quantized models further exacerbates these challenges, making the process unfriendly to most of the users. We introduce the Hardware-Aware Quantization Agent (HAQA), an automated framework that leverages LLMs to streamline the entire quantization and deployment process by enabling efficient hyperparameter tuning and hardware configuration, thereby simultaneously improving deployment quality and ease of use for a broad range of users. Our results demonstrate up to a 2.3x speedup in inference, along with increased throughput and improved accuracy compared to unoptimized models on Llama. Additionally, HAQA is designed to implement adaptive quantization strategies across diverse hardware platforms, as it automatically finds optimal settings even when they appear counterintuitive, thereby reducing extensive manual effort and demonstrating superior adaptability.

To address this critical challenge, we propose HoneyTrap, a novel deceptive LLM defense framework leveraging collaborative defenders to counter jailbreak attacks. It integrates four defensive agents, Threat Interceptor, Misdirection Controller, Forensic Tracker, and System Harmonizer, each performing a specialized security role and collaborating to complete a deceptive defense. To ensure a comprehensive evaluation, we introduce MTJ-Pro, a challenging multi-turn progressive jailbreak dataset that combines seven advanced jailbreak strategies designed to gradually deepen attack strategies across multi-turn attacks. Besides, we present two novel metrics: Mislead Success Rate (MSR) and Attack Resource Consumption (ARC), which provide more nuanced assessments of deceptive defense beyond conventional measures. Experimental results on GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo, Gemini-1.5-pro, and LLaMa-3.1 demonstrate that HoneyTrap achieves an average reduction of 68.77% in attack success rates compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, even in a dedicated adaptive attacker setting with intensified conditions, HoneyTrap remains resilient, leveraging deceptive engagement to prolong interactions, significantly increasing the time and computational costs required for successful exploitation.

We argue that protein function prediction is a knowledge-intensive scientific task that fundamentally relies on external biological priors and computational tools rather than purely internal reasoning. To address this gap, we propose PFUA, a tool-augmented protein reasoning agent that unifies problem decomposition, tool invocation, and grounded answer generation. Instead of relying on long unconstrained reasoning traces, PFUA integrates domain-specific tools to produce verifiable intermediate evidence. Experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that PFUA consistently outperforms text-only reasoning models with an average performance improvement of 103%."}

Here, we show that client heterogeneity destabilizes FL primarily by distorting local gradient dynamics during client-side optimization, causing systematic drift that accumulates across communication rounds and impedes global convergence. This observation highlights local gradients as a key regulatory lever for stabilizing heterogeneous FL systems. Building on this insight, we develop a general client-side perspective that regulates local gradient contributions without incurring additional communication overhead. Inspired by swarm intelligence, we instantiate this perspective through Exploratory--Convergent Gradient Re-aggregation (ECGR), which balances well-aligned and misaligned gradient components to preserve informative updates while suppressing destabilizing effects. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, including evaluations on the LC25000 medical imaging dataset, demonstrate that regulating local gradient dynamics consistently stabilizes federated learning across state-of-the-art methods under heterogeneous data distributions."}

We focus on Agentic Communities - coordination frameworks encompassing LLM Agents, Agentic AI entities, and humans - most relevant for enterprise and industrial applications. Drawing on established coordination principles from distributed systems, we ground these patterns in a formal framework that specifies collaboration agreements where AI agents and humans fill roles within governed ecosystems. This approach provides both practical guidance and formal verification capabilities, enabling expression of organizational, legal, and ethical rules through accountability mechanisms that ensure operational and verifiable governance of inter-agent communication, negotiation, and intent modeling.

However, this approach treats all time steps and hidden states equally without considering their distinct contributions to forecasting, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Reinforced Recurrent Encoder with Prediction-oriented Proximal Policy Optimization, RRE-PPO4Pred, which significantly improves time series modeling capacity and forecasting accuracy of the RNN models. The core innovations of this method are: (1) A novel Reinforced Recurrent Encoder (RRE) framework that enhances RNNs by formulating their internal adaptation as a Markov Decision Process, creating a unified decision environment capable of learning input feature selection, hidden skip connection, and output target selection; (2) An improved Prediction-oriented Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm, termed PPO4Pred, which is equipped with a Transformer-based agent for temporal reasoning and develops a dynamic transition sampling strategy to enhance sampling efficiency; (3) A co-evolutionary optimization paradigm to facilitate the learning of the RNN predictor and the policy agent, providing adaptive and interactive time series modeling.

Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves accuracy but incurs prohibitive latency for real-time query correction. A potential solution is to output an answer before reasoning to reduce latency; however, under autoregressive decoding, the early answer is independent of subsequent reasoning, preventing the model from leveraging its reasoning capability to improve accuracy. To address this issue, we propose Sandwich Reasoning (SandwichR), a novel approach that explicitly aligns a fast initial answer with post-hoc reasoning, enabling low-latency query correction without sacrificing reasoning-aware accuracy. SandwichR follows an Answer-Reasoning-Answer paradigm, producing an initial correction, an explicit reasoning process, and a final refined correction. To align the initial answer with post-reasoning insights, we design a consistency-aware reinforcement learning (RL) strategy: a dedicated consistency reward enforces alignment between the initial and final corrections, while margin-based rejection sampling prioritizes borderline samples where reasoning drives the most impactful corrective gains. Additionally, we construct a high-quality query correction dataset, addressing the lack of specialized benchmarks for complex query correction. Experimental results demonstrate that SandwichR achieves SOTA accuracy comparable to standard CoT while delivering a 40-70% latency reduction, resolving the latency-accuracy trade-off in online search."}

Exploration suffers from low success rates on difficult tasks and high costs of repeated rollouts from scratch.

To this end, we propose R$^3$L, Reflect-then-Retry Reinforcement Learning with Language-Guided Exploration, Pivotal Credit, and Positive Amplification. To synthesize high-quality trajectories, R$^3$L shifts from stochastic sampling to active synthesis via reflect-then-retry, leveraging language feedback to diagnose errors, transform failed attempts into successful ones, and reduce rollout costs by restarting from identified failure points. With errors diagnosed and localized, Pivotal Credit Assignment updates only the diverging suffix where contrastive signals exist, excluding the shared prefix from gradient update. Since failures dominate on difficult tasks and reflect-then-retry produces off-policy data, risking training instability, Positive Amplification upweights successful trajectories to ensure positive signals guide the optimization process.

Zero-shot node classification in text-attributed graphs (TAGs) presents a significant challenge, particularly due to the absence of labeled data. In this paper, we propose a novel Zero-shot Prompt Tuning (ZPT) framework to address this problem by leveraging a Universal Bimodal Conditional Generator (UBCG). Our approach begins with pre-training a graph-language model to capture both the graph structure and the associated textual descriptions of each node. Following this, a conditional generative model is trained to learn the joint distribution of nodes in both graph and text modalities, enabling the generation of synthetic samples for each class based solely on the class name. These synthetic node and text embeddings are subsequently used to perform continuous prompt tuning, facilitating effective node classification in a zero-shot setting. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating that our framework performs better than existing state-of-the-art baselines. We also provide ablation studies to validate the contribution of the bimodal generator. The code is provided at: https://github.com/Sethup123/ZPT."}

Generative world models offer a promising remedy: agents could use them as external simulators to foresee outcomes before acting. This paper empirically examines whether current agents can leverage such world models as tools to enhance their cognition. Across diverse agentic and visual question answering tasks, we observe that some agents rarely invoke simulation (fewer than 1%), frequently misuse predicted rollouts (approximately 15%), and often exhibit inconsistent or even degraded performance (up to 5%) when simulation is available or enforced. Attribution analysis further indicates that the primary bottleneck lies in the agents' capacity to decide when to simulate, how to interpret predicted outcomes, and how to integrate foresight into downstream reasoning. These findings underscore the need for mechanisms that foster calibrated, strategic interaction with world models, paving the way toward more reliable anticipatory cognition in future agent systems."}

To address these limitations, we introduce FALCON, a framework that enhances the effectiveness of OSFL over non-IID image data. The core idea of FALCON is to leverage the feature-aware hierarchical token sequences generation and knowledge distillation into OSFL. First, each client leverages a pretrained visual encoder with hierarchical scale encoding to compress images into hierarchical token sequences, which capture multi-scale semantics. Second, a multi-scale autoregressive transformer generator is used to model the distribution of these token sequences and generate the synthetic sequences. Third, clients upload the synthetic sequences along with the local classifier trained on the real token sequences to the server. Finally, the server incorporates knowledge distillation into global training to reduce reliance on precise distribution modeling. Experiments on medical and natural image datasets validate the effectiveness of FALCON in diverse non-IID scenarios, outperforming the best OSFL baselines by 9.58% in average accuracy."}

However, the limited availability of radar sleep data poses challenges in building robust models that generalize across diverse cohorts and environments.

Methods: An end-to-end neural network was developed to classify sleep stages based on nocturnal respiratory and motion signals. The network was trained using a combination of large-scale polysomnography (PSG) datasets and radar data. A domain adaptation approach employing adversarial learning was utilized to bridge the knowledge gap between PSG and radar signals. Validation was performed on a radar dataset of 47 older adults (mean age: 71.2), including 18 participants with prodromal or mild Alzheimer disease. Results: The proposed network structure achieves an accuracy of 79.5% with a Kappa value of 0.65 when classifying wakefulness, rapid eye movement, light sleep and deep sleep. Experimental results confirm that our deep transfer learning approach significantly enhances automatic sleep staging performance in the target domain.

Preprint", "summary": "Cybersecurity post-incident reviews are essential for identifying control failures and improving organisational resilience, yet they remain labour-intensive, time-consuming, and heavily reliant on expert judgment. This paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can augment post-incident review workflows by autonomously analysing system evidence and identifying security policy gaps. We present a threat-informed, agentic framework that ingests log data, maps observed behaviours to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, and evaluates organisational security policies for adequacy and compliance. Using a simulated brute-force attack scenario against a Windows OpenSSH service (MITRE ATT&CK T1110), the system leverages GPT-4o for reasoning, LangGraph for multi-agent workflow orchestration, and LlamaIndex for traceable policy retrieval. Experimental results indicate that the LLM-based pipeline can interpret log-derived evidence, identify insufficient or missing policy controls, and generate actionable remediation recommendations with explicit evidence-to-policy traceability. Unlike prior work that treats log analysis and policy validation as isolated tasks, this study integrates both into a unified end-to-end proof-of-concept post-incident review framework. The findings suggest that LLM-assisted analysis has the potential to improve the efficiency, consistency, and auditability of post-incident evaluations, while highlighting the continued need for human oversight in high-stakes cybersecurity decision-making."}

Evidence points to a unified system for self- and other-awareness. We explore this self-awareness by having reinforcement learning agents infer their own internal states in gridworld environments. Specifically, we introduce an introspective exploration component that is inspired by biological pain as a learning signal by utilizing a hidden Markov model to infer \"pain-belief\" from online observations. This signal is integrated into a subjective reward function to study how self-awareness affects the agent's learning abilities. Further, we use this computational framework to investigate the difference in performance between normal and chronic pain perception models. Results show that introspective agents in general significantly outperform standard baseline agents and can replicate complex human-like behaviors."}

While content watermarking effectively attributes LLM-generated outputs, it fails to directly identify the high-level planning behaviors (e.g., tool and subgoal choices) that govern multi-step execution. Critically, watermarking at the planning-behavior layer faces unique challenges: minor distributional deviations in decision-making can compound during long-term agent operation, degrading utility, and many agents operate as black boxes that are difficult to intervene in directly. To bridge this gap, we propose AgentMark, a behavioral watermarking framework that embeds multi-bit identifiers into planning decisions while preserving utility. It operates by eliciting an explicit behavior distribution from the agent and applying distribution-preserving conditional sampling, enabling deployment under black-box APIs while remaining compatible with action-layer content watermarking. Experiments across embodied, tool-use, and social environments demonstrate practical multi-bit capacity, robust recovery from partial logs, and utility preservation.

Generative world models offer a promising remedy: agents could use them as external simulators to foresee outcomes before acting. This paper empirically examines whether current agents can leverage such world models as tools to enhance their cognition. Across diverse agentic and visual question answering tasks, we observe that some agents rarely invoke simulation (fewer than 1%), frequently misuse predicted rollouts (approximately 15%), and often exhibit inconsistent or even degraded performance (up to 5%) when simulation is available or enforced. Attribution analysis further indicates that the primary bottleneck lies in the agents' capacity to decide when to simulate, how to interpret predicted outcomes, and how to integrate foresight into downstream reasoning. These findings underscore the need for mechanisms that foster calibrated, strategic interaction with world models, paving the way toward more reliable anticipatory cognition in future agent systems."}

However, due to insufficient collaborative and perceptual capabilities, existing methods are inadequate for scaling across diverse environmental conditions. To address these challenges, we propose PC2P, a novel distributed MAPF method derived from a Q-learning-based MARL framework. Initially, we introduce a personalized-enhanced communication mechanism based on dynamic graph topology, which ascertains the core aspects of ``who\" and ``what\" in interactive process through three-stage operations: selection, generation, and aggregation. Concurrently, we incorporate local crowd perception to enrich agents' heuristic observation, thereby strengthening the model's guidance for effective actions via the integration of static spatial constraints and dynamic occupancy changes. To resolve extreme deadlock issues, we propose a region-based deadlock-breaking strategy that leverages expert guidance to implement efficient coordination within confined areas. Experimental results demonstrate that PC2P achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art distributed MAPF methods in varied environments. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of each module for overall performance."}

From these attempts, we document six recurring failure modes: bias toward training data defaults, implementation drift under execution pressure, memory and context degradation across long-horizon tasks, overexcitement that declares success despite obvious failures, insufficient domain intelligence, and weak scientific taste in experimental design.

Standard supervised fine-tuning often fails to strictly align linguistic outputs with visual evidence, while existing reinforcement learning approaches struggle with either prohibitive computational costs or limited exploration. To address these challenges, we propose a comprehensive framework for self-consistent radiology report generation. First, we conduct a systematic evaluation to identify optimal vision encoder and LLM backbone configurations for medical imaging. Building on this foundation, we introduce a novel \"Reason-then-Summarize\" architecture optimized via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). This framework restructures generation into two distinct components: a think block for detailed findings and an answer block for structured disease labels. By utilizing a multi-dimensional composite reward function, we explicitly penalize logical discrepancies between the generated narrative and the final diagnosis. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC-CXR benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in clinical efficacy metrics and significantly reduces hallucinations compared to strong supervised baselines."}

We propose a unified EM-based framework that combines source and target data through the DAG structure to transfer information from observed variables to the missing target. On the methodological side, we formulate a population EM operator in the DAG parameter space and introduce a first-order (gradient) EM update that replaces the costly generalized least-squares M-step with a single projected gradient step. Under standard local strong-concavity and smoothness assumptions and a BWY-style \\cite{Balakrishnan2017EM} gradient-stability (bounded missing-information) condition, we show that this first-order EM operator is locally contractive around the true target parameters, yielding geometric convergence and finite-sample guarantees on parameter error and the induced target-imputation error in Gaussian SEMs under covariate shift and local mechanism shifts. Algorithmically, we exploit the known causal DAG to freeze source-invariant mechanisms and re-estimate only those conditional distributions directly affected by the shift, making the procedure scalable to higher-dimensional models. In experiments on a synthetic seven-node SEM, the 64-node MAGIC-IRRI genetic network, and the Sachs protein-signaling data, the proposed DAG-aware first-order EM algorithm improves target imputation accuracy over a fit-on-source Bayesian network and a Kiiveri-style EM baseline, with the largest gains under pronounced domain shift."}

Exploration suffers from low success rates on difficult tasks and high costs of repeated rollouts from scratch. Exploitation suffers from coarse credit assignment and training instability: Trajectory-level rewards penalize valid prefixes for later errors, and failure-dominated groups overwhelm the few positive signals, leaving optimization without constructive direction. To this end, we propose R$^3$L, Reflect-then-Retry Reinforcement Learning with Language-Guided Exploration, Pivotal Credit, and Positive Amplification. To synthesize high-quality trajectories, R$^3$L shifts from stochastic sampling to active synthesis via reflect-then-retry, leveraging language feedback to diagnose errors, transform failed attempts into successful ones, and reduce rollout costs by restarting from identified failure points. With errors diagnosed and localized, Pivotal Credit Assignment updates only the diverging suffix where contrastive signals exist, excluding the shared prefix from gradient update. Since failures dominate on difficult tasks and reflect-then-retry produces off-policy data, risking training instability, Positive Amplification upweights successful trajectories to ensure positive signals guide the optimization process. Experiments on agentic and reasoning tasks demonstrate 5\\% to 52\\% relative improvements over baselines while maintaining training stability.

While existing work has largely focused on individual agents or on interacting agents sharing explicit communication, less is known about how interacting agents coordinate implicitly. In particular, agents may engage in covert communication, relying on indirect or non-linguistic signals embedded in their actions rather than on explicit messages. This paper presents a game-theoretic study of covert communication in LLM-driven multi-agent systems. We analyse interactions across four canonical game-theoretic settings under different communication regimes, including explicit, restricted, and absent communication. Considering heterogeneous agent personalities and both one-shot and repeated games, we characterise when covert signals emerge and how they shape coordination and strategic outcomes."}

However, existing reactive defense approaches struggle to keep up with the rapidly evolving multi-turn jailbreaks, where attackers continuously deepen their attacks to exploit vulnerabilities. To address this critical challenge, we propose HoneyTrap, a novel deceptive LLM defense framework leveraging collaborative defenders to counter jailbreak attacks. It integrates four defensive agents, Threat Interceptor, Misdirection Controller, Forensic Tracker, and System Harmonizer, each performing a specialized security role and collaborating to complete a deceptive defense. To ensure a comprehensive evaluation, we introduce MTJ-Pro, a challenging multi-turn progressive jailbreak dataset that combines seven advanced jailbreak strategies designed to gradually deepen attack strategies across multi-turn attacks. Besides, we present two novel metrics: Mislead Success Rate (MSR) and Attack Resource Consumption (ARC), which provide more nuanced assessments of deceptive defense beyond conventional measures. Experimental results on GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo, Gemini-1.5-pro, and LLaMa-3.1 demonstrate that HoneyTrap achieves an average reduction of 68.77% in attack success rates compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, even in a dedicated adaptive attacker setting with intensified conditions, HoneyTrap remains resilient, leveraging deceptive engagement to prolong interactions, significantly increasing the time and computational costs required for successful exploitation. Unlike simple rejection, HoneyTrap strategically wastes attacker resources without impacting benign queries, improving MSR and ARC by 118.11% and 149.16%, respectively."}
