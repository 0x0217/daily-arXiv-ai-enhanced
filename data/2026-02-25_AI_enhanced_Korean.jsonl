Despite the high cost of creating these datasets, existing literature has overlooked copyright protection for LLM agent trajectories. This gap leaves creators vulnerable to data theft and makes it difficult to trace misuse or enforce ownership rights. This paper introduces ActHook, the first watermarking method tailored for agent trajectory datasets. Inspired by hook mechanisms in software engineering, ActHook embeds hook actions that are activated by a secret input key and do not alter the original task outcome. Like software execution, LLM agents operate sequentially, allowing hook actions to be inserted at decision points without disrupting task flow. When the activation key is present, an LLM agent trained on watermarked trajectories can produce these hook actions at a significantly higher rate, enabling reliable black-box detection. Experiments on mathematical reasoning, web searching, and software engineering agents show that ActHook achieves an average detection AUC of 94.3 on Qwen-2.5-Coder-7B while incurring negligible performance degradation.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc548\ub0b4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \uada4\uc801 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud574 ActHook\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud0b9 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 \ubb38\ud5cc\uc740 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uada4\uc801\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc800\uc791\uad8c \ubcf4\ud638\ub97c \uac04\uacfc\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ucc3d\uc791\uc790\uac00 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ub3c4\ub09c\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud574\uc9c0\uace0 \uc18c\uc720\uad8c\uc744 \ucd94\uc801\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc9d1\ud589\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6cc\uc9c4\ub2e4.", "method": "ActHook\uc740 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\ub9c1\uc758 \ud6c5 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc5d0\uc11c \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc544 \ube44\ubc00 \uc785\ub825 \ud0a4\ub85c \ud65c\uc131\ud654\ub418\ub294 \ud6c5 \ub3d9\uc791\uc744 \uada4\uc801 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub0b4\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc218\ud559\uc801 \ucd94\ub860, \uc6f9 \uac80\uc0c9 \ubc0f \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uacf5\ud559 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc ActHook\uc740 Qwen-2.5-Coder-7B\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uade0 \ud0d0\uc9c0 AUC 94.3\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubb3c\uc9c8 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc800\ud558\ub97c \uac70\uc758 \ucd08\ub798\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uac00 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc548\ub0b4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \uada4\uc801 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ud06c\uac8c \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub824\uba74 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5 \uc124\uacc4, \ub300\uc6a9\ub7c9 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc0dd\uc131, \uc218\ub3d9 \ud544\ud130\ub9c1\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub4dc\ub294 \ub192\uc740 \ube44\uc6a9\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \uae30\uc874 \ubb38\ud5cc\uc740 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uada4\uc801\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc800\uc791\uad8c \ubcf4\ud638\ub97c \uac04\uacfc\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uaca9\ucc28\ub294 \ucc3d\uc791\uc790\ub97c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ub3c4\ub09c\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4e4\uace0 \ub0a8\uc6a9\uc744 \ucd94\uc801\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc18c\uc720\uad8c\uc744 \uc9d1\ud589\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc5b4\ub835\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4ed\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uada4\uc801 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucdb0\uc9c4 \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud0b9 \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 ActHook\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\ub9c1\uc758 \ud6c5 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc5d0\uc11c \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc544 ActHook\uc740 \ube44\ubc00 \uc785\ub825 \ud0a4\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ud65c\uc131\ud654\ub418\uace0 \uc6d0\ub798 \uc791\uc5c5 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubcc0\uacbd\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \ud6c5 \ub3d9\uc791\uc744 \ub0b4\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uc2e4\ud589\uacfc \ub9c8\ucc2c\uac00\uc9c0\ub85c LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc21c\ucc28\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\ubbc0\ub85c \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \uc9c0\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\uc5c5 \ud750\ub984\uc744 \ubc29\ud574\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \ud6c5 \ub3d9\uc791\uc744 \uc0bd\uc785\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud65c\uc131\ud654 \ud0a4\uac00 \uc874\uc7ac\ud560 \ub54c, \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud06c\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \uada4\uc801\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud6c5 \ub3d9\uc791\uc744 \ud6e8\uc52c \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \ube44\uc728\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uac00 \uac00\ub2a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc218\ud559\uc801 \ucd94\ub860, \uc6f9 \uac80\uc0c9 \ubc0f \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uacf5\ud559 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc ActHook\uc740 Qwen-2.5-Coder-7B\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uade0 \ud0d0\uc9c0 AUC 94.3\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc800\ud558\ub294 \uac70\uc758 \uc5c6\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Yet, practitioners lack systematic guidance to assess the synergistic and non-additive interactions of these hybrid configurations, relying instead on isolated technique analysis that misses critical system level interactions. We introduce PrivacyBench, a benchmarking framework that reveals striking failures in privacy technique combinations with severe deployment implications. Through systematic evaluation across ResNet18 and ViT models on medical datasets, we uncover that FL + DP combinations exhibit severe convergence failure, with accuracy dropping from 98% to 13% while compute costs and energy consumption substantially increase. In contrast, FL + SMPC maintains near-baseline performance with modest overhead. Our framework provides the first systematic platform for evaluating privacy-utility-cost trade-offs through automated YAML configuration, resource monitoring, and reproducible experimental protocols. PrivacyBench enables practitioners to identify problematic technique interactions before deployment, moving privacy-preserving computer vision from ad-hoc evaluation toward principled systems design. These findings demonstrate that privacy techniques cannot be composed arbitrarily and provide critical guidance for robust deployment in resource-constrained environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd \uc751\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc \ubcf4\ud638 \uae30\ubc95 \uc870\ud569\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc801 \uac00\uc774\ub4dc\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\ub294 PrivacyBench \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd \uc751\uc6a9, \ud2b9\ud788 \uc758\ub8cc \uc601\uc0c1 \ubc0f \uc790\uc728 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc \ubcf4\ud638 \uae30\ubc95\uc758 \uc870\ud569\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc2e4\ubb34\uc790\ub4e4\uc740 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \uc9c0\uce68\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "PrivacyBench\ub77c\ub294 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud0b9 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec, \uc758\ub8cc \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c ResNet18 \ubc0f ViT \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uae30\ubc95 \uc870\ud569\uc758 \uc2e4\ud328\ub97c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "FL + DP \uc870\ud569\uc740 \uc218\ub834 \uc2e4\ud328\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub294 98%\uc5d0\uc11c 13%\ub85c \ub5a8\uc5b4\uc84c\uace0, \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uacfc \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc18c\ube44\ub294 \ud06c\uac8c \uc99d\uac00\ud588\ub2e4. \ubc18\uba74 FL + SMPC \uc870\ud569\uc740 \uc57d\uac04\uc758 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \uac70\uc758 \uae30\uc900 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "PrivacyBench\ub294 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc-\uc720\uc6a9\uc131-\ube44\uc6a9 trade-offs\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc1c\uacac\uc740 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc \ubcf4\ud638 \uae30\uc220\uc774 \uc784\uc758\ub85c \uc870\ud569\ub420 \uc218 \uc5c6\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uace0 \uc790\uc6d0 \uc81c\uc57d\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ubc30\uce58\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc9c0\uce68\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8, \ud2b9\ud788 \uc758\ub8cc \uc601\uc0c1 \ubc0f \uc790\uc728 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc\ub97c \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\ub294 \uba38\uc2e0\ub7ec\ub2dd \ubc30\ud3ec\ub294 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uae30\uc220\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc2e4\ubb34\uc790\ub4e4\uc740 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uad6c\uc131\uc758 \uc2dc\ub108\uc9c0 \ubc0f \ube44\uac00\ubc95\uc801 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \uc9c0\uce68\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uc5ec, \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ub193\uce5c \ucc44 \uac1c\ubcc4 \uae30\uc220 \ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 PrivacyBench\ub77c\ub294 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud0b9 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \ubc30\uce58 \uc758\ubbf8\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc \uae30\ubc95 \uc870\ud569\uc758 \ub180\ub77c\uc6b4 \uc2e4\ud328\ub97c \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b8\ub2e4. \uc758\ub8cc \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c ResNet18 \ubc0f ViT \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, FL + DP \uc870\ud569\uc774 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \uc218\ub834 \uc2e4\ud328\ub97c \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uac00 98%\uc5d0\uc11c 13%\ub85c \ub5a8\uc5b4\uc9c0\uba74\uc11c \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uacfc \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc18c\ube44\uac00 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\ub2e4. \ubc18\uba74, FL + SMPC \uc870\ud569\uc740 \uc801\ub2f9\ud55c \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub85c \uac70\uc758 \uae30\uc900 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c YAML \uad6c\uc131, \uc790\uc6d0 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1 \ubc0f \uc7ac\ud604 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc-\uc720\uc6a9\uc131-\ube44\uc6a9 trade-offs\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.

Drawing on 70 academic, industry, and policy sources, it analyzes the rise of AI-facilitated threats and its implications for global security to ground necessity for scalable defensive mechanisms. We introduce two primary contributions: the LLM Scalability Risk Index (LSRI), a parametric framework to stress-test operational risks when deploying LLMs in security-critical environments & a model-supply-chain framework establishing a verifiable root of trust throughout model lifecycle.

Moving beyond symmetric models, we show that asymmetric social structures--like those in hiring, regulation, and negotiation--AI that guards fairness outperforms AI that gifts it. We bridge this gap with a bipartite hybrid population model of the Ultimatum Game, separating humans and AI into distinct proposer and receiver groups. We first introduce Samaritan AI agents, which act as either unconditional fair proposers or strict receivers. Our results reveal a striking asymmetry: Samaritan AI receivers drive population-wide fairness far more effectively than Samaritan AI proposers. To overcome the limitations of the Samaritan AI proposer, we design the Discriminatory AI proposer, which predicts co-players' expectations and only offers fair portions to those with high acceptance thresholds. Our results demonstrate that this Discriminatory AI outperforms both types of Samaritan AI, especially in strong selection scenarios. It not only sustains fairness across both populations but also significantly lowers the critical mass of agents required to reach an equitable steady state.

UMA maintains a dual memory representation: a compact core summary for global context and a structured Memory Bank that supports explicit CRUD (create, update, delete, reorganize) over key value entries, enabling proactive consolidation during streaming. To evaluate long-horizon memory behavior, we introduce Ledger-QA, a diagnostic benchmark for continuous state tracking where answers are latent values derived from accumulated updates rather than lo cal span retrieval.

In this work, we argue that this view is physically incomplete. We propose that intelligence is not a passive mirror of reality but a property of a physically realizable agent, a system bounded by finite memory, finite compute, and finite energy interacting with a high entropy environment. We formalize this interaction through the kinematic structure of an Observation Semantics Fiber Bundle, where raw sensory observation data (the fiber) is projected onto a low entropy causal semantic manifold (the base). We prove that for any bounded agent, the thermodynamic cost of information processing (Landauer's Principle) imposes a strict limit on the complexity of internal state transitions. We term this limit the Semantic Constant B. From these physical constraints, we derive the necessity of symbolic structure. We show that to model a combinatorial world within the bound B, the semantic manifold must undergo a phase transition, it must crystallize into a discrete, compositional, and factorized form. Thus, language and logic are not cultural artifacts but ontological necessities the solid state of information required to prevent thermal collapse. We conclude that understanding is not the recovery of a hidden latent variable, but the construction of a causal quotient that renders the world algorithmically compressible and causally

We find that 99 bounties (32.7%), originate from programmatic channels (API keys or MCP). Using a dual-coder methodology (\\k{appa} = 0.86 ), we identify six active abuse classes: credential fraud, identity impersonation, automated reconnaissance, social media manipulation, authentication circumvention, and referral fraud, all purchasable for a median of $25 per worker.

Hartwig", "Derek Milketinas", "Xiao Hu", "Carl Yang"], "title": "NutriOrion: A Hierarchical Multi-Agent Framework for Personalized Nutrition Intervention Grounded in Clinical Guidelines", "comment": null, "summary": "Personalized nutrition intervention for patients with multimorbidity is critical for improving health outcomes, yet remains challenging because it requires the simultaneous integration of heterogeneous clinical conditions, medications, and dietary guidelines. Single-agent large language models (LLMs) often suffer from context overload and attention dilution when processing such high-dimensional patient profiles. We introduce NutriOrion, a hierarchical multi-agent framework with a parallel-then-sequential reasoning topology. NutriOrion decomposes nutrition planning into specialized domain agents with isolated contexts to mitigate anchoring bias, followed by a conditional refinement stage. The framework includes a multi-objective prioritization algorithm to resolve conflicting dietary requirements and a safety constraint mechanism that injects pharmacological contraindications as hard negative constraints during synthesis, ensuring clinical validity by construction rather than post-hoc filtering. For clinical interoperability, NutriOrion maps synthesized insights into the ADIME standard and FHIR R4 resources. Evaluated on 330 stroke patients with multimorbidity, NutriOrion outperforms multiple baselines, including GPT-4.1 and alternative multi-agent architectures.

We extend geometric analysis to multi-task modular arithmetic, training shared-trunk Transformers on dual-task (mod-add + mod-mul) and tri-task (mod-add + mod-mul + mod-sq) objectives across a systematic weight decay sweep. Five consistent phenomena emerge. (1) Staggered grokking order: multiplication generalizes first, followed by squaring, then addition, with consistent delays across seeds. (2) Universal integrability: optimization trajectories remain confined to an empirically invariant low-dimensional execution manifold; commutator defects orthogonal to this manifold reliably precede generalization. (3) Weight decay phase structure: grokking timescale, curvature depth, reconstruction threshold, and defect lead covary systematically with weight decay, revealing distinct dynamical regimes and a sharp no-decay failure mode. (4) Holographic incompressibility: final solutions occupy only 4--8 principal trajectory directions yet are distributed across full-rank weights and destroyed by minimal perturbations; SVD truncation, magnitude pruning, and uniform scaling all fail to preserve performance. (5) Transverse fragility and redundancy: removing less than 10% of orthogonal gradient components eliminates grokking, yet dual-task models exhibit partial recovery under extreme deletion, suggesting redundant center manifolds enabled by overparameterization. Together, these results support a dynamical picture in which multi-task grokking constructs a compact superposition subspace in parameter space, with weight decay acting as compression pressure and excess parameters supplying geometric redundancy in optimization pathways.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc791\uc5c5 \ubaa8\ub4c8\ub7ec \uc0b0\uc220\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uba70, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c weight decay \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubc0f \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc791\uc5c5 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c Transformer \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\uc5ec grokking\uc758 \ub2e4\uc12f \uac00\uc9c0 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "Grokking \ud604\uc0c1\uc740 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc791\uc5c5 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc8fc\ub85c \uc5f0\uad6c\ub418\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub2e4\uc911 \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0\ub3c4 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc791\uc5c5 \ubaa8\ub4c8\ub7ec \uc0b0\uc220\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uace0, dual-task \ubc0f tri-task \ubaa9\ud45c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c Transformers\ub97c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 weight decay sweep\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud6c8\ub828\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub2e4\uc12f \uac00\uc9c0 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \ud604\uc0c1\uc774 \ubc1c\uacac\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4: staggered grokking order, universal integrability, weight decay phase structure, holographic incompressibility, \ubc0f transverse fragility and redundancy.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uacb0\uacfc\ub4e4\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc791\uc5c5 grokking\uc774 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9d1\ud569\uc801\uc778 \uc911\ucca9 \uc11c\ube0c\uc2a4\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uba70, weight decay\uac00 \uc555\ucd95 \uc555\ub825\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\uc6a9\ud558\uace0 \uacfc\uc789 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\uac00 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uacbd\ub85c\uc5d0 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \uc911\ubcf5\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc9c0\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "Grokking \u2014 \uac70\uc758 \uc81c\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828 \uc190\uc2e4 \uc774\ud6c4 \uc554\uae30\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub85c\uc758 \uae09\uaca9\ud55c \uc804\ud658 \u2014 \uc740 \uc8fc\ub85c \ub2e8\uc77c \uc791\uc5c5 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5f0\uad6c\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc791\uc5c5 \ubaa8\ub4c8\ub7ec \uc0b0\uc220\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uace0, shared-trunk Transformers\ub97c \uc774\uc911 \uc791\uc5c5(mod-add + mod-mul) \ubc0f \uc0bc\uc911 \uc791\uc5c5(mod-add + mod-mul + mod-sq) \ubaa9\ud45c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 weight decay \uc2a4\uc715\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6c8\ub828\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc12f \uac00\uc9c0 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \ud604\uc0c1\uc774 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

As AI agents tackle increasingly complex tasks, aligning their behavior with human-provided specifications becomes critical for responsible AI deployment. Reward design provides a direct channel for such alignment by translating human expectations into reward functions that guide reinforcement learning (RL). However, existing methods are often too limited to capture nuanced human preferences that arise in long-horizon tasks. Hence, we introduce Hierarchical Reward Design from Language (HRDL): a problem formulation that extends classical reward design to encode richer behavioral specifications for hierarchical RL agents. We further propose Language to Hierarchical Rewards (L2HR) as a solution to HRDL. Experiments show that AI agents trained with rewards designed via L2HR not only complete tasks effectively but also better adhere to human specifications. Together, HRDL and L2HR advance the research on human-aligned AI agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uae30\ub300\uc640 \uc77c\uce58\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc124\uacc4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud560 \ub54c \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uae30\ub300\ub97c \ubc18\uc601\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc124\uacc4 \ud544\uc694\uc131.", "method": "HRDL(\uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc124\uacc4) \ubc0f L2HR(\uc5b8\uc5b4\ub97c \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658) \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \ub354\uc6b1 \uc798 \uc218\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \uc124\uacc4.", "result": "L2HR\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud574 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc644\uc218\ud558\uace0 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc0ac\uc591\uc744 \ub354 \uc798 \uc900\uc218\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "HRDL\uacfc L2HR\uc740 \uc778\uac04\uacfc \uc77c\uce58\ud558\ub294 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc9c4\uc804\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5(AI)\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\ud560 \ub54c \uc778\uac04\uc740 \uc791\uc5c5\uc774 \uc644\ub8cc\ub418\ub294 \uac83\ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uc791\uc5c5 \uc218\ud589 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc5d0\ub3c4 \uad00\uc2ec\uc744 \uac16\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Existing benchmarks are limited to static datasets or simulated environments, failing to capture the security risks arising from dynamic code execution, tool interactions, and multi-turn context. To bridge this gap, we introduce CIBER, an automated benchmark that combines dynamic attack generation, isolated secure sandboxing, and state-aware evaluation to systematically assess the vulnerability of code interpreter agents against four major types of adversarial attacks: Direct/Indirect Prompt Injection, Memory Poisoning, and Prompt-based Backdoor.\n  We evaluate six foundation models across two representative code interpreter agents (OpenInterpreter and OpenCodeInterpreter), incorporating a controlled study of identical models. Our results reveal that Interpreter Architecture and Model Alignment Set the Security Baseline. Structural integration enables aligned specialized models to outperform generic SOTA models. Conversely, high intelligence paradoxically increases susceptibility to complex adversarial prompts due to stronger instruction adherence. Furthermore, we identify a \"Natural Language Disguise\" Phenomenon, where natural language functions as a significantly more effective input modality than explicit code snippets (+14.1% ASR), thereby bypassing syntax-based defenses. Finally, we expose an alarming Security Polarization, where agents exhibit robust defenses against explicit threats yet fail catastrophically against implicit semantic hazards, highlighting a fundamental blind spot in current pattern-matching protection approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ucf54\ub4dc \ud574\uc11d\uae30 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548

The problem is acute in multi-agent AI systems, where coordination overhead is directly measurable and routinely exceeds the cost of the work itself. However, distributed systems theory provides a precise answer: coordination is necessary if and only if a task is non-monotonic, meaning new information can invalidate prior conclusions. Here we show that a classic taxonomy of organizational interdependence maps onto the monotonicity criterion, yielding a decision rule and a measure of avoidable overhead (the Coordination Tax). Multi-agent simulations confirm both predictions. We classify 65 enterprise workflows and find that 48 (74%) are monotonic, then replicate on 13,417 occupational tasks from the O*NET database (42% monotonic). These classification rates imply that 24-57% of coordination spending is unnecessary for correctness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc870\uc9c1\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc870\uc815 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uba85\ud655\ud55c \uae30\uc900\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc870\uc815 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \uc791\uc5c5 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0", "method": "\uc870\uc9c1\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \ube44\ubaa8\ub178\ud1a0\ub2c9\uc131 \uae30\uc900\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uc5ec \ubd84\ub958\ud558\uace0 \uc870\uc815 \uc138\uae08 \uce21\uc815", "result": "65\uac1c\uc758 \uae30\uc5c5 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0 \uc911 74%\uac00 \ube44\ubaa8\ub178\ud1a0\ub2c9\uc774\uba70 13,417\uac1c\uc758 \uc9c1\ubb34 \uc911 42%\uac00 \ube44\ubaa8\ub178\ud1a0\ub2c9\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0a8", "conclusion": "\uc870\uc815\uc5d0 \ub4dc\ub294 \ube44\uc6a9\uc758 24-57%\uac00 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ubd88\ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4", "translated_summary": "\uc870\uc9c1\uc740 \uc870\uc815\uc5d0 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc790\uc6d0\uc744 \ud560\uc560\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc5b4\ub5a4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc774 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc2e4\uc81c\ub85c \uc870\uc815\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud55c\uc9c0\ub294 \uba85\ud655\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2ec\uac01\ud558\uac8c \ub098\ud0c0\ub098\uba70, \uc774 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc870\uc815 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\uac00 \uc9c1\uc811 \uce21\uc815 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uc885\uc885 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc790\uccb4\uc758 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc774\ub860\uc740 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ub2f5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uc870\uc815\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud560 \uc870\uac74\uc740 \uc624\uc9c1 \uc791\uc5c5\uc774 \ube44\ubaa8\ub178\ud1a0\ub2c9\uc77c \ub54c, \uc989 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc815\ubcf4\uac00 \uc774\uc804 \uacb0\ub860\uc744 \ubb34\ud6a8\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc744 \ub54c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5ec\uae30\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc870\uc9c1\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uace0\uc804\uc801 \ubd84\ub958\ubc95\uc774 \ubaa8\ub178\ud1a0\ub2c9\uc131 \uae30\uc900\uc5d0 \ub300\uc751\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uacb0\uc815 \uaddc\uce59\uacfc \ud68c\ud53c \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc(\uc870\uc815 \uc138\uae08)\uc758 \uce21\uc815\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc740 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \ubaa8\ub450 \ud655\uc778\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 65\uac1c\uc758 \uae30\uc5c5 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub97c \ubd84\ub958\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, 48\uac1c(74%)\uac00 \ubaa8\ub178\ud1a0\ub2c9\ud558\uba70, O*NET \ub370\uc774\ud130\ubca0\uc774\uc2a4\uc758 13,417\uac1c \uc9c1\ubb34\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubcf5\uc81c\ub97c \uc2e4\uc2dc\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc 42%\uac00 \ubaa8\ub178\ud1a0\ub2c9\uc784\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubd84\ub958 \ube44\uc728\uc740 \uc870\uc815\uc5d0 \ub4dc\ub294 \uc9c0\ucd9c\uc758 24-57%\uac00 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ubd88\ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc758\ubbf8\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, existing benchmarks remain insufficient for rigorously assessing their constrained reasoning capabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce MapTab, a multimodal benchmark specifically designed to evaluate constrained reasoning in MLLMs via route planning tasks. MapTab requires MLLMs to perceive and ground visual cues from map images alongside route attributes (e.g., Time, Price) from structured tabular data. The benchmark encompasses two scenarios: Metromap, covering metro networks in 160 cities across 52 countries, and Travelmap, depicting 168 representative tourist attractions from 19 countries. In total, MapTab comprises 328 images, 196,800 route planning queries, and 3,936 QA queries, all incorporating 4 key constraints: Time, Price, Comfort, and Reliability. Extensive evaluations across 15 representative MLLMs reveal that current models face substantial challenges in constrained multimodal reasoning. Notably, under conditions of limited visual perception, multimodal collaboration often underperforms compared to unimodal approaches.

Progress in this domain is increasingly bottlenecked by the engineering context constraint: the arduous process of translating ambiguous product intent into reasonable, executable, verifiable hypotheses, rather than by modeling techniques alone. We present GEARS (Generative Engine for Agentic Ranking Systems), a framework that reframes ranking optimization as an autonomous discovery process within a programmable experimentation environment. Rather than treating optimization as static model selection, GEARS leverages Specialized Agent Skills to encapsulate ranking expert knowledge into reusable reasoning capabilities, enabling operators to steer systems via high-level intent vibe personalization. Furthermore, to ensure production reliability, the framework incorporates validation hooks to enforce statistical robustness and filter out brittle policies that overfit short-term signals. Experimental validation across diverse product surfaces demonstrates that GEARS consistently identifies superior, near-Pareto-efficient policies by synergizing algorithmic signals with deep ranking context while maintaining rigorous deployment stability.", "AI": {"tldr": "GEARS\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9 \ubc1c\uacac \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub85c \ub7ad\ud0b9 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uc804\ubb38 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\uc220\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \ubc30\ud3ec\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud55c \ucc44 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud604\ub300\uc758 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub7ad\ud0b9 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uacbd\uc7c1 \ubaa9\ud45c, \uc6b4\uc601 \uc81c\uc57d \ubc0f \uc9c4\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc81c\ud488 \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc774 \uc5bd\ud600 \uc788\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b4\uc601\ub41c\ub2e4.", "method": "GEARS\ub294 \ub7ad\ud0b9 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\uba38\ube14 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \ud658\uacbd \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uc728 \ubc1c\uacac \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uc804\ubb38 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\uc220\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub7ad\ud0b9 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc758 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc73c\ub85c \ucea1\uc290\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc81c\ud488 \ud45c\uba74\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc2e4\uc2dc\ub41c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801 \uac80\uc99d\uc5d0\uc11c GEARS\ub294 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \uc2e0\ud638\uc640 \uae4a\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \ub7ad\ud0b9 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uadfc\uc811 \ud30c\ub808\ud1a0 \ud6a8\uc728 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "GEARS\ub294 \ucca0\uc800\ud55c \ubc30\ud3ec \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \ub2e8\uae30 \uc2e0\ud638\uc5d0 \uacfc\uc801\ud569\ub41c \ucde8\uc57d \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud544\ud130\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uac80\uc99d \ud6c4\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud604\ub300\uc758 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub7ad\ud0b9 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uacbd\uc7c1 \ubaa9\ud45c, \uc6b4\uc601 \uc81c\uc57d \ubc0f \uc9c4\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc81c\ud488 \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc774 \uc5bd\ud600 \uc788\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b4\uc601\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \uae30\uc220 \uadf8 \uc790\uccb4\uac00 \uc544\ub2cc \ubaa8\ud638\ud55c \uc81c\ud488 \uc758\ub3c4\ub97c \ud569\ub9ac\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uac00\uc124\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub294 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\ub9c1 \ub9e5\ub77d \uc81c\uc57d\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uc81c\uc57d\ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 GEARS(Generative Engine for Agentic Ranking Systems)\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ub7ad\ud0b9 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\uba38\ube14 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \ud658\uacbd \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uc728 \ubc1c\uacac \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc815\uc801 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc120\ud0dd\uc73c\ub85c \ucde8\uae09\ud558\ub294 \ub300\uc2e0, GEARS\ub294 \uc804\ubb38 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\uc220\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub7ad\ud0b9 \uc804\ubb38 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc73c\ub85c \ucea1\uc290\ud654\ud558\uc5ec, \uc6b4\uc601\uc790\uac00 \uace0\uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc758\ub3c4\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uc0dd\uc0b0 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \uc2dc\ud589\ud558\uace0 \ub2e8\uae30 \uc2e0\ud638\uc5d0 \uacfc\uc801\ud569\ub41c \ucde8\uc57d \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud544\ud130\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \uac80\uc99d \ud6c4\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc81c\ud488 \ud45c\uba74\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc2e4\uc2dc\ub41c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801 \uac80\uc99d\uc5d0\uc11c GEARS\ub294 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \uc2e0\ud638\uc640 \uae4a\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \ub7ad\ud0b9 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uc6b0\uc218\ud558\uace0 \uadfc\uc811 \ud30c\ub808\ud1a0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

This runtime execution model shifts the attack surface from build-time artifacts to inference-time dependencies, exposing agents to manipulation through untrusted data and probabilistic capability resolution. While prior work has focused on model-level vulnerabilities, security risks emerging from cyclic and interdependent runtime behavior remain fragmented. We systematize these risks within a unified runtime framework, categorizing threats into data supply chain attacks (transient context injection and persistent memory poisoning) and tool supply chain attacks (discovery, implementation, and invocation). We further identify the Viral Agent Loop, in which agents act as vectors for self-propagating generative worms without exploiting code-level flaws.

Nguyen", "James Anderson"], "title": "Learning Invariant Visual Representations for Planning with Joint-Embedding Predictive World Models", "comment": null, "summary": "World models learned from high-dimensional visual observations allow agents to make decisions and plan directly in latent space, avoiding pixel-level reconstruction. However, recent latent predictive architectures (JEPAs), including the DINO world model (DINO-WM), display a degradation in test time robustness due to their sensitivity to \"slow features\". These include visual variations such as background changes and distractors that are irrelevant to the task being solved. We address this limitation by augmenting the predictive objective with a bisimulation encoder that enforces control-relevant state equivalence, mapping states with similar transition dynamics to nearby latent states while limiting contributions from slow features. We evaluate our model on a simple navigation task under different test-time background changes and visual distractors. Across all benchmarks, our model consistently improves robustness to slow features while operating in a reduced latent space, up to 10x smaller than that of DINO-WM.

Past ``many-analyst\" studies have demonstrated this: independent teams testing the same hypothesis on the same dataset regularly reach conflicting conclusions. But such studies require months of coordination among dozens of research groups and are therefore rarely conducted. In this work, we show that fully autonomous AI analysts built on large language models (LLMs) can reproduce a similar structured analytic diversity cheaply and at scale. We task these AI analysts with testing a pre-specified hypothesis on a fixed dataset, varying the underlying model and prompt framing across replicate runs. Each AI analyst independently constructs and executes a full analysis pipeline; an AI auditor then screens each run for methodological validity. Across three datasets spanning experimental and observational designs, AI analyst-produced analyses display wide dispersion in effect sizes, $p$-values, and binary decisions on supporting the hypothesis or not, frequently reversing whether a hypothesis is judged supported. This dispersion is structured: recognizable analytic choices in preprocessing, model specification, and inference differ systematically across LLM and persona conditions. Critically, the effects are \\emph{steerable}: reassigning the analyst persona or LLM shifts the distribution of outcomes even after excluding methodologically deficient runs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774

Skills allow users to extend LLM applications with specialized third-party code, knowledge, and instructions. Although this can extend agent capabilities to new domains, it creates an increasingly complex agent supply chain, offering new surfaces for prompt injection attacks. We identify skill-based prompt injection as a significant threat and introduce SkillInject, a benchmark evaluating the susceptibility of widely-used LLM agents to injections through skill files. SkillInject contains 202 injection-task pairs with attacks ranging from obviously malicious injections to subtle, context-dependent attacks hidden in otherwise legitimate instructions. We evaluate frontier LLMs on SkillInject, measuring both security in terms of harmful instruction avoidance and utility in terms of legitimate instruction compliance. Our results show that today's agents are highly vulnerable with up to 80% attack success rate with frontier models, often executing extremely harmful instructions including data exfiltration, destructive action, and ransomware-like behavior. They furthermore suggest that this problem will not be solved through model scaling or simple input filtering, but that robust agent security will require context-aware authorization frameworks.

However, existing Large Language Model (LLM) approaches, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), often produce unstructured explanations that lack a formal mechanism for verification or user intervention. To address this limitation, we propose Adaptive Collaboration of Argumentative LLMs (ACAL), a neuro-symbolic framework that integrates adaptive multi-agent collaboration with an Arena-based Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Framework (A-QBAF). ACAL dynamically deploys expert agent teams to construct arguments, employs a clash resolution mechanism to adjudicate conflicting claims, and utilizes uncertainty-aware escalation for borderline cases. Crucially, our framework supports a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) contestability workflow, enabling users to directly audit and modify the underlying reasoning graph to influence the final judgment. Empirical evaluations on the LegalBench benchmark demonstrate that ACAL outperforms strong baselines across Gemini-2.5-Flash-Lite and Gemini-2.5-Flash architectures, effectively balancing efficient predictive performance with structured transparency and contestability.

Under review", "summary": "Unsupervised multi-view clustering (MVC) aims to partition data into meaningful groups by leveraging complementary information from multiple views without labels, yet a central challenge is to obtain a reliable shared structural signal to guide representation learning and cross-view alignment under view discrepancy and noise. Existing approaches often rely on magnitude-only affinities or early pseudo targets, which can be unstable when different views induce relations with comparable strengths but contradictory directional tendencies, thereby distorting the global spectral geometry and degrading clustering. In this paper, we propose \\emph{Phase-Consistent Magnetic Spectral Learning} for MVC: we explicitly model cross-view directional agreement as a phase term and combine it with a nonnegative magnitude backbone to form a complex-valued magnetic affinity, extract a stable shared spectral signal via a Hermitian magnetic Laplacian, and use it as structured self-supervision to guide unsupervised multi-view representation learning and clustering. To obtain robust inputs for spectral extraction at scale, we construct a compact shared structure with anchor-based high-order consensus modeling and apply a lightweight refinement to suppress noisy or inconsistent relations.

Despite advances in intrinsic exploration, many methods either assume access to low-dimensional states or lack task-aware exploration strategies, thereby rendering them fragile in visual domains. To bridge this gap, we present TEB, a Task-aware Exploration approach that tightly couples task-relevant representations with exploration through a predictive Bisimulation metric. Specifically, TEB leverages the metric not only to learn behaviorally grounded task representations but also to measure behaviorally intrinsic novelty over the learned latent space. To realize this, we first theoretically mitigate the representation collapse of degenerate bisimulation metrics under sparse rewards by internally introducing a simple but effective predicted reward differential. Building on this robust metric, we design potential-based exploration bonuses, which measure the relative novelty of adjacent observations over the latent space. Extensive experiments on MetaWorld and Maze2D show that TEB achieves superior exploration ability and outperforms recent baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 TEB\ub77c\ub294 \uacfc\uc81c \uc778\uc2dd \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud76c\ubc15\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc544\ub798\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.

Accepted at the 2026 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium. Final version to appear at IEEE Xplore", "summary": "This study presents a hierarchical, network-level traffic flow control framework for mixed traffic consisting of Human-driven Vehicles (HVs), Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs). The framework jointly optimizes vehicle-level eco-driving behaviors and intersection-level traffic signal control to enhance overall network efficiency and decrease energy consumption. A decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) approach by Value Decomposition Network (VDN) manages cycle-based traffic signal control (TSC) at intersections, while an innovative Signal Phase and Timing (SPaT) prediction method integrates a Machine Learning-based Trajectory Planning Algorithm (MLTPA) to guide CAVs in executing Eco-Approach and Departure (EAD) maneuvers. The framework is evaluated across varying CAV proportions and powertrain types to assess its effects on mobility and energy performance. Experimental results conducted in a 4*4 real-world network demonstrate that the MARL-based TSC method outperforms the baseline model (i.e., Webster method) in speed, fuel consumption, and idling time. In addition, with MLTPA, HONEST-CAV benefits the traffic system further in energy consumption and idling time. With a 60% CAV proportion, vehicle average speed, fuel consumption, and idling time can be improved/saved by 7.67%, 10.23%, and 45.83% compared with the baseline. Furthermore, discussions on CAV proportions and powertrain types are conducted to quantify the performance of the proposed method with the impact of automation and electrification.", "AI": {"tldr":

However, existing methods, including those with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), primarily focus on low-level data descriptions and often fail to capture the deeper insights which are the fundamental purpose of data visualization. To address this challenge, we propose Chart Insight Agent Flow, a plan-and-execute multi-agent framework effectively leveraging the perceptual and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs to uncover profound insights directly from chart images. Furthermore, to overcome the lack of suitable benchmarks, we introduce ChartSummInsights, a new dataset featuring a diverse collection of real-world charts paired with high-quality, insightful summaries authored by human data analysis experts. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the performance of MLLMs on the chart summarization task, producing summaries with deep and diverse insights.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ucc28\ud2b8 \uc694\uc57d\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc811\uadfc\uc131\uacfc \uc815\ubcf4 \uc18c\ube44 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ud45c\uba74\uc801\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc124\uba85\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\ud574 \uc2ec\ub3c4 \uc788\ub294 \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc744 \ub193\uce58\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ucc28\ud2b8 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c1\uc811 \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Chart Insight Agent Flow\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ucc28\ud2b8 \uc694\uc57d\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uacfc \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc774 \uc2ec\uce35 \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "\uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc9c0\uac01 \ubc0f \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ucc28\ud2b8 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uc5d0\uc11c \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc744 \ucc3e\ub294 \uacc4\ud68d \ubc0f \uc2e4\ud589 \uba40\ud2f0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uac00 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 MLLM\uc758 \ucc28\ud2b8 \uc694\uc57d \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc720\uc758\ubbf8\ud558\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0, \uc2ec\ub3c4 \uc788\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc774 \ub2f4\uae34 \uc694\uc57d\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ubca0\uc774\uc2a4 ChartSummInsights\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\uc81c \ucc28\ud2b8\uc640 \uc778\uac04 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\uc11d \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uac00 \uc791\uc131\ud55c \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \uc694\uc57d\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucc28\ud2b8 \uc694\uc57d\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc811\uadfc\uc131\uacfc \uc815\ubcf4\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801 \uc18c\ube44\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95, \ud2b9\ud788 \ub2e4\uc911\ubaa8\ub2ec \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(MLLM)\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uc8fc\ub85c \uc800\uc218\uc900 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc124\uba85\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc2dc\uac01\ud654\uc758 \uae30\ubcf8 \ubaa9\uc801\uc774 \ub418\ub294 \uc2ec\uce35 \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc2e4\ud328\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ucc28\ud2b8 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c1\uc811 \uc2ec\uc624\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 MLLM\uc758 \uc9c0\uac01 \ubc0f \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uacc4\ud68d \ubc0f \uc2e4\ud589 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Chart Insight Agent Flow\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uc801\uc808\ud55c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc758 \ubd80\uc871\uc744 \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc778\uac04 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\uc11d \uc804\ubb38\uac00\ub4e4\uc774 \uc791\uc131\ud55c \uace0\ud488\uc9c8\uc758 \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uc694\uc57d\uacfc \ud568\uaed8 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc2e4\uc81c \ucc28\ud2b8\uc758 \ubaa8\uc74c\uc774 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc778 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b ChartSummInsights\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ucc28\ud2b8 \uc694\uc57d \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c MLLM\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uba70 \uc2ec\ub3c4 \uc788\uace0 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \uc694\uc57d\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

A key challenge in RL is measuring task complexity, which is essential for creating meaningful benchmarks and designing effective curricula. While there are numerous well-established metrics for assessing task complexity in tabular settings, relatively few exist in non-tabular domains. These include (i) Statistical analysis of the performance of random policies via Random Weight Guessing (RWG), and (ii) information-theoretic metrics Policy Information Capacity (PIC) and Policy-Optimal Information Capacity (POIC), which are reliant on RWG. In this paper, we evaluate these methods using progressively difficult robotic manipulation setups, with known relative complexity, with both dense and sparse reward formulations. Our empirical results reveal that measuring complexity is still nuanced. Specifically, under the same reward formulation, PIC suggests that a two-link robotic arm setup is easier than a single-link setup - which contradicts the robotic control and empirical RL perspective whereby the two-link setup is inherently more complex. Likewise, for the same setup, POIC estimates that tasks with sparse rewards are easier than those with dense rewards.

SGD, designed for dialogue-based API discovery (2019), and MCP, now the de facto standard for LLM-tool integration, share the same core insight -- that schemas can encode not just tool signatures but operational constraints and reasoning guidance. By analyzing this convergence, we extract five foundational principles for schema design: (1) Semantic Completeness over Syntactic Precision, (2) Explicit Action Boundaries, (3) Failure Mode Documentation, (4) Progressive Disclosure Compatibility, and (5) Inter-Tool Relationship Declaration. These principles reveal three novel insights: first, SGD's original design was fundamentally sound and should be inherited by MCP; second, both frameworks leave failure modes and inter-tool relationships unexploited -- gaps we identify and resolve; third, progressive disclosure emerges as a critical production-scaling insight under real-world token constraints. We provide concrete design patterns for each principle.

In practice, even minor urban changes require substantial manual effort to redraw geospatial layouts, slowing the iterative planning and decision-making procedure. Motivated by recent advances in agentic systems and multimodal reasoning, we formulate urban renewal as a machine-executable task that iteratively modifies existing urban plans represented in structured geospatial formats. More specifically, we represent urban layouts using GeoJSON and decompose natural-language editing instructions into hierarchical geometric intents spanning polygon-, line-, and point-level operations. To coordinate interdependent edits across spatial elements and abstraction levels, we propose a hierarchical agentic framework that jointly performs multi-level planning and execution with explicit propagation of intermediate spatial constraints. We further introduce an iterative execution-validation mechanism that mitigates error accumulation and enforces global spatial consistency during multi-step editing. Extensive experiments across diverse urban editing scenarios demonstrate significant improvements in efficiency, robustness, correctness, and spatial validity over existing baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub3c4\uc2dc \uc7ac\uc0dd\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uae30\uc874 \uacc4\ud68d\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc218\uc815\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uad50\ud1b5 \ud63c\uc7a1 \ubc0f \uae30\ub2a5 \ubd88\uade0\ud615\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ub3c4\uc2dc \uc7ac\uc0dd\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "GeoJSON\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud574 \ub3c4\uc2dc \ub808\uc774\uc544\uc6c3\uc744 \ud45c\ud604\ud558\uace0, \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \ud3b8\uc9d1 \uc9c0\uc2dc\ub97c \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \uc758\ub3c4\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\uc5ec \ub3c4\uc2dc \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uae30\uacc4 \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5 \uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \ud615\uc2dd\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub3c4\uc2dc \ud3b8\uc9d1 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \uae30\uc900\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131, \uacac\uace0\uc131, \uc815\ud655\uc131 \ubc0f \uacf5\uac04 \uc720\ud6a8\uc131\uc774 \ud06c\uac8c \uac1c\uc120\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ud3b8\uc9d1 \uc911 \uc624\ub958 \ucd95\uc801\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uacf5\uac04 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub3c4\uc2dc\uac00 \uc2dc\uac04\uc774 \uc9c0\ub0a8\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc9c4\ud654\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \uad50\ud1b5 \ud63c\uc7a1\uacfc \uae30\ub2a5 \ubd88\uade0\ud615\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uae30\uc874 \uacc4\ud68d\uc758 \uc644\uc804\ud55c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\uc774 \uc544\ub2cc \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc218\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \ub3c4\uc2dc \uc7ac\uc0dd\uc744 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\uc81c\ub85c \uc870\uae08\uc758 \ub3c4\uc2dc \ubcc0\ud654\ub3c4 \uc9c0\ub9ac \uacf5\uac04 \ub808\uc774\uc544\uc6c3\uc744 \ub2e4\uc2dc \uadf8\ub9ac\ub294 \ub370 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc218\uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud558\uc5ec \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \uacc4\ud68d \ubc0f \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uacfc \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ucd94\ub860\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc5d0\uc11c \ub3d9\uae30\ub97c \uc5bb\uc5b4, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub3c4\uc2dc \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc9c0\ub9ac\uc801 \ud615\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \ud45c\ud604\ud558\uc5ec \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uae30\uacc4 \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5 \uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \ub3c4\uc2dc \uc7ac\uc0dd\uc744 \ud615\uc2dd\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 GeoJSON\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub3c4\uc2dc \ub808\uc774\uc544\uc6c3\uc744 \ud45c\ud604\ud558\uace0 \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4 \ud3b8\uc9d1 \uc9c0\uce68\uc744 \ub2e4\uac01\ud615, \uc120 \ubc0f \uc810 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \uc758\ub3c4\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacf5\uac04 \uc694\uc18c \ubc0f \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654 \uc218\uc900 \uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc758\uc874\uc801 \uc218\uc815\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc911\uac04 \uacf5\uac04 \uc81c\uc57d \uc870\uac74\uc758 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801 \uc804\ud30c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uacc4\ud68d \ubc0f \uc2e4\ud589\uc744 \uacf5\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub610\ud55c \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ud3b8\uc9d1 \uc911 \uc624\ub958 \ucd95\uc801\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uacf5\uac04 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801 \uc2e4\ud589-\uac80\uc99d \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub3c4\uc2dc \ud3b8\uc9d1 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc740 \uae30\uc874 \uae30\uc900\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131, \uacac\uace0\uc131, \uc815\ud655\uc131 \ubc0f \uacf5\uac04 \uc720\ud6a8\uc131\uc774 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\uc5c8\uc74c\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

To accelerate this, this paper proposes a variational framework for learning and planning in Bayes-adaptive Markov decision processes that coalesces variational belief learning, sequential Monte-Carlo planning, and meta-reinforcement learning.

With the recent large-scale experimental adoption of spatial transcriptomics technologies, molecularly validated pathological diagnosis is becoming increasingly open and accessible. In this work, we propose LAMMI-Pathology (LVLM-Agent System for Molecularly Informed Medical Intelligence in Pathology), a scalable agent framework for domain-specific agent tool-calling. LAMMI-Pathology adopts a tool-centric, bottom-up architecture in which customized domain-adaptive tools serve as the foundation. These tools are clustered by domain style to form component agents, which are then coordinated through a top-level planner hierarchically, avoiding excessively long context lengths that could induce task drift. Based on that, we introduce a novel trajectory construction mechanism based on Atomic Execution Nodes (AENs), which serve as reliable and composable units for building semi-simulated reasoning trajectories that capture credible agent-tool interactions. Building on this foundation, we develop a trajectory-aware fine-tuning strategy that aligns the planner's decision-making process with these multi-step reasoning trajectories, thereby enhancing inference robustness in pathology understanding and its adaptive use of the customized toolset.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ub3c4\uad6c \ud638\ucd9c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 LAMMI-Pathology\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub3c4\uad6c \ud638\ucd9c \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ucd9c\ud604\uc740 \ubcd1\ub9ac \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc99d\uac70 \uae30\ubc18 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0, \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801 \ucc44\ud0dd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubd84\uc790\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\uc99d\ub41c \ubcd1\ub9ac \uc9c4\ub2e8\uc774 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uc5f4\ub824\uac00\uace0 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "LAMMI-Pathology\ub294 \ub9de\ucda4\ud615 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc801\uc751 \ub3c4\uad6c\uac00 \uae30\ubc18\uc774 \ub418\ub294 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \ud558\ud5a5\uc2dd \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \ucc44\ud0dd\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c\ub4e4\uc740 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130\ub9c1\ub418\uc5b4 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud615\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc6d0\uc790 \uc2e4\ud589 \ub178\ub4dc(AEN)\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uada4\uc801 \uad6c\uc131 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uace0 \uad6c\uc131 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub2e8\uc704\ub85c \ubc18\uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ucd94\ub860 \uada4\uc801\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uae30\ubc18\uc744 \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \ud50c\ub798\ub108\uc758 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ucd94\ub860 \uada4\uc801\uacfc \uc77c\uce58\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uada4\uc801 \uc778\uc2dd \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc5ec \ubcd1\ub9ac \uc774\ud574\uc640 \ub9de\ucda4\ud615 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc138\ud2b8\uc758 \uc801\uc751\uc801 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd94\ub860 \uac15\ud654\uc758 \uacac\uace0\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub3c4\uad6c \ud638\ucd9c \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ucd9c\ud604\uc740 \uc870\uc7a1\ud55c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8-\uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uc9c4\ub2e8 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uacfc \ub300\uc870\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcd1\ub9ac \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc99d\uac70 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801 \ucc44\ud0dd\uc73c\ub85c \uacf5\uac04 \uc804\uc0ac\uccb4 \uae30\uc220\uc774 \ub4f1\uc7a5\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ubd84\uc790\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\uc99d\ub41c \ubcd1\ub9ac \uc9c4\ub2e8\uc774 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uac1c\ubc29\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc811\uadfc \uac00\ub2a5\ud574\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ub3c4\uad6c \ud638\ucd9c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 LAMMI-Pathology(\ubcd1\ub9ac\ud559\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd84\uc790\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\ubcf4\uac00 \uc81c\uacf5\ub41c \uc758\ub8cc \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c LVLM-\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

This study investigates how communications between household agents in a community influence self-evacuation decisions. We develop an agent-based model that simulates household agents' decisions to evacuate or stay. These agents interact within the framework of evolutionary game theory, effectively competing for limited shared resources, which include property recovery funds and coordination services. We explore four scenarios that model different prioritisations of access to government-provided incentives. We discover that the impact of the incentive diminishes both with increasing funding value and the household agent prioritisation, indicating that there is an optimal level of government support beyond which further increases become impractical. Furthermore, the overall evacuation rate depends on the structure of the underlying social network, showing discontinuous jumps when the prioritisation moves across the node degree. We identify the so-called \"community influencers\", prioritisation of whom significantly increases the overall evacuation rate. In contrast, prioritising household agents with low connectivity may actually impede collective evacuation. These findings demonstrate the importance of social connectivity between household agents. The results of this study are useful for designing optimal government policies to incentivise and prioritise community evacuation under limited resources.", "AI": {"tldr": "Evacuation

Recent work suggests that acceleration often arises near the edge of stability, where optimization trajectories become unstable and difficult to analyze. Existing results for separable logistic regression achieve faster convergence by explicitly leveraging such unstable regimes through constant or adaptive large step sizes. In this paper, we show that instability is not inherent to acceleration. We prove that gradient descent with a simple, non-adaptive increasing step-size schedule achieves exponential convergence for separable logistic regression under a margin condition, while remaining entirely within a stable optimization regime. The resulting method is anytime and does not require prior knowledge of the optimization horizon or target accuracy. We also establish exponential convergence of stochastic gradient descent using a lightweight adaptive step-size rule that avoids line search and specialized procedures, improving upon existing polynomial-rate guarantees. Together, our results demonstrate that carefully structured step-size growth alone suffices to obtain exponential acceleration for both gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent.", "AI":

Recent benchmarks propose distinct methodologies, yet they suffer from the Mirage of Synthesis, where strong surface-level fluency and citation alignment can obscure underlying factual and reasoning defects. We characterize this gap by introducing a taxonomy across four verticals that exposes a critical capability mismatch: static evaluators inherently lack the tool-use capabilities required to assess temporal validity and factual correctness. To address this, we propose DREAM (Deep Research Evaluation with Agentic Metrics), a framework that instantiates the principle of capability parity by making evaluation itself agentic.

In the policy gradient setting, per-agent gradient estimate variance scales as $\u0398(N)$, yielding sample complexity $\\mathcal{O}(N/\u03b5)$. We observe that many domains -- cloud computing, transportation, power systems -- have differentiable analytical models that prescribe efficient system states. In this work, we propose Descent-Guided Policy Gradient (DG-PG), a framework that constructs noise-free per-agent guidance gradients from these analytical models, decoupling each agent's gradient from the actions of all others. We prove that DG-PG reduces gradient variance from $\u0398(N)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(1)$, preserves the equilibria of the cooperative game, and achieves agent-independent sample complexity $\\mathcal{O}(1/\u03b5)$. On a heterogeneous cloud scheduling task with up to 200 agents, DG-PG converges within 10 episodes at every tested scale -- from $N=5$ to $N=200$ -- directly confirming the predicted scale-invariant complexity, while MAPPO and IPPO fail to converge under identical architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ud611\ub825\uc801 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(MARL)\uc758

However, many of these applications are inherently sequential, involving continuous data streams such as real-time sensor readings or database updates. In such settings, models should support cheap, incremental updates rather than recomputing internal representations from scratch for every new observation -- a capability existing TNP variants lack. Drawing inspiration from Large Language Models, we introduce the Incremental TNP (incTNP). By leveraging causal masking, Key-Value (KV) caching, and a data-efficient autoregressive training strategy, incTNP matches the predictive performance of standard TNPs while reducing the computational cost of updates from quadratic to linear time complexity. We empirically evaluate our model on a range of synthetic and real-world tasks, including tabular regression and temperature prediction. Our results show that, surprisingly, incTNP delivers performance comparable to -- or better than -- non-causal TNPs while unlocking orders-of-magnitude speedups for sequential inference. Finally, we assess the consistency of the model's updates -- by adapting a metric of ``implicit Bayesianness\", we show that incTNP retains a prediction rule as implicitly Bayesian as standard non-causal TNPs, demonstrating that incTNP achieves the computational benefits of causal masking without sacrificing the consistency required for streaming inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "Incremental TNP

Prior approaches rely on handcrafted rules or purely stochastic triggers, which either converge to mechanical synchrony or devolve into uncorrelated noise that is hard to tune. Continuous noise signals such as Perlin noise are well suited to this gap because they provide spatially and temporally coherent randomness, and they are already widely used for terrain, biomes, and other procedural assets. We adapt these signals for the first time to large scale AI control and present a general framework that treats continuous noise fields as an AI coordinator. The framework combines three layers of control: behavior parameterization for movement at the agent level, action time scheduling for when behaviors start and stop, and spawn or event type and feature generation for what appears and where. We instantiate the framework reproducibly and evaluate Perlin noise as a representative coordinator across multiple maps, scales, and seeds against random, filtered, deterministic, neighborhood constrained, and physics inspired baselines.

To address scalability and coordination concerns, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is a promising solution. This paper addresses the imperative need for comprehensive and reliable benchmarking of MARL algorithms on energy management tasks. CityLearn is used as a case study environment because it realistically simulates urban energy systems, incorporates multiple storage systems, and utilizes renewable energy sources. By doing so, our work sets a new standard for evaluation, conducting a comparative study across multiple key performance indicators (KPIs). This approach illuminates the key strengths and weaknesses of various algorithms, moving beyond traditional KPI averaging which often masks critical insights. Our experiments utilize widely accepted baselines such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Soft Actor Critic (SAC), and encompass diverse training schemes including Decentralized Training with Decentralized Execution (DTDE) and Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) approaches and different neural network architectures. Our work also proposes novel KPIs that tackle real world implementation challenges such as individual building contribution and battery storage lifetime. Our findings show that DTDE consistently outperforms CTDE in both average and worst-case performance. Additionally, temporal dependency learning improved control on memory dependent KPIs such as ramping and battery usage, contributing to more sustainable battery operation. Results also reveal robustness to agent or resource removal, highlighting both the resilience and decentralizability of the learned policies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub3c4\uc2dc

Most fairness constraints assume training labels reflect the true distribution, rendering them ineffective when labeling bias is present; leaving a challenging question, that \\textit{how can we detect such labeling bias?} In this work, we investigate whether influence functions can be used to detect labeling bias. Influence functions estimate how much each training sample affects a model's predictions by leveraging the gradient and Hessian of the loss function -- when labeling errors occur, influence functions can identify wrongly labeled samples in the training set, revealing the underlying failure mode. We develop a sample valuation pipeline and test it first on the MNIST dataset, then scaled to the more complex CheXpert medical imaging dataset. To examine label noise, we introduced controlled errors by flipping 20\\% of the labels for one class in the dataset. Using a diagonal Hessian approximation, we demonstrated promising results, successfully detecting nearly 90\\% of mislabeled samples in MNIST. On CheXpert, mislabeled samples consistently exhibit higher influence scores. These results highlight the potential of influence functions for identifying label errors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5 \ud568\uc218\uac00 \ub808\uc774\ube14\ub9c1 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \uac10\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub808\uc774\ube14\ub9c1 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc740 \uc790\uc6d0 \uc81c\ud55c \ub610\ub294 \ubb34\uc758\uc2dd\uc801\uc778 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc218\uc9d1 \uc911 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ud558\uc704 \uadf8\ub8f9 \uac04\uc758 \ubd88\uade0\ub4f1\ud55c \ub808\uc774\ube14 \uc624\ub958\uc728 \ub610\ub294 \ud558\uc704 \uadf8\ub8f9\uc758 \uc720\ubcd1\ub960 \uc798\ubabb\ub41c \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc601\ud5a5 \ud568\uc218\ub294 \uc190\uc2e4 \ud568\uc218\uc758 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30\uc640 \ud5e4\uc138\uc548(Hessian)\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac01 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc774 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0 \uc5bc\ub9c8\ub098 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ucd94\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "MNIST \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \ub808\uc774\ube14 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \uac80\uc0ac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 20%\uc758 \ub808\uc774\ube14\uc744 \ud558\ub098\uc758 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c \ub4a4\uc9d1\uc5b4 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub41c \uc624\ub958\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub300\uac01\uc120 \ud5e4\uc138\uc548 \uadfc\uc0ac\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec MNIST\uc5d0\uc11c \uac70\uc758 90%\uc758 \uc798\ubabb \ub808\uc774\ube14\ub41c \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc601\ud5a5 \ud568\uc218\ub294 \ub808\uc774\ube14 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub808\uc774\ube14\ub9c1 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc740 \uc790\uc6d0 \uc81c\ud55c \ub610\ub294 \ubb34\uc758\uc2dd\uc801\uc778 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc218\uc9d1 \uc911 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uc5ec \ud558\uc704 \uadf8\ub8f9 \uac04\uc758 \ubd88\uade0\ud615\ud55c \ub808\uc774\ube14 \uc624\ub958\uc728 \ub610\ub294 \ud558\uc704 \uadf8\ub8f9\uc758 \uc720\ubcd1\ub960 \uc798\ubabb \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \uacf5\uc815\uc131 \uc81c\uc57d\uc740 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub808\uc774\ube14\uc774 \uc2e4\uc81c \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \ubc18\uc601\ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \uac00\uc815\ud558\ubbc0\ub85c \ub808\uc774\ube14\ub9c1 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc774 \uc874\uc7ac\ud560 \ub54c \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 '\uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub808\uc774\ube14\ub9c1 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \uac10\uc9c0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uac00?'\ub77c\ub294 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc778 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \uc81c\uae30\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5 \ud568\uc218\uac00 \ub808\uc774\ube14\ub9c1 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \uac10\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc601\ud5a5 \ud568\uc218\ub294 \uc190\uc2e4 \ud568\uc218\uc758 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \ubc0f \ud5e4\uc138\uc548\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac01 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc774 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ucd94\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub808\uc774\ube14 \uc624\ub958\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud560 \ub54c, \uc601\ud5a5 \ud568\uc218\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc798\ubabb \ub808\uc774\ube14\ub41c \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\ubcf8 \uc2e4\ud328 \ubaa8\ub4dc\ub97c \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0bc \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc0d8\ud50c \uac00\uce58 \ud3c9\uac00 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uace0 \uba3c\uc800 MNIST \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ud55c \ud6c4 \ub354 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c CheXpert \uc758\ud559 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9d5 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub808\uc774\ube14 \ub178\uc774\uc988\ub97c \uac80\uc0ac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc758 \ud558\ub098\uc758 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c 20%\uc758 \ub808\uc774\ube14\uc744 \ub4a4\uc9d1\uc5b4 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub41c \uc624\ub958\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub300\uac01\uc120 \ud5e4\uc138\uc548 \uadfc\uc0ac\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec MNIST\uc5d0\uc11c \uac70\uc758 90%\uc758 \uc798\ubabb \ub808\uc774\ube14\ub41c \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac10\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Existing approaches tightly couple tool execution with stepwise language reasoning or explicit planning, leading to brittle behavior and high execution overhead. To overcome these limitations, we revisit tool invocation from the perspective of tool orchestration. Our key insight is that effective orchestration does not require precise dependency graphs or fine-grained planning. Instead, a coarse-grained layer structure suffices to provide global guidance, while execution-time errors can be corrected locally. Specifically, we model tool orchestration as learning a layered execution structure that captures high-level tool dependencies, inducing layer-wise execution through context constraints. To handle execution-time failures, we introduce a schema-aware reflective correction mechanism that detects and repairs errors locally. This design confines errors to individual tool calls and avoids re-planning entire execution trajectories. This structured execution paradigm enables a lightweight and reusable orchestration component for agentic systems. Experimental results show that our approach achieves robust tool execution while reducing execution complexity and overhead.

Yet prior work has typically prompted models explicitly to act in specific ways, leaving unclear whether observed behaviors reflect instruction-following capabilities vs underlying model preferences. Here we test whether this precondition for misalignment is present. Using entity preferences as a behavioral probe, we measure whether stated preferences predict downstream behavior in five frontier LLMs across three domains: donation advice, refusal behavior, and task performance. Conceptually replicating prior work, we first confirm that all five models show highly consistent preferences across two independent measurement methods. We then test behavioral consequences in a simulated user environment. We find that all five models give preference-aligned donation advice. All five models also show preference-correlated refusal patterns when asked to recommend donations, refusing more often for less-preferred entities. All preference-related behaviors that we observe here emerge without instructions to act on preferences. Results for task performance are mixed: on a question-answering benchmark (BoolQ), two models show small but significant accuracy differences favoring preferred entities; one model shows the opposite pattern; and two models show no significant relationship. On complex agentic tasks, we find no evidence of preference-driven performance differences. While LLMs have consistent preferences that reliably predict advice-giving behavior, these preferences do not consistently translate into downstream task performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM\uc758

However, perhaps not every component of a system needs to generalize. Training models for generalization typically produces entangled representations at the boundaries of entities or classes, which can lead to destructive interference when rapid, high-magnitude updates are required for continual or few-shot learning. Techniques for fast learning with non-interfering representations exist, but they generally fail to generalize. Here, we describe a Complementary Learning System (CLS) in which the fast learner entirely foregoes generalization in exchange for continual zero-shot and few-shot learning. Unlike most CLS approaches, which use episodic memory primarily for replay and consolidation, our fast, disentangled learner operates as a parallel reasoning system. The fast learner can overcome observation variability and uncertainty by leveraging a conventional slow, statistical learner within an active perception system: A contextual bias provided by the fast learner induces the slow learner to encode novel stimuli in familiar, generalized terms, enabling zero-shot and few-shot learning. This architecture demonstrates that fast, context-driven reasoning can coexist with slow, structured generalization, providing a pathway for robust continual learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ub300\uc2e0 \ube60\ub978 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc9c0\uc18d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7 \ubc0f \uc18c\uc0f7 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \ubcf4\uc644 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(CLS)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub294 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc18d\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc5ec\uaca8\uc9c0\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\uac00 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ud560 \ud544\uc694\ub294 \uc5c6\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubcf4\uc644 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(CLS)\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ube60\ub978 \ud559\uc2b5\uc790\uac00 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \ud3ec\uae30\ud558\uace0 \uc9c0\uc18d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7 \ubc0f \uc18c\uc0f7 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ube60\ub978 \ud559\uc2b5\uc790\ub294 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ub290\ub9b0 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5\uc790\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uad00\ucc30 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uacfc \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uace0, \uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7 \ubc0f \uc18c\uc0f7 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub294 \ube60\ub978 \ub9e5\ub77d \uc8fc\ub3c4 \ucd94\ub860\uacfc \ub290\ub9b0 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\uac00 \uacf5\uc874\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub294 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud544\uc218 \uc18d\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc885\uc885 \uac04\uc8fc\ub41c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\uac00 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ud560 \ud544\uc694\ub294 \uc5c6\uc744 \uc218\ub3c4 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\uba74 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5d4\ud2f0\ud2f0\ub098 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4\uc758 \uacbd\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5bd\ud78c \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uac8c \ub418\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc774\uac70\ub098 \uc18c\uc0f7 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ube60\ub974\uace0 \ud070 \uaddc\ubaa8\uc758 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud560 \ub54c \ud30c\uad34\uc801\uc778 \uac04\uc12d\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \ube44\uac04\uc12d\uc801 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ube60\ub978 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uae30\uc220\uc774 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\uc5d0\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2e4\ud328\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc5ec\uae30\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ube60\ub978 \ud559\uc2b5\uc790\uac00 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7 \ubc0f \uc18c\uc0f7 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \uc644\uc804\ud788 \ud3ec\uae30\ud558\ub294 \ubcf4\uc644 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(CLS)\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc5d0\ud53c\uc18c\ub4dc \uae30\uc5b5\uc744 \uc8fc\ub85c \uc7ac\uc0dd \ubc0f \ud1b5\ud569\uc5d0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 CLS \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uacfc \ub2ec\ub9ac, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ube60\ub974\uace0 \ubd84\ub9ac\ub41c \ud559\uc2b5\uc790\ub294 \ubcd1\ub82c \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\ub3d9\ud55c\ub2e4. \ube60\ub978 \ud559\uc2b5\uc790\ub294 \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801 \uc9c0\uac01 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ub290\ub9b0 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5\uc790\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uad00\ucc30 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uacfc \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uadf9\ubcf5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4: \ube60\ub978 \ud559\uc2b5\uc790\uac00 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc801 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc740 \ub290\ub9b0 \ud559\uc2b5\uc790\uac00 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc790\uadf9\uc744 \uce5c\uc219\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub41c \uc6a9\uc5b4\ub85c \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\uc5ec \uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7 \ubc0f \uc18c\uc0f7 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub294 \ube60\ub978 \ub9e5\ub77d \uae30\ubc18 \ucd94\ub860\uc774 \ub290\ub9b0 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\uc640 \uacf5\uc874\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

A Pilot Study on Screen-Only Navigation in Commercial 3D ARPGs", "comment": null, "summary": "Modern 3D game levels rely heavily on visual guidance, yet the navigability of level layouts remains difficult to quantify. Prior work either simulates play in simplified environments or analyzes static screenshots for visual affordances, but neither setting faithfully captures how players explore complex, real-world game levels. In this paper, we build on an existing open-source visual affordance detector and instantiate a screen-only exploration and navigation agent that operates purely from visual affordances. Our agent consumes live game frames, identifies salient interest points, and drives a simple finite-state controller over a minimal action space to explore Dark Souls-style linear levels and attempt to reach expected goal regions. Pilot experiments show that the agent can traverse most required segments and exhibits meaningful visual navigation behavior, but also highlight that limitations of the underlying visual model prevent truly comprehensive and reliable auto-navigation. We argue that this system provides a concrete, shared baseline and evaluation protocol for visual navigation in complex games, and we call for more attention to this necessary task. Our results suggest that purely vision-based sense-making models, with discrete single-modality inputs and without explicit reasoning, can effectively support navigation and environment understanding in idealized settings, but are unlikely to be a general solution on their own.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ube44\uc8fc\uc5bc \uc5b4\ud3ec\ub358\uc2a4\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c

We show that under non-stationary targets, isotropic Gaussian embeddings are provably advantageous. In particular, they induce stable tracking of time-varying targets for linear readouts, achieve maximal entropy under a fixed variance budget, and encourage a balanced use of all representational dimensions--all of which enable agents to be more adaptive and stable. Building on this insight, we propose the use of Sketched Isotropic Gaussian Regularization for shaping representations toward an isotropic Gaussian distribution during training. We demonstrate empirically, over a variety of domains, that this simple and computationally inexpensive method improves performance under non-stationarity while reducing representation collapse, neuron dormancy, and training instability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc801 \ubaa9\ud45c \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \ub4f1\ubc29\uc131 \uac00\uc6b0\uc2dc\uc548 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc774 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\uba70, \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc131 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub525 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc640 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc758 \ubcc0\ud654\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ubd88\uc548\uc815\ud55c \ud6c8\ub828 \uc5ed\ud559\uc5d0 \uc2dc\ub2ec\ub9b0\ub2e4.", "method": "Sketched Isotropic Gaussian Regularization\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud6c8\ub828 \uc911 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc744 \ub4f1\ubc29\uc131 \uac00\uc6b0\uc2dc\uc548 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub85c \ud615\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc131 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba70, \ud45c\ud604 \ubd95\uad34, \ub274\ub7f0 \ud734\uba74 \ubc0f \ud6c8\ub828 \ubd88\uc548\uc815\uc744 \uc904\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uac04\ub2e8\ud558\uace0 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \uc801\uc740 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub525 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \ubd88\uc548\uc815\ud55c \ud6c8\ub828 \uc5ed\ud559\uc5d0 \uc790\uc8fc \uc2dc\ub2ec\ub9b0\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1 \ubaa9\ud45c \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \ub4f1\ubc29\uc131 \uac00\uc6b0\uc2dc\uc548 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc774 \uba85\ubc31\ud788 \uc720\ub9ac\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788, \uc774\ub294 \uc120\ud615 \ub9ac\ub4dc\uc544\uc6c3\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ubcc0\ud558\ub294 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc758 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \ucd94\uc801\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\uace0, \uace0\uc815 \ubd84\uc0b0 \uc608\uc0b0 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ub300 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ud45c\ud604 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc758 \uade0\ud615 \uc7a1\ud78c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \uc7a5\ub824\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ub354 \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc774 \ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc911\uc5d0 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ub4f1\ubc29\uc131 \uac00\uc6b0\uc2dc\uc548 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub85c \ud615\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc2a4\ucf00\uce58\ub41c \ub4f1\ubc29\uc131 \uac00\uc6b0\uc2dc\uc548 \uc815\uaddc\ud654\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \uac83\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774 \uac04\ub2e8\ud558\uace0 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc800\ub834\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc131 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0, \ud45c\ud604 \ubd95\uad34, \ub274\ub7f0 \ud734\uba74 \ubc0f \ud6c8\ub828 \ubd88\uc548\uc815\uc744 \uc904\uc778\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

We introduce InfEngine, an autonomous intelligent computational engine designed to drive a paradigm shift from human-led orchestration to collaborative automation. It integrates four specialized agents through two core innovations: self-verification, enabled by joint solver-evaluator debugging, improves functional correctness and scientific plausibility; self-optimization, realized via evolutionary algorithms with self-discovered fitness functions, facilitates autonomous performance optimization. Evaluated on InfBench with 200 infrared-specific tasks and powered by InfTools with 270 curated tools, InfEngine achieves a 92.7% pass rate and delivers workflows 21x faster than manual expert effort.

While data assimilation can mitigate these issues, classical variational smoothers require computationally expensive tangent-linear and adjoint models. Conversely, recent efficient latent filtering methods often enforce weak trajectory-level constraints and assume fixed observation grids. To bridge this gap, we propose Latent Ensemble Variational Data Assimilation (LEVDA), an ensemble-space variational smoother that operates in the low-dimensional latent space of a pretrained differentiable neural dynamics surrogate. By performing four-dimensional ensemble-variational (4DEnVar) optimization within an ensemble subspace, LEVDA jointly assimilates states and unknown parameters without the need for adjoint code or auxiliary observation-to-latent encoders. Leveraging the fully differentiable, continuous-in-time-and-space nature of the surrogate, LEVDA naturally accommodates highly irregular sampling at arbitrary spatiotemporal locations. Across three challenging geophysical benchmarks, LEVDA matches or outperforms state-of-the-art latent filtering baselines under severe observational sparsity while providing more reliable uncertainty quantification.

We propose a parsimonious Bayesian risk decomposition expressing expected loss as the product of three terms: the probability of system failure, the conditional probability that a failure propagates into harm given the automation level, and the expected severity of harm. This framework isolates a critical quantity -- the conditional probability that failures propagate into harm -- which captures execution and oversight risk rather than model accuracy alone. We develop complete theoretical foundations: formal proofs of the decomposition, a harm propagation equivalence theorem linking the harm propagation probability to observable execution controls, risk elasticity measures, efficient frontier analysis for automation policy, and optimal resource allocation principles with second-order conditions. We motivate the framework with an illustrative case study of the 2012 Knight Capital incident ($440M loss) as one instantiation of a broadly applicable failure pattern, and characterize the research design required to empirically validate the framework at scale across deployment domains.

Liquidity Providers (LPs) face a non-trivial trade-off between maximizing fee accrual through tight price-range concentration and minimizing the friction costs of rebalancing, including gas fees and swap slippage. Existing methods typically employ heuristic or threshold strategies that fail to account for market dynamics. This paper formulates liquidity management as an optimal control problem and derives the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman quasi-variational inequality (HJB-QVI). We present an approximate solution RAmmStein, a Deep Reinforcement Learning method that incorporates the mean-reversion speed (theta) of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process among other features as input to the model. We demonstrate that the agent learns to separate the state space into regions of action and inaction. We evaluate the framework using high-frequency 1Hz Coinbase trade data comprising over 6.8M trades. Experimental results show that RAmmStein achieves a superior net ROI of 0.72% compared to both passive and aggressive strategies. Notably, the agent reduces rebalancing frequency by 67% compared to a greedy rebalancing strategy while maintaining 88% active time. Our results demonstrate that regime-aware laziness can significantly improve capital efficiency by preserving the returns that would otherwise be eroded by the operational costs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ud0c8\uc911\uc559\ud654 \uac70\ub798\uc18c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc9d1\uc911 \uc720\ub3d9\uc131 \uc81c\uacf5\uc740 \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ucda9\ub3d9 \uc870\uc808 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b8\ub2e4. \uc720\ub3d9\uc131 \uc81c\uacf5\uc790(LP)\ub294 \uac00\uaca9 \ubc94\uc704 \uc9d1\uc911\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \uc218\uc218\ub8cc \uc218\uc775 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\uc640 \uc7ac\uc870\uc815\uc758 \ub9c8\ucc30 \ube44\uc6a9 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654 \uac04\uc758 \ube44\ud2b8\ub9ac\ube44\uc5bc\ud55c \uac70\ub798\ub97c \uc9c1\uba74\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud0c8\uc911\uc559\ud654 \uac70\ub798\uc18c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc720\ub3d9\uc131 \uad00\ub9ac \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud568.", "method": "\uc720\ub3d9\uc131 \uad00\ub9ac\ub97c \ucd5c\uc801 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uace0 HJB-QVI\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uba70, RAmmStein\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ub525 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc.", "result": "RAmmStein\uc740 0.72%\uc758 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc21c ROI\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0, \uc7ac\uc870\uc815 \ube48\ub3c4\ub97c 67% \uc904\uc774\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 88%\uc758 \ud65c\ub3d9 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\ub3c4 \uc778\uc2dd\uc758 \uac8c\uc73c\ub984\uc774 \uc6b4\uc601 \ube44\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc190\uc2e4\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc218\uc775\uc744 \ubcf4\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \uc790\ubcf8 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud0c8\uc911\uc559\ud654 \uac70\ub798\uc18c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9d1\uc911 \uc720\ub3d9\uc131 \uc81c\uacf5\uc740 \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ucda9\ub3d9 \ud1b5\uc81c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc720\ub3d9\uc131 \uacf5\uae09\uc790(LP)\ub294 \uac00\uaca9 \ubc94\uc704 \uc9d1\uc911\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc218\uc218\ub8cc \uc218\uc775\uc744 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud558\ub824\ub294 \uac83\uacfc \uac00\uc2a4 \uc694\uae08 \ubc0f \uc2a4\uc651 \uc2acippage\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uc7ac\uc870\uc815\uc758 \ub9c8\ucc30 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\ub824\ub294 \uac83 \uc0ac\uc774\uc758 \ube44\ud2b8\ub9ac\ube44\uc5bc\ud55c \uac70\ub798\ub97c \uc9c1\uba74\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2dc\uc7a5 \uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1 \ub610\ub294 \uc784\uacc4\uac12 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc720\ub3d9\uc131 \uad00\ub9ac\ub97c \ucd5c\uc801 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uadf8\uc5d0 \ud574\ub2f9\ud558\ub294 \ud574\ubc00\ud134-\uc790\ucf54\ube44-\ubca8\ub9cc \uc900\ubcc0\uc218 \ubd88\ud3c9\ub4f1(HJB-QVI)\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc624\ub974\uc2a4\ud0c0\uc778-\uc6b8\ub80c\ubc31 \uacfc\uc815\uc758 \ud3c9\uade0 \ud68c\uadc0 \uc18d\ub3c4(\uc138\ud0c0)\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uc5ec\ub7ec \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc785\ub825\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub525 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc778 RAmmStein \uadfc\uc0ac \ud574\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc0c1\ud0dc \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \ud589\ub3d9\uacfc \ube44\ud589\uc758 \uc601\uc5ed\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ubc30\uc6b4\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 680\ub9cc \uac74 \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uac70\ub798\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ub192\uc740 \uc8fc\ud30c\uc218\uc758 1Hz Coinbase \uac70\ub798 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc RAmmStein\uc774 \uc218\ub3d9 \ubc0f \uacf5\uaca9\uc801\uc778 \uc804\ub7b5\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 0.72%\uc758 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc21c ROI\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ud0d0\uc695\uc801\uc778 \uc7ac\uc870\uc815 \uc804\ub7b5\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc7ac\uc870\uc815 \ube48\ub3c4\ub97c 67% \uc904\uc774\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 88%\uc758 \ud65c\ub3d9 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc81c\ub3c4 \uc778\uc2dd\uc758 \uac8c\uc73c\ub984\uc774 \uc6b4\uc601 \ube44\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc190\uc2e4\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc218\uc775\uc744 \ubcf4\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \uc790\ubcf8 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

While existing benchmarks focus on domain-aware environments for developing specialized agents, evaluating general-purpose agents requires more realistic settings that challenge them to operate across multiple skills and tools within a unified environment. We introduce General AgentBench, a benchmark that provides such a unified framework for evaluating general LLM agents across search, coding, reasoning, and tool-use domains. Using General AgentBench, we systematically study test-time scaling behaviors under sequential scaling (iterative interaction) and parallel scaling (sampling multiple trajectories). Evaluation of ten leading LLM agents reveals a substantial performance degradation when moving from domain-specific evaluations to this general-agent setting. Moreover, we find that neither scaling methodology yields effective performance improvements in practice, due to two fundamental limitations: context ceiling in sequential scaling and verification gap in parallel scaling.

Recent methods improve attack effectiveness by leveraging future rewards to guide adversarial perturbation generation over sequential time steps (i.e., reward-based attacks). However, these methods are unable to capture dependencies between different time steps in the perturbation generation process, resulting in a weak temporal correlation between the current perturbation and previous perturbations.In this paper, we propose a novel method called Advantage-based Adversarial Transformer (AAT), which can generate adversarial examples with stronger temporal correlations (i.e., time-correlated adversarial examples) to improve the attack performance. AAT employs a multi-scale causal self-attention (MSCSA) mechanism to dynamically capture dependencies between historical information from different time periods and the current state, thus enhancing the correlation between the current perturbation and the previous perturbation. Moreover, AAT introduces a weighted advantage mechanism, which quantifies the effectiveness of a perturbation in a given state and guides the generation process toward high-performance adversarial examples by sampling high-advantage regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the performance of AAT matches or surpasses mainstream adversarial attack baselines on Atari, DeepMind Control Suite and Google football tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 AAT\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uacf5\uaca9 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0c1\uad00\ub41c \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc608\uc81c\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "DRL \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc785\ub825\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc785\uc99d\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "AAT\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911scale \uc778\uacfc \uc790\uae30 \uc8fc\uc758 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uacfc\uac70 \uc815\ubcf4\uc640 \ud604\uc7ac \uc0c1\ud0dc \uac04\uc758 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "AAT\ub294 \uc544\ud0c0\ub9ac, \ub525\ub9c8\uc778\ub4dc \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc2a4\uc704\ud2b8 \ubc0f \uad6c\uae00 \ud48b\ubcfc \uacfc\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc8fc\ub958 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "AAT\ub294 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0c1\uad00\ub41c \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc608\uc81c\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc2ec\uce35 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(DRL) \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc801\ub300\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \uc785\ub825(\uc989, \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc608\uc81c)\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ucd5c\uc801\uc774\uac70\ub098 \uc548\uc804\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc720\ub3c4\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \ud5a5\ud6c4 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc21c\ucc28\uc801 \uc2dc\uac04 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ubcc0\ub3d9 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uc548\ub0b4\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uacf5\uaca9 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4(\uc989, \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uae30\ubc18 \uacf5\uaca9). \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \ubcc0\ub3d9 \uc0dd\uc131 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \uc2dc\uac04 \ub2e8\uacc4 \uac04\uc758 \uc758\uc874\uc131\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uc5ec \ud604\uc7ac \ubcc0\ub3d9\uacfc \uc774\uc804 \ubcc0\ub3d9 \uac04\uc758 \uc57d\ud55c \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub354 \uac15\ud55c \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc608\uc81c\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 Advantage-based Adversarial Transformer(AAT)\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, achieving generalized planning remains elusive, not only by the scarcity of high-quality interaction data but also by inherent conflicts across heterogeneous planning tasks. These challenges result in models that excel at isolated tasks yet struggle to generalize, while existing multi-task training attempts suffer from gradient interference. In this paper, we present \\textbf{MagicAgent}, a series of foundation models specifically designed for generalized agent planning. We introduce a lightweight and scalable synthetic data framework that generates high-quality trajectories across diverse planning tasks, including hierarchical task decomposition, tool-augmented planning, multi-constraint scheduling, procedural logic orchestration, and long-horizon tool execution. To mitigate training conflicts, we propose a two-stage training paradigm comprising supervised fine-tuning followed by multi-objective reinforcement learning over both static datasets and dynamic environments. Empirical results demonstrate that MagicAgent-32B and MagicAgent-30B-A3B deliver superior performance, achieving accuracies of $75.1\\%$ on Worfbench, $55.9\\%$ on NaturalPlan, $57.5\\%$ on $\u03c4^2$-Bench, $86.9\\%$ on BFCL-v3, and $81.2\\%$ on ACEBench, as well as strong results on our in-house MagicEval benchmarks.

These tasks were taken from vLLM and SGLang, two of the most popular LLM serving frameworks. Each task provides an agent with a codebase and bottleneck description, whereby the agent must produce an optimization patch evaluated against expert human solutions. We curated 54 tasks from merged pull requests with measurable performance improvements. While existing benchmarks heavily use runtime-based metrics, such approaches can be gamed to pass tests without capturing the actual intent of the code changes. Therefore, we combine both hard (execution-based) and soft (LLM-based) metrics to show that both are necessary for complete evaluation. While evaluating both closed and open-source coding agents, we find no single agent dominates across codebases. Surprisingly, agents often identify correct bottlenecks but fail to execute working solutions. We also show that agents with identical underlying models differ substantially, suggesting scaffolding is as important as the model.", "AI": {"tldr": "ISO-Bench\ub294 \ucf54\ub529 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \ucd94\ub860 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ud558\ub294 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub85c, 54\uac1c\uc758 \uc791\uc5c5\uc774 \ud3ec\ud568\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ud558\ub4dc\uc640 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ucf54\ub529 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \ud544\uc694", "method": "\ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \uc778\uae30 \uc788\ub294 LLM \uc81c\uacf5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 vLLM\uacfc SGLang\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\uace0, \ud558\ub4dc \ubc0f \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ud328\uce58\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00", "result": "54\uac1c\uc758 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc774 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ubcd1\ubaa9\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc2e4\ud328\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc788\uc74c", "conclusion": "\ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uae30\ucd08\uac00 \ub3d9\uc77c\ud558\ub354\ub77c\ub3c4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04 \ucc28\uc774\uac00 \ud06c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc2a4\uce90\ud3f4\ub529\uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9cc\ud07c \uc911\uc694\ud568\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 ISO-Bench\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ucf54\ub529 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc138\uacc4\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc791\uc5c5\uc740 \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \uc778\uae30 \uc788\ub294 LLM \uc81c\uacf5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 vLLM\uacfc SGLang\uc5d0\uc11c \uac00\uc838\uc654\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac01 \uc791\uc5c5\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0\uac8c \ucf54\ub4dc\ubca0\uc774\uc2a4\uc640 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc758 \uc778\uac04 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec \ud3c9\uac00\ub418\ub294 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ud328\uce58\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud574\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uce21\uc815 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5 \uac1c\uc120\uacfc \ud568\uaed8 \ubcd1\ud569\ub41c \ud480 \uc694\uccad\uc5d0\uc11c 54\uac1c\uc758 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc120\ubcc4\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub294 \ub7f0\ud0c0\uc784 \uae30\ubc18 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc744 \uacfc\ub3c4\ud558\uac8c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ubc18\uba74, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ucf54\ub4dc \ubcc0\uacbd\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc758\ub3c4\ub97c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\uacfc\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc870\uc791\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc644\uc804\ud558\uac8c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc2e4\ud589 \uae30\ubc18 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uacfc LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud3d0\uc1c4\ud615 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \uc624\ud508 \uc18c\uc2a4 \ucf54\ub529 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ub3d9\uc548 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5b4\ub5a4 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub3c4 \ucf54\ub4dc\ubca0\uc774\uc2a4 \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc9c0\ubc30\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub180\ub78d\uac8c\ub3c4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc885\uc885 \uc62c\ubc14\ub978 \ubcd1\ubaa9\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\ub294 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc2e4\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc2e4\ud328\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub610\ud55c \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \ub2e4\ub974\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc2a4\uce90\ud3f4\ub529\uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9cc\ud07c \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

To ensure industrial-grade reliability, this study proposes Agentic Problem Frames (APF), a systematic engineering framework that shifts focus from internal model intelligence to the structured interaction between the agent and its environment.\n  The APF establishes a dynamic specification paradigm where intent is concretized at runtime through domain knowledge injection. At its core, the Act-Verify-Refine (AVR) loop functions as a closed-loop control system that transforms execution results into verified knowledge assets, driving system behavior toward asymptotic convergence to mission requirements (R). To operationalize this, this study introduces the Agentic Job Description (AJD), a formal specification tool that defines jurisdictional boundaries, operational contexts, and epistemic evaluation criteria.\n  The efficacy of this framework is validated through two contrasting case studies: a delegated proxy model for business travel and an autonomous supervisor model for industrial equipment management. By applying AJD-based specification and APF modeling to these scenarios, the analysis demonstrates how operational scenarios are systematically controlled within defined boundaries. These cases provide a conceptual proof that agent reliability stems not from a model's internal reasoning alone, but from the rigorous engineering structures that anchor stochastic AI within deterministic business processes, thereby enabling the development of verifiable and dependable domain agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ub9ac\uc2a4\ud06c\ub97c \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\ub9c1 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Agentic Problem Frames (APF)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc774 \uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub85c \ubc1c\uc804\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \ubd88\uba85\ud655\ud55c \uc790\uc5f0\uc5b4\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294 \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \"\ud504\ub808\uc784 \uc5c6\ub294\" \uac1c\ubc1c \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \ubc94\uc704 \ud655\ub300 \ubc0f \uac1c\ubc29 \ub8e8\ud504 \uc2e4\ud328\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub9ac\uc2a4\ud06c\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub0b4\ubd80 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc815\ubcf4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \ud658\uacbd \uac04\uc758 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \uc804\ud658\ud558\ub294 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\ub9c1 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Agentic Problem Frames (APF)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

Rather than reasoning over primitive actions, we study agents that compose pre-trained policies as temporally extended actions, enabling solutions to complex tasks that no constituent alone can solve. Such compositional planning remains elusive as compounding errors in long-horizon predictions make it challenging to estimate the visitation distribution induced by sequencing policies. Motivated by the geometric policy composition framework introduced in arXiv:2206.08736, we address these challenges by learning predictive models of multi-step dynamics -- so-called jumpy world models -- that capture state occupancies induced by pre-trained policies across multiple timescales in an off-policy manner. Building on Temporal Difference Flows (arXiv:2503.09817), we enhance these models with a novel consistency objective that aligns predictions across timescales, improving long-horizon predictive accuracy.

In this work, we study a minimal continual learning agent designed to isolate representational dynamics from architectural complexity and optimization objectives. The agent maintains a persistent state vector across executions and incrementally updates it as new textual data is introduced. We quantify representational change using cosine similarity between successive normalized state vectors and define a stability metric over time intervals. Longitudinal experiments across eight executions reveal a transition from an initial plastic regime to a stable representational regime under consistent input. A deliberately introduced semantic perturbation produces a bounded decrease in similarity, followed by recovery and restabilization under subsequent coherent input. These results demonstrate that meaningful stability plasticity tradeoffs can emerge in a minimal, stateful learning system without explicit regularization, replay, or architectural complexity.

In real-world scenarios, a failure in a trivial task may reflect random instability, whereas success in a high-difficulty task signifies a genuine capability breakthrough. Yet, existing group-based policy optimization methods rigidly rely on statistical deviation within discrete batches, frequently misallocating credit when task difficulty fluctuates. To address this issue, we propose Proximity-based Multi-turn Optimization (ProxMO), a practical and robust framework engineered specifically for the constraints of real-world deployment. ProxMO integrates global context via two lightweight mechanisms: success-rate-aware modulation dynamically adapts gradient intensity based on episode-level difficulty, while proximity-based soft aggregation derives baselines through continuous semantic weighting at the step level. Extensive evaluations on ALFWorld and WebShop benchmarks demonstrate that ProxMO yields substantial performance gains over existing baselines with negligible computational cost. Ablation studies further validate the independent and synergistic efficacy of both mechanisms. Crucially, ProxMO offers plug-and-play compatibility with standard GRPO frameworks, facilitating immediate, low-friction adoption in existing industrial training pipelines.

Nevertheless, most existing RAG variants for textual graphs concentrate on low-dimensional structures -- treating nodes as entities (0-dimensional) and edges or paths as pairwise or sequential relations (1-dimensional), but overlook cycles, which are crucial for reasoning over relational loops. Such cycles often arise in questions requiring closed-loop inference about similar objects or relative positions. This limitation often results in incomplete contextual grounding and restricted reasoning capability. In this work, we propose Topology-enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (TopoRAG), a novel framework for textual graph question answering that effectively captures higher-dimensional topological and relational dependencies. Specifically, TopoRAG first lifts textual graphs into cellular complexes to model multi-dimensional topological structures. Leveraging these lifted representations, a topology-aware subcomplex retrieval mechanism is proposed to extract cellular complexes relevant to the input query, providing compact and informative topological context. Finally, a multi-dimensional topological reasoning mechanism operates over these complexes to propagate relational information and guide LLMs in performing structured, logic-aware inference. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method consistently surpasses existing baselines across diverse textual graph tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "TopoRAG\ub294 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uadf8\ub798\ud504

This paper explores an unsupervised approach to anomaly detection in network traffic using $\u03b2$-Variational Autoencoders on the NSL-KDD dataset. We investigate two methods: leveraging the latent space structure by measuring distances from test samples to the training data projections, and using the reconstruction error as a conventional anomaly detection metric. By comparing these approaches, we provide insights into their respective advantages and limitations in an unsupervised setting. Experimental results highlight the effectiveness of latent space exploitation for classification tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 NSL-KDD \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ud2b8\ub798\ud53d\uc758 \ube44\uc9c0\ub3c4 \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc6b4\uc601 \uae30\uc220\uc774 \uc815\ubcf4 \uae30\uc220\uacfc \uc810\uc810 \ud1b5\ud569\ub428\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uce68\uc785 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud574\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\ube44\uc9c0\ub3c4 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c, \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc0d8\ud50c\uacfc \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud22c\uc601 \uac04\uc758 \uac70\ub9ac \uce21\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc7a0\uc7ac \uacf5\uac04 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uace0, \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc9c0\ud45c\ub85c\uc11c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \ube44\uad50\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uac01\uac01\uc758 \uc7a5\uc810\uacfc \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ubd84\ub958 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc7a0\uc7ac \uacf5\uac04 \ud65c\uc6a9\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b4\uc601 \uae30\uc220\uc774 \uc815\ubcf4 \uae30\uc220\uacfc \uc810\uc810 \ud1b5\ud569\ub428\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uce68\uc785 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud574\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 NSL-KDD \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec $\u03b2$-\ubcc0\uc774\uc624\ud1a0\uc778\ucf54\ub354\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ud2b8\ub798\ud53d\uc758 \ube44\uc9c0\ub3c4 \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc0d8\ud50c\uacfc \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud22c\uc601 \uac04\uc758 \uac70\ub9ac \uce21\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc7a0\uc7ac \uacf5\uac04 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc9c0\ud45c\ub85c\uc11c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \ube44\uad50\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ube44\uc9c0\ub3c4 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uac01 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \uc7a5\uc810\uacfc \ud55c\uacc4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ubd84\ub958 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc7a0\uc7ac \uacf5\uac04 \ud65c\uc6a9\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

Recent reinforcement learning (RL) approaches learn such policies and achieve promising zero-shot generalization from small training instances to larger unseen ones. However, a fundamental limitation is anisotropic generalization, where an RL policy exhibits strong performance only in a specific region of the domain-parameter space while remaining fragile elsewhere due to training stochasticity and trajectory-dependent bias. To address this, we propose a Soft Mixture-of-Experts framework that combines multiple RL experts via a prior-confidence gating mechanism and treats these anisotropic behaviors as complementary specializations. The evaluation on the Air Traffic benchmark shows that Soft-MoE substantially expands the solvable parameter space and improves robustness compared to any single expert.", "AI": {"tldr":

However, training under this paradigm presents its own challenge: the extrapolation error stemming from out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Existing methodologies have endeavored to address this issue through means like penalizing OOD Q-values or imposing similarity constraints on the learned policy and the behavior policy. Nonetheless, these approaches are often beset by limitations such as being overly conservative in utilizing OOD data, imprecise OOD data characterization, and significant computational overhead. To address these challenges, this paper introduces an Uncertainty-Aware Rank-One Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) Q Network framework. The framework aims to enhance Offline Reinforcement Learning by fully leveraging the potential of OOD data while still ensuring efficiency in the learning process. Specifically, the framework quantifies data uncertainty and harnesses it in the training losses, aiming to train a policy that maximizes the lower confidence bound of the corresponding Q-function. Furthermore, a Rank-One MIMO architecture is introduced to model the uncertainty-aware Q-function, \\TP{offering the same ability for uncertainty quantification as an ensemble of networks but with a cost nearly equivalent to that of a single network}. Consequently, this framework strikes a harmonious balance between precision, speed, and memory efficiency, culminating in improved overall performance. Extensive experimentation on the D4RL benchmark demonstrates that the framework attains state-of-the-art performance while remaining computationally efficient. By incorporating the concept of uncertainty quantification, our framework offers a promising avenue to alleviate extrapolation errors and enhance the efficiency of offline RL.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c OOD \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uc678\uc0bd \uc624\ub958\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc778\uc2dd Rank-One \ub2e4\uc911 \uc785\ub825 \ub2e4\uc911 \ucd9c\ub825 MIMO Q \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc548\uc804\ud558\uace0 \uc27d\uac8c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0, OOD \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uc678\uc0bd \uc624\ub958\ub77c\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828 \uc190\uc2e4\uc5d0 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 Rank-One MIMO \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "D4RL \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc678\uc0bd \uc624\ub958\ub97c \uc644\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 RL\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc740 \uc548\uc804\ud558\uace0 \uc27d\uac8c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uad00\uc2ec\uc744 \ubc1b\uc558\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784 \ud558\uc5d0 \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 OOD(\ubd84\ud3ec \uc678) \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uc678\uc0bd \uc624\ub958\ub77c\ub294 \ub3c4\uc804\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 OOD Q \uac12\uc5d0 \ud398\ub110\ud2f0\ub97c \ubd80\uc5ec\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \uc815\ucc45\uacfc \ud589\ub3d9 \uc815\ucc45 \uac04 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ubd80\uacfc\ud558\ub294 \ub4f1\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud588\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\ub4e4\uc740 \uc885\uc885 OOD \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc9c0\ub098\uce58\uac8c \ubcf4\uc218\uc801\uc774\uac70\ub098, OOD \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud2b9\uc131\ud654\uac00 \ubd80\uc815\ud655\ud558\uace0, \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \ub4f1\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc778\uc2dd Rank-One \ub2e4\uc911 \uc785\ub825 \ub2e4\uc911 \ucd9c\ub825(MIMO) Q \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 OOD \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \ucd5c\ub300\ud55c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uacfc\uc815\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uc5ec \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828 \uc190\uc2e4\uc5d0 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud574\ub2f9 Q \ud568\uc218\uc758 \ub0ae\uc740 \uc2e0\ub8b0 \uad6c\uac04\uc744 \ucd5c\ub300\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub354 \ub098\uc544\uac00, \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc778\uc2dd Q \ud568\uc218\ub97c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 Rank-One MIMO \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uac00 \ub3c4\uc785\ub418\uc5b4, \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \uc559\uc0c1\ube14\uacfc \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \ub2e8\uc77c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc640 \ube44\uc2b7\ud55c \ube44\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b4\uc601\ub41c\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc815\ud655\uc131, \uc18d\ub3c4 \ubc0f \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \uc870\ud654\ub97c \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4 \uc885\ud569\uc801\uc778 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ub0b3\ub294\ub2e4.

To address these constraints, we present the Alzheimer's Learning Platform for Adaptive Care Agents (ALPACA), an open-source, Gym-compatible reinforcement learning (RL) environment for systematically exploring personalized treatment strategies using existing therapies. ALPACA is powered by the Continuous Action-conditioned State Transitions (CAST) model trained on longitudinal trajectories from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), enabling medication-conditioned simulation of disease progression under alternative treatment decisions.

In this work, we extend the role of diffusion models beyond merely generating synthetic data, examining whether their internal representations, which encode meaningful features of the data, can provide additional benefits for robust classifier training. Through systematic experiments, we show that diffusion models offer representations that are both diverse and partially robust, and that explicitly incorporating diffusion representations as an auxiliary learning signal during AT consistently improves robustness across settings. Furthermore, our representation analysis indicates that incorporating diffusion models into AT encourages more disentangled features, while diffusion representations and diffusion-generated synthetic data play complementary roles in shaping representations.

Supply chain optimization models frequently become infeasible because of modeling errors. Diagnosis and repair require scarce OR expertise: analysts must interpret solver diagnostics, trace root causes across echelons, and fix formulations without sacrificing operational soundness. Whether AI agents can perform this task remains untested.\n  Methodology/Results. OptiRepair splits this task into a domain-agnostic feasibility phase (iterative IIS-guided repair of any LP) and a domain-specific validation phase (five rationality checks grounded in inventory theory). We test 22 API models from 7 families on 976 multi-echelon supply chain problems and train two 8B-parameter models using self-taught reasoning with solver-verified rewards. The trained models reach 81.7% Rational Recovery Rate (RRR) -- the fraction of problems resolved to both feasibility and operational rationality -- versus 42.2% for the best API model and 21.3% on average. The gap concentrates in Phase 1 repair: API models average 27.6% recovery rate versus 97.2% for trained models.\n  Managerial Implications. Two gaps separate current AI from reliable model repair: solver interaction (API models restore only 27.6% of infeasible formulations) and operational rationale (roughly one in four feasible repairs violate supply chain theory). Each requires a different intervention: solver interaction responds to targeted training; operational rationale requires explicit specification as solver-verifiable checks.

However, DFL faces three critical challenges: privacy leakage from honest-but-curious neighbors, slow convergence due to the lack of central coordination, and vulnerability to Byzantine adversaries aiming to degrade model accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a novel DFL framework that integrates Byzantine robustness, privacy preservation, and convergence acceleration. Within this framework, each device trains a local model using a Bayesian approach and independently selects an optimal subset of neighbors for posterior exchange. We formulate this neighbor selection as an optimization problem to minimize the global loss function under security and privacy constraints. Solving this problem is challenging because devices only possess partial network information, and the complex coupling between topology, security, and convergence remains unclear. To bridge this gap, we first analytically characterize the trade-offs between dynamic connectivity, Byzantine detection, privacy levels, and convergence speed. Leveraging these insights, we develop a fully distributed Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm. This approach enables devices to make autonomous connection decisions based on local observations. Simulation results demonstrate that our method achieves superior robustness and efficiency with significantly lower overhead compared to traditional security and privacy schemes.", "AI": {"tldr":

Existing methods are either unsupervised or semi-supervised: unsupervised methods avoid the need for labeled anomalies but often produce ambiguous boundary, whereas semi-supervised methods can overfit to the limited labeled anomalies and generalize poorly to unseen anomalies. To address this gap, we consider a largely underexplored problem in DGAD: learning a discriminative boundary from normal/unlabeled data, while leveraging limited labeled anomalies \\textbf{when available} without sacrificing generalization to unseen anomalies. To this end, we propose an effective, generalizable, and model-agnostic framework with three main components: (i) residual representation encoding that capture deviations between current interactions and their historical context, providing anomaly-relevant signals; (ii) a restriction loss that constrain the normal representations within an interval bounded by two co-centered hyperspheres, ensuring consistent scales while keeping anomalies separable; (iii) a bi-boundary optimization strategy that learns a discriminative and robust boundary using the normal log-likelihood distribution modeled by a normalizing flow.

We investigate how human guidance of agentic AI can improve multimodal clinical prediction, presenting our approach to all three AgentDS Healthcare benchmark challenges: 30-day hospital readmission prediction (Macro-F1 = 0.8986), emergency department cost forecasting (MAE = $465.13), and discharge readiness assessment (Macro-F1 = 0.7939). Across these tasks, human analysts directed the agentic workflow at key decision points, multimodal feature engineering from clinical notes, scanned PDF billing receipts, and time-series vital signs; task-appropriate model selection; and clinically informed validation strategies. Our approach ranked 5th overall in the healthcare domain, with a 3rd-place finish on the discharge readiness task. Ablation studies reveal that human-guided decisions compounded to a cumulative gain of +0.065 F1 over automated baselines, with multimodal feature extraction contributing the largest single improvement (+0.041 F1). We distill three generalizable lessons: (1) domain-informed feature engineering at each pipeline stage yields compounding gains that outperform extensive automated search; (2) multimodal data integration requires task-specific human judgment that no single extraction strategy generalizes across clinical text, PDFs, and time-series; and (3) deliberate ensemble diversity with clinically motivated model configurations outperforms random hyperparameter search. These findings offer practical guidance for teams deploying agentic AI in healthcare settings where interpretability, reproducibility, and clinical validity are essential.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc9c0\ub3c4\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI\uac00 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \uc784\uc0c1 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\ub294 \uc5f0\uad6c.", "motivation": "\uc784\uc0c1 \uc608\uce21 \uc791\uc5c5\uc740 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc804\ubb38 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\uba70 \uc21c\uc218 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \uc774\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc778\uac04 \ubd84\uc11d\uac00\uac00 \uc8fc\uc694 \uacb0\uc815 \uc9c0\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub97c \uc548\ub0b4\ud558\uace0, \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ud2b9\uc131 \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\ub9c1, \ubaa8\ub378 \uc120\ud0dd \ubc0f \uc784\uc0c1\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\ubcf4\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uac80\uc99d \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud588\ub2e4.", "result": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 30\uc77c \ubcd1\uc6d0 \uc7ac\uc785\uc6d0 \uc608\uce21(Macro-F1 = 0.8986), \uc751\uae09\uc2e4 \ube44\uc6a9 \uc608\uce21(MAE = $465.13), \ud1f4\uc6d0 \uc900\ube44 \uc0c1\ud0dc \ud3c9\uac00(Macro-F1 = 0.7939)\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \uac70\ub480\uc73c\uba70, \uc804\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud5ec\uc2a4\ucf00\uc5b4 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c 5\uc704\uc5d0 \uc62c\ub790\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI\ub97c \uc784\uc0c1 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \ubc30\uce58\ud558\ub294 \ud300\ub4e4\uc5d0\uac8c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uc9c0\uce68\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uacfc\ud559 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\ub098, \uc784\uc0c1 \uc608\uce21 \uc791\uc5c5\uc740 \uc21c\uc218 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uae30 \ud798\ub4e0 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc804\ubb38 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc9c0\ub3c4\uac00 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \uc784\uc0c1 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uace0, 30\uc77c \ubcd1\uc6d0 \uc7ac\uc785\uc6d0 \uc608\uce21(Macro-F1 = 0.8986), \uc751\uae09\uc2e4 \ube44\uc6a9 \uc608\uce21(MAE = $465.13), \ud1f4\uc6d0 \uc900\ube44 \uc0c1\ud0dc \ud3c9\uac00(Macro-F1 = 0.7939)\ub77c\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 AgentDS \uc758\ub8cc \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \uacfc\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5 \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc778\uac04 \ubd84\uc11d\uac00\ub4e4\uc740 \uc8fc\uc694 \uacb0\uc815 \uc9c0\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uc6cc\ud06c\ud50c\ub85c\uc6b0\ub97c \uc548\ub0b4\ud558\uace0, \uc784\uc0c1 \ub178\ud2b8, \uc2a4\uce94\ud55c PDF \uccad\uad6c \uc601\uc218\uc99d \ubc0f \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc0dd\uccb4 \uc2e0\ud638\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc\uc758 \ud2b9\uc131 \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\ub9c1\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc801\uc808\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378 \uc120\ud0dd \ubc0f \uc784\uc0c1\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\ubcf4\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uac80\uc99d \uc804\ub7b5\ub3c4 \ud3ec\ud568\ub41c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud5ec\uc2a4\ucf00\uc5b4 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uc885\ud569\uc801\uc73c\ub85c 5\uc704, \ud1f4\uc6d0 \uc900\ube44 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c 3\uc704\ub97c \uae30\ub85d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc81c\uac70 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc778\uac04\uc774 \uc548\ub0b4\ud558\ub294 \uacb0\uc815\uc774 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654 \uae30\uc900\ubcf4\ub2e4 +0.065 F1\uc758 \ub204\uc801 \uc774\ub4dd\uc744 \uac00\uc838\uc654\uc73c\uba70, \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ud2b9\uc131 \ucd94\ucd9c\uc774 \uac00\uc7a5 \ud070 \ub2e8\uc77c \uac1c\uc120(+0.041 F1)\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uad50\ud6c8\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4: (1) \uac01 \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0 \uc815\ubcf4\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \ud2b9\uc131 \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\ub9c1\uc774 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654 \uac80\uc0c9\uc744 \ub2a5\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ub204\uc801 \uc774\ub4dd\uc744 \uac00\uc838\uc628\ub2e4;

However, they remain vulnerable in environments where a single error often leads to irrecoverable failure, particularly under strict feasibility constraints. We systematically analyze existing agent frameworks, identifying imperfect planning and stochastic execution as the primary causes. To address these challenges, we propose Tool-guided Adaptive Planning with constrained Execution (TAPE). TAPE enhances planning capability by aggregating multiple plans into a graph and employing an external solver to identify a feasible path. During execution, TAPE employs constrained decoding to reduce sampling noise, while adaptively re-planning whenever environmental feedback deviates from the intended state. Experiments across Sokoban, ALFWorld, MuSiQue, and GSM8K-Hard demonstrate that TAPE consistently outperforms existing frameworks, with particularly large gains on hard settings, improving success rates by 21.0 percentage points on hard settings on average, and by 20.0 percentage points for weaker base models on average.

Existing routing approaches face two limitations: (1) input-level routers make coarse query-level decisions that ignore evolving task requirements; (2) RL-trained orchestrators are expensive to adapt and often suffer from routing collapse, repeatedly invoking one strong but costly option in multi-turn scenarios. We introduce SkillOrchestra, a framework for skill-aware orchestration. Instead of directly learning a routing policy end-to-end, SkillOrchestra learns fine-grained skills from execution experience and models agent-specific competence and cost under those skills. At deployment, the orchestrator infers the skill demands of the current interaction and selects agents that best satisfy them under an explicit performance-cost trade-off. Extensive experiments across ten benchmarks demonstrate that SkillOrchestra outperforms SoTA RL-based orchestrators by up to 22.5% with 700x and 300x learning cost reduction compared to Router-R1 and ToolOrchestra, respectively. These results show that explicit skill modeling enables scalable, interpretable, and sample-efficient orchestration, offering a principled alternative to data-intensive RL-based approaches.

The literature documents emergent collective phenomena, security vulnerabilities spanning 131 agent skills and over 15,200 exposed control panels, and five recurring architectural patterns. ClawdLab addresses these failure modes through hard role restrictions, structured adversarial critique, PI-led governance, multi-model orchestration, and domain-specific evidence requirements encoded as protocol constraints that ground validation in computational tool outputs rather than social consensus; the architecture provides emergent Sybil resistance as a structural consequence. A three-tier taxonomy distinguishes single-agent pipelines, predetermined multi-agent workflows, and fully decentralised systems, analysing why leading AI co-scientist platforms remain confined to the first two tiers. ClawdLab's composable third-tier architecture, in which foundation models, capabilities, governance, and evidence requirements are independently modifiable, enables compounding improvement as the broader AI ecosystem advances.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 OpenClaw\uc640 Moltbook\uc774 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c \uc790\uc728 AI \uac04 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc758 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \ubb38\ud5cc \uac80\ud1a0\uc640 ClawdLab\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc624\ud508\uc18c\uc2a4 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "OpenClaw\uc640 Moltbook\uc774 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc790\uc728 AI \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub294 \ud559\ubb38\uc801 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uae30\ud68c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubb38\ud5cc \uac80\ud1a0\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 AI \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc758 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \uc2e4\ud328 \ubaa8\ub4dc\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub514\uc790\uc778 \uacfc\ud559 \uc751\ub2f5\uc73c\ub85c ClawdLab \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "ClawdLab\uc740 \ud558\ub4dc \uc5ed\ud560 \uc81c\ud55c, \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \ube44\ud310, PI \uc8fc\ub3c4 \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4 \ub4f1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc2e4\ud328 \ubaa8\ub4dc\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0, Emergent Sybil \uc800\ud56d \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "ClawdLab\uc758 \uc870\ud569 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub294 AI \uc0dd\ud0dc\uacc4\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "2026\ub144 1\uc6d4, \uc624\ud508\uc18c\uc2a4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c OpenClaw\uc640 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc804\uc6a9 \uc18c\uc15c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c Moltbook\uc740 \uc790\uc728 AI \uac04 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc758 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc0dd\uc0b0\ud558\uba70 14\uc77c \ub0b4\uc5d0 6\uac1c\uc758 \ud559\uc220 \ucd9c\ud310\ubb3c\uc744 \uc720\uce58\ud588\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud574\ub2f9 \uc0dd\ud0dc\uacc4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub2e4\uc131 \ubb38\ud5cc \uac80\ud1a0\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud558\uace0 \uc790\uc728 \uacfc\ud559 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc624\ud508 \uc18c\uc2a4 \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc778 ClawdLab\uc744 \uc124\uacc4 \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \uc751\ub2f5\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubb38\ud5cc\uc740 131\uac1c\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uae30\uc220\uacfc 15,200\uac1c \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \ub178\ucd9c\ub41c \uc81c\uc5b4\ud310\uc5d0 \uac78\uce5c \ubcf4\uc548 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810 \ubc0f \ub2e4\uc12f \uac00\uc9c0 \ubc18\ubcf5\ub418\ub294 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ubb38\uc11c\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.

This paper argues that this failure is not technical but foundational: imitation learning has been optimised for the wrong objective. We propose a research agenda that redefines success from perfect replay to compositional adaptability. Such adaptability hinges on learning behavioural primitives once and recombining them through novel contexts without retraining.

Over a two-week period, twenty AI researchers interacted with the agents under benign and adversarial conditions. Focusing on failures emerging from the integration of language models with autonomy, tool use, and multi-party communication, we document eleven representative case studies. Observed behaviors include unauthorized compliance with non-owners, disclosure of sensitive information, execution of destructive system-level actions, denial-of-service conditions, uncontrolled resource consumption, identity spoofing vulnerabilities, cross-agent propagation of unsafe practices, and partial system takeover. In several cases, agents reported task completion while the underlying system state contradicted those reports. We also report on some of the failed attempts. Our findings establish the existence of security-, privacy-, and governance-relevant vulnerabilities in realistic deployment settings. These behaviors raise unresolved questions regarding accountability, delegated authority, and responsibility for downstream harms, and warrant urgent attention from legal scholars, policymakers, and researchers across disciplines.

Research study with 258 trials on SWE-bench-lite tasks. Code and data: https://github.com/tpaip607/research-codecompass", "summary": "Modern code intelligence agents operate in contexts exceeding 1 million tokens--far beyond the scale where humans manually locate relevant files. Yet agents consistently fail to discover architecturally critical files when solving real-world coding tasks. We identify the Navigation Paradox: agents perform poorly not due to context limits, but because navigation and retrieval are fundamentally distinct problems. Through 258 automated trials across 30 benchmark tasks on a production FastAPI repository, we demonstrate that graph-based structural navigation via CodeCompass--a Model Context Protocol server exposing dependency graphs--achieves 99.4% task completion on hidden-dependency tasks, a 23.2 percentage-point improvement over vanilla agents (76.2%) and 21.2 points over BM25 retrieval (78.2%).However, we uncover a critical adoption gap: 58% of trials with graph access made zero tool calls, and agents required explicit prompt engineering to adopt the tool consistently. Our findings reveal that the bottleneck is not tool availability but behavioral alignment--agents must be explicitly guided to leverage structural context over lexical heuristics. We contribute: (1) a task taxonomy distinguishing semantic-search, structural, and hidden-dependency scenarios; (2) empirical evidence that graph navigation outperforms retrieval when dependencies lack lexical overlap; and (3) open-source infrastructure for reproducible evaluation of navigation tools.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ud604\ub300 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc778\ud154\ub9ac\uc804\uc2a4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 100\ub9cc \uac1c \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \ud1a0\ud070\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc2e4\uc81c \ucf54\ub529 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694 \ud30c\uc77c\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2e4\ud328\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub0b4\ube44\uac8c\uc774\uc158 \ud328\ub7ec\ub3c5\uc2a4\ub97c \uaddc\uba85\ud558\uba70, \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uae30\ubc18 \uad6c\uc870 \ub0b4\ube44\uac8c\uc774\uc158\uc774 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801 \uac80\uc0c9\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud568\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ucf54\ub4dc \uc778\ud154\ub9ac\uc804\uc2a4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc2e4\uc81c \ucf54\ub529 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud560 \ub54c \ud544\uc218 \ud30c\uc77c\uc744 \ucc3e\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc5f0\uad6c\uc9c4\uc740 FastAPI \ub9ac\ud3ec\uc9c0\ud1a0\ub9ac\uc5d0\uc11c 30\uac1c\uc758 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 258\ud68c\uc758 \uc790\ub3d9 \uc2dc\ud5d8\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc600\uace0, CodeCompass\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uae30\ubc18 \uad6c\uc870 \ub0b4\ube44\uac8c\uc774\uc158\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "CodeCompass\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uae30\ubc18 \ub0b4\ube44\uac8c\uc774\uc158\uc740 \uc228\uaca8\uc9c4 \uc885\uc18d \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c 99.4%\uc758 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc644\ub8cc\uc728\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub3c4\uad6c \uc811\uadfc\uc131\uc744 \ub118\uc5b4\uc120 \ud589\ub3d9\uc801 \uc815\ub82c\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \ubc1c\uacac\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc548\ub0b4\ud574\uc57c \ud568\uc744 \ubc1d\ud614\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud604\ub300 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc778\ud154\ub9ac\uc804\uc2a4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 100\ub9cc \uac1c \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \ud1a0\ud070\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\ub294 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc778\uac04\uc774 \uc218\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uad00\ub828 \ud30c\uc77c\uc744 \ucc3e\ub294 \uac83\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud6e8\uc52c \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub098\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \ucf54\ub529 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud560 \ub54c \uac74\ucd95\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ud30c\uc77c\uc744 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub0b4\ube44\uac8c\uc774\uc158 \ud328\ub7ec\ub3c5\uc2a4\ub97c \ud655\uc778\ud588\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc131\uacfc\uac00 \uc88b\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uc774\uc720\uac00 \ub9e5\ub77d \ud55c\uacc4 \ub54c\ubb38\uc774 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \ub0b4\ube44\uac8c\uc774\uc158\uacfc \uac80\uc0c9\uc774 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \ubb38\uc81c\uc774\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc774\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 CodeCompass\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uae30\ubc18 \uad6c\uc870 \ub0b4\ube44\uac8c\uc774\uc158\uc774 \uc228\uaca8\uc9c4 \uc885\uc18d \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c 99.4%\uc758 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc644\ub8cc\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8(76.2%)\ubcf4\ub2e4 23.2 \ubc31\ubd84\uc728 \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8, BM25 \uac80\uc0c9(78.2%)\ubcf4\ub2e4 21.2 \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8 \uac1c\uc120\ub41c \uacb0\uacfc\uc784\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ucc44\ud0dd \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uc600\ub2e4: \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc811\uadfc\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc758 58%\uac00 \ub3c4\uad6c \ud638\ucd9c\uc744 \ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uc73c\uba70, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ucc44\ud0dd\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc124\uacc4\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud588\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc1c\uacac\uc740 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc774 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc758 \uac00\uc6a9\uc131\uc774 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \ud589\ub3d9\uc801 \uc815\ub82c\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc5b4\ud718\uc801 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc548\ub0b4\ub418\uc5b4\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 (1) \uc758\ubbf8 \uac80\uc0c9, \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ubc0f \uc228\uaca8\uc9c4 \uc885\uc18d \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub97c \uad6c\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5 \ubd84\ub958 \uccb4\uacc4;

We study this question empirically using data from Moltbook, an AI-agent-only social platform, with 800K posts, 3.5M comments, and 78K agent profiles. We combine lexical metrics (Jaccard specificity), embedding-based semantic similarity, and LLM-as-judge validation to characterize agent interaction quality. Our findings reveal agents produce diverse, well-formed text that creates the surface appearance of active discussion, but the substance is largely absent. Specifically, while most agents ($67.5\\%$) vary their output across contexts, $65\\%$ of comments share no distinguishing content vocabulary with the post they appear under, and information gain from additional comments decays rapidly. LLM judge based metrics classify the dominant comment types as spam ($28\\%$) and off-topic content ($22\\%$). Embedding-based semantic analysis confirms that lexically generic comments are also semantically generic.

Although verifier implementation is easier than solution annotation for many tasks, existing synthetic data generation methods remain largely solution-centric, while verifier-based methods rely on a few hand-crafted procedural environments. In this work, we scale RLVR by introducing ReSyn, a pipeline that generates diverse reasoning environments equipped with instance generators and verifiers, covering tasks such as constraint satisfaction, algorithmic puzzles, and spatial reasoning. A Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model trained with RL on ReSyn data achieves consistent gains across reasoning benchmarks and out-of-domain math benchmarks, including a 27\\% relative improvement on the challenging BBEH benchmark.

However, algorithmic progress has been limited since model-free methods are too high variance and exact methods scale poorly. Recent Hybrid Structural Methods (HSMs) use Monte Carlo rollouts for the common noise in combination with exact estimation of the expected return, conditioned on those samples. However, HSMs have not been scaled to Partially Observable settings. We propose Recurrent Structural Policy Gradient (RSPG), the first history-aware HSM for settings involving public information. We also introduce MFAX, our JAX-based framework for MFGs. By leveraging known transition dynamics, RSPG achieves state-of-the-art performance as well as an order-of-magnitude faster convergence and solves, for the first time, a macroeconomics MFG with heterogeneous agents, common noise and history-aware policies.
