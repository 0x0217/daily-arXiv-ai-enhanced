Radioactive watermarks -- marks that transfer to a model's outputs -- can help detect when such unauthorized data has been used for training. Moreover, aside from being radioactive, an effective watermark for protecting images from unauthorized training also needs to meet other existing requirements, such as imperceptibility, robustness, and multi-bit capacity. To overcome these challenges, we propose HMARK, a novel multi-bit watermarking scheme, which encodes ownership information as secret bits in the semantic-latent space (h-space) for image diffusion models. By leveraging the interpretability and semantic significance of h-space, ensuring that watermark signals correspond to meaningful semantic attributes, the watermarks embedded by HMARK exhibit radioactivity, robustness to distortions, and minimal impact on perceptual quality. Experimental results demonstrate that HMARK achieves 98.57% watermark detection accuracy, 95.07% bit-level recovery accuracy, 100% recall rate, and 1.0 AUC on images produced by the downstream adversarial model finetuned with LoRA on watermarked data across various types of distortions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub2e4\uc911 \ube44\ud2b8 \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud0b9 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud604\ub300\uc758 \uc0dd\uc131\uc801 \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uad8c\ud55c\uc774 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud55c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ud559\uc2b5 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uba70, \uc774\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ubb34\ub2e8 \uc0ac\uc6a9 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "HMARK\ub77c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ube44\ud2b8 \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud0b9 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \uc18c\uc720\uad8c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ube44\ubc00 \ube44\ud2b8\ub85c \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8-\uc7a0\uc7ac \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\ub3d9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "HMARK\ub294 98.57% \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud06c \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc640 95.07% \ube44\ud2b8 \uc218\uc900 \ubcf5\uad6c \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "HMARK\ub294 \uc65c\uace1\uc5d0 \uac15\ud558\uace0 \uc9c0\uac01 \ud488\uc9c8\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc774 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ub41c \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud604\ub300\uc758 \uc0dd\uc131\uc801 \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud55c \uc18c\uc720\uad8c\uc774\ub098 \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uad8c\ub9ac\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ub300\ud55c \ud559\uc2b5 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubc29\uc0ac\uc131 \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud06c\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ucd9c\ub825\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\uc774\ub418\ub294 \ud45c\uc2dc\ub85c, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb34\ub2e8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uc5c8\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc744 \uc904 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac8c\ub2e4\uac00 \ubc29\uc0ac\uc131\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \uac83 \uc678\uc5d0\ub3c4 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\uac00 \ubb34\ub2e8 \ud559\uc2b5\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ubcf4\ud638\ub418\ub294 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud06c\ub294 \uc778\uc2dd \ubd88\uac00\ub2a5\uc131, \uac15\uac74\uc131 \ubc0f \ub2e4\uc911 \ube44\ud2b8 \uc6a9\ub7c9\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \ucda9\uc871\ud574\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 HMARK\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub2e4\uc911 \ube44\ud2b8 \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud0b9 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc758\ubbf8-\uc7a0\uc7ac \uacf5\uac04(h-space)\uc5d0\uc11c \uc18c\uc720\uad8c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ube44\ubc00 \ube44\ud2b8\ub85c \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, this reliance on motifs makes GNNs vulnerable to adversarial netlist rewrites; even small-scale edits can mislead GNN predictions. Existing adversarial approaches, ranging from synthesis-recipe perturbations to gate transformations, come with high design overheads. We present NetDeTox, an automated end-to-end framework that orchestrates large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning (RL) in a systematic manner, enabling focused local rewriting. The RL agent identifies netlist components critical for GNN-based reasoning, while the LLM devises rewriting plans to diversify motifs that preserve functionality. Iterative feedback between the RL and LLM stages refines adversarial rewritings to limit overheads. Compared to the SOTA work AttackGNN, NetDeTox successfully degrades the effectiveness of all security schemes with fewer rewrites and substantially lower area overheads (reductions of 54.50% for GNN-RE, 25.44% for GNN4IP, and 41.04% for OMLA, respectively).

Today, the number of GPTs has reached three millions, with the range of specific expert domains becoming increasingly diverse. However, given the consistent framework shared among these LLM agent applications, systemic security vulnerabilities may exist and remain underexplored. To fill this gap, we present an empirical study on the security vulnerabilities of GPTs. Building upon prior research on LLM security, we first adopt a platform-user perspective to conduct a comprehensive attack surface analysis across different system components. Then, we design a systematic and multidimensional attack suite with the explicit objectives of information leakage and tool misuse based on the attack surface analysis, thereby concretely demonstrating the security vulnerabilities that various components of GPT-based systems face. Finally, we accordingly propose defense mechanisms to address the aforementioned security vulnerabilities. By increasing the awareness of these vulnerabilities and offering critical insights into their implications, this study seeks to facilitate the secure and responsible application of GPTs while contributing to developing robust defense mechanisms that protect users and systems against malicious attacks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 GPT\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548

Unlike technology-driven cryptocurrencies, their market dynamics are primarily shaped by viral social media diffusion, celebrity influence, and speculative capital inflows.\n  To capture the distinctive vulnerabilities of these ecosystems, we present the first Memecoin Ecosystem Fragility Framework (ME2F). ME2F formalizes memecoin risks in three dimensions: i) Volatility Dynamics Score capturing persistent and extreme price swings together with spillover from base chains; ii) Whale Dominance Score quantifying ownership concentration among top holders; and iii) Sentiment Amplification Score measuring the impact of attention-driven shocks on market stability.\n  We apply ME2F to representative tokens (over 65\\% market share) and show that fragility is not evenly distributed across the ecosystem. Politically themed tokens such as TRUMP, MELANIA, and LIBRA concentrate the highest risks, combining volatility, ownership concentration, and sensitivity to sentiment shocks. Established memecoins such as DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE fall into an intermediate range. Benchmark tokens ETH and SOL remain consistently resilient due to deeper liquidity and institutional participation. Our findings provide the first ecosystem-level evidence of memecoin fragility and highlight governance implications for enhancing market resilience in the Web3 era.", "AI": {"tldr": "Memecoin \uc0dd\ud0dc\uacc4\uc758 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \uba54\ubaa8\ucf54\uc778 \uc0dd\ud0dc\uacc4 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c(ME2F)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc815\uce58\uc801 \ud14c\ub9c8\uc758 \ud1a0\ud070\uc774 \uac00\uc7a5 \ub192\uc740 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc218\ubc18\ud568\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uba54\ubaa8\ucf54\uc778\uc740 \uc778\ud130\ub137 \ubb38\ud654\uc640 \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ud2f0 \uc8fc\ub3c4\uc758 \ub0b4\ub7ec\ud2f0\ube0c\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd9c\ud604\ud558\uc5ec \ub3c5\ud2b9\ud55c \uc554\ud638 \uc790\uc0b0 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4\ub85c \ube60\ub974\uac8c \ubc1c\uc804\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "method": "ME2F\ub294 \uba54\ubaa8\ucf54\uc778 \ub9ac\uc2a4\ud06c\ub97c \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ud615\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4: i) \uac00\uaca9 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uacfc \uae30\ubcf8 \uccb4\uc778\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130\uc758 \ud30c\uae09\ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc810\uc218, ii) \uc0c1\uc704 \ubcf4\uc720\uc790 \uac04\uc758 \uc18c\uc720 \uc9d1\uc911\uc131\uc744 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uace0\ub798 \uc9c0\ubc30 \uc810\uc218, iii) \uc2dc\uc7a5 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc8fc\ubaa9 \uae30\ubc18 \ucda9\uaca9\uc758 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uce21\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uac10\uc815 \uc99d\ud3ed \uc810\uc218.", "result": "ME2F\ub97c \ub300\ud45c \ud1a0\ud070\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, \uc0dd\ud0dc\uacc4 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc774 \uace0\ub974\uac8c \ubd84\ud3ec\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\ub2e4.

While offering immense potential, this vision also introduces novel and systemic risks to safety and security. Objectives: Unlike common threat-centric taxonomies, our survey provides a principled, architectural framework for engineering safe and reliable agentic systems. We aim to identify the architectural sources of vulnerabilities to establish a foundation for secure design. Methods: We perform a bottom-up deconstruction of agentic systems, treating each component as a dual-use interface. The analysis spans three levels of complexity: the foundational Single Agent, the collaborative Multi-Agent System (MAS), and the visionary Interoperable Multi-Agent System (IMAS). At each level, we identify core architectural components and their inherent security risks. Results & Conclusions: Our central finding is that agentic safety is an architectural principle, not an add-on. By identifying specific vulnerabilities and deriving mitigation principles at each level of the agentic stack, this survey serves as a foundational guide for building the capable, safe, and trustworthy AI needed to realize a secure Internet of Agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uad6c\ub3d9\ub418\ub294 \uc790\uc728

This makes automated fact-checking system necessary to ensure the safety and integrity of our online media ecosystem. Previous methods have demonstrated the effectiveness of decomposing the claim into simpler sub-tasks and utilizing LLM-based multi agent system to execute them. However, those models faces two limitations: they often fail to verify every component in the claim and lack of structured framework to logically connect the results of sub-tasks for a final prediction. In this work, we propose a novel automated fact-checking framework called Trification. Our framework begins by generating a comprehensive set of verification actions to ensure complete coverage of the claim. It then structured these actions into a dependency graph to model the logical interaction between actions. Furthermore, the graph can be dynamically modified, allowing the system to adapt its verification strategy. Experimental results on two challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances fact-checking accuracy, thereby advancing current state-of-the-art in automated fact-checking

Existing methods aim to overcome this so-called curse of dimensionality by carefully encoding structural assumptions, from locality to sparsity to smoothness, into the optimization procedure. Surprisingly, we demonstrate that these approaches are outperformed by arguably the simplest method imaginable: Bayesian linear regression. After applying a geometric transformation to avoid boundary-seeking behavior, Gaussian processes with linear kernels match state-of-the-art performance on tasks with 60- to 6,000-dimensional search spaces. Linear models offer numerous advantages over their non-parametric counterparts: they afford closed-form sampling and their computation scales linearly with data, a fact we exploit on molecular optimization tasks with > 20,000 observations. Coupled with empirical analyses, our results suggest the need to depart from past intuitions about BO methods in high-dimensional spaces.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uac00 \ub3c4\uc804\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc774 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uac00\uc815\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc808\ucc28\uc5d0 \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\ub824 \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \uc120\ud615 \ud68c\uadc0\uac00 \uac00\uc7a5 \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc758 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "method": "\uacbd\uacc4 \ucd94\uad6c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud53c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \ubcc0\ud658\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud55c \ud6c4, \uc120\ud615 \ucee4\ub110\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \uac00\uc6b0\uc2dc\uc548 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud588\ub2e4.", "result": "\uac00\uc6b0\uc2dc\uc548 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub294 60\ucc28\uc6d0\uc5d0\uc11c 6,000\ucc28\uc6d0\uae4c\uc9c0\uc758 \uac80\uc0c9 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uae30\uc874 \uc9c1\uad00\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc97\uc5b4\ub0a0 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \uacf5\uac04\uc740 \ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654(BO)\uc5d0 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc131, \ud76c\uc18c\uc131, \ub9e4\ub044\ub7ec\uc6c0 \ub4f1 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uac00\uc815\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc808\ucc28\uc5d0 \uc815\uad50\ud558\uac8c \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub180\ub78d\uac8c\ub3c4, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\ub4e4\uc774 \uc0c1\uc0c1\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac00\uc7a5 \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 \ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \uc120\ud615 \ud68c\uadc0\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ub5a8\uc5b4\uc9c4\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacbd\uacc4 \ucd94\uad6c \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud53c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \ubcc0\ud658\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud55c \ud6c4, \uc120\ud615 \ucee4\ub110\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \uac00\uc6b0\uc2dc\uc548 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\uac00 60\ucc28\uc6d0\uc5d0\uc11c 6,000\ucc28\uc6d0\uae4c\uc9c0\uc758 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc120\ud615 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ube44\ubaa8\uc218\uc801 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc774\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: \ub2eb\ud78c \ud615\ud0dc\uc758 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0, \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \uc120\ud615\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ub418\ub294 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 20,000\uac1c \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uad00\uce21\uce58\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \ubd84\uc790 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774 \uc0ac\uc2e4\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\uc99d \ubd84\uc11d\uacfc \uacb0\ud569\ub41c \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c BO \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacfc\uac70 \uc9c1\uad00\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc97\uc5b4\ub0a0 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, these models introduce novel safety and reliability risks, such as CoT-hijacking and prompt-induced inefficiencies, which are not fully captured by existing evaluation methods. To address this gap, we propose RT-LRM, a unified benchmark designed to assess the trustworthiness of LRMs. RT-LRM evaluates three core dimensions: truthfulness, safety and efficiency. Beyond metric-based evaluation, we further introduce the training paradigm as a key analytical perspective to investigate the systematic impact of different training strategies on model trustworthiness. We achieve this by designing a curated suite of 30 reasoning tasks from an observational standpoint. We conduct extensive experiments on 26 models and identify several valuable insights into the trustworthiness of LRMs. For example, LRMs generally face trustworthiness challenges and tend to be more fragile than Large Language Models (LLMs) when encountering reasoning-induced risks. These findings uncover previously underexplored vulnerabilities and highlight the need for more targeted evaluations.

However, the inherent logical complexity of authorization policies, combined with the scarcity of high-quality \"Natural Language-to-ODRL\" training datasets, impedes the ability of current methods to efficiently and accurately translate complex rules from natural language into the ODRL format. To address this challenge, this research leverages the potent comprehension and generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to achieve both automation and high fidelity in this translation process. We introduce AgentODRL, a multi-agent system based on an Orchestrator-Workers architecture. The architecture consists of specialized Workers, including a Generator for ODRL policy creation, a Decomposer for breaking down complex use cases, and a Rewriter for simplifying nested logical relationships. The Orchestrator agent dynamically coordinates these Workers, assembling an optimal pathway based on the complexity of the input use case. Specifically, we enhance the ODRL Generator by incorporating a validator-based syntax strategy and a semantic reflection mechanism powered by a LoRA-finetuned model, significantly elevating the quality of the generated policies. Extensive experiments were conducted on a newly constructed dataset comprising 770 use cases of varying complexity, all situated within the context of data spaces. The results, evaluated using ODRL syntax and semantic scores, demonstrate that our proposed Orchestrator-Workers system, enhanced with these strategies, achieves superior performance on the ODRL

However, they heavily rely on extracted content via OCR, which leads to numerical hallucinations when chart textual annotations are sparse. While existing methods focus on scaling instructions, they fail to address the fundamental challenge, i.e., reasoning with visual perception. In this paper, we identify a critical observation: MLLMs exhibit weak grounding in chart elements and proportional relationships, as evidenced by their inability to localize key positions to match their reasoning. To bridge this gap, we propose PointCoT, which integrates reflective interaction into chain-of-thought reasoning in charts. By prompting MLLMs to generate bounding boxes and re-render charts based on location annotations, we establish connections between textual reasoning steps and visual grounding regions. We further introduce an automated pipeline to construct ChartPoint-SFT-62k, a dataset featuring 19.2K high-quality chart samples with step-by-step CoT, bounding box, and re-rendered visualizations. Leveraging this data, we develop two instruction-tuned models, ChartPointQ2 and ChartPointQ2.5, which outperform state-of-the-art across several chart benchmarks, e.g., +5.04\\% on ChartBench.", "AI": {"tldr": "MLLMs\ub294 \ucc28\ud2b8 \uc774\ud574\uc5d0 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c\ub85c \ub5a0\uc624\ub974\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, OCR\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \ucf58\ud150\uce20 \ucd94\ucd9c\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc8fc\uc11d\uc774 \ud76c\ubc15\ud560 \ub54c \uc22b\uc790 \uc798\ubabb \ud574\uc11d \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \uc9c0\uac01\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \ucd94\ub860\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70, \uad50\ucc28 \uc8fc\uc81c \ubc18\uc601 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9(PointCoT) \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0 \ucc28\ud2b8 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8 ChartPoint-SFT-62k\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub41c \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "MLLMs\uc758 \ucc28\ud2b8 \ud574\uc11d \ub2a5\ub825\uacfc \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \uc778\uc2dd \uae30\ubc18 \ucd94\ub860 \uc0ac\uc774\uc758 \uac04\uadf9\uc744 \ud574\uc18c\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "PointCoT\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \ucc28\ud2b8 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uccb4\uc778 \uc624\ube0c \uc18c\uc0ac\uc774\uc5b4\ud2f0(Chain-of-Thought) \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0 \ubc18\uc601 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "ChartPointQ2 \ubc0f ChartPointQ2.5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ucc28\ud2b8 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "PointCoT \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 MLLMs\uc758 \ucc28\ud2b8 \ud574\uc11d \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(MLLMs)\uc740 \ucc28\ud2b8 \uc774\ud574\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c\ub85c \ub5a0\uc624\ub974\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub4e4\uc740 OCR\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \ucf58\ud150\uce20 \ucd94\ucd9c\uc5d0 \ud06c\uac8c \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \ucc28\ud2b8\uc758 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc8fc\uc11d\uc774 \ud76c\ubc15\ud560 \uacbd\uc6b0 \uc22b\uc790 \ucc29\uac01 \ud604\uc0c1\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uc9c0\uce68 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \uc9c0\uac01\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ucd94\ub860\ud558\ub294 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 MLLMs\uac00 \ucc28\ud2b8 \uc694\uc18c\uc640 \ube44\uc728 \uad00\uacc4\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc57d\ud55c \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \ubcf4\uc774\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uad00\ucc30\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud0a4 \ud3ec\uc9c0\uc158\uc744 \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc2e4\ud328\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \uc785\uc99d\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uc18c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ucc28\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uccb4\uc778 \uc624\ube0c \uc0ac\uace0(Chain-of-Thought) \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0 \ubc18\uc601 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 PointCoT\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

While scripted agents offer predictability and consistency in controlled environments, they fall short in dynamic, complex scenarios due to their inherent inflexibility. Conversely, RL agents excel in adaptability and learning, offering potential improvements in handling unforeseen situations, but suffer from significant challenges such as black-box decision-making processes and scalability issues in larger simulation environments. This paper introduces a novel hierarchical hybrid artificial intelligence (AI) approach that synergizes the reliability and predictability of scripted agents with the dynamic, adaptive learning capabilities of RL. By structuring the AI system hierarchically, the proposed approach aims to utilize scripted agents for routine, tactical-level decisions and RL agents for higher-level, strategic decision-making, thus addressing the limitations of each method while leveraging their individual strengths. This integration is shown to significantly improve overall performance, providing a robust, adaptable, and effective solution for developing and training intelligent agents in complex simulation environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uaddc\uce59 \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \uc2ec\uce35 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc804\ud22c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c \uaddc\uce59 \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc608\uce21 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uacfc \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub3d9\uc801 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\uc5f0\uc131\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uacc4\uce35\uc801\uc73c\ub85c AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uc77c\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \uc804\uc220 \uacb0\uc815\uc5d0 \uc2a4\ud06c\ub9bd\ud2b8 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c, \ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub192\uc740 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \uacb0\uc815\uc5d0 RL \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774 \ud1b5\ud569\uc740 \uc804\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf1c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c0\ub2a5\ud615 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uace0 \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uac01 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uace0 \uac1c\ubcc4 \uac15\uc810\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uace0 \uc720\uc5f0\ud55c AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc804\ud22c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c0\ub2a5\ud615 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc740 \uc8fc\ub85c \uaddc\uce59 \uae30\ubc18 \uc2a4\ud06c\ub9bd\ud2b8 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc73c\ub85c \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc9c0\uc5b4\uc84c\uc73c\uba70, \ucd5c\uadfc\uc5d0\uc57c \uc2ec\uce35 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL) \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \ub3c4\uc785\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc2a4\ud06c\ub9bd\ud2b8 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \ud1b5\uc81c\ub41c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc608\uce21 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uacfc \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub0b4\uc7ac\ub41c \ube44\uc720\uc5f0\uc131 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \ub3d9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4. \ubc18\uba74, RL \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc801\uc751\uc131\uacfc \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\ud558\uc5ec \uc608\uae30\uce58 \uc54a\uc740 \uc0c1\ud669\uc744 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uac1c\uc120 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ube14\ub799 \ubc15\uc2a4 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815 \ubc0f \ub354 \ud070 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud655\uc7a5\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc2a4\ud06c\ub9bd\ud2b8 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uacfc \uc608\uce21 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131, RL\uc758 \ub3d9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5(AI) \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uacc4\uce35\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uc77c\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \uc804\uc220\uc801 \uacb0\uc815\uc5d0\ub294 \uc2a4\ud06c\ub9bd\ud2b8 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c, \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \uacb0\uc815\uc5d0\ub294 RL \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac01 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uac1c\ubcc4\uc801\uc778 \uac15\uc810\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud1b5\ud569\uc740 \uc804\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf1c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c0\ub2a5\ud615 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uace0 \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

This paper presents the first comparative analysis between blockchain-based and traditional database systems for managing digital twin evidence in forensic investigations. We conducted controlled experiments comparing the Ethereum blockchain with IPFS storage against traditional SQL databases for digital twin evidence management. Our findings reveal that while blockchain provides superior data integrity and immutability, crucial for forensic applications, traditional databases offer better performance consistency. The blockchain implementation showed faster average storage times but higher variability in retrieval operations. Both systems maintained forensic integrity through hash verification, though blockchain's immutable nature provides additional security guarantees essential for legal proceedings.

While AgentNet demonstrated the feasibility of fully decentralized coordination through dynamic DAG topologies, several limitations remain: scalability challenges with large agent populations, communication overhead, lack of privacy guarantees, and suboptimal resource allocation. We propose AgentNet++, a hierarchical decentralized framework that extends AgentNet with multilevel agent organization, privacy-preserving knowledge sharing via differential privacy and secure aggregation, adaptive resource management, and theoretical convergence guarantees. Our approach introduces cluster-based hierarchies where agents self-organize into specialized groups, enabling efficient task routing and knowledge distillation while maintaining full decentralization. We provide formal analysis of convergence properties and privacy bounds, and demonstrate through extensive experiments on complex multi-agent tasks that AgentNet++ achieves 23% higher task completion rates, 40% reduction in communication overhead, and maintains strong privacy guarantees compared to AgentNet and other baselines. Our framework scales effectively to 1000+ agents while preserving the emergent intelligence properties of the original AgentNet.", "AI": {"tldr": "AgentNet++\ub294 \ub2e4\uce35 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc870\uc9c1\uacfc \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc \ubcf4\uc7a5 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uacf5\uc720\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud611\uc5c5\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ubd84\uc0b0 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \uc790\uc728\uc801 \ud611\uc5c5\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubd84\uc0b0 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uace0, \uae30\uc874 AgentNet\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub2e4\uce35 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc870\uc9c1, \ucc28\ub4f1 \ud504\ub77c\uc774\ubc84\uc2dc \ubc0f \uc548\uc804\ud55c \uc9d1\uacc4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \uc9c0\uc2dd \uacf5\uc720, \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc790\uc6d0 \uad00\ub9ac, \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc218\ub834 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ubd84\uc0b0 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "AgentNet++\ub294 \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc644\ub8cc\uc728(23% \ud5a5\uc0c1), \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc \uac10\uc18c(40% \uac10\uc18c) \ubc0f \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "AgentNet++\ub294 1000\uac1c \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ub418\uba70 \uc6d0\ub798 AgentNet\uc758 emergent intelligence \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubd84\uc0b0 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04 \uc790\uc728\uc801 \ud611\uc5c5\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\ub2e4.

Model is available at https://huggingface.co/Freakz3z/Qwen-JSON", "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language generation and reasoning. However, their integration into automated software ecosystems is often hindered by the \"Structure Gap\" - the inherent tension between the probabilistic nature of token generation and the deterministic requirements of structured data formats (e.g., JSON, XML). Traditional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) often fails to enforce strict syntactic constraints, leading to \"hallucinated\" keys or malformed structures, while constrained decoding methods impose significant inference latency. In this paper, we propose a lightweight, efficient Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework to bridge this gap. We introduce a novel Multi-dimensional Reward Function that decomposes the structured output task into a hierarchy of constraints: structural integrity, format correctness, content accuracy, and validity. Leveraging Gradient Regularized Policy Optimization (GRPO), we enable the model to internalize these constraints without the need for a separate critic network, reducing peak VRAM usage by 40% compared to PPO. We validate our approach on multiple tasks, including complex recipe generation and structured math reasoning (GSM8K-JSON). Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves 89.7% structural accuracy and 92.1% JSON validity, significantly outperforming both zero-shot baselines (e.g., GPT-3.5) and SFT on larger models like LLaMA-3-8B. Furthermore, we provide a detailed analysis of training dynamics, revealing a distinct self-paced curriculum where the model sequentially acquires syntactic proficiency before semantic accuracy.

While efforts have been made to transfer the success of the foundation models in general AI domains to biology, existing works focus on directly adopting the existing foundation model architectures from general machine learning domains without a systematic design considering the unique physicochemical and structural properties of each biological data modality. This leads to suboptimal performance, as these repurposed architectures struggle to capture the long-range dependencies, sparse information, and complex underlying ``grammars'' inherent to biological data. To address this gap, we introduce BioArc, a novel framework designed to move beyond intuition-driven architecture design towards principled, automated architecture discovery for biological foundation models. Leveraging Neural Architecture Search (NAS), BioArc systematically explores a vast architecture design space, evaluating architectures across multiple biological modalities while rigorously analyzing the interplay between architecture, tokenization, and training strategies. This large-scale analysis identifies novel, high-performance architectures, allowing us to distill a set of empirical design principles to guide future model development.

In this paper, we present IntentGuard, a general defense framework based on instruction-following intent analysis. The key insight of IntentGuard is that the decisive factor in IPIAs is not the presence of malicious text, but whether the LLM intends to follow instructions from untrusted data. Building on this insight, IntentGuard leverages an instruction-following intent analyzer (IIA) to identify which parts of the input prompt the model recognizes as actionable instructions, and then flag or neutralize any overlaps with untrusted data segments. To instantiate the framework, we develop an IIA that uses three \"thinking intervention\" strategies to elicit a structured list of intended instructions from reasoning-enabled LLMs. These techniques include start-of-thinking prefilling, end-of-thinking refinement, and adversarial in-context demonstration. We evaluate IntentGuard on two agentic benchmarks (AgentDojo and Mind2Web) using two reasoning-enabled LLMs (Qwen-3-32B and gpt-oss-20B). Results demonstrate that IntentGuard achieves (1) no utility degradation in all but one setting and (2) strong robustness against adaptive prompt injection attacks (e.g., reducing attack success rates from 100% to 8.5% in a Mind2Web scenario).", "AI": {"tldr": "Indirect prompt injection attacks are a significant threat to LLM-based agents, and IntentGuard offers a defense framework that minimizes their impact by analyzing intent behind instructions.", "motivation": "LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \uac04\uc811 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc8fc\uc785 \uacf5\uaca9(IPIA)\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ubcf4\ud638\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "IntentGuard\ub294 \uc9c0\uce68 \ub530\ub974\uae30 \uc758\ub3c4 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18 \ubc29\uc5b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \ube44\uc2e0\ub8b0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc9c0\uce68 \ub530\ub974\uae30\ub97c \uc758\ub3c4\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\uc758 \uc5ec\ubd80\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc5ec \uc791\ub3d9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "IntentGuard\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud558\uba70, \uacf5\uaca9 \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \ud604\uc800\ud788 \uc904\uc778\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "IntentGuard\ub294 LLM\uc774 \ube44\uc2e0\ub8b0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uc9c0\uce68\uc744 \ub530\ub974\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub3c4\ub85d \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubc29\uc5b4\ud558\uba70, \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\ud2f8\ub9ac\ud2f0 \uc800\ud558 \uc5c6\uc774 Robust\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac04\uc811 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \uc8fc\uc785 \uacf5\uaca9(IPIA)\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc774 \uc785\ub825 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \uc228\uaca8\uc9c4 \uc545\uc758\uc801\uc778 \uc9c0\uce68\uc744 \ub530\ub974\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c, LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc704\ud611\uc744 \uc81c\uae30\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc9c0\uce68 \ub530\ub974\uae30 \uc758\ub3c4 \ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18 \ubc29\uc5b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 IntentGuard\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, the task performance and efficiency are fundamentally constrained by their collaboration strategies. Prevailing approaches rely on static topologies and centralized global planning, a paradigm that limits their scalability and adaptability in open, decentralized networks. Effective collaboration planning in distributed systems using only local information thus remains a formidable challenge. To address this, we propose BiRouter, a novel dual-criteria routing method for Self-Organizing Multi-Agent Systems (SO-MAS). This method enables each agent to autonomously execute ``next-hop'' task routing at runtime, relying solely on local information. Its core decision-making mechanism is predicated on balancing two metrics: (1) the ImpScore, which evaluates a candidate agent's long-term importance to the overall goal, and (2) the GapScore, which assesses its contextual continuity for the current task state. Furthermore, we introduce a dynamically updated reputation mechanism to bolster system robustness in untrustworthy environments and have developed a large-scale, cross-domain dataset, comprising thousands of annotated task-routing paths, to enhance the model's generalization.

This design struggles in complex domains such as digital signal processing (DSP), where tutors must maintain coherent long-term student models, manage heterogeneous knowledge bases, and adapt teaching strategies over extended interactions. We argue that retrieval, memory, and control should be treated as a coupled cognitive evolution process. We instantiate this view in CogEvo-Edu, a hierarchical educational multi-agent system comprising a Cognitive Perception Layer (CPL), a Knowledge Evolution Layer (KEL), and a Meta-Control Layer (MCL). CPL maintains dual memories and performs confidence-weighted consolidation to build structured, self-correcting student profiles under limited context. KEL assigns each knowledge chunk a spatiotemporal value that drives activation, semantic compression, and forgetting. MCL formulates tutoring as hierarchical sequential decision making, orchestrating specialized agents and jointly adapting CPL/KEL hyperparameters via a dual inner--outer loop. To evaluate CogEvo-Edu, we construct DSP-EduBench, a vertical benchmark for DSP tutoring with heterogeneous resources, simulated student profiles, and long-horizon interaction scripts. Using a three-model LLM-as-a-Judge ensemble, CogEvo-Edu raises the overall score from 5.32 to 9.23 and improves all six indicators over static RAG, simple memory, and a single-agent variant, demonstrating the value of jointly evolving student profiles, knowledge bases, and teaching policies.", "AI": {"tldr": "CogEvo-Edu\ub294 STEM \uad50\uc721\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ub300\ud654\ud615 \ud29c\ud130\ub9c1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc73c\ub85c, \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \ud559\uc0dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uae30\ubc18\uc744 \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc744 \uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c STEM \uad50\uc721 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc801\uc751\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ud29c\ud130\ub9c1 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131.", "method": "CogEvo-Edu\ub294 \uc778\uc9c0\uc801 \uc778\uc2dd \uce35, \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc9c4\ud654 \uce35, \uba54\ud0c0 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uce35\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uad6c\ud604\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "CogEvo-Edu\ub294 DSP \ud29c\ud130\ub9c1\uc5d0\uc11c \uc804\uccb4 \uc810\uc218\ub97c 5.32\uc5d0\uc11c 9.23\ub85c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0, \uc815\uc801 RAG\uc640 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubcc0\ud615\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc9c0\ud45c\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf30\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ud559\uc0dd \ud504\ub85c\ud544, \uc9c0\uc2dd \uae30\ubc18 \ubc0f \uad50\uc218 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uacf5\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c4\ud654\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ud29c\ud130\ub9c1\uc758 \uac00\uce58\uac00 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 STEM \uad50\uc721\uc5d0\uc11c \ub300\ud654\ud615 \ud29c\ud130\ub85c \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc774 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uac15\uc758 \uc790\ub8cc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc815\uc801\uc778 \uac80\uc0c9 \uc99d\uac15 \uc0dd\uc131(RAG) \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub2e8\uc77c LLM\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc124\uacc4\ub294 \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uc2e0\ud638 \ucc98\ub9ac(DSP)\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud29c\ud130\ub294 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uc7a5\uae30 \ud559\uc0dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uae30\ubc18\uc744 \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\uba70 \uc7a5\uae30 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uad50\uc218 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud574\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac80\uc0c9, \uae30\uc5b5 \ubc0f \uc81c\uc5b4\uac00 \uacb0\ud569\ub41c \uc778\uc9c0\uc801 \uc9c4\ud654 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\ub85c \uac04\uc8fc\ub418\uc5b4\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc778\uc9c0 \uc778\uc2dd \uce35(CPL), \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc9c4\ud654 \uce35(KEL) \ubc0f \uba54\ud0c0 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uce35(MCL)\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \uacc4\uce35\uc801 \uad50\uc721 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc778 CogEvo-Edu\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774 \uad00\uc810\uc744 \uad6c\ud604\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Leveraging on balance theory that deduces edge signs from multi-hop node pairs, signed graph learning can generate node embeddings that preserve both structural and sign information. However, training on sensitive signed graphs raises significant privacy concerns, as model parameters may leak private link information. Existing protection methods with differential privacy (DP) typically rely on edge or gradient perturbation for unsigned graph protection. Yet, they are not well-suited for signed graphs, mainly because edge perturbation tends to cascading errors in edge sign inference under balance theory, while gradient perturbation increases sensitivity due to node interdependence and gradient polarity change caused by sign flips, resulting in larger noise injection. In this paper, motivated by the robustness of adversarial learning to noisy interactions, we present ASGL, a privacy-preserving adversarial signed graph learning method that preserves high utility while achieving node-level DP. We first decompose signed graphs into positive and negative subgraphs based on edge signs, and then design a gradient-perturbed adversarial module to approximate the true signed connectivity distribution. In particular, the gradient perturbation helps mitigate cascading errors, while the subgraph separation facilitates sensitivity reduction. Further, we devise a constrained breadth-first search tree strategy that fuses with balance theory to identify the edge signs between generated node pairs. This strategy also enables gradient decoupling, thereby effectively lowering gradient sensitivity. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that ASGL achieves favorable privacy-utility trade-offs across multiple downstream tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc11c\uba85

However, their immersive and personalized nature, combined with technical vulnerabilities, raises significant safety concerns. Despite their popularity, a systematic evaluation of their safety has been notably absent. To address this gap, we conduct the first large-scale safety study of AI character platforms, evaluating 16 popular platforms using a benchmark set of 5,000 questions across 16 safety categories. Our findings reveal a critical safety deficit: AI character platforms exhibit an average unsafe response rate of 65.1%, substantially higher than the 17.7% average rate of the baselines. We further discover that safety performance varies significantly across different characters and is strongly correlated with character features such as demographics and personality. Leveraging these insights, we demonstrate that our machine learning model is able identify less safe characters with an F1-score of 0.81. This predictive capability can be beneficial for platforms, enabling improved mechanisms for safer interactions, character search/recommendations, and character creation.

Developing computational scientific software from natural-language queries remains challenging broadly due to (a) sparse representation of domain codes during training and (b) the limited feasibility of RLHF with a small expert community. To address these limitations, this work conceptualizes an inverse approach to code design, embodied in the Chain of Unit-Physics framework: a first-principles (or primitives)-centric, multi-agent system in which human expert knowledge is encoded as unit-physics tests that explicitly constrain code generation. The framework is evaluated on a nontrivial combustion task, used here as a representative benchmark for scientific problem with realistic physical constraints. Closed-weight systems and code-focused agentic variants fail to produce correct end-to-end solvers, despite tool and web access, exhibiting four recurrent error classes: interface (syntax/API) hallucinations, overconfident assumptions, numerical/physical incoherence, and configuration fragility. Open-weight models with chain-of-thought (CoT) decoding reduce interface errors but still yield incorrect solutions. On the benchmark task, the proposed framework converges within 5-6 iterations, matches the human-expert implementation (mean error of $3.1\\times10^{-3}$ %), with a $\\sim$33.4 % faster runtime and a $\\sim$30 % efficient memory usage at a cost comparable to mid-sized commercial APIs, yielding a practical template for physics-grounded scientific code generation. As datasets and models evolve, zero-shot code accuracy will improve; however, the Chain of Unit-Physics framework goes further by embedding first-principles analysis that is foundational to scientific codes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc790\uc728 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0dd\uc131\uae30\uc778 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c

Certainly. Yet such progress is not an unalloyed blessing but rather a Trojan horse: behind their performance leaps lie more insidious and destructive safety risks, namely deception. Unlike hallucination, which arises from insufficient capability and leads to mistakes, deception represents a deeper threat in which models deliberately mislead users through complex reasoning and insincere responses. As system capabilities advance, deceptive behaviours have spread from textual to multimodal settings, amplifying their potential harm. First and foremost, how can we monitor these covert multimodal deceptive behaviors? Nevertheless, current research remains almost entirely confined to text, leaving the deceptive risks of multimodal large language models unexplored. In this work, we systematically reveal and quantify multimodal deception risks, introducing MM-DeceptionBench, the first benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate multimodal deception. Covering six categories of deception, MM-DeceptionBench characterizes how models strategically manipulate and mislead through combined visual and textual modalities. On the other hand, multimodal deception evaluation is almost a blind spot in existing methods. Its stealth, compounded by visual-semantic ambiguity and the complexity of cross-modal reasoning, renders action monitoring and chain-of-thought monitoring largely ineffective. To tackle this challenge, we propose debate with images, a novel multi-agent debate monitor framework. By compelling models to ground their claims in visual evidence, this method substantially improves the detectability of deceptive strategies. Experiments show that it consistently increases agreement with human judgements across all tested models, boosting Cohen's kappa by 1.5x and accuracy by 1.25x on GPT-4o.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ucd5c\uc2e0 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub41c \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \uc548\uc804 \uc704\ud5d8, \ud2b9\ud788 \uae30\ub9cc\uc744 \ub3d9\ubc18\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911\ubaa8\ub2ec \uae30\ub9cc \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uccab \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc778 MM-DeceptionBench\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uae30\ubc18 \ud1a0\ub860 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ucd5c\uc2e0 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub428\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc228\uaca8\uc9c4 \uae30\ub9cc\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9\uc774 \uc874\uc7ac\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c.", "method": "MM-DeceptionBench\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc911\ubaa8\ub2ec \uae30\ub9cc \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ub17c\uc7c1 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\ub9cc \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ud0d0\uc9c0.", "result": "\ub2e4\uc911\ubaa8\ub2ec \uae30\ub9cc \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uace0 \uc218\ub7c9\ud654\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc81c\uc548\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc778\uac04\uc758 \ud310\ub2e8\uacfc\uc758 \uc77c\uce58\ub3c4\ub97c \uc720\uc758\ubbf8\ud558\uac8c \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0b4.", "conclusion": "MM-DeceptionBench \ubc0f \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uae30\ubc18 \ub17c\uc7c1 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uae30\ub9cc\uc801 \ud589\ub3d9 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\uc5d0 \ud070 \uae30\uc5ec\ub97c \ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucd5c\uc804\uc120 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \ub354 \ub2a5\ub825\ud574\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub294\uac00?

However, traditional KT methods face fundamental limitations in explainability, as they rely solely on the response correctness, neglecting the rich information embedded in students' problem-solving processes. To address this gap, we propose Knowledge Tracing Leveraging Problem-Solving Process (KT-PSP), which incorporates students' problem-solving processes to capture the multidimensional aspects of mathematical proficiency. We also introduce KT-PSP-25, a new dataset specifically designed for the KT-PSP. Building on this, we present StatusKT, a KT framework that employs a teacher-student-teacher three-stage LLM pipeline to extract students' MP as intermediate signals. In this pipeline, the teacher LLM first extracts problem-specific proficiency indicators, then a student LLM generates responses based on the student's solution process, and a teacher LLM evaluates these responses to determine mastery of each indicator.

However, the actual capability of LLMs in JavaScript vulnerability detection remains questionable, necessitating systematic evaluation and comprehensive benchmarks. Unfortunately, existing benchmarks suffer from three critical limitations: (1) incomplete coverage, such as covering a limited subset of CWE types; (2) underestimation of LLM capabilities caused by unreasonable ground truth labeling; and (3) overestimation due to unrealistic cases such as using isolated vulnerable files rather than complete projects.\n  In this paper, we introduce, for the first time, three principles for constructing a benchmark for JavaScript vulnerability detection that directly address these limitations: (1) comprehensiveness, (2) no underestimation, and (3) no overestimation. Guided by these principles, we propose FORGEJS, the first automatic benchmark generation framework for evaluating LLMs' capability in JavaScript vulnerability detection. Then, we use FORGEJS to construct ARENAJS-the first systematic benchmark for LLM-based JavaScript vulnerability detection-and further propose JUDGEJS, an automatic evaluation framework.\n  We conduct the first systematic evaluation of LLMs for JavaScript vulnerability detection, leveraging JUDGEJS to assess seven popular commercial LLMs on ARENAJS. The results show that LLMs not only exhibit limited reasoning capabilities, but also suffer from severe robustness defects, indicating that reliable JavaScript vulnerability detection with LLMs remains an open challenge.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 JavaScript \ucde8\uc57d\uc810 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \uad6c\ucd95 \uc6d0\uce59\uacfc FORGEJS\ub77c\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \uc0dd\uc131 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uace0, LLM\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uace0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "JavaScript \ucde8\uc57d\uc810 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uc5d0\uc11c LLM\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \ub2a5\ub825\uc740 \uc758\ubb38\uc774 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \ud3c9\uac00\uc640 \uc885\ud569\uc801\uc778 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "FORGEJS\ub77c\ub294 \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \uc790\ub3d9 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \uc0dd\uc131 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec LLM\uc758 JavaScript \ucde8\uc57d\uc810 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0, ARENAJS\ub77c\ub294 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uba70, JUDGEJS\ub77c\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9 \ud3c9\uac00 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "LLM\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \uacac\uace0\uc131 \uacb0\ud568\uc774 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 JavaScript \ucde8\uc57d\uc810 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub97c \uc704\ud55c LLM\uc758 \ud65c\uc6a9\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ud574\uacb0\ud574\uc57c \ud560 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc5f0\uad6c\uc790\ub4e4\uc740 JavaScript\uc5d0\uc11c \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub9ce\uc740 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud588\uc73c\uba70, \ud2b9\ud788 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc744 \ubc1b\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ub9ce\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 JavaScript \ucde8\uc57d\uc810 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c LLM\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \ub2a5\ub825\uc740 \uc758\ubb38\uc774\ubbc0\ub85c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \ud3c9\uac00\uc640 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \ubd88\ud589\ud788\ub3c4 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \ud55c\uacc4\uc810\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4: (1) \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c CWE \uc720\ud615\ub9cc\uc744 \ud3ec\uad04\ud558\ub294 \ubd88\uc644\uc804\ud55c \ucee4\ubc84\ub9ac\uc9c0, (2) \ube44\ud569\ub9ac\uc801\uc778 \uc9c4\uc2e4 \ub808\uc774\ube14\ub9c1\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud55c LLM \ub2a5\ub825\uc758 \uacfc\uc18c\ud3c9\uac00, (3) \uc804\uccb4 \ud504\ub85c\uc81d\ud2b8\uac00 \uc544\ub2cc \uaca9\ub9ac\ub41c \ucde8\uc57d\ud55c \ud30c\uc77c\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ube44\ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \uc0ac\ub840\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uacfc\ub300\ud3c9\uac00. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c JavaScript \ucde8\uc57d\uc810 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \uad6c\ucd95 \uc6d0\uce59 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0: (1) \ud3ec\uad04\uc131, (2) \uacfc\uc18c\ud3c9\uac00 \uc5c6\uc74c, (3) \uacfc\ub300\ud3c9\uac00 \uc5c6\uc74c\uc744 \ucc98\uc74c\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc6d0\uce59\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 LLM\uc758 JavaScript \ucde8\uc57d\uc810 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \uc790\ub3d9 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c \uc0dd\uc131 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 FORGEJS\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7f0 \ub2e4\uc74c FORGEJS\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec LLM \uae30\ubc18 JavaScript \ucde8\uc57d\uc810 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc778 ARENAJS\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uace0, \uc790\ub3d9 \ud3c9\uac00 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c JUDGEJS\ub97c \ucd94\uac00\ub85c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 JUDGEJS\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec ARENAJS\uc5d0\uc11c 7\uac1c\uc758 \uc778\uae30 \uc0c1\uc5c5\uc801 LLM\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uba70 LLM\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4. \uadf8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 LLM\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc77c \ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \uacac\uace0\uc131 \uacb0\ud568\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc5b4 LLM\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 JavaScript \ucde8\uc57d\uc810 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub294 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ud574\uacb0\ud574\uc57c \ud560 \ubb38\uc81c\uc784\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b8\ub2e4."}}

However, existing frameworks fail to adequately support large-scale simulation development due to inherent limitations in adaptability, configurability, reliability, and code reusability. For example, they cannot simulate a society where the agent population and profiles change over time. To fill this gap, we propose Agent-Kernel, a framework built upon a novel society-centric modular microkernel architecture. It decouples core system functions from simulation logic and separates cognitive processes from physical environments and action execution. Consequently, Agent-Kernel achieves superior adaptability, configurability, reliability, and reusability. We validate the framework's superiority through two distinct applications: a simulation of the Universe 25 (Mouse Utopia) experiment, which demonstrates the handling of rapid population dynamics from birth to death; and a large-scale simulation of the Zhejiang University Campus Life, successfully coordinating 10,000 heterogeneous agents, including students and faculty.", "AI": {"tldr":

In collecting human feedback, however, preference flipping is ubiquitous and causes corruption in data annotation; the issue necessitates the alignment algorithms with improved robustness against potential flipped pairs. To this end, this paper introduces a Flipping-Aware Direct Preference Optimization (FA-DPO) algorithm tailored to preference flipping from a reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) perspective. We dissect the inherent human intention model and the preference flipping mechanism introduced by external factors as two distinct stages; in the latter, we introduce an instance-dependent flipping probability on the basis of the Bradley-Terry (BT) model. Further, by leveraging features relevant to preference annotation, we capture uncertainty in judgments and model preference flipping patterns. In practice, we design a simple yet efficient iterative optimization algorithm compatible with the original RLHF and DPO algorithms. In our experiments, we investigate the instance-dependent preference flipping model under multiple circumstances for evaluation of our proposed method, as well as other baseline methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc120\ud638\ub3c4 \uc804\ud658\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc800\ud56d\ub825\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud55c Flipping-Aware Direct Preference Optimization (FA-DPO) \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc758 \ud488\uc9c8\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uc815\ub82c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud558\uba70, \uc778\uac04 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \uc218\uc9d1 \uc2dc \uc120\ud638\ub3c4 \uc804\ud658\uc774 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc774\uc5b4\uc11c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc8fc\uc11d\uc5d0 \uc624\uc5fc\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "FA-DPO \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \uc778\uac04 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RLHF) \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \uc120\ud638\ub3c4 \uc804\ud658\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucdb0\uc838 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ube0c\ub798\ub4e4\ub9ac-\ud14c\ub9ac(BT) \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4 \uc758\uc874\uc801\uc778 \uc804\ud658 \ud655\ub960\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc \ub2e4\ub978 \uae30\uc900\uc120 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \uc9c4\ud589\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \uae30\uc874\uc758 RLHF \ubc0f DPO \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uacfc \ud638\ud658\ub418\ub294 \uac04\ub2e8\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ubc18\ubcf5 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud588\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc758 \ud488\uc9c8\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uc815\ub82c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc778\uac04 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \uc218\uc9d1\ud558\ub294 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc120\ud638\ub3c4 \uc804\ud658\uc774 \ub9cc\uc5f0\ud558\uac8c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uba70 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc8fc\uc11d\uc5d0 \uc624\uc5fc\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \uc804\ud658 \uc30d\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uac1c\uc120\ub41c \uac15\uc778\uc131\uc744 \uac16\ucd98 \uc815\ub82c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud568\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uacfc \uc778\uac04 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31(RLHF) \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \uc120\ud638\ub3c4 \uc804\ud658\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucd98 Flipping-Aware Direct Preference Optimization (FA-DPO) \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uace0\uc720\ud55c \uc778\uac04 \uc758\ub3c4 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uc678\ubd80 \uc694\uc778\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc120\ud638\ub3c4 \uc804\ud658 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubcc4\ub3c4\uc758 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud6c4\uc790\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ube0c\ub798\ub4e4\ub9ac-\ud14c\ub9ac(BT) \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4 \uc758\uc874\uc801\uc778 \uc804\ud658 \ud655\ub960\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uc120\ud638\ub3c4 \uc8fc\uc11d\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ub41c \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud310\ub2e8\uc758 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uace0 \uc120\ud638\ub3c4 \uc804\ud658 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\uc81c\ub85c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uae30\uc874\uc758 RLHF \ubc0f DPO \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uacfc \ud638\ud658\ub418\ub294 \uac04\ub2e8\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ubc18\ubcf5 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc \ub2e4\ub978 \uae30\uc900\uc120 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4 \uc758\uc874\uc801\uc778 \uc120\ud638\ub3c4 \uc804\ud658 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

This paper initiates a theoretical investigation on the prediction performance of a two-stage learning framework combining offline and online algorithms for a class of nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems. For the offline-learning phase, we establish an upper bound on the generalization error for approximate nonlinear-least-squares estimation under general datasets with strong correlation and distribution shift, leveraging the Kullback-Leibler divergence to quantify the distributional discrepancies. For the online-adaptation phase, we address, on the basis of the offline-trained model, the possible uncertain parameter drift in real-world target systems by proposing a meta-LMS prediction algorithm. This two-stage framework, integrating offline learning with online adaptation, demonstrates superior prediction performances compared with either purely offline or online methods.

This approach examines end-to-end security properties of entire systems, rather than AI models in isolation. While we recognize that hardening a single model is useful, it is important to realize that it is often insufficient. By way of an analogy, creating a model that is always helpful and harmless is akin to creating software that is always helpful and harmless. The collective experience of decades of cybersecurity research and practice shows that this is insufficient. Rather, constructing an informed and realistic attacker model before building a system, applying hard-earned lessons from software security, and continuous improvement of security posture is a tried-and-tested approach to securing real computer systems. A key goal is to examine where research challenges arise when applying traditional security principles in the context of AI agents. A secondary goal of this report is to distill these ideas for AI and ML practitioners and researchers. We discuss the challenges of applying security principles to agentic computing, present 11 case studies of real attacks on agentic systems, and define a series of new research problems specific to the security of agentic systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548 \ubc0f \uac1c\uc778\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub2e8\uae30 \ubc0f \uc7a5\uae30 \uc5f0\uad6c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ucef4\ud4e8\ud130 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ubcf4\uc548\uc758 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \uc124\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548\uacfc \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ucef4\ud4e8\ud130 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ubcf4\uc548\uc758 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0, \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc6d0\uce59\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub370\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc5f0\uad6c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uad6c\uccb4\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "11\uac1c\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \uacf5\uaca9 \uc0ac\ub840\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc815\uc758\ud558\uace0 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc5f0\uad6c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc815\ubcf4\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \uacf5\uaca9\uc790 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc218\ub9bd\ud558\uace0 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ubcf4\uc548 \ud0dc\uc138 \uac1c\uc120\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uc5ed\uc124\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud130 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ubcf4\uc548\uc758 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubcf4\uc548 \ubc0f \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub2e8\uae30 \ubc0f \uc7a5\uae30 \uc5f0\uad6c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc124\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 AI \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uace0\ub9bd\uc73c\ub85c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uc804\uccb4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc5d4\ub4dc \ud22c \uc5d4\ub4dc \ubcf4\uc548 \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e8\uc77c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc720\uc6a9\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc778\uc2dd\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub294 \uc885\uc885 \ubd88\ucda9\ubd84\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ube44\uc720\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \ud56d\uc0c1 \uc720\uc6a9\ud558\uace0 \ud574\uac00 \uc5c6\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ub9cc\ub4dc\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ud56d\uc0c1 \uc720\uc6a9\ud558\uace0 \ud574\uac00 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4\ub97c \ub9cc\ub4dc\ub294 \uac83\uacfc \uc720\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc218\uc2ed \ub144\uac04\uc758 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc5f0\uad6c \ubc0f \uc2e4\ubb34\uc758 \uc9d1\ud569\uc801 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc740 \uc774\uac83\uc774 \ubd88\ucda9\ubd84\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc624\ud788\ub824 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uae30 \uc804\uc5d0 \uc815\ubcf4\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \uacf5\uaca9\uc790 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uace0, \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \ubcf4\uc548\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5bb\uc740 \uad50\ud6c8\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uba70, \ubcf4\uc548 \ud0dc\uc138\uc758 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uac1c\uc120\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \ucef4\ud4e8\ud130 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548\uc744 \ud655\ubcf4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uac80\uc99d\ub41c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc8fc\uc694 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub294 AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0\uc11c \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc6d0\uce59\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud560 \ub54c \uc5f0\uad6c \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc9c0\uc810\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubcf4\uace0\uc11c\uc758 2\ucc28 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub294 AI\uc640 ML \uc2e4\ubb34\uc790 \ubc0f \uc5f0\uad6c\uc790\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc544\uc774\ub514\uc5b4\ub97c \uc815\uc81c\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305\uc5d0 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc6d0\uce59\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub530\ub978 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub17c\uc758\ud558\uace0, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\uc81c \uacf5\uaca9\uc758 11\uac1c \uc0ac\ub840 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ubcf4\uc548\uc5d0 \ud2b9\ud788 \ud574\ub2f9\ub418\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc5f0\uad6c \ubb38\uc81c\uc758 \uc77c\ub828\uc744 \uc815\uc758\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However, although they demonstrate strong P&R capabilities in English GUI scenarios, their performance in multilingual settings has received little attention, which limits their global applications. Moreover, existing studies on GUI tasks lack fine-grained analyses, including widget functions and elements' spatial relationships, which are fundamental for more targeted improvements. To tackle these issues, we propose MPR-GUI-Bench, a Multilingual fine-grained Perception and Reasoning GUI Benchmark to evaluate GUI agents' P&R capabilities. Evaluation results demonstrate that LVLMs exhibit significantly worse P&R performance in non-English languages than in English. To address these gaps, we propose GUI-XLI, a GUI Cross-Lingual Intervention method that applies interventions to the hidden states at P&R capability-related layers to mitigate the gaps between English and other languages, building on previous research showing that the hidden states of different language inputs exhibit significant differences in the latent space.

Existing theoretical studies in this area suffer from at least two of the following obstacles: memory inefficiency, the heavy dependence of sample complexity on the long horizon and the large state space, the high computational complexity, non-Markov policy, non-Nash policy, and high burn-in cost. In this work, we take a step towards settling this problem by designing a model-free self-play algorithm \\emph{Memory-Efficient Nash Q-Learning (ME-Nash-QL)} for two-player zero-sum Markov games, which is a specific setting of MARL. ME-Nash-QL is proven to enjoy the following merits. First, it can output an $\\varepsilon$-approximate Nash policy with space complexity $O(SABH)$ and sample complexity $\\widetilde{O}(H^4SAB/\\varepsilon^2)$, where $S$ is the number of states, $\\{A, B\\}$ is the number of actions for two players, and $H$ is the horizon length. It outperforms existing algorithms in terms of space complexity for tabular cases, and in terms of sample complexity for long horizons, i.e., when $\\min\\{A, B\\}\\ll H^2$. Second, ME-Nash-QL achieves the lowest computational complexity $O(T\\mathrm{poly}(AB))$ while preserving Markov policies, where $T$ is the number of samples. Third, ME-Nash-QL also achieves the best burn-in cost $O(SAB\\,\\mathrm{poly}(H))$, whereas previous algorithms have a burn-in cost of at least $O(S^3 AB\\,\\mathrm{poly}(H))$ to attain the same level of sample complexity with ours.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub450 \uc120\uc218\uc758 \uc601-zero-sum Markov \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ub0b4\uc2dc Q-\ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 ME-Nash-QL\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub824\uace0 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(MARL) \ubd84\uc57c\ub294 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc774 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ub0b4\ub9ac\ub294\uc9c0 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub4e4\uc740 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc131, \ub192\uc740 \uc0d8\ud50c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ub3c4 \uc758\uc874\uc131, \ub192\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ub3c4 \ub4f1 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub450 \uc120\uc218\uc758 \uc601-zero-sum Markov \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378 \uc790\uc720 Self-play \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc778 ME-Nash-QL\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc0d8\ud50c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ub3c4\uc758 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "ME-Nash-QL\uc740 Nash \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc57d $\text{O}(SABH)$\uc758 \uacf5\uac04 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ub3c4\uc640 $\tilde{\text{O}}(H^4SAB/\text{\u03b5}^2)$\uc758 \uc0d8\ud50c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ub3c4\ub85c \ucd9c\ub825\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uae30\uc874 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uacf5\uac04 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ub3c4\uc640 \uc0d8\ud50c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ub3c4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "ME-Nash-QL\uc740 \ub0ae\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ub3c4\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c Markov \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ubcf4\uc874\ud558\uba70, \uae30\uc874 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(MARL)\uc740 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc774 \uacf5\uc720\ud558\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ub0b4\ub9ac\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \ubd84\uc57c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubd84\uc57c\uc758 \uae30\uc874 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc131, \uae34 \uc218\uba85\uacfc \ud070 \uc0c1\ud0dc \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294 \uc0d8\ud50c \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131, \ub192\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131, \ube44-\ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uc815\ucc45, \ube44-\ub0b4\uc2dc \uc815\ucc45 \ubc0f \ub192\uc740 \ucd08\uae30 \ube44\uc6a9\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uc7a5\uc560\ubb3c\ub85c \uace0\ud1b5\ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub450 \uc120\uc218\uc758 \uc601-zero-sum Markov \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378 \uc790\uc720 \uc790\uae30 \ub180\uc774 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc778 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ub0b4\uc2dc Q-\ud559\uc2b5(ME-Nash-QL)\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uccab\uac78\uc74c\uc744 \ub0b4\ub51b\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Existing approaches overwhelmingly operate within the prompt-optimization paradigm: whether through traditional algorithmic search or recent agent-based workflows, the resulting prompts typically retain malicious semantic signals that modern guardrails are primed to detect. In contrast, we identify a deeper, largely overlooked vulnerability stemming from the highly interconnected nature of an LLM's internal knowledge. This structure allows harmful objectives to be realized by weaving together sequences of benign sub-queries, each of which individually evades detection. To exploit this loophole, we introduce the Correlated Knowledge Attack Agent (CKA-Agent), a dynamic framework that reframes jailbreaking as an adaptive, tree-structured exploration of the target model's knowledge base. The CKA-Agent issues locally innocuous queries, uses model responses to guide exploration across multiple paths, and ultimately assembles the aggregated information to achieve the original harmful objective. Evaluated across state-of-the-art commercial LLMs (Gemini2.5-Flash/Pro, GPT-oss-120B, Claude-Haiku-4.5), CKA-Agent consistently achieves over 95% success rates even against strong guardrails, underscoring the severity of this vulnerability and the urgent need for defenses against such knowledge-decomposition attacks.

We present Med-CMR, a fine-grained Medical Complex Multimodal Reasoning benchmark. Med-CMR distinguishes from existing counterparts by three core features: 1) Systematic capability decomposition, splitting medical multimodal reasoning into fine-grained visual understanding and multi-step reasoning to enable targeted evaluation; 2) Challenging task design, with visual understanding across three key dimensions (small-object detection, fine-detail discrimination, spatial understanding) and reasoning covering four clinically relevant scenarios (temporal prediction, causal reasoning, long-tail generalization, multi-source integration); 3) Broad, high-quality data coverage, comprising 20,653 Visual Question Answering (VQA) pairs spanning 11 organ systems and 12 imaging modalities, validated via a rigorous two-stage (human expert + model-assisted) review to ensure clinical authenticity. We evaluate 18 state-of-the-art MLLMs with Med-CMR, revealing GPT-5 as the top-performing commercial model: 57.81 accuracy on multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and a 48.70 open-ended score, outperforming Gemini 2.5 Pro (49.87 MCQ accuracy, 45.98 open-ended score) and leading open-source model Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B (49.34 MCQ accuracy, 42.62 open-ended score). However, specialized medical MLLMs do not reliably outperform strong general models, and long-tail generalization emerges as the dominant failure mode. Med-CMR thus provides a stress test for visual-reasoning integration and rare-case robustness in medical MLLMs, and a rigorous yardstick for future clinical systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Med-CMR\uc740 \uc758\ub8cc \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ucd94\ub860\uc758 \uc138\ubd80 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "MLLM\uc774 \uc784\uc0c1 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud750\ub984\uc5d0\uc11c \ub4f1\uc7a5\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc758\ub8cc \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc758\ub8cc \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc138\ubd84\ud654\ub41c \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \uc774\ud574\uc640 \ub2e4\ub2e8\uacc4 \ucd94\ub860\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ub204\uc5b4 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 20,653\uac1c\uc758 \ube44\uc8fc\uc5bc \uc9c8\ubb38 \uc751\ub2f5(VQA) \uc30d\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "18\uac1c\uc758 \ucd5c\uc2e0 MLLM\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, GPT-5\uac00 \ucd5c\uace0 \uc131\ub2a5 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c 57.81\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uae30\ub85d\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Med-CMR\uc740 \uc758\ub8cc MLLM\uc758 \ube44\uc8fc\uc5bc \ucd94\ub860 \ud1b5\ud569 \ubc0f \ub4dc\ubb38 \uc0ac\ub840\uc758 \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ud558\ub294 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "MLLMs\ub294 \uc784\uc0c1 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud750\ub984\uc5d0 \ub098\ud0c0\ub098\uae30 \uc2dc\uc791\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc758\ub8cc \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Med-CMR\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc138\ubd80\uc801\uc778 \uc758\ub8cc \ubcf5\ud569 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \ucd94\ub860 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.

We propose a model-based algorithm (\\textit{RTZ-VI-LCB}) for offline RTZMGs, which is optimistic robust value iteration combined with a data-driven Bernstein-style penalty term for robust value estimation. By accounting for distribution shifts in the historical dataset, the proposed algorithm establishes near-optimal sample complexity guarantees under partial coverage and environmental uncertainty. An information-theoretic lower bound is developed to confirm the tightness of our algorithm's sample complexity, which is optimal regarding both state and action spaces. To the best of our knowledge, RTZ-VI-LCB is the first to attain this optimality, sets a new benchmark for offline RTZMGs, and is validated experimentally.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 Robust Two-player Zero-sum Markov Games (RTZMGs)\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uc124\uc815\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8e8\uba70, \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 RTZ-VI-LCB\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc0d8\ud50c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ub3c4\ub97c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "MARL \ubd84\uc57c\uc758 \ud658\uacbd \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\uc751\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uac15\uc778\ud55c \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 RTZMGs\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 RTZ-VI-LCB\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uac15\uc778\ud55c \uac00\uce58 \ucd94\uc815\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ubc8c\uc810 \ud56d\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ub099\uad00\uc801\uc778 \uac15\uc778 \uac00\uce58 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \ubd80\ubd84 \ucee4\ubc84\ub9ac\uc9c0 \ubc0f \ud658\uacbd \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uadfc\uc811 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uc0d8\ud50c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ub3c4 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uc218\ub9bd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "RTZ-VI-LCB\ub294 \ucd5c\uc801\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc73c\ub85c, \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 RTZMGs\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \uc138\uc6b0\uace0 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\uc99d\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(MARL)\uc740 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uacf5\uc720 \ub3d9\uc801 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ub0b4\ub9ac\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \ubc1c\uc804 \ubd84\uc57c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud658\uacbd\uc758 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 MARL\uc758 \uc815\ucc45\uc740 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uacfc \ud604\uc2e4 \uac04\uc758 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uac15\uc778\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud574\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\uc778\ud55c \ub450 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\uc5b4 \uc81c\ub85c\uc12c \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uac8c\uc784(TZMG)\uc5d0 \uc911\uc810\uc744 \ub450\uba70, \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud45c \ud615\uc2dd\uc758 \uac15\uc778\ud55c TZMG(RTZMG)\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8f9\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 RTZMG\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc778 RTZ-VI-LCB\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uac15\uc778\ud55c \uac00\uce58 \ucd94\uc815\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ubc88\uc288\ud0c0\uc778 \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c \ubc8c\uc810 \ud56d\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ub099\uad00\uc801\uc778 \uac15\uc778 \uac00\uce58 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd84\ud3ec\uc758 \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \uace0\ub824\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368, \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \ubd80\ubd84 \ucee4\ubc84\ub9ac\uc9c0 \ubc0f \ud658\uacbd \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uac70\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uc0d8\ud50c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ub3c4 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uc218\ub9bd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc815\ubcf4 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ud558\ud55c\uc774 \uac1c\ubc1c\ub418\uc5b4 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \uc0d8\ud50c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ub3c4\uc758 \ud0c0\uc774\ud2b8\ud568\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc0c1\ud0dc \ubc0f \ud589\ub3d9 \uacf5\uac04 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ucd5c\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 RTZ-VI-LCB\uac00 \uc774 \ucd5c\uc801\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \uc0ac\ub840\ub85c, \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 RTZMG\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \uc124\uc815\ud558\uace0 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\uc99d\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

I propose a research program to investigate this idea in silico by studying how collective self-models (coherent, self-referential representations) emerge from distributed learning systems embedded within universal self-organizing environments. The theory outlined here starts from the supposition that consciousness is an emergent property of collective intelligence systems undergoing synchronization of prediction through communication. It is not an epiphenomenon of individual modeling but a property of the language that a system evolves to internally describe itself. For a model of base reality, I begin with a minimal but general computational world: a cellular automaton, which exhibits both computational irreducibility and local reducibility. On top of this computational substrate, I introduce a network of local, predictive, representational (neural) models capable of communication and adaptation. I use this layered model to study how collective intelligence gives rise to self-representation as a direct consequence of inter-agent alignment. I suggest that consciousness does not emerge from modeling per se, but from communication. It arises from the noisy, lossy exchange of predictive messages between groups of local observers describing persistent patterns in the underlying computational substrate (base reality). It is through this representational dialogue that a shared model arises, aligning many partial views of the world. The broader goal is to develop empirically testable theories of machine consciousness, by studying how internal self-models may form in distributed systems without centralized control.", "AI":

Conventional communication schemes often incur significant transmission overhead and latency, while existing trajectory prediction models generally lack environmental perception and logical inference capabilities. This paper presents a trajectory prediction framework that integrates semantic communication with Agentic AI to enhance predictive performance in vehicular environments. In vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, a feature-extraction agent at the Roadside Unit (RSU) derives compact representations from historical vehicle trajectories, followed by semantic reasoning performed by a semantic-analysis agent. The RSU then transmits both feature representations and semantic insights to the target vehicle via semantic communication, enabling the vehicle to predict future trajectories by combining received semantics with its own historical data. In vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, each vehicle performs local feature extraction and semantic analysis while receiving predicted trajectories from neighboring vehicles, and jointly utilizes this information for its own trajectory prediction. Extensive experiments across diverse communication conditions demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms baseline schemes, achieving up to a 47.5% improvement in prediction accuracy under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 V2X \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \uad50\ud658\uacfc \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uada4\uc801 \uc608\uce21 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ubc29\uc2dd\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "motivation": "V2X \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \uad50\ud658 \ubc0f \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uc788\ub294 \uc0c1\ud669 \uc778\uc2dd\uc774 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ucc28\ub7c9 \uac04 \uc778\ud504\ub77c(V2I) \ubc0f \ucc28\ub7c9 \uac04(V2V) \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc801 \ud1b5\uc2e0\uacfc \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \uada4\uc801 \uc608\uce21 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc870\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c4\ud589\ub41c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uae30\uc900 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ucd5c\ub300 47.5%\uc758 \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ub0ae\uc740 \uc2e0\ud638 \ub300 \uc7a1\uc74c \ube44\uc728(SNR) \uc870\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c \ud2b9\ud788 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \uad50\ud658\uacfc \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc740 \ucc28\ub7c9-\ubaa8\ub4e0 \uac83(V2X) \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc804\uc1a1 \ube44\uc6a9\uacfc \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud558\uba70, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uada4\uc801 \uc608\uce21 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud658\uacbd \uc778\uc2dd \ubc0f \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ucc28\ub7c9 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc608\uce21 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc801 \ud1b5\uc2e0\uacfc \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \uada4\uc801 \uc608\uce21 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \ucc28\ub7c9-\uc778\ud504\ub77c(V2I) \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc5d0\uc11c \ub3c4\ub85c\uce21 \uc7a5\uce58(RSU)\uc758 \ud2b9\uc9d5 \ucd94\ucd9c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uacfc\uac70 \ucc28\ub7c9 \uada4\uc801\uc5d0\uc11c \uc555\ucd95\ub41c \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ud30c\uc0dd\ud558\uace0, \uc774\uc5b4 \uc758\ubbf8 \ubd84\uc11d \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.

The framework advances AI by demonstrating how agentic LLMs can participate in autonomous scientific modeling and structured causal inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "ARCADIA\ub294 \uc6d0\uc778 \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ucd94\ub860\uacfc \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \uc9c4\ub2e8\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc720\ud6a8\ud558\uace0 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uc778\uacfc \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uace0 \uc2e4\uc81c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc774\uba70 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubaa8\ud615\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 ARCADIA\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "method": "ARCADIA\ub294 \uc81c\uc57d \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\uc640 \uc778\uacfc \uc720\ud6a8\uc131 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud6c4\ubcf4 DAG\ub97c \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\uc81c\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uae30\uc5c5 \ud30c\uc0b0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, ARCADIA\ub294 NOTEARS, GOLEM \ubc0f DirectLiNGAM\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc778\uacfc \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 LLM\uc774 \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \ubc0f \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc778\uacfc \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0 \ucc38\uc5ec\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec \uc8fc\uba70, AI\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \uc9c4\ub2e8\uacfc \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc720\ud6a8\ud558\uace0 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uc778\uacfc \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\ub294 \uc6d0\uc778 \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 AI \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 ARCADIA\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uacfc \ub2ec\ub9ac ARCADIA\ub294 \uc81c\uc57d \uae30\ubc18 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\uc640 \uc778\uacfc \uc720\ud6a8\uc131 \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud6c4\ubcf4 DAG\ub97c \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\uc81c\ud558\uc5ec \ud604\uc2e4 \uc138\uacc4\uc758 \uace0\uc704\ud5d8 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc5c5 \ud30c\uc0b0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c ARCADIA\ub294 NOTEARS, GOLEM \ubc0f DirectLiNGAM\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc778\uacfc \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uc644\uc804\ud558\uac8c \uc124\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uac1c\uc785 \uc900\ube44\uac00 \ub41c \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 LLM\uc774 \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \ubc0f \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc778\uacfc \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0 \ucc38\uc5ec\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec \uc90c\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 AI\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \uc774\ub04c\uc5b4 \ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

To address these gaps, we propose \\textit{SelfAI}, a general multi-agent platform that combines a User Agent for translating high-level research objectives into standardized experimental configurations, a Cognitive Agent powered by LLMs with optimal stopping criteria to iteratively refine hyperparameter searches, and an Experiment Manager responsible for orchestrating parallel, fault-tolerant training workflows across heterogeneous hardware while maintaining a structured knowledge base for continuous feedback. We further introduce two novel evaluation metrics, Score and $\\text{AUP}_D$, to quantify discovery efficiency and search diversity.

A representative example is remote microgrids that supply power to communities disconnected from the main grid. Enabling the energy transition in such systems requires coordinated control of renewable sources like wind turbines, alongside fuel generators and batteries, to meet demand while minimizing fuel consumption and battery degradation under exogenous and intermittent load and wind conditions. These systems must often conform to extensive regulations and complex operational constraints. To ensure that RL agents respect these constraints, it is crucial to provide interpretable guarantees. In this paper, we introduce Shielded Controller Units (SCUs), a systematic and interpretable approach that leverages prior knowledge of system dynamics to ensure constraint satisfaction. Our shield synthesis methodology, designed for real-world deployment, decomposes the environment into a hierarchical structure where each SCU explicitly manages a subset of constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SCUs on a remote microgrid optimization task with strict operational requirements. The RL agent, equipped with SCUs, achieves a 24% reduction in fuel consumption without increasing battery degradation, outperforming other baselines while satisfying all constraints.

Trdaitional QSAR models that utilizes molecular descriptor based data often struggles to predict bioactivity of molecules effectively due to its limitation in capturing structural and contextual information embedded within each compound. To address this challenge, we propose Rep3Net, a unified deep learning architecture that not only incorporates descriptor data but also includes spatial and relational information through graph-based represenation of compounds and contextual information through ChemBERTa generated embeddings from SMILES strings. Our model employing multimodal concatenated features produce reliable bioactivity prediction on Poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP-1) dataset. PARP-1 is a crucial agent in DNA damage repair and has become a significant theraputic target in malignancies that depend on it for survival and growth. A comprehensive analysis and comparison with conventional standalone models including GCN, GAT, XGBoost, etc. demonstrates that our architecture achieves the highest predictive performance.

However, when a task is under-specified, agents might fail to learn useful policies. In this work, we explore the possibility of improving coarse-grained logical specifications via an exploration-guided strategy. We propose \\textsc{AutoSpec}, a framework that searches for a logical specification refinement whose satisfaction implies satisfaction of the original specification, but which provides additional guidance therefore making it easier for reinforcement learning algorithms to learn useful policies. \\textsc{AutoSpec} is applicable to reinforcement learning tasks specified via the SpectRL specification logic. We exploit the compositional nature of specifications written in SpectRL, and design four refinement procedures that modify the abstract graph of the specification by either refining its existing edge specifications or by introducing new edge specifications.

We then show how \\textsc{AutoSpec} can be integrated with existing reinforcement learning algorithms for learning policies from logical specifications.

The burden falls disproportionately on marginalized populations and the Global South, where under-resourced health systems, exposure to urban heat islands, and the lack of adaptive infrastructure amplify risks. Yet current numerical weather prediction models often fail to capture micro-scale extremes, leaving the most vulnerable excluded from timely early warnings. We present a Graph Neural Network framework for localized, high-resolution temperature forecasting. By leveraging spatial learning and efficient computation, our approach generates forecasts at multiple horizons, up to 48 hours. For Southwestern Ontario, Canada, the model captures temperature patterns with a mean MAE of 1.93$^{\\circ}$C across 1-48h forecasts and MAE@48h of 2.93$^{\\circ}$C, evaluated using 24h input windows on the largest region.

Building agents that can survive and thrive in the real world (for example, by autonomously earning income or running a business) requires massive-scale interaction, reasoning, training, and evaluation across diverse embodied scenarios. However, existing world simulators for such development fall short: they often rely on limited hand-crafted environments, simulate simplified game-like physics and social rules, and lack native support for LLM/VLM agents. We introduce SimWorld, a new simulator built on Unreal Engine 5, designed for developing and evaluating LLM/VLM agents in rich, real-world-like settings. SimWorld offers three core capabilities: (1) realistic, open-ended world simulation, including accurate physical and social dynamics and language-driven procedural environment generation; (2) a rich interface for LLM/VLM agents, with multimodal world inputs and open-vocabulary actions at varying levels of abstraction; and (3) diverse and extensible physical and social reasoning scenarios that are easily customizable by users. We demonstrate SimWorld by deploying frontier LLM agents (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-Flash, Claude-3.5, and DeepSeek-Prover-V2) on long-horizon multi-agent delivery tasks involving strategic cooperation and competition. The results reveal distinct reasoning patterns and limitations across models.

Present affiliation: Iambic Therapeutics", "summary": "This work presents the development and evaluation of an NLP-enabled probabilistic classifier designed to estimate the probability of technical and regulatory success (pTRS) for clinical trials in the field of neuroscience. While pharmaceutical R&D is plagued by high attrition rates and enormous costs, particularly within neuroscience, where success rates are below 10%, timely identification of promising programs can streamline resource allocation and reduce financial risk. Leveraging data from the ClinicalTrials.gov database and success labels from the recently developed Clinical Trial Outcome dataset, the classifier extracts text-based clinical trial features using statistical NLP techniques. These features were integrated into several non-LLM frameworks (logistic regression, gradient boosting, and random forest) to generate calibrated probability scores. Model performance was assessed on a retrospective dataset of 101,145 completed clinical trials spanning 1976-2024, achieving an overall ROC-AUC of 0.64. An LLM-based predictive model was then built using BioBERT, a domain-specific language representation encoder. The BioBERT-based model achieved an overall ROC-AUC of 0.74 and a Brier Score of 0.185, indicating its predictions had, on average, 40% less squared error than would be observed using industry benchmarks.

The regret achieved by recent approaches is optimal, in the sense that it matches the lower bound. Yet, time complexity remains an issue for large matroids or for matroids with costly membership oracles (e.g. online recommendation that ensures diversity). This paper sheds a new light on the matroid semi-bandit problem by exploiting its underlying unimodal structure. We demonstrate that, with negligible loss in regret, the number of iterations involving the membership oracle can be limited to \\mathcal{O}(\\log \\log T)$. This results in an overall improved time complexity of the learning process. Experiments conducted on various matroid benchmarks show (i) no loss in regret compared to state-of-the-art approaches; and (ii) reduced time complexity and number of calls to the membership oracle.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub9e4\ud2b8\ub85c\uc774\ub4dc \uc81c\uc57d \ud558\uc758 \uc870\ud569\ub860\uc801 \ubc18\ubc34\ub527 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8ec\ub2e4. \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud68c\uc6d0 \uc624\ub77c\ud074\uc758 \ud638\ucd9c \ud69f\uc218\ub97c \uc904\uc774\uace0 \uc804\uccb4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uacfc\uc815\uc758 \uc2dc\uac04 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ucd5c\uadfc \uc811\uadfc\ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \ud6c4\ud68c\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub9e4\ud2b8\ub85c\uc774\ub4dc\ub098 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4dc\ub294 \ud68c\uc6d0 \uc624\ub77c\ud074\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0 \uc2dc\uac04 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \ub0a8\uc544\uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub9e4\ud2b8\ub85c\uc774\ub4dc \ubc18\ubc34\ub527 \ubb38\uc81c\uc758 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ub2e8\ubd09 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud68c\uc6d0 \uc624\ub77c\ud074\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \ubc18\ubcf5 \ud69f\uc218\ub97c \\\\mathcal{O}(\text{log log } T)\ub85c \uc81c\ud55c\ud558\ub294 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub9e4\ud2b8\ub85c\uc774\ub4dc \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud588\uc73c\uba70, \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uae30\ubc95\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec \ud6c4\ud68c\ub294 \ub3d9\uc77c\ud558\uace0, \uc2dc\uac04 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc774 \uac10\uc18c\ud558\uba70 \ud68c\uc6d0 \uc624\ub77c\ud074 \ud638\ucd9c \ud69f\uc218\uac00 \uc904\uc5b4\ub4e0 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub9e4\ud2b8\ub85c\uc774\ub4dc \ubc18\ubc34\ub527 \ubb38\uc81c\uc758 \uc2dc\uac04 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub9e4\ud2b8\ub85c\uc774\ub4dc \uc81c\uc57d \ud558\uc758 \uc870\ud569\ub860\uc801 \ubc18\ubc34\ub527 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ub2ec\uc131\ub41c \ud6c4\ud68c\ub294 \ud558\ud55c\uacfc \uc77c\uce58\ud558\ub294 \uc758\ubbf8\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub9e4\ud2b8\ub85c\uc774\ub4dc \ub610\ub294 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4dc\ub294 \uba64\ubc84\uc2ed \uc624\ub77c\ud074\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0(\uc608: \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ucd94\ucc9c) \uc2dc\uac04 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \ub41c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ub2e8\ubd09 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub9e4\ud2b8\ub85c\uc774\ub4dc \ubc18\ubc34\ub527 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uad00\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud6c4\ud68c\uc5d0\uc11c \ubbf8\ubbf8\ud55c \uc190\uc2e4\ub85c \uba64\ubc84\uc2ed \uc624\ub77c\ud074\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ub41c \ubc18\ubcf5 \ud69f\uc218\ub97c \\\\mathcal{O}(\text{log log } T)\ub85c \uc81c\ud55c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ud559\uc2b5 \uacfc\uc815\uc758 \uc804\uccb4\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\uac04 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ub0b3\ub294\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub9e4\ud2b8\ub85c\uc774\ub4dc \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc218\ud589\ub41c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc740 (i) \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud560 \ub54c \ud6c4\ud68c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc190\uc2e4\uc774 \uc5c6\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uace0; (ii) \uc2dc\uac04 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uacfc \uba64\ubc84\uc2ed \uc624\ub77c\ud074 \ud638\ucd9c \ud69f\uc218\uac00 \uc904\uc5b4\ub4e4\uc5c8\ub2e4."}}

As a result, current systems either mutate a small number of manually-crafted experiment examples, or operate solely from parametric knowledge, limiting quality and reach. We introduce CodeDistiller, a system that automatically distills large collections of scientific Github repositories into a vetted library of working domain-specific code examples, allowing ASD agents to expand their capabilities without manual effort. Using a combination of automatic and domain-expert evaluation on 250 materials science repositories, we find the best model is capable of producing functional examples for 74% of repositories, while our downstream evaluation shows an ASD agent augmented with a CodeDistiller generated library produces more accurate, complete, and scientifically sound experiments than an agent with only general materials-science code examples.", "AI": {"tldr": "CodeDistiller\ub294 \uacfc\ud559 GitHub \uc800\uc7a5\uc18c\ub97c \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\uc81c\ud558\uc5ec ASD \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uacfc\ud559 \ubc1c\uacac \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc218\ub3d9 \ub178\ub825 \uc5c6\uc774 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\ud654 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \ud655\uc7a5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub300\ub7c9\uc758 \uacfc\ud559 GitHub \uc800\uc7a5\uc18c\ub97c \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\uc81c\ud558\uc5ec \uac80\uc99d\ub41c \ub3d9\uc791 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\ud654 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc608\uc81c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 CodeDistiller \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "250\uac1c\uc758 \uc7ac\ub8cc \uacfc\ud559 \uc800\uc7a5\uc18c\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, \uac00\uc7a5 \uc88b\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 74%\uc758 \uc800\uc7a5\uc18c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uae30\ub2a5\uc801\uc778 \uc608\uc81c\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "CodeDistiller\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c \ub77c\uc774\ube0c\ub7ec\ub9ac\ub85c \ubcf4\uac15\ub41c ASD \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc77c\ubc18 \uc7ac\ub8cc \uacfc\ud559 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc608\uc81c\ub9cc \uac00\uc9c4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \uc815\ud655\ud558\uace0 \uc644\uc804\ud558\uba70 \uacfc\ud559\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud0c0\ub2f9\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uacfc\ud559 \ubc1c\uacac(ASD) \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ucf54\ub4dc \uae30\ubc18 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uc2e4\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc744 \uc904 \uc218 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub4e4\uc774 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uc788\uac8c \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ucf54\ub4dc\ub294 \ud30c\ub77c\uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc5d0\ub9cc \uc81c\ud55c\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacb0\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \ud604\uc7ac \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc18c\uc218\uc758 \uc218\uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uc791\ub41c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uc608\uc81c\ub97c \ubcc0\ud654\uc2dc\ud0a4\uac70\ub098 \ud30c\ub77c\uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad \uc9c0\uc2dd\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b4\uc601\ub418\uc5b4 \ud488\uc9c8\uacfc \ubc94\uc704\uac00 \uc81c\ud55c\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uacfc\ud559\uc801 GitHub \uc800\uc7a5\uc18c\ub97c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8\ub85c \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\uc81c\ud558\uc5ec \uc791\uc5c5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\ud654 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc608\uc81c\uc758 \uac80\uc99d\ub41c \ub77c\uc774\ube0c\ub7ec\ub9ac\ub85c \ub9cc\ub4dc\ub294 CodeDistiller\ub77c\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 ASD \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc218\ub3d9 \ub178\ub825 \uc5c6\uc774 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud655\uc7a5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. 250\uac1c\uc758 \uc7ac\ub8cc \uacfc\ud559 \uc800\uc7a5\uc18c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc790\ub3d9 \ubc0f \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \ud3c9\uac00\uc758 \uc870\ud569\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \uac00\uc7a5 \uc88b\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 74%\uc758 \uc800\uc7a5\uc18c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uae30\ub2a5\uc801\uc778 \uc608\uc81c\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud588\uc73c\uba70, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud558\uc704 \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 CodeDistiller\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \ub77c\uc774\ube0c\ub7ec\ub9ac\ub85c \ubcf4\uac15\ub41c ASD \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc77c\ubc18 \uc7ac\ub8cc \uacfc\ud559 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc608\uc81c\ub9cc \uac00\uc9c4 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \uc815\ud655\ud558\uace0 \uc644\uc804\ud558\uba70 \uacfc\ud559\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud0c0\ub2f9\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

These agents must orchestrate complex sequences of data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, and hyperparameter optimization, tasks that require sophisticated planning and iteration. While recent work on building ML agents has explored using large language models (LLMs) for direct code generation, tool-augmented approaches offer greater modularity and reliability. However, existing tool-use benchmarks focus primarily on task-specific tool selection or argument extraction for tool invocation, failing to evaluate the sophisticated planning capabilities required for ML Agents. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating tool-augmented ML agents using a curated set of 61 specialized tools and 15 tabular ML challenges from Kaggle. Our benchmark goes beyond traditional tool-use evaluation by incorporating an in-memory named object management, allowing agents to flexibly name, save, and retrieve intermediate results throughout the workflows. We demonstrate that standard ReAct-style approaches struggle to generate valid tool sequences for complex ML pipelines, and that tree search methods with LLM-based evaluation underperform due to inconsistent state scoring. To address these limitations, we propose two simple approaches: 1) using shaped deterministic rewards with structured textual feedback, and 2) decomposing the original problem into a sequence of sub-tasks, which significantly improves trajectory validity and task performance. Using GPT-4o, our approach improves over ReAct by 16.52 percentile positions, taking the median across all Kaggle challenges. We believe our work provides a foundation for developing more capable tool-augmented planning ML agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5

While reinforcement learning provides a principled mechanism for such agents to improve through interaction, its effectiveness critically depends on the availability of structured training tasks. In many realistic settings, however, no such tasks exist a challenge we term task scarcity, which has become a key bottleneck for scaling agentic RL. Existing approaches typically assume predefined task collections, an assumption that fails in novel environments where tool semantics and affordances are initially unknown. To address this limitation, we formalize the problem of Task Generation for Agentic RL, where an agent must learn within a given environment that lacks predefined tasks. We propose CuES, a Curiosity driven and Environment grounded Synthesis framework that autonomously generates diverse, executable, and meaningful tasks directly from the environment structure and affordances, without relying on handcrafted seeds or external corpora. CuES drives exploration through intrinsic curiosity, abstracts interaction patterns into reusable task schemas, and refines them through lightweight top down guidance and memory based quality control. Across three representative environments, AppWorld, BFCL, and WebShop, CuES produces task distributions that match or surpass manually curated datasets in both diversity and executability, yielding substantial downstream policy improvements. These results demonstrate that curiosity driven, environment grounded task generation provides a scalable foundation for agents that not only learn how to act, but also learn what to learn.

However, conventional reward models are prone to reward hacking or over-optimization, where the policy exploits shortcut patterns to obtain high reward scores that do not reflect true human preference. Although Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based reward models can enhance discriminative capability, they typically introduce substantial computational overhead. To address these challenges, we propose an upcycle and merge MoE reward modeling approach. We first upcycle a dense reward model into a MoE architecture, where a shared expert captures general knowledge, while normal experts specialize in instruction-specific patterns. We then apply routing-weight normalization and merge experts back into a dense model through a learnable weight-averaging mechanism, preserving performance gains while significantly reducing inference cost.

In this work, we extend NGU to multi-agent environments and evaluate its performance in the simple_tag environment from the PettingZoo suite. Compared to a multi-agent DQN baseline, NGU achieves moderately higher returns and more stable learning dynamics. We investigate three design choices: (1) shared replay buffer versus individual replay buffers, (2) sharing episodic novelty among agents using different k thresholds, and (3) using heterogeneous values of the beta parameter. Our results show that NGU with a shared replay buffer yields the best performance and stability, highlighting that the gains come from combining NGU intrinsic exploration with experience sharing. Novelty sharing performs comparably when k = 1 but degrades learning for larger values. Finally, heterogeneous beta values do not improve over a small common value. These findings suggest that NGU can be effectively applied in multi-agent settings when experiences are shared and intrinsic exploration signals are carefully tuned.", "AI": {"tldr": "NGU \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uace0, PettingZoo\uc758 simple_tag \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uacbd\ud5d8 \uacf5\uc720\uc640 \ub0b4\uc7ac\uc801 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uc2e0\ud638\uc758 \uc870\ud569\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud76c\uc18c\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc774 \uc8fc\uc5b4\uc9c0\ub294 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c NGU \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud658\uacbd\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud568.", "method": "NGU\ub97c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uace0, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc124\uacc4 \uc120\ud0dd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uadf8 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud568.", "result": "NGU\uac00 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 DQN \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \uc218\uc775\ub960\uacfc \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5 \ub3d9\uc801\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90c.", "conclusion": "NGU\uc640 \uacbd\ud5d8 \uacf5\uc720\uc758 \uc870\ud569\uc774 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud568.", "translated_summary": "Never Give Up (NGU) \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \uc5d0\ud53c\uc18c\ub4dc \ud2b9\uc774\uc131 \ubc0f \ub0b4\uc7ac\uc801 \ub3d9\uae30\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ud76c\uc18c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \uc785\uc99d\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 NGU\ub97c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud658\uacbd\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uace0 PettingZoo \uc2a4\uc704\ud2b8\uc758 simple_tag \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 DQN \uae30\uc900\uc120\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud560 \ub54c, NGU\ub294 \ub2e4\uc18c \ub192\uc740 \uc218\uc775\ub960\uacfc \ub354 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5 \ub3d9\uc801\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc124\uacc4 \uc120\ud0dd\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: (1) \uacf5\uc720 \ub9ac\ud50c\ub808\uc774 \ubc84\ud37c \ub300 \uac1c\uc778 \ub9ac\ud50c\ub808\uc774 \ubc84\ud37c, (2) \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 k \uc784\uacc4\uac12\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac04\uc758 \uc5d0\ud53c\uc18c\ub4dc \ud2b9\uc774\uc131 \uacf5\uc720, (3) \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ubca0\ud0c0 \uac12 \uc0ac\uc6a9. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uacf5\uc720 \ub9ac\ud50c\ub808\uc774 \ubc84\ud37c\uac00 \ucd5c\uc0c1\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, NGU\uc758 \ub0b4\uc7ac\uc801 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uacfc \uacbd\ud5d8 \uacf5\uc720\uc758 \uc870\ud569\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\uc775\uc774 \uc628\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Several source extraction programs, including SoFiA and Aegean, have been developed to address this challenge. However, finding optimal parameter configurations when applying these programs to real observations is non-trivial. For example, the outcomes of SoFiA intensely depend on several key parameters across its preconditioning, source-finding, and reliability-filtering modules. To address this issue, we propose a framework to automatically optimize these parameters using an AI agent based on a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm, i.e., Soft Actor-Critic (SAC). The SKA Science Data Challenge 2 (SDC2) dataset is utilized to assess the feasibility and reliability of this framework. The AI agent interacts with the environment by adjusting parameters based on the feedback from the SDC2 score defined by the SDC2 Team, progressively learning to select parameter sets that yield improved performance. After sufficient training, the AI agent can automatically identify an optimal parameter configuration that outperform the benchmark set by Team SoFiA within only 100 evaluation steps and with reduced time consumption.

However, their underlying reasoning \"algorithms\" remain poorly understood. To investigate this, we propose ReJump, which represents a reasoning trace as a visitation order over nodes in a tree of intermediate problem-solving steps. Transitions between nodes, which we term jumps, include adjacent moves that capture behaviors such as calculation, and non-adjacent moves that capture behaviors such as backtracking and verification. ReJump enables analyzing LLM reasoning with diverse metrics that quantify exploration, exploitation, overthinking, forgetting, and verification. Using our proposed LLM agent to extract reasoning traces into ReJump format, we evaluate state-of-the-art LRMs on two tasks and find that models with similar accuracy can exhibit distinct reasoning behaviors, while different tasks favor different reasoning styles (e.g., varying balance between exploration and exploitation). To further understand how learning strategies shape reasoning, we use ReJump to compare distilled LRMs with their teachers, CoT-prompted LLMs with LRMs, and to examine how the number of reasoning examples and reinforcement learning affect reasoning behavior. Finally, we show that ReJump can improve reasoning quality at test time through strategies such as ReJump-guided Best-of-N selection and prompt selection.

Standard analysis approaches do not usually exploit their dual event / state nature: signals are either modeled as transition event sequences, emphasizing event order alignment, or as categorical or ordinal state timeseries, usually resampled a distorting and costly operation as the observation period and number of events grow. In this work we define state transition event timeseries (STE-ts) and propose a new Selective Temporal Hamming distance (STH) leveraging both transition time and duration-in-state, avoiding costly and distorting resampling on large databases. STH generalizes both resampled Hamming and Jaccard metrics with better precision and computation time, and an ability to focus on multiple states of interest.

Classic parameter-averaging methods such as FedAvg transmit full model weights and can diverge under nonindependent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. We propose KTA v2, a prediction-space knowledge trading market for FL. Each round, clients locally train on their private data, then share only logits on a small public reference set. The server constructs a client-client similarity graph in prediction space, combines it with reference-set accuracy to form per-client teacher ensembles, and sends back personalized soft targets for a second-stage distillation update. This two-stage procedure can be interpreted as approximate block-coordinate descent on a unified objective with prediction-space regularization. Experiments on FEMNIST, CIFAR-10 and AG News show that, under comparable or much lower communication budgets, KTA v2 consistently outperforms a local-only baseline and strong parameter-based methods (FedAvg, FedProx), and substantially improves over a FedMD-style global teacher. On CIFAR-10 with ResNet-18, KTA v2 reaches 57.7% test accuracy using approximately 1/1100 of FedAvg's communication, while on AG News it attains 89.3% accuracy with approximately 1/300 of FedAvg's traffic.", "AI": {"tldr": "KTA v2\ub294 \ubd84\uc0b0 \uba40\ud2f0\ubbf8\ub514\uc5b4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uac1c\uc120\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c, \ube44\ub3c5\ub9bd \ubc0f \ub3d9\ub4f1\ud558\uac8c \ubd84\ud3ec\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uba70 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ube44\ub3c5\ub9bd \ub3d9\ub4f1 \ubd84\ud3ec \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc800\ud558\uc640 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc81c\uc57d \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "KTA v2\ub294 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\uac00 \uac1c\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ub85c\uceec \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uace0, \uc791\uc740 \uacf5\uc6a9 \ucc38\uc870 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub85c\uc9d3\ub9cc \uacf5\uc720\ud558\uc5ec \uc720\uc0ac\uc131 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\ub294 \ub450 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc758 \uc808\ucc28\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "KTA v2\ub294 FEMNIST, CIFAR-10, AG News\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc800\ube44\uc6a9 \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc608\uc0b0 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud558\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "KTA v2\ub294 \ube44\ub3c5\ub9bd \ub3d9\ub4f1 \ubd84\ud3ec \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5(FL)\uc740 \ubd84\uc0b0\ub41c \uba40\ud2f0\ubbf8\ub514\uc5b4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \ud611\uc5c5 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud2b9\ud788 \ud074\ub77c\uc774\uc5b8\ud2b8\uac00 \ub300\ud615 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ubc30\ud3ec\ud560 \uacbd\uc6b0 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131\uacfc \ud1b5\uc2e0 \uc81c\uc57d\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ud070 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

In this work, we propose a novel approach that leverages combinations of pre-trained (language, policy) pairs to establish an efficient transfer pipeline. Our algorithm is inspired by the principles of Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) in Computer Vision, which aligns representations across different modalities under the philosophy that ''two modalities representing the same concept should have similar representations.'' The central idea here is that the instruction and corresponding policy of a task represent the same concept, the task itself, in two different modalities. Therefore, by extending the idea of CLIP to RL, our method creates a unified representation space for natural language and policy embeddings.

Existing deep traffic models are typically trained per city and backbone, creating high maintenance cost and poor transfer to data-scarce cities. We ask whether a single, backbone-agnostic layer can condition on \"which city this sequence comes from\", improve accuracy in full- and low-data regimes, and support better cross-city adaptation with minimal code changes.\n  We propose CityCond, a light-weight city-conditioned memory layer that augments existing spatio-temporal backbones. CityCond combines a city-ID encoder with an optional shared memory bank (CityMem). Given a city index and backbone hidden states, it produces city-conditioned features fused through gated residual connections. We attach CityCond to five representative backbones (GRU, TCN, Transformer, GNN, STGCN) and evaluate three regimes: full-data, low-data, and cross-city few-shot transfer on METR-LA and PEMS-BAY. We also run auxiliary experiments on SIND, a drone-based multi-agent trajectory dataset from a signalized intersection in Tianjin (we focus on pedestrian tracks).\n  Across more than fourteen model variants and three random seeds, CityCond yields consistent improvements, with the largest gains for high-capacity backbones such as Transformers and STGCNs. CityMem reduces Transformer error by roughly one third in full-data settings and brings substantial gains in low-data and cross-city transfer. On SIND, simple city-ID conditioning modestly improves low-data LSTM performance.

Code and simulation notebooks available at the GitHub repository: https://github.com/Saba-Kublashvili/bayesian-computational-modeling.-", "summary": "Modeling historical events poses fundamental challenges for machine learning: extreme data scarcity (N << 100), heterogeneous and noisy measurements, missing counterfactuals, and the requirement for human interpretable explanations. We present HistoricalML, a probabilistic neuro-symbolic framework that addresses these challenges through principled integration of (1) Bayesian uncertainty quantification to separate epistemic from aleatoric uncertainty, (2) structural causal models for counterfactual reasoning under confounding, (3) cooperative game theory (Shapley values) for fair allocation modeling, and (4) attention based neural architectures for context dependent factor weighting. We provide theoretical analysis showing that our approach achieves consistent estimation in the sparse data regime when strong priors from domain knowledge are available, and that Shapley based allocation satisfies axiomatic fairness guarantees that pure regression approaches cannot provide. We instantiate the framework on two historical case studies: the 19th century partition of Africa (N = 7 colonial powers) and the Second Punic War (N = 2 factions). Our model identifies Germany's +107.9 percent discrepancy as a quantifiable structural tension preceding World War I, with tension factor 36.43 and 0.79 naval arms race correlation. For the Punic Wars, Monte Carlo battle simulations achieve a 57.3 percent win probability for Carthage at Cannae and 57.8 percent for Rome at Zama, aligning with historical outcomes. Counterfactual analysis reveals that Carthaginian political support (support score 6.4 vs Napoleon's 7.1), rather than military capability, was the decisive factor.", "AI": {"tldr":

By leveraging Haar wavelet transforms to enhance expressive capacity through frequency decomposition, HBLLM significantly improves quantization fidelity while maintaining minimal overhead. This approach features two innovative structure-aware grouping strategies: (1) frequency-aware multi-parameter intra-row grouping and (2) $\\ell_2$-norm-based saliency-driven column selection. For non-salient weights, a shared mean is employed across quantization groups within each frequency band to optimize storage efficiency. Experiments conducted on the OPT and LLaMA models demonstrate that HBLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance in $1$-bit quantization, attaining a perplexity of $6.71$ on LLaMA$2$-$13$B with an average weight storage of only $1.08$ bits.

While human evaluation is reliable, it is slow and costly. Single LLM judges are biased, and static juries lack adaptability. To overcome these limitations, we propose LLM Jury-on-Demand - a dynamic, learning-based framework for scalable and context-aware evaluation. Our method trains a set of reliability predictors to assess when LLM judges will agree with human experts, leveraging token distributions, embeddings, and structural input features. This enables a fully adaptive evaluation where, for each data point, an optimal jury of the most reliable judges is dynamically selected, and their scores are aggregated using their reliability as weights. Experiments on summarization and RAG benchmarks show that our dynamic jury system achieves significantly higher correlation with human judgment than both single-judge and static-jury baselines. These results highlight the promise of adaptive, learning-based juries for building scalable, more reliable and trustworthy evaluation systems for modern LLMs in high-stakes domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM Jury-on-Demand\ub294 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uc608\uce21\uae30\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec LLM\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ub428\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \ubc30\ud3ec\uc640 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uc788\ub294 \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uc608\uce21\uae30\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828\uc2dc\ucf1c LLM \ud310\uc0ac\uac00 \uc778\uac04 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc640 \uc77c\uce58\ud560 \ub54c\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ub3d9\uc801 \ubc30\uc2ec \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ub2e8\uc77c \ud310\uc0ac \ubc0f \uc815\uc801 \ubc30\uc2ec \uae30\uc900\uc120\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc778\uac04 \ud310\ub2e8\uacfc \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc801\uc751\ud615 \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc30\uc2ec\uc740 \ud604\ub300 LLM\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uc788\ub294 \ud3c9\uac00 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uad6c\ucd95\uc758 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ub428\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \ubc30\ud3ec\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \ucee4\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc778\uac04 \ud3c9\uac00\uac00 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc \ub290\ub9ac\uace0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4e0\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc5d0\uc11c, \ub2e8\uc77c LLM \ud310\uc0ac\ub294 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc774 \uc788\uc73c\uba70 \uc815\uc801 \ubc30\uc2ec\uc740 \uc801\uc751\uc131\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc81c\ud55c\uc744 \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc778\uc2dd \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ub3d9\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc18 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 LLM Jury-on-Demand\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uc608\uce21\uae30 \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\uc2dc\ucf1c LLM \ud310\uc0ac\uac00 \uc778\uac04 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc640 \uc77c\uce58\ud560 \ub54c\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0, \ud1a0\ud070 \ubd84\ud3ec, \uc784\ubca0\ub529 \ubc0f \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \uc785\ub825 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uac01 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uac00\uc7a5 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud310\uc0ac\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \ubc30\uc2ec\uc744 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\uace0, \uadf8\ub4e4\uc758 \uc810\uc218\ub97c \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc9d1\uacc4\ud558\ub294 \uc644\uc804\ud55c \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc694\uc57d \ubc0f RAG \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ub3d9\uc801 \ubc30\uc2ec \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ub2e8\uc77c \ud310\uc0ac \ubc0f \uc815\uc801 \ubc30\uc2ec \uae30\uc900\uc120\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc778\uac04 \ud310\ub2e8\uacfc \uc720\uc758\ubbf8\ud558\uac8c \ub192\uc740 \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ub192\uc740 \uc704\ud5d8\uc774 \uc218\ubc18\ub418\ub294 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud604\ub300 LLM\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uace0 \ub354 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud3c9\uac00 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uad6c\ucd95\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ud559\uc2b5 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc30\uc2ec\uc758 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

Remarkably, they preserve knowledge of once-learned environments sans catastrophic forgetting, a phenomenon neuroscientists hypothesize, is due to a singular neural circuitry dynamically overlayed by neuromodulatory agents such as dopamine and acetylcholine. In parallel, deep learning research addresses analogous challenges via domain generalization (DG) and continual learning (CL), yet these methods remain siloed, despite the brains ability to perform them seamlessly. In particular, prior work has not explored architectures involving associative memories (AMs), which are an integral part of biological systems, to jointly address these tasks. We propose Memory-Integrated Reconfigurable Adapters (MIRA), a unified framework that integrates Hopfield-style associative memory modules atop a shared backbone. Associative memory keys are learned post-hoc to index and retrieve an affine combination of stored adapter updates for any given task or domain on a per-sample basis. By varying only the task-specific objectives, we demonstrate that MIRA seamlessly accommodates domain shifts and sequential task exposures under one roof. Empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks confirm that our AM-augmented architecture significantly enhances adaptability and retention: in DG, MIRA achieves SoTA out-of-distribution accuracy, and in incremental learning settings, it outperforms architectures explicitly designed to handle catastrophic forgetting using generic CL algorithms. By unifying adapter-based modulation with biologically inspired associative memory, MIRA delivers rapid task switching and enduring knowledge retention in a single extensible architecture, charting a

Entities that are close in graph distance will have lower surprise than those farther apart. This connects the Free Energy Principle (FEP) from neuroscience to KG systems, where the KG serves as the agent's generative model. We formalize surprise using the shortest-path distance in directed graphs and provide a framework for KG-based agents. Graph distance appears in graph neural networks as message passing depth and in model-based reinforcement learning as world model trajectories.

Designing such reward functions can be challenging and may not generalize well across different tasks. To address this limitation, we leverage the rich world knowledge contained in pretrained video diffusion models to provide goal-driven reward signals for RL agents without ad-hoc design of reward. Our key idea is to exploit off-the-shelf video diffusion models pretrained on large-scale video datasets as informative reward functions in terms of video-level and frame-level goals. For video-level rewards, we first finetune a pretrained video diffusion model on domain-specific datasets and then employ its video encoder to evaluate the alignment between the latent representations of agent's trajectories and the generated goal videos. To enable more fine-grained goal-achievement, we derive a frame-level goal by identifying the most relevant frame from the generated video using CLIP, which serves as the goal state. We then employ a learned forward-backward representation that represents the probability of visiting the goal state from a given state-action pair as frame-level reward, promoting more coherent and goal-driven trajectories. Experiments on various Meta-World tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ube44\ub514\uc624 \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL) \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubaa9\ud45c \uae30\ubc18 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\ud654\ub41c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218 \uc124\uacc4\uc758 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574", "method": "\ube44\ub514\uc624 \uc218\uc900 \ubc0f \ud504\ub808\uc784 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ube44\ub514\uc624 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\ub85c \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ube44\ub514\uc624 \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9", "result": "Meta-World\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud568", "conclusion": "\uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc124\uacc4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uad04\ubaa9\ud560 \ub9cc\ud55c \uc131\uacf5\uc744 \uac70\ub450\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uc548\ub0b4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc138\uc2ec\ud558\uac8c \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \uc124\uacc4\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b8 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc798 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc81c\ud55c\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ube44\ub514\uc624 \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud3ec\ud568\ub41c \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \uc138\uacc4 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc124\uacc4 \uc5c6\uc774 RL \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ubaa9\ud45c \uae30\ubc18 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec \uc544\uc774\ub514\uc5b4\ub294 \ube44\ub514\uc624 \uc218\uc900 \ubc0f \ud504\ub808\uc784 \uc218\uc900 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4\uc131 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218\ub85c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ube44\ub514\uc624 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uae30\uc131 \ube44\ub514\uc624 \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ube44\ub514\uc624 \uc218\uc900 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uba3c\uc800 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\ud654 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ube44\ub514\uc624 \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\ud55c \ud6c4, \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \ubaa9\ud45c \ube44\ub514\uc624\uc640 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uacbd\ub85c\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \ud45c\ud604 \uac04\uc758 \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ube44\ub514\uc624 \uc778\ucf54\ub354\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc138\ubc00\ud55c \ubaa9\ud45c \ub2ec\uc131\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 CLIP\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \ube44\ub514\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uac00\uc7a5 \uad00\ub828\uc131 \ub192\uc740 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uc5ec \ud504\ub808\uc784 \uc218\uc900 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uba70, \uc774\uac83\uc774 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub85c \uc791\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7f0 \ub2e4\uc74c \uc8fc\uc5b4\uc9c4 \uc0c1\ud0dc-\ud589\ub3d9 \uc30d\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa9\ud45c \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \ubc29\ubb38\ud560 \ud655\ub960\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\ub294 \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \uc804\ubc29-\ud6c4\ubc29 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud504\ub808\uc784 \uc218\uc900 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \uc0bc\uc544 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uace0 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc9c0\ud5a5\uc801\uc778 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \ucd09\uc9c4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c Meta-World \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc740 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

We rank over 50 open and closed source models by playing against a random opponent using a range of behavioral metrics, including win and loss rates, move quality, move legality, hallucinated actions, and game duration. For a subset of top reasoning models, we derive an Elo estimate by playing against a chess engine with variably configured skill, which allows for comparisons between models in an easily understandable way. Despite the simplicity of the instruction-following task and the weakness of the opponent, many state-of-the-art models struggle to complete games or achieve consistent wins. Similar to other benchmarks on complex reasoning tasks, our experiments reveal a clear separation between reasoning and non-reasoning models. However, unlike existing static benchmarks, the stochastic and dynamic nature of LLM CHESS uniquely reduces overfitting and memorization while preventing benchmark saturation, proving difficult even for top reasoning models.

Moser"], "title": "Operator-Theoretic Framework for Gradient-Free Federated Learning", "comment": null, "summary": "Federated learning must address heterogeneity, strict communication and computation limits, and privacy while ensuring performance. We propose an operator-theoretic framework that maps the $L^2$-optimal solution into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) via a forward operator, approximates it using available data, and maps back with the inverse operator, yielding a gradient-free scheme. Finite-sample bounds are derived using concentration inequalities over operator norms, and the framework identifies a data-dependent hypothesis space with guarantees on risk, error, robustness, and approximation. Within this space we design efficient kernel machines leveraging the space folding property of Kernel Affine Hull Machines. Clients transfer knowledge via a scalar space folding measure, reducing communication and enabling a simple differentially private protocol: summaries are computed from noise-perturbed data matrices in one step, avoiding per-round clipping and privacy accounting. The induced global rule requires only integer minimum and equality-comparison operations per test point, making it compatible with fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). Across four benchmarks, the gradient-free FL method with fixed encoder embeddings matches or outperforms strong gradient-based fine-tuning, with gains up to 23.7 points. In differentially private experiments, kernel smoothing mitigates accuracy loss in high-privacy regimes. The global rule admits an FHE realization using $Q \\times C$ encrypted minimum and $C$ equality-comparison operations per test point, with operation-level benchmarks showing practical latencies. Overall, the framework provides provable guarantees with low communication, supports private knowledge transfer via scalar summaries, and yields an FHE-compatible prediction rule offering a mathematically grounded alternative to gradient-based federated learning under heterogeneity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131\uc744

Raisbeck", "Bruno Castro da Silva"], "title": "AltNet: Addressing the Plasticity-Stability Dilemma in Reinforcement Learning", "comment": null, "summary": "Neural networks have shown remarkable success in supervised learning when trained on a single task using a fixed dataset. However, when neural networks are trained on a reinforcement learning task, their ability to continue learning from new experiences declines over time. This decline in learning ability is known as plasticity loss. To restore plasticity, prior work has explored periodically resetting the parameters of the learning network, a strategy that often improves overall performance. However, such resets come at the cost of a temporary drop in performance, which can be dangerous in real-world settings. To overcome this instability, we introduce AltNet, a reset-based approach that restores plasticity without performance degradation by leveraging twin networks. The use of twin networks anchors performance during resets through a mechanism that allows networks to periodically alternate roles: one network learns as it acts in the environment, while the other learns off-policy from the active network's interactions and a replay buffer. At fixed intervals, the active network is reset and the passive network, having learned from prior experiences, becomes the new active network. AltNet restores plasticity, improving sample efficiency and achieving higher performance, while avoiding performance drops that pose risks in safety-critical settings.

While robust training can reduce sensitivity to some forms of noise, it is infeasible to anticipate all possible OOD conditions. To mitigate this issue, we develop an algorithm that leverages a world model's inherent measure of surprise to reduce the impact of noise in world model--based reinforcement learning agents. We introduce both multi-representation and single-representation rejection sampling, enabling robustness to settings with multiple faulty sensors or a single faulty sensor. While the introduction of noise typically degrades agent performance, we show that our techniques preserve performance relative to baselines under varying types and levels of noise across multiple environments within self-driving simulation domains (CARLA and Safety Gymnasium). Furthermore, we demonstrate that our methods enhance the stability of two state-of-the-art world models with markedly different underlying architectures: Cosmos and DreamerV3. Together, these results highlight the robustness of our approach across world modeling domains.

A model-free Q-learning algorithm was implemented to dynamically adjust the brightness of a Light-Emitting Diode (LED) based on real-time feedback from a light-dependent resistor (LDR) sensor. The system was trained to stabilize at 13 distinct light intensity levels (L1 to L13), with each target corresponding to a specific range within the 64-state space derived from LDR readings. A total of 130 trials were conducted, covering all target levels with 10 episodes each. Performance was evaluated in terms of convergence speed, steps taken, and time required to reach target states. Box plots and histograms were generated to analyze the distribution of training time and learning efficiency across targets. Experimental validation demonstrated that the agent could effectively learn to stabilize at varying light levels with minimal overshooting and smooth convergence, even in the presence of environmental perturbations.

However, the high cost of measurement acquisition and the substantial distributional shifts in temperature field across varying conditions present significant challenges for developing reconstruction models with robust generalization capabilities. Existing DNNs-based methods typically formulate TFR-HSS as a one-to-one regression problem based solely on target sparse measurements, without effectively leveraging reference simulation data that implicitly encode thermal knowledge. To address this limitation, we propose IPTR, an implicit physics-guided temperature field reconstruction framework that introduces sparse monitoring-temperature field pair from reference simulations as priors to enrich physical understanding. To integrate both reference and target information, we design a dual physics embedding module consisting of two complementary branches: an implicit physics-guided branch employing cross-attention to distill latent physics from the reference data, and an auxiliary encoding branch based on Fourier layers to capture the spatial characteristics of the target observation. The fused representation is then decoded to reconstruct the full temperature field. Extensive experiments under single-condition, multi-condition, and few-shot settings demonstrate that IPTR consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy and strong generalization capability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc628\ub3c4 \ud544\ub4dc \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c IPTR

However, inferring these factors from neural activity remains a significant challenge. To build general-purpose representations that allow for resolving information about a neuron's identity, we introduce NuCLR, a self-supervised framework that aims to learn representations of neural activity that allow for differentiating one neuron from the rest. NuCLR brings together views of the same neuron observed at different times and across different stimuli and uses a contrastive objective to pull these representations together. To capture population context without assuming any fixed neuron ordering, we build a spatiotemporal transformer that integrates activity in a permutation-equivariant manner. Across multiple electrophysiology and calcium imaging datasets, a linear decoding evaluation on top of NuCLR representations achieves a new state-of-the-art for both cell type and brain region decoding tasks, and demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization to unseen animals. We present the first systematic scaling analysis for neuron-level representation learning, showing that increasing the number of animals used during pretraining consistently improves downstream performance. The learned representations are also label-efficient, requiring only a small fraction of labeled samples to achieve competitive performance. These results highlight how large, diverse neural datasets enable models to recover information about neuron identity that generalize across animals.

However, exact posterior inference is computationally intractable, and widely used approximations like the Laplace method struggle with scalability and posterior accuracy in modern deep networks. In this work, we revisit sampling techniques for posterior exploration, proposing a simple variation tailored to efficiently sample from the posterior in over-parameterized networks by leveraging the low-dimensional structure of loss minima.

Current systems increasingly operate in rapidly evolving environments that generate diverse yet interconnected data modalities -- such as time series, system logs, and tabular records -- as exemplified by modern IT systems. Effective AD methods in such environments must therefore possess two critical capabilities: (1) the ability to handle heterogeneous data formats within a unified framework, allowing the model to process and detect multiple modalities in a consistent manner during anomalous events; (2) a strong generalization ability to quickly adapt to new scenarios without extensive retraining. However, most existing methods fall short of these requirements, as they typically focus on single modalities and lack the flexibility to generalize across domains. To address this gap, we introduce a novel paradigm: In-Context Anomaly Detection (ICAD), where anomalies are defined by their dissimilarity to a relevant reference set of normal samples. Under this paradigm, we propose ICAD-LLM, a unified AD framework leveraging Large Language Models' in-context learning abilities to process heterogeneous data within a single model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ICAD-LLM achieves competitive performance with task-specific AD methods and exhibits strong generalization to previously unseen tasks, which substantially reduces deployment costs and enables rapid adaptation to new environments. To the best of our knowledge, ICAD-LLM is the first model capable of handling anomaly detection tasks across diverse domains and modalities.", "AI": {"tldr": "ICAD-LLM\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud615\uc2dd\uc744 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uba70 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \uc2e0\uc18d\ud558\uac8c \uc801\uc751\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud601\uc2e0\uc801\uc778 \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ube60\ub974\uac8c \ubcc0\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud615\uc2dd\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "ICAD-LLM\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc778\ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud559\uc2b5 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ub2e8\uc77c \ubaa8\ub378 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569 \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "ICAD-LLM\uc740 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucd98 \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uacfc \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70, \uc774\uc804\uc5d0 \ubcf4\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\ub3c4 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubc1c\ud718\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "ICAD-LLM\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uacfc \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\ub97c \uc544\uc6b0\ub974\ub294 \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0(AD)\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uae30\ubcf8 \uc791\uc5c5\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud604\uc7ac \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ud604\ub300 IT \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc608\uc640 \uac19\uc774 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4, \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ub85c\uadf8, \ud45c \ud615\ud0dc\uc758 \uae30\ub85d \ub4f1 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ube60\ub974\uac8c \uc9c4\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b4\uc601\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 AD \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac16\ucd94\uc5b4\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: (1) \uc774\uc0c1 \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8 \uc911\uc5d0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\ub97c \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uace0 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud1b5\ud569\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud615\uc2dd\uc744 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825;

We suggest that not only agents but also specialized software modules for scientific and engineering tasks can be generated on demand. We demonstrate this concept in the field of solid mechanics. There, so-called constitutive models are required to describe the relationship between mechanical stress and body deformation. Constitutive models are essential for both the scientific understanding and industrial application of materials. However, even recent data-driven methods of constitutive modeling, such as constitutive artificial neural networks (CANNs), still require substantial expert knowledge and human labor. We present a framework in which an LLM generates a CANN on demand, tailored to a given material class and dataset provided by the user. The framework covers LLM-based architecture selection, integration of physical constraints, and complete code generation. Evaluation on three benchmark problems demonstrates that LLM-generated CANNs achieve accuracy comparable to or greater than manually engineered counterparts, while also exhibiting reliable generalization to unseen loading scenarios and extrapolation to large deformations. These findings indicate that LLM-based generation of physics-constrained neural networks can substantially reduce the expertise required for constitutive modeling and represent a step toward practical

A Case Study on Countdown", "comment": null, "summary": "While reinforcement learning (RL) successfully enhances reasoning in large language models, its role in fostering compositional generalization (the ability to synthesize novel skills from known components) is often conflated with mere length generalization. To this end, we study what RL post-training teaches about skill composition and how the structure of the composition affects the skill transfer. We focus on the Countdown task (given n numbers and a target, form an expression that evaluates to the target) and analyze model solutions as expression trees, where each subtree corresponds to a reusable subtask and thus can be viewed as a ``skill.'' Tracking tree shapes and their success rates over training, we find: (i) out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization to larger n and to unseen tree shapes, indicating compositional reuse of subtasks; (ii) a structure-dependent hierarchy of learnability -- models master shallow balanced trees (workload is balanced between subtasks) before deep unbalanced ones, with persistent fragility on right-heavy structures (even when the composition depth is the same as some left-heavy structures). Our diagnostic reveals what is learned, in what order, and where generalization fails, clarifying how RL-only post-training induces OOD generalization beyond what standard metrics such as pass@k reveal.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba70, \uad6c\uc131 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654(compositional generalization) \uc5ed\ud560\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uad6c\uc131 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\uc640 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \uae38\uc774 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\uc758 \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud558\uba70, RL\uc774 \uae30\uc220 \uad6c\uc131\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uce74\uc6b4\ud2b8\ub2e4\uc6b4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud45c\ud604 \ud2b8\ub9ac\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0, \ud6c8\ub828 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ud2b8\ub9ac \ubaa8\uc591\uacfc \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \ucd94\uc801\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "OOD \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uace0, \ud559\uc2b5 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \uad6c\uc870 \uc758\uc874\uc801\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 RL \uae30\ubc18 \ud6c4\ucc98\ub9ac\uac00 OOD \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uba85\ud655\ud788 \ud558\uace0, \uc131\uacfc\uc758 \uc21c\uc11c\uc640 \uc2e4\ud328 \uc9c0\uc810\uc744 \uc9c4\ub2e8\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uadf8 \uad6c\uc131 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654(\uc54c\ub824\uc9c4 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uae30\uc220\uc744 \ud569\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825) \ucd09\uc9c4 \uc5ed\ud560\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \uae38\uc774 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\uc640 \ud63c\ub3d9\ub41c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 RL \ud6c4\ud6c8\ub828\uc774 \uae30\uc220 \uc870\ud569\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ubb34\uc5c7\uc744 \uac00\ub974\uce58\ub294\uc9c0, \uc870\ud569\uc758 \uad6c\uc870\uac00 \uae30\uc220 \uc804\uc774\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub5a4 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294\uc9c0 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uce74\uc6b4\ud2b8\ub2e4\uc6b4 \uc791\uc5c5(\uc8fc\uc5b4\uc9c4 n\uac1c\uc758 \uc22b\uc790\uc640 \ubaa9\ud45c, \ubaa9\ud45c\uc5d0 \ud3c9\uac00\ub418\ub294 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ud615\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uac83)\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uace0, \ubaa8\ub378 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \ud45c\ud604 \ud2b8\ub9ac\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uba70, \uc5ec\uae30\uc11c \uac01 \uc11c\ube0c\ud2b8\ub9ac\ub294 \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc11c\ube0c \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ud574\ub2f9\ud558\ubbc0\ub85c '\uae30\uc220'\ub85c \uac04\uc8fc\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \ud6c8\ub828 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud2b8\ub9ac \ubaa8\uc591\uacfc \uc131\uacf5\ub960\uc744 \ucd94\uc801\ud558\uba70 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 (i) \ub354 \ud070 n \ubc0f \ubcf4\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ud2b8\ub9ac \ud615\ud0dc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubd84\ud3ec \uc678 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654(OOD)\ub97c \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uc5ec \uc11c\ube0c \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \uad6c\uc131 \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b8\ub2e4; (ii) \ud559\uc2b5 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc758 \uad6c\uc870 \uc758\uc874\uacc4\uce35\uc774 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\uc5ec, \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uae4a\uc774\uac00 \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \uc77c\ubd80 \uc67c\ucabd \ud3b8\ud5a5 \uad6c\uc870\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc624\ub978\ucabd \ud3b8\ud5a5 \uad6c\uc870\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ubd88\uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba70 \uc595\uc740 \uade0\ud615 \uc7a1\ud78c \ud2b8\ub9ac\ub97c \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud130\ud55c \ub4a4 \uae4a\uc740 \ubd88\uade0\ud615 \ud2b8\ub9ac\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc9c4\ub2e8\uc740 \ubb34\uc5c7\uc774 \uc54c\ub824\uc9c0\uace0, \uc5b4\ub5a4 \uc21c\uc11c\ub85c \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc9c0\uba70, \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\uac00 \uc2e4\ud328\ud558\ub294 \uc9c0\uc810\uc744 \ubc1d\ud600\ub0b4 RL\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c \ud6c4\ud6c8\ub828\uc774 \ud45c\uc900 \uce21\uc815\uce58\uc778 pass@k\uac00 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b4\ub294 \uac83 \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 OOD \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub97c \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uba85\ud655\ud788 \ud55c\ub2e4."}}

Active learning is a well-established framework in machine learning in which the learner selectively queries labels, often achieving substantially higher accuracy and efficiency than classical supervised methods-especially in settings where labeling is costly or time-consuming, such as hiring, admissions, and loan decisions. Strategic classification, however, addresses scenarios where agents modify their features to obtain more favorable outcomes, resulting in observed data that is not truthful. Such manipulation introduces challenges beyond those in learning from clean data. Our goal is to design active and noise-tolerant algorithms that remain effective in strategic environments-algorithms that classify strategic agents accurately while issuing as few label requests as possible. The central difficulty is to simultaneously account for strategic manipulation and preserve the efficiency gains of active learning.\n  Our main result is an algorithm for actively learning linear separators in the strategic setting that preserves the exponential improvement in label complexity over passive learning previously obtained only in the non-strategic case. Specifically, for data drawn uniformly from the unit sphere, we show that a modified version of the Active Perceptron algorithm [DKM05,YZ17] achieves excess error $\u03b5$ using only $\\tilde{O}(d \\ln \\frac{1}\u03b5)$ label queries and incurs at most $\\tilde{O}(d \\ln \\frac{1}\u03b5)$ additional mistakes relative to the optimal classifier, even in the nonrealizable case, when a $\\tilde\u03a9(\u03b5)$ fraction of inputs have inconsistent labels with the optimal classifier. The algorithm is computationally efficient and, under these distributional assumptions, requires substantially fewer label queries than prior work on strategic Perceptron [ABBN21].", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ubd84\ub958\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub2a5\ub3d9 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc2dc\uc791\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \ubd84\ub958\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ub354\uc6b1 \uc720\ub9ac\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc5bb\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \uc218\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "\uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc120\ud615 \ubd84\ub9ac\uae30\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \ubb34\uc791\uc704\ub85c \ub2e8\uc704 \uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd94\ucd9c\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc694\uad6c\ub41c \ub808\uc774\ube14 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ub3c4\ub97c \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uba70, \uae30\uc874 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 Perceptron \uc5f0\uad6c\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud6e8\uc52c \uc801\uc740 \ub808\uc774\ube14 \uc9c8\uc758\ub97c \uc694\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ubd84\ub958\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub2a5\ub3d9 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc2dc\uc791\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2a5\ub3d9 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \ud559\uc2b5\uc790\uac00 \uc120\ubcc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub808\uc774\ube14\uc744 \uc9c8\uc758\ud558\uc5ec \uace0\uc804\uc801\uc778 \uac10\ub3c5 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \ub192\uc740 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc640 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc798 \uc815\ub9bd\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \ubd84\ub958\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc720\ub9ac\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc5bb\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \uc218\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uba70, \uc774\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uad00\ucc30\ub418\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub294 \uc9c4\uc2e4\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc870\uc791\uc740 \uae68\ub057\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ud559\uc2b5\ud560 \ub54c\uc640\ub294 \ub2e4\ub978 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub294 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ub178\uc774\uc988\uc5d0 \uac15\ud55c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc911\uc559\uc758 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc740 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \uc870\uc791\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ub2a5\ub3d9 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc120\ud615 \ubd84\ub9ac\uae30\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc73c\ub85c, \ube44\uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \uc0ac\ub840\uc5d0\uc11c\ub9cc \uc5bb\uc740 \ub808\uc774\ube14 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ub3c4\uc758 \uae30\ud558\uae09\uc218\uc801\uc778 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788, \ub2e8\uc704 \uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c \ubb34\uc791\uc704\ub85c \ucd94\ucd9c\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574, Active Perceptron \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \uc218\uc815\ub41c \ubc84\uc804\uc774 \uacfc\uc789 \uc624\ub958 $\u03b5$\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e8\uc9c0 $\tilde{O}(d \tn \frac{1}\u03b5)$ \ub808\uc774\ube14 \uc9c8\uc758\ub97c \uc694\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \ucd5c\uc801 \ubd84\ub958\uae30\uc640 \uad00\ub828\ud558\uc5ec \ucd5c\ub300 $\tilde{O}(d \tn \frac{1}\u03b5)$\uc758 \ucd94\uac00 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \ubc1c\uc0dd\uc2dc\ud0b4\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uba70 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubd84\ud3ec\uc801 \uac00\uc815 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 Perceptron \uc5f0\uad6c\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud6e8\uc52c \uc801\uc740 \ub808\uc774\ube14 \uc9c8\uc758\ub97c \uc694\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

While instructions serve as the primary protocol for defining agents, RLVR typically relies on static and manually designed instructions. However, those instructions may be suboptimal for the base model, and the optimal instruction may change as the agent's policy improves and explores the interaction with the environment. To bridge the gap, we introduce INSPO, a novel Instruction-Policy co-evolution framework that integrates instruction optimization as a dynamic component of the reinforcement learning (RL) loop. INSPO maintains a dynamic population of instruction candidates that are sampled with questions, where reward signals in RL loops are automatically attributed to each instruction, and low performers are periodically pruned. New instructions are generated and verified through an on-policy reflection mechanism, where an LLM-based optimizer analyzes past experience from a replay buffer and evolves more effective strategies given the current policy. We conduct extensive experiments on multi-turn retrieval and reasoning tasks, demonstrating that INSPO substantially outperforms strong baselines relying on static instructions. INSPO discovers innovative instructions that guide the agent toward more strategic reasoning paths, achieving substantial performance gains with only a marginal increase in computational overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "INSPO\ub294 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ub8e8\ud504\uc758 \ub3d9\uc801 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub85c\uc11c \uc9c0\uce68 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \ud658\uacbd\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\uba70 \uc9c0\uce68\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc815\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc218\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc9c0\uce68\uc740 \uae30\ubcf8 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ucd5c\uc801\uc774 \uc544\ub2d0 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc815\ucc45\uc774 \uac1c\uc120\ub428\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uc9c0\uce68\uc774 \ubcc0\uacbd\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "INSPO\ub294 \uc9c0\uce68 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ub8e8\ud504\uc758 \ub3d9\uc801 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\ub85c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 Instruction-Policy \uacf5\uc9c4\ud654 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\ub41c \uc9c0\uce68 \ud6c4\ubcf4\uc758 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba70, RL \ub8e8\ud504\uc758 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uac01 \uc9c0\uce68\uc5d0 \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uadc0\uc18d\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "INSPO\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud134 \uac80\uc0c9 \ubc0f \ucd94\ub860 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc815\uc801 \uc9c0\uce68\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ub2a5\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "INSPO\ub294 \uc9c0\uce68\uc744 \ud601\uc2e0\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ub354 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801\uc778 \ucd94\ub860 \uacbd\ub85c\ub85c \uc774\ub04c\uba70, \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c \uc57d\uac04 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uac83\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c\ub3c4 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac80\uc99d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RLVR)\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf1c, \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ub2e4\uc911 \ud134 \ubc0f \ub3c4\uad6c \ud1b5\ud569 \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc790\uc728\uc801 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc9c0\uce68\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc815\uc758\ud558\ub294 \uc8fc\uc694 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, RLVR\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc218\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc9c0\uce68\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc9c0\uce68\uc740 \uae30\ubcf8 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ucd5c\uc801\uc774 \uc544\ub2d0 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc815\ucc45\uc774 \uac1c\uc120\ub418\uba74\uc11c \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uc9c0\uce68\uc774 \ubcc0\uacbd\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 INSPO\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc9c0\uce68-\uc815\ucc45 \uacf5\ub3d9 \uc9c4\ud654 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, existing offline RL methods often assume stationarity or only consider synthetic perturbations at test time, assumptions that often fail in real-world scenarios characterized by abrupt, time-varying offsets. These offsets can lead to partial observability, causing agents to misperceive their true state and degrade performance. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Forecasting in Non-stationary Offline RL (FORL), a framework that unifies (i) conditional diffusion-based candidate state generation, trained without presupposing any specific pattern of future non-stationarity, and (ii) zero-shot time-series foundation models. FORL targets environments prone to unexpected, potentially non-Markovian offsets, requiring robust agent performance from the onset of each episode. Empirical evaluations on offline RL benchmarks, augmented with real-world time-series data to simulate realistic non-stationarity, demonstrate that FORL consistently improves performance compared to competitive baselines. By integrating zero-shot forecasting with the agent's experience, we aim to bridge the gap between offline RL and the complexities of real-world, non-stationary environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ube44\uc815\uc0c1 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 FORL \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c \uc18c\uac1c", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\ub2a5 \uc800\ud558\ub97c \uacaa\ub294\ub2e4.", "method": "FORL\uc740 \uc870\uac74\ubd80 \ud655\uc0b0 \uae30\ubc18 \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc0dd\uc131\uacfc \uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "result": "FORL\uc740 \uae30\uc874 \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uac1c\uc120\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "FORL\uc740 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uacfc \ube44\uc815\uc0c1 \ud658\uacbd \uac04\uc758 \uac04\uadf9\uc744 \uba54\uc6b0\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc740 \ucd94\uac00 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc218\uc9d1\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ubd88\uac00\ub2a5\ud560 \ub54c \ubbf8\ub9ac \uc218\uc9d1\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 RL \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uc815\uc801\uc131\uc744 \uac00\uc815\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc5d0 \ud569\uc131 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\ub9cc\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud558\uc5ec, \uac11\uc791\uc2a4\ub7fd\uace0 \uc2dc\uac04 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \uc624\ud504\uc14b\uc774 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc778 \ud604\uc2e4 \uc138\uacc4\uc758 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\ud328\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc624\ud504\uc14b\uc740 \ubd80\ubd84 \uad00\uce21 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc838, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \uc9c4\uc815\ud55c \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \uc798\ubabb \uc778\uc2dd\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uace0 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc800\ud558\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 RL\uc5d0\uc11c \uc608\uce21(FORL)\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 (i) \ubbf8\ub798\uc758 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1 \ud328\ud134\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud2b9\uc815\ud55c \uac00\uc815\uc744 \ub450\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uc870\uac74\ubd80 \ud655\uc0b0 \uae30\ubc18 \ud6c4\ubcf4 \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uace0, (ii) \uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.
