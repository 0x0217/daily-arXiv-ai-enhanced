This motivates principled designs\nin which the system itself includes built-in mechanisms to guard against such\nattacks. We propose a novel approach to limit the degree to which harmful\ndemonstrations can degrade model performance. First, we define a baseline\n``safe'' behavior for the model -- the model's performance given no in-context\ndemonstrations (zero-shot). Next, we apply distribution-free risk control\n(DFRC) to control the extent to which in-context samples can decay performance\nbelow zero-shot. We achieve this by leveraging dynamic early exit prediction,\nignoring later attention heads that attend the most to the unsafe inputs.\nFinally, we propose modifications to DFRC that allow it to both control risk\nfor harmful inputs \\textit{and} leverage performance and efficiency gains on\nhelpful inputs.

We\nprove that the SFT objective is a special case of Inverse Q-Learning, which\nimplies that the SFT process does not just learn a policy, but also an\nimplicit, dense, token-level reward model that explains the expert\ndemonstrations. We then show how to recover this dense reward signal directly\nfrom the SFT model by formulating a baseline-relative reward function. The\navailability of such a dense reward model offers numerous benefits, providing\ngranular credit assignment for each token generated. We demonstrate one key\napplication by using these recovered rewards to further improve the policy with\nreinforcement learning. Our method, Dense-Path REINFORCE, consistently\noutperforms the original SFT models on instruction-following benchmarks. This\nwork reframes SFT not merely as policy imitation but as a powerful reward\nlearning mechanism, opening new possibilities for leveraging expert\ndemonstrations."}

Under Review", "summary": "Although recent tool-augmented benchmarks incorporate complex user requests\nand diverse tools, the evaluation methods for most of them remain limited to\nanswer matching. However, as the number of steps required to resolve a user\nrequest increases, a proper evaluation of an agent's performance must go beyond\nthe final answer to also assess the problem-solving trajectory, including\npreviously ignored aspects such as efficiency, hallucination, and adaptivity.\nThe most straightforward method for evaluating these aspects is to compare an\nagent's trajectory with the ground-truth trajectory, but this approach is\nfundamentally limited since annotating all valid ground-truth trajectories is\nprohibitively expensive. However, a simple LLM-based evaluator struggles to\nassess trajectories in detail without ground truth. To effectively evaluate the\nagents in this manner, we introduce TRACE, a framework for the\nmulti-dimensional evaluation of tool-augmented LLM agent performance. By\nincorporating an evidence bank, which accumulates knowledge gathered from\npreceding reasoning steps, TRACE enables a multi-faceted analysis and\nevaluation of an agent's reasoning trajectory effectively. To validate our\nframework, we develop a new meta-evaluation dataset by augmenting existing\nbenchmarks with diverse and flawed trajectories, each labeled with\nmulti-faceted performance scores. Our results confirm that TRACE accurately\nevaluates these complex behaviors in a scalable and cost-effective manner, even\nwith small open-source LLMs. Furthermore, we apply our method to evaluate the\ntrajectories that agents produce while solving tool-augmented tasks, presenting\npreviously unreported observations and their corresponding insights."}

We attribute the\ncontradiction between the theoretical expressiveness and empirical performance\nto their practical trainability: while continuous diffusion provides\nintermediate supervision that looped transformers lack, they introduce\nadditional difficulty decoding tokens into the discrete token space from the\ncontinuous representation space.

Recent advances in\ncomputational neuroscience have shown that learning in standard gradient\ndescent optimization formulation is not consistent with learning in biological\nsystems. This has opened up interesting avenues for building biologically\ninspired learning techniques. One such approach is inspired by Dale's law,\nwhich states that inhibitory and excitatory synapses do not swap roles during\nthe course of learning. The resulting exponential gradient descent optimization\nscheme leads to log-normally distributed synaptic weights. Interestingly, the\ndensity that satisfies the Fokker-Planck equation corresponding to the\nstochastic differential equation (SDE) with geometric Brownian motion (GBM) is\nthe log-normal density. Leveraging this connection, we start with the SDE\ngoverning geometric Brownian motion, and show that discretizing the\ncorresponding reverse-time SDE yields a multiplicative update rule, which\nsurprisingly, coincides with the sampling equivalent of the exponential\ngradient descent update founded on Dale's law. Furthermore, we propose a new\nformalism for multiplicative denoising score-matching, subsuming the loss\nfunction proposed by Hyvaerinen for non-negative data. Indeed, log-normally\ndistributed data is positive and the proposed score-matching formalism turns\nout to be a natural fit.

This vulnerability is characterized by two core\naspects: First, the malicious effect of injected records is only activated\nwithin a specific context, making them hard to detect when individual memory\nentries are audited in isolation.

This work shifts LLM memory security from\nstatic filtering to a proactive, experience-driven model where defenses\nstrengthen over time.

However, most CAGC methods utilize edges as auxiliary\ninformation to obtain node-level embedding representation and only focus on\nnode-level embedding augmentation. This approach overlooks edge-level embedding\naugmentation and the interactions between node-level and edge-level embedding\naugmentations across various granularity. Moreover, they often treat all\ncontrastive sample pairs equally, neglecting the significant differences\nbetween hard and easy positive-negative sample pairs, which ultimately limits\ntheir discriminative capability. To tackle these issues, a novel robust\nattributed graph clustering (RAGC), incorporating hybrid-collaborative\naugmentation (HCA) and contrastive sample adaptive-differential awareness\n(CSADA), is proposed. First, node-level and edge-level embedding\nrepresentations and augmentations are simultaneously executed to establish a\nmore comprehensive similarity measurement criterion for subsequent contrastive\nlearning. In turn, the discriminative similarity further consciously guides\nedge augmentation. Second, by leveraging pseudo-label information with high\nconfidence, a CSADA strategy is elaborately designed, which adaptively\nidentifies all contrastive sample pairs and differentially treats them by an\ninnovative weight modulation function. The HCA and CSADA modules mutually\nreinforce each other in a beneficent cycle, thereby enhancing discriminability\nin representation learning. Comprehensive graph clustering evaluations over six\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RAGC against\nseveral state-of-the-art CAGC methods."}

Surprisingly, our studies find that evading contamination\ndetections for LRMs is alarmingly easy. We focus on the two scenarios where\ncontamination may occur in practice: (I) when the base model evolves into LRM\nvia SFT and RL, we find that contamination during SFT can be originally\nidentified by contamination detection methods. Yet, even a brief GRPO training\ncan markedly conceal contamination signals that most detection methods rely on.\nFurther empirical experiments and theoretical analysis indicate that PPO style\nimportance sampling and clipping objectives are the root cause of this\ndetection concealment, indicating that a broad class of RL methods may\ninherently exhibit similar concealment capability; (II) when SFT contamination\nwith CoT is applied to advanced LRMs as the final stage, most contamination\ndetection methods perform near random guesses.

While on-device finetuning captures personalized user preference, it\nimposes additional computational burden through local retraining. To address\nthese challenges, we propose a framework for \\underline{\\textbf{C}}ustomizing\n\\underline{\\textbf{H}}ybrid-precision \\underline{\\textbf{O}}n-device model for\nsequential \\underline{\\textbf{R}}ecommendation with\n\\underline{\\textbf{D}}evice-cloud collaboration (\\textbf{CHORD}), leveraging\nchannel-wise mixed-precision quantization to simultaneously achieve\npersonalization and resource-adaptive deployment. CHORD distributes randomly\ninitialized models across heterogeneous devices and identifies user-specific\ncritical parameters through auxiliary hypernetwork modules on the cloud. Our\nparameter sensitivity analysis operates across multiple granularities (layer,\nfilter, and element levels), enabling precise mapping from user profiles to\nquantization strategy. Through on-device mixed-precision quantization, CHORD\ndelivers dynamic model adaptation and accelerated inference without\nbackpropagation, eliminating costly retraining cycles. We minimize\ncommunication overhead by encoding quantization strategies using only 2 bits\nper channel instead of 32-bit weights. Experiments on three real-world datasets\nwith two popular backbones (SASRec and Caser) demonstrate the accuracy,\nefficiency, and adaptivity of CHORD."}

For difficult\ntasks, this single-shot selection often underperforms. Consequently,\nevaluations commonly report Pass@$k$: the agent may submit up to $k$ responses,\nand only the best of them is used when computing regret. Motivated by this, we\nstudy inference scaling in the more general Pass@$k$ inference setting, and\nprove that neither majority voting nor BoN exhibits the desirable scaling with\n$k$ and the sampling budget $N$. Combining the advantages of majority voting\nand BoN, we propose a new inference strategy called Best-of-Majority (BoM),\nwith a pivotal step that restricts the candidates to the responses with high\nfrequency in the $N$ samples before selecting the top-$k$ rewards. We prove\nthat when the sampling budget is $N=\\tilde\\Omega(C^*)$, the regret of BoM is\n$O(\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{opt}}+\\sqrt{\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{RM}}^2C^*/k})$, where $C^*$\nis the coverage coefficient, $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{RM}}$ is the estimation error\nof the reward model, and $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{opt}}$ is the estimation error of\nreward at the optimal response. We further establish a matching lower bound,\ncertifying that our algorithm is minimax optimal. Beyond optimality, BoM has a\nkey advantage: unlike majority voting and BoN, its performance does not degrade\nwhen increasing $N$. Experimental results of inference on math problems show\nBoM outperforming both majority voting and BoN."}

However, limited\nattention has been given to the close-enough TSP (CETSP), primarily due to the\nchallenge introduced by its neighborhood-based visitation criterion, wherein a\nnode is considered visited if the agent enters a compact neighborhood around\nit. In this work, we formulate a Markov decision process (MDP) for CETSP using\na discretization scheme and propose a novel unified dual-decoder DRL (UD3RL)\nframework that separates decision-making into node selection and waypoint\ndetermination. Specifically, an adapted encoder is employed for effective\nfeature extraction, followed by a node-decoder and a loc-decoder to handle the\ntwo sub-tasks, respectively. A k-nearest neighbors subgraph interaction\nstrategy is further introduced to enhance spatial reasoning during location\ndecoding. Furthermore, we customize the REINFORCE algorithm to train UD3RL as a\nunified model capable of generalizing across different problem sizes and\nvarying neighborhood radius types (i.e., constant and random radii).\nExperimental results show that UD3RL outperforms conventional methods in both\nsolution quality and runtime, while exhibiting strong generalization across\nproblem scales, spatial distributions, and radius ranges, as well as robustness\nto dynamic environments."}

A shortcut\nto achieving higher rankings is to incorporate evaluation benchmarks into the\ntraining data, thereby yielding inflated performance, known as benchmark\ncontamination. Surprisingly, our studies find that evading contamination\ndetections for LRMs is alarmingly easy. We focus on the two scenarios where\ncontamination may occur in practice: (I) when the base model evolves into LRM\nvia SFT and RL, we find that contamination during SFT can be originally\nidentified by contamination detection methods. Yet, even a brief GRPO training\ncan markedly conceal contamination signals that most detection methods rely on.\nFurther empirical experiments and theoretical analysis indicate that PPO style\nimportance sampling and clipping objectives are the root cause of this\ndetection concealment, indicating that a broad class of RL methods may\ninherently exhibit similar concealment capability; (II) when SFT contamination\nwith CoT is applied to advanced LRMs as the final stage, most contamination\ndetection methods perform near random guesses. Without exposure to non-members,\ncontaminated LRMs would still have more confidence when responding to those\nunseen samples that share similar distributions to the training set, and thus,\nevade existing memorization-based detection methods. Together, our findings\nreveal the unique vulnerability of LRMs evaluations: Model developers could\neasily contaminate LRMs to achieve inflated leaderboards performance while\nleaving minimal traces of contamination, thereby strongly undermining the\nfairness of evaluation and threatening the integrity of public leaderboards.\nThis underscores the urgent need for advanced contamination detection methods\nand trustworthy evaluation protocols tailored to LRMs."}

However, this flexibility introduces\nsafety concerns: LLMs can be influenced by incorrect or malicious\ndemonstrations -- for example, if an adversary tampers with or injects harmful\nexamples without a human supervisor noticing. This motivates principled designs\nin which the system itself includes built-in mechanisms to guard against such\nattacks. We propose a novel approach to limit the degree to which harmful\ndemonstrations can degrade model performance. First, we define a baseline\n``safe'' behavior for the model -- the model's performance given no in-context\ndemonstrations (zero-shot). Next, we apply distribution-free risk control\n(DFRC) to control the extent to which in-context samples can decay performance\nbelow zero-shot. We achieve this by leveraging dynamic early exit prediction,\nignoring later attention heads that attend the most to the unsafe inputs.\nFinally, we propose modifications to DFRC that allow it to both control risk\nfor harmful inputs \\textit{and} leverage performance and efficiency gains on\nhelpful inputs. We present both theoretical and empirical results showing that\nour approach can effectively control risk for harmful in-context demonstrations\nwhile simultaneously achieving substantial computational efficiency gains with\nhelpful demonstrations."}

Existing red-teaming efforts are either restricted to\na narrow set of adversarial patterns or depend heavily on manual engineering,\nlacking scalable exploration of emerging real-world VLM vulnerabilities. To\nbridge this gap, we propose ARMs, an adaptive red-teaming agent that\nsystematically conducts comprehensive risk assessments for VLMs. Given a target\nharmful behavior or risk definition, ARMs automatically optimizes diverse\nred-teaming strategies with reasoning-enhanced multi-step orchestration, to\neffectively elicit harmful outputs from target VLMs. We propose 11 novel\nmultimodal attack strategies, covering diverse adversarial patterns of VLMs\n(e.g., reasoning hijacking, contextual cloaking), and integrate 17 red-teaming\nalgorithms into ARMs via model context protocol (MCP). To balance the diversity\nand effectiveness of the attack, we design a layered memory with an\nepsilon-greedy attack exploration algorithm. Extensive experiments on instance-\nand policy-based benchmarks show that ARMs achieves SOTA attack success rates,\nexceeding baselines by an average of 52.1% and surpassing 90% on\nClaude-4-Sonnet.

Safety fine-tuning with ARMs-Bench substantially improves the robustness\nof VLMs while preserving their general utility, providing actionable guidance\nto improve multimodal safety alignment against emerging threats."}
