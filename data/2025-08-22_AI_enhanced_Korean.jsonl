Yet, traditional localization methods often lack\ncryptographic guarantees of where and when an entity was present, leaving them\nvulnerable to spoofing, replay, or collusion attacks. In response, research on\nProof-of-Location (PoL) has emerged, with recent approaches combining distance\nbounding, distributed consensus, and privacy-enhancing techniques to enable\nverifiable, tamper-resistant location claims.\n  As the design space for PoL systems grows in complexity, this paper provides\na unified framework to help practitioners navigate diverse application needs.\nWe first propose a taxonomy identifying four core domains: (1) cryptographic\nguarantees, (2) spatio-temporal synchronization, (3) trust and witness models,\nand (4) interaction and overhead.

Predicting students at risk\nof dropout allows for timely interventions. While traditional Machine Learning\n(ML) models operating on tabular data have shown promise, Graph Neural Networks\n(GNNs) offer a potential advantage by capturing complex relationships inherent\nin student data if structured as graphs. This paper investigates whether\ntransforming tabular student data into graph structures, primarily using\nclustering techniques, enhances dropout prediction accuracy. We compare the\nperformance of GNNs (a custom Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and GraphSAGE)\non these generated graphs against established tabular models (Random Forest\n(RF), XGBoost, and TabNet) using a real-world student dataset. Our experiments\nexplore various graph construction strategies based on different clustering\nalgorithms (K-Means, HDBSCAN) and dimensionality reduction techniques\n(Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Uniform Manifold Approximation and\nProjection (UMAP)). Our findings demonstrate that a specific GNN configuration,\nGraphSAGE on a graph derived from PCA-KMeans clustering, achieved superior\nperformance, notably improving the macro F1-score by approximately 7 percentage\npoints and accuracy by nearly 2 percentage points over the strongest tabular\nbaseline (XGBoost). However, other GNN configurations and graph construction\nmethods did not consistently surpass tabular models, emphasizing the critical\nrole of the graph generation strategy and GNN architecture selection. This\nhighlights both the potential of GNNs and the challenges in optimally\ntransforming tabular data for graph-based learning in this domain.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud559\uc0dd

Discussions of whether or how to integrate\nlarge language models (LLMs) into everyday life (e.g., acting as proxies for,\nor interacting with, human agents), should be informed by an understanding of\nhow these tools evaluate emotionally loaded stimuli or situations. A model's\nalignment with human behavior in these cases can inform the effectiveness of\nLLMs for certain roles or interactions. To help build this understanding, we\nelicited ratings from multiple popular LLMs for datasets of words and images\nthat were previously rated for their emotional content by humans. We found that\nwhen performing the same rating tasks, GPT-4o responded very similarly to human\nparticipants across modalities, stimuli and most rating scales (r = 0.9 or\nhigher in many cases). However, arousal ratings were less well aligned between\nhuman and LLM raters, while happiness ratings were most highly aligned. Overall\nLLMs aligned better within a five-category (happiness, anger, sadness, fear,\ndisgust) emotion framework than within a two-dimensional (arousal and valence)\norganization. Finally, LLM ratings were substantially more homogenous than\nhuman ratings. Together these results begin to describe how LLM agents\ninterpret emotional stimuli and highlight similarities and differences among\nbiological and artificial intelligence in key behavioral domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc774 \uac10\uc815\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd80\ud558\uac00 \uac78\ub9b0 \uc790\uadf9\uc774\ub098 \uc0c1\ud669\uc744 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc774\ud574\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c LLM\uc758 \uc778\uac04 \ud589\ub3d9 \uc815\ud569\uc131\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc77c\uc0c1 \uc0dd\ud65c\uc5d0\uc11c LLM\uc744 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ud1b5\ud569\ud560\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub17c\uc758\ub294 \uac10\uc815 \uc790\uadf9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c LLM\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud574\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc778\uac04\uc774 \uac10\uc815 \ucf58\ud150\uce20\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c \ub2e8\uc5b4\uc640 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc778\uae30 LLM\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c elicited\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "GPT-4o\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ucd9c\ucc98\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uac04 \ucc38\uac00\uc790\uc640 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc720\uc0ac\ud558\uac8c \ubc18\uc751\ud588\uc73c\uba70, \ud589\ubcf5\ub3c4_rating\uc740 \uac00\uc7a5 \ub192\uc740 \uc815\ud569\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "LLM\uc740 \uac10\uc815 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uac04 \ud3c9\uac00\uc790\uc640 \ube44\uad50\ud560 \ub54c \ub354 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \ubcf4\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801 \ubc0f \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \uac04\uc758 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131\uacfc \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac10\uc815\uc740 \ud3c9\ubc94\ud55c \uc77c\uacfc \uace0\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub808\uc2a4 \uc791\uc5c5 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uac04\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uacfc \uc778\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ud070 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce69\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc744 \uc77c\uc0c1 \uc0dd\ud65c\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud560 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub17c\uc758\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c\ub4e4\uc774 \uac10\uc815\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd80\ud558\uac00 \uac78\ub9b0 \uc790\uadf9\uc774\ub098 \uc0c1\ud669\uc744 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc774\ud574\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacbd\uc6b0, \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc778\uac04 \ud589\ub3d9\uacfc\uc758 \uc815\ud569\uc131\uc740 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc5ed\ud560\uc774\ub098 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c LLM\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \uc54c\ub9ac\ub294 \ub370 \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc774 \ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc774\ud574\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc744 \uc8fc\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc778\uac04\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uac10\uc815 \ucf58\ud150\uce20\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud3c9\uac00\ub41c \ub2e8\uc5b4\uc640 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc778\uae30 LLM\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc774\ub04c\uc5b4\ub0c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \ud3c9\uac00 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud560 \ub54c, GPT-4o\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc591\uc2dd, \uc790\uadf9 \ubc0f \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00 \ucc99\ub3c4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uac04 \ucc38\uac00\uc790\ub4e4\uacfc \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc720\uc0ac\ud558\uac8c \ubc18\uc751\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4(\ub9ce\uc740 \uacbd\uc6b0 r = 0.9 \uc774\uc0c1). \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uac01\uc131 \ud3c9\uac00 \uc810\uc218\ub294 \uc778\uac04 \ud3c9\uac00\uc790\uc640 LLM \ud3c9\uac00\uc790 \uac04\uc5d0 \ub35c \uc77c\uce58\ud588\uc73c\uba70, \ud589\ubcf5\ub3c4 \ud3c9\uac00\ub294 \uac00\uc7a5 \ub192\uc740 \uc77c\uce58\ub97c \ubcf4\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc804\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c LLM\uc740 5\uac00\uc9c0 \ubc94\uc8fc(\ud589\ubcf5, \ubd84\ub178, \uc2ac\ud514, \ub450\ub824\uc6c0, \ud610\uc624) \uac10\uc815 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ub354 \uc798 \uc815\ud569\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c, LLM\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00\ub294 \uc778\uac04 \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \ub354 \ub3d9\uc9c8\uc801\uc774\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uac10\uc815 \uc790\uadf9\uc744 \ud574\uc11d\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud558\uae30 \uc2dc\uc791\ud558\uba70, \uc8fc\uc694 \ud589\ub3d9 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801 \ubc0f \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \uac04\uc758 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131\uacfc \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Comprehensive\nmalware detection requires dynamic analysis of execution behavior in addition\nto static analysis of binaries. Safe execution of malware in a manner that\ncaptures relevant behaviors via side-channels requires a sandbox environment.\nExisting Linux sandboxes are built for specific tasks, only capture one or two\nside-channels, and do not offer customization for different analysis tasks. We\npresent the SaMOSA Linux sandbox that allows emulation of Linux malwares while\ncapturing time-synchronized side-channels from four sources. SaMOSA\nadditionally provides emulation of network services via FakeNet, and allows\norchestration and customization of the sandbox environment via pipeline hooks.\nIn comparison to existing Linux sandboxes, SaMOSA captures more side-channels\nnamely system calls, network activity, disk activity, and hardware performance\ncounters.

Recent works,\nsuch as ChatAFL, have integrated Large Language Models (LLMs) to guide protocol\nfuzzing and address these limitations, pushing protocol fuzzers to wider\nexploration of the protocol state space. But ChatAFL still faces issues like\nunreliable output, LLM hallucinations, and assumptions of LLM knowledge about\nprotocol specifications. This paper introduces MultiFuzz, a novel dense\nretrieval-based multi-agent system designed to overcome these limitations by\nintegrating semantic-aware context retrieval, specialized agents, and\nstructured tool-assisted reasoning. MultiFuzz utilizes agentic chunks of\nprotocol documentation (RFC Documents) to build embeddings in a vector database\nfor a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline, enabling agents to\ngenerate more reliable and structured outputs, enhancing the fuzzer in mutating\nprotocol messages with enhanced state coverage and adherence to syntactic\nconstraints. The framework decomposes the fuzzing process into modular groups\nof agents that collaborate through chain-of-thought reasoning to dynamically\nadapt fuzzing strategies based on the retrieved contextual knowledge.\nExperimental evaluations on the Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) demonstrate\nthat MultiFuzz significantly improves branch coverage and explores deeper\nprotocol states and transitions over state-of-the-art (SOTA) fuzzers such as\nNSFuzz, AFLNet, and ChatAFL.

Interpolation methods usually perform\nwell with Strict Sense Stationary (SSS) data.

Hence, Hitori provides an excellent testing ground for a flexible\ncombination of SAT solvers and LLMs. We have implemented a tool that assists\nhumans in solving Hitori puzzles, and we present experimental evidence of its\neffectiveness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815\uc758 \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e0\uacbd\uae30\ud638\uc801 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uacb0\uc815 \uc808\ucc28\uc640 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uac15\uc810\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc758 \uc124\uba85 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uacfc \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc2e0\uacbd\uae30\ud638\uc801 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "Hitori \ud37c\uc990\uc758 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uad6c\ud604\ud558\uace0, SAT \ud574\uacb0\uae30\uc640 LLM\uc744 \uc720\uc5f0\ud558\uac8c \uacb0\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "Hitori \ud37c\uc990 \ud574\uacb0\uc744 \ub3d5\ub294 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc785\uc99d\ud558\ub294 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801 \uc99d\uac70\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc2e0\uacbd\uae30\ud638\uc801 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 Hitori \ud37c\uc990\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ud2b9\uc815 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uacb0\uc815 \uc808\ucc28\uc640 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \uac15\uc810\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uacb0\uc815 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4 \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e0\uacbd\uae30\ud638\uc801 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Hitori \ud37c\uc990 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc124\uba85\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

A valuable\nstep in reducing poaching is to forecast poacher behavior, which can inform\npatrol planning and other conservation interventions. Existing poaching\nprediction methods based on linear models or decision trees lack the\nexpressivity to capture complex, nonlinear spatiotemporal patterns. Recent\nadvances in generative modeling, particularly flow matching, offer a more\nflexible alternative. However, training such models on real-world poaching data\nfaces two central obstacles: imperfect detection of poaching events and limited\ndata. To address imperfect detection, we integrate flow matching with an\noccupancy-based detection model and train the flow in latent space to infer the\nunderlying occupancy state. To mitigate data scarcity, we adopt a composite\nflow initialized from a linear-model prediction rather than random noise which\nis the standard in diffusion models, injecting prior knowledge and improving\ngeneralization.

Two learning-based mechanisms are used\nto develop the edge selector: a simple tabular binary classifier and a Graph\nNeural Network (GNN). The tabular classifier employs Gradient Boosting Trees\nand Feedforward Neural Network as the baseline algorithms. Adjustments to the\ndecision threshold are also applied to handle the class imbalance in the\nproblem instance. An alternative mechanism employs the GNN to utilize graph\nstructure for direct solution edge prediction, with the objective of guiding\nlocal search by predicting prohibited moves.

However, the process remains time-consuming and error-prone, heavily\nrelying on domain experts. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in\naddressing these challenges through their natural language understanding and\nreasoning capabilities, current approaches face three critical limitations:\nhigh benchmark labeling error rates reaching up to 42\\%, narrow evaluation\nscope that only considers optimal values, and computational inefficiency due to\nheavy reliance on multi-agent systems or model fine-tuning. In this work, we\nfirst enhance existing datasets through systematic error correction and more\ncomprehensive annotation. Additionally, we introduce LogiOR, a new optimization\nmodeling benchmark from the logistics domain, containing more complex problems\nwith standardized annotations.

To address these challenges, this paper proposes\nthe \"Network Behavior Lifecycle\" model, which divides network behavior into 6\nstages and systematically analyzes the behavioral differences between humans\nand agents at each stage. Based on these insights, the paper further introduces\nthe \"Agent for Agent (A4A)\" paradigm and the \"Human-Agent Behavioral Disparity\n(HABD)\" model, which examine the fundamental distinctions between human and\nagent behaviors across 5 dimensions: decision mechanism, execution efficiency,\nintention-behavior consistency, behavioral inertia, and irrational patterns.\nThe effectiveness of the model is verified through real-world cases such as red\nteam penetration and blue team defense.

In this study, the\nlong-standing issue of false positives from publicly accessible alerts in\nAmazon S3, as generated by a licensed cloud-native security solution, is\nexamined. In a simulated production test environment, which consisted of over\n1,000 Amazon S3 buckets with diverse access configurations, it was discovered\nthat over 80\\% of the alerts generated by default rules were classified as\nfalse positives, thus demonstrating the severity of the detection issue. This\nseverely impacted detection accuracy and generated a heavier workload for\nanalysts due to redundant manual triage efforts. For addressing this problem,\ncustom detection logic was created as an exercise of the native rule\ncustomization capabilities of the solution.

Structured Thought-Action Sequences for Epistemic Reasoning in LLMs", "comment": "Accepted at ICSR25", "summary": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and reasoning frameworks have\nopened new possibilities for improving the perspective -taking capabilities of\nautonomous agents. However, tasks that involve active perception, collaborative\nreasoning, and perspective taking (understanding what another agent can see or\nknows) pose persistent challenges for current LLM-based systems. This study\ninvestigates the potential of structured examples derived from transformed\nsolution graphs generated by the Fast Downward planner to improve the\nperformance of LLM-based agents within a ReAct framework. We propose a\nstructured solution-processing pipeline that generates three distinct\ncategories of examples: optimal goal paths (G-type), informative node paths\n(E-type), and step-by-step optimal decision sequences contrasting alternative\nactions (L-type). These solutions are further converted into ``thought-action''\nexamples by prompting an LLM to explicitly articulate the reasoning behind each\ndecision. While L-type examples slightly reduce clarification requests and\noverall action steps, they do not yield consistent improvements. Agents are\nsuccessful in tasks requiring basic attentional filtering but struggle in\nscenarios that required mentalising about occluded spaces or weighing the costs\nof epistemic actions. These findings suggest that structured examples alone are\ninsufficient for robust perspective-taking, underscoring the need for explicit\nbelief tracking, cost modelling, and richer environments to enable socially\ngrounded collaboration in LLM-based agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uad00\uc810 \uc774\ud574 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30

To research, test, and validate security\nmeasures protecting industrial networks against such cyber-attacks, the\nsecurity community relies on testbeds to simulate industrial systems, as\nutilizing live systems endangers costly components or even human life. However,\nexisting testbeds focus on individual parts of typically complex production\nlines in industrial factories. Consequently, the impact of cyber-attacks on\nindustrial networks as well as the effectiveness of countermeasures cannot be\nevaluated in an end-to-end manner. To address this issue and facilitate\nresearch on novel security mechanisms, we present CoFacS, the first COmplete\nFACtory Simulation that replicates an entire production line and affords the\nintegration of real-life industrial applications. To showcase that CoFacS\naccurately captures real-world behavior, we validate it against a physical\nmodel factory widely used in security research.

To address these issues, this\npaper proposes a GAN-enhanced generalizable model, named GEPD, specifically for\nEEG-based cross-dataset classification of Parkinson's disease.First, we design\na generative network that creates fusion EEG data by controlling the\ndistribution similarity between generated data and real data.In addition, an\nEEG signal quality assessment model is designed to ensure the quality of\ngenerated data great.Second, we design a classification network that utilizes a\ncombination of multiple convolutional neural networks to effectively capture\nthe time-frequency characteristics of EEG signals, while maintaining a\ngeneralizable structure and ensuring easy convergence.This work is dedicated to\nutilizing intelligent methods to study pathological manifestations, aiming to\nfacilitate the diagnosis and monitoring of neurological diseases.The evaluation\nresults demonstrate that our model performs comparably to state-of-the-art\nmodels in cross-dataset settings, achieving an accuracy of 84.3% and an\nF1-score of 84.0%, showcasing the generalizability of the proposed model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 EEG

Existing attack methods, however, often rely\non idealized assumptions and fail to remain effective under real-world\nconstraints, such as limited attacker control, non-IID data distributions, and\nthe presence of diverse defense mechanisms. To address this gap, we propose\nDOPA (Divergent Optimization Path Attack), a novel framework that simulates\nheterogeneous local training dynamics and seeks consensus across divergent\noptimization trajectories to craft universally effective and stealthy backdoor\ntriggers. By leveraging consistency signals across simulated paths to guide\noptimization, DOPA overcomes the challenge of heterogeneity-induced instability\nand achieves practical attack viability under stringent federated constraints.\nWe validate DOPA on a comprehensive suite of 12 defense strategies, two model\narchitectures (ResNet18/VGG16), two datasets (CIFAR-10/TinyImageNet), and both\nmild and extreme non-IID settings. Despite operating under a single-client,\nblack-box, and sparsely participating threat model, DOPA consistently achieves\nhigh attack success, minimal accuracy degradation, low runtime, and long-term\npersistence.

Urban\nflooding often leads to severe traffic congestion and service disruptions,\nthreatening public safety and mobility. However, effective decision making\nremains hindered by three key challenges: (1) managing trade-offs among\ncompeting goals (e.g., traffic flow, task completion, and risk mitigation)\nrequires dynamic, context-aware strategies; (2) rapidly evolving environmental\nconditions render static rules inadequate; and (3) LLM-generated strategies\nfrequently suffer from semantic instability and execution inconsistency.\nExisting methods fail to align perception, global optimization, and multi-agent\ncoordination within a unified framework. To tackle these challenges, we\nintroduce H-J, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that integrates\nknowledge-guided prompting, entropy-constrained generation, and feedback-driven\noptimization. The framework establishes a closed-loop pipeline spanning from\nmulti-source perception to strategic execution and continuous refinement. We\nevaluate H-J on real-world urban topology and rainfall data under three\nrepresentative conditions: extreme rainfall, intermittent bursts, and daily\nlight rain. Experiments show that H-J outperforms rule-based and\nreinforcement-learning baselines in traffic smoothness, task success rate, and\nsystem robustness.

Edit distance\ncomputations are essential in applications across finance and genomics, such as\nDNA sequence alignment. We introduce an optimised algorithm that significantly\nreduces the cost of edit distance calculations called Leuvenshtein. This\nalgorithm specifically reduces the number of programmable bootstraps (PBS)\nneeded per cell of the calculation, lowering it from approximately 94\noperations -- required by the conventional Wagner-Fisher algorithm -- to just\n1. Additionally, we propose an efficient method for performing equality checks\non characters, reducing ASCII character comparisons to only 2 PBS operations.\nFinally, we explore the potential for further performance improvements by\nutilising preprocessing when one of the input strings is unencrypted. Our\nLeuvenshtein achieves up to $278\\times$ faster performance compared to the best\navailable TFHE implementation and up to $39\\times$ faster than an optimised\nimplementation of the Wagner-Fisher algorithm.

However,\nexisting benchmarks are overly simplistic and fail to capture real application\nchallenges such as long-horizon reasoning and large, unfamiliar tool spaces. To\naddress this critical gap, we introduce MCP-Universe, the first comprehensive\nbenchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs in realistic and hard tasks\nthrough interaction with real-world MCP servers. Our benchmark encompasses 6\ncore domains spanning 11 different MCP servers: Location Navigation, Repository\nManagement, Financial Analysis, 3D Design, Browser Automation, and Web\nSearching. To ensure rigorous evaluation, we implement execution-based\nevaluators, including format evaluators for agent format compliance, static\nevaluators for time-invariant content matching, and dynamic evaluators that\nautomatically retrieve real-time ground truth for temporally sensitive tasks.\nThrough extensive evaluation of leading LLMs, we find that even SOTA models\nsuch as GPT-5 (43.72%), Grok-4 (33.33%) and Claude-4.0-Sonnet (29.44%) exhibit\nsignificant performance limitations. In addition, our benchmark poses a\nsignificant long-context challenge for LLM agents, as the number of input\ntokens increases rapidly with the number of interaction steps. Moreover, it\nintroduces an unknown-tools challenge, as LLM agents often lack familiarity\nwith the precise usage of the MCP servers. Notably, enterprise-level agents\nlike Cursor cannot achieve better performance than standard ReAct frameworks.\nBeyond evaluation, we open-source our extensible evaluation framework with UI\nsupport,

ML models have\ndemonstrated their effectiveness in fraud detection task, in particular with\nthe tabular dataset. While adversarial attacks have been extensively studied in\ncomputer vision and deep learning, their impacts on the ML models, particularly\nthose trained on CCFD tabular datasets, remains largely unexplored. These\nlatent vulnerabilities pose significant threats to the security and stability\nof the financial industry, especially in high-value transactions where losses\ncould be substantial. To address this gap, in this paper, we present a holistic\nframework that investigate the robustness of CCFD ML model against adversarial\nperturbations under different circumstances. Specifically, the gradient-based\nattack methods are incorporated into the tabular credit card transaction data\nin both black- and white-box adversarial attacks settings. Our findings confirm\nthat tabular data is also susceptible to subtle perturbations, highlighting the\nneed for heightened awareness among financial technology practitioners\nregarding ML model security and trustworthiness. Furthermore, the experiments\nby transferring adversarial samples from gradient-based attack method to\nnon-gradient-based models also verify our findings. Our results demonstrate\nthat such attacks remain effective, emphasizing the necessity of developing\nrobust defenses for CCFD algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc2e0\uc6a9 \uce74\ub4dc \uc0ac\uae30 \ud0d0\uc9c0(CCFD)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uba38\uc2e0 \ub7ec\ub2dd\uc758 \uacac\uace0\uc131\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud55c \ub17c\ubb38\uc73c\ub85c, \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubbfc\uac10\uc131\uc744 \ubc1d\ud600\ub0c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae08\uc735 \uc190\uc2e4\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0ac\uae30 \uac70\ub798\ub97c \uc815\ud655\ud788 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc2e0\uc6a9 \uce74\ub4dc \uac70\ub798 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 \ubc0f \ud654\uc774\ud2b8\ubc15\uc2a4 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uacf5\uaca9 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \uae30\ubc18 \uacf5\uaca9 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud588\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud45c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \ubbf8\uc138\ud55c \uad50\ub780\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uc0ac\uc2e4\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud588\uace0, \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \uae30\ubc18 \uacf5\uaca9\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130\uc758 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc0d8\ud50c \uc804\uc774 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \ub610\ud55c \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc8fc\uc7a5\uc744 \ub4b7\ubc1b\uce68\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc2e0\uc6a9 \uce74\ub4dc \uc0ac\uae30 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ubc29\uc5b4 \uccb4\uacc4\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uac15\uc870\ub41c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc2e0\uc6a9 \uce74\ub4dc \uc0ac\uae30 \ud0d0\uc9c0(CCFD)\ub294 \uae08\uc735 \ubd80\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c \uba38\uc2e0 \ub7ec\ub2dd(ML)\uc758 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc73c\ub85c, \uc0ac\uae30 \uac70\ub798\ub97c \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc7ac\uc815\uc801 \uc190\uc2e4\uc744 \uc644\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Unlike traditional power grids, smart grids\nbenefit from two-way communication through AMI, which surpasses earlier\nautomated meter reading (AMR). AMI enables diverse demand- and supply-side\nutilities such as accurate billing, outage detection, real-time grid control,\nload forecasting, and value-added services. Smart meters play a key role by\ndelivering consumption values at predefined intervals to the utility provider\n(UP). However, such reports may raise privacy concerns, as adversaries can\ninfer lifestyle patterns, political orientations, and the types of electrical\ndevices in a household, or even sell the data to third parties (TP) such as\ninsurers. In this paper, we propose a lightweight, privacy-preserving smart\nmetering protocol for incentive-based value-added services. The scheme employs\nlocal differential privacy, hash chains, blind digital signatures, pseudonyms,\ntemporal aggregation, and anonymous overlay networks to report coarse-grained\nvalues with adjustable granularity to the UP. This protects consumers' privacy\nwhile preserving data utility. The scheme prevents identity disclosure while\nenabling automatic token redemption.

The proposed methodology\nintegrates Productivity Index (PI)-driven feature selection, a concept derived\nfrom reservoir engineering, with Inductive Conformal Prediction (ICP) for\nrigorous uncertainty quantification. Utilizing historical data from the Volve\n(wells PF14, PF12) and Norne (well E1H) oil fields, this study investigates the\nefficacy of various predictive algorithms-namely Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM),\nBidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and eXtreme Gradient\nBoosting (XGBoost) - in forecasting historical oil production rates (OPR_H).\nAll the models achieved \"out-of-sample\" production forecasts for an upcoming\nfuture timeframe. Model performance was comprehensively evaluated using\ntraditional error metrics (e.g., MAE) supplemented by Forecast Bias and\nPrediction Direction Accuracy (PDA) to assess bias and trend-capturing\ncapabilities. The PI-based feature selection effectively reduced input\ndimensionality compared to conventional numerical simulation workflows. The\nuncertainty quantification was addressed using the ICP framework, a\ndistribution-free approach that guarantees valid prediction intervals (e.g.,\n95% coverage) without reliance on distributional assumptions, offering a\ndistinct advantage over traditional confidence intervals, particularly for\ncomplex, non-normal data. Results demonstrated the superior performance of the\nLSTM model, achieving the lowest MAE on test (19.468) and genuine out-of-sample\nforecast data (29.638) for well PF14, with subsequent validation on Norne well\nE1H.

This enables smart meters to report consumption values at predefined\nintervals to utility providers for purposes including demand balancing, load\nforecasting, dynamic billing, and operational efficiency. Compared to\ntraditional power grids, smart grids offer advantages such as enhanced\nreliability, improved energy efficiency, and increased security. However,\nutility providers can compromise user privacy by analyzing fine-grained\nreadings and extracting individuals' daily activities from this time-series\ndata. To address this concern, we propose a collusion-resistant,\nprivacy-preserving aggregation protocol for smart metering in operational\nservices. Our protocol ensures privacy by leveraging techniques such as\npartially additive homomorphic encryption, aggregation, data perturbation, and\ndata minimization. The scheme aggregates perturbed readings using the additive\nhomomorphic property of the Paillier cryptosystem to provide results for\nmultiple operational purposes. We evaluate the protocol in terms of both\nperformance and privacy. Computational, memory, and communication overhead were\nexamined. The total execution time with 1024-bit key size is about 2.21\nseconds. We also evaluated privacy through the normalized conditional entropy\n(NCE) metric. Higher NCE values, closer to 1, indicate stronger privacy. By\nincreasing noise scale, the NCE value rises, showing perturbed values retain\nminimal information about the original, thereby reducing risks.

For years, robustness to such perturbations was pursued by\ntraining models from scratch (i.e., with random initializations) using\nspecialized loss objectives. Recently, robust fine-tuning has emerged as a more\nefficient alternative: instead of training from scratch, pretrained models are\nadapted to maximize predictive performance and robustness. To conduct robust\nfine-tuning, practitioners design an optimization strategy that includes the\nmodel update protocol (e.g., full or partial) and the specialized loss\nobjective. Additional design choices include the architecture type and size,\nand the pretrained representation. These design choices affect robust\ngeneralization, which is the model's ability to maintain performance when\nexposed to new and unseen perturbations at test time. Understanding how these\ndesign choices influence generalization remains an open question with\nsignificant practical implications. In response, we present an empirical study\nspanning 6 datasets, 40 pretrained architectures, 2 specialized losses, and 3\nadaptation protocols, yielding 1,440 training configurations and 7,200\nrobustness measurements across five perturbation types. To our knowledge, this\nis the most diverse and comprehensive benchmark of robust fine-tuning to date.\nWhile attention-based architectures and robust pretrained representations are\nincreasingly popular, we find that convolutional neural networks pretrained in\na supervised manner on large datasets often perform best.

However, due to the limitations of earlier models,\ntraditional REC benchmarks either rely solely on intra-image cues or lack\nsufficiently fine-grained instance annotations, making them inadequate for\nevaluating the reasoning capabilities of Multi-modal Large Language Models\n(MLLMs). To address this gap, we propose a new benchmark, KnowDR-REC,\ncharacterized by three key features: Firstly, it is built upon real-world\nknowledge, requiring fine-grained multimodal reasoning across text and image.\nSecondly, the dataset includes elaborately constructed negative samples via\nfine-grained expression editing, designed to evaluate a model's robustness and\nanti-hallucination ability. Lastly, we introduce three novel evaluation metrics\nto systematically explore the model's internal reasoning process. We evaluate\n16 state-of-the-art multimodal models on KnowDR-REC, with experimental results\nshowing that existing MLLMs still struggle with knowledge-driven visual\ngrounding tasks. Furthermore, we observe a decoupling between textual\nunderstanding and visual grounding in MLLMs, where many models are\nsignificantly influenced by memorized shortcut correlations, which severely\naffect their behavior on our benchmark and hinder genuine multimodal reasoning.\nWe anticipate that the proposed benchmark will inspire future research towards\ndeveloping more robust, interpretable, and knowledge-intensive visual grounding\nframeworks, driving the development of more reliable and robust multimodal\nsystems for complex real-world scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ub0b4\uc758 \ubaa9\ud45c \uac1d\uccb4\ub97c \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \uac10\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc778 KnowDR-REC\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 REC \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub294 MLLMs\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ubd80\uc801\ud569\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "KnowDR-REC \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub294 \uc2e4\uc138\uacc4 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uba70, \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc640 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uac04\uc758 \uc138\ubc00\ud55c \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \ubd80\uc815\uc801 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \uc815\uad50\ud558\uac8c \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uac15\uc778\uc131\uacfc \ubc18\ud658\uc0c1 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "16\uac1c\uc758 \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 KnowDR-REC\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, \uae30\uc874 MLLMs\uac00 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \uadf8\ub77c\uc6b4\ub529 \uacfc\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub294 \ub354 \uac15\ub825\ud558\uace0 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc9d1\uc57d\uc801 \uc2dc\uac01\uc801 \uadf8\ub77c\uc6b4\ub529 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud5a5\ud6c4 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0 \uc601\uac10\uc744 \uc904 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \uae30\ub300\ub41c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ucc38\uc870 \ud45c\ud604 \uc774\ud574(REC)\ub294 \uc8fc\uc5b4\uc9c4 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e8\uc77c \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa9\ud45c \uac1d\uccb4\ub97c \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \uac10\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \uc778\uae30 \uc788\ub294 \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \uc791\uc5c5\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\uc804 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 REC \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\ub294 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud788 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ub0b4\ubd80 \ub2e8\uc11c\uc5d0\ub9cc \uc758\uc874\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \uc138\ubc00\ud55c \uc778\uc2a4\ud134\uc2a4 \uc8fc\uc11d\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(MLLM)\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ubd88\ucda9\ubd84\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uc18c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc640 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uac04\uc758 \uc138\ubc00\ud55c \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \uc2e4\uc138\uacc4 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc778 KnowDR-REC\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub450 \ubc88\uc9f8\ub85c, \uc774 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uac15\uc778\uc131\uacfc \ubc18 \ud658\uc0c1 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc138\ubd80 \ud45c\ud604 \uc218\uc815 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc815\uad50\ud558\uac8c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \ubd80\uc815\uc801 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ub0b4\ubd80 \ucd94\ub860 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud3c9\uac00 \uc9c0\ud45c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Advanced\nmetering infrastructure (AMI) plays a crucial role in smart grids by\nfacilitating two-way communication between smart meters and the utility\nprovider. This bidirectional communication allows intelligent meters to report\nfine-grained consumption data at predefined intervals, enabling accurate\nbilling, efficient grid monitoring and management, and rapid outage detection.\nHowever, the collection of detailed consumption data can inadvertently disclose\nconsumers' daily activities, raising privacy concerns and potentially leading\nto privacy violations. To address these issues and preserve individuals'\nprivacy, we propose a lightweight privacy-preserving smart metering protocol\nspecifically designed to support real-time tariff billing service with dynamic\npolicy adjustment. Our scheme employs an efficient data perturbation technique\nto obscure precise energy usage data from internal adversaries, including the\nintermediary gateways and the utility provider. Subsequently, we validate the\nefficiency and security of our protocol through comprehensive performance and\nprivacy evaluations. We examined the computational, memory, and communication\noverhead of the proposed scheme. The execution time of our secure and\nprivacy-aware billing system is approximately 3.94540 seconds for a complete\nyear. Furthermore, we employed the Jensen-Shannon divergence as a privacy\nmetric to demonstrate that our protocol can effectively safeguard users'\nprivacy by increasing the noise scale.", "AI": {"tldr":

However, these networks face a critical challenge in continuous\nlearning: catastrophic forgetting, where previously acquired knowledge is\noverwritten when new tasks are learned. This limitation contrasts with the\nhuman brain's ability to retain and integrate both old and new knowledge, aided\nby processes like memory consolidation during sleep through the replay of\nlearned information. To address this challenge in RNNs, here we propose a\nsleep-like replay consolidation (SRC) algorithm for EP-trained RNNs. We found\nthat SRC significantly improves RNN's resilience to catastrophic forgetting in\ncontinuous learning scenarios. In class-incremental learning with SRC\nimplemented after each new task training, the EP-trained multilayer RNN model\n(MRNN-EP) performed significantly better compared to feedforward networks\nincorporating several well-established regularization techniques. The MRNN-EP\nperformed on par with MRNN trained using Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)\nwhen both were equipped with SRC on MNIST data and surpassed BPTT-based models\non the Fashion MNIST, Kuzushiji-MNIST, CIFAR10, and ImageNet datasets.\nCombining SRC with rehearsal, also known as \"awake replay\", further boosted the\nnetwork's ability to retain long-term knowledge while continuing to learn new\ntasks.

However, most\ndecision-support frameworks for incident response rely on a detailed system\nmodel that describes the incident, which restricts their practical utility. In\nthis paper, we address this limitation and present an online method for\nincident response planning under model misspecification, which we call MOBAL:\nMisspecified Online Bayesian Learning. MOBAL iteratively refines a conjecture\nabout the model through Bayesian learning as new information becomes available,\nwhich facilitates model adaptation as the incident unfolds. To determine\neffective responses online, we quantize the conjectured model into a finite\nMarkov model, which enables efficient response planning through dynamic\nprogramming.

Existing\nsemi-supervised methods typically apply consistency regularization on the\ngeneral regression task by generating pseudo-labels. However, these methods\nheavily rely on the quality of pseudo-labels, and direct regression fails to\nlearn the label distribution and can easily lead to overfitting. To address\nthese challenges, we introduce an end-to-end Decoupled Representation\ndistillation framework (DRILL) which is specially designed for the\nsemi-supervised regression task where we transform the general regression task\ninto a Discrete Distribution Estimation (DDE) task over multiple buckets to\nbetter capture the underlying label distribution and mitigate the risk of\noverfitting associated with direct regression. Then we employ the Decoupled\nDistribution Alignment (DDA) to align the target bucket and non-target bucket\nbetween teacher and student on the distribution of buckets, encouraging the\nstudent to learn more robust and generalized knowledge from the teacher.\nExtensive experiments conducted on datasets from diverse domains demonstrate\nthat the proposed DRILL has strong generalization and

Despite\nthis importance, due to the limitations of urban sensing techniques, the data\nquality from most sources is inadequate for monitoring crowd flow at each POI.\nThis renders the inference of accurate crowd flow from low-quality data a\ncritical and challenging task. The complexity is heightened by three key\nfactors: 1) \\emph{The scarcity and rarity of labeled data}, 2) \\emph{The\nintricate spatio-temporal dependencies among POIs}, and 3) \\emph{The myriad\ncorrelations between precise crowd flow and GPS reports}.\n  To address these challenges, we recast the crowd flow inference problem as a\nself-supervised attributed graph representation learning task and introduce a\nnovel \\underline{C}ontrastive \\underline{S}elf-learning framework for\n\\underline{S}patio-\\underline{T}emporal data (\\model). Our approach initiates\nwith the construction of a spatial adjacency graph founded on the POIs and\ntheir respective distances. We then employ a contrastive learning technique to\nexploit large volumes of unlabeled spatio-temporal data. We adopt a swapped\nprediction approach to anticipate the representation of the target subgraph\nfrom similar instances.

Building on SINDy (Sparse\nIdentification of Nonlinear Dynamics), our approach addresses key limitations\nthrough four innovations: symbolic parameterisation enabling physical\nparameters to vary within unified regression; Dimensional Similarity Filter\nenforcing unit-consistency whilst reducing candidate libraries;\nmemory-efficient Gram-matrix accumulation enabling batch processing; and\nensemble consensus with coefficient stability analysis for robust model\nidentification.\n  Validation on canonical one-dimensional benchmarks demonstrates reliable\nrecovery of governing equations across parameter ranges. Applied to filtered\nBurgers datasets, the framework discovers an SGS closure $\\tau_{\\mathrm{SGS}} =\n0.1603\\cdot\\Delta^2\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\bar{u}}{\\partial x}\\right)^2$,\ncorresponding to a Smagorinsky constant of approximately 0.4004. This\nrepresents autonomous discovery of Smagorinsky-type closure structure from data\nwithout prior theoretical assumptions.\n  The discovered model achieves $R^2 = 0.886$ across filter scales and\ndemonstrates improved prediction accuracy compared to classical closures.

Recently, EEG foundation\nmodels (FMs) have shown promising potential by adopting transformer\narchitectures and self-supervised pre-training methods from large language\nmodels (e.g., masked prediction) to learn representations from diverse EEG\ndata, followed by fine-tuning on specific EEG tasks. Nonetheless, these large\nmodels often incurred high computational costs during both training and\ninference, with only marginal performance improvements as model size increases.\nIn this work, we proposed EEG representation learning framework building upon\nGenerative Diffusion Model (EEGDM). Specifically, we developed structured\nstate-space model for diffusion pretraining (SSMDP) to better capture the\ntemporal dynamics of EEG signals and trained the architecture using a Denoising\nDiffusion Probabilistic Model. The resulting latent EEG representations were\nthen used for downstream classification tasks via our proposed latent fusion\ntransformer (LFT). To evaluate our method, we used the multi-event Temple\nUniversity EEG Event Corpus and compared EEGDM with current state-of-the-art\napproaches, including EEG FMs. Empirical results showed that our method\noutperformed existing methods while being approximately 19x more lightweight.\nThese findings suggested that EEGDM offered a promising alternative to current\nFMs. Our code is available at: https://github.com/jhpuah/EEGDM.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 EEG \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc788\ub294 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c EEGDM(Generative Diffusion Model)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uacbd\ub7c9\ud654\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c \uace0\uc131\ub2a5 \ubd84\ub958\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub1cc\ub97c \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\ud558\uace0 \uc2e0\uacbd \uc7a5\uc560\ub97c \uc9c4\ub2e8\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc694\ud55c EEG \uc2e0\ud638\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc788\ub294 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc5b4\ub835\ub2e4.", "method": "EEGDM \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc0c1\ud0dc \uacf5\uac04 \ubaa8\ub378(SSMDP)\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uace0 Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Temple University EEG Event Corpus\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ube44\uad50\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub098\uace0 \uc57d 19\ubc30 \uacbd\ub7c9\ud654\ub41c \uac83\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "EEGDM\uc740 \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ub300\ud615 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \ub300\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc804\uae30\ub1cc\ud30c\uac80\uc0ac(EEG)\ub294 \ub1cc \uac10\uc2dc \ubc0f \uc2e0\uacbd \uc7a5\uc560(\uc608: \uac04\uc9c8) \uc9c4\ub2e8\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c\uc600\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc6d0\uc2dc EEG \uc2e0\ud638\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc788\ub294 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ud55c\uc815\ub41c \uc8fc\uc11d\uacfc \ub192\uc740 \uc2e0\ud638 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \uacfc\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc EEG \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378(FMs)\uc740 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc640 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(\uc608: \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud0b9 \uc608\uce21)\ub85c\ubd80\ud130\uc758 \uc790\uae30 \uc9c0\ub3c4 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c EEG \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7fc\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub300\ud615 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ud6c8\ub828\uacfc \ucd94\ub860 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c \ub192\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud558\uba70, \ubaa8\ub378 \ud06c\uae30\uac00 \uc99d\uac00\ud574\ub3c4 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc774 \ubbf8\ubbf8\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc0dd\uc131\uc801 \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378(EEGDM)\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c EEG \ud45c\ud604 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 EEG \uc2e0\ud638\uc758 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \ub354 \uc798 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud655\uc0b0 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc0c1\ud0dc \uacf5\uac04 \ubaa8\ub378(SSMDP)\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uace0 Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacb0\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 EEG \ud45c\ud604\uc740 \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc7a0\uc7ac \uc735\ud569 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30(LFT)\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e4\uc6b4\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9bc \ubd84\ub958 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 Temple University EEG Event Corpus\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uace0 EEG FMs\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ucd5c\uc2e0 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uacfc EEGDM\uc744 \ube44\uad50\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub098\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc57d 19\ubc30 \ub354 \uacbd\ub7c9\ud654\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc1c\uacac\uc740 EEGDM\uc774 \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 FMs\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \ub300\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud568\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

This paradigm has\ninspired the development of scientific foundation models (FMs). However,\napplying this capability to experimental particle physics is challenging due to\nthe sparse, spatially distributed nature of detector data, which differs\ndramatically from natural language. This work addresses if an FM for particle\nphysics can scale and generalize across diverse tasks. We introduce a new\ndataset with more than 11 million particle collision events and a suite of\ndownstream tasks and labeled data for evaluation. We propose a novel\nself-supervised training method for detector data and demonstrate its neural\nscalability with models that feature up to 188 million parameters. With frozen\nweights and task-specific adapters, this FM consistently outperforms baseline\nmodels across all downstream tasks. The performance also exhibits robust\ndata-efficient adaptation.

While traditional anomaly detection methods\nprimarily focus on individual movement patterns (e.g., a child should stay at\nhome at night), collective anomaly detection aims to identify irregularities in\ncollective mobility behaviors across individuals (e.g., a child is at home\nalone while the parents are elsewhere) and remains an underexplored challenge.\nUnlike individual anomalies, collective anomalies require modeling\nspatiotemporal dependencies between individuals, introducing additional\ncomplexity. To address this gap, we propose CoBAD, a novel model designed to\ncapture Collective Behaviors for human mobility Anomaly Detection. We first\nformulate the problem as unsupervised learning over Collective Event Sequences\n(CES) with a co-occurrence event graph, where CES represents the event\nsequences of related individuals. CoBAD then employs a two-stage attention\nmechanism to model both the individual mobility patterns and the interactions\nacross multiple individuals. Pre-trained on large-scale collective behavior\ndata through masked event and link reconstruction tasks, CoBAD is able to\ndetect two types of collective anomalies: unexpected co-occurrence anomalies\nand absence anomalies, the latter of which has been largely overlooked in prior\nwork. Extensive experiments on large-scale mobility datasets demonstrate that\nCoBAD significantly outperforms existing anomaly detection baselines, achieving\nan improvement of 13%-18% in AUCROC and 19%-70% in AUCPR.

To address the lack\nof explainability of GNNs on KGs, recent works extract Datalog rules from GNNs\nwith provable correspondence guarantees. The extracted rules can be used to\nexplain the GNN's predictions; furthermore, they can help characterise the\nexpressive power of various GNN models. However, these works address only a\nform of link prediction based on a restricted, low-expressivity graph\nencoding/decoding method. In this paper, we consider a more general and popular\napproach for link prediction where a scoring function is used to decode the GNN\noutput into fact predictions. We show how GNNs and scoring functions can be\nadapted to be monotonic, use the monotonicity to extract sound rules for\nexplaining predictions, and leverage existing results about the kind of rules\nthat scoring functions can capture. We also define procedures for obtaining\nequivalent Datalog programs for certain classes of monotonic GNNs with scoring\nfunctions. Our experiments show that, on link prediction benchmarks, monotonic\nGNNs and scoring functions perform well in practice and yield many sound rules.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub9c1\ud06c \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, GNN\uacfc \uc810\uc218 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \uc870\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud558\ub294 \uaddc\uce59\uc744 \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8ec\ub2e4.", "motivation": "GNN\uc758 \uc124\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubaa8\ub178\ud1a0\ub2c9\ud55c GNN\uacfc \uc810\uc218 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \uc870\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud558\ub294 \uaddc\uce59\uc744 \ucd94\ucd9c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub9c1\ud06c \uc608\uce21 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa8\ub178\ud1a0\ub2c9 GNN\uacfc \uc810\uc218 \ud568\uc218\uac00 \uc2e4\uc81c\ub85c \uc798 \uc218\ud589\ub418\uba70 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc788\ub294 \uaddc\uce59\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubaa8\ub178\ud1a0\ub2c9 GNN\uacfc \uc810\uc218 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uba74 \ub9c1\ud06c \uc608\uce21\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc5bb\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(GNN)\uc740 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uadf8\ub798\ud504(KG)\uc5d0\uc11c \ub204\ub77d\ub41c \uc774\uc9c4 \uc0ac\uc2e4\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \ub9c1\ud06c \uc608\uce21 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uc790\uc8fc \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub41c\ub2e4.

Viewed more broadly, they separate what is known about the\nenvironment, captured by the reward mechanism, from what remains unknown and\nmust be discovered through sampling. This separation supports techniques such\nas counterfactual experience generation and reward shaping, which reduce sample\ncomplexity and speed up learning. We introduce physics-informed reward machines\n(pRMs), a symbolic machine designed to express complex learning objectives and\nreward structures for RL agents, thereby enabling more programmable,\nexpressive, and efficient learning.

Hypergraph neural\nnetworks, which rely on message-passing between nodes over hyperedges to learn\nlatent representations, have emerged as the method of choice for predictive\ntasks in many of these domains. These approaches typically perform only a small\nnumber of message-passing rounds to learn the representations, which they then\nutilize for predictions. The small number of message-passing rounds comes at a\ncost, as the representations only capture local information and forego\nlong-range high-order dependencies. However, as we demonstrate, blindly\nincreasing the message-passing rounds to capture long-range dependency also\ndegrades the performance of hyper-graph neural networks.\n  Recent works have demonstrated that implicit graph neural networks capture\nlong-range dependencies in standard graphs while maintaining performance.\nDespite their popularity, prior work has not studied long-range dependency\nissues on hypergraph neural networks. Here, we first demonstrate that existing\nhypergraph neural networks lose predictive power when aggregating more\ninformation to capture long-range dependency. We then propose Implicit\nHypergraph Neural Network (IHNN), a novel framework that jointly learns\nfixed-point representations for both nodes and hyperedges in an end-to-end\nmanner to alleviate this issue. Leveraging implicit differentiation, we\nintroduce a tractable projected gradient descent approach to train the model\nefficiently. Extensive experiments on real-world hypergraphs for node\nclassification demonstrate that IHNN outperforms the closest prior works in\nmost settings, establishing a new state-of-the-art in hypergraph

Growing interest in scalable and\nreusable control policies translate also in a demand for morphological\ngeneralization, the ability of control policies to cope with different\nkinematic structures. Graph-based policy architectures provide a natural and\neffective mechanism to encode such structural differences. However, while these\narchitectures accommodate variable morphologies, the behavior of trust region\nmethods under varying action space dimensionality remains poorly understood. To\nthis end, we conduct a theoretical analysis of trust region-based policy\noptimization methods, focusing on both Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO)\nand its widely used first-order approximation, Proximal Policy Optimization\n(PPO). The goal is to demonstrate how varying action space dimensionality\ninfluence the optimization landscape, particularly under the constraints\nimposed by KL-divergence or policy clipping penalties. Complementing the\ntheoretical insights, an empirical evaluation under morphological variation is\ncarried out using the Gymnasium Swimmer environment. This benchmark offers a\nsystematically controlled setting for varying the kinematic structure without\naltering the underlying task, making it particularly well-suited to study\nmorphological

This issue is particularly\npronounced in university campuses, where students need to find vacant parking\nspots quickly and conveniently during class timings. The limited availability\nof parking spaces on campuses underscores the necessity of implementing\nefficient systems to allocate vacant parking spots effectively. We propose a\nsmart framework that integrates multiple data sources, including street maps,\nmobility, and meteorological data, through a spatial join operation to capture\nparking behavior and vehicle movement patterns over the span of 3 consecutive\ndays with an hourly duration between 7AM till 3PM. The system will not require\nany sensing tools to be installed in the street or in the parking area to\nprovide its services since all the data needed will be collected using location\nservices. The framework will use the expected parking entrance and time to\nspecify a suitable parking area. Several forecasting models, namely, Linear\nRegression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest Regression (RFR),\nand Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), are evaluated. Hyperparameter tuning was\nemployed using grid search, and model performance is assessed using Root Mean\nSquared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Coefficient of\nDetermination (R2). Random Forest Regression achieved the lowest RMSE of 0.142\nand highest R2 of 0.582. However, given the time-series nature of the task, an\nLSTM model may perform better with additional data and longer timesteps.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub3c4\uc2dc \uc778\uad6c \uc99d\uac00\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \uc8fc\ucc28 \uad00\ub9ac \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc18c\uc2a4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud559 \ucea0\ud37c\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud559\uc0dd\ub4e4\uc774 \uc218\uc5c5 \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \ube60\ub974\uace0 \ud3b8\ub9ac\ud558\uac8c \ube48 \uc8fc\ucc28 \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \ucc3e\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc13c\uc11c\ub97c \uc124\uce58\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0, \uc704\uce58 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc8fc\ucc28 \ud589\ub3d9\uacfc \ucc28\ub7c9 \uc774\ub3d9 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\ub294 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub79c\ub364 \ud3ec\ub808\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud68c\uadc0\uac00 \ucd5c\uc800 RMSE 0.142\uc640 \ucd5c\uace0 R2 0.582\ub97c \uae30\ub85d\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "LSTM \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ucd94\uac00 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \uae34 \uc2dc\uac04 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub85c \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc77c \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub3c4\uc2dc \uc778\uad6c\uac00 \uacc4\uc18d \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \ub3c4\uc2dc\ub294 \uc8fc\ucc28 \uad00\ub9ac \ubc0f \uc810\uc720\uc728 \uacb0\uc815\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4 \ub9ce\uc740 \ub3c4\uc804\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788 \ub300\ud559 \ucea0\ud37c\uc2a4\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud559\uc0dd\ub4e4\uc774 \uc218\uc5c5 \uc2dc\uac04 \ub3d9\uc548 \ube60\ub974\uace0 \ud3b8\ub9ac\ud558\uac8c \ube48 \uc8fc\ucc28 \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \ucc3e\uc544\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4. \ucea0\ud37c\uc2a4 \ub0b4 \uc8fc\ucc28 \uacf5\uac04\uc758 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uac00\uc6a9\uc131\uc740 \ube48 \uc8fc\ucc28 \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud560\ub2f9\ud558\ub294 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac70\ub9ac \uc9c0\ub3c4, \uc774\ub3d9\uc131 \ubc0f \uae30\uc0c1 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ub4f1 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc18c\uc2a4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc8fc\ucc28 \ud589\ub3d9\uacfc \ucc28\ub7c9 \uc774\ub3d9 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uc81c\uacf5\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uac70\ub9ac\ub098 \uc8fc\ucc28 \uad6c\uc5ed\uc5d0 \uc13c\uc11c \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uc124\uce58\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc5c6\uc73c\uba70, \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub294 \uc704\uce58 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc218\uc9d1\ub41c\ub2e4. \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc608\uc0c1 \uc8fc\ucc28 \uc9c4\uc785 \ubc0f \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud574 \uc801\uc808\ud55c \uc8fc\ucc28 \uad6c\uc5ed\uc744 \uc9c0\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc608\uce21 \ubaa8\ub378\uc778 \uc120\ud615 \ud68c\uadc0, \uc11c\ud3ec\ud2b8 \ubca1\ud130 \ud68c\uadc0(SVR), \ub79c\ub364 \ud3ec\ub808\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud68c\uadc0(RFR) \ubc0f \uc7a5\ub2e8\uae30 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac(LSTM)\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \ud29c\ub2dd\uc740 \uadf8\ub9ac\ub4dc \uac80\uc0c9\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc218\ud589\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \ubaa8\ub378 \uc131\ub2a5\uc740 \ud3c9\uade0 \uc81c\uacf1\uadfc \uc624\ucc28(RMSE), \ud3c9\uade0 \uc808\ub300 \uc624\ucc28(MAE) \ubc0f \uacb0\uc815 \uacc4\uc218(R2)\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud574 \ud3c9\uac00\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \ub79c\ub364 \ud3ec\ub808\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud68c\uadc0\ub294 0.142\uc758 \ucd5c\uc800 RMSE\uc640 0.582\uc758 \ucd5c\uace0 R2\ub97c \uae30\ub85d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4\uc801 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud560 \ub54c, \ucd94\uac00 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \ub354 \uae34 \uc2dc\uac04 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub85c LSTM \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4."}}

In this work, we\nfocus on optimizing SMA compositions to achieve a desired martensitic start\ntemperature (Ms) while minimizing cost. To do this, we use machine learning\nmodels as surrogate predictors and apply numerical optimization methods to\nsearch for suitable alloy combinations. We trained two types of machine\nlearning models, a tree-based ensemble and a neural network, using a dataset of\nexperimentally characterized alloys and physics-informed features. The\ntree-based model was used with a derivative-free optimizer (COBYLA), while the\nneural network, which provides gradient information, was paired with a\ngradient-based optimizer (TRUST-CONSTR). Our results show that while both\nmodels predict Ms with similar accuracy, the optimizer paired with the neural\nnetwork finds better solutions more consistently.

This obstacle arises from the way models\ninherently entangle domain-specific and label-relevant features, resulting in\nspurious correlations. While feature disentanglement aims to solve this,\ncurrent methods are largely unguided, lacking the semantic direction required\nto isolate truly universal features. To address this, we propose an end-to-end\nEnergy-Regularized Information for Shift-Robustness (\\textbf{ERIS}) framework\nto enable guided and reliable feature disentanglement. The core idea is that\neffective disentanglement requires not only mathematical constraints but also\nsemantic guidance to anchor the separation process. ERIS incorporates three key\nmechanisms to achieve this goal. Specifically, we first introduce an\nenergy-guided calibration mechanism, which provides crucial semantic guidance\nfor the separation, enabling the model to self-calibrate. Additionally, a\nweight-level orthogonality strategy enforces structural independence between\ndomain-specific and label-relevant features, thereby mitigating their\ninterference. Moreover, an auxiliary adversarial training mechanism enhances\nrobustness by injecting structured perturbations.

While various dynamic computation\nmethods have been developed to mitigate this by targeting spatial, temporal, or\narchitecture-specific redundancies, they remain fragmented. While the\nprinciples of adaptive computation time (ACT) offer a robust foundation for a\nunified approach, its application to SNN-based vision Transformers (ViTs) is\nhindered by two core issues: the violation of its temporal similarity\nprerequisite and a static architecture fundamentally unsuited for its\nprinciples. To address these challenges, we propose STAS (Spatio-Temporal\nAdaptive computation time for Spiking transformers), a framework that\nco-designs the static architecture and dynamic computation policy. STAS\nintroduces an integrated spike patch splitting (I-SPS) module to establish\ntemporal stability by creating a unified input representation, thereby solving\nthe architectural problem of temporal dissimilarity. This stability, in turn,\nallows our adaptive spiking self-attention (A-SSA) module to perform\ntwo-dimensional token pruning across both spatial and temporal axes.\nImplemented on spiking Transformer architectures and validated on CIFAR-10,\nCIFAR-100, and ImageNet, STAS reduces energy consumption by up to 45.9%, 43.8%,\nand 30.1%, respectively, while simultaneously improving accuracy over SOTA\nmodels.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc2a4\ud30c\uc774\ud0b9 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(SNNs)\uc758 \ub192\uc740 \ub300\uae30 \uc2dc\uac04\uacfc \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c \uc904\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud55c STAS(Spatio-Temporal Adaptive computation time for Spiking transformers)\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "SNNs\ub294 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc774 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub098\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub2e4\uc911 \ud0c0\uc784\uc2a4\ud15d \uc791\uc5c5 \ud2b9\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ub192\uc740 \ub300\uae30 \uc2dc\uac04\uacfc \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "STAS\ub294 \uc815\uc801 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc640 \ub3d9\uc801 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uacf5\ub3d9 \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uace0, \ud1b5\ud569 \uc2a4\ud30c\uc774\ud06c \ud328\uce58 \ubd84\ud560(I-SPS) \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ud655\ub9bd\ud558\uba70, A-SSA \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uacf5\uac04\uc801 \ubc0f \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \ucd95\uc744 \ub530\ub77c \ub450 \ucc28\uc6d0 \ud1a0\ud070 \ud504\ub8e8\ub2dd\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "STAS\ub294 CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet\uc5d0\uc11c \uac80\uc99d\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uac01\uac01 45.9%, 43.8%, 30.1%\uc758 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc18c\ube44\ub97c \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 SOTA \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf30\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 SNN \uae30\ubc18 \ube44\uc804 \ud2b8\ub79c\uc2a4\ud3ec\uba38\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc2a4\ud30c\uc774\ud0b9 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(SNNs)\uc740 \uc778\uacf5 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(ANNs)\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub2e4\uc911 \ud0c0\uc784\uc2a4\ud15d \uc6b4\uc601 \ud2b9\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ub192\uc740 \ub300\uae30 \uc2dc\uac04\uacfc \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub85c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uacf5\uac04\uc801, \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \ub610\ub294 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \ud2b9\ud654\uc801 \uc911\ubcf5\uc131\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub3d9\uc801 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uac1c\ubc1c\ub418\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ud30c\ud3b8\ud654\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc2dc\uac04(ACT)\uc758 \uc6d0\uce59\uc740 \ud1b5\ud569 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, SNN \uae30\ubc18 \ube44\uc804 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30(ViTs)\uc5d0\uc758 \uc801\uc6a9\uc740 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131 \uc804\uc81c\uc758 \uc704\ubc18\uacfc \uadf8 \uc6d0\uce59\uc5d0 \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd80\uc801\ud569\ud55c \uc815\uc801 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub77c\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud575\uc2ec \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc800\ud574\ub41c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 STAS(Spatio-Temporal Adaptive computation time for Spiking transformers)\ub77c\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc815\uc801 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc640 \ub3d9\uc801 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uacf5\ub3d9 \uc124\uacc4\ud55c\ub2e4.

These principles offer valuable\ninsights for artificial neural network (ANN) design, especially as networks\ngrow in depth and scale. Sparsity, in particular, has been widely explored for\nreducing memory and computation, improving speed, and enhancing generalization.\nMotivated by systems neuroscience findings, we explore how patterns of\nfunctional connectivity in the mouse visual cortex-specifically,\nensemble-to-ensemble communication, can inform ANN design. We introduce G2GNet,\na novel architecture that imposes sparse, modular connectivity across\nfeedforward layers. Despite having significantly fewer parameters than fully\nconnected models, G2GNet achieves superior accuracy on standard vision\nbenchmarks. To our knowledge, this is the first architecture to incorporate\nbiologically observed functional connectivity patterns as a structural bias in\nANN design.

Griffiths"], "title": "Amortized Bayesian Meta-Learning for Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models", "comment": "6 pages, 2 figures", "summary": "Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with low-rank adaptaion (LoRA) is a\ncost-effective way to incorporate information from a specific dataset. However,\nit is often unclear how well the fine-tuned LLM will generalize, i.e., how well\nit will perform on unseen datasets. Methods have been proposed to improve\ngeneralization by optimizing with in-context prompts, or by using meta-learning\nto fine-tune LLMs. However, these methods are expensive in memory and\ncomputation, requiring either long-context prompts or saving copies of\nparameters and using second-order gradient updates. To address these\nchallenges, we propose Amortized Bayesian Meta-Learning for LoRA (ABMLL). This\nmethod builds on amortized Bayesian meta-learning for smaller models, adapting\nthis approach to LLMs while maintaining its computational efficiency.

However, estimating the MFD for a given network\nrequires large numbers of loop detectors, which is not always available in\npractice. This article proposes a framework harnessing meta-learning, a\nsubcategory of machine learning that trains models to understand and adapt to\nnew tasks on their own, to alleviate the data scarcity challenge. The developed\nmodel is trained and tested by leveraging data from multiple cities and\nexploiting it to model the MFD of other cities with different shares of\ndetectors and topological structures. The proposed meta-learning framework is\napplied to an ad-hoc Multi-Task Physics-Informed Neural Network, specifically\ndesigned to estimate the MFD. Results show an average MSE improvement in flow\nprediction ranging between ~ 17500 and 36000 (depending on the subset of loop\ndetectors tested). The meta-learning framework thus successfully generalizes\nacross diverse urban settings and improves performance on cities with limited\ndata, demonstrating the potential of using meta-learning when a limited number\nof detectors is available.

In this\npaper, we introduce AIRL-S, the first natural unification of RL-based and\nsearch-based TTS. Central to AIRL-S is the insight that the reward function\nlearned during RL training inherently represents the ideal PRM for guiding\ndownstream search. Specifically, we leverage adversarial inverse reinforcement\nlearning (AIRL) combined with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) to\nlearn a dense, dynamic PRM directly from correct reasoning traces, entirely\neliminating the need for labeled intermediate process data. At inference, the\nresulting PRM simultaneously serves as the critic for RL rollouts and as a\nheuristic to effectively guide search procedures, facilitating robust reasoning\nchain extension, mitigating reward hacking, and enhancing cross-task\ngeneralization. Experimental results across eight benchmarks, including\nmathematics, scientific reasoning, and code generation, demonstrate that our\nunified approach improves performance by 9 % on average over the base model,\nmatching GPT-4o. Furthermore, when integrated into multiple search algorithms,\nour PRM consistently outperforms all baseline PRMs trained with labeled data.\nThese results underscore that, indeed, your reward function for RL is your best\nPRM for search, providing a robust and cost-effective solution to complex\nreasoning tasks in LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 RL \uae30\ubc18\uacfc \uac80\uc0c9 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 TTS\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c AIRL-S\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(TTS)\uc758 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1(TTS)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "AIRL-S\ub294 \uc5ed\uc801\ub300 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(AIRL)\uacfc \uadf8\ub8f9 \uc0c1\ub300 \uc815\ucc45 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654(GRPO)\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud574 \ub3d9\uc801 PRM\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc5ec\ub35f \uac1c\uc758 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3c9\uade0 9% \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \ud2b9\ud788 GPT-4o\uc640 \ub3d9\ub4f1\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 RL\uc758 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218\uac00 \uac80\uc0c9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ucd5c\uc0c1\uc758 PRM\uc784\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70, \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud558\uace0 \ube44\uc6a9 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs)\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1(TTS)\uc740 \uc9c0\uae08\uae4c\uc9c0 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud06c\uac8c \ubd84\ub9ac\ub41c \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ub258\uc5b4\uc838 \uc788\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4: (1) \ud76c\uc18c\ud55c \uc131\uacfc \uae30\ubc18 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL) \ubc29\ubc95, \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ubd88\uc548\uc815\uc131\uacfc \ub0ae\uc740 \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95; (2) \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \uc815\uc801 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubaa8\ub378(PRM)\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc548\ub0b4\ub418\ub294 \uac80\uc0c9 \uae30\ubc18 \uae30\uc220\ub85c, \uc774\ub294 \ube44\uc2fc \uc778\uac04 \ub610\ub294 LLM \uc0dd\uc131 \ub808\uc774\ube14\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\uba70 \uc885\uc885 \ubd84\ud3ec \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc800\ud558\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 RL \uae30\ubc18\uacfc \uac80\uc0c9 \uae30\ubc18 TTS\uc758 \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7ec\uc6b4 \ud1b5\ud569\uc778 AIRL-S\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

MAI systems\nencode inductive biases via structural reuse, minimizing entropy and enabling\ncontext-aware, structure-preserving inference. This approach reframes cognitive\nsystems not as ergodic samplers, but as navigators over constrained latent\nmanifolds, guided by persistent topological memory.

Our\nexperiments on a modified CIC-IDS2017 data set with synthetic noise demonstrate\nsignificant improvements in detection performance compared to the baseline\nTGN-SVDD model, especially as noise levels increase.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub178\uc774\uc988\uac00 \ud3ec\ud568\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc785\ub825\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 TGN-SVDD \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uce68\uc785 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc624\uc5fc\ub41c \ubc0f \ub178\uc774\uc988\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc785\ub825\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc785\ub825 \ub178\uc774\uc988\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 TGN-SVDD \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \ubc84\uc804\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc218\uc815\ub41c CIC-IDS2017 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c, \ud2b9\ud788 \ub178\uc774\uc988 \uc218\uc900\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c baseline TGN-SVDD \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ud06c\uac8c \uac1c\uc120\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ub178\uc774\uc988 \uc788\ub294 \uc801\ub300\uc801\uc778 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7fd\uac8c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uba70 baseline \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uce68\uc785 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc624\uc5fc\ub41c \ubc0f \ub178\uc774\uc988\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc785\ub825\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uacfc\uc81c\ub85c \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc785\ub825 \ub178\uc774\uc988\uc758 \uc874\uc7ac\uc5d0\uc11c \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c Temporal Graph Network Support Vector Data Description (TGN-SVDD) \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \ubc84\uc804\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uac01 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac00\uc6b0\uc2dc\uc548 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc758 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uc608\uce21\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ub178\uc774\uc988\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \uc801\ub300\uc801 \uc0ac\ub840\ub97c \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7fd\uac8c \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uace0, \uae30\uc900 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uac15\uac74\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \ud569\uc131 \ub178\uc774\uc988\uac00 \ud3ec\ud568\ub41c \uc218\uc815\ub41c CIC-IDS2017 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c, \ud2b9\ud788 \ub178\uc774\uc988 \uc218\uc900\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud560\uc218\ub85d \uae30\uc900 TGN-SVDD \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \ud06c\uac8c \uac1c\uc120\ub428\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\ub2e4."}}

We introduce\nOrgan-Agents, a multi-agent framework that simulates human physiology via\nLLM-driven agents. Each Simulator models a specific system (e.g.,\ncardiovascular, renal, immune). Training consists of supervised fine-tuning on\nsystem-specific time-series data, followed by reinforcement-guided coordination\nusing dynamic reference selection and error correction. We curated data from\n7,134 sepsis patients and 7,895 controls, generating high-resolution\ntrajectories across 9 systems and 125 variables. Organ-Agents achieved high\nsimulation accuracy on 4,509 held-out patients, with per-system MSEs <0.16 and\nrobustness across SOFA-based severity strata. External validation on 22,689 ICU\npatients from two hospitals showed moderate degradation under distribution\nshifts with stable simulation. Organ-Agents faithfully reproduces critical\nmulti-system events (e.g., hypotension, hyperlactatemia, hypoxemia) with\ncoherent timing and phase progression. Evaluation by 15 critical care\nphysicians confirmed realism and physiological plausibility (mean Likert\nratings 3.9 and 3.7).

However, the exact\ncomputation of Shapley values scales exponentially with the number of features,\nseverely limiting the practical application of this powerful approach. The\nchallenge is further compounded when the predictive model is probabilistic - as\nin Gaussian processes (GPs) - where the outputs are random variables rather\nthan point estimates, necessitating additional computational effort in modeling\nhigher-order moments. In this work, we demonstrate that for an important class\nof GPs known as FANOVA GP, which explicitly models all main effects and\ninteractions, *exact* Shapley attributions for both local and global\nexplanations can be computed in *quadratic time*. For local, instance-wise\nexplanations, we define a stochastic cooperative game over function components\nand compute the exact stochastic Shapley value in quadratic time only,\ncapturing both the expected contribution and uncertainty. For global\nexplanations, we introduce a deterministic, variance-based value function and\ncompute exact Shapley values that quantify each feature's contribution to the\nmodel's overall sensitivity. Our methods leverage a closed-form (stochastic)\nM\\\"{o}bius representation of the FANOVA decomposition and introduce recursive\nalgorithms, inspired by Newton's identities, to efficiently compute the mean\nand variance of Shapley values.

Standard function approximators, such as multi-layer\nperceptrons, may struggle to efficiently represent the complex value landscapes\ninherent in many reinforcement learning problems. This paper introduces a novel\narchitecture, the Chebyshev-DQN (Ch-DQN), which integrates a Chebyshev\npolynomial basis into the DQN framework to create a more effective feature\nrepresentation. By leveraging the powerful function approximation properties of\nChebyshev polynomials, we hypothesize that the Ch-DQN can learn more\nefficiently and achieve higher performance. We evaluate our proposed model on\nthe CartPole-v1 benchmark and compare it against a standard DQN with a\ncomparable number of parameters. Our results demonstrate that the Ch-DQN with a\nmoderate polynomial degree (N=4) achieves significantly better asymptotic\nperformance, outperforming the baseline by approximately 39\\%. However, we also\nfind that the choice of polynomial degree is a critical hyperparameter, as a\nhigh degree (N=8) can be detrimental to learning.

LLM inference is an online and multi-task\nservice process and also heavily energy consuming by which a pre-trained LLM\nprocesses input requests and generates output tokens sequentially. Therefore,\nit is vital to improve its scheduling efficiency and reduce the power\nconsumption while a great amount of prompt requests are arriving. A key\nchallenge in LLM inference scheduling is that while the prompt length is known\nupon arrival, the output length, which critically impacts memory usage and\nprocessing time, is unknown. To address this uncertainty, we propose algorithms\nthat leverage machine learning to predict output lengths, assuming the\nprediction provides an interval classification (min-max range) for each\nrequest.\n  We first design a conservative algorithm, $\\mathcal{A}_{\\max}$, which\nschedules requests based on the upper bound of predicted output lengths to\nprevent memory overflow. However, this approach is overly conservative: as\nprediction accuracy decreases, performance degrades significantly due to\npotential overestimation. To overcome this limitation, we propose\n$\\mathcal{A}_{\\min}$, an adaptive algorithm that initially treats the predicted\nlower bound as the output length and dynamically refines this estimate during\ninferencing. We prove that $\\mathcal{A}_{\\min}$ achieves a log-scale\ncompetitive ratio. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that\n$\\mathcal{A}_{\\min}$ often performs nearly as well as the hindsight scheduler,\nhighlighting both its efficiency and robustness in practical scenarios.\nMoreover, $\\mathcal{A}_{\\min}$ relies solely on the lower bound of the\nprediction interval--an advantageous design choice since upper bounds on output\nlength are typically more challenging to predict accurately.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \ucd94\ub860 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\ub9c1\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ucd1d \ub300\uae30 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub0b4\uc6a9\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8ec\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubcf4\uc218\uc801\uc778 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95($\\mathcal{A}_{\\max}$)\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud55c \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998($\\mathcal{A}_{\\min}$)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc608\uce21\ub41c \ud558\ud55c\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\uc815\uce58\ub97c \uc870\uc815\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uacac\uace0\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc778\ub2e4. \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc790\uc8fc \ud6c4\ud589 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\ub7ec\uc640 \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \ucd94\ub860 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\ub9c1 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0 \uc804\ub825 \uc18c\ube44\ub97c \uc904\uc774\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ucd9c\ub825 \uae38\uc774\ub97c \uc608\uce21\ud558\uace0, \ubcf4\uc218\uc801\uc778 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998($\\mathcal{A}_{\\max}$)\uacfc \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998($\\mathcal{A}_{\\min}$)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998($\\mathcal{A}_{\\min}$)\uc740 \ud6c4\ud589 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\ub7ec\uc640 \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uba74\uc11c \ub85c\uadf8 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c \uacbd\uc7c1 \ube44\uc728\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc608\uce21\ub41c \ud558\ud55c\uc5d0\ub9cc \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294 \uc124\uacc4 \uc120\ud0dd\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd9c\ub825 \uae38\uc774\uc758 \uc0c1\ud55c\uc744 \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \uc608\uce21\ud558\uae30 \ub354 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ucd1d \ub300\uae30 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \ucd94\ub860 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\ub9c1 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4.

This work introduces\nFedRAIN-Lite, a federated reinforcement learning (FedRL) framework that mirrors\nthe spatial decomposition used in general circulation models (GCMs) by\nassigning agents to latitude bands, enabling local parameter learning with\nperiodic global aggregation. Using a hierarchy of simplified energy-balance\nclimate models, from a single-agent baseline (ebm-v1) to multi-agent ensemble\n(ebm-v2) and GCM-like (ebm-v3) setups, we benchmark three RL algorithms under\ndifferent FedRL configurations. Results show that Deep Deterministic Policy\nGradient (DDPG) consistently outperforms both static and single-agent\nbaselines, with faster convergence and lower area-weighted RMSE in tropical and\nmid-latitude zones across both ebm-v2 and ebm-v3 setups. DDPG's ability to\ntransfer across hyperparameters and low computational cost make it well-suited\nfor geographically adaptive parameter learning. This capability offers a\nscalable pathway towards high-complexity GCMs and provides a prototype for\nphysically aligned, online-learning climate models that can evolve with a\nchanging climate.

In contrast to\ntheir vast potential, training them on large-scale graphs presents significant\ncomputational challenges due to the resources required for their storage and\nprocessing. Graph Condensation has emerged as a promising solution to reduce\nthese demands by learning a synthetic compact graph that preserves the\nessential information of the original one while maintaining the GNN's\npredictive performance. Despite their efficacy, current graph condensation\napproaches frequently rely on a computationally intensive bi-level\noptimization. Moreover, they fail to maintain a mapping between synthetic and\noriginal nodes, limiting the interpretability of the model's decisions. In this\nsense, a wide range of decomposition techniques have been applied to learn\nlinear or multi-linear functions from graph data, offering a more transparent\nand less resource-intensive alternative. However, their applicability to graph\ncondensation remains unexplored. This paper addresses this gap and proposes a\nnovel method called Multi-view Graph Condensation via Tensor Decomposition\n(GCTD) to investigate to what extent such techniques can synthesize an\ninformative smaller graph and achieve comparable downstream task performance.\nExtensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that GCTD\neffectively reduces graph size while preserving GNN performance, achieving up\nto a 4.0\\ improvement in accuracy on three out of six datasets and competitive\nperformance on large graphs compared to existing approaches.

While numerous methods have\nbeen proposed for AFA, ranging from greedy information-theoretic strategies to\nnon-myopic reinforcement learning approaches, fair and systematic evaluation of\nthese methods has been hindered by the lack of standardized benchmarks. In this\npaper, we introduce AFABench, the first benchmark framework for AFA. Our\nbenchmark includes a diverse set of synthetic and real-world datasets, supports\na wide range of acquisition policies, and provides a modular design that\nenables easy integration of new methods and tasks. We implement and evaluate\nrepresentative algorithms from all major categories, including static, greedy,\nand reinforcement learning-based approaches.

Researchers have pinned their hopes on data-driven\nmethods to regress such ranging errors from raw measurements. However, the\ngrueling annotation of ranging errors impedes their pace. This paper presents a\nrobust end-to-end Neural Ranging Correction (NeRC) framework, where\nlocalization-related metrics serve as the task objective for training the\nneural modules. Instead of seeking impractical ranging error labels, we train\nthe neural network using ground-truth locations that are relatively easy to\nobtain. This functionality is supported by differentiable moving horizon\nlocation estimation (MHE) that handles a horizon of measurements for\npositioning and backpropagates the gradients for training. Even better, as a\nblessing of end-to-end learning, we propose a new training paradigm using\nEuclidean Distance Field (EDF) cost maps, which alleviates the demands on\nlabeled locations. We evaluate the proposed NeRC on public benchmarks and our\ncollected datasets, demonstrating its distinguished improvement in positioning\naccuracy.

They inject conditioning signals at the start\nof the training process and require retraining a new model from scratch\nwhenever the constraint changes. However, real-world applications often involve\nmultiple constraints across different modalities, and additional constraints\nmay emerge over the course of a study. This raises a challenge: how to extend a\npre-trained diffusion model not only to support cross-modality constraints but\nalso to incorporate new ones without retraining. To tackle this problem, we\npropose the Cross-Modality Controlled Molecule Generation with Diffusion\nLanguage Model (CMCM-DLM), demonstrated by two distinct cross modalities:\nmolecular structure and chemical properties. Our approach builds upon a\npre-trained diffusion model, incorporating two trainable modules, the Structure\nControl Module (SCM) and the Property Control Module (PCM), and operates in two\ndistinct phases during the generation process. In Phase I, we employs the SCM\nto inject structural constraints during the early diffusion steps, effectively\nanchoring the molecular backbone. Phase II builds on this by further\nintroducing PCM to guide the later stages of inference to refine the generated\nmolecules, ensuring their chemical properties match the specified targets.\nExperimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the efficiency and\nadaptability of our approach, highlighting CMCM-DLM's significant advancement\nin molecular generation for drug discovery applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubd84\uc790 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc778 CMCM-DLM\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud604\uc7ac\uc758 SMILES \uae30\ubc18 \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ub2e8\uc77c \ubaa8\ub4dc \uc81c\uc57d\ub9cc\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uba70, \uc81c\uc57d\uc774 \ubcc0\uacbd\ub420 \ub54c\ub9c8\ub2e4 \uc0c8\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294 \ubd88\ud3b8\ud568\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc751\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubaa8\ub4dc\uc758 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc81c\uc57d\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "Cross-Modality Controlled Molecule Generation with Diffusion Language Model (CMCM-DLM)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc0ac\uc804 \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc778 \uad6c\uc870 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub4c8(SCM)\uacfc \ud2b9\uc131 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub4c8(PCM)\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc791\ub3d9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc5ec\ub7ec \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc774 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc801\uc751 \uac00\ub2a5\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, CMCM-DLM\uc774 \uc57d\ubb3c \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ubd84\uc790 \uc0dd\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc9c4\uc804\uc744 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5c8\uc74c\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "CMCM-DLM\uc740 \uc81c\uc57d \ubcc0\uacbd \uc5c6\uc774 \ubaa8\ub4dc \uac04 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \ubd84\uc790 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc5f4\uc5b4\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud604\uc7ac SMILES \uae30\ubc18 \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ubd84\uc790 \uc0dd\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e8\uc77c \ubaa8\ub4dc \uc81c\uc57d\ub9cc\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub4e4\uc740 \ud6c8\ub828 \uacfc\uc815\uc758 \uc2dc\uc791\uc5d0\uc11c \uc870\uac74 \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \uc8fc\uc785\ud558\uace0 \uc81c\uc57d\uc774 \ubcc0\uacbd\ub420 \ub54c\ub9c8\ub2e4 \uc0c8\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ucc98\uc74c\ubd80\ud130 \ud559\uc2b5\ud574\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc751\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubaa8\ub4dc\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc81c\uc57d\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc5f0\uad6c \uc9c4\ud589 \uc911\uc5d0 \ucd94\uac00 \uc81c\uc57d\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uc81c\uae30\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uc5ec \uad50\ucc28 \ubaa8\ub4dc \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uace0, \uc7ac\ud6c8\ub828 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc744\uae4c\uc694?

Existing theoretical studies on the\nlearning dynamics of GNNs primarily focus on the convergence rates of learning\nalgorithms under the interpolation regime (noise-free) and offer only a crude\nconnection between these dynamics and the actual graph structure (e.g., maximum\ndegree). This paper aims to bridge this gap by investigating the excessive risk\n(generalization performance) of learning algorithms in GNNs within the\ngeneralization regime (with noise). Specifically, we extend the conventional\nsettings from the learning theory literature to the context of GNNs and examine\nhow graph structure influences the performance of learning algorithms such as\nstochastic gradient descent (SGD) and Ridge regression. Our study makes several\nkey contributions toward understanding the interplay between graph structure\nand learning in GNNs. First, we derive the excess risk profiles of SGD and\nRidge regression in GNNs and connect these profiles to the graph structure\nthrough spectral graph theory. With this established framework, we further\nexplore how different graph structures (regular vs. power-law) impact the\nperformance of these algorithms through comparative analysis. Additionally, we\nextend our analysis to multi-layer linear GNNs, revealing an increasing\nnon-isotropic effect on the excess risk profile, thereby offering new insights\ninto the over-smoothing issue in GNNs from the perspective of learning\nalgorithms. Our empirical results align with our theoretical predictions,\n\\emph{collectively showcasing a coupling relation among graph structure, GNNs\nand learning algorithms, and providing insights on GNN algorithm design and\nselection in practice.}", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(GNNs)\uc5d0\uc11c \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uacfc

To address these challenges, we\nintroduce PepThink-R1, a generative framework that integrates large language\nmodels (LLMs) with chain-of-thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning and\nreinforcement learning (RL). Unlike prior approaches, PepThink-R1 explicitly\nreasons about monomer-level modifications during sequence generation, enabling\ninterpretable design choices while optimizing for multiple pharmacological\nproperties. Guided by a tailored reward function balancing chemical validity\nand property improvements, the model autonomously explores diverse sequence\nvariants. We demonstrate that PepThink-R1 generates cyclic peptides with\nsignificantly enhanced lipophilicity, stability, and exposure, outperforming\nexisting general LLMs (e.g., GPT-5) and domain-specific baseline in both\noptimization success and interpretability.

However, their\ntheoretical behavior, particularly regarding convergence, remains\nunderexplored. Unlike common score-based generative models (SGMs), which are\ngoverned by a single stochastic differential equation (SDE), SGGMs involve a\nsystem of coupled SDEs. In SGGMs, the graph structure and node features are\ngoverned by separate but interdependent SDEs. This distinction makes existing\nconvergence analyses from SGMs inapplicable for SGGMs. In this work, we present\nthe first non-asymptotic convergence analysis for SGGMs, focusing on the\nconvergence bound (the risk of generative error) across three key graph\ngeneration paradigms: (1) feature generation with a fixed graph structure, (2)\ngraph structure generation with fixed node features, and (3) joint generation\nof both graph structure and node features. Our analysis reveals several unique\nfactors specific to SGGMs (e.g., the topological properties of the graph\nstructure) which affect the convergence bound. Additionally, we offer\ntheoretical insights into the selection of hyperparameters (e.g., sampling\nsteps and diffusion length) and advocate for techniques like normalization to\nimprove convergence. To validate our theoretical findings, we conduct a\ncontrolled empirical study using synthetic graph models, and the results align\nwith our theoretical predictions.

However, their broader adoption faces\nchallenges in \\emph{scalability and size generalization}. GDGMs struggle to\nscale to large graphs due to their high memory requirements, as they typically\noperate in the full graph space, requiring the entire graph to be stored in\nmemory during training and inference. This constraint limits their feasibility\nfor large-scale real-world graphs. GDGMs also exhibit poor size generalization,\nwith limited ability to generate graphs of sizes different from those in the\ntraining data, restricting their adaptability across diverse applications. To\naddress these challenges, we propose the stochastic block graph diffusion\n(SBGD) model, which refines graph representations into a block graph space.\nThis space incorporates structural priors based on real-world graph patterns,\nsignificantly reducing memory complexity and enabling scalability to large\ngraphs. The block representation also improves size generalization by capturing\nfundamental graph structures. Empirical results show that SBGD achieves\nsignificant memory improvements (up to 6$\\times$) while maintaining comparable\nor even superior graph generation performance relative to state-of-the-art\nmethods. Furthermore, experiments demonstrate that SBGD better generalizes to\nunseen graph sizes.

We evaluate the framework via\none-step-ahead predictive validation and by assessing the plausibility and\nimpact of interventions. Evaluation showed reasonable predictive accuracy\n(e.g., mean heart rate MAE 4.71 bpm) and high counterfactual plausibility\n(median 0.9643).

DuPO addresses\ntwo key limitations: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)'s\nreliance on costly labels and applicability restricted to verifiable tasks, and\ntraditional dual learning's restriction to strictly dual task pairs (e.g.,\ntranslation and back-translation). Specifically, DuPO decomposes a primal\ntask's input into known and unknown components, then constructs its dual task\nto reconstruct the unknown part using the primal output and known information\n(e.g., reversing math solutions to recover hidden variables), broadening\napplicability to non-invertible tasks. The quality of this reconstruction\nserves as a self-supervised reward to optimize the primal task, synergizing\nwith LLMs' ability to instantiate both tasks via a single model. Empirically,\nDuPO achieves substantial gains across diverse tasks: it enhances the average\ntranslation quality by 2.13 COMET over 756 directions, boosts the mathematical\nreasoning accuracy by an average of 6.4 points on three challenge benchmarks,\nand enhances performance by 9.3 points as an inference-time reranker (trading\ncomputation for accuracy).

Several\nbenchmarks have been proposed to compare the performance of SR algorithms.\nHowever, existing ground-truth rediscovery benchmarks overemphasize the\nrecovery of \"the one\" expression form or rely solely on computer algebra\nsystems (such as SymPy) to assess success. Furthermore, existing benchmarks\ncontinue the expression search even after its discovery. We improve upon these\nissues by introducing curated lists of acceptable expressions, and a callback\nmechanism for early termination.

Path attribution methods such as Integrated\nGradients rely on a baseline input representing the absence of relevant\nfeatures (\"missingness\"). Commonly used baselines, such as all-zero inputs, are\noften semantically meaningless, especially in medical contexts where\nmissingness can itself be informative. While alternative baseline choices have\nbeen explored, existing methods lack a principled approach to dynamically\nselect baselines tailored to each input. In this work, we examine the notion of\nmissingness in the medical setting, analyze its implications for baseline\nselection, and introduce a counterfactual-guided approach to address the\nlimitations of conventional baselines. We argue that a clinically normal but\ninput-close counterfactual represents a more accurate representation of a\nmeaningful absence of features in medical data. To implement this, we use a\nVariational Autoencoder to generate counterfactual baselines, though our\nconcept is generative-model-agnostic and can be applied with any suitable\ncounterfactual method.

The method first employs an improved Transformer\nmodule to perform temporal modeling on high-dimensional monitoring data, using\na self-attention mechanism to capture long-range dependencies and contextual\nsemantics. Then, a multiscale feature construction path is introduced to\nextract temporal features at different granularities through downsampling and\nparallel encoding. An attention-weighted fusion module is designed to\ndynamically adjust the contribution of each scale to the final decision,\nenhancing the model's robustness in anomaly pattern modeling. In the input\nmodeling stage, standardized multidimensional time series are constructed,\ncovering core signals such as CPU utilization, memory usage, and task\nscheduling states, while positional encoding is used to strengthen the model's\ntemporal awareness. A systematic experimental setup is designed to evaluate\nperformance, including comparative experiments and hyperparameter sensitivity\nanalysis, focusing on the impact of optimizers, learning rates, anomaly ratios,\nand noise levels. Experimental results show that the proposed method\noutperforms mainstream baseline models in key metrics, including precision,\nrecall, AUC, and F1-score, and maintains strong stability and detection\nperformance under various perturbation conditions, demonstrating its superior\ncapability in complex cloud environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud074\ub77c\uc6b0\ub4dc

Even though most traffic\naccident fatalities account to bicycles, they have received little attention,\nas previous work focused mainly on pedestrians and motorized vehicles. In this\nwork, we present the Great GATsBi, a domain-knowledge-based, hybrid, multimodal\ntrajectory prediction framework for bicycles. The model incorporates both\nphysics-based modeling (inspired by motorized vehicles) and social-based\nmodeling (inspired by pedestrian movements) to explicitly account for the dual\nnature of bicycle movement. The social interactions are modeled with a graph\nattention network, and include decayed historical, but also anticipated, future\ntrajectory data of a bicycles neighborhood, following recent insights from\npsychological and social studies. The results indicate that the proposed\nensemble of physics models -- performing well in the short-term predictions --\nand social models -- performing well in the long-term predictions -- exceeds\nstate-of-the-art performance. We also conducted a controlled mass-cycling\nexperiment to demonstrate the framework's performance when forecasting bicycle\ntrajectories and modeling social interactions with road users.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub3c4\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc6c0\uc9c1\uc784\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc608\uce21\uc774 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\uba70, \uc790\uc804\uac70\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad00\uc2ec\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc790\uc804\uac70\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \ub2e4\uc911\ubaa8\ub2ec \uada4\uc801 \uc608\uce21 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Great GATsBi\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc815\ud655\ud55c \ub3c4\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc6c0\uc9c1\uc784 \uc608\uce21\uc740 \ucca8\ub2e8 \uc6b4\uc804 \ubcf4\uc870 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uacfc \uc790\uc728\uc8fc\ud589 \ub4f1 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc751\uc6a9 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc694\uad6c\ub418\uba70, \ub3c4\ub85c \uc548\uc804\uc5d0 \ud2b9\ud788 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubb3c\ub9ac \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uacfc \uc0ac\ud68c \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \ub2e4\uc911\ubaa8\ub2ec \uada4\uc801 \uc608\uce21 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Great GATsBi\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc8fc\uc758 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubb3c\ub9ac \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \uc0ac\ud68c \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc559\uc0c1\ube14\uc774 \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uae30\uc220\uc744 \ucd08\uc6d4\ud558\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc790\uc804\uac70 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc790\uc804\uac70 \uada4\uc801 \uc608\uce21 \ubc0f \ub3c4\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc640\uc758 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc5d0\uc11c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud588\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub3c4\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc6c0\uc9c1\uc784\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc608\uce21\uc740 \ucca8\ub2e8 \uc6b4\uc804 \ubcf4\uc870 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\ubd80\ud130 \uc790\uc728\uc8fc\ud589\uc5d0 \uc774\ub974\uae30\uae4c\uc9c0 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc751\uc6a9 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uba70, \ud2b9\ud788 \ub3c4\ub85c \uc548\uc804\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \uad50\ud1b5\uc0ac\uace0 \uc0ac\ub9dd\uc790\ub294 \uc790\uc804\uac70\uc5d0 \ud574\ub2f9\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\uc804 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc8fc\ub85c \ubcf4\ud589\uc790 \ubc0f \ubaa8\ud130\ud654\ub41c \ucc28\ub7c9\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\ud574 \uc654\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc790\uc804\uac70\ub294 \uac70\uc758 \uc8fc\ubaa9\ubc1b\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc790\uc804\uac70\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \ub2e4\uc911\ubaa8\ub2ec \uada4\uc801 \uc608\uce21 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 Great GATsBi\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc790\uc804\uac70 \uc6c0\uc9c1\uc784\uc758 \uc774\uc911\uc801 \uc131\uaca9\uc744 \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc124\uba85\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubaa8\ud130\ud654\ub41c \ucc28\ub7c9\uc5d0\uc11c \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc740 \ubb3c\ub9ac \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uacfc \ubcf4\ud589\uc790 \uc6c0\uc9c1\uc784\uc5d0\uc11c \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc740 \uc0ac\ud68c \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc740 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc8fc\uc758 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ub418\uba70, \uc2ec\ub9ac\ud559 \ubc0f \uc0ac\ud68c \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ucd5c\uadfc \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uc790\uc804\uac70 \uc774\uc6c3\uc758 \uc774\ub825 \uada4\uc801 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubc0f \uc608\uc0c1\ub418\ub294 \ubbf8\ub798 \uada4\uc801 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ub2e8\uae30 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0\uc11c \uc798 \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\ub294 \ubb3c\ub9ac \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc559\uc0c1\ube14\uacfc \uc7a5\uae30 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0\uc11c \uc798 \uc791\ub3d9\ud558\ub294 \uc0ac\ud68c \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uae30\uc220\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud568\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uc790\uc804\uac70 \uada4\uc801 \uc608\uce21 \ubc0f \ub3c4\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc640\uc758 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc5d0\uc11c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud1b5\uc81c\ub41c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc790\uc804\uac70 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Data heterogeneity is a fundamental challenge in FL, which can result in\npoor convergence and performance degradation. Client drift has been recognized\nas one of the factors contributing to this issue resulting from the multiple\nlocal updates in FedAvg. However, in cross-device FL, a different form of drift\narises due to the partial client participation, but it has not been studied\nwell. This drift, we referred as period drift, occurs as participating clients\nat each communication round may exhibit distinct data distribution that\ndeviates from that of all clients. It could be more harmful than client drift\nsince the optimization objective shifts with every round.\n  In this paper, we investigate the interaction between period drift and client\ndrift, finding that period drift can have a particularly detrimental effect on\ncross-device FL as the degree of data heterogeneity increases. To tackle these\nissues, we propose a predict-observe framework and present an instantiated\nmethod, FedEve, where these two types of drift can compensate each other to\nmitigate their overall impact. We provide theoretical evidence that our\napproach can reduce the variance of model updates. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our method outperforms alternatives on non-iid data in\ncross-device settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uad50\ucc28 \uc7a5\uce58

However, the increasing adoption of behind-the-meter energy\nsources, such as solar panels and battery storage, poses new challenges for\nconventional NILM methods that rely solely on at-the-meter data. The injected\nenergy from the behind-the-meter sources can obscure the power signatures of\nindividual appliances, leading to a significant decline in NILM performance. To\naddress this challenge, we present DualNILM, a deep multi-task learning\nframework designed for the dual tasks of appliance state recognition and\ninjected energy identification in NILM. By integrating sequence-to-point and\nsequence-to-sequence strategies within a Transformer-based architecture,\nDualNILM can effectively capture multi-scale temporal dependencies in the\naggregate power consumption patterns, allowing for accurate appliance state\nrecognition and energy injection identification. We conduct validation of\nDualNILM using both self-collected and synthesized open NILM datasets that\ninclude both appliance-level energy consumption and energy injection. Extensive\nexperimental results demonstrate that DualNILM maintains an excellent\nperformance for the dual tasks in NILM, much outperforming conventional\nmethods.", "AI": {"tldr": "DualNILM\uc740 \ube44\uce68\uc785\ud615 \ubd80\ud558 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1(NILM)\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uae30 \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc778\uc2dd\uacfc \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc785 \uc2dd\ubcc4\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc2ec\uce35 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \ud648 \ubc0f \uac74\ubb3c \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc138\ubd80\uc801\uc778 \uae30\uae30 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc18c\ube44\ub97c \ud68d\ub4dd\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ube44\uce68\uc785\ud615 \ubd80\ud558 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1(NILM)\uc774 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc774 \ucc44\ud0dd\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubc1c\uc804\uae30 \ubc0f \ubc30\ud130\ub9ac \uc800\uc7a5\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ubbf8\ud130 \ub4a4 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc6d0\uc758 \uc0ac\uc6a9 \uc99d\uac00\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uae30\uc874 NILM \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "method": "DualNILM\uc740 Transformer \uae30\ubc18 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4-\ud22c-\ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8 \ubc0f \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4-\ud22c-\uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\uae30 \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc778\uc2dd\uacfc \uc8fc\uc785\ub41c \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc2dd\ubcc4\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc774\uc911 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc790\uccb4 \uc218\uc9d1\ub41c NILM \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uacfc \ud569\uc131\ub41c \uacf5\uac1c NILM \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec DualNILM\uc758 \uc720\ud6a8\uc131\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uc600\uace0, \uae30\uae30 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc18c\ube44\uc640 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc785\uc774 \ud3ec\ud568\ub410\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\uc5d0 \ub530\ub974\uba74, DualNILM\uc740 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ube44\uce68\uc785\ud615 \ubd80\ud558 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1(NILM)\uc740 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \ud648 \ubc0f \uac74\ubb3c \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc138\ubd80\uc801\uc778 \uae30\uae30 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc18c\ube44\ub97c \ud68d\ub4dd\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc81c\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ud0dc\uc591\uad11 \ud328\ub110 \ubc0f \ubc30\ud130\ub9ac \uc800\uc7a5\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ubbf8\ud130 \ub4a4 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc6d0\uc758 \ucc44\ud0dd\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 NILM \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub3c4\uc804\uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ub098\ud0c0\ub098\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubbf8\ud130 \ub4a4\uc758 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc785\uc740 \uac1c\ubcc4 \uae30\uae30\uc758 \uc804\ub825 \uc11c\uba85\uc744 \uac00\ub9b4 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 NILM \uc131\ub2a5\uc758 \ud604\uc800\ud55c \uac10\uc18c\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc9d1\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubd80\ud558 \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc778\uc2dd\uacfc \uc8fc\uc785 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc2dd\ubcc4\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc2ec\uce35 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 DualNILM\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Classical metric-based models of\nsimilarity choice assume independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA), a\nproperty that allows for a simpler formulation. While IIA violations have been\ndetected in many discrete choice settings, the similarity choice setting has\nreceived scant attention. This is because the target-dependent nature of the\nchoice complicates IIA testing. We propose two statistical methods to test for\nIIA: a classical goodness-of-fit test and a Bayesian counterpart based on the\nframework of Posterior Predictive Checks (PPC). This Bayesian approach, our\nmain technical contribution, quantifies the degree of IIA violation beyond its\nmere significance. We curate two datasets: one with choice sets designed to\nelicit IIA violations, and another with randomly generated choice sets from the\nsame item universe. Our tests confirmed significant IIA violations on both\ndatasets, and notably, we find a comparable degree of violation between them.\nFurther, we devise a new PPC test for population homogeneity. Results show that\nthe population is indeed homogenous, suggesting that the IIA violations are\ndriven by context effects -- specifically, interactions within the choice sets.\nThese results highlight the need for new similarity choice models that account\nfor such context effects.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc720\uc0ac\uc131 \uc120\ud0dd \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub294 \uc778\uac04\uc774 \ub300\uc548 \uac04\uc758 \uc120\ud0dd\uc744 \ud560 \ub54c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uba70, \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc778 \uad00\ub828 \ub300\uc548\uc758 \uac00\uc815(IIA)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac80\uc99d \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0 IIA \uc704\ubc18\uc774 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc720\uc0ac\uc131 \uc120\ud0dd \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c IIA \uc704\ubc18\uc774 \ub110\ub9ac \uc5f0\uad6c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0, \uc774\ub97c \uac80\uc99d\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\uace0\uc804\uc801\uc778 \uc801\ud569\ub3c4 \uac80\uc815\uacfc \ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec IIA\ub97c \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ud558\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub450 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\uc758\ubbf8\ud55c IIA \uc704\ubc18\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \ub450 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b \uac04\uc5d0 \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uc815\ub3c4\uc758 \uc704\ubc18\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc120\ud0dd \uc9d1\ud569 \ub0b4 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ub9e5\ub77d \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \ubc18\uc601\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131 \uc120\ud0dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc720\uc0ac\uc131 \uc120\ud0dd \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub294 \uc778\uac04\uc774 \ub300\uc548 \uac04\uc758 \uc120\ud0dd\uc744 \ud560 \ub54c \ub300\uc0c1\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc720\uc0ac\uc131\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uace0\uc804\uc801\uc778 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad \uae30\ubc18 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131 \uc120\ud0dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801 \uad00\ub828 \ub300\uc548(IIA)\uc758 \uac00\uc815\uc744 \ud558\uba70, \uc774 \uc18d\uc131\uc740 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \uc218\uc2dd\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9ce\uc740 \uc774\uc0b0 \uc120\ud0dd \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c IIA\uc758 \uc704\ubc18\uc774 \ubc1c\uacac\ub418\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc720\uc0ac\uc131 \uc120\ud0dd \uc124\uc815\uc740 \uac70\uc758 \uc8fc\ubaa9\ubc1b\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc120\ud0dd\uc758 \ub300\uc0c1 \uc758\uc874\uc801 \uc131\uc9c8\uc774 IIA \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud558\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4e4\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uace0\uc804\uc801\uc778 \uc801\ud569\ub3c4 \uac80\uc815\uacfc \ud6c4\ubc29 \uc608\uce21 \uac80\uc99d(PPC) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \ub300\uc751\uccb4\ub77c\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 IIA \uc704\ubc18\uc758 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \uc720\uc758\uc131\uc744 \ub118\uc5b4 \uadf8 \uc815\ub3c4\ub97c \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 IIA \uc704\ubc18\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \uc120\ud0dd \uc9d1\ud569\uacfc \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \ud56d\ubaa9 \uc6b0\uc8fc\uc5d0\uc11c \uc784\uc758\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \uc120\ud0dd \uc9d1\ud569 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \ub9c8\ub828\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub294 \ub450 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\uc758\ubbf8\ud55c IIA \uc704\ubc18\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud558\uc600\uace0, \ud2b9\ud788 \ub450 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b \uac04\uc5d0 \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uc815\ub3c4\uc758 \uc704\ubc18\uc774 \ubc1c\uacac\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc9d1\ub2e8 \ub3d9\uc9c8\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 PPC \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \uace0\uc548\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc778\uad6c\uac00 \uc2e4\uc81c\ub85c \ub3d9\uc9c8\uc801\uc774\uba70, IIA \uc704\ubc18\uc774 \ub9e5\ub77d \ud6a8\uacfc, \uc989 \uc120\ud0dd \uc9d1\ud569 \ub0b4 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud568\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub9e5\ub77d \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \ubc18\uc601\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131 \uc120\ud0dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Arafatur Rahman"], "title": "A Fuzzy-Enhanced Explainable AI Framework for Flight Continuous Descent Operations Classification", "comment": null, "summary": "Continuous Descent Operations (CDO) involve smooth, idle-thrust descents that\navoid level-offs, reducing fuel burn, emissions, and noise while improving\nefficiency and passenger comfort. Despite its operational and environmental\nbenefits, limited research has systematically examined the factors influencing\nCDO performance. Moreover, many existing methods in related areas, such as\ntrajectory optimization, lack the transparency required in aviation, where\nexplainability is critical for safety and stakeholder trust. This study\naddresses these gaps by proposing a Fuzzy-Enhanced Explainable AI (FEXAI)\nframework that integrates fuzzy logic with machine learning and SHapley\nAdditive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis. For this purpose, a comprehensive\ndataset of 29 features, including 11 operational and 18 weather-related\nfeatures, was collected from 1,094 flights using Automatic Dependent\nSurveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data. Machine learning models and SHAP were then\napplied to classify flights' CDO adherence levels and rank features by\nimportance. The three most influential features, as identified by SHAP scores,\nwere then used to construct a fuzzy rule-based classifier, enabling the\nextraction of interpretable fuzzy rules. All models achieved classification\naccuracies above 90%, with FEXAI providing meaningful, human-readable rules for\noperational users. Results indicated that the average descent rate within the\narrival route, the number of descent segments, and the average change in\ndirectional heading during descent were the strongest predictors of CDO\nperformance.

This study integrates domain-specific semantic information by mapping\nthe SNOMED medical term hierarchy into a low-dimensional hyperbolic space using\nPoincar\\'e embeddings, with the aim of improving lung cancer onset prediction.\n  Methods: Using a retrospective cohort from the Optum EHR dataset, we derived\na clinical knowledge graph from the SNOMED taxonomy and generated Poincar\\'e\nembeddings via Riemannian stochastic gradient descent. These embeddings were\nthen incorporated into two deep learning architectures, a ResNet and a\nTransformer model. Models were evaluated for discrimination (area under the\nreceiver operating characteristic curve) and calibration (average absolute\ndifference between observed and predicted probabilities) performance.\n  Results: Incorporating pre-trained Poincar\\'e embeddings resulted in modest\nand consistent improvements in discrimination performance compared to baseline\nmodels using randomly initialized Euclidean embeddings. ResNet models,\nparticularly those using a 10-dimensional Poincar\\'e embedding, showed enhanced\ncalibration, whereas Transformer models maintained stable calibration across\nconfigurations.\n  Discussion: Embedding clinical knowledge graphs into hyperbolic space and\nintegrating these representations into deep learning models can improve lung\ncancer onset prediction by preserving the hierarchical structure of clinical\nterminologies used for prediction. This approach demonstrates a feasible method\nfor combining data-driven feature extraction with established clinical\nknowledge.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 Poincar\u00e9 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec SNOMED \uc758\ud559 \uc6a9\uc5b4 \uacc4\uce35\uc744 \uc800\ucc28\uc6d0 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ubcfc\ub9ad \uacf5\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \ub9e4\ud551\ud558\uc5ec \ud3d0\uc554 \ubc1c\ubcd1 \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud588\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc784\uc0c1 \uc608\uce21 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc784\uc0c1 \uac1c\ub150 \uac04\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ubb34\uc2dc\ud558\ub294 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud658\uc790 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud45c\ud604\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "Optum EHR \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc758 \uacfc\uac70 \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec SNOMED \ubd84\ub958\uc5d0\uc11c \uc784\uc0c1 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uace0, \ub9ac\ub9cc \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uacbd\ub7c9 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \ud558\uac15\ubc95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 Poincar\u00e9 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc740 ResNet \ubc0f Transformer \ubaa8\ub378\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc2ec\uce35 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c Poincar\u00e9 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ubb34\uc791\uc704\ub85c \ucd08\uae30\ud654\ub41c \uc720\ud074\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uae30\ubc18 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ubd84\ubcc4\ub825 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc801\uc808\ud558\uace0 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788 10\ucc28\uc6d0 Poincar\u00e9 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 ResNet \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ubcf4\uc815\uc774 \uac15\ud654\ub41c \ubc18\uba74, Transformer \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uad6c\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \ubcf4\uc815\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc784\uc0c1 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ubcfc\ub9ad \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uc2ec\uce35 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ud3d0\uc554 \ubc1c\ubcd1 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubc30\uacbd: \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc784\uc0c1 \uc608\uce21 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ud658\uc790\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud45c\ud604\ud560 \ub54c \uc784\uc0c1 \uac1c\ub150 \uac04\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8\uc801 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ubb34\uc2dc\ud558\ub294 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 SNOMED \uc758\ud559 \uc6a9\uc5b4 \uacc4\uce35\uc744 Poincar\u00e9 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc800\ucc28\uc6d0 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\ubcfc\ub9ad \uacf5\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \ub9e4\ud551\ud558\uc5ec \ud3d0\uc554 \ubc1c\ubcd1 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubc29\ubc95: Optum EHR \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc758 \uc790\uc8fc\uc801\uc778 \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec SNOMED \ubd84\ub958\uc5d0\uc11c \uc784\uc0c1 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uace0, \ub9ac\ub9cc \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uacbd\ub7c9 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \ud558\uac15\ubc95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 Poincar\u00e9 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc740 ResNet \ubc0f Transformer \ubaa8\ub378\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc2ec\uce35 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uc740 \ubd84\ubcc4\ub825(\uc218\uc2e0\uae30 \uc791\ub3d9 \ud2b9\uc131 \uace1\uc120 \uc544\ub798 \uc601\uc5ed) \ubc0f \ubcf4\uc815(\uad00\uce21\ub41c \ud655\ub960\uacfc \uc608\uce21\ub41c \ud655\ub960 \uac04\uc758 \ud3c9\uade0 \uc808\ub300 \ucc28\uc774) \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud3c9\uac00\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacb0\uacfc: \uc0ac\uc804 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c Poincar\u00e9 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ubb34\uc791\uc704\ub85c \ucd08\uae30\ud654\ub41c \uc720\ud074\ub9ac\ub4dc \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uae30\uc900 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ubd84\ubcc4\ub825 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc801\uc808\ud558\uace0 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.

The quantitative analysis of data significantly contributes to\nmodel training, enhancing both the efficiency and quality of data utilization.\nHowever, existing data analysis tools often lag in accuracy. For instance, many\nof these tools even assume that the loss function of neural networks is convex.\nThese limitations make it challenging to implement current methods effectively.\nIn this paper, we introduce a new formulation to approximate a sample's\ninfluence by accumulating the differences in influence between consecutive\nlearning steps, which we term Diff-In. Specifically, we formulate the\nsample-wise influence as the cumulative sum of its changes/differences across\nsuccessive training iterations. By employing second-order approximations, we\napproximate these difference terms with high accuracy while eliminating the\nneed for model convexity required by existing methods. Despite being a\nsecond-order method, Diff-In maintains computational complexity comparable to\nthat of first-order methods and remains scalable. This efficiency is achieved\nby computing the product of the Hessian and gradient, which can be efficiently\napproximated using finite differences of first-order gradients. We assess the\napproximation accuracy of Diff-In both theoretically and empirically. Our\ntheoretical analysis demonstrates that Diff-In achieves significantly lower\napproximation error compared to existing influence estimators.

However, similar to other machine learning models, GNNs\ncan exhibit bias in predictions based on attributes like race and gender.\nMoreover, bias in GNNs can be exacerbated by the graph structure and\nmessage-passing mechanisms. Recent cutting-edge methods propose mitigating bias\nby filtering out sensitive information from input or representations, like edge\ndropping or feature masking. Yet, we argue that such strategies may\nunintentionally eliminate non-sensitive features, leading to a compromised\nbalance between predictive accuracy and fairness. To tackle this challenge, we\npresent a novel approach utilizing counterfactual data augmentation for bias\nmitigation. This method involves creating diverse neighborhoods using\ncounterfactuals before message passing, facilitating unbiased node\nrepresentations learning from the augmented graph. Subsequently, an adversarial\ndiscriminator is employed to diminish bias in predictions by conventional GNN\nclassifiers.

Several works have been proposed to tackle this issue in the\nspatial domain. However, these methods overlook the complex relationships\nbetween node structure encoding, node features, and their contextual\nenvironment and rely on principled guidance, research on solving spectral\ndomain heterophilic problems remains limited. This study analyzes the spectral\ndistribution of nodes with different heterophilic degrees and discovers that\nthe heterophily of anomalous nodes causes the spectral energy to shift from low\nto high frequencies. To address the above challenges, we propose a spectral\nneural network CES2-GAD based on causal edge separation for anomaly detection\non heterophilic graphs. Firstly, CES2-GAD will separate the original graph into\nhomophilic and heterophilic edges using causal interventions.

Beyond sampling\nefficiently their own goals, autotelic agents specifically need to be able to\nkeep the growing complexity of goals under control, limiting the associated\ngrowth in sample and computational complexity. To adress this challenge, recent\napproaches have leveraged hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) and\nlanguage, capitalizing on its compositional and combinatorial generalization\ncapabilities to acquire temporally extended reusable behaviours. Existing\napproaches use expert defined spaces of subgoals over which they instantiate a\nhierarchy, and often assume pre-trained associated low-level policies. Such\ndesigns are inadequate in open-ended scenarios, where goal spaces naturally\ndiversify across a broad spectrum of difficulties. We introduce HERAKLES, a\nframework that enables a two-level hierarchical autotelic agent to continuously\ncompile mastered goals into the low-level policy, executed by a small, fast\nneural network, dynamically expanding the set of subgoals available to the\nhigh-level policy. We train a Large Language Model (LLM) to serve as the\nhigh-level controller, exploiting its strengths in goal decomposition and\ngeneralization to operate effectively over this evolving subgoal space. We\nevaluate HERAKLES in the open-ended Crafter environment and show that it scales\neffectively with goal complexity, improves sample efficiency through skill\ncompilation, and enables the agent to

The final version is available\n  at IEEE Xplore", "summary": "Federated distillation has emerged as a promising collaborative machine\nlearning approach, offering enhanced privacy protection and reduced\ncommunication compared to traditional federated learning by exchanging model\noutputs (soft logits) rather than full model parameters. However, existing\nmethods employ complex selective knowledge-sharing strategies that require\nclients to identify in-distribution proxy data through computationally\nexpensive statistical density ratio estimators. Additionally, server-side\nfiltering of ambiguous knowledge introduces latency to the process. To address\nthese challenges, we propose a robust, resource-efficient EdgeFD method that\nreduces the complexity of the client-side density ratio estimation and removes\nthe need for server-side filtering. EdgeFD introduces an efficient KMeans-based\ndensity ratio estimator for effectively filtering both in-distribution and\nout-of-distribution proxy data on clients, significantly improving the quality\nof knowledge sharing. We evaluate EdgeFD across diverse practical scenarios,\nincluding strong non-IID, weak non-IID, and IID data distributions on clients,\nwithout requiring a pre-trained teacher model on the server for knowledge\ndistillation.

To address this issue, we introduce \"context\nsteering,\" a novel methodology that actively guides the feature-shaping\nprocess. Instead of passively accepting the emergent data structure (typically\na hierarchy derived from clustering CDs), our approach \"steers\" the process by\nsystematically analyzing how each object influences the relational context\nwithin a clustering framework. This process generates a custom-tailored\nembedding that isolates and amplifies class-distinctive information. We\nvalidate the capabilities of this strategy using Normalized Compression\nDistance (NCD) and Relative Compression Distance (NRC) with common hierarchical\nclustering, providing an effective alternative to common transductive methods.\nExperimental results across heterogeneous datasets-from text to real-world\naudio-validate the robustness and generality of context steering, marking

Using UMAP-based dimensionality reduction and nearest\nneighbor sampling, our method identifies underperforming regions in the\nembedding space and generates targeted synthetic examples to guide student\nlearning. To further improve efficiency, we introduce a lightweight\nteacher-student interface that bypasses the teacher's input layer, enabling\ndirect distillation on vectorized representations. Experiments across standard\nNLP benchmarks demonstrate that our 66M-parameter student model consistently\nmatches or surpasses established baselines, achieving 91.2% on QNLI and 92.3%\non SST-2, while training with fewer epochs. These results highlight the promise\nof loss-aware data augmentation and vectorized distillation for efficient and\neffective model compression.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc99d\ub958 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub192\uc740 \uc190\uc2e4 \uc601\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc99d\uac15\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378 \uc555\ucd95\uc744 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ud589.", "motivation": "\uc790\uc6d0 \uc81c\uc57d \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc18c\ud615 \ud559\uc0dd \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c \uc804\uc774\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "UMAP \uae30\ubc18 \ucc28\uc6d0 \ucd95\uc18c\uc640 \ucd5c\uadfc\uc811 \uc774\uc6c3 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc190\uc2e4\uc774 \ud070 \uc601\uc5ed\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uace0 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub41c \ud569\uc131 \uc608\uc81c\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uacbd\ub7c9\uc758 \uad50\uc0ac-\ud559\uc0dd \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uad50\uc0ac\uc758 \uc785\ub825 \uce35\uc744 \uc6b0\ud68c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "66M \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130\uc758 \ud559\uc0dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 QNLI\uc5d0\uc11c 91.2%, SST-2\uc5d0\uc11c 92.3%\uc758 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ub0b4\uba70, \uc801\uc740 \uc5d0\ud3ed\uc73c\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc190\uc2e4 \uc778\uc2dd \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc99d\uac15\uacfc \ubca1\ud130\ud654\ub41c \uc99d\ub958\uac00 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc555\ucd95\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubaa8\ub378 \uc99d\ub958\ub294 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \uc18c\ud615 \ud559\uc0dd \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc804\uc774\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \uc790\uc6d0 \uc81c\uc57d \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubc30\ud3ec\ub97c \uc6a9\uc774\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc99d\ub958 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\uc640 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\ub294\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc190\uc2e4\uc774 \ub192\uc740 \ud559\uc0dd \ubaa8\ub378 \uc601\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc99d\uac15\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc99d\ub958 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

Zavlanos", "Karl H. Johansson"], "title": "Source-Guided Flow Matching", "comment": null, "summary": "Guidance of generative models is typically achieved by modifying the\nprobability flow vector field through the addition of a guidance field. In this\npaper, we instead propose the Source-Guided Flow Matching (SGFM) framework,\nwhich modifies the source distribution directly while keeping the pre-trained\nvector field intact. This reduces the guidance problem to a well-defined\nproblem of sampling from the source distribution. We theoretically show that\nSGFM recovers the desired target distribution exactly. Furthermore, we provide\nbounds on the Wasserstein error for the generated distribution when using an\napproximate sampler of the source distribution and an approximate vector field.\nThe key benefit of our approach is that it allows the user to flexibly choose\nthe sampling method depending on their specific problem.

However, we observe two major weaknesses of these studies: i) the\nlack of theoretical analysis for contrastive learning on link prediction, and\nii) inadequate consideration of node degrees in contrastive learning. To\naddress the above weaknesses, we provide the first formal theoretical analysis\nfor contrastive learning on link prediction, where our analysis results can\ngeneralize to the autoencoder-based link prediction models with contrastive\nlearning. Motivated by our analysis results, we propose a new graph\naugmentation approach, Edge Balancing Augmentation (EBA), which adjusts the\nnode degrees in the graph as the augmentation. We then propose a new approach,\nnamed Contrastive Link Prediction with Edge Balancing Augmentation (CoEBA),\nthat integrates the proposed EBA and the proposed new contrastive losses to\nimprove the model performance.

Despite the overall success of alignment techniques such as\nreinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) on typical prompts, LLMs\nremain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks enabled by crafted adversarial triggers\nappended to user prompts. Most existing jailbreak methods either rely on\ninefficient searches over discrete token spaces or direct optimization of\ncontinuous embeddings. While continuous embeddings can be given directly to\nselected open-source models as input, doing so is not feasible for proprietary\nmodels. On the other hand, projecting these embeddings back into valid discrete\ntokens introduces additional complexity and often reduces attack effectiveness.\nWe propose an intrinsic optimization method which directly optimizes relaxed\none-hot encodings of the adversarial suffix tokens using exponentiated gradient\ndescent coupled with Bregman projection, ensuring that the optimized one-hot\nencoding of each token always remains within the probability simplex. We\nprovide theoretical proof of convergence for our proposed method and implement\nan efficient algorithm that effectively jailbreaks several widely used LLMs.\nOur method achieves higher success rates and faster convergence compared to\nthree state-of-the-art baselines, evaluated on five open-source LLMs and four\nadversarial behavior datasets curated for evaluating jailbreak methods.

Motivated by the way quantum squeezed states\nredistribute uncertainty according to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, we\nintroduce Squeezed Diffusion Models (SDM), which scale noise anisotropically\nalong the principal component of the training distribution. As squeezing\nenhances the signal-to-noise ratio in physics, we hypothesize that scaling\nnoise in a data-dependent manner can better assist diffusion models in learning\nimportant data features. We study two configurations: (i) a Heisenberg\ndiffusion model that compensates the scaling on the principal axis with inverse\nscaling on orthogonal directions and (ii) a standard SDM variant that scales\nonly the principal axis. Counterintuitively, on CIFAR-10/100 and CelebA-64,\nmild antisqueezing - i.e. increasing variance on the principal axis -\nconsistently improves FID by up to 15% and shifts the precision-recall frontier\ntoward higher recall. Our results demonstrate that simple, data-aware noise\nshaping can deliver robust generative gains without architectural changes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ubb34\uc2dc\ud558\ub294 \ub300\uc2e0 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc758 \uc8fc\uc131\ubd84\uc744 \ub530\ub77c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \ubd84\ubc30\ud558\ub294 Squeezed Diffusion Models(SDM)\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc591\uc790 \uc555\ucd95 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uac00 \ud558\uc774\uc820\ubca0\ub974\ud06c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc6d0\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uc7ac\ubd84\ubc30\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ub3d9\uae30\ubd80\uc5ec\ub85c \uc0bc\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud6c8\ub828 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc758 \uc8fc\uc131\ubd84\uc744 \ub530\ub77c \ube44\ub4f1\ubc29\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc7a1\uc74c\uc744 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 SDM\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "CIFAR-10/100 \ubc0f CelebA-64\uc5d0\uc11c \uc18c\ud3ed\uc758 \uc800\uc555\ucd95\uc740 FID\ub97c \ucd5c\ub300 15% \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0 \uc815\ubc00\ub3c4-\uc7ac\ud604\uc728 \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \ub192\uc740 \uc7ac\ud604\uc728 \ucabd\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\ub3d9\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc778\uc2dd \uc7a1\uc74c \ud615\uc131\uc774 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ubcc0\uacbd \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc0dd\uc131\uc801 \uc774\ub4dd\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ubb34\uc2dc\ud558\uace0 \ub4f1\ubc29\uc131 \uac00\uc6b0\uc2dc\uc548 \uc7a1\uc74c\uc744 \uc8fc\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud558\uc774\uc820\ubca0\ub974\ud06c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc6d0\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc591\uc790 \uc555\ucd95 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uac00 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uc7ac\ubd84\ubc30\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc5d0 \uc790\uadf9\uc744 \ubc1b\uc544, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc758 \uc8fc\uc131\ubd84\uc744 \ub530\ub77c \uc7a1\uc74c\uc744 \ube44\ub4f1\ubc29\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 Squeezed Diffusion Models(SDM)\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc555\ucd95\uc774 \ubb3c\ub9ac\ud559\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e0\ud638 \ub300 \uc7a1\uc74c\ube44\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uac83\ucc98\ub7fc, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc758\uc874\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc7a1\uc74c\uc744 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc744 \uc904 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4\uace0 \uac00\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc124\uc815\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: (i) \uc8fc \ucd95\uc758 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1\uc744 \ubcf4\uc644\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc9c1\uad50 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc18\ub300 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ud558\uc774\uc820\ubca0\ub974\ud06c \ud655\uc0b0 \ubaa8\ub378, (ii) \uc8fc \ucd95\ub9cc\uc744 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \ud45c\uc900 SDM \ubcc0\ud615. \uc9c1\uad00\uc5d0 \ubc18\ud558\uc5ec, CIFAR-10/100 \ubc0f CelebA-64\uc5d0\uc11c \uacbd\ubbf8\ud55c \uc800\uc555\ucd95 - \uc989 \uc8fc \ucd95\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd84\uc0b0\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uac83 -\uc740 FID\ub97c \ucd5c\ub300 15%\uae4c\uc9c0 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0 \uc815\ubc00\ub3c4-\uc7ac\ud604\uc728 \uacbd\uacc4\ub97c \ub192\uc740 \uc7ac\ud604\uc728 \ucabd\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\ub3d9\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uac04\ub2e8\ud558\uace0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \uae30\ucd08\ud55c \uc7a1\uc74c \ud615\ud0dc\uac00 \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ubcc0\uacbd \uc5c6\uc774\ub3c4 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc0dd\uc131\uc801 \uc774\ub4dd\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

While such scaling has been well studied for\nlanguage modeling, reinforcement learning (RL) has received less attention in\nthis regard. In this paper, we investigate compute scaling for online,\nvalue-based deep RL. These methods present two primary axes for compute\nallocation: model capacity and the update-to-data (UTD) ratio. Given a fixed\ncompute budget, we ask: how should resources be partitioned across these axes\nto maximize sample efficiency? Our analysis reveals a nuanced interplay between\nmodel size, batch size, and UTD. In particular, we identify a phenomenon we\ncall TD-overfitting: increasing the batch quickly harms Q-function accuracy for\nsmall models, but this effect is absent in large models, enabling effective use\nof large batch size at scale. We provide a mental model for understanding this\nphenomenon and build guidelines for choosing batch size and UTD to optimize\ncompute usage. Our findings provide a grounded starting point for\ncompute-optimal scaling in deep RL, mirroring studies in supervised learning\nbut adapted to TD learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uac00\uce58 \uae30\ubc18 \uc2ec\uce35 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc790\uc6d0 \ubc30\ubd84 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ucee4\uc9c0\uace0 \ud6c8\ub828\uc774 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305 \uc790\uc6d0\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud574\uc9c4\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubaa8\ub378 \uc6a9\ub7c9\uacfc \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8 \ube44\uc728(UTD) \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ucd95\uc5d0\uc11c \uc790\uc6d0\uc744 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ubc30\ubd84\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ubaa8\ub378 \ud06c\uae30, \ubc30\uce58 \ud06c\uae30, UTD \uc0ac\uc774\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uace0, \uc791\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0 \ubc30\uce58\ub97c \ub298\ub9ac\uba74 Q-\ud568\uc218 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uac00 \uac10\uc18c\ud558\ub294 TD-\uacfc\uc801\ud569 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc2ec\uce35 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305 \uc790\uc6d0 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ubc30\uce58 \ud06c\uae30 \ubc0f UTD \uc120\ud0dd\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac00\uc774\ub4dc\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ucee4\uc9c0\uace0 \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub4e4\uba74\uc11c, \ub354 \ud070 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ub354 \ub9ce\uc740 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucdb0 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub808\uc2dc\ud53c\ub97c \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c, \ub2e8\uc704 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305 \ub2f9 \ucd5c\ub300 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub04c\uc5b4\ub0b4\ub294 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ucd5c\uc801 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uc911\uc694\ud574\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5\uc740 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uc798 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub418\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uadf8\ub807\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uac00\uce58 \uae30\ubc18 \uc2ec\uce35 RL\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc6a9\ub7c9\uacfc \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8(RTD) \ube44\uc728\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \ucd95\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305 \ud560\ub2f9\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \uace0\uc815\ub41c \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305 \uc608\uc0b0\uc774 \uc8fc\uc5b4\uc84c\uc744 \ub54c, \uc790\uc6d0\uc744 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ucd95\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \ubd84\ubc30\ud574\uc57c \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0 \uc9c8\ubb38\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubd84\uc11d\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud06c\uae30, \ubc30\uce58 \ud06c\uae30 \ubc0f UTD \uc0ac\uc774\uc758 \ubbf8\ubb18\ud55c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b8\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 TD-\uacfc\uc801\ud569\uc774\ub77c\uace0 \ubd80\ub974\ub294 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\ub294\ub370, \uc774\ub294 \uc791\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0 \ubc30\uce58\ub97c \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba74 Q-\ud568\uc218 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uac00 \ube60\ub974\uac8c \uc800\ud558\ub418\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud070 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud6a8\uacfc\uac00 \uc5c6\uc5b4\uc11c \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ubc30\uce58 \ud06c\uae30\ub97c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc815\uc2e0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0, \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305 \uc790\uc6d0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubc30\uce58 \ud06c\uae30 \ubc0f UTD\ub97c \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\ub294 \uac00\uc774\ub4dc\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc1c\uacac\uc740 TD \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucdb0 \uc870\uc815\ub41c \uac10\ub3c5 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ubc18\uc601\ud558\uc5ec \uc2ec\uce35 RL\uc5d0\uc11c \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305 \ucd5c\uc801 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub9c1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uacac\uace0\ud55c \ucd9c\ubc1c\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4."}}
