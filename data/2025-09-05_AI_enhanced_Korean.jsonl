A structured thematic\nsynthesis revealed four categories of outcomes: (1) Convergent themes -\ncommitment-based demand signals, black-box trust barriers, and efficiency gains\nwere consistently emphasized across both datasets; (2) Partial overlaps -\nfounders worried about outliers being averaged away and the stress of real\ncustomer validation, while synthetic personas highlighted irrational blind\nspots and framed AI as a psychological buffer; (3) Human-only themes -\nrelational and advocacy value from early customer engagement and skepticism\ntoward moonshot markets; and (4) Synthetic-only themes - amplified false\npositives and trauma blind spots, where AI may overstate adoption potential by\nmissing negative historical experiences.\n  We interpret this comparative framework as evidence that LLM-driven personas\nconstitute a form of hybrid social simulation: more linguistically expressive\nand adaptable than traditional rule-based agents, yet bounded by the absence of\nlived history and relational consequence. Rather than replacing empirical\nstudies, we argue they function as a complementary simulation category -\ncapable of extending hypothesis space, accelerating exploratory validation, and\nclarifying the boundaries of cognitive realism in computational social science.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \uae30\ubc18 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ucda9\uc2e4\ub3c4, \ubc1c\uc0b0\uc131 \ubc0f \ub9f9\uc810\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc778\uac04 \ub300\uc0c1 \uc778\ud130\ubdf0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ud569\uc131 \uc778\ubb3c\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud558\ub294 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AI \uae30\ubc18 \uac80\uc99d\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2a4\ud0c0\ud2b8\uc5c5 \ucc3d\ub9bd\uc790\ub4e4\uc758 \ud76c\ub9dd\uacfc \uc6b0\ub824\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "15\uba85\uc758 \ucd08\uae30 \ub2e8\uacc4 \uc2a4\ud0c0\ud2b8\uc5c5 \ucc3d\ub9bd\uc790\uc640 AI \uc0dd\uc131 \ucc3d\ub9bd\uc790 \ubc0f \ud22c\uc790\uc790\uc758 \uc131\uaca9\uc73c\ub85c \uac19\uc740 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc744 \ubc18\ubcf5\ud558\uc5ec \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc8fc\uc81c \ud569\uc131\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "4\uac1c\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc \ubc94\uc8fc\uac00 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4: 1) \uc218\ub834 \ud14c\ub9c8, 2) \ubd80\ubd84\uc801 \uacb9\uce68, 3) \uc778\uac04 \uc804\uc6a9 \ud14c\ub9c8, 4) \ud569\uc131 \uc804\uc6a9 \ud14c\ub9c8.", "conclusion": "LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc778\ubb3c\uc740 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ub300\uccb4\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \ubcf4\uc644\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uce74\ud14c\uace0\ub9ac\ub85c \uc791\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud558\uba70, \uac00\uc124 \ubc94\uc704\ub97c \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uace0 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc801 \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \uc9c0\uc6d0 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ucda9\uc2e4\ub3c4, \ubc1c\uc0b0, \ub9f9\uc810\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc778\uac04 \ub300\uc0c1 \uc778\ud130\ubdf0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM) \uc8fc\ub3c4 \ud569\uc131 \ud398\ub974\uc18c\ub098\ub97c \uc815\ub82c\ud558\ub294 \ube44\uad50\uc801 \ub3c4\ud0b9 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. 15\uba85\uc758 \ucd08\uae30 \ub2e8\uacc4 \uc2a4\ud0c0\ud2b8\uc5c5 \ucc3d\ub9bd\uc790\ub4e4\uc744 \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \uae30\ubc18 \uac80\uc99d\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud76c\ub9dd\uacfc \uc6b0\ub824\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc778\ud130\ubdf0\ub97c \uc9c4\ud589\ud558\uace0, \uac19\uc740 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc774 AI \uc0dd\uc131 \ucc3d\ub9bd\uc790 \ubc0f \ud22c\uc790\uc790 \ud398\ub974\uc18c\ub098\uc640 \ud568\uaed8 \ubc18\ubcf5\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc8fc\uc81c \ud569\uc131\uc740 \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \uacb0\uacfc \ubc94\uc8fc\ub97c \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4: (1) \uc218\ub834 \ud14c\ub9c8 - \uc57d\uc18d \uae30\ubc18 \uc218\uc694 \uc2e0\ud638, \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4 \uc2e0\ub8b0 \uc7a5\ubcbd, \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \uc99d\ub300\uac00 \ub450 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uac15\uc870\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4;

Firstly, we demonstrate that the\nstandard HDP framework falls short when user data and privacy demands are\nallowed to be correlated. Secondly, to address this shortcoming, we propose an\nalternate framework, Add-remove Heterogeneous Differential Privacy (AHDP), that\njointly accounts for user data and privacy preference. We show that AHDP is\nrobust to possible correlations between data and privacy. Thirdly, we formalize\nthe guarantees of the proposed AHDP framework through an operational hypothesis\ntesting perspective. The hypothesis testing setup may be of independent\ninterest in analyzing other privacy frameworks as well. Fourthly, we show that\nthere exists non-trivial AHDP mechanisms that notably do not require prior\nknowledge of the data-privacy correlations. We propose some such mechanisms and\napply them to core statistical tasks such as mean estimation, frequency\nestimation, and linear regression. The proposed mechanisms are simple to\nimplement with minimal assumptions and modeling requirements, making them\nattractive for real-world use. Finally, we empirically evaluate proposed AHDP\nmechanisms, highlighting their trade-offs using LLM-generated synthetic\ndatasets, which we release for future research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774

Many complex systems\nof interest, such as epidemics or financial markets, involve thousands or even\nmillions of agents. Consequently, ABMs often become computationally demanding\nand rely on the calibration of numerous free parameters, which has\nsignificantly hindered their widespread adoption. In this paper, we demonstrate\nthat automatic differentiation (AD) techniques can effectively alleviate these\ncomputational burdens. By applying AD to ABMs, the gradients of the simulator\nbecome readily available, greatly facilitating essential tasks such as\ncalibration and sensitivity analysis. Specifically, we show how AD enables\nvariational inference (VI) techniques for efficient parameter calibration. Our\nexperiments demonstrate substantial performance improvements and computational\nsavings using VI on three prominent ABMs: Axtell's model of firms; Sugarscape;\nand the SIR epidemiological model.

A\ncritical factor in improving LLM-based applications is the design of effective\nsystem prompts, which significantly impact the behavior and output quality of\nLLMs. However, system prompts are susceptible to theft and misuse, which could\nundermine the interests of prompt owners. Existing methods protect prompt\ncopyrights through watermark injection and verification but face challenges due\nto their reliance on intermediate LLM outputs (e.g., logits), which limits\ntheir practical feasibility.\n  In this paper, we propose PromptCOS, a method for auditing prompt copyright\nbased on content-level output similarity. It embeds watermarks by optimizing\nthe prompt while simultaneously co-optimizing a special verification query and\ncontent-level signal marks. This is achieved by leveraging cyclic output\nsignals and injecting auxiliary tokens to ensure reliable auditing in\ncontent-only scenarios. Additionally, it incorporates cover tokens to protect\nthe watermark from malicious deletion. For copyright verification, PromptCOS\nidentifies unauthorized usage by comparing the similarity between the\nsuspicious output and the signal mark. Experimental results demonstrate that\nour method achieves high effectiveness (99.3% average watermark similarity),\nstrong distinctiveness (60.8% greater than the best baseline), high fidelity\n(accuracy degradation of no more than 0.58%), robustness (resilience against\nthree types of potential attacks), and computational efficiency (up to 98.1%\nreduction in computational cost).

However, even when optimized, these operators can be\nexpensive to execute on millions of records and their iterator execution\nsemantics make them ill-suited for interactive data analytics tasks. In another\nline of work, Deep Research systems have demonstrated an ability to answer\nnatural language question(s) over large datasets. These systems use one or more\nLLM agent(s) to plan their execution, process the dataset(s), and iteratively\nrefine their answer. However, these systems do not explicitly optimize their\nquery plans which can lead to poor plan execution. In order for AI-driven\nanalytics to excel, we need a runtime which combines the optimized execution of\nsemantic operators with the flexibility and more dynamic execution of Deep\nResearch systems. As a first step towards this vision, we build a prototype\nwhich enables Deep Research agents to write and execute optimized semantic\noperator programs. We evaluate our prototype and demonstrate that it can\noutperform a handcrafted semantic operator program and open Deep Research\nsystems on two basic queries.

Many studies have focused on tuning various components,\nsuch as databases, network bandwidth, and consensus mechanisms. However, the\nimpact of block size on system performance remains a topic of debate, often\nresulting in divergent views and even leading to new forks in blockchain\nnetworks. This research proposes a mathematical model to maximize performance\nby determining the ideal block size for Hyperledger Fabric, a prominent\nconsortium blockchain. By leveraging machine learning and solving the model\nwith a genetic algorithm, the proposed approach assesses how factors such as\nblock size, transaction size, and network capacity influence the block\nprocessing time. The integration of an optimization solver enables precise\nadjustments to block size configuration before deployment, ensuring improved\nperformance from the outset. This systematic approach aims to balance block\nprocessing efficiency, network latency, and system throughput, offering a\nrobust solution to improve blockchain performance across diverse business\ncontexts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ube14\ub85d\uccb4\uc778 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \ube14\ub85d \ud06c\uae30\ub97c \uacb0\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ub192\uc740

Within DRL-based TSC methods, two primary control\nparadigms are ``choose phase\" and ``switch\" strategies. Although the agent in\nthe choose phase paradigm selects the next active phase adaptively, this\nparadigm may result in unexpected phase sequences for drivers, disrupting their\nanticipation and potentially compromising safety at intersections. Meanwhile,\nthe switch paradigm allows the agent to decide whether to switch to the next\npredefined phase or extend the current phase. While this structure maintains a\nmore predictable order, it can lead to unfair and inefficient phase\nallocations, as certain movements may be extended disproportionately while\nothers are neglected. In this paper, we propose a DRL model, named Deep\nHierarchical Cycle Planner (DHCP), to allocate the traffic signal cycle\nduration hierarchically. A high-level agent first determines the split of the\ntotal cycle time between the North-South (NS) and East-West (EW) directions\nbased on the overall traffic state.

Traditional control systems, which are human\nand optimization-based, struggle to adapt and to scale in such an evolving\ncontext, motivating the exploration of more dynamic and distributed control\nstrategies. This work advances a graph-based distributed reinforcement learning\nframework for real-time, scalable grid management. The proposed architecture\nconsists of a network of distributed low-level agents acting on individual\npower lines and coordinated by a high-level manager agent. A Graph Neural\nNetwork (GNN) is employed to encode the network's topological information\nwithin the single low-level agent's observation. To accelerate convergence and\nenhance learning stability, the framework integrates imitation learning and\npotential-based reward shaping. In contrast to conventional decentralized\napproaches that decompose only the action space while relying on global\nobservations, this method also decomposes the observation space. Each low-level\nagent acts based on a structured and informative local view of the environment\nconstructed through the GNN. Experiments on the Grid2Op simulation environment\nshow the effectiveness of the approach, which consistently outperforms the\nstandard baseline commonly adopted in the field.

This study introduces\nQuantum-Inspired SMOTE (QI-SMOTE), a novel data augmentation technique that\nenhances the performance of ML classifiers, including Random Forest (RF),\nSupport Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), k-Nearest Neighbors\n(KNN), Gradient Boosting (GB), and Neural Networks, by leveraging quantum\nprinciples such as quantum evolution and layered entanglement. Unlike\nconventional oversampling methods, QI-SMOTE generates synthetic instances that\npreserve complex data structures, improving model generalization and\nclassification accuracy. We validate QI-SMOTE on the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV\ndatasets, using mortality detection as a benchmark task due to their clinical\nsignificance and inherent class imbalance. We compare our method against\ntraditional oversampling techniques, including Borderline-SMOTE, ADASYN,\nSMOTE-ENN, SMOTE-TOMEK, and SVM-SMOTE, using key performance metrics such as\nAccuracy, F1-score, G-Mean, and AUC-ROC. The results demonstrate that QI-SMOTE\nsignificantly improves the effectiveness of ensemble methods (RF, GB, ADA),\nkernel-based models (SVM), and deep learning approaches by producing more\ninformative and balanced training data. By integrating quantum-inspired\ntransformations into the ML pipeline, QI-SMOTE not only mitigates class\nimbalance but also enhances the robustness and reliability of predictive models\nin medical diagnostics and decision-making.

Jensen"], "title": "Improving Generative Methods for Causal Evaluation via Simulation-Based Inference", "comment": "12 pages main text, 48 pages total", "summary": "Generating synthetic datasets that accurately reflect real-world\nobservational data is critical for evaluating causal estimators, but remains a\nchallenging task. Existing generative methods offer a solution by producing\nsynthetic datasets anchored in the observed data (source data) while allowing\nvariation in key parameters such as the treatment effect and amount of\nconfounding bias. However, existing methods typically require users to provide\npoint estimates of such parameters (rather than distributions) and fixed\nestimates (rather than estimates that can be improved with reference to the\nsource data). This denies users the ability to express uncertainty over\nparameter values and removes the potential for posterior inference, potentially\nleading to unreliable estimator comparisons. We introduce simulation-based\ninference for causal evaluation (SBICE), a framework that models generative\nparameters as uncertain and infers their posterior distribution given a source\ndataset. Leveraging techniques in simulation-based inference, SBICE identifies\nparameter configurations that produce synthetic datasets closely aligned with\nthe source data distribution. Empirical results demonstrate that SBICE improves\nthe reliability of estimator evaluations by generating more realistic datasets,\nwhich supports a robust and data-consistent approach to causal benchmarking\nunder uncertainty.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uc778\uacfc \ucd94\uc815\uae30\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc911\uc694\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \uacfc\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc778\uacfc \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud55c \uc0dd\uc131 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uc5ec \uc18c\uc2a4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc801\uc808\ud55c \ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \uc778\uacfc \ucd94\uc815\uae30\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "SBICE \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc0dd\uc131 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud55c \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uace0 \uc18c\uc2a4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud6c4\ud5a5 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \ucd94\ub860\ud558\uc5ec \ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "SBICE\ub294 \uc18c\uc2a4 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubc30\ud3ec\uc640 \ubc00\uc811\ud558\uac8c \uc815\ub82c\ub41c \ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \ucd94\uc815\uae30 \ud3c9\uac00\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "SBICE\ub294 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uacfc \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud0b9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud558\uace0 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc2e4\uc81c \uad00\uce21 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ubc18\uc601\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc778\uacfc \ucd94\uc815\uae30\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uad00\ucc30 \ub370\uc774\ud130(\uc18c\uc2a4 \ub370\uc774\ud130)\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uce58\ub8cc \ud6a8\uacfc \ubc0f \ud63c\ub780 \ubc14\uc774\uc5b4\uc2a4\uc758 \uc591\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc8fc\uc694 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\uc5d0 \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \ud5c8\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uac00 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\uc758 \ubd84\ud3ec\uac00 \uc544\ub2cc \uc810 \ucd94\uc815\uce58\uc640 \uc18c\uc2a4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ucc38\uc870\ud558\uc5ec \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ucd94\uc815\uce58\uac00 \uc544\ub2cc \uace0\uc815 \ucd94\uc815\uce58\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc694\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uac00 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \uac12\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \ud45c\ud604\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubc15\ud0c8\ud558\uace0 \ud6c4\ud5a5 \ucd94\ub860\uc758 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uac70\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \ucd94\uc815\uae30 \ube44\uad50\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc9c8 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc778\uacfc \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uae30\ubc18 \ucd94\ub860(SBICE)\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \uc774\uac83\uc740 \uc0dd\uc131 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\ud55c \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uace0 \uc18c\uc2a4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud558\uc5ec \ud6c4\ud5a5 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \ucd94\ub860\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uae30\ubc18 \ucd94\ub860 \uae30\uc220\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec SBICE\ub294 \uc18c\uc2a4 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubc30\ud3ec\uc640 \ubc00\uc811\ud558\uac8c \uc815\ub82c\ub41c \ud569\uc131 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \uad6c\uc131\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 SBICE\uac00 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ucd94\uc815\uae30 \ud3c9\uac00\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uba70, \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uacfc \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud0b9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud558\uace0 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc77c\uad00\ub41c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Lintunen"], "title": "VendiRL: A Framework for Self-Supervised Reinforcement Learning of Diversely Diverse Skills", "comment": "17 pages including appendices", "summary": "In self-supervised reinforcement learning (RL), one of the key challenges is\nlearning a diverse set of skills to prepare agents for unknown future tasks.\nDespite impressive advances, scalability and evaluation remain prevalent\nissues. Regarding scalability, the search for meaningful skills can be obscured\nby high-dimensional feature spaces, where relevant features may vary across\ndownstream task domains. For evaluating skill diversity, defining what\nconstitutes \"diversity\" typically requires a hard commitment to a specific\nnotion of what it means for skills to be diverse, potentially leading to\ninconsistencies in how skill diversity is understood, making results across\ndifferent approaches hard to compare, and leaving many forms of diversity\nunexplored.

For\nexample, high-speed X-ray imaging offers valuable spatial information about\nsubsurface melt pool behavior but is costly and impractical for most industrial\nsettings. In contrast, absorptivity data from low-cost photodiodes correlate\nwith melt pool dynamics but is often too noisy for accurate prediction when\nused alone. In this paper, we propose a multimodal data fusion approach for\npredicting melt pool dynamics by combining high-fidelity X-ray data with\nlow-fidelity absorptivity data in the Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) process.\nOur multimodal learning framework integrates convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs) for spatial feature extraction from X-ray data with recurrent neural\nnetworks (RNNs) for temporal feature extraction from absorptivity signals,\nusing an early fusion strategy. The multimodal model is further used as a\ntransfer learning model to fine-tune the RNN model that can predict melt pool\ndynamics only with absorptivity, with greater accuracy compared to the\nmultimodal model. Results show that training with both modalities significantly\nimproves prediction accuracy compared to using either modality alone.\nFurthermore, once trained, the model can infer melt pool characteristics using\nonly absorptivity data, eliminating the need for expensive X-ray imaging.

However, extending this success to other\nreasoning-intensive domains remains challenging due to the scarcity of\nhigh-quality, verifiable datasets and the high cost of human supervision. In\nthis work, we introduce the Loong Project: an open-source framework for\nscalable synthetic data generation and verification across a diverse range of\nreasoning-intensive domains. The framework consists of two key components: (1)\nLoongBench, a curated seed dataset containing 8,729 human-vetted examples\nacross 12 domains (e.g., Advanced Mathematics, Chemistry, Logic), each paired\nwith executable code and rich metadata; and (2) LoongEnv, a modular synthetic\ndata generation environment that supports multiple prompting strategies to\nproduce new question-answer-code triples. Together, these components form an\nagent-environment loop that enables reinforcement learning, where an LLM-based\nagent is rewarded for generating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) solutions that align\nwith code-executed answers. Empirically, we benchmark LoongBench on a broad\nsuite of both open-source and proprietary LLMs to evaluate domain coverage and\nreveal performance bottlenecks. In addition, we conduct a comprehensive\nanalysis of synthetic data generated by LoongEnv, examining correctness,\ndifficulty, and diversity.

Although imitation learning, within\nthe domain of supervised learning, offers faster convergence, it relies heavily\non human-generated demonstrations. Recently, Goal-Conditioned Supervised\nLearning (GCSL) has emerged as a potential solution by enabling self-imitation\nlearning for autonomous systems. By strategically relabelling goals, agents can\nderive policy insights from their own experiences. Despite the successes of\nthis framework, it presents two notable limitations: (1) Learning exclusively\nfrom self-generated experiences can exacerbate the agents' inherent biases; (2)\nThe relabelling strategy allows agents to focus solely on successful outcomes,\nprecluding them from learning from their mistakes. To address these issues, we\npropose a novel model that integrates contrastive learning principles into the\nGCSL framework to learn from both success and failure. Through empirical\nevaluations, we demonstrate that our algorithm overcomes limitations imposed by\nagents' initial biases and thereby enables more exploratory behavior. This\nfacilitates the identification and adoption of effective policies, leading to\nsuperior performance across a variety of challenging environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 Goal-Conditioned Supervised Learning(GCSL) \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0 \ub300\uc870 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc6d0\uce59\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc131\uacf5\uacfc \uc2e4\ud328 \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uc11c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \ud76c\uc18c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud560 \ub54c \ud070 \ub3c4\uc804\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc778\uac04\uc774 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c \uc2dc\uc5f0\uc5d0 \ud06c\uac8c \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294 \ubaa8\ubc29 \ud559\uc2b5\uc740 \ub354 \ube60\ub978 \uc218\ub834\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

However, its design\ndepends on hand-crafted formulas (e.g., Webster) and manual re-timing by\nengineers to adapt to demand changes, which is labor-intensive and often yields\nsuboptimal results under heterogeneous or congested conditions. This paper\nintroduces the EvolveSignal, a large language models (LLMs) powered coding\nagent to automatically discover new traffic signal control algorithms. We\nformulate the problem as program synthesis, where candidate algorithms are\nrepresented as Python functions with fixed input-output structures, and\niteratively optimized through external evaluations (e.g., a traffic simulator)\nand evolutionary search. Experiments on a signalized intersection demonstrate\nthat the discovered algorithms outperform Webster's baseline, reducing average\ndelay by 20.1% and average stops by 47.1%. Beyond performance, ablation and\nincremental analyses reveal that EvolveSignal modifications-such as adjusting\ncycle length bounds, incorporating right-turn demand, and rescaling green\nallocations-can offer practically meaningful insights for traffic engineers.\nThis work opens a new research direction by leveraging AI for algorithm design\nin traffic signal control, bridging program synthesis with transportation\nengineering.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 EvolveSignal\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc790\ub3d9 \ud2b8\ub798\ud53d \uc2e0\ud638 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \ubc1c\uacac \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uace0\uc815\ud615 \ud2b8\ub798\ud53d \uc2e0\ud638 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub294 \uc800\ube44\uc6a9\uacfc \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc218\uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \ucd5c\uc801\uc774 \uc544\ub2cc \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8 \ud569\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uace0, \ud6c4\ubcf4 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uace0\uc815 \uc785\ub825-\ucd9c\ub825 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \ud30c\uc774\uc36c \ud568\uc218\ub85c \ud45c\ud604\ud558\uc5ec \uc678\ubd80 \ud3c9\uac00\uc640 \uc9c4\ud654\uc801 \uac80\uc0c9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ubc1c\uacac\ub41c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc774 Webster\uc758 \uae30\uc900\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud3c9\uade0 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc744 20.1% \uc904\uc774\uace0 \ud3c9\uade0 \uc815\uc9c0\ub97c 47.1% \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ucf30\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "EvolveSignal\uc740 \ud2b8\ub798\ud53d \uc2e0\ud638 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \ub514\uc790\uc778\uc5d0 AI\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc5f0\uad6c \ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \uc5f4\uc5b4\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uad50\ud1b5 \uacf5\ud559\uc5d0\uc11c \uace0\uc815 \uc2dc\uac04 \uad50\ud1b5 \uc2e0\ud638 \uc81c\uc5b4\ub294 \uc800\ub834\ud55c \ube44\uc6a9, \uc548\uc815\uc131 \ubc0f \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \ub355\ubd84\uc5d0 \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uadf8 \uc124\uacc4\ub294 \uc218\uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \ub9cc\ub4e0 \uacf5\uc2dd(\uc608: \uc6e8\ube0c\uc2a4\ud130) \ubc0f \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\uc758 \uc218\ub3d9 \uc7ac\ud0c0\uc774\ubc0d\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \uc218\uc694 \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub294 \ub178\ub3d9\uc9d1\uc57d\uc801\uc774\uba70 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc774\uac70\ub098 \ud63c\uc7a1\ud55c \uc870\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc885\uc885 \ucd5c\uc801\uc774 \uc544\ub2cc \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uad50\ud1b5 \uc2e0\ud638 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\ub294 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs) \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ucf54\ub529 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc778 EvolveSignal\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8 \ud569\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654\ud558\uba70, \ud6c4\ubcf4 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \uace0\uc815\ub41c \uc785\ub825-\ucd9c\ub825 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \ud30c\uc774\uc36c \ud568\uc218\ub85c \ud45c\ud604\ub418\uace0, \uc678\ubd80 \ud3c9\uac00(\uc608: \uad50\ud1b5 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\ud130)\uc640 \uc9c4\ud654\uc801 \uac80\uc0c9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e0\ud638\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \uad50\ucc28\ub85c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc \ubc1c\uacac\ub41c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \uc6e8\ube0c\uc2a4\ud130\uc758 \uae30\uc900\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc6b0\uc218\ud558\uba70, \ud3c9\uade0 \uc9c0\uc5f0\uc744 20.1% \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \ud3c9\uade0 \uc815\uc9c0\ub97c 47.1% \uc904\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc131\ub2a5 \uc678\uc5d0\ub3c4, \uc81c\uac70 \ubc0f \uc810\uc9c4\uc801 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 EvolveSignal\uc758 \uc218\uc815 \uc0ac\ud56d, \uc989 \uc0ac\uc774\ud074 \uae38\uc774 \ubc94\uc704 \uc870\uc815, \uc6b0\ud68c\uc804 \uc218\uc694 \ud3ec\ud568, \ub179\uc0c9 \ud560\ub2f9 \uc870\uc815 \ub4f1\uc774 \uad50\ud1b5 \uc5d4\uc9c0\ub2c8\uc5b4\uc5d0\uac8c \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc758\ubbf8 \uc788\ub294 \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uad50\ud1b5 \uc2e0\ud638 \uc81c\uc5b4\uc758 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \uc124\uacc4\uc5d0 AI\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc5f0\uad6c \ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \uc5f4\uc5b4\uc8fc\uba70, \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8 \ud569\uc131\uacfc \uad50\ud1b5 \uacf5\ud559\uc744 \uc5f0\uacb0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

In\nthis work, we propose a generative framework based on flow matching to model\nthe full probability distribution over bifurcation outcomes. Our method enables\ndirect sampling of multiple valid solutions while preserving system symmetries\nthrough equivariant modeling. We introduce a symmetric matching strategy that\naligns predicted and target outputs under group actions, allowing accurate\nlearning in equivariant settings. We validate our approach on a range of\nsystems, from toy models to complex physical problems such as buckling beams\nand the Allen-Cahn equation. Our results demonstrate that flow matching\nsignificantly outperforms non-probabilistic and variational methods in\ncapturing multimodal distributions and symmetry-breaking bifurcations, offering\na

Traditional methods often overlook\nagents' diverse computational capabilities and complex operating environments,\nleading to inefficient and unfair resource distribution. To address this, we\nopen-sourced Fair-Synergy, an algorithmic framework that utilizes the concave\nrelationship between the agents' accuracy and the system resources to ensure\nfair resource allocation across fleet intelligence. We extend traditional\nallocation approaches to encompass a multidimensional machine learning utility\nlandscape defined by model parameters, training data volume, and task\ncomplexity. We evaluate Fair-Synergy with advanced vision and language models\nsuch as BERT, VGG16, MobileNet, and ResNets on datasets including MNIST,\nCIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, BDD, and GLUE. We demonstrate that Fair-Synergy\noutperforms standard benchmarks by up to 25% in multi-agent inference and 11%\nin multi-agent learning settings.

We propose Robult, a scalable framework\ndesigned to mitigate these challenges by preserving modality-specific\ninformation and leveraging redundancy through a novel information-theoretic\napproach. Robult optimizes two core objectives: (1) a soft Positive-Unlabeled\n(PU) contrastive loss that maximizes task-relevant feature alignment while\neffectively utilizing limited labeled data in semi-supervised settings, and (2)\na latent reconstruction loss that ensures unique modality-specific information\nis retained.

To control the policy entropy, a commonly used method is entropy\nregularization, which is adopted in various popular RL algorithms including\nPPO, SAC and A3C. Although entropy regularization proves effective in robotic\nand games RL conventionally, studies found that it gives weak to no gains in\nLLM-RL training. In this work, we study the issues of entropy bonus in LLM-RL\nsetting. Specifically, we first argue that the conventional entropy\nregularization suffers from the LLM's extremely large response space and the\nsparsity of the optimal outputs. As a remedy, we propose AEnt, an entropy\ncontrol method that utilizes a new clamped entropy bonus with an automatically\nadjusted coefficient. The clamped entropy is evaluated with the re-normalized\npolicy defined on certain smaller token space, which encourages exploration\nwithin a more compact response set. In addition, the algorithm automatically\nadjusts entropy coefficient according to the clamped entropy value, effectively\ncontrolling the entropy-induced bias while leveraging the entropy's benefits.\nAEnt is tested in math-reasoning tasks under different base models and\ndatasets, and it is observed that AEnt outperforms the baselines consistently\nacross multiple benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 LLM-RL \ud6c8\ub828\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \uc81c\uc5b4\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uace0 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \uc81c\uc5b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 AEnt\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "RL \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc740 \uc801\uc808\ud55c \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \uc81c\uc5b4\uc5d0 \ub2ec\ub824 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 LLM-RL \ud6c8\ub828\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc\uac00 \ubbf8\uc57d\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "AEnt\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9 \uc870\uc815\ub41c \uacc4\uc218\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud074\ub7a8\ud504 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \ubcf4\ub108\uc2a4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \uc81c\uc5b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ud2b9\uc815 \uc791\uc740 \ud1a0\ud070 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\uc758\ub41c \uc7ac\uc815\uaddc\ud654\ub41c \uc815\ucc45\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "AEnt\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uae30\ubcf8 \ubaa8\ub378\uacfc \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uc218\ud559\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\uad00\ub418\uac8c \uae30\uc900 \ubaa8\ub378\ub4e4\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "AEnt\ub294 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \uc720\ub3c4 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uc5b4\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c\uc758 \uc774\uc810\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "RL \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc801\uc808\ud55c \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \uc81c\uc5b4\ub294 \uadf8 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc5d0 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \uc815\ucc45 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c\ub97c \uc81c\uc5b4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \uc815\uaddc\ud654\ub85c, PPO, SAC \ubc0f A3C\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc778\uae30 \uc788\ub294 RL \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc5d0\uc11c \ucc44\ud0dd\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \uc815\uaddc\ud654\ub294 \ub85c\ubd07 \ubc0f \uac8c\uc784 RL\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc785\uc99d\ub418\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0 \ub530\ub974\uba74 LLM-RL \ud6c8\ub828\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc57d\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uac70\uc758 \uc774\ub4dd\uc774 \uc5c6\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 LLM-RL \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \ubcf4\ub108\uc2a4\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \uc815\uaddc\ud654\uac00 LLM\uc758 \uadf9\ub3c4\ub85c \ud070 \uc751\ub2f5 \uacf5\uac04\uacfc \ucd5c\uc801 \ucd9c\ub825\uc758 \ud76c\uc18c\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc815\ub41c \uacc4\uc218\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud074\ub7a8\ud504 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \ubcf4\ub108\uc2a4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \uc81c\uc5b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 AEnt\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud074\ub7a8\ud504 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c\ub294 \ub354 \uc791\uc740 \ud1a0\ud070 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\uc758\ub41c \uc7ac\uc815\uaddc\ud654\ub41c \uc815\ucc45\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ub418\uba70, \ub354 \ubc00\uc811\ud55c \uc751\ub2f5 \uc9d1\ud569 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \uc7a5\ub824\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uc774 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \ud074\ub7a8\ud504 \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \uac12\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \uacc4\uc218\ub97c \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c \uc720\ub3c4 \ud3b8\ud5a5\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uc5b4\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc5d4\ud2b8\ub85c\ud53c\uc758 \uc774\uc810\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.
