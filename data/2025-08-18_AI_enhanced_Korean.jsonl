As a method to overcome these problems, ensemble, commonly known as\nmodel combining, is being extensively used in the field of machine learning.\nAmong ensemble learning methods, voting ensembles have been studied with\nvarious weighting methods, showing performance improvements. However, the\nexisting methods that reflect the pre-information of classifiers in weights\nconsider only one evaluation criterion, which limits the reflection of various\ninformation that should be considered in a model realistically. Therefore, this\npaper proposes a method of making decisions considering various information\nthrough cooperative games in multi-criteria situations. Using this method,\nvarious types of information known beforehand in classifiers can be\nsimultaneously considered and reflected, leading to appropriate weight\ndistribution and performance improvement. The machine learning algorithms were\napplied to the Open-ML-CC18 dataset and compared with existing ensemble\nweighting methods. The experimental results showed superior performance\ncompared to other weighting methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uace0\ub824\ud55c \uacb0\uc815 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uba38\uc2e0\ub7ec\ub2dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "AI \uae30\uc220\uc774 \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc624\ubc84\ud53c\ud305/\uc5b8\ub354\ud53c\ud305, \ud074\ub798\uc2a4 \ubd88\uade0\ud615 \ub4f1 \ud574\uacb0\ud574\uc57c \ud560 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ud55c\uacc4\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud611\ub825 \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e4\uc911 \uae30\uc900 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uace0\ub824\ud558\uc5ec \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ub0b4\ub9ac\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uae30\uc874 \uc559\uc0c1\ube14 \uac00\uc911\uce58 \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud574 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc815\ubcf4\uc758 \uc801\uc808\ud55c \ubc18\uc601\uacfc \uc131\ub2a5 \uac1c\uc120\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc81c4\ucc28 \uc0b0\uc5c5\ud601\uba85 \uc774\ud6c4 AI \uae30\uc220\uc740 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc624\ubc84\ud53c\ud305/\uc5b8\ub354\ud53c\ud305, \ud074\ub798\uc2a4 \ubd88\uade0\ud615, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud2b9\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \ud45c\ud604\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4(\uac00\uc124 \uacf5\uac04) \ub4f1 \uadf9\ubcf5\ud574\uc57c \ud560 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ud55c\uacc4\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c \uc559\uc0c1\ube14(\ubaa8\ub378 \uacb0\ud569\uc73c\ub85c \ub110\ub9ac \uc54c\ub824\uc9d0)\uc774 \uba38\uc2e0\ub7ec\ub2dd \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud558\uac8c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc559\uc0c1\ube14 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\ubc95 \uc911 \ud22c\ud45c \uc559\uc0c1\ube14\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uac00\uc911\uce58 \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c \uc5f0\uad6c\ub418\uc5b4 \uc131\ub2a5 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ubd84\ub958\uae30\uc758 \uc0ac\uc804 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uac00\uc911\uce58\uc5d0 \ubc18\uc601\ud558\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ud558\ub098\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00 \uae30\uc900\ub9cc\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uace0\ub824\ud574\uc57c \ud560 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ubc18\uc601\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud55c\uacc4\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \uae30\uc900 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c \ud611\ub825 \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uace0\ub824\ud55c \uacb0\uc815 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubd84\ub958\uae30\uc5d0\uc11c \ubbf8\ub9ac \uc54c\ub824\uc9c4 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc720\ud615\uc758 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uace0\ub824\ud558\uace0 \ubc18\uc601\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc801\uc808\ud55c \uac00\uc911\uce58 \ubd84\ubc30\uc640 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uc774\ub04c\uc5b4\ub0bc \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uba38\uc2e0\ub7ec\ub2dd \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 Open-ML-CC18 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uace0 \uae30\uc874 \uc559\uc0c1\ube14 \uac00\uc911\uce58 \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub2e4\ub978 \uac00\uc911\uce58 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4."}}

To counter these challenges, we propose MCP-Guard, a robust, layered\ndefense architecture designed for LLM--tool interactions. MCP-Guard employs a\nthree-stage detection pipeline that balances efficiency with accuracy: it\nprogresses from lightweight static scanning for overt threats and a deep neural\ndetector for semantic attacks, to our fine-tuned E5-based model achieves\n(96.01) accuracy in identifying adversarial prompts.

Although first-order rules are commonly used in ASPIC+ examples, most\nexisting approaches to reason over rule-based argumentation only support\npropositional rules. To enable reasoning over first-order instances, a\npreliminary grounding step is required. As groundings can lead to an\nexponential increase in the size of the input theories, intelligent procedures\nare needed. However, there is a lack of dedicated solutions for ASPIC+.\nTherefore, we propose an intelligent grounding procedure that keeps the size of\nthe grounding manageable while preserving the correctness of the reasoning\nprocess.

In response, the use of synthetic data for pretraining has emerged\nas a promising paradigm for pushing the frontier of performance. Despite this,\nthe factors affecting synthetic data quality remain poorly understood. In this\nwork, we introduce BeyondWeb, a synthetic data generation framework that\nproduces high-quality synthetic data for pretraining. BeyondWeb significantly\nextends the capabilities of traditional web-scale datasets, outperforming\nstate-of-the-art synthetic pretraining datasets such as Cosmopedia and\nNemotron-CC's high-quality synthetic subset (Nemotron-Synth) by up to 5.1\npercentage points (pp) and 2.6pp, respectively, when averaged across a suite of\n14 benchmark evaluations. It delivers up to 7.7x faster training than open web\ndata and 2.7x faster than Nemotron-Synth. Remarkably, a 3B model trained for\n180B tokens on BeyondWeb outperforms an 8B model trained for the same token\nbudget on Cosmopedia. We also present several insights from BeyondWeb on\nsynthetic data for pretraining: what drives its benefits, which data to\nrephrase and how, and the impact of model size and family on data quality.\nOverall, our work shows that there's no silver bullet for generating\nhigh-quality synthetic pretraining data.

This paper presents, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive\nhardware study of CSIDH, establishing a performance baseline with a unified\narchitecture on both field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and\napplication-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) platforms. The architecture\nfeatures a top-level finite state machine (FSM) that orchestrates a deeply\npipelined arithmetic logic unit (ALU) to accelerate the underlying 512-bit\nfinite field operations. The ALU employs a parallelized schoolbook multiplier,\ncompleting a 512$\\times$512-bit multiplication in 22 clock cycles and enabling\na full Montgomery modular multiplication in 87 cycles. The constant-time\nCSIDH-512 design requires $1.03\\times10^{8}$ clock cycles per key generation.\nWhen implemented on a Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ FPGA, the architecture achieves a\n200 MHz clock frequency, corresponding to a 515 ms latency. For ASIC\nimplementation in a 180nm process, the design requires $1.065\\times10^{8}$\nclock cycles and achieves a \\textasciitilde 180 MHz frequency, resulting in a\nkey generation latency of 591 ms.

In such settings, algorithmic recourse aims to provide individuals\nwith actionable and minimally costly steps to reverse unfavorable AI-driven\ndecisions. While existing research predominantly focuses on single-individual\n(i.e., seeker) and single-model (i.e., provider) scenarios, real-world\napplications often involve multiple interacting stakeholders. Optimizing\noutcomes for seekers under an individual welfare approach overlooks the\ninherently multi-agent nature of real-world systems, where individuals interact\nand compete for limited resources. To address this, we introduce a novel\nframework for multi-agent algorithmic recourse that accounts for multiple\nrecourse seekers and recourse providers. We model this many-to-many interaction\nas a capacitated weighted bipartite matching problem, where matches are guided\nby both recourse cost and provider capacity. Edge weights, reflecting recourse\ncosts, are optimized for social welfare while quantifying the welfare gap\nbetween individual welfare and this collectively feasible outcome. We propose a\nthree-layer optimization framework: (1) basic capacitated matching, (2) optimal\ncapacity redistribution to minimize the welfare gap, and (3) cost-aware\noptimization balancing welfare maximization with capacity adjustment costs.\nExperimental validation on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrates that\nour framework enables the many-to-many algorithmic recourse to achieve\nnear-optimal welfare with minimum modification in system settings.

They are often pretrained on large corpora, and openly shared\non a model platform, such as HuggingFace. Users can then build up AI\napplications, e.g., generating media contents, by adopting pretrained T2I\nmodels and fine-tuning them on the target dataset. While public pretrained T2I\nmodels facilitate the democratization of the models, users face a new\nchallenge: which model can be best fine-tuned based on the target data domain?\nModel selection is well addressed in classification tasks, but little is known\nin (pretrained) T2I models and their performance indication on the target\ndomain. In this paper, we propose the first model selection framework, M&C,\nwhich enables users to efficiently choose a pretrained T2I model from a model\nplatform without exhaustively fine-tuning them all on the target dataset. The\ncore of M&C is a matching graph, which consists of: (i) nodes of available\nmodels and profiled datasets, and (ii) edges of model-data and data-data pairs\ncapturing the fine-tuning performance and data similarity, respectively. We\nthen build a model that, based on the inputs of model/data feature, and,\ncritically, the graph embedding feature, extracted from the matching graph,\npredicts the model achieving the best quality after fine-tuning for the target\ndomain.

HEIR aims\nto support all mainstream techniques in homomorphic encryption, integrate with\nall major software libraries and hardware accelerators, and advance the field\nby providing a platform for research and benchmarking. Built on the MLIR\ncompiler framework, HEIR introduces HE-specific abstraction layers at which\nexisting optimizations and new research ideas may be easily implemented.\nAlthough many HE optimization techniques have been proposed, it remains\ndifficult to combine or compare them effectively. HEIR provides a means to\neffectively explore the space of HE optimizations. HEIR addresses the entire HE\nstack and includes support for various frontends, including Python. The\ncontribution of this work includes: (1) We introduce HEIR as a framework for\nbuilding HE compilers. (2) We validate HEIR's design by porting a large\nfraction of the HE literature to HEIR, and we argue that HEIR can tackle more\ncomplicated and diverse programs than prior literature. (3) We provide evidence\nthat HEIR is emerging as the de facto HE compiler for academic research and\nindustry development.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub3d9\ud615 \uc554\ud638 \ucef4\ud30c\uc77c\ub7ec\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc778 \ub3d9\ud615 \uc554\ud638 \uc911\uac04 \ud45c\ud604(HEIR)\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "HEIR\ub294 \ub3d9\ud615 \uc554\ud638\uc758 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc8fc\uc694 \uae30\uc220\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uace0, \uc8fc\uc694 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4 \ub77c\uc774\ube0c\ub7ec\ub9ac \ubc0f \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4 \uac00\uc18d\uae30\uc640 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uba70, \uc5f0\uad6c \ubc0f \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud0b9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uac1c\ubc1c\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "method": "HEIR\ub294 MLIR \ucef4\ud30c\uc77c\ub7ec \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c \uc704\uc5d0 \uad6c\ucd95\ub418\uba70, \uae30\uc874 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubc0f \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc5f0\uad6c \uc544\uc774\ub514\uc5b4\ub97c \uc27d\uac8c \uad6c\ud604\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 HE \uc804\uc6a9 \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654 \uacc4\uce35\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "HEIR\ub294 HE \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud0d0\uc0c9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc218\ub2e8\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, Python\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud504\ub860\ud2b8\uc5d4\ub4dc\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uc5ec \uc804\uccb4 HE \uc2a4\ud0dd\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8ec\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \uae30\uc5ec\uc5d0\ub294 HE \ucef4\ud30c\uc77c\ub7ec\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c\uc11c\uc758 HEIR \ub3c4\uc785, HEIR\uc758 \ub514\uc790\uc778 \uac80\uc99d, HEIR\uac00 \ud559\uc220 \uc5f0\uad6c \ubc0f \uc0b0\uc5c5 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0ac\uc2e4\uc0c1 \ub3d9\ud615 \uc554\ud638 \ucef4\ud30c\uc77c\ub7ec\ub85c \ub5a0\uc624\ub974\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uc99d\uac70 \uc81c\uacf5\uc774 \ud3ec\ud568\ub41c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub3d9\ud615 \uc554\ud638 \ucef4\ud30c\uc77c\ub7ec\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc778 \ub3d9\ud615 \uc554\ud638 \uc911\uac04 \ud45c\ud604(HEIR)\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

This work\nintroduces TAPA (Training-free Adaptation of Programmatic Agents), a novel\nframework that positions large language models (LLMs) as intelligent moderators\nof the symbolic action space. Unlike prior programmatic agents that typically\ngenerate a monolithic policy program or rely on fixed symbolic action sets,\nTAPA synthesizes and adapts modular programs for individual high-level actions,\nreferred to as logical primitives. By decoupling strategic intent from\nexecution, TAPA enables meta-agents to operate over an abstract, interpretable\naction space while the LLM dynamically generates, composes, and refines\nsymbolic programs tailored to each primitive. Extensive experiments across\ncybersecurity and swarm intelligence domains validate TAPA's effectiveness. In\nautonomous DDoS defense scenarios, TAPA achieves 77.7% network uptime while\nmaintaining near-perfect detection accuracy in unknown dynamic environments. In\nswarm intelligence formation control under environmental and adversarial\ndisturbances, TAPA consistently preserves consensus at runtime where baseline\nmethods fail completely.

To achieve this,\nexperience-demanding objective parameter adjustment and computationally\nexpensive inverse optimization are performed iteratively. Extensive efforts\nhave been made to automatically adjust objective parameters, but the most\ntime-consuming component, i.e., inverse optimization, still relies heavily on\ntheory-driven approaches. We propose a data-driven inverse optimizer and\nintegrate it into a PPO-based automatic treatment planning framework to\nautomatically generate high-quality plans within a clinical acceptable planning\ntime. The inverse optimizer is a L2O method that predicts update steps by\nlearning from the task-specific data distribution. For the first time, we\nintegrate techniques designed for long-context processing, originally developed\nfor LLMs, into a Transformer-based L2O framework to address the scalability\nissue of existing L2O methods. The PPO framework functions as an outer-loop\nvirtual planner, autonomously adjusting objective parameters through a policy\nnetwork, and the dose predictor is used to initialize objective parameters. The\ninner-loop L2O inverse optimizer computes machine-deliverable MU values based\non objectives refined by the PPO policy network. 97 patients are collected in\nthis study, and compared with L-BFGSB, our L2O-based inverse optimizer improves\nthe effectiveness and efficiency by 22.97% and 36.41%, respectively. In\nconjunction with the PPO-based learned virtual planner, plans generated by our\nframework within an average of 2.55 hours show improved or comparable OAR\nsparing with superior target coverage for patients with different prescription\ndose levels, number of target volumes, beam angles, etc., compared with\nhuman-generated plans.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 H&N \uc554\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc591\uc131\uc790 PBS \uce58\ub8cc \uacc4\ud68d\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ub2e4\uc218\uc758 \uc0c1\ucda9\ub418\ub294 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc5ed\ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "H&N\uc554\uc758 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a4 PBS \uce58\ub8cc \uacc4\ud68d\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc218\uc758 \uc0c1\ucda9\ub418\ub294 \ubaa9\ud45c\uac00 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\uc5ec \uc778\uac04 \uacc4\ud68d\uc790\uac00 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc784\uc0c1 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uade0\ud615 \uc788\uac8c \ub9cc\uc871\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ub178\ub825\uc744 \uae30\uc6b8\uc5ec\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc5ed\ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 PPO \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc790\ub3d9 \uce58\ub8cc \uacc4\ud68d \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc784\uc0c1\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\uc815\ub41c \uacc4\ud68d \uc2dc\uac04 \ub0b4\uc5d0 \uace0\ud488\uc9c8\uc758 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "97\uba85\uc758 \ud658\uc790\ub97c \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c, L-BFGSB\uc640 \ube44\uad50\ud588\uc744 \ub54c L2O \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc5ed\ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uae30\ubc95\uc740 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131 22.97%, \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 36.41%\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "PPO \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \uac00\uc0c1 \uacc4\ud68d\uc790\uc640 \ud568\uaed8 \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \uacc4\ud68d\uc740 \ud3c9\uade0 2.55\uc2dc\uac04 \ub0b4\uc5d0 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc9c0\uba70, \uc778\uac04 \uc0dd\uc131 \uacc4\ud68d\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ucc98\ubc29 \uc6a9\ub7c9, \ubaa9\ud45c \ubd80\ud53c \uc218, \ube54 \uac01\ub3c4 \ub4f1\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub41c \ubaa9\ud45c \ubbfc\uac10\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "H&N \uc554\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc591\uc131\uc790 PBS \uce58\ub8cc \uacc4\ud68d\uc740 \ub2e4\uc218\uc758 \uc0c1\ucda9\ub418\ub294 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc5b4, \uacc4\ud68d \uc911 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc784\uc0c1 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uade0\ud615 \uc788\uac8c \ub9cc\uc871\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc778\uac04 \uacc4\ud68d\uc790\uac00 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ub178\ub825\uc744 \uae30\uc6b8\uc5ec\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uacbd\ud5d8\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ubaa9\ud45c \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \uc870\uc815\uacfc \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub4dc\ub294 \uc5ed\ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uac00 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ud589\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubaa9\ud45c \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc815\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \ub178\ub825\uc774 \uc788\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uac00\uc7a5 \uc2dc\uac04\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \uc18c\uc694\ub418\ub294 \uad6c\uc131 \uc694\uc18c\uc778 \uc5ed\ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub294 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc774\ub860 \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc5d0 \ud06c\uac8c \uc758\uc874\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18 \uc5ed\ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uae30\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c PPO \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc790\ub3d9 \uce58\ub8cc \uacc4\ud68d \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc784\uc0c1\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uacc4\ud68d \uc2dc\uac04 \ub0b4\uc5d0 \uace0\ud488\uc9c8\uc758 \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \uc790\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5ed\ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uae30\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5 \ud2b9\uc815 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc5d0\uc11c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uc5ec \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub97c \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 L2O \ubc29\ubc95\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucc98\uc74c\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uae30\uc874 L2O \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ud655\uc7a5\uc131 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 LLM\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc6d0\ub798 \uac1c\ubc1c\ub41c \uae38\uac8c \ucc98\ub9ac\ub418\ub294 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uae30\uc220\uc744 Transformer \uae30\ubc18\uc758 L2O \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

To address this issue, we introduce CURE\n(Critical-token-gUided Re concatenation for Entropy-collapse prevention), a\ntwo-stage framework that balances exploration and exploitation. Specifically,\nin the first stage, to deliberately steer the model toward novel yet coherent\ncontexts, we re-generate at high-entropy critical tokens and jointly optimize\nthe original and the branched trajectories. The further comparison with vanilla\nDAPO shows that the regeneration process achieves a better performance on math\nreasoning tasks while sustaining a high-level entropy degree for exploration.\nIn the second stage, we continue training with static initial-state sampling by\nDAPO, intentionally placing the model in a familiar state to gradually\nstrengthen exploitation. Extensive experiments on Qwen-2.5-Math-7B show that,\ncompared to other RLVR methods, CURE achieves a 5% performance gain across six\nmath benchmarks, establishing state-of-the-art performance in both entropy and\naccuracy. A series of experiments further validate the effectiveness of our\napproach.

Ships, as\ncritical assets, possess highly specialized and interconnected network\ninfrastructures, where their legacy systems and operational constraints further\nexacerbate their vulnerability to cyberattacks. To better understand this\nevolving threat landscape, we propose the use of cyber-deception techniques and\nin particular honeynets, as a means to gather valuable insights into ongoing\nattack campaigns targeting the maritime sector.\n  In this paper we present Salty Seagull, a honeynet conceived to simulate a\nVSAT system for ships. This environment mimics the operations of a functional\nVSAT system onboard and, at the same time, enables a user to interact with it\nthrough a Web dashboard and a CLI environment. Furthermore, based on existing\nvulnerabilities, we purposefully integrate them into our system to increase\nattacker engagement. We exposed our honeynet for 30 days to the Internet to\nassess its capability and measured the received interaction. Results show that\nwhile numerous generic attacks have been attempted, only one curious attacker\nwith knowledge of the nature of the system and its vulnerabilities managed to\naccess it, without however exploring its full potential.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ud574\uc591 \uc0b0\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \uc704\ud611\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c,

More specifically, we study\ntwo prominent alternatives to the standard notion of admissibility from\nabstract argumentation, namely strong and weak admissibility, and introduce the\nrespective preferred, complete and grounded semantics for general (sometimes\ncalled non-flat) ABA. To do so, we use abstract bipolar set-based argumentation\nframeworks (BSAFs) as formal playground since they concisely capture the\nrelations between assumptions and are expressive enough to represent general\nnon-flat ABA frameworks, as recently shown. While weak admissibility has been\nrecently investigated for a restricted fragment of ABA in which assumptions\ncannot be derived (flat ABA), strong admissibility has not been investigated\nfor ABA so far. We introduce strong admissibility for ABA and investigate\ndesirable properties. We furthermore extend the recent investigations of weak\nadmissibility in the flat ABA fragment to the non-flat case. We show that the\ncentral modularization property is maintained under classical, strong, and weak\nadmissibility. We also show that strong and weakly admissible semantics in\nnon-flat ABA share some of the shortcomings of standard admissible semantics\nand discuss ways to address these.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uac00\uc815 \uae30\ubc18 \ub17c\uc99d\uc758 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0\uc11c \ud5c8\uc6a9\uc131 \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uc5ec \uac15\ud55c \ud5c8\uc6a9\uc131\uacfc \uc57d\ud55c \ud5c8\uc6a9\uc131\uc758 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \ub300\uc548\uc744 \ub17c\uc758\ud558\uace0, \uc77c\ubc18 ABA\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc120\ud638, \uc644\uc804 \ubc0f \uae30\ucd08 \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uac00\uc815 \uae30\ubc18 \ub17c\uc99d\uc5d0\uc11c \ud5c8\uc6a9\uc131 \uac1c\ub150\uc758 \ud655\uc7a5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uac15\ud55c \ud5c8\uc6a9\uc131\uacfc \uc57d\ud55c \ud5c8\uc6a9\uc131\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\ucd94\uc0c1 \uc30d\ubc29\ud5a5 \uc9d1\ud569 \uae30\ubc18 \ub17c\uc99d \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c(BSAFs)\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc77c\ubc18 \ube44\ud3c9\uba74 ABA\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uac15\ud55c \ud5c8\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 ABA\uc5d0 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0, \uc774\uc758 \ubc14\ub78c\uc9c1\ud55c \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uba70, \uc57d\ud55c \ud5c8\uc6a9\uc131\uc758 \ucd5c\uadfc \uc870\uc0ac \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ube44\ud3c9\uba74 ABA\uc5d0 \ud655\ub300 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uac15\ud55c \ud5c8\uc6a9\uc131\uacfc \uc57d\ud55c \ud5c8\uc6a9\uc131\uc774 \ube44\ud3c9\uba74 ABA\uc5d0\uc11c \ud45c\uc900 \ud5c8\uc6a9 \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc758 \ub2e8\uc810\uc744 \uacf5\uc720\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ub17c\uc758\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uac00\uc815 \uae30\ubc18 \ub17c\uc99d(ABA) \ub9e5\ub77d\uc5d0\uc11c \ud5c8\uc6a9\uc131 \uac1c\ub150\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc870\uc0ac\ub97c \ud655\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ucd94\uc0c1 \ub17c\uc99d\uc5d0\uc11c \ud45c\uc900 \ud5c8\uc6a9\uc131 \uac1c\ub150\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \ub300\uc548\uc778 \uac15\ud55c \ud5c8\uc6a9\uc131\uacfc \uc57d\ud55c \ud5c8\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uba70, \uc77c\ubc18(\ub54c\ub54c\ub85c \ube44\ud3c9\uba74\uc774\ub77c \ubd88\ub9ac\ub294) ABA\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uac01\uac01\uc758 \uc120\ud638, \uc644\uc804 \ubc0f \uae30\ucd08 \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac00\uc815 \uac04\uc758 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uac04\uacb0\ud558\uac8c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uace0 \ucd5c\uadfc\uc5d0 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc9c4 \ubc14\uc640 \uac19\uc774 \uc77c\ubc18 \ube44\ud3c9\uba74 ABA \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud45c\ud604\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc744 \ub9cc\ud07c \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \ud45c\ud604\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \ucd94\uc0c1 \uc30d\ubc29\ud5a5 \uc9d1\ud569 \uae30\ubc18 \ub17c\uc99d \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c(BSAFs)\ub97c \uacf5\uc2dd\uc801\uc778 \ub180\uc774\ud130\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc57d\ud55c \ud5c8\uc6a9\uc131\uc740 \ucd5c\uadfc\uc5d0 \uac00\uc815\uc774 \ud30c\uc0dd\ub420 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 ABA\uc758 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ubd80\ubd84(\ud3c9\uba74 ABA)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc870\uc0ac\ub418\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uac15\ud55c \ud5c8\uc6a9\uc131\uc740 \uc9c0\uae08\uae4c\uc9c0 ABA\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uc870\uc0ac\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 ABA\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac15\ud55c \ud5c8\uc6a9\uc131\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0 \ubc14\ub78c\uc9c1\ud55c \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \ud3c9\uba74 ABA \ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \uc57d\ud55c \ud5c8\uc6a9\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucd5c\uadfc \uc870\uc0ac\ub97c \ube44\ud3c9\uba74 \uacbd\uc6b0\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc911\uc2ec \ubaa8\ub4c8\ud654 \ud2b9\uc131\uc774 \uace0\uc804\uc801\uc778, \uac15\ud55c \ubc0f \uc57d\ud55c \ud5c8\uc6a9\uc131 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc720\uc9c0\ub428\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ube44\ud3c9\uba74 ABA\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ud55c \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uacfc \uc57d\ud55c \ud5c8\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc774 \ud45c\uc900 \ud5c8\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc758\ubbf8\ub860\uc758 \uc77c\ubd80 \ub2e8\uc810\uc744 \uacf5\uc720\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ub17c\uc758\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Due to the lack of fine-grained\nbehavior-level annotations, detecting specific behavior-level anomalies within\nuser behavior sequences is challenging. Unsupervised methods face high false\npositive rates and miss rates due to the inherent ambiguity between normal and\nanomalous behaviors. In this work, we instead introduce weak labels of behavior\nsequences, which have lower annotation costs, i.e., the training labels\n(anomalous or normal) are at sequence-level instead of behavior-level, to\nenhance the detection capability for behavior-level anomalies by learning\ndiscriminative features. To achieve this, we propose a novel framework called\nRobust Multi-sphere Learning (RMSL). RMSL uses multiple hyper-spheres to\nrepresent the normal patterns of behaviors. Initially, a one-class classifier\nis constructed as a good anomaly-supervision-free starting point.

Under review", "summary": "Conformal prediction is a popular uncertainty quantification method that\naugments a base predictor with prediction sets with statistically valid\ncoverage guarantees. However, current methods are often computationally\nexpensive and data-intensive, as they require constructing an uncertainty model\nbefore calibration. Moreover, existing approaches typically represent the\nprediction sets with intervals, which limits their ability to capture\ndependencies in multi-dimensional outputs. We address these limitations by\nintroducing zono-conformal prediction, a novel approach inspired by interval\npredictor models and reachset-conformant identification that constructs\nprediction zonotopes with assured coverage. By placing zonotopic uncertainty\nsets directly into the model of the base predictor, zono-conformal predictors\ncan be identified via a single, data-efficient linear program. While we can\napply zono-conformal prediction to arbitrary nonlinear base predictors, we\nfocus on feed-forward neural networks in this work.

However, mistakes in complex theoretical analysis or subtle\nimplementation errors may undermine its practical guarantee. To address this,\nauditing is crucial to confirm that LDP protocols truly protect user data.\nHowever, existing auditing methods, though, mainly target machine learning and\nfederated learning tasks based on centralized differentially privacy (DP), with\nlimited attention to LDP. Moreover, the few studies on LDP auditing focus\nsolely on simple frequency estimation task for discrete data, leaving\ncorrelated key-value data - which requires both discrete frequency estimation\nfor keys and continuous mean estimation for values - unexplored.\n  To bridge this gap, we propose KV-Auditor, a framework for auditing LDP-based\nkey-value estimation mechanisms by estimating their empirical privacy lower\nbounds. Rather than traditional LDP auditing methods that relies on binary\noutput predictions, KV-Auditor estimates this lower bound by analyzing\nunbounded output distributions, supporting continuous data. Specifically, we\nclassify state-of-the-art LDP key-value mechanisms into interactive and\nnon-interactive types. For non-interactive mechanisms, we propose horizontal\nKV-Auditor for small domains with sufficient samples and vertical KV-Auditor\nfor large domains with limited samples. For interactive mechanisms, we design a\nsegmentation strategy to capture incremental privacy leakage across iterations.\nFinally, we perform extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of our\napproach, offering insights for optimizing LDP-based key-value estimators.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 LDP \uae30\ubc18 \ud0a4-\uac12 \ucd94\uc815 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uac10\uc0ac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 KV-Auditor\ub77c\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubcf4\ud638\ub97c \ud655\uc778\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LDP\uc758 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uacbd\uacc4\ub294 \uac1c\uc778\uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc2e4\uc81c \uad6c\ud604 \uc2dc \uc2e4\uc218\uac00 \uc788\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\ubbc0\ub85c \uac10\uc0ac\uac00 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "KV-Auditor\ub294 \ubb34\uc81c\ud55c \ucd9c\ub825 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc5ec LDP\uc758 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \ud558\ud55c\uc744 \ucd94\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \ub300\ud654\ud615 \ubc0f \ube44\ub300\ud654\ud615 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucdb0 \uc124\uacc4\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 KV-Auditor\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uba70 LDP \uae30\ubc18 \ud0a4-\uac12 \ucd94\uc815\uae30 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "KV-Auditor\ub294 LDP \uac10\uc0ac\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc7a5\uc744 \uc5f4\uba70, \uc5f0\uc18d \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc218\uc9d1 \uae30\ubc18 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc758 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638\ub97c \uc704\ud574, \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc801 \ucc28\ubcc4\uc801 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638(LDP)\ub294 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc190\uc2e4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uacbd\uacc4\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ub110\ub9ac \ucc44\ud0dd\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ubd84\uc11d\uc758 \uc2e4\uc218\ub098 \ubbf8\uc138\ud55c \uad6c\ud604 \uc624\ub958\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uc800\ud574\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 LDP \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc774 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc2e4\uc81c\ub85c \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ud655\uc778\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uac10\uc0ac\uac00 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uae30\uc874 \uac10\uc0ac \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc8fc\ub85c \uc911\uc559 \uc9d1\uc911\uc2dd \ucc28\ubcc4\uc801 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638(DP)\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \uae30\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc0f \uc5f0\ud569 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uba70 LDP\uc5d0\ub294 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uad00\uc2ec\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c LDP \uac10\uc0ac\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uba87\uba87 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc774\uc0b0 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \ube48\ub3c4 \ucd94\uc815 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\ub9cc \uc9d1\uc911\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ud0a4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc774\uc0b0 \ube48\ub3c4 \ucd94\uc815\uacfc \uac12\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5f0\uc18d \ud3c9\uade0 \ucd94\uc815\uc774 \ubaa8\ub450 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc0c1\uad00\ub41c \ud0a4-\uac12 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub294 \ud0d0\uad6c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \ud574\uc18c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \uac1c\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638 \ud558\ud55c\uc744 \ucd94\uc815\ud558\uc5ec LDP \uae30\ubc18 \ud0a4-\uac12 \ucd94\uc815 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uac10\uc0ac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c KV-Auditor\ub77c\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

To address such dynamic nature of KGs, several\ncontinual knowledge graph embedding (CKGE) methods have been developed to\nefficiently update KG embeddings to accommodate new facts while maintaining\nlearned knowledge. As KGs grow at different rates and scales in real-world\nscenarios, existing CKGE methods often fail to consider the varying scales of\nupdates and lack systematic evaluation throughout the entire update process. In\nthis paper, we propose SAGE, a scale-aware gradual evolution framework for\nCKGE. Specifically, SAGE firstly determine the embedding dimensions based on\nthe update scales and expand the embedding space accordingly. The Dynamic\nDistillation mechanism is further employed to balance the preservation of\nlearned knowledge and the incorporation of new facts. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on seven benchmarks, and the results show that SAGE consistently\noutperforms existing baselines, with a notable improvement of 1.38% in MRR,\n1.25% in H@1 and 1.6% in H@10. Furthermore, experiments comparing SAGE with\nmethods using fixed embedding dimensions show that SAGE achieves optimal\nperformance on every snapshot, demonstrating the importance of adaptive\nembedding dimensions in CKGE.

Existing surveys have predominantly focused on techniques for tracing\nLLM-generated content-namely, text watermarking-while a systematic exploration\nof methods for protecting the models themselves (i.e., model watermarking and\nmodel fingerprinting) remains absent. Moreover, the relationships and\ndistinctions among text watermarking, model watermarking, and model\nfingerprinting have not been comprehensively clarified. This work presents a\ncomprehensive survey of the current state of LLM copyright protection\ntechnologies, with a focus on model fingerprinting, covering the following\naspects: (1) clarifying the conceptual connection from text watermarking to\nmodel watermarking and fingerprinting, and adopting a unified terminology that\nincorporates model watermarking into the broader fingerprinting framework; (2)\nproviding an overview and comparison of diverse text watermarking techniques,\nhighlighting cases where such methods can function as model fingerprinting; (3)\nsystematically categorizing and comparing existing model fingerprinting\napproaches for LLM copyright protection; (4) presenting, for the first time,\ntechniques for fingerprint transfer and fingerprint removal; (5) summarizing\nevaluation metrics for model fingerprints, including effectiveness,\nharmlessness, robustness, stealthiness, and reliability; and (6) discussing\nopen challenges and future research directions. This survey aims to offer\nresearchers a thorough understanding of both text watermarking and model\nfingerprinting technologies in the era of LLMs, thereby fostering further\nadvances in protecting their intellectual property.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uc800\uc791\uad8c \ubcf4\ud638\uac00 \uc911\uc694\ud558\uba70, \uc774\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uae30\uc874 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc8fc\ub85c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud0b9 \uae30\ubc95\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucdc4\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ubaa8\ub378 \uc790\uccb4 \ubcf4\ud638\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc9c0\ubb38\ucc44\uc9d1\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd98 LLM \uc800\uc791\uad8c \ubcf4\ud638 \uae30\uc220\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \uc870\uc0ac\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uac1c\ubc1c \ube44\uc6a9\uacfc \ub3c5\uc810\uc801 \uac00\uce58, \uc624\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud560 \ub54c \uc800\uc791\uad8c \ubcf4\ud638\uac00 \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud0b9\uacfc \ubaa8\ub378 \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud0b9 \ubc0f \uc9c0\ubb38\ucc44\uc9d1 \uac04\uc758 \uac1c\ub150\uc801 \uc5f0\uacb0\uc744 \uba85\ud655\ud788 \ud558\uace0, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud0b9 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \uac1c\uad00\ud558\uba70, \uae30\uc874 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc9c0\ubb38\ucc44\uc9d1 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ub958 \ubc0f \ube44\uad50\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ucc44\ud0dd\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\ubaa8\ub378 \uc9c0\ubb38\ucc44\uc9d1\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uae30\uc220\uacfc \ud3c9\uac00 \uc9c0\ud45c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \ud5a5\ud6c4 \uc5f0\uad6c \ubc29\ud5a5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub17c\uc758\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc790\ub4e4\uc774 LLM \uc2dc\ub300\uc758 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud0b9 \ubc0f \ubaa8\ub378 \uc9c0\ubb38\ucc44\uc9d1 \uae30\uc220\uc744 \uc885\ud569\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\ud574\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ub3d5\uace0 \uc9c0\uc801 \uc7ac\uc0b0 \ubcf4\ud638\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc800\uc791\uad8c \ubcf4\ud638\ub294 \uadf8\ub4e4\uc758 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uac1c\ubc1c \ube44\uc6a9, \ub3c5\uc810\uc801 \uac00\uce58 \ubc0f \uc624\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud560 \ub54c \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc124\ubb38\uc870\uc0ac\ub294 \uc8fc\ub85c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud0b9\uacfc \uac19\uc740 LLM \uc0dd\uc131 \ucf58\ud150\uce20 \ucd94\uc801 \uae30\uc220\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \ubaa8\ub378 \uc790\uccb4\ub97c \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95(\uc989, \ubaa8\ub378 \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud0b9 \ubc0f \ubaa8\ub378 \uc9c0\ubb38\ucc44\uc9d1)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc740 \ubd80\uc871\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uac8c\ub2e4\uac00 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud0b9, \ubaa8\ub378 \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud0b9 \ubc0f \ubaa8\ub378 \uc9c0\ubb38\ucc44\uc9d1 \uac04\uc758 \uad00\uacc4\uc640 \uad6c\ubcc4\uc740 \ucca0\uc800\ud788 \uba85\ud655\ud788 \uc124\uba85\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc791\uc5c5\uc740 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc9c0\ubb38\ucc44\uc9d1\uc5d0 \uc911\uc810\uc744 \ub450\uace0 LLM \uc800\uc791\uad8c \ubcf4\ud638 \uae30\uc220\uc758 \ud604\uc7ac \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \uc870\uc0ac\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \ub2e4\uc74c\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uce21\uba74\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8f9\ub2c8\ub2e4: (1) \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud0b9\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa8\ub378 \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud0b9 \ubc0f \uc9c0\ubb38\ucc44\uc9d1\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \uac1c\ub150\uc801 \uc5f0\uacb0\uc744 \uba85\ud655\ud788 \ud558\uace0, \ubaa8\ub378 \uc6cc\ud130\ub9c8\ud0b9\uc744 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub113\uc740 \uc9c0\ubb38\ucc44\uc9d1 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \ud1b5\uc77c\ub41c \uc6a9\uc5b4\ub97c \ucc44\ud0dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4;

Recent studies have demonstrated that Reinforcement\nLearning (RL) can effectively enhance agents' performance in dynamic\ninteractive GUI environments. However, these methods face two key limitations:\n(1) they overlook the significant variation in difficulty across different GUI\ntasks by treating the entire training data as a uniform set, which hampers the\nagent's ability to adapt its learning process; and (2) most approaches collapse\ntask-specific nuances into a single, coarse reward, leaving the agent with a\nuniform signal that yields inefficient policy updates. To address these\nlimitations, we propose CRAFT-GUI, a curriculum learning framework based on\nGroup Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that explicitly accounts for the\nvarying difficulty across trajectories. To enable more fine-grained policy\noptimization, we design a reward function that combines simple rule-based\nsignals with model-judged evaluation, providing richer and more nuanced\nfeedback during training. Experimental results demonstrate that our method\nachieves significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art approaches,\noutperforming them by 5.6% on public benchmarks Android Control and 10.3% on\nour internal online benchmarks, respectively. These findings empirically\nvalidate the effectiveness of integrating reinforcement learning with\ncurriculum learning in GUI interaction tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 CRAFT-GUI\ub77c\ub294 \ucee4\ub9ac\ud058\ub7fc \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, GUI \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uadf8\ub798\ud53d \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4 \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub428\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uc791\uc5c5 \uc2e4\ud589\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc2dc\ub300\uac00 \uc5f4\ub9ac\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c CRAFT-GUI\ub77c\ub294 \ucee4\ub9ac\ud058\ub7fc \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc774\uc804\uc758 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\ubcf4\ub2e4 5.6%\uc640 10.3%\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uacfc \ucee4\ub9ac\ud058\ub7fc \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ud1b5\ud569\uc774 GUI \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc784\uc744 \uc2e4\uc99d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\uc99d\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc790\uc728 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uadf8\ub798\ud53d \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4(GUI) \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub2a5\uc219\ud574\uc9d0\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub41c \uc791\uc5c5 \uc2e4\ud589\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc2dc\ub300\uac00 \uc5f4\ub9ac\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc \uc5f0\uad6c\ub4e4\uc740 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc774 \ub3d9\uc801\uc778 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 GUI \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc694 \ud55c\uacc4\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4: (1) \uc804\uccb4 \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uade0\uc77c\ud55c \uc9d1\ud569\uc73c\ub85c \ucde8\uae09\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c GUI \uc791\uc5c5 \uac04\uc758 \ub09c\uc774\ub3c4 \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \uac04\uacfc\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5 \uacfc\uc815 \uc801\uc751 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc800\ud574\ud558\uace0; (2) \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \uc791\uc5c5\ubcc4 \ubbf8\uc138\ud55c \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \ub2e8\uc77c\ud55c \uac70\uce5c \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc815\ucc45 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \uc77c\uc73c\ud0a4\ub294 \uade0\uc77c\ud55c \uc2e0\ud638\ub97c \ub0a8\uae41\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uada4\uc801 \uac04 \ub09c\uc774\ub3c4\uc758 \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uace0\ub824\ud558\ub294 Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \ucee4\ub9ac\ud058\ub7fc \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 CRAFT-GUI\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc138\ubd84\ud654\ub41c \uc815\ucc45 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \uaddc\uce59 \uae30\ubc18 \uc2e0\ud638\uc640 \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uc5ec \ud6c8\ub828 \uc911 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud48d\ubd80\ud558\uace0 \uc138\ubc00\ud55c \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc774\uc804\uc758 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\ubcf4\ub2e4 5.6%\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \ub0b4\ubd80 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 10.3%\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uae30\ub85d\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc1c\uacac\ub4e4\uc740 GUI \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uacfc \ucee4\ub9ac\ud058\ub7fc \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \ud1b5\ud569\uc774 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc784\uc744 \uc2e4\uc99d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Typical SE constructions often allow\naccess-pattern leakage, revealing which encrypted records are retrieved in the\nserver's responses. All the known generic cryptanalyses assume either that the\nqueries are issued uniformly at random or that the attacker observes the\nsearch-pattern leakage. It remains unclear what can be reconstructed when using\nonly the access-pattern leakage and knowledge of the query distribution. In\nthis work, we focus on the cryptanalytic technique of frequency analysis in the\ncontext of leakage-abuse attacks on schemes that support encrypted range\nqueries. Frequency analysis matches the frequency of retrieval of an encrypted\nrecord with a plaintext value based on its probability of retrieval that\nfollows from the knowledge of the query distribution. We generalize this\nunderexplored cryptanalytic technique and introduce a generic attack framework\ncalled Leakage-Abuse via Matching (LAMA) that works even on high-dimensional\nencrypted data. We identify a parameterization of LAMA that brings frequency\nanalysis to its limit -- that is, we prove that there is no additional\nfrequency matching that an attacker can perform to refine the result.\nFurthermore, we show that our results hold for any class of convex queries, and\nnot just axis-aligned rectangles, which is the assumption in all other attacks\non range schemes. Using these results, we identify query distributions that\nmake frequency analysis challenging for the attacker and, thus, can act as a\nmitigation mechanism. Finally, we implement and benchmark LAMA and reconstruct,\nfor the first time, plaintext data from encrypted range queries spanning up to\nfour dimensions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740

Decision models to optimize inventory levels are one of the core\nelements of operations management. However, the capabilities of the LLM agent\nin making inventory decisions in uncertain contexts, as well as the\ndecision-making biases (e.g. framing effect, etc.) of the agent, remain largely\nunexplored. This prompts concerns regarding the capacity of LLM agents to\neffectively address real-world problems, as well as the potential implications\nof biases that may be present. To address this gap, we introduce AIM-Bench, a\nnovel benchmark designed to assess the decision-making behaviour of LLM agents\nin uncertain supply chain management scenarios through a diverse series of\ninventory replenishment experiments. Our results reveal that different LLMs\ntypically exhibit varying degrees of decision bias that are similar to those\nobserved in human beings. In addition, we explored strategies to mitigate the\npull-to-centre effect and the bullwhip effect, namely cognitive reflection and\nimplementation of information sharing.

Kinsy"], "title": "Activate Me!: Designing Efficient Activation Functions for Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning with Fully Homomorphic Encryption", "comment": null, "summary": "The growing adoption of machine learning in sensitive areas such as\nhealthcare and defense introduces significant privacy and security challenges.\nThese domains demand robust data protection, as models depend on large volumes\nof sensitive information for both training and inference. Fully Homomorphic\nEncryption (FHE) presents a compelling solution by enabling computations\ndirectly on encrypted data, maintaining confidentiality across the entire\nmachine learning workflow. However, FHE inherently supports only linear\noperations, making it difficult to implement non-linear activation functions,\nessential components of modern neural networks. This work focuses on designing,\nimplementing, and evaluating activation functions tailored for FHE-based\nmachine learning. We investigate two commonly used functions: the Square\nfunction and Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), using LeNet-5 and ResNet-20\narchitectures with the CKKS scheme from the OpenFHE library. For ReLU, we\nassess two methods: a conventional low-degree polynomial approximation and a\nnovel scheme-switching technique that securely evaluates ReLU under FHE\nconstraints. Our findings show that the Square function performs well in\nshallow networks like LeNet-5, achieving 99.4% accuracy with 128 seconds per\nimage. In contrast, deeper models like ResNet-20 benefit more from ReLU. The\npolynomial approximation yields 83.8% accuracy with 1,145 seconds per image,\nwhile our scheme-switching method improves accuracy to 89.8%, albeit with a\nlonger inference time of 1,697 seconds.

While numerous benchmarks (e.g., MMLU)\nand leaderboards (e.g., Chatbot Arena) have been proposed to help evolve the\ndevelopment of LLMs and MLLMs, most rely on static datasets or crowdsourced\ngeneral-domain prompts, often falling short of reflecting performance in\nreal-world applications. To bridge this critical gap, we present Inclusion\nArena, a live leaderboard that ranks models based on human feedback collected\ndirectly from AI-powered applications. Our platform integrates pairwise model\ncomparisons into natural user interactions, ensuring evaluations reflect\npractical usage scenarios. For robust model ranking, we employ the\nBradley-Terry model augmented with two key innovations: (1) Placement Matches,\na cold-start mechanism to quickly estimate initial ratings for newly integrated\nmodels, and (2) Proximity Sampling, an intelligent comparison strategy that\nprioritizes battles between models of similar capabilities to maximize\ninformation gain and enhance rating stability. Extensive empirical analyses and\nsimulations demonstrate that Inclusion Arena yields reliable and stable\nrankings, exhibits higher data transitivity compared to general crowdsourced\ndatasets, and significantly mitigates the risk of malicious manipulation.

Exploring New Paradigms in Assisting Classical Planners with Large Language Models", "comment": null, "summary": "Addressing large-scale planning problems has become one of the central\nchallenges in the planning community, deriving from the state-space explosion\ncaused by growing objects and actions. Recently, researchers have explored the\neffectiveness of leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate helpful\nactions and states to prune the search space. However, prior works have largely\noverlooked integrating LLMs with domain-specific knowledge to ensure valid\nplans. In this paper, we propose a novel LLM-assisted planner integrated with\nproblem decomposition, which first decomposes large planning problems into\nmultiple simpler sub-tasks. Then we explore two novel paradigms to utilize\nLLMs, i.e., LLM4Inspire and LLM4Predict, to assist problem decomposition, where\nLLM4Inspire provides heuristic guidance according to general knowledge and\nLLM4Predict employs domain-specific knowledge to infer intermediate conditions.\nWe empirically validate the effectiveness of our planner across multiple\ndomains, demonstrating the ability of search space partition when solving\nlarge-scale planning problems. The experimental results show that LLMs\neffectively locate feasible solutions when pruning the search space, where\ninfusing domain-specific knowledge into LLMs, i.e., LLM4Predict, holds\nparticular promise compared with LLM4Inspire, which offers general knowledge\nwithin LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 LLM\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uacc4\ud68d \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uacc4\ud68d\uc790 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \ubb38\uc81c \ubd84\ud574\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uac80\uc0c9 \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uacc4\ud68d \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uac80\uc0c9 \uacf5\uac04 \ucd95\uc18c \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubb38\uc81c \ubd84\ud574\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uacc4\ud68d \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc5ec\ub7ec \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \ud558\uc704 \uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ub204\uace0, LLM4Inspire\uc640 LLM4Predict\ub77c\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc5ec\ub7ec \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uacc4\ud68d\uc790\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfciveness\ub97c \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uc5ec \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uacc4\ud68d \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0 \uc2dc \uac80\uc0c9 \uacf5\uac04 \ubd84\ud560 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\ud654 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 LLM\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud560 \uacbd\uc6b0 \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158 \uac80\uc0c9\uc774 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc9c4\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uacc4\ud68d \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0\uc740 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uac1d\uccb4\uc640 \ud589\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uc0c1\ud0dc \uacf5\uac04 \ud3ed\ubc1c \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uacc4\ud68d \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ud2f0\uc758 \uc911\uc2ec \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc \uc5f0\uad6c\uc790\ub4e4\uc740 \uac80\uc0c9 \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \ucd95\uc18c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9\uacfc \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\uc804 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc720\ud6a8\ud55c \uacc4\ud68d\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 LLM\uacfc \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\ud654 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \uac04\uacfc\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c \ubd84\ud574\uc640 \ud1b5\ud569\ub41c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 LLM \uc9c0\uc6d0 \uacc4\ud68d\uc790\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uba3c\uc800 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uacc4\ud68d \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc5ec\ub7ec \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \ud558\uc704 \uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud55c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7f0 \ub2e4\uc74c \ubb38\uc81c \ubd84\ud574\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 LLM4Inspire\uc640 LLM4Predict\ub77c\ub294 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \ud0d0\uad6c\ud558\uba70, LLM4Inspire\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1 \uac00\uc774\ub4dc\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0 LLM4Predict\ub294 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\ud654 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc911\uac04 \uc870\uac74\uc744 \uc720\ucd94\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub3c4\uba54\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacc4\ud68d\uc790\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uc5ec \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uacc4\ud68d \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud560 \ub54c \uac80\uc0c9 \uacf5\uac04 \ubd84\ud560 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, LLM\uc774 \uac80\uc0c9 \uacf5\uac04\uc744 \ucd95\uc18c\ud560 \ub54c \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucc3e\uace0, \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ud2b9\ud654 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 LLM\uc5d0 \uc8fc\uc785\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ud2b9\ud788 \uc720\ub9dd\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4."}}

However, raw watch times are influenced by\nconfounding factors such as video duration, popularity, and individual user\nbehaviors, potentially distorting preference signals and resulting in biased\nrecommendation models. We propose a novel relative advantage debiasing\nframework that corrects watch time by comparing it to empirically derived\nreference distributions conditioned on user and item groups.

Compressive learning is a\nframework that enables efficient processing by using random, non-linear\nfeatures to project large-scale databases onto compact, information-preserving\nrepresentations whose dimensionality is independent of the number of samples\nand can be easily stored, transferred, and processed. These database-level\nsummaries are then used to decode parameters of interest from the underlying\ndata distribution without requiring access to the original samples, offering an\nefficient and privacy-friendly learning framework. However, both the encoding\nand decoding techniques are typically randomized and data-independent, failing\nto exploit the underlying structure of the data. In this work, we propose a\nframework that meta-learns both the encoding and decoding stages of compressive\nlearning methods by using neural networks that provide faster and more accurate\nsystems than the current state-of-the-art approaches.

Models for early\nforecasting of this information could be used for identifying health risks,\nsuggesting effective treatments, or optimizing resource allocation. To address\nthe challenge of predictive modeling using the limited information at the\nbeginning of a patient stay, we propose a multimodal system to fuse clinical\nnotes and tabular events captured in electronic health records.

Effective fashion recommendation systems are crucial for\nfiltering irrelevant items and suggesting suitable ones. However,\nsimultaneously addressing outfit compatibility and personalized recommendations\nremains a significant challenge, as these aspects are often treated\nindependently in existing studies, often overlooking the complex interactions\nbetween items and user preferences. This research introduces a new framework\nnamed FGAT, inspired by the HFGN model, which leverages graph neural networks\nand graph attention mechanisms to tackle this issue. The proposed framework\nconstructs a three-tier hierarchical graph of users, outfits, and items,\nintegrating visual and textual features to simultaneously model outfit\ncompatibility and user preferences. A graph attention mechanism dynamically\nweights node importance during representation propagation, enabling the capture\nof key interactions and generating precise representations for both user\npreferences and outfit compatibility. Evaluated on the POG dataset, FGAT\noutperforms baseline models such as HFGN, achieving improved results in\nprecision, HR, recall, NDCG, and accuracy.These results demonstrate that\ncombining multimodal visual-textual features with a hierarchical graph\nstructure and attention mechanisms significantly enhances the accuracy and\nefficiency of personalized fashion recommendation systems.",

In\nthis work, we focus on the setting of supervised learning and investigate the\ntheoretical foundations of PAR from optimization and statistical perspectives.\nFirst, we show that in the overparameterized regime, where the number of\nparameters exceeds the number of samples, every critical point of the\nPAR-regularized loss function exhibits a high degree of quantization. Second,\nwe derive closed-form proximal mappings for various (convex, quasi-convex, and\nnon-convex) PARs and show how to solve PAR-regularized problems using the\nproximal gradient method, its accelerated variant, and the Alternating\nDirection Method of Multipliers. Third, we study statistical guarantees of\nPAR-regularized linear regression problems; specifically, we can approximate\nclassical formulations of $\\ell_1$-, squared $\\ell_2$-, and nonconvex\nregularizations using PAR and obtain similar statistical guarantees with\nquantized solutions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ucabc\uac1c\uc9c4 \uc544\ud540 \uc815\uaddc\ud654(PAR)\uac00 \uac10\ub7c9\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc784\uc744 \uc774\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc774\uc0b0 \ub610\ub294 \uc591\uc790\ud654\ub41c \ubcc0\uc218\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\uc758 \ub3c4\uc804\uc131\uc744 \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 PAR\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uacfc\ub2e4\ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130\ud654\ub41c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c PAR \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \uc190\uc2e4 \ud568\uc218\uc758 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc810\uc740 \ub192\uc740 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uace0, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c PAR\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub2eb\ud78c \ud615\ud0dc\uc758 \uadfc\uc811 \ub9f5\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uba70, \uadfc\uc811 \uacbd\ub7c9\ubc95\uacfc \uadf8 \uac00\uc18d \ubcc0\ud615\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec PAR \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uace0, PAR\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uace0\uc804\uc801\uc778 $\u0014_1$, \uc81c\uacf1 $\u0014_2$, \ube44\ubcfc\ub85d \uc815\uaddc\ud654\uc758 \uadfc\uc0ac\uce58\ub97c \uc5bb\uc73c\uba70, \uc591\uc790\ud654\ub41c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uc5bb\ub294\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 supervised learning\uc5d0\uc11c PAR\uc758 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uba70 \uc815\ub7c9\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c PAR\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774\uc0b0 \ubcc0\uc218 \ub610\ub294 \uc591\uc790\ud654\ub41c \ubcc0\uc218\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\ud569\uc801\uc778 \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uacf5\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ub3c4\uc804\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc870\uac01\ubcc4 \uc544\ud540 \uc815\uaddc\ud654(PAR)\ub294 \uc5f0\uc18d \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uc591\uc790\ud654\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc720\uc5f0\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \ubc0f \uacc4\uc0b0 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uac10\ub3c5 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0 \uc911\uc810\uc744 \ub450\uace0 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubc0f \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c PAR\uc758 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uae30\ucd08\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uba3c\uc800, \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130 \uc218\uac00 \uc0d8\ud50c \uc218\ub97c \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\ub294 \uacfc\ub2e4 \ud30c\ub77c\ubbf8\ud130\ud654\ub41c \uc601\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c PAR \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \uc190\uc2e4 \ud568\uc218\uc758 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc911\ub300\ud55c \uc810\uc740 \ub192\uc740 \uc815\ub3c4\uc758 \uc591\uc790\ud654\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub458\uc9f8, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c (\ubcfc\ub85d, \uc900\ubcfc\ub85d \ubc0f \ube44\ubcfc\ub85d) PAR\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub2eb\ud78c \ud615\ud0dc\uc758 \uadfc\uc811 \ub9e4\ud551\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\uace0, \uadfc\uc811 \uacbd\ub7c9 \ubc29\ubc95, \uadf8 \uac00\uc18d\ub41c \ubcc0\ud615 \ubc0f \uad50\ucc28 \ubc29\ud5a5 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec PAR \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc14b\uc9f8, PAR \uc815\uaddc\ud654 \uc120\ud615 \ud68c\uadc0 \ubb38\uc81c\uc758 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 PAR\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uace0\uc804\uc801\uc778 $\u0014_1$-, \uc81c\uacf1 $\u0014_2$-, \ube44\ubcfc\ub85d \uc815\uaddc\ud654\uc758 \uadfc\uc0ac\uce58\ub97c \uc5bb\uace0, \uc591\uc790\ud654\ub41c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \ubcf4\uc7a5\uc744 \uc5bb\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

In such settings, practitioners often desire predictions that not only\nexhibit good overall accuracy, but also remain reliable within each source and\npreserve the differences that matter across sources. For instance, several\nasylum and refugee resettlement programs now use ML-based employment\npredictions to guide where newly arriving families are placed within a host\ncountry, which requires generating informative and differentiated predictions\nfor many and often small source locations. However, this task is made\nchallenging by several common characteristics of the data in these settings:\nthe presence of numerous distinct data sources, distributional shifts between\nthem, and substantial variation in sample sizes across sources. This paper\nintroduces Clustered Transfer Residual Learning (CTRL), a meta-learning method\nthat combines the strengths of cross-domain residual learning and adaptive\npooling/clustering in order to simultaneously improve overall accuracy and\npreserve source-level heterogeneity. We provide theoretical results that\nclarify how our objective navigates the trade-off between data quantity and\ndata quality.

However, due to the parameter explosion and data\nsparsity issues, Bayesian network classifiers are restricted to low-order\nfeature dependency modeling, making them struggle in extrapolating the\noccurrence probabilities of complex real-world data. In this paper, we propose\na novel paradigm to design high-order Bayesian network classifiers, by learning\ndistributional representations for feature values, as what has been done in\nword embedding and graph representation learning. The learned distributional\nrepresentations are encoded with the semantic relatedness between different\nfeatures through their observed co-occurrence patterns in training data, which\nthen serve as a hallmark to extrapolate the occurrence probabilities of new\ntest samples. As a classifier design realization, we remake the K-dependence\nBayesian classifier (KDB) by extending it into a neural version, i.e.,\nNeuralKDB, where a novel neural network architecture is designed to learn\ndistributional representations of feature values and parameterize the\nconditional probabilities between interdependent features. A stochastic\ngradient descent based algorithm is designed to train the NeuralKDB model\nefficiently. Extensive classification experiments on 60 UCI datasets\ndemonstrate that the proposed NeuralKDB classifier excels in capturing\nhigh-order feature dependencies and significantly outperforms the conventional\nBayesian network classifiers, as well as other competitive classifiers,\nincluding two neural network based classifiers without distributional\nrepresentation learning.", "AI": {"tldr":

With\nadvances in edge intelligence, IoT devices have evolved from simple data\nacquisition units into computationally capable nodes, enabling localized\nprocessing of heterogeneous multimodal data. This evolution necessitates\ndistributed learning paradigms that can efficiently handle such data.\nFurthermore, the continuous nature of data generation and the limited storage\ncapacity of edge devices demand an online learning framework. Multimodal Online\nFederated Learning (MMO-FL) has emerged as a promising approach to meet these\nrequirements. However, MMO-FL faces new challenges due to the inherent\ninstability of IoT devices, which often results in modality quantity and\nquality imbalance (QQI) during data collection. In this work, we systematically\ninvestigate the impact of QQI within the MMO-FL framework and present a\ncomprehensive theoretical analysis quantifying how both types of imbalance\ndegrade learning performance. To address these challenges, we propose the\nModality Quantity and Quality Rebalanced (QQR) algorithm, a prototype learning\nbased method designed to operate in parallel with the training process.\nExtensive experiments on two real-world multimodal datasets show that the\nproposed QQR algorithm consistently outperforms benchmarks under modality\nimbalance conditions with promising

Prior probabilistic approaches addressed the missing view problem by\nusing a product-of-experts scheme to aggregate representations from present\nviews and achieved superior performance over deterministic classifiers, using\nthe information bottleneck (IB) principle. However, the IB framework is\ninherently fully supervised and cannot leverage unlabeled data. In this work,\nwe propose a semi-supervised generative model that utilizes both labeled and\nunlabeled samples in a unified framework. Our method maximizes the likelihood\nof unlabeled samples to learn a latent space shared with the IB on labeled\ndata. We also perform cross-view mutual information maximization in the latent\nspace to enhance the extraction of shared information across views.

This simplistic assumption prevents models from\naccurately capturing the complex, non-Gaussian landscapes of natural data,\nparticularly in demanding domains like complex biological data, severely\nhindering the fidelity of the model for scientific discovery. The\nphysically-grounded Boltzmann distribution offers a more expressive\nalternative, but it is computationally intractable on classical computers. To\ndate, quantum approaches have been hampered by the insufficient qubit scale and\noperational stability required for the iterative demands of deep learning.\nHere, we bridge this gap by introducing the Quantum Boltzmann\nMachine-Variational Autoencoder (QBM-VAE), a large-scale and long-time stable\nhybrid quantum-classical architecture. Our framework leverages a quantum\nprocessor for efficient sampling from the Boltzmann distribution, enabling its\nuse as a powerful prior within a deep generative model. Applied to\nmillion-scale single-cell datasets from multiple sources, the QBM-VAE generates\na latent space that better preserves complex biological structures,\nconsistently outperforming conventional Gaussian-based deep learning models\nlike VAE and SCVI in essential tasks such as omics data integration, cell-type\nclassification, and trajectory inference. It also provides a typical example of\nintroducing a physics priori into deep learning to drive the model to acquire\nscientific discovery capabilities that breaks through data limitations. This\nwork provides the demonstration of a practical quantum advantage in deep\nlearning on a large-scale scientific problem and offers a transferable\nblueprint for developing hybrid quantum AI

For example, clinicians may evaluate risks prenatally, at\nbirth, and during Well-Child visits. Although predictions made at later stages\ntypically achieve higher precision, it is clinically desirable to make reliable\nrisk assessments as early as possible. Therefore, this study focuses on\nimproving prediction performance in early-stage risk assessments. Our solution,\n\\textbf{Borrowing From the Future (BFF)}, is a contrastive multi-modal\nframework that treats each time window as a distinct modality. In BFF, a model\nis trained on all available data throughout the time while performing a risk\nassessment using up-to-date information. This contrastive framework allows the\nmodel to ``borrow'' informative signals from later stages (e.g., Well-Child\nvisits) to implicitly supervise the learning at earlier stages (e.g.,\nprenatal/birth stages).

To address this, we propose an air quality PM2.5 index prediction\nmodel based on a hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture. The model effectively combines\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for local spatial feature extraction and\nLong Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for modeling temporal dependencies in\ntime series data. Using a multivariate dataset collected from an industrial\narea in Beijing between 2010 and 2015 -- which includes hourly records of PM2.5\nconcentration, temperature, dew point, pressure, wind direction, wind speed,\nand precipitation -- the model predicts the average PM2.5 concentration over\n6-hour intervals. Experimental results show that the model achieves a root mean\nsquare error (RMSE) of 5.236, outperforming traditional time series models in\nboth accuracy and generalization. This demonstrates its strong potential in\nreal-world applications such as air pollution early warning systems. However,\ndue to the complexity of multivariate inputs, the model demands high\ncomputational resources, and its ability to handle diverse atmospheric factors\nstill requires optimization. Future work will focus on enhancing scalability\nand expanding support for more complex multivariate weather prediction tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 CNN-LSTM \uad6c\uc870\ub97c

However, existing methods suffer from\nthree critical limitations: (1) they rely on homogeneous diffusion with static\ndynamics, limiting adaptability to diverse graph structures; (2) their depth is\nconstrained by computational overhead and diminishing interpretability; and (3)\ntheoretical understanding of their convergence behavior remains limited. To\naddress these challenges, we propose GODNF, a Generalized Opinion Dynamics\nNeural Framework, which unifies multiple opinion dynamics models into a\nprincipled, trainable diffusion mechanism. Our framework captures heterogeneous\ndiffusion patterns and temporal dynamics via node-specific behavior modeling\nand dynamic neighborhood influence, while ensuring efficient and interpretable\nmessage propagation even at deep layers. We provide a rigorous theoretical\nanalysis demonstrating GODNF's ability to model diverse convergence\nconfigurations. Extensive empirical evaluations of node classification and\ninfluence estimation tasks confirm GODNF's superiority over state-of-the-art\nGNNs.", "AI": {"tldr": "GODNF\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uad6c\uc870\uc5d0 \uc801\ud569\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ub2e4\ub8ec\ub2e4.", "motivation": "GNNs\uc758 \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0 \uc804\ub2ec \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uacfc \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \ud655\uc0b0 \uacfc\uc815 \uac04\uc758 \uc5f0\uacb0\uc131\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uc5ec \ud655\uc0b0 \uae30\ubc18 GNN \uac1c\ubc1c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad00\uc2ec\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "GODNF\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc758\uacac \uc5ed\ub3d9\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc6d0\uce59\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud6c8\ub828 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud655\uc0b0 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "GODNF\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc218\ub834 \uad6c\uc131\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \ud0c1\uc6d4\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "GODNF\ub294 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 GNNs\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud655\uc0b0 \uae30\ubc18 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(GNN) \uac1c\ubc1c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad00\uc2ec\uc774 \uae09\uc99d\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, GNN\uc758 \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0 \uc804\ub2ec \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uacfc \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \ud655\uc0b0 \uacfc\uc815 \uac04\uc758 \uc5f0\uacb0\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uba87 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc81c\ud55c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4: (1) \ub3d9\uc801 \ud2b9\uc131\uc774 \uc815\uc801\uc778 \ub3d9\uc9c8\uc801 \ud655\uc0b0\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uad6c\uc870\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub835\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4; (2) \uae4a\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\uc640 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \uac10\uc18c\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4; (3) \uc218\ub834 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uc774\ud574\uac00 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub3c4\uc804\uc5d0 \ub300\uc751\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc758\uacac \uc5ed\ub3d9\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc6d0\uce59\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud6c8\ub828 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud655\uc0b0 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub41c \uc758\uacac \uc5ed\ub3d9\uc131 \uc2e0\uacbd \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c(GODNF)\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ub178\ub4dc \ud2b9\uc815 \ud589\ub3d9 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \ubc0f \ub3d9\uc801 \uc774\uc6c3 \uc601\ud5a5\ub825\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ud655\uc0b0 \ud328\ud134\uacfc \uc2dc\uac04 \uc5ed\ub3d9\uc131\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uba70, \uae4a\uc740 \uce35\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0 \uc804\ud30c\ub97c \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 GODNF\uac00 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc218\ub834 \uad6c\uc131\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\ub294 \ucca0\uc800\ud55c \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub178\ub4dc \ubd84\ub958 \ubc0f \uc601\ud5a5 \ucd94\uc815 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c \uacbd\ud5d8\uc801 \ud3c9\uac00 \uacb0\uacfc, GODNF\ub294 \ucd5c\ucca8\ub2e8 GNN\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

The main aim is to reconstruct GPS trajectories with high\naccuracy, independent of input data quality. Building upon the original\nalgorithm, developed exclusively for aligning GPS signals to road networks, we\nextend its capabilities by integrating trajectory imputation.

Model reuse has been widely applied to reduce training\ncosts, but indiscriminately reusing entire models may incur significant\ninference overhead. Consequently, DNN modularization has gained attention,\nenabling module reuse by decomposing DNN models. The emerging\nmodularizing-while-training (MwT) paradigm, which incorporates modularization\ninto training, outperforms modularizing-after-training approaches. However,\nexisting MwT methods focus on small-scale CNN models at the convolutional\nkernel level and struggle with diverse DNNs and large-scale models,\nparticularly Transformer-based models. To address these limitations, we propose\nNeMo, a scalable and generalizable MwT approach. NeMo operates at the neuron\nlevel fundamental component common to all DNNs-ensuring applicability to\nTransformers and various architectures. We design a contrastive learning-based\nmodular training method with an effective composite loss function, enabling\nscalability to large-scale models. Comprehensive experiments on two\nTransformer-based models and four CNN models across two classification datasets\ndemonstrate NeMo's superiority over state-of-the-art MwT methods. Results show\naverage gains of 1.72% in module classification accuracy and 58.10% reduction\nin module size, demonstrating efficacy across both CNN and large-scale\nTransformer-based models.

This convenience, combined with continued advances in LLM\ncapability, has the potential to drive their adoption across a broad range of\ndomains, including high-stakes applications where group fairness -- preventing\ndisparate impacts across demographic groups -- is essential. The majority of\nexisting approaches to enforcing group fairness on LLM-based classifiers rely\non traditional fair algorithms applied via model fine-tuning or head-tuning on\nfinal-layer embeddings, but they are no longer applicable to closed-weight LLMs\nunder the in-context learning setting, which include some of the most capable\ncommercial models today, such as GPT-4, Gemini, and Claude. In this paper, we\npropose a framework for deriving fair classifiers from closed-weight LLMs via\nprompting: the LLM is treated as a feature extractor, and features are elicited\nfrom its probabilistic predictions (e.g., token log probabilities) using\nprompts strategically designed for the specified fairness criterion to obtain\nsufficient statistics for fair classification; a fair algorithm is then applied\nto these features to train a lightweight fair classifier in a post-hoc manner.\nExperiments on five datasets, including three tabular ones, demonstrate strong\naccuracy-fairness tradeoffs for the classifiers derived by our framework from\nboth open-weight and closed-weight LLMs; in particular, our framework is\ndata-efficient and outperforms fair classifiers trained on LLM embeddings\n(i.e., head-tuning) or from scratch on raw tabular features.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud3d0\uc1c4\ud615 \uac00\uc911\uce58 LLM\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uacf5\uc815 \ubd84\ub958\uae30\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub192\uc740 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc640 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM\uc758 \uac04\ud3b8\ud55c \uc0ac\uc6a9\uacfc \uacc4\uc18d\ub418\ub294 \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \uc778\uad6c \ud1b5\uacc4 \uadf8\ub8f9 \uac04\uc758 \ubd88\uade0\ud615\ud55c \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubc29\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uc9d1\ub2e8 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \uace0\uc704\ud5d8 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 LLM\uc758 \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "LLM\uc744 \ud2b9\uc9d5 \ucd94\ucd9c\uae30\ub85c \ucde8\uae09\ud558\uace0, \uacf5\uc815\uc131 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud655\ub960 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0\uc11c \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ud6c4 \uc774 \ud2b9\uc131\uc5d0 \uacf5\uc815 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac00\ubcbc\uc6b4 \uacf5\uc815 \ubd84\ub958\uae30\ub97c \ud6c4\ucc98\ub9ac \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \ud6c8\ub828\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub2e4\uc12f \uac1c\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc740 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ub41c \ubd84\ub958\uae30\uac00 \ub192\uc740 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uc640 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uba70 LLM \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud6c8\ub828\ub41c \uacf5\uc815 \ubd84\ub958\uae30\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc6b0\uc218\ud558\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc9c0\uce68\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc138\ubc00\ud558\uac8c \uc870\uc815\ub41c \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \uc81c\ub85c\uc0f7 \ub610\ub294 \uba87\uc0f7 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784(\ubb38\ub9e5 \ub0b4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc774\ub77c\uace0\ub3c4 \ud568)\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \uc608\uce21 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc6a9\uc774\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud3b8\ub9ac\ud568\uc740 LLM \uae30\ub2a5\uc758 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ubc1c\uc804\uacfc \uacb0\ud569\ub418\uc5b4 \uadf8\ub8f9 \uacf5\uc815\uc131-\uc778\uad6c \ud1b5\uacc4 \uadf8\ub8f9 \uac04\uc758 \ubd88\uade0\ud615\ud55c \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubc29\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uac83-\uc774 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc778 \uace0\uc704\ud5d8 \uc751\uc6a9 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 LLM\uc758 \ucc44\ud0dd\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \ubd84\ub958\uae30\uc5d0\uc11c \uadf8\ub8f9 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc740 \ucd5c\uc885 \uce35 \uc784\ubca0\ub529\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378 \ubbf8\uc138 \uc870\uc815\uc774\ub098 \ud5e4\ub4dc \uc870\uc815\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uacf5\uc815 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub294 \uc624\ub298\ub0a0 GPT-4, \uc81c\ubbf8\ub2c8, \ud074\ub85c\ub4dc\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uac00\uc7a5 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc0c1\uc5c5\uc801 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uc5ec \ubb38\ub9e5 \ub0b4 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ud3d0\uc1c4\ud615 \uac00\uc911\uce58 LLM\uc5d0\ub294 \ub354 \uc774\uc0c1 \uc801\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud3d0\uc1c4\ud615 \uac00\uc911\uce58 LLM\uc5d0\uc11c \uacf5\uc815 \ubd84\ub958\uae30\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: LLM\uc740 \ud2b9\uc9d5 \ucd94\ucd9c\uae30\ub85c \ucc98\ub9ac\ub418\uace0, \uacf5\uc815\ud55c \ubd84\ub958\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ucda9\ubd84\ud55c \ud1b5\uacc4\ub97c \uc5bb\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc9c0\uc815\ub41c \uacf5\uc815\uc131 \uae30\uc900\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc124\uacc4\ub41c \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud655\ub960 \uc608\uce21(\uc608: \ud1a0\ud070 \ub85c\uadf8 \ud655\ub960)\uc5d0\uc11c \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc774 \uc720\ub3c4\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4;

To address these limitations,\ntest-time reinforcement learning (TTRL) has been proposed, which enables\nself-optimization by leveraging model-generated pseudo-labels. Despite its\npromise, TTRL faces several key challenges, including high inference costs due\nto parallel rollouts and early-stage estimation bias that fosters\noverconfidence, reducing output diversity and causing performance plateaus. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce an entropy-based mechanism to enhance\nthe exploration-exploitation balance in test-time reinforcement learning\nthrough two strategies: Entropy-fork Tree Majority Rollout (ETMR) and\nEntropy-based Advantage Reshaping (EAR). Compared with the baseline, our\napproach enables Llama3.1-8B to achieve a 68 percent relative improvement in\nPass at 1 metric on the AIME 2024 benchmark, while consuming only 60 percent of\nthe rollout tokens budget.

This formulation uncovers two critical but underexplored\nchallenges-the fragility of individual temporal sub-networks and the tendency\nfor adversarial vulnerabilities to transfer across time. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose Robust Temporal self-Ensemble (RTE), a training\nframework that improves the robustness of each sub-network while reducing the\ntemporal transferability of adversarial perturbations. RTE integrates both\nobjectives into a unified loss and employs a stochastic sampling strategy for\nefficient optimization. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks\ndemonstrate that RTE consistently outperforms existing training methods in\nrobust-accuracy trade-off.

This paper proposed PTSM (Physiology-aware and Task-invariant\nSpatio-temporal Modeling), a novel framework for interpretable and robust EEG\ndecoding across unseen subjects. PTSM employs a dual-branch masking mechanism\nthat independently learns personalized and shared spatio-temporal patterns,\nenabling the model to preserve individual-specific neural characteristics while\nextracting task-relevant, population-shared features. The masks are factorized\nacross temporal and spatial dimensions, allowing fine-grained modulation of\ndynamic EEG patterns with low computational overhead. To further address\nrepresentational entanglement, PTSM enforces information-theoretic constraints\nthat decompose latent embeddings into orthogonal task-related and\nsubject-related subspaces.

However, existing methods rely on homophily-based low-frequency\nknowledge, failing to handle diverse spectral distributions in real-world\ngraphs with varying homophily. Our theoretical analysis reveals a spectral\nspecificity principle: optimal knowledge transfer requires alignment between\npre-trained spectral filters and the intrinsic spectrum of downstream graphs.\nUnder limited supervision, large spectral gaps between pre-training and\ndownstream tasks impede effective adaptation. To bridge this gap, we propose\nthe HS-GPPT model, a novel framework that ensures spectral alignment throughout\nboth pre-training and prompt-tuning. We utilize a hybrid spectral filter\nbackbone and local-global contrastive learning to acquire abundant spectral\nknowledge. Then we design prompt graphs to align the spectral distribution with\npretexts, facilitating spectral knowledge transfer across homophily and\nheterophily.

Gradient-based DFL requires computing\nthe derivative of the solution to the optimization problem with respect to the\npredicted parameters. However, for many optimization problems, such as linear\nprograms (LPs), the gradient of the regret with respect to the predicted\nparameters is zero almost everywhere. Existing gradient-based DFL approaches\nfor LPs try to circumvent this issue in one of two ways: (a) smoothing the LP\ninto a differentiable optimization problem by adding a quadratic regularizer\nand then minimizing the regret directly or (b) minimizing surrogate losses that\nhave informative (sub)gradients. In this paper, we show that the former\napproach still results in zero gradients, because even after smoothing the\nregret remains constant across large regions of the parameter space. To address\nthis, we propose minimizing surrogate losses -- even when a differentiable\noptimization layer is used and regret can be minimized directly. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that minimizing surrogate losses allows differentiable\noptimization layers to achieve regret comparable to or better than\nsurrogate-loss based DFL methods. Further, we demonstrate that this also holds\nfor DYS-Net, a recently proposed differentiable optimization technique for LPs,\nthat computes approximate solutions and gradients through operations that can\nbe performed using feedforward neural network layers. Because DYS-Net executes\nthe forward and the backward pass very efficiently, by minimizing surrogate\nlosses using DYS-Net, we are able to attain regret on par with the\nstate-of-the-art while reducing training time by a significant margin.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub300\uccb4 \uc190\uc2e4\uc744 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec, \uacb0\uc815 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uba38\uc2e0 \ub7ec\ub2dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\ub294 \uacb0\uc815 \uc911\uc2ec \ud559\uc2b5(DFL)\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud568.", "motivation": "\uacb0\uc815 \uc911\uc2ec \ud559\uc2b5(DFL)\uc740 \uba38\uc2e0 \ub7ec\ub2dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\uc758 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\uc5ec \uacb0\uc815 \ud6c4\ud68c(regret)\ub97c \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uacb0\uc815 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774\uc804 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc774 \uc9c1\uad00\uc801\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \ub300\uccb4 \uc190\uc2e4\uc744 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uc5c8\ub2e4\uace0 \ubcf4\uace0, \uc774 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub2e4\ubd84\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 DYS-Net\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \ucd5c\uadfc \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ub2e4\ubd84\ud654 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uae30\uc220\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc190\uc2e4\uc744 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "Experiments show that our approach enables achieving performance of regret comparable to or better than existing gradient-based DFL methods.", "conclusion": "\ub300\uccb4 \uc190\uc2e4\uc744 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ucd5c\uc2e0 \uae30\uc220\uacfc \ub3d9\ub4f1\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ud6c8\ub828 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc904\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uacb0\uc815 \uc911\uc2ec \ud559\uc2b5(DFL)\uc740 \uba38\uc2e0 \ub7ec\ub2dd(ML) \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\uc758 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\uc5ec \uacb0\uc815 \ud6c4\ud68c(decision regret)\ub97c \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\uace0, \uc989 \uacb0\uc815 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 DFL\uc740 \uc608\uce21\ub41c \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\uc758 \ud574\uc758 \ub3c4\ud568\uc218\ub97c \uacc4\uc0b0\ud574\uc57c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc120\ud615 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d(LP)\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ub9ce\uc740 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c, \uc608\uce21\ub41c \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud6c4\ud68c\uc758 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8\ub294 \uac70\uc758 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uacf3\uc5d0\uc11c 0\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uae30\ubc18 DFL \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubc29\ubc95 \uc911 \ud558\ub098\ub85c \uc6b0\ud68c\ud558\ub824\uace0 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4: (a) 2\ucc28 \uc815\uaddc\ud654\ub97c \ucd94\uac00\ud558\uc5ec LP\ub97c \ubbf8\ubd84 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \ubd80\ub4dc\ub7fd\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4e0 \ud6c4 \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud6c4\ud68c\ub97c \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\uac70\ub098, (b) \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c (\ubd80\ubd84) \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \ub300\uccb4 \uc190\uc2e4\uc744 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc804\uc790\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 0 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc65c\ub0d0\ud558\uba74 \ubd80\ub4dc\ub7fd\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4e0 \ud6c4\ud68c\ub294 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218 \uacf5\uac04\uc758 \ub113\uc740 \uc601\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\uc815\ud558\uac8c \uc720\uc9c0\ub418\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub300\uccb4 \uc190\uc2e4\uc744 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4 -

Existing approaches that\nintegrate SFT and RL often face the risk of disrupting established model\npatterns and inducing overfitting to expert data. To address this, we present a\nnovel investigation into the unified view of SFT and RL through an off-policy\nversus on-policy lens. We propose CHORD, a framework for the Controllable\nHarmonization of On- and Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning via Dynamic\nWeighting, which reframes SFT not as a separate stage but as a dynamically\nweighted auxiliary objective within the on-policy RL process. Based on an\nanalysis of off-policy expert data's influence at both holistic and granular\nlevels, we incorporate a dual-control mechanism in CHORD. Specifically, the\nframework first employs a global coefficient to holistically guide the\ntransition from off-policy imitation to on-policy exploration, and then applies\na token-wise weighting function that enables granular learning from expert\ntokens, which preserves on-policy exploration and mitigates disruption from\noff-policy data. We conduct extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks,\nproviding empirical evidence that CHORD achieves a stable and efficient\nlearning process.

Although existing CP methods\nare guaranteed to achieve marginal coverage, they often exhibit imbalanced\ncoverage across classes under long-tail label distributions, tending to over\ncover the head classes at the expense of under covering the remaining tail\nclasses. This under coverage is particularly concerning, as it undermines the\nreliability of the prediction sets for minority classes, even with coverage\nensured on average. In this paper, we propose the Tail-Aware Conformal\nPrediction (TACP) method to mitigate the under coverage of the tail classes by\nutilizing the long-tail structure and narrowing the head-tail coverage gap.\nTheoretical analysis shows that it consistently achieves a smaller head-tail\ncoverage gap than standard methods. To further improve coverage balance across\nall classes, we introduce an extension of TACP: soft TACP (sTACP) via a\nreweighting mechanism.

However, theoretical guarantees about such algorithms only exist for\nsimple decision functions, and it is unclear whether and under which\nassumptions similar results might exist for complex models. In this paper, we\nintroduce a general, learning-theory-based framework for what it means for an\nexplanation to provide information about a decision function. We call an\nexplanation informative if it serves to reduce the complexity of the space of\nplausible decision functions. With this approach, we show that many popular\nexplanation algorithms are not informative when applied to complex decision\nfunctions, providing a rigorous mathematical rejection of the idea that it\nshould be possible to explain any model. We then derive conditions under which\ndifferent explanation algorithms become informative. These are often stronger\nthan what one might expect. For example, gradient explanations and\ncounterfactual explanations are non-informative with respect to the space of\ndifferentiable functions, and SHAP and anchor explanations are not informative\nwith respect to the space of decision trees. Based on these results, we discuss\nhow explanation algorithms can be modified to become informative. While the\nproposed analysis of explanation algorithms is mathematical, we argue that it\nholds strong implications for the practical applicability of these algorithms,\nparticularly for auditing, regulation, and high-risk applications of AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uba38\uc2e0\ub7ec\ub2dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30\uc744

In response to increasing scrutiny of\nvoluntary carbon markets, this study presents a dataset on global afforestation\nand reforestation efforts compiled from primary (meta-)information and\naugmented with time-series satellite imagery and other secondary data. Our\ndataset covers 1,289,068 planting sites from 45,628 projects spanning 33 years.\nSince any remote sensing-based validation effort relies on the integrity of a\nplanting site's geographic boundary, this dataset introduces a standardized\nassessment of the provided site-level location information, which we summarize\nin one easy-to-communicate key indicator: LDIS -- the Location Data Integrity\nScore. We find that approximately 79\\% of the georeferenced planting sites\nmonitored fail on at least 1 out of 10 LDIS indicators, while 15\\% of the\nmonitored projects lack machine-readable georeferenced data in the first place.\nIn addition to enhancing accountability in the voluntary carbon market, the\npresented dataset also holds value as training data for e.g. computer\nvision-related tasks with

Recent work has introduced\nself-explainable GNNs that generate explanations as part of training, improving\nboth faithfulness and efficiency. Some of these models, such as ProtGNN and\nPGIB, learn class-specific prototypes, offering a potential pathway toward\nclass-level explanations. However, their evaluations focus solely on\ninstance-level explanations, leaving open the question of whether these\nprototypes meaningfully generalize across instances of the same class. In this\npaper, we introduce GraphOracle, a novel self-explainable GNN framework\ndesigned to generate and evaluate class-level explanations for GNNs. Our model\njointly learns a GNN classifier and a set of structured, sparse subgraphs that\nare discriminative for each class. We propose a novel integrated training that\ncaptures graph$\\unicode{x2013}$subgraph$\\unicode{x2013}$prediction dependencies\nefficiently and faithfully, validated through a masking-based evaluation\nstrategy. This strategy enables us to retroactively assess whether prior\nmethods like ProtGNN and PGIB deliver effective class-level explanations. Our\nresults show that they do not. In contrast, GraphOracle achieves superior\nfidelity, explainability, and scalability across a range of graph\nclassification tasks. We further demonstrate that GraphOracle avoids the\ncomputational bottlenecks of previous methods$\\unicode{x2014}$like Monte Carlo\nTree Search$\\unicode{x2014}$by using entropy-regularized subgraph selection and\nlightweight random walk extraction, enabling faster and more scalable training.\nThese findings position GraphOracle as a practical and principled solution for\nfaithful class-level self-explainability in GNNs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(GNN)\uc758 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc548\uc804\ud558\uace0 \uacf5\uc815\ud55c \ubc30\uce58\ub97c \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.

While\nexisting approaches have explored several strategies, such as resampling and\nreweighting, for imbalanced data stream learning, our work distinguishes itself\nby addressing the imbalance problem through training modification, particularly\nfocusing on gradient descent techniques. We introduce the harmonized gradient\ndescent (HGD) algorithm, which aims to equalize the norms of gradients across\ndifferent classes. By ensuring the gradient norm balance, HGD mitigates\nunder-fitting for minor classes and achieves balanced online learning. Notably,\nHGD operates in a streamlined implementation process, requiring no data-buffer,\nextra parameters, or prior knowledge, making it applicable to any learning\nmodels utilizing gradient descent for optimization. Theoretical analysis, based\non a few common and mild assumptions, shows that HGD achieves a satisfied\nsub-linear regret bound. The proposed algorithm are compared with the commonly\nused online imbalance learning methods under several imbalanced data stream\nscenarios.

Currently under review at \"Artificial Intelligence Review\"\n  journal", "summary": "Artificial intelligence is reshaping science and industry, yet many users\nstill regard its models as opaque \"black boxes\". Conventional explainable\nartificial-intelligence methods clarify individual predictions but overlook the\nupstream decisions and downstream quality checks that determine whether\ninsights can be trusted. In this work, we present Holistic Explainable\nArtificial Intelligence (HXAI), a user-centric framework that embeds\nexplanation into every stage of the data-analysis workflow and tailors those\nexplanations to users. HXAI unifies six components (data, analysis set-up,\nlearning process, model output, model quality, communication channel) into a\nsingle taxonomy and aligns each component with the needs of domain experts,\ndata analysts and data scientists. A 112-item question bank covers these needs;\nour survey of contemporary tools highlights critical coverage gaps. Grounded in\ntheories of human explanation, principles from human-computer interaction and\nfindings from empirical user studies, HXAI identifies the characteristics that\nmake explanations clear, actionable and cognitively manageable. A comprehensive\ntaxonomy operationalises these insights, reducing terminological ambiguity and\nenabling rigorous coverage analysis of existing toolchains.

However, many real-world systems, such as social or\nbiological networks, exhibit complex interactions that are more naturally\nrepresented by higher-order topological domains. The emerging field of\nGeometric and Topological Deep Learning addresses this challenge by introducing\nmethods that utilize and benefit from higher-order structures. Central to TDL\nis the concept of lifting, which transforms data representations from basic\ngraph forms to more expressive topologies before the application of GNN models\nfor learning. In this work, we propose a structural lifting strategy using\nForman-Ricci curvature, which defines an edge-based network characteristic\nbased on Riemannian geometry. Curvature reveals local and global properties of\na graph, such as a network's backbones, i.e. coarse, structure-preserving graph\ngeometries that form connections between major communities - most suitably\nrepresented as hyperedges to model information flows between clusters across\nlarge distances in the network. To this end, our approach provides a remedy to\nthe problem of information distortion in message passing across long distances\nand graph bottlenecks - a phenomenon known in graph learning as over-squashing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 Forman-Ricci \uacf1\ub960\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ub9ac\ud504\ud305 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(GNN) \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uae30 \uc804\uc5d0 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ub354 \ud45c\ud604\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uc704\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc740 \uad00\uacc4\ud615 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ub9ce\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \ucc28\uc6d0 \uc704\uc0c1 \uad6c\uc870\ub85c \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7fd\uac8c \ud45c\ud604\ub418\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b8\ub2e4.", "method": "Forman-Ricci \uacf1\ub960\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\uc801 \ub9ac\ud504\ud305 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\ubcf8 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ud615\ud0dc\uc5d0\uc11c \ub354 \ud45c\ud604\ub825\uc774 \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \uc704\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \ubcc0\ud658\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ubcf4 \uc65c\uace1 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0 \uc5f0\uacb0 \uace0\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc774\uc758 \uc815\ubcf4 \ud750\ub984\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud558\uc774\ud37c\uc5e3\uc9c0\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \ucee4\ubba4\ub2c8\ud2f0 \uac04\uc758 \uc5f0\uacb0\uc744 \ud615\uc131\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \uace8\uaca9\uc744 \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc7a5\uac70\ub9ac \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0 \uc804\ub2ec \ubc0f \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \ubcd1\ubaa9 \ud604\uc0c1\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc65c\uace1 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc644\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc744 \uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc740 \uad00\uacc4\ud615 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\uba70, \ub178\ub4dc \ubc0f \uc5e3\uc9c0 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uad6c\uc870\uc758 \uace0\uc720\ud55c \ub300\uce6d\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \ub610\ub294 \uc0dd\ubb3c\ud559\uc801 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub192\uc740 \ucc28\uc218\uc758 \uc704\uc0c1\uc801 \uc601\uc5ed\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7fd\uac8c \ud45c\ud604\ub418\ub294 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\ud558\ud559\uc801 \ubc0f \uc704\uc0c1\uc801 \uc2ec\uce35 \ud559\uc2b5\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubd84\uc57c\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub354 \ub192\uc740 \ucc28\uc218\uc758 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uace0 \uc774\uc810\uc744 \uc5bb\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

To address this, we propose LatEnt blAck-box Design (LEAD), a\nsequence-structure co-design framework that optimizes both sequence and\nstructure within their shared latent space. Optimizing shared latent codes can\nnot only break through the limitations of existing methods, but also ensure\nsynchronization of different modality designs. Particularly, we design a\nblack-box guidance strategy to accommodate real-world scenarios where many\nproperty evaluators are non-differentiable. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat our LEAD achieves superior optimization performance for both single and\nmulti-property objectives.

However, existing methods for CBT learning\nsuch as conventional machine learning and graph neural networks (GNNs) are\nhindered by several limitations. These include: (i) poor interpretability due\nto their black-box nature, (ii) high computational cost, and (iii) an exclusive\nfocus on structure and topology, overlooking the cognitive capacity of the\ngenerated CBT. To address these challenges, we introduce mCOCO (multi-sensory\nCOgnitive COmputing), a novel framework that leverages Reservoir Computing (RC)\nto learn population-level functional CBT from BOLD\n(Blood-Oxygen-level-Dependent) signals. RC's dynamic system properties allow\nfor tracking state changes over time, enhancing interpretability and enabling\nthe modeling of brain-like dynamics, as demonstrated in prior literature. By\nintegrating multi-sensory inputs (e.g., text, audio, and visual data), mCOCO\ncaptures not only structure and topology but also how brain regions process\ninformation and adapt to cognitive tasks such as sensory processing, all in a\ncomputationally efficient manner. Our mCOCO framework consists of two phases:\n(1) mapping BOLD signals into the reservoir to derive individual functional\nconnectomes, which are then aggregated into a group-level CBT - an approach, to\nthe best of our knowledge, not previously explored in functional connectivity\nstudies - and (2) incorporating multi-sensory inputs through a cognitive\nreservoir, endowing the CBT with cognitive traits. Extensive evaluations show\nthat our mCOCO-based template significantly outperforms GNN-based CBT in terms\nof centeredness, discriminativeness, topological soundness, and multi-sensory\nmemory retention.

Evaluating uncertainty estimates in binary classification models", "comment": null, "summary": "Rigorous statistical methods, including parameter estimation with\naccompanying uncertainties, underpin the validity of scientific discovery,\nespecially in the natural sciences. With increasingly complex data models such\nas deep learning techniques, uncertainty quantification has become exceedingly\ndifficult and a plethora of techniques have been proposed. In this case study,\nwe use the unifying framework of approximate Bayesian inference combined with\nempirical tests on carefully created synthetic classification datasets to\ninvestigate qualitative properties of six different probabilistic machine\nlearning algorithms for class probability and uncertainty estimation: (i) a\nneural network ensemble, (ii) neural network ensemble with conflictual loss,\n(iii) evidential deep learning, (iv) a single neural network with Monte Carlo\nDropout, (v) Gaussian process classification and (vi) a Dirichlet process\nmixture model.

The primary contribution\nis a transparent and reproducible methodology that combines Automated Machine\nLearning (AutoML) and explainable artificial intelligence (AI) to identify and\ninterpret key risk factors associated with severe crashes. Using the JADBio\nAutoML platform, predictive models were constructed to distinguish between\nsevere and non-severe crash outcomes. The models underwent rigorous feature\nselection across stratified training subsets, and their outputs were\ninterpreted using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to quantify the\ncontribution of individual features. A final Ridge Logistic Regression model\nachieved an AUC-ROC of 85.6% on the training set and 84.9% on a hold-out test\nset, with 17 features consistently identified as the most influential\npredictors. Key features spanned demographic, environmental, vehicle, human,\nand operational categories, including location type, posted speed, minimum\noccupant age, and pre-crash action. Notably, certain traditionally emphasized\nfactors, such as alcohol or drug impairment, were less influential in the final\nmodel compared to environmental and contextual variables. Emphasizing\nmethodological rigor and interpretability over mere predictive performance,\nthis study offers a scalable framework to support Vision Zero with aligned\ninterventions and advanced

While critical testing scenario\ngeneration has emerged as an appealing verification methodology, effectively\nbalancing diversity and criticality remains a key challenge for existing\nmethods, particularly due to local optima entrapment in high-dimensional\nscenario spaces. To address this limitation, we propose a dual-space guided\ntesting framework that coordinates scenario parameter space and agent behavior\nspace, aiming to generate testing scenarios considering diversity and\ncriticality. Specifically, in the scenario parameter space, a hierarchical\nrepresentation framework combines dimensionality reduction and\nmulti-dimensional subspace evaluation to efficiently localize diverse and\ncritical subspaces. This guides dynamic coordination between two generation\nmodes: local perturbation and global exploration, optimizing critical scenario\nquantity and diversity. Complementarily, in the agent behavior space,\nagent-environment interaction data are leveraged to quantify behavioral\ncriticality/diversity and adaptively support generation mode switching, forming\na closed feedback loop that continuously enhances scenario characterization and\nexploration within the parameter space. Experiments show our framework improves\ncritical scenario generation by an average of 56.23\\% and demonstrates greater\ndiversity under novel parameter-behavior co-driven metrics when tested on five\ndecision-making agents, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub2e4\uc774\ub098\ubbf9 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815

In the infinite-width limit, NTKs can easily be\ncomputed for most common architectures, yielding full analytic control over the\ntraining dynamics. However, at infinite width, important properties of training\nsuch as NTK evolution or feature learning are absent. Nevertheless, finite\nwidth effects can be included by computing corrections to the Gaussian\nstatistics at infinite width. We introduce Feynman diagrams for computing\nfinite-width corrections to NTK statistics. These dramatically simplify the\nnecessary algebraic manipulations and enable the computation of layer-wise\nrecursive relations for arbitrary statistics involving preactivations, NTKs and\ncertain higher-derivative tensors (dNTK and ddNTK) required to predict the\ntraining dynamics at leading order. We demonstrate the feasibility of our\nframework by extending stability results for deep networks from preactivations\nto NTKs and proving the absence of finite-width corrections for scale-invariant\nnonlinearities such as ReLU on the diagonal of the Gram matrix of the NTK.

In\nthis paper, we present a new approach for learning the physics-dependent\ntemporal distribution of multivariate time series data using a weighted\nphysics-informed loss during diffusion model training. A weighted\nphysics-informed loss is constructed using a static weight schedule. This\napproach enables a diffusion model to accurately approximate underlying data\ndistribution, which can influence the unsupervised anomaly detection\nperformance. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that\nphysics-informed training improves the F1 score in anomaly detection; it\ngenerates better data diversity and log-likelihood.

Notably, while Federated Graph Learning (FGL)\nis tailored for graph data, it is predominantly implemented in a centralized\nserver-client model, failing to leverage the benefits of decentralization.To\nbridge this gap, we propose DFed-SST, a decentralized federated graph learning\nframework with adaptive communication. The core of our method is a\ndual-topology adaptive communication mechanism that leverages the unique\ntopological features of each client's local subgraph to dynamically construct\nand optimize the inter-client communication topology.

We demonstrate the performance of our\nalgorithm on a cubic heat conduction problem, with nested OpInf achieving a\nfour times smaller error than standard OpInf at a comparable offline time.\nFurther, we apply nested OpInf to a large-scale, parameterized model of the\nGreenland ice sheet where, despite model form approximation errors, it learns a\nROM with, on average, 3% error and computational speed-up factor above 19,000.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc2a4\ub0c5\uc0f7 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc815\ubcf4 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ucd95\uc18c\ucc28\uc6d0 \ubaa8\ub378(ROM)\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc911\ucca9 \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc790 \ucd94\ub860(OpInf) \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ucd95\uc18c\ucc28\uc6d0 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574.", "method": "\uc911\ucca9 \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc790 \ucd94\ub860 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc6b0\uc120\uc801\uc778 \uc9c0\ubc30 \ubaa8\ub4dc\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud55c \ucd08\uae30 \ucd94\uc815\uc744 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\ucd95\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc911\ucca9 OpInf\uac00 \ud45c\uc900 OpInf\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub124 \ubc30 \uc791\uc740 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uadf8\ub9b0\ub780\ub4dc \ube59\uc0c1\uc758 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ud654 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \ud3c9\uade0 3% \uc624\ub958\uc640 19,000 \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc18d\ub3c4 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \ub3d9\uc801 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc2a4\ub0c5\uc0f7 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ubb3c\ub9ac \uc815\ubcf4\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \ucd95\uc18c \ucc28\uc6d0 \ubaa8\ub378(ROM)\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \uc911\ucca9 \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc790 \ucd94\ub860(OpInf) \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ucd95\uc18c\ub41c \uacf5\uac04 \ub0b4\uc758 \uace0\uc720\ud55c \uacc4\uce35 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc9c0\ubc30\uc801\uc778 \ubaa8\ub4dc\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc5d0 \uc6b0\uc120 \uc21c\uc704\ub97c \ub450\uace0 OpInf \ud559\uc2b5 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucd08\uae30 \ucd94\uc815\uc744 \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc5b4\ub5a4 \ubaa9\ud45c \ucd95\uc18c \ucc28\uc6d0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uacc4\uc0b0\ub41c \ucd08\uae30 \ucd94\uc815\uce58\ub294 \ud45c\uc900 OpInf\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc2a4\ub0c5\uc0f7 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131 \uc624\ub958\uac00 \uc791\uac70\ub098 \uac19\uc740 ROM\uc5d0 \ud574\ub2f9\ud55c\ub2e4. \uac8c\ub2e4\uac00, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc911\ucca9 OpInf \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \uc774\uc804\uc5d0 \ud559\uc2b5\ub41c \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd08\uae30 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \uc124\uc815\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc5b4 \ub3d9\uc801 \uae30\ucd08 \ubc0f \ubaa8\ub378 \ud615\uc2dd \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc801\uc6a9 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc815\uc721\uba74\uccb4 \uc5f4\uc804\ub3c4 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud588\uc73c\uba70, \uc911\ucca9 OpInf\ub294 \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \ud45c\uc900 OpInf\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub124 \ubc30 \uc791\uc740 \uc624\ub958\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uadf8\ub9b0\ub780\ub4dc \ube59\uc0c1\uc758 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\ud654 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0 \uc911\ucca9 OpInf\ub97c \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378 \ud615\uc2dd \uadfc\uc0ac \uc624\ub958\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \ud3c9\uade0 3% \uc624\ub958\uc640 19,000 \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc18d\ub3c4 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud588\ub2e4."}}

First,\nSeamlessFlow introduces a data plane that decouples the RL trainer from\ndiverse, complex agent implementations while sustaining high throughput. A\ncentral trajectory manager maintains complete interaction histories and\nsupports partial rollout, allowing rollout to pause for weight updates and\nresume seamlessly, keeping agents unaware of service interruptions. Second, we\npropose a tag driven scheduling paradigm that abstracts hardware into\ncapability tagged resources, unifying colocated and disaggregated\narchitectures. Based on this, SeamlessFlow introduces a spatiotemporal\nmultiplexing pipeline that dynamically reassigns idle training nodes to rollout\nin a train rollout separated setup, eliminating pipeline bubbles and fully\nexploiting heterogeneous cluster resources.

Hosseini"], "title": "Optimal CO2 storage management considering safety constraints in multi-stakeholder multi-site CCS projects: a game theoretic perspective", "comment": "38 pages, 16 figures", "summary": "Carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects typically involve a diverse array\nof stakeholders or players from public, private, and regulatory sectors, each\nwith different objectives and responsibilities. Given the complexity, scale,\nand long-term nature of CCS operations, determining whether individual\nstakeholders can independently maximize their interests or whether\ncollaborative coalition agreements are needed remains a central question for\neffective CCS project planning and management. CCS projects are often\nimplemented in geologically connected sites, where shared geological features\nsuch as pressure space and reservoir pore capacity can lead to competitive\nbehavior among stakeholders. Furthermore, CO2 storage sites are often located\nin geologically mature basins that previously served as sites for hydrocarbon\nextraction or wastewater disposal in order to leverage existing\ninfrastructures, which makes unilateral optimization even more complicated and\nunrealistic.\n  In this work, we propose a paradigm based on Markov games to quantitatively\ninvestigate how different coalition structures affect the goals of\nstakeholders. We frame this multi-stakeholder multi-site problem as a\nmulti-agent reinforcement learning problem with safety constraints. Our\napproach enables agents to learn optimal strategies while compliant with safety\nregulations. We present an example where multiple operators are injecting CO2\ninto their respective project areas in a geologically connected basin. To\naddress the high computational cost of repeated simulations of high-fidelity\nmodels, a previously developed surrogate model based on the Embed-to-Control\n(E2C) framework is employed. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed framework in addressing optimal management of CO2 storage when\nmultiple stakeholders with various objectives and goals are involved.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud0c4\uc18c \ud3ec\uc9d1 \ubc0f \uc800\uc7a5(CCS) \ud504\ub85c\uc81d\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\ud574\uad00\uacc4\uc790 \uac04\uc758 \ud611\ub825 \ubc0f \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub9c8\ub974\ucf54\ud504 \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "CCS \ud504\ub85c\uc81d\ud2b8\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\uc131\uacfc \uc7a5\uae30\uc801\uc778 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud560 \ub54c, \uc774\ud574\uad00\uacc4\uc790\ub4e4\uc774 \ub3c5\ub9bd\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\uc775\uc744 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0 \ud611\ub825\uc801\uc778 \uc5f0\ud569 \uacc4\uc57d\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud55c\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc9c8\ubb38\uc740 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ud504\ub85c\uc81d\ud2b8 \uacc4\ud68d \ubc0f \uad00\ub9ac\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec \uacfc\uc81c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc5ec\ub7ec \uc774\ud574\uad00\uacc4\uc790\uc640 \uc0ac\uc774\ud2b8\uac00 \ud3ec\ud568\ub41c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc548\uc804 \uc81c\uc57d\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubb38\uc81c\ub85c \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\uace0, E2C \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ub300\uccb4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ucd5c\uc801 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ud559\uc2b5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc5ec\ub7ec \ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \uc774\ud574\uad00\uacc4\uc790\ub4e4\uc774 \ud3ec\ud568\ub41c \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c CO2 \uc800\uc7a5 \uad00\ub9ac\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 CCS \ud504\ub85c\uc81d\ud2b8\uc758 \uc774\ud574\uad00\uacc4\uc790 \uac04 \ud611\ub825\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uacfc \uace0\uae09 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ubc18\ubcf5 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ube44\uc6a9 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud0c4\uc18c \ud3ec\uc9d1 \ubc0f \uc800\uc7a5(\u0421\u0421S) \ud504\ub85c\uc81d\ud2b8\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uacf5\uacf5, \ubbfc\uac04 \ubc0f \uaddc\uc81c \ubd80\ubb38\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc774\ud574\uad00\uacc4\uc790\ub4e4\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uac01\uae30 \ub2e4\ub978 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc640 \ucc45\uc784\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.
