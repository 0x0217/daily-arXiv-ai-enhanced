Yet, though prior work has shown LLMs to be\ncapable of identifying emotional connections and recognizing reciprocity in\ntrust games, little remains known about (i) how different strategies to build\ntrust compare, (ii) how such trust can be measured implicitly, and (iii) how\nthis relates to explicit measures of trust.\n  We study these questions by relating implicit measures of trust, i.e.\nsusceptibility to persuasion and propensity to collaborate financially, with\nexplicit measures of trust, i.e. a dyadic trust questionnaire well-established\nin psychology. We build trust in three ways: by building rapport dynamically,\nby starting from a prewritten script that evidences trust, and by adapting the\nLLMs' system prompt. Surprisingly, we find that the measures of explicit trust\nare either little or highly negatively correlated with implicit trust measures.\nThese findings suggest that measuring trust between LLMs by asking their\nopinion may be deceiving. Instead, context-specific and implicit measures may\nbe more informative in understanding how LLMs trust each other.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4

Recent findings, however, show that the original theoretical variant\nof CCBS can suffer from non-termination, while the widely used implementation\ncan return sub-optimal solutions. We introduce an analytical framework that\nyields simple and sufficient conditions under which any CCBS-style algorithm is\nboth sound, i.e., returns only optimal solutions, and solution complete, i.e.,\nterminates on every solvable MAPFR instance. Investigating the publicly\navailable implementation of CCBS reveals that it violates these conditions.\nThough this merely indicates that CCBS might be unsound, this indication is\nsupported by counter-examples.\n  Leveraging the analytical framework, we propose a novel branching rule and\nprove that it satisfies the sufficient conditions, thereby restoring soundness\nand termination guarantees. Consequently, the resulting CCBS variant is both\nsound and solution complete, matching the guarantees of the discrete-time CBS\nfor the first time in the continuous domain. We experimentally apply standard\nCCBS and CCBS under our branching rule to an example problem, with our\nbranching rule returning a solution with lower sum-of-costs than standard CCBS.\nBecause the branching rule largely only affects the branching step, it can be\nadopted as a drop-in replacement in existing code-bases, as we show in our\nprovided implementation. Beyond CCBS, the analytical framework and termination\ncriterion provide a systematic way to evaluate other CCBS-like MAPFR solvers\nand future extensions.", "AI": {"tldr": "CCBS\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911

One of the caveats of using\nJAX to achieve such scaling is that the shapes of arrays used in the\ncomputational model should remain immutable throughout the simulation. In the\ncontext of agent-based modeling (ABM), this can pose constraints on certain\nagent manipulation operations that require flexible data structures.

On the canonical predation model benchmark, Abmax achieves\nruntime performance comparable to state-of-the-art implementations.

This paper examines the\ntransformative potential of zero trust architecture for enhancing security and\nresilience within this critical ecosystem. We explore the challenges posed by\ndata breaches, counterfeiting, and disruptions and introduce the principles of\ncontinuous verification, least-privilege access, and data-centric security\ninherent in zero trust. Real-world case studies illustrate successful\nimplementations. Benefits include heightened security, data protection, and\nadaptable resilience. As recognized by researchers and industrialists, a\nreliable drug tracing system is crucial for ensuring drug safety throughout the\npharmaceutical production process. One of the most pivotal domains within the\npharmaceutical industry and its associated supply chains where zero trust can\nbe effectively implemented is in the management of narcotics, high-health-risk\ndrugs, and abusable substances.

However, this progress has come at the cost of increasingly large model\nsizes, which pose significant challenges for deployment, scalability, and\nenergy efficiency. To address these limitations, post-training pruning has\nemerged as a promising approach for reducing model size and inference latency\nwithout the need for retraining. Despite these advantages, many existing\npruning methods result in substantial performance degradation or require\ncomputationally expensive fine-tuning. In this work, we introduce Z-Pruner, a\nnovel post-training pruning method designed to induce sparsity in pretrained\nLLMs without any retraining. Unlike conventional approaches, Z-Pruner leverages\nboth weight update magnitudes and activation patterns to identify and eliminate\nredundant parameters more effectively. Our method is model-agnostic, efficient,\nand easy to implement. We evaluate Z-Pruner using multiple widely-used LLM\narchitectures, including LLaMA-2, LLaMA-3, and OPT, across a diverse set of\nstandard language benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that Z-Pruner\nsurpasses state-of-the-art pruning methods that require intensive weight\nupdates. Specifically, Z-Pruner achieves the lowest perplexity scores and the\nhighest overall average score for zero-shot accuracy.

However, its vulnerability to\nbackdoor attacks presents a significant security concern. Existing backdoor\nattack methods on LD often exhibit limited practical utility due to the\nartificial and conspicuous nature of their triggers. To address this limitation\nand investigate the impact of more ecologically valid backdoor attacks on LD\nmodels, we examine the common data poisoning attack and introduce DBALD, a\nnovel diffusion-based data poisoning framework for generating naturalistic\nbackdoor triggers. DBALD comprises two key components: optimal trigger position\nfinding and stealthy trigger generation. Given the insight that attack\nperformance varies depending on the trigger position, we propose a\nheatmap-based method to identify the optimal trigger location, with gradient\nanalysis to generate attack-specific heatmaps. A region-based editing diffusion\nprocess is then applied to synthesize visually plausible triggers within the\nmost susceptible regions identified previously. Furthermore, to ensure scene\nintegrity and stealthy attacks, we introduce two loss strategies: one for\npreserving lane structure and another for maintaining the consistency of the\ndriving scene.

Our framework incorporates three primary innovations.\nFirstly, we propose a Progressive Intra-Layer Fusion paradigm, where a\nCross-Attention mechanism empowers the textual representation to dynamically\nquery and integrate non-linguistic features from audio and visual streams\nwithin the deep layers of a Transformer encoder. This enables a deeper,\ncontext-dependent fusion process. Secondly, the model incorporates an Adaptive\nGated Arbitration mechanism, which acts as a dynamic controller to balance the\noriginal linguistic information against the newly fused multimodal context,\nensuring stable and meaningful integration while preventing noise from\noverwhelming the signal. Lastly, a hybrid Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning\n(PEFT) strategy is employed, synergistically combining global adaptation via\nLoRA with local refinement through Post-Fusion Adapters. This significantly\nreduces trainable parameters, making the model lightweight and suitable for\nresource-limited scenarios. These innovations are integrated into a\nhierarchical encoder architecture, enabling PGF-Net to perform deep, dynamic,\nand interpretable multimodal sentiment analysis while maintaining exceptional\nparameter efficiency.

For defenders, arguments are often made that AI will\nenable solutions like formal verification of all software--and for some\nwell-equipped companies, this may be true. This conversation, however, does not\nmatch the reality for most companies. \"Trailing-edge organizations,\" as we term\nthem, rely heavily on legacy software, poorly staff security roles, and\nstruggle to implement best practices like rapid deployment of security patches.\nThese decisions may be the result of corporate inertia, but may also be the\nresult of a seemingly-rational calculation that attackers may not bother\ntargeting a firm due to lack of economic incentives, and as a result,\nunderinvestment in defense will not be punished.\n  This approach to security may have been sufficient prior to the development\nof AI systems, but it is unlikely to remain viable in the near future. We argue\nthat continuing improvements in AI's capabilities poses additional risks on two\nfronts: First, increased usage of AI will alter the economics of the marginal\ncyberattack and expose these trailing-edge organizations to more attackers,\nmore frequently. Second, AI's advances will enable attackers to develop\nexploits and launch attacks earlier than they can today--meaning that it is\ninsufficient for these companies to attain parity with today's leading\ndefenders, but must instead aim for faster remediation timelines and more\nresilient software. The situation today portends a dramatically increased\nnumber of attacks in the near future. Moving forward, we offer a range of\nsolutions for both organizations and governments to improve the defensive\nposture of firms which lag behind their peers today.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI\uc758

However, many\nexisting ECG segmentation models rely on complex, multi-layered architectures\nsuch as BiLSTM, which are computationally intensive and inefficient. This study\nintroduces a streamlined architecture that combines spectral analysis with\nprobabilistic predictions for ECG signal segmentation. By replacing complex\nlayers with simpler ones, the model effectively captures both temporal and\nspectral features of the P, QRS, and T waves. Additionally, an Explainable AI\n(XAI) approach is applied to enhance model interpretability by explaining how\ntemporal and frequency-based features contribute to ECG segmentation. By\nincorporating principles from physics-based AI, this method provides a clear\nunderstanding of the decision-making process, ensuring reliability and\ntransparency in ECG analysis. This approach achieves high segmentation\naccuracy: 97.00% for the QRS wave, 93.33% for the T wave, and 96.07% for the P\nwave. These results indicate that the simplified architecture not only improves\ncomputational efficiency but also provides precise segmentation, making it a\npractical and effective solution for heart signal monitoring.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 ECG \uc2e0\ud638 \ubd84\ud560\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uac04\uc18c\ud654\ub41c \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ub192\uc740 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uacc4\uc0b0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 ECG \ubd84\ud560 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud558\uace0 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ub2e4\uce35 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc \ubd84\uc11d\uacfc \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \uac04\uc18c\ud654\ub41c \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec P, QRS, T\ud30c\uc758 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \ubc0f \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc\uc801 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \ucea1\ucc98\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "QRS\ud30c 97.00%, T\ud30c 93.33%, P\ud30c 96.07%\uc758 \ub192\uc740 \ubd84\ud560 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 ECG \uc2e0\ud638 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc2ec\uc7a5\uc758 \uc804\uae30\uc801 \ud65c\ub3d9\uc740 \uc2ec\uc804\ub3c4(ECG)\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uae30\ub85d\ub418\uba70, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc2ec\ud608\uad00 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \uc9c4\ub2e8\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ub9ce\uc740 \uae30\uc874 ECG \ubd84\ud560 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc9d1\uc57d\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 BiLSTM\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub2e4\uce35 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 ECG \uc2e0\ud638 \ubd84\ud560\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc \ubd84\uc11d\uacfc \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud55c \uac04\uc18c\ud654\ub41c \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\ub97c \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \ub808\uc774\uc5b4\ub85c \ub300\uccb4\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 P, QRS \ubc0f T\ud30c\uc758 \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \ubc0f \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc\uc801 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3ec\ucc29\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \ubc0f \uc8fc\ud30c\uc218 \uae30\ubc18 \ud2b9\uc131\uc774 ECG \ubd84\ud560\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uae30\uc5ec\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc124\uba85\ud558\uc5ec \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc124\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c AI(XAI) \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \uc801\uc6a9\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubb3c\ub9ac \uae30\ubc18 AI\uc758 \uc6d0\uce59\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uc5ec \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uba85\ud655\ud558\uac8c \uc774\ud574\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\uc5ec ECG \ubd84\uc11d\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uacfc \ud22c\uba85\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 QRS\ud30c 97.00%, T\ud30c 93.33%, P\ud30c 96.07%\uc758 \ub192\uc740 \ubd84\ud560 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uac04\uc18c\ud654\ub41c \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uac00 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud560 \ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uc815\ubc00\ud55c \ubd84\ud560\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc5ec \uc2ec\uc7a5 \uc2e0\ud638 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc784\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Existing methods\ntypically rely on sequential retrieval and reasoning, where each step builds on\nthe previous output. However, this single-path paradigm makes them vulnerable\nto errors due to misleading intermediate steps. Moreover, developing multimodal\nmodels can be computationally expensive, often requiring extensive training. To\naddress these limitations, we propose a training-free framework guided by an\nAdaptive Planning Graph, which consists of planning, retrieval and reasoning\nmodules. The planning module analyzes the current state of the Adaptive\nPlanning Graph, determines the next action and where to expand the graph, which\nenables dynamic and flexible exploration of reasoning paths. To handle\nretrieval of text to unspecified target modalities, we devise modality-specific\nstrategies that dynamically adapt to distinct data types.

In tensor parallelism (TP), however, attention heads are\ncomputed across multiple devices, and each device must load the full cache,\neroding the advantage of MLA over Grouped Query Attention (GQA). We propose\nTensor-Parallel Latent Attention (TPLA): a scheme that partitions both the\nlatent representation and each head's input dimension across devices, performs\nattention independently per shard, and then combines results with an\nall-reduce. TPLA preserves the benefits of a compressed KV cache while\nunlocking TP efficiency. Unlike Grouped Latent Attention (GLA), every head in\nTPLA still leverages the full latent representation, maintaining stronger\nrepresentational capacity. TPLA is drop-in compatible with models pre-trained\nusing MLA: it supports MLA-style prefilling and enables efficient\ntensor-parallel decoding without retraining.

Harnessing this heterogeneity is critical for improving patient\noutcomes. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled\nfoundation models that can learn from multiple data modalities and support\nclinical tasks. However, most current approaches simply serialize numeric EHR\ndata into text, which risks losing temporal and quantitative detail. We\nintroduce Generative Deep Patient (GDP), a multimodal foundation model that\nnatively encodes structured EHR time-series via a CNN-Transformer encoder and\nfuses it with unstructured EHRs through cross-modal attention into a\nLLaMA-based decoder. GDP is trained in two stages: (1) generative pretraining,\nwhere it learns to produce clinical narratives from raw patient timelines while\nalso performing masked feature prediction (MFP) and next time-step prediction\n(NTP) to capture temporal dynamics; and (2) multi-task fine-tuning for\nclinically meaningful predictions (e.g., heart failure, type 2 diabetes, 30-day\nreadmission). In clinical prediction, GDP demonstrated superior performance on\nMIMIC-IV: heart failure AUROC = 0.923, type 2 diabetes AUROC = 0.817, and\n30-day readmission AUROC = 0.627. For narrative generation, GDP achieved\nROUGE-L = 0.135 and BERTScore-F1 = 0.545. In a blinded human evaluation,\nGDP-Instruct scored highest on faithfulness, fluency, and overall clinical\nutility, suggesting reduced hospital documentation workload without sacrificing\naccuracy. Our results demonstrate that a single multimodal foundation model can\nboth predict clinically actionable events and generate high-quality clinical\nnarratives. Furthermore, GDP's flexible architecture can be extended to\nadditional modalities.", "AI": {"tldr": "Generative Deep Patient (GDP)\ub294 \uc804\uc790 \uac74\uac15 \uae30\ub85d(EHRs)\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc784\uc0c1 \uc608\uce21\uacfc \ub0b4\ub7ec\ud2f0\ube0c \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "EHR\uc758 \uc774\uc9c8\uc131\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ud658\uc790 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "GDP\ub294 CNN-Transformer \uc778\ucf54\ub354\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c EHR \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4\uc744 \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ud558\uace0, cross-modal attention\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ube44\uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c EHR\uacfc \uc735\ud569\ud558\uc5ec LLaMA \uae30\ubc18 \ub514\ucf54\ub354\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc784\uc0c1 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0\uc11c GDP\ub294 MIMIC-IV\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4: \uc2ec\ubd80\uc804 AUROC = 0.923, \uc81c2\ud615 \ub2f9\ub1e8\ubcd1 AUROC = 0.817, 30\uc77c \uc7ac\uc785\uc6d0 AUROC = 0.627.", "conclusion": "GDP\ub294 \uc784\uc0c1\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc0ac\uac74\uc744 \uc608\uce21\ud558\uace0 \uace0\ud488\uc9c8 \uc784\uc0c1 \ub0b4\ub7ec\ud2f0\ube0c\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2e8\uc77c \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc804\uc790 \uac74\uac15 \uae30\ub85d(EHRs)\uc740 \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \uc784\uc0c1 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc18c\uc2a4\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc694\uc18c(\uc778\uad6c \ud1b5\uacc4, \uc0dd\uccb4 \uc9d5\ud6c4, \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc2e4 \uacb0\uacfc, \ucf54\ub4dc)\uc640 \ube44\uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uc784\uc0c1 \ub178\ud2b8 \ubc0f \uae30\ud0c0 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud658\uc790 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ub9ac\ud3ec\uc9c0\ud1a0\ub9ac\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc774\uc9c8\uc131\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ud658\uc790 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc\uc758 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLMs) \ubc1c\uc804\uc73c\ub85c \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubaa8\ub2ec\ub9ac\ud2f0\uc5d0\uc11c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\uace0 \uc784\uc0c1 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud574\uc84c\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \ud604\uc7ac \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud788 \uc218\uce58 EHR \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub85c \uc9c1\ub82c\ud654\ud558\uc5ec \uc2dc\uac04\uc801 \ubc0f \uc815\ub7c9\uc801 \uc138\ubd80\uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc783\uac8c \ud560 \uc704\ud5d8\uc774 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 CNN-Transformer \uc778\ucf54\ub354\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c EHR \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4\uc744 \ubcf8\ub798 \uc778\ucf54\ub529\ud558\uace0, LLaMA \uae30\ubc18 \ub514\ucf54\ub354\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ube44\uad6c\uc870\ud654\ub41c EHR\uacfc \uc735\ud569\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378\uc778 Generative Deep Patient (GDP)\ub97c \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Our approach employs a multi-layer Transformer-based time-series\nforecaster to capture long-range, nonlinear temporal relationships among\nvariables. After training, we extract the underlying causal structure and\nassociated time lags from the forecaster using gradient-based analysis,\nenabling the construction of a causal graph. To mitigate the impact of spurious\ncausal relationships, we introduce a prior knowledge integration mechanism\nbased on attention masking, which consistently enforces user-excluded causal\nlinks across multiple Transformer layers.

Although\nexisting evasion methods perform well, they suffer from high computational\ncosts and text quality degradation. To address these challenges, we propose\nSelf-Disguise Attack (SDA), a novel approach that enables Large Language Models\n(LLM) to actively disguise its output, reducing the likelihood of detection by\nclassifiers. The SDA comprises two main components: the adversarial feature\nextractor and the retrieval-based context examples optimizer. The former\ngenerates disguise features that enable LLMs to understand how to produce more\nhuman-like text.

With the astounding\nadvances in large language models (LLMs), a variety of methods have been\ndeveloped to adapt LLMs for time series forecasting. Despite unlocking the\npotential of LLMs in comprehending TS data, existing methods are inherently\nconstrained by their shallow integration of TS information, wherein LLMs\ntypically access TS representations at shallow layers, primarily at the input\nlayer. This causes the influence of TS representations to progressively fade in\ndeeper layers and eventually leads to ineffective adaptation between textual\nembeddings and TS representations. In this paper, we propose the Multi-layer\nSteerable Embedding Fusion (MSEF), a novel framework that enables LLMs to\ndirectly access time series patterns at all depths, thereby mitigating the\nprogressive loss of TS information in deeper layers. Specifically, MSEF\nleverages off-the-shelf time series foundation models to extract semantically\nrich embeddings, which are fused with intermediate text representations across\nLLM layers via layer-specific steering vectors. These steering vectors are\ndesigned to continuously optimize the alignment between time series and textual\nmodalities and facilitate a layer-specific adaptation mechanism that ensures\nefficient few-shot learning capabilities. Experimental results on seven\nbenchmarks demonstrate significant performance improvements by MSEF compared\nwith baselines, with an average reduction of 31.8% in terms of MSE.

Nascimento"], "title": "An Efficient Hybridization of Graph Representation Learning and Metaheuristics for the Constrained Incremental Graph Drawing Problem", "comment": "The paper has been accepted for publication in the European Journal\n  of Operational Research. Supplementary material will be available on the\n  journal website or upon request", "summary": "Hybridizing machine learning techniques with metaheuristics has attracted\nsignificant attention in recent years. Many attempts employ supervised or\nreinforcement learning to support the decision-making of heuristic methods.\nHowever, in some cases, these techniques are deemed too time-consuming and not\ncompetitive with hand-crafted heuristics. This paper proposes a hybridization\nbetween metaheuristics and a less expensive learning strategy to extract the\nlatent structure of graphs, known as Graph Representation Learning (GRL). For\nsuch, we approach the Constrained Incremental Graph Drawing Problem (C-IGDP), a\nhierarchical graph visualization problem. There is limited literature on\nmethods for this problem, for which Greedy Randomized Search Procedures (GRASP)\nheuristics have shown promising results. In line with this, this paper\ninvestigates the gains of incorporating GRL into the construction phase of\nGRASP, which we refer to as Graph Learning GRASP (GL-GRASP). In computational\nexperiments, we first analyze the results achieved considering different node\nembedding techniques, where deep learning-based strategies stood out.

While\nprevious evaluations have explored whether LLMs can infer intentions or detect\ndeception, they often overlook the individualized reasoning styles that\ninfluence how people interpret and act in social contexts. Social deduction\ngames (SDGs) provide a natural testbed for evaluating individualized reasoning\nstyles, where different players may adopt diverse but contextually valid\nreasoning strategies under identical conditions. To address this, we introduce\nInMind, a cognitively grounded evaluation framework designed to assess whether\nLLMs can capture and apply personalized reasoning styles in SDGs. InMind\nenhances structured gameplay data with round-level strategy traces and\npost-game reflections, collected under both Observer and Participant modes. It\nsupports four cognitively motivated tasks that jointly evaluate both static\nalignment and dynamic adaptation. As a case study, we apply InMind to the game\nAvalon, evaluating 11 state-of-the-art LLMs. General-purpose LLMs, even GPT-4o\nfrequently rely on lexical cues, struggling to anchor reflections in temporal\ngameplay or adapt to evolving strategies.

CPS combines sensing and computing elements, often having\nmulti-layer designs with networking, computational, and physical interfaces,\nwhich provide them with enhanced capabilities for a variety of application\nscenarios. However, the combination of physical and computational elements also\nmakes CPS more vulnerable to attacks compared to network-only systems, and the\nresulting impacts of CPS attacks can be substantial. Intelligent intrusion\ndetection systems (IDS) are an effective mechanism by which CPS can be secured,\nbut the majority of current solutions often train and validate on network\ntraffic-only datasets, ignoring the distinct attacks that may occur on other\nsystem layers. In order to address this, we develop an adaptable CPS anomaly\ndetection model that can detect attacks within CPS without the need for\npreviously labeled data. To achieve this, we utilize domain adaptation\ntechniques that allow us to transfer known attack knowledge from a network\ntraffic-only environment to a CPS environment.

Laboratory experiments are conducted to emulate wheel flange wear\ndepth and surrounding temperature fluctuations in different periods of time.\nEmploying collected data, the training of machine learning algorithms that are\nbased on regression models, is dynamically automated. Further experimentation\nresults, using standards procedures, validate the system's efficacy. To enhance\naccuracy, an infinite impulse response filter (IIR) that mitigates vehicle\ndynamics and sensor noise is designed. Filter parameters were computed based on\nspecifications derived from a Fast Fourier Transform analysis of locomotive\nsimulations and emulation experiments data. The results show that the dynamic\nmachine learning algorithm effectively counter sensor nonlinear response to\ntemperature effects, achieving an accuracy of 96.5 %, with a minimal runtime.\nThe real-time noise reduction via IIR filter enhances the accuracy up to 98.2\n%.

Na", "Kibum Kim", "Chanyoung Park"], "title": "IR-Agent: Expert-Inspired LLM Agents for Structure Elucidation from Infrared Spectra", "comment": null, "summary": "Spectral analysis provides crucial clues for the elucidation of unknown\nmaterials. Among various techniques, infrared spectroscopy (IR) plays an\nimportant role in laboratory settings due to its high accessibility and low\ncost. However, existing approaches often fail to reflect expert analytical\nprocesses and lack flexibility in incorporating diverse types of chemical\nknowledge, which is essential in real-world analytical scenarios. In this\npaper, we propose IR-Agent, a novel multi-agent framework for molecular\nstructure elucidation from IR spectra.

Our regret bounds\ngeneralize known results for the existing case of no distribution shift and\nvectorial reward settings, and scale gracefully with problem parameters in\npresence of distribution shifts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubca1\ud130\uac00 \uc8fc\uc5b4\uc9c4 \uc120\ud638 \uc6d0\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc815\ub82c\ub420 \ub54c, \ubd84\ud3ec \uc774\ub3d9 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc801 \ubc34\ub527 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc801 \ubc34\ub527 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uace0 \ubd84\ud3ec \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc801\uc751\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ucc3e\uae30 \uc704\ud568\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc801\uc751\uc801 \uc774\uc0b0\ud654 \ubc0f \ub099\uad00\uc801 \uc81c\uac70 \uae30\ubc18 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \ud2b9\uc815 \uc120\ud638 \uc6d0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc790\uac00 \uc870\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \ubd84\ud3ec \uc774\ub3d9\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774 \uc815\ucc45\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc120\uc5b8\ud558\uba70, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubd84\ud3ec \uc774\ub3d9\uc758 \uc131\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac00\uc815 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \ub099\uad00\uc801 \uaca9\ucc28\uc758 \uc0c1\ud55c\uc744 \uc124\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ub099\uad00\uc801 \uaca9\ucc28 \uacbd\uacc4\ub294 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubd84\ud3ec \uc774\ub3d9 \uc5c6\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ud558\uace0, \ubd84\ud3ec \uc774\ub3d9\uc758 \uc874\uc7ac \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \ubb38\uc81c \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc6b0\uc544\ud558\uac8c \uc2a4\ucf00\uc77c\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubca1\ud130\uac00 \uc8fc\uc5b4\uc9c4 \uc120\ud638 \uc6d0\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc815\ub82c\ub420 \ub54c \ubd84\ud3ec \uc774\ub3d9 \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ub9e5\ub77d\uc801 \ubc34\ub527 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ubd84\ud3ec \uc774\ub3d9\uc5d0 \uc790\uac00 \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc801\uc751\uc801 \uc774\uc0b0\ud654 \ubc0f \ub099\uad00\uc801 \uc81c\uac70 \uae30\ubc18 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc815\ucc45\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uce21\uc815\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud30c\ub808\ud1a0 \uc804\uc120 \uac04\uc758 \uac70\ub9ac \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ucc45\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uce21\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc120\ud638 \uae30\ubc18 \ud6c4\ud68c \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubd84\ud3ec \uc774\ub3d9\uc758 \ubcf8\uc9c8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac00\uc815 \ud558\uc5d0 \uc774 \uc815\ucc45\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uba70 \ud6c4\ud68c\uc758 \uc0c1\ud55c\uc744 \uc124\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud6c4\ud68c \uacbd\uacc4\ub294 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubd84\ud3ec \uc774\ub3d9\uc774 \uc5c6\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uc640 \ubca1\ud130 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc124\uc815\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc54c\ub824\uc9c4 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ud558\uace0 \ubd84\ud3ec \uc774\ub3d9\uc758 \uc874\uc7ac \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \ubb38\uc81c \ub9e4\uac1c\ubcc0\uc218\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc6b0\uc544\ud558\uac8c \ud655\ub300\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

FCN\nintegrates curated data inputs, structured schemas, and provenance-aware\npipelines for food-related claim extraction and validation.

While several\ndirty-label attacks that achieve high attack success rates (ASR) have been\nproposed, clean-label attacks are inherently more difficult. In this paper, we\npropose three sample selection strategies to improve attack effectiveness in\nclean-label scenarios: Minimum, Above50, and Below50. Our strategies identify\nthose samples which the model predicts incorrectly or with low confidence, and\nby injecting backdoor triggers into such samples, we aim to induce a stronger\nassociation between the trigger patterns and the attacker-desired target label.\nWe apply our methods to clean-label variants of four canonical backdoor attacks\n(InsertSent, WordInj, StyleBkd, SynBkd) and evaluate them on three datasets\n(IMDB, SST2, HateSpeech) and four model types (LSTM, BERT, DistilBERT,\nRoBERTa). Results show that the proposed strategies, particularly the Minimum\nstrategy, significantly improve the ASR over random sample selection with\nlittle or no degradation in the model's clean accuracy.

Although\nseveral multimodal reasoning models have been explored in the medical domain,\nmost of them focus exclusively on basic reasoning, which refers to shallow\ninference based on visual feature matching. However, real-world clinical\ndiagnosis extends beyond basic reasoning, demanding reasoning processes that\nintegrate heterogeneous clinical information (such as chief complaints and\nmedical history) with multimodal medical imaging data. To bridge this gap, we\nintroduce MM-Retinal-Reason, the first ophthalmic multimodal dataset with the\nfull spectrum of perception and reasoning. It encompasses both basic reasoning\ntasks and complex reasoning tasks, aiming to enhance visual-centric fundamental\nreasoning capabilities and emulate realistic clinical thinking patterns.\nBuilding upon MM-Retinal-Reason, we propose OphthaReason, the first\nophthalmology-specific multimodal reasoning model with step-by-step reasoning\ntraces. To enable flexible adaptation to both basic and complex reasoning\ntasks, we specifically design a novel method called Uncertainty-Aware Dynamic\nThinking (UADT), which estimates sample-level uncertainty via entropy and\ndynamically modulates the model's exploration depth using a shaped advantage\nmechanism. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on both basic and complex reasoning tasks,\noutperforming general-purpose MLLMs, medical MLLMs, RL-based medical MLLMs, and\nophthalmic MLLMs by at least 24.92\\%, 15.00\\%, 21.20\\%, and 17.66\\%.

However, bad actors can deliver malware through\ncompromised models. Existing defenses such as safer model formats, restrictive\n(but inflexible) loading policies, and model scanners have shortcomings: 44.9%\nof popular models on Hugging Face still use the insecure pickle format, 15% of\nthese cannot be loaded by restrictive loading policies, and model scanners have\nboth false positives and false negatives. Pickle remains the de facto standard\nfor model exchange, and the ML community lacks a tool that offers transparent\nsafe loading.\n  We present PickleBall to help machine learning engineers load pickle-based\nmodels safely. PickleBall statically analyzes the source code of a given\nmachine learning library and computes a custom policy that specifies a safe\nload-time behavior for benign models. PickleBall then dynamically enforces the\npolicy during load time as a drop-in replacement for the pickle module.\nPickleBall generates policies that correctly load 79.8% of benign pickle-based\nmodels in our dataset, while rejecting all (100%) malicious examples in our\ndataset. In comparison, evaluated model scanners fail to identify known\nmalicious models, and the state-of-art loader loads 22% fewer benign models\nthan PickleBall.

However, collecting accurate behavioral data, particularly in\nnewly developed areas, poses significant challenges. Recent advances in\ngenerative agents, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), have shown promise\nin simulating human behaviors without relying on extensive datasets.\nNevertheless, these methods often struggle with generating consistent,\ncontext-sensitive, and realistic behavioral outputs. To address these\nlimitations, this paper introduces the Preference Chain, a novel method that\nintegrates Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LLMs to enhance\ncontext-aware simulation of human behavior in transportation systems.\nExperiments conducted on the Replica dataset demonstrate that the Preference\nChain outperforms standard LLM in aligning with real-world transportation mode\nchoices. The development of the Mobility Agent highlights potential\napplications of proposed method in urban mobility modeling for emerging cities,\npersonalized travel behavior analysis, and dynamic traffic forecasting.

Our findings highlight the urgent need for\ncontinued research, standardization efforts, and coordinated adoption\nstrategies to ensure a secure transition to the quantum-resistant cryptographic\nlandscape.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 9\uac1c\uc758 \uc624\ud508\uc18c\uc2a4 \uc554\ud638\ud654 \ub77c\uc774\ube0c\ub7ec\ub9ac\uc5d0\uc11c \uc591\uc790 \uc800\ud56d \uc554\ud638 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \uc9c0\uc6d0 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc591\uc790 \uc704\ud611\uc5d0 \ub300\ube44\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uae34\uae09\ud55c \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc591\uc790 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305\uc758 \uae09\uc18d\ud55c \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \ud604\ub300 \uc554\ud638 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ud070 \uc704\ud611\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud558\ubbc0\ub85c, \ud3ec\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc591\uc790 \uc554\ud638(PQC)\ub85c\uc758 \uc804\ud658\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "NIST\uc5d0\uc11c \uc120\uc815\ud55c PQC \ud6c4\ubcf4 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc778 CRYSTALS-Kyber, CRYSTALS-Dilithium, FALCON, SPHINCS+\uc758 \uad6c\ud604\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0, \ucd5c\uc2e0 \ubb38\uc11c\uc640 \uc0b0\uc5c5 \ubcf4\uace0\uc11c\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \uc554\ud638\ud654 \ub77c\uc774\ube0c\ub7ec\ub9ac\uc758 PQC \uc9c0\uc6d0 \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc870\uc0ac \uacb0\uacfc, \uc77c\ubd80 \ub77c\uc774\ube0c\ub7ec\ub9ac\ub294 PQC \uc9c0\uc6d0\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uba85\ud655\ud55c \uad6c\ud604 \ub85c\ub4dc\ub9f5\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \ubc18\uba74, \ub2e4\ub978 \ub77c\uc774\ube0c\ub7ec\ub9ac\ub294 \ub4a4\ucc98\uc838 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc591\uc790 \uc704\ud611\uc774 \ub2e4\uac00\uc634\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801\uc778 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc704\ud5d8\uc774 \uc874\uc7ac\ud568\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc591\uc790 \uc800\ud56d \uc554\ud638 \ud658\uacbd\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \uc804\ud658\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uc5f0\uad6c, \ud45c\uc900\ud654 \ub178\ub825 \ubc0f \ud611\ub825\uc801 \ucc44\ud0dd \uc804\ub7b5\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc591\uc790 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305\uc758 \uae09\uc18d\ud55c \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \ud604\ub300 \uc554\ud638 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ud070 \uc704\ud611\uc744 \uac00\ud558\uc5ec \ud3ec\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc591\uc790 \uc554\ud638(PQC)\ub85c\uc758 \uc804\ud658\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 NIST\uc5d0\uc11c \uc120\uc815\ud55c PQC \ucd5c\uc885 \ud6c4\ubcf4\uc778 CRYSTALS-Kyber, CRYSTALS-Dilithium, FALCON, SPHINCS+\uc758 \uad6c\ud604\uc5d0 \uc911\uc810\uc744 \ub450\uace0, 9\uac1c\uc758 \ub110\ub9ac \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \uc624\ud508\uc18c\uc2a4 \uc554\ud638\ud654 \ub77c\uc774\ube0c\ub7ec\ub9ac(OpenSSL, wolfSSL, BoringSSL, LibreSSL, Bouncy Castle, libsodium, Crypto++, Botan, MbedTLS)\uc5d0\uc11c PQC \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc9c0\uc6d0\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uc2e0 \ubb38\uc11c, \ub9b4\ub9ac\uc2a4 \ub178\ud2b8 \ubc0f \uc0b0\uc5c5 \ubcf4\uace0\uc11c\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \ubd84\uc11d \uacb0\uacfc, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub77c\uc774\ube0c\ub7ec\ub9ac\ub4e4 \uac04\uc5d0\ub294 \uc900\ube44 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uac00 \ub2e4\uc591\ud558\uac8c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc77c\ubd80 \ub77c\uc774\ube0c\ub7ec\ub9ac\ub294 PQC \uc9c0\uc6d0\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud588\uac70\ub098 \uba85\ud655\ud55c \uad6c\ud604 \ub85c\ub4dc\ub9f5\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \ubc18\uba74, \ub2e4\ub978 \ub77c\uc774\ube0c\ub7ec\ub9ac\ub4e4\uc740 \ub4a4\uccd0\uc838 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc591\uc790 \uc704\ud611\uc774 \ub354 \uac00\uae4c\uc6cc\uc9d0\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801\uc778 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc704\ud5d8\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ub4dc\uc624\ud504, \uad6c\ud604 \ubcf4\uc548, \uc2e4\uc81c \uc554\ud638\ud654 \uc751\uc6a9 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ucc44\ud0dd \uc7a5\ubcbd\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc8fc\uc694 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \ub17c\uc758\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc591\uc790 \uc800\ud56d \uc554\ud638 \ud658\uacbd\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \uc804\ud658\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uacc4\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uc5f0\uad6c, \ud45c\uc900\ud654 \ub178\ub825 \ubc0f \ud611\ub825\uc801\uc778 \ucc44\ud0dd \uc804\ub7b5\uc758 \uae34\uae09\ud55c \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

The mathematical and conceptual results are diverse and span various\nmathematical fields, but the inspiring motivation is unified. The aim is to\nintroduce layers that are mathematically modeled as non-compact symmetric\nspaces, each mapped onto the next one by solvable group homomorphisms. In\nparticular, in the spirit of Convolutional neural networks, we have introduced\nthe notion of Tits Satake (TS) vector bundles where the TS submanifold is the\nbase space. Within this framework, the tiling of the base manifold, the\nrepresentation of bundle sections using harmonics, and the need for a general\ntheory of separator walls motivated a series of mathematical investigations\nthat produced both definite and partial results. Specifically, we present the\ngroup theoretical construction of the separators for all non-compact symmetric\nspaces $\\mathrm{U/H}$, as well as of the $\\Delta_{8,3,2}$ tiling group and its\nnormal Fuchsian subgroups, respectively yielding the uniformization of the\ngenus $g=3$ Fermat Quartic and of the genus $g=2$ Bolza surface. The quotient\nautomorphic groups are studied. Furthermore, we found a new representation of\nthe Laplacian Green function and the Heat Kernel on Hyperbolic Spaces\n$\\mathbb{H}^{n}$, and a setup for the construction of the harmonic functions in\nterms of the spinor representation of pseudo-orthogonal groups. Finally, to\nobtain an explicit construction of the Laplacian eigenfunctions on the Bolza\nRiemann surface, we propose and conjecture a new strategy relying on the\nAbel-Jacobi map of the Riemann surface to its Jacobian variety and the Siegel\nTheta function.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 Cartan \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \uacc4\uc18d\ud558\uba70, \ub2e4\uc74c \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc218\ud559\uc801 \uae30\ucd08 \uc694\uc18c\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "motivation": "Cartan \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc758 \ub2e4\uc74c \ub2e8\uacc4\ub85c \ub098\uc544\uac00\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc218\ud559\uc801 \uae30\ucd08 \uc694\uc18c\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\ube44\ubcf5\ud569 \ub300\uce6d \uacf5\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ud559\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ub41c \uce35\ub4e4\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uad70 \ub3d9\ud615\uc0ac\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \uc11c\ub85c \uc5f0\uacb0\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ubaa8\ub4e0 \ube44\ubcf5\ud569 \ub300\uce6d \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubd84\ub9ac\uc790\uc758 \uad70 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uc600\uace0, \uc77c\uc815\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\uc640 \ubd80\ubd84 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Riemann \uace1\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \ub77c\ud50c\ub77c\uc2dc \uace0\uc720\ud568\uc218\ub97c \uc5bb\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc138 \uac1c\uc758 \uc774\uc804 \ubc1c\ud45c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\uc791\ub41c Cartan \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \uacc4\uc18d\ud558\uba70, \ub2e4\uc74c \ub2e8\uacc4\ub85c \ub098\uc544\uac00\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc218\ud559\uc801 \uae30\ucd08 \uce21\uba74\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc218\ud559\uc801 \ubc0f \uac1c\ub150\uc801 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud558\uace0 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc218\ud559 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc601\uac10\uc744 \uc8fc\ub294 \ub3d9\uae30\ub294 \ud1b5\uc77c\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubaa9\ud45c\ub294 \ube44\ubcf5\ud569 \ub300\uce6d \uacf5\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ud559\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ub41c \uce35\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0, \uac01 \uce35\uc744 \ud574\uacb0 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uad70 \ub3d9\ud615\uc0ac\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\uc74c \uce35\uc5d0 \ub9e4\ud551\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788, \ud569\uc131\uacf1 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\uc758 \uc815\uc2e0\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c, TS \ud558\uc704 \ub2e4\uc591\uccb4\uac00 \uae30\ubcf8 \uacf5\uac04\uc778 Tits Satake (TS) \ubca1\ud130 \ubc88\ub4e4\uc758 \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\ubcf8 \ub2e4\uc591\uccb4\uc758 \ud0c0\uc77c\ub9c1, \uc870\ud654 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c \ubc88\ub4e4 \uc139\uc158\uc758 \ud45c\ud604, \ubd84\ub9ac\ubcbd\uc758 \uc77c\ubc18 \uc774\ub860\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc2dc\ub9ac\uc988\uc758 \uc218\ud559\uc801 \uc870\uc0ac\ub97c \ucd09\ubc1c\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uba85\ud655\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\uc640 \ubd80\ubd84\uc801\uc778 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uac00\uc838\uc654\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ube44\ubcf5\ud569 \ub300\uce6d \uacf5\uac04 $\text{U/H}$\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubd84\ub9ac\uc790\uc758 \uad70 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, $\text{\u0394}_{8,3,2}$ \ud0c0\uc77c\ub9c1 \uad70\uacfc \uadf8\uac83\uc758 \uc815\uc0c1 Fuchsian \ubd80\ubd84\uad70\ub3c4 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uc5ec \uac01\uac01 $g=3$ Fermat Quartic\uc758 \uade0\uc77c\ud654\uc640 $g=2$ Bolza \ud45c\uba74\uc758 \uade0\uc77c\ud654\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubab9\uc2dc \uacf5\ub9ac\ub97c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uc600\uace0, \ub610\ud55c \ud558\uc774\ud37c \ubcfc\ub9ad \uacf5\uac04 $\text{H}^{n}$\uc5d0\uc11c \ub77c\ud50c\ub77c\uc2dc \uadf8\ub9b0 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \uc0c8\ub86d\uac8c \ud45c\ud604\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc900\uc9c1\uad50 \uad70\uc758 \uc2a4\ud53c\ub108 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\ud654 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc124\uc815\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c, Bolza Riemann \uace1\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \ub77c\ud50c\ub77c\uc2dc \uace0\uc720 \ud568\uc218\ub97c \uc5bb\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uba85\uc2dc\uc801\uc778 \uad6c\uc131\uc744 \uc5bb\uae30 \uc704\ud574, Riemann \uace1\uba74\uc758 Abel-Jacobi \ub9f5\uacfc Siegel Theta \ud568\uc218\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0 \ucd94\uce21\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

However,\nexisting methods require manually partitioning model parameters into fixed\ngroups for merging, which restricts the exploration of potential combinations\nand limits performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose Model Merging\nof Natural Niches (M2N2), an evolutionary algorithm with three key features:\n(1) dynamic adjustment of merging boundaries to progressively explore a broader\nrange of parameter combinations; (2) a diversity preservation mechanism\ninspired by the competition for resources in nature, to maintain a population\nof diverse, high-performing models that are particularly well-suited for\nmerging; and (3) a heuristicbased attraction metric to identify the most\npromising pairs of models for fusion. Our experimental results demonstrate, for\nthe first time, that model merging can be used to evolve models entirely from\nscratch. Specifically, we apply M2N2 to evolve MNIST classifiers from scratch\nand achieve performance comparable to CMA-ES, while being computationally more\nefficient. Furthermore, M2N2 scales to merge specialized language and image\ngeneration models, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Notably, it\npreserves crucial model capabilities beyond those explicitly optimized by the\nfitness function, highlighting its robustness and versatility.

However,\ndespite growing research on physical attacks on sensors, our understanding of\nsensor hardware vulnerabilities remains fragmented due to the ad-hoc nature of\nthis field. Moreover, the infinite attack signal space further complicates\nthreat abstraction and defense. To address this gap, we propose a\nsystematization framework, termed sensor out-of-band (OOB) vulnerabilities,\nthat for the first time provides a comprehensive abstraction for sensor attack\nsurfaces based on underlying physical principles. We adopt a bottom-up\nsystematization methodology that analyzes OOB vulnerabilities across three\nlevels. At the component level, we identify the physical principles and\nlimitations that contribute to OOB vulnerabilities. At the sensor level, we\ncategorize known attacks and evaluate their practicality. At the system level,\nwe analyze how CPS features such as sensor fusion, closed-loop control, and\nintelligent perception impact the exposure and mitigation of OOB threats. Our\nfindings offer a foundational understanding of sensor hardware security and\nprovide guidance and future directions for sensor designers, security\nresearchers, and system developers aiming to build more secure sensors and CPS.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc13c\uc11c \ud558\ub4dc\uc6e8\uc5b4\uc758 \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c

In this paper, we introduce PAC-MCoFL,\na game-theoretic multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework where SPs\nact as agents to jointly optimize client assignment, adaptive quantization, and\nresource allocation. Within the framework, we integrate Pareto Actor-Critic\n(PAC) principles with expectile regression, enabling agents to conjecture\noptimal joint policies to achieve Pareto-optimal equilibria while modeling\nheterogeneous risk profiles. To manage the high-dimensional action space, we\ndevise a ternary Cartesian decomposition (TCAD) mechanism that facilitates\nfine-grained control. Further, we develop PAC-MCoFL-p, a scalable variant\nfeaturing a parameterized conjecture generator that substantially reduces\ncomputational complexity with a provably bounded error. Alongside theoretical\nconvergence guarantees, our framework's superiority is validated through\nextensive simulations -- PAC-MCoFL achieves approximately 5.8% and 4.2%\nimprovements in total reward and hypervolume indicator (HVI), respectively,\nover the latest MARL solutions.

The methodology applied is based on a system of six primary\ncriteria (C1-C6), each assessed through a specific \"game\", divided into four\narenas that explore both the human dimension and its transposition into AI. All\ndecisions and actions of the entity are recorded in a standardized AI Journal,\nthe primary source for calculating composite scores. The assessment uses the\nprior expert method to establish initial weights, and the global score -- Grow\nUp Index -- is calculated as the arithmetic mean of the six scores, with\ninterpretation on maturity thresholds. The results show that the methodology\nallows for a coherent and comparable assessment of the level of \"growth\" of AI\nentities, regardless of their type (robots, software agents, LLMs). The\nmulti-game structure highlights strengths and vulnerable areas, and the use of\na unified journal guarantees traceability and replicability in the evaluation.\nThe originality of the work lies in the conceptual transposition of the process\nof \"growing\" from the human world to that of artificial intelligence, in an\nintegrated testing format that combines perspectives from psychology, robotics,\ncomputer science, and ethics.

Braga-Neto"], "title": "A State-Space Approach to Nonstationary Discriminant Analysis", "comment": null, "summary": "Classical discriminant analysis assumes identically distributed training\ndata, yet in many applications observations are collected over time and the\nclass-conditional distributions drift. This population drift renders stationary\nclassifiers unreliable. We propose a principled, model-based framework that\nembeds discriminant analysis within state-space models to obtain nonstationary\nlinear discriminant analysis (NSLDA) and nonstationary quadratic discriminant\nanalysis (NSQDA). For linear-Gaussian dynamics, we adapt Kalman smoothing to\nhandle multiple samples per time step and develop two practical extensions: (i)\nan expectation-maximization (EM) approach that jointly estimates unknown system\nparameters, and (ii) a Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-Kalman method that\nsimultaneously recovers unobserved time labels and parameters, a scenario\ncommon in practice. To address nonlinear or non-Gaussian drift, we employ\nparticle smoothing to estimate time-varying class centroids, yielding fully\nnonstationary discriminant rules. Extensive simulations demonstrate consistent\nimprovements over stationary linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic\ndiscriminant analysis (QDA), and support vector machine (SVM) baselines, with\nrobustness to noise, missing data, and class imbalance.

In line with such an\nevolution, AgentScope introduces major improvements in a new version (1.0),\ntowards comprehensively supporting flexible and efficient tool-based\nagent-environment interactions for building agentic applications. Specifically,\nwe abstract foundational components essential for agentic applications and\nprovide unified interfaces and extensible modules, enabling developers to\neasily leverage the latest progress, such as new models and MCPs. Furthermore,\nwe ground agent behaviors in the ReAct paradigm and offer advanced agent-level\ninfrastructure based on a systematic asynchronous design, which enriches both\nhuman-agent and agent-agent interaction patterns while improving execution\nefficiency. Building on this foundation, we integrate several built-in agents\ntailored to specific practical scenarios. AgentScope also includes robust\nengineering support for developer-friendly experiences. We provide a scalable\nevaluation module with a visual studio interface, making the development of\nlong-trajectory agentic applications more manageable and easier to trace.

This work suggests a new architecture that combines a relay\nchain-driven encryption system with a modified Ciphertext-Policy\nAttribute-Based Encryption (CP-ABE) scheme to tackle the double impediment of\ndynamic access and low-latency communication. The model proposes a\ncontext-aware smart contract on a worldwide relay chain that checks against\ndata properties, including event type, time, and geographical region, to\nspecify the suitable level of encryption policy. From such relay-directed\njudgment, On-Board Units (OBUs) encrypt data end-to-end by utilising CP-ABE and\nstore ciphertext inside localised regional blockchains, preventing dependence\non symmetric encryption or off-chain storage. High-sensitivity events are\nsecured with firm, multi-attribute access rules, whereas common updates use\nlight policies to help reduce processing burdens.

This paper provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for\ntask arithmetic by establishing a connection between task vectors and gradients\nof the task losses. We show that under standard gradient descent, a task vector\ngenerated from one epoch of finetuning is exactly equivalent to the negative\ngradient of the loss, scaled by the learning rate. For the practical\nmulti-epoch setting, we prove that this equivalence holds approximately, with a\nsecond-order error term that we explicitly bound for feed-forward networks. Our\nempirical analysis across seven vision benchmarks corroborates our theory,\ndemonstrating that the first-epoch gradient dominates the finetuning trajectory\nin both norm and direction. A key implication is that merging models finetuned\nfor only a single epoch often yields performance comparable to merging fully\nconverged models.

Teaching Vision-Language-Action Models to Reject the Impossible", "comment": "9 pages, 2 figures, 1 table", "summary": "Recently, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated strong\nperformance on a range of robotic tasks. These models rely on multimodal\ninputs, with language instructions playing a crucial role -- not only in\npredicting actions, but also in robustly interpreting user intent, even when\nthe requests are impossible to fulfill. In this work, we investigate how VLAs\ncan recognize, interpret, and respond to false-premise instructions: natural\nlanguage commands that reference objects or conditions absent from the\nenvironment. We propose Instruct-Verify-and-Act (IVA), a unified framework that\n(i) detects when an instruction cannot be executed due to a false premise, (ii)\nengages in language-based clarification or correction, and (iii) grounds\nplausible alternatives in perception and action.

In\nparticular, as a powerful evolutionary machine learning approach, Genetic\nProgramming (GP) is utilized to evolve human-understandable phase urgency\nfunctions to measure the urgency of activating a green light for a specific\nphase. However, current GP-based methods are unable to treat the common traffic\nfeatures of different traffic signal phases consistently. To address this\nissue, we propose to use a symmetric phase urgency function to calculate the\nphase urgency for a specific phase based on the current road conditions. This\nis represented as an aggregation of two shared subtrees, each representing the\nurgency of a turn movement in the phase. We then propose a GP method to evolve\nthe symmetric phase urgency function. We evaluate our proposed method on the\nwell-known cityflow traffic simulator, based on multiple public real-world\ndatasets. The experimental results show that the proposed symmetric urgency\nfunction representation can significantly improve the performance of the\nlearned traffic signal control policies over the traditional GP representation\non a wide range of scenarios. Further analysis shows that the proposed method\ncan evolve effective, human-understandable and easily deployable traffic signal\ncontrol policies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc720\uc804\uc790

Existing deep learning (DL)-based beam alignment methods often\nneglect the underlying causal relationships between inputs and outputs, leading\nto limited interpretability, poor generalization, and unnecessary beam sweeping\noverhead. In this work, we propose a causally-aware DL framework that\nintegrates causal discovery into beam management pipeline. Particularly, we\npropose a novel two-stage causal beam selection algorithm to identify a minimal\nset of relevant inputs for beam prediction. First, causal discovery learns a\nBayesian graph capturing dependencies between received power inputs and the\noptimal beam. Then, this graph guides causal feature selection for the DL-based\nclassifier. Simulation results reveal that the proposed causal beam selection\nmatches the performance of conventional methods while drastically reducing\ninput selection time by 94.4% and beam sweeping overhead by 59.4% by focusing\nonly on causally relevant features.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 mmWave MIMO \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ube54 \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc778\uacfc \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \uc2ec\uce35 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "6G \ubc0f \uadf8 \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \ud1b5\uc2e0\uc774 \ube60\ub974\uace0 \uc801\uc751 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uba70 \uc2e4\uc138\uacc4 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc5d0 \uacac\ub51c \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ube54 \uc815\ub82c\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc778\uacfc \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \ube54 \uad00\ub9ac \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uc778\uacfc \uc778\uc2dd DL \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \ucd5c\uc18c\ud55c\uc758 \uad00\ub828 \uc785\ub825 \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub450 \ub2e8\uacc4 \uc778\uacfc \ube54 \uc120\ud0dd \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc778\uacfc \ube54 \uc120\ud0dd \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \uc77c\uce58\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc778\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad00\ub828\ub41c \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc5d0\ub9cc \uc9d1\uc911\ud558\uc5ec \uc785\ub825 \uc120\ud0dd \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 94.4% \uc904\uc774\uace0 \ube54 \uc2a4\uc704\ud551 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c 59.4% \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ube54 \uc815\ub82c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uacfc \uad00\uacc4\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70, \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ube54 \uc815\ub82c\uc740 mmWave \ub2e4\uc911 \uc785\ub825 \ub2e4\uc911 \ucd9c\ub825(MIMO) \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c, \ud2b9\ud788 6G \ubc0f \uadf8 \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \ube60\ub974\uace0 \uc801\uc751 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uba70 \uc2e4\uc138\uacc4\uc758 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc5d0 \uac15\ud574\uc57c \ud558\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc694\uad6c\uc0ac\ud56d\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uae4a\uc740 \ud559\uc2b5(DL) \uae30\ubc18 \ube54 \uc815\ub82c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uc785\ub825\uacfc \ucd9c\ub825 \uac04\uc758 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uc778\uacfc \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uac04\uacfc\ud558\uc5ec \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub418\uace0 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\uac00 \uc800\ud558\ub418\uba70 \ubd88\ud544\uc694\ud55c \ube54 \uc2a4\uc704\ud551 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc778\uacfc \ubc1c\uacac\uc744 \ube54 \uad00\ub9ac \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \uc778\uacfc \uc778\uc2dd DL \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ube54 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ucd5c\uc18c\ud55c\uc758 \uad00\ub828 \uc785\ub825 \uc9d1\ud569\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub450 \ub2e8\uacc4 \uc778\uacfc \ube54 \uc120\ud0dd \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uccab\uc9f8, \uc778\uacfc \ubc1c\uacac\uc740 \uc218\uc2e0 \uc804\ub825 \uc785\ub825\uacfc \ucd5c\uc801 \ube54 \uc0ac\uc774\uc758 \uc885\uc18d\uc131\uc744 \ucea1\ucc98\ud558\ub294 \ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7f0 \ub2e4\uc74c \uc774 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub294 DL \uae30\ubc18 \ubd84\ub958\uae30\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc778\uacfc \ud2b9\uc9d5 \uc120\ud0dd\uc744 \uc548\ub0b4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uacb0\uacfc \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc778\uacfc \ube54 \uc120\ud0dd\uc740 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \uc77c\uce58\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc778\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad00\ub828\ub41c \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc5d0\ub9cc \uc9d1\uc911\ud558\uc5ec \uc785\ub825 \uc120\ud0dd \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 94.4% \uc904\uc774\uace0 \ube54 \uc2a4\uc704\ud551 \uc624\ubc84\ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c 59.4% \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ud0b4\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Although these studies\nhave driven the progress in LLMs' safety alignment, it remains unclear whether\nLLMs have internalized authentic knowledge to deal with real-world crimes, or\nare merely forced to simulate toxic language patterns. This ambiguity raises\nconcerns that jailbreak success is often attributable to a hallucination loop\nbetween jailbroken LLM and judger LLM. By decoupling the use of jailbreak\ntechniques, we construct knowledge-intensive Q\\&A to investigate the misuse\nthreats of LLMs in terms of dangerous knowledge possession, harmful task\nplanning utility, and harmfulness judgment robustness. Experiments reveal a\nmismatch between jailbreak success rates and harmful knowledge possession in\nLLMs, and existing LLM-as-a-judge frameworks tend to anchor harmfulness\njudgments on toxic language patterns.

We argue that these principles should form the foundational design\ncriteria for machine learning algorithms dealing with critical medical data,\nincluding survival analysis and risk prediction tasks. Black box models, while\noften highly accurate, struggle to gain trust and regulatory approval in health\ncare due to a lack of transparency. We discuss how intrinsically interpretable\nmodeling approaches (such as kernel methods with sparsity, prototype-based\nlearning, and deep kernel models) can serve as powerful alternatives to opaque\ndeep networks, providing insight into biomedical predictions. We then examine\naccountability in model development, calling for rigorous evaluation, fairness,\nand uncertainty quantification to ensure models reliably support clinical\ndecisions. Finally, we explore how generative AI and collaborative learning\nparadigms (such as federated learning and diffusion-based data synthesis)\nenable reproducible research and cross-institutional integration of\nheterogeneous biomedical data without compromising privacy, hence shareability.\nBy rethinking machine learning foundations along these axes, we can develop\nmedical AI that is not

Experiments\nconducted on the real-world dataset verify the effectiveness of our method.\nFurthermore, the reasoning chain generated during the analysis process can\nincrease interpretability and provide the possibility for practical\napplications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubc95\uc801 \ud310\ub2e8 \uc608\uce21\uc774 \ubc95\ub960 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uc911\uc694\ud574\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ubc95\uc801 \uc9c0\uc2dd \ubd80\uc871\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \ucd94\ub860 \ubd80\uc871 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ubc95\uc801 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2b5\ub4dd\ud558\ub294 GLARE\ub77c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \ubc95\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ubc95\uc801 \ud310\ub2e8 \uc608\uce21\uc774 \ubc95\ub960 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uc911\uc694\ud574\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \uc810\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uba70, \uae30\uc874 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "GLARE\ub77c\ub294 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc744 \ud638\ucd9c\ud558\uc5ec \ubc95\uc801 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2b5\ub4dd\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uc218\ud589\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ubd84\uc11d \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \ucd94\ub860 \uccb4\uc778\uc740 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uace0 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ubc95\uc801 \ud310\ub2e8 \uc608\uce21(LJP)\uc740 \ubc95\ub960 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc810\uc810 \ub354 \uc911\uc694\ud574\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc774 \ubc95\uc801 \uc9c0\uc2dd \ubd80\uc871\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \ucda9\ubd84\uce58 \uc54a\uc740 \ucd94\ub860 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud558\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 GLARE\ub77c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \ubc95\uc801 \ucd94\ub860 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubaa8\ub4c8\uc744 \ud638\ucd9c\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc8fc\uc694 \ubc95\uc801 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2b5\ub4dd\ud558\uc5ec \ucd94\ub860\uc758 \ud3ed\uacfc \uae4a\uc774\ub97c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\uc81c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uc218\ud589\ub41c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc740 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \ubd84\uc11d \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c \ucd94\ub860 \uccb4\uc778\uc740 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uace0 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uc751\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

As a crucial\ntechnique, existing cross-layer KV cache sharing methods either necessitate\nmodified model architectures with subsequent pre-training or incur significant\nperformance degradation at high compression rates. To mitigate these\nchallenges, we propose CommonKV, a training-free method for cross-layer KV\ncache compression through adjacent parameters sharing. Inspired by the high\nsimilarity observed in cross-layer hidden states, we utilize Singular Value\nDecomposition (SVD) to achieve weight sharing across adjacent parameters,\nresulting in a more easily mergeable latent KV cache. Furthermore, we also\nintroduce an adaptive budget allocation strategy. It dynamically assigns\ncompression budgets based on cosine similarity, ensuring that dissimilar caches\nare not over-compressed.

Such proficiency makes VLMs well-suited for\nreal-world applications, enabling robust performance on novel unseen classes\nwithout requiring adaptation. However, fine-tuning remains essential when\ndownstream tasks deviate significantly from the pre-training domain. Prior CL\napproaches primarily focus on preserving the zero-shot capabilities of VLMs\nduring incremental fine-tuning on a downstream task. We take a step further by\ndevising an approach that transforms preservation into enhancement of the\nzero-shot capabilities of VLMs. Our approach, named MoDular Embedding\nRecomposition (MoDER), introduces a modular framework that trains multiple\ntextual experts, each specialized in a single seen class, and stores them in a\nfoundational hub. At inference time, for each unseen class, we query the hub\nand compose the retrieved experts to synthesize a refined prototype that\nimproves classification.

Bridging this gap often requires\nguiding the neural network's output distribution to move closer to the symbolic\nconstraints. While diffusion models have shown remarkable generative capability\nacross various domains, we employ the powerful architecture to perform\nneuro-symbolic learning and solve logical puzzles. Our diffusion-based pipeline\nadopts a two-stage training strategy: the first stage focuses on cultivating\nbasic reasoning abilities, while the second emphasizes systematic learning of\nlogical constraints. To impose hard constraints on neural outputs in the second\nstage, we formulate the diffusion reasoner as a Markov decision process and\ninnovatively fine-tune it with an improved proximal policy optimization\nalgorithm.

In contrast, our method enables\nlow-cost continual adaptation via memory-based online reinforcement learning.\nWe formalise this as a Memory-augmented Markov Decision Process (M-MDP),\nequipped with a neural case-selection policy to guide action decisions. Past\nexperiences are stored in an episodic memory, either differentiable or\nnon-parametric. The policy is continually updated based on environmental\nfeedback through a memory rewriting mechanism, whereas policy improvement is\nachieved through efficient memory reading (retrieval). We instantiate our agent\nmodel in the deep research setting, namely AgentFly, which attains top-1 on\nGAIA validation ($87.88\\%$ Pass@$3$) and $79.40\\%$ on the test set. It reaches\n$66.6\\%$ F1 and $80.4\\%$ PM on the DeepResearcher dataset, outperforming the\nstate-of-the-art training-based method, while case-based memory adds $4.7\\%$ to\n$9.6\\%$ absolute points on out-of-distribution tasks. Our approach offers a\nscalable and efficient pathway for developing generalist LLM agents capable of\ncontinuous, real-time learning without gradient updates, advancing machine\nlearning towards open-ended skill acquisition and deep research scenarios.

In this paper, we\nidentify collapse errors, a previously unrecognized phenomenon in ODE-based\ndiffusion sampling, where the sampled data is overly concentrated in local data\nspace. To quantify this effect, we introduce a novel metric and demonstrate\nthat collapse errors occur across a variety of settings. When investigating its\nunderlying causes, we observe a see-saw effect, where score learning in low\nnoise regimes adversely impacts the one in high noise regimes.

Recently, neural network-based LNS solvers have\nachieved great success in solving Integer Linear Programs (ILPs) by learning to\ngreedily predict the locally optimal solution for the next neighborhood\nproposal. However, this greedy approach raises two key concerns: (1) to what\nextent this greedy proposal suffers from local optima, and (2) how can we\neffectively improve its sample efficiency in the long run. To address these\nquestions, this paper first formulates LNS as a stochastic process, and then\nintroduces SPL-LNS, a sampling-enhanced neural LNS solver that leverages\nlocally-informed proposals to escape local optima.

A significant challenge is\npresented by classifying motor imagery-based electroencephalogram (MI-EEG)\ntasks, given that EEG signals exhibit nonstationarity, time-variance, and\nindividual diversity. Obtaining good classification accuracy is also very\ndifficult due to the growing number of classes and the natural variability\namong individuals. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes a novel method\nfor classifying EEG motor imagery signals that extracts features efficiently\nwith Minimally Random Convolutional Kernel Transform (MiniRocket), a linear\nclassifier then uses the extracted features for activity recognition.\nFurthermore, a novel deep learning based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)\nand Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) architecture to serve as a baseline was\nproposed and demonstrated that classification via MiniRocket's features\nachieves higher performance than the best deep learning models at lower\ncomputational cost.

Most PEFT methods update only a small\nsubset of parameters while freezing the rest, avoiding redundant computation.\nAs they maximize the absolute size of the updates without regard to the\nparameters' original scale, the resulting changes in model behavior can be\nminimal. In contrast, we maximize updates relative to each parameter's scale,\nyielding more meaningful downstream adaptation. We propose Gradient-to-Weight\nRatio and Entropy-guided Masking (GEM), a parameter scale-aware,\ndistribution-sensitive sparse fine-tuning framework.

Therefore, DR techniques focus on preserving either local\nneighborhood structures (local techniques) or global structures such as\npairwise distances between points (global techniques). However, both approaches\ncan mislead analysts to erroneous conclusions about the overall arrangement of\nmanifolds in HD data. For example, local techniques may exaggerate the\ncompactness of individual manifolds, while global techniques may fail to\nseparate clusters that are well-separated in the original space. In this\nresearch, we provide a deeper insight into Uniform Manifold Approximation with\nTwo-phase Optimization (UMATO), a DR technique that addresses this problem by\neffectively capturing local and global structures. UMATO achieves this by\ndividing the optimization process of UMAP into two phases. In the first phase,\nit constructs a skeletal layout using representative points, and in the second\nphase, it projects the remaining points while preserving the regional\ncharacteristics. Quantitative experiments validate that UMATO outperforms\nwidely used DR techniques, including UMAP, in terms of global structure\npreservation, with a slight loss in local structure. We also confirm that UMATO\noutperforms baseline techniques in terms of scalability and stability against\ninitialization and subsampling, making it more effective for reliable HD data\nanalysis.

Physics-Informed\nNeural Networks (PINNs) solve PDEs using deep learning. However, PINNs perform\npointwise predictions that neglect the autoregressive property of dynamical\nsystems, leading to instabilities and inaccurate predictions. We introduce\nPhysics-Informed Autoregressive Networks (PIANO) -- a framework that redesigns\nPINNs to model dynamical systems. PIANO operates autoregressively, explicitly\nconditioning future predictions on the past. It is trained through a\nself-supervised rollout mechanism while enforcing physical constraints.

Northern Nigeria faces high levels of air pollutants, but few studies\nhave systematically compared the performance of advanced machine learning\nmodels under such constraints. This study evaluates Long Short-Term Memory\n(LSTM) networks and the Facebook Prophet model for forecasting multiple\npollutants (CO, SO2, SO4) using monthly observational data from 2018 to 2023\nacross 19 states.

A modern, game-theoretic approach for evaluating data\nquality is the notion of Data Shapley which quantifies the value of individual\ndata points within a dataset. State-of-the-art methods to scale the NP-hard\nShapley computation also face severe challenges when applied to large-scale\ndatasets, limiting their practical use. In this work, we present a Data Shapley\napproach to identify a dataset's high-quality data tuples, Chunked Data Shapley\n(C-DaSh). C-DaSh scalably divides the dataset into manageable chunks and\nestimates the contribution of each chunk using optimized subset selection and\nsingle-iteration stochastic gradient descent. This approach drastically reduces\ncomputation time while preserving high quality results. We empirically\nbenchmark our method on diverse real-world classification and regression tasks,\ndemonstrating that C-DaSh outperforms existing Shapley approximations in both\ncomputational efficiency (achieving speedups between 80x - 2300x) and accuracy\nin detecting low-quality data regions.

Knowledge Tracing\n(KT) models enable this by estimating a student's mastery based on their\nhistorical interactions. Many KT models rely on human-annotated knowledge\nconcepts (KCs), which tag each exercise with one or more skills or concepts\nbelieved to be necessary for solving it. However, these KCs can be incomplete,\nerror-prone, or overly general.\n  In this paper, we propose a deep learning model that learns sparse binary\nrepresentations of exercises, where each bit indicates the presence or absence\nof a latent concept. We refer to these representations as auxiliary KCs. These\nrepresentations capture conceptual structure beyond human-defined annotations\nand are compatible with both classical models (e.g., BKT) and modern deep\nlearning KT architectures.\n  We demonstrate that incorporating auxiliary KCs improves both student\nmodeling and adaptive exercise recommendation. For student modeling, we show\nthat augmenting classical models like BKT with auxiliary KCs leads to improved\npredictive performance.

We\npropose a holistic framework for cyber physical awareness (CPA) in space\nnetworks, pointing out that analyzing reliability and security separately can\nlead to overfitting on system-specific criteria. We structure our proposed\nframework in three main steps. First, we suggest an algorithm that extracts\ncharacteristic properties of the received signal to facilitate an intuitive\nunderstanding of potential threats.

To address this limitation, we created\nand curated eight comprehensive benchmark datasets comprising over 300,000\nverifiable question-and-answer pairs, each targeting critical challenges in\ndrug discovery including target druggability, modality suitability, and drug\nperturbation effects. Using this resource, we developed the OwkinZero models by\npost-training open-source LLMs through a Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable\nRewards strategy. Our results demonstrate that specialized 8-32B OwkinZero\nmodels substantially outperform larger, state-of-the-art commercial LLMs on\nthese biological benchmarks. Remarkably, we uncover evidence of a key aspect of\ngeneralization: specialist models trained on a single task consistently\noutperform their base models on previously unseen tasks. This generalization\neffect is further amplified in our comprehensive OwkinZero models, which were\ntrained on a mixture of datasets and achieve even broader cross-task\nimprovements. This study represents a significant step toward addressing the\nbiological reasoning blind spot in current LLMs, demonstrating that targeted\nreinforcement learning on carefully curated data can

This paper proposes an unsupervised, online learning\nframework that aims to detect two types of faults in WDNs: pipe blockages,\nmodeled as collective anomalies, and background leakages, modeled as concept\ndrift. Our approach combines a Long Short-Term Memory Variational Autoencoder\n(LSTM-VAE) with a dual drift detection mechanism, enabling robust detection and\nadaptation under non-stationary conditions. Its lightweight, memory-efficient\ndesign enables real-time, edge-level monitoring. Experiments on two realistic\nWDNs show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms strong baselines\nin detecting anomalies and adapting to recurrent drift, demonstrating its\neffectiveness in unsupervised event detection for dynamic WDN environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc218\uc6d0 \ubd84\ubc30 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \uacb0\ud568\uc744 \uac10\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ube44\uc9c0\ub3c4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc218\uc6d0 \ubd84\ubc30 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uacf5\uacf5 \uc548\uc804\uacfc \uacbd\uc81c\uc801 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud30c\uc774\ud504 \ub9c9\ud798, \ubc30\uacbd \ub204\uc218\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc131\uacfc \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ub77c\ubca8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc6b4\uc601 \uc81c\uc57d\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc545\ud654\ub41c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc9d1\ub2e8 \uc774\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ub41c \ud30c\uc774\ud504 \ub9c9\ud798\uacfc \uac1c\ub150 \uc774\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ub41c \ubc30\uacbd \ub204\uc218\ub97c \uac10\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ube44\uc9c0\ub3c4 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, LSTM-VAE\uc640 \uc774\uc911 \ub4dc\ub9ac\ud504\ud2b8 \uac10\uc9c0 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \uc870\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uac10\uc9c0 \ubc0f \uc801\uc751\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c WDN\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc774 \uc774\uc0c1 \uac10\uc9c0 \ubc0f \ubc18\ubcf5 \ub4dc\ub9ac\ud504\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc801\uc751\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc744 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2a5\uac00\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub3d9\uc801 WDN \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ube44\uc9c0\ub3c4 \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8 \uac10\uc9c0\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc218\uc6d0 \ubd84\ubc30 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c(WDN)\ub294 \uacf5\uacf5\uc758 \ubcf5\uc9c0\uc640 \uacbd\uc81c\uc801 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\uba70, \ud30c\uc774\ud504 \ub9c9\ud798 \ubc0f \ubc30\uacbd \ub204\uc218\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uace0, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc131 \ubc0f \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ub77c\ubca8 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc6b4\uc601 \uc81c\uc57d\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \ub354 \uc2ec\uac01\ud574\uc9c4\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 WDN\uc758 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uacb0\ud568, \uc989 \uc9d1\ub2e8 \uc774\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ub41c \ud30c\uc774\ud504 \ub9c9\ud798\uacfc \uac1c\ub150 \uc774\ub3d9\uc73c\ub85c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ub41c \ubc30\uacbd \ub204\uc218\ub97c \uac10\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ube44\uc9c0\ub3c4 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 LSTM-VAE\uc640 \uc774\uc911 \ub4dc\ub9ac\ud504\ud2b8 \uac10\uc9c0 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \uc870\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uac10\uc9c0 \ubc0f \uc801\uc751\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uacbd\ub7c9\ud654\ub418\uace0 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc124\uacc4\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc2e4\uc2dc\uac04 \uc5e3\uc9c0 \uc218\uc900 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\ub2e4. \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c WDN\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc740 \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc774 \uc774\uc0c1 \uac10\uc9c0\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc744 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2a5\uac00\ud558\uace0 \ubc18\ubcf5 \ub4dc\ub9ac\ud504\ud2b8\uc5d0 \uc801\uc751\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uba70, \ub3d9\uc801 WDN \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ube44\uc9c0\ub3c4 \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8 \uac10\uc9c0\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

For example,\nthey appear as object boundaries in computer vision, isolines in meteorology,\nand the orbits of rotating machinery. In many cases when learning from contour\ndata, planar rotations of the input will result in correspondingly rotated\noutputs. It is therefore desirable that deep learning models be rotationally\nequivariant. In addition, contours are typically represented as an ordered\nsequence of edge points, where the choice of starting point is arbitrary. It is\ntherefore also desirable for deep learning methods to be equivariant under\ncyclic shifts. We present RotaTouille, a deep learning framework for learning\nfrom contour data that achieves both rotation and cyclic shift equivariance\nthrough complex-valued circular convolution. We further introduce and\ncharacterize equivariant non-linearities, coarsening layers, and global pooling\nlayers to obtain invariant representations for downstream tasks. Finally, we\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of RotaTouille through experiments in shape\nclassification, reconstruction, and contour regression.", "AI": {"tldr": "RotaTouille\ub294 \ud68c\uc804\uacfc \uc21c\ud658 \uc774\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ubd88\ubcc0\uc131\uc744 \uac16\ucd98 \uc2ec\uce35 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc724\uacfd\uc120 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud559\uc2b5\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub41c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc724\uacfd\uc120 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\uc791\uc810 \uc120\ud0dd\uc774 \uc784\uc758\uc801\uc774\uba70, \ud68c\uc804\uacfc \uc21c\ud658 \uc774\ub3d9 \ubd88\ubcc0\uc131\uc744 \uac16\ucd98 \uc2ec\uce35 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubcf5\uc18c\uc218 \uac12\uc758 \uc21c\ud658 \ud569\uc131\uacf1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud68c\uc804\uacfc \uc21c\ud658 \uc774\ub3d9 \ubd88\ubcc0\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 RotaTouille \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ud615\uc0c1 \ubd84\ub958, \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131, \uc724\uacfd\uc120 \ud68c\uadc0 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 RotaTouille\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc785\uc99d\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "RotaTouille\ub294 \uc724\uacfd\uc120 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4 \ud601\uc2e0\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba70, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub2e4\uc6b4\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9bc \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd88\ubcc0 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uc5bb\ub294\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc724\uacfd\uc120 \ub610\ub294 \ud3d0\uc1c4 \ud3c9\uba74 \uace1\uc120\uc740 \ub9ce\uc740 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \uc608\ub97c \ub4e4\uc5b4, \ucef4\ud4e8\ud130 \ube44\uc804\uc5d0\uc11c \uac1d\uccb4 \uacbd\uacc4\ub85c, \uae30\uc0c1\ud559\uc5d0\uc11c \ub4f1\uace0\uc120\uc73c\ub85c, \ud68c\uc804 \uae30\uacc4\uc758 \uada4\ub3c4\ub85c \ub4f1\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc724\uacfd\uc120 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \ud559\uc2b5\ud560 \ub54c, \uc785\ub825\uc758 \ud3c9\uba74 \ud68c\uc804\uc740 \uc0c1\uc751\ud558\ub294 \ud68c\uc804 \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uc2ec\uce35 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud68c\uc804 \ubd88\ubcc0\uc131\uc744 \uac16\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ubc14\ub78c\uc9c1\ud558\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc724\uacfd\uc120\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5e3\uc9c0 \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8\uc758 \uc815\ub82c\ub41c \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4\ub85c \ud45c\ud604\ub418\uba70, \uc2dc\uc791\uc810 \uc120\ud0dd\uc740 \uc784\uc758\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uc2ec\uce35 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \uc21c\ud658 \uc774\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ubd88\ubcc0\uc131\uc744 \uac16\ub294 \uac83\ub3c4 \ubc14\ub78c\uc9c1\ud558\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 RotaTouille\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ubcf5\uc18c\uc218 \uac12\uc758 \uc21c\ud658 \ud569\uc131\uacf1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud68c\uc804\uacfc \uc21c\ud658 \uc774\ub3d9 \ubd88\ubcc0\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc724\uacfd\uc120 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2ec\uce35 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub610\ud55c \ubd88\ubcc0 \ud45c\ud604\uc744 \uc5bb\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubd88\ubcc0 \ube44\uc120\ud615\uc131, \uc138\ubd84\ud654 \uacc4\uce35 \ubc0f \uc804\uc5ed \ud480\ub9c1 \uacc4\uce35\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c, \ud615\uc0c1 \ubd84\ub958, \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131 \ubc0f \uc724\uacfd\uc120 \ud68c\uadc0 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 RotaTouille\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc785\uc99d\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that these AI/ML\nsystems do not make any discriminatory decisions for any specific groups or\npopulations. In that vein, different bias detection and mitigation open-source\nsoftware libraries (aka API libraries) are being developed and used. In this\npaper, we conduct a qualitative study to understand in what scenarios these\nopen-source fairness APIs are used in the wild, how they are used, and what\nchallenges the developers of these APIs face while developing and adopting\nthese libraries. We have analyzed 204 GitHub repositories (from a list of 1885\ncandidate repositories) which used 13 APIs that are developed to address bias\nin ML software. We found that these APIs are used for two primary purposes\n(i.e., learning and solving real-world problems), targeting 17 unique\nuse-cases. Our study suggests that developers are not well-versed in bias\ndetection and mitigation; they face lots of troubleshooting issues, and\nfrequently ask for opinions and resources.

Existing machine learning (ML) surrogates often\nrequire large datasets to generalize across various topologies or to accurately\nmodel skewed and multi-modal performance metrics. In this work, a lightweight,\ndata-efficient, and topology-aware graph neural network (GNN) model is proposed\nfor predicting key performance metrics of multiple topologies of active RF\ncircuits such as low noise amplifiers (LNAs), mixers, voltage-controlled\noscillators (VCOs), and PAs. To capture transistor-level symmetry and preserve\nfine-grained connectivity details, circuits are modeled at the device-terminal\nlevel, enabling scalable message passing while reducing data requirements.\nMasked autoregressive flow (MAF) output heads are incorporated to improve\nrobustness in modeling complex target distributions. Experiments on datasets\ndemonstrate high prediction accuracy, with symmetric mean absolute percentage\nerror (sMAPE) and mean relative error (MRE) averaging 2.40% and 2.91%,\nrespectively. Owing to the pin-level conversion of circuit to graph and ML\narchitecture robust to modeling complex densities of RF metrics, the MRE is\nimproved by 3.14x while using 2.24x fewer training samples compared to prior\nwork, demonstrating the method's effectiveness for rapid and accurate RF\ncircuit design automation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 RF \ud68c\ub85c\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uacbd\ub7c9\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801 \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud604\ub300 \ubb34\uc120 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2a5\ub3d9 RF \ud68c\ub85c\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud2b8\ub79c\uc9c0\uc2a4\ud130 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ub300\uce6d\uc131\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uace0 \uc138\ubd80 \uc5f0\uacb0\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc874\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc7a5\uce58 \ub2e8\ub9d0 \uc218\uc900\uc5d0\uc11c \ud68c\ub85c\ub97c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uace0, \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ubaa9\ud45c \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud06c \uc790\uc728 \ud68c\uadc0 \ud750\ub984(MAF) \ucd9c\ub825 \ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \ub192\uc740 \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc600\uace0, sMAPE\uc640 MRE\ub294 \uac01\uac01 2.40%\uc640 2.91%\ub97c \uae30\ub85d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 RF \ud68c\ub85c \uc124\uacc4 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc2e0\uc18d\ud558\uace0 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub2a5\ub3d9 \ubb34\uc120 \uc8fc\ud30c\uc218(RF) \ud68c\ub85c\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \uc608\uce21\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ud604\ub300 \ubb34\uc120 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uace0\ub3c4\ub85c \ube44\uc120\ud615\uc801\uc774\uba70 \ub808\uc774\uc544\uc6c3\uc5d0 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \ub3d9\uc791\uacfc \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ub3c4\uad6c\uc758 \ub192\uc740 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uba38\uc2e0 \ub7ec\ub2dd(ML) \ub300\uccb4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud1a0\ud3f4\ub85c\uc9c0\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uae30\uc6b8\uc5b4\uc9c4 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub4dc \uc131\ub2a5 \uc9c0\ud45c\ub97c \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc885\uc885 \ub300\ub7c9\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\ub97c \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud55c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc800\uc7a1\uc74c \uc99d\ud3ed\uae30(LNA), \ubbf9\uc11c, \uc804\uc555 \uc81c\uc5b4 \uc624\uc2e4\ub808\uc774\ud130(VCO), PA\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ub2a5\ub3d9 RF \ud68c\ub85c\uc758 \uc5ec\ub7ec \ud1a0\ud3f4\ub85c\uc9c0\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc9c0\ud45c\ub97c \uc608\uce21\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uacbd\ub7c9\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud1a0\ud3f4\ub85c\uc9c0 \uc778\uc2dd \uadf8\ub798\ud504 \uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd(GNN) \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud2b8\ub79c\uc9c0\uc2a4\ud130 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ub300\uce6d\uc131\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uace0 \uc138\ubd80 \uc5f0\uacb0\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc874\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud68c\ub85c\ub294 \uc7a5\uce58 \ub2e8\ub9d0 \uc218\uc900\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ub418\uc5b4 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uba74\uc11c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uba54\uc2dc\uc9c0 \uc804\ub2ec\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\ub2e4. \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ubaa9\ud45c \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud06c \uc790\uc728 \ud68c\uadc0 \ud750\ub984(MAF) \ucd9c\ub825 \ud5e4\ub4dc\ub97c \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc138\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 2.40%\uc640 2.91%\uc758 \ub300\uce6d \ud3c9\uade0 \uc808\ub300 \ubc31\ubd84\uc728 \uc624\ucc28(sMAPE)\uc640 \ud3c9\uade0 \uc0c1\ub300 \uc624\ucc28(MRE)\ub97c \uac01\uac01 \uae30\ub85d\ud558\uba70 \ub192\uc740 \uc608\uce21 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \ud68c\ub85c\ub97c \uadf8\ub798\ud504\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud558\ub294 \ud540 \ub808\ubca8 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uacfc RF \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ubc00\ub3c4\ub97c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uac15\ub825\ud55c ML \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98 \ub355\ubd84\uc5d0, \uc774\uc804 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 MRE\ub294 3.14\ubc30 \uac1c\uc120\ub418\uc5c8\uace0 2.24\ubc30 \uc801\uc740 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4."}}

Most existing methods primarily focus on training policies\nthat maximize cumulative returns from a given dataset. However, many real-world\napplications require precise control over policy performance levels, rather\nthan simply pursuing the best possible return. Reinforcement learning via\nsupervised learning (RvS) frames offline RL as a sequence modeling task,\nenabling the extraction of diverse policies by conditioning on different\ndesired returns. Yet, existing RvS-based transformers, such as Decision\nTransformer (DT), struggle to reliably align the actual achieved returns with\nspecified target returns, especially when interpolating within underrepresented\nreturns or extrapolating beyond the dataset. To address this limitation, we\npropose Doctor, a novel approach that Double Checks the Transformer with target\nalignment for Offline RL. Doctor achieves superior target alignment both within\nand beyond the dataset, while enabling accurate and flexible control over\npolicy performance. Notably, on the dynamic treatment regime benchmark,\nEpiCare, our approach effectively modulates treatment policy aggressiveness,\nbalancing therapeutic returns against adverse event risk.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ucc45 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc218\uc900\uc744 \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \uc81c\uc5b4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc778 Doctor\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uc218\uc775\uc744 \ucd94\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc911\uc810\uc744 \ub450\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc2e4\uc81c \uc751\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc815\ucc45 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc218\uc900\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc815\ubc00\ud55c \uc81c\uc5b4\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "Doctor\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubaa9\ud45c \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc5ec \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 RL\uc744 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "Doctor\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b \ub0b4\uc678\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \ubaa9\ud45c \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uc815\ucc45 \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc815\ud655\ud558\uace0 \uc720\uc5f0\ud55c \uc81c\uc5b4\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "EpiCare \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uce58\ub8cc \uc815\ucc45\uc758 \uacf5\uaca9\uc131\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc808\ud558\uba70, \uce58\ub8cc \uc218\uc775\uacfc \ubd80\uc791\uc6a9 \uc704\ud5d8 \uac04\uc758 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \ub9de\ucd98\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5(RL)\uc740 \ub85c\ubd07 \uc81c\uc5b4, \uc790\uc728\uc8fc\ud589 \ubc0f \uc758\ub8cc \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc8fc\uc5b4\uc9c4 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \ub204\uc801 \uc218\uc775\uc744 \uadf9\ub300\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc815\ucc45 \uad50\uc721\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc751\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ucd5c\uc0c1\uc758 \uc218\uc775\uc744 \ucd94\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \ub300\uc2e0 \uc815\ucc45 \uc131\ub2a5 \uc218\uc900\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc815\ubc00\ud55c \uc81c\uc5b4\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \uc9c0\ub3c4 \ud559\uc2b5(RvS)\uc740 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 RL\uc744 \uc2dc\ud000\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \uc791\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \ud615\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ucd94\ucd9c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 Decision Transformer(DT)\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uae30\uc874 RvS \uae30\ubc18 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c \uc218\uc775\uacfc \uc9c0\uc815\ub41c \ubaa9\ud45c \uc218\uc775\uc744 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\ub82c\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ud2b9\ud788 \ub300\ud45c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uc218\uc775 \ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf4\uac04\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc744 \ucd08\uacfc\ud558\uc5ec \uc678\uc0bd\ud560 \ub54c \uadf8\ub7ec\ud558\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc81c\ud55c\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 RL\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ubaa9\ud45c \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30\ub97c \uc774\uc911 \ud655\uc778\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc778 Doctor\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.

We evaluate\nsuccess rate and common errors across LLMs and game popularity. Our approach\nproves viable, with the best performing model, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, yielding\n55.6\\% of games without any errors.

In domains where new data can be simulated cheaply,\nthese systems uncover sequential decision-making policies that far exceed the\nability of any human. Society faces many problems whose solutions require this\nskill, but they are often in domains where new data cannot be cheaply\nsimulated. In such scenarios, we can learn simulators from existing data, but\nthese will only ever be approximately correct, and can be pathologically\nincorrect when queried outside of their training distribution. As a result, a\nmisalignment between the environments in which we train our agents and the\nreal-world in which we wish to deploy our agents is inevitable. Dealing with\nthis misalignment is the primary concern of zero-shot reinforcement learning, a\nproblem setting where the agent must generalise to a new task or domain with\nzero practice shots. Whilst impressive progress has been made on methods that\nperform zero-shot RL in idealised settings, new work is needed if these results\nare to be replicated in real-world settings. In this thesis, we argue that\ndoing so requires us to navigate (at least) three constraints. First, the data\nquality constraint: real-world datasets are small and homogeneous. Second, the\nobservability constraint: states, dynamics and rewards in the real-world are\noften only partially observed. And third, the data availability constraint: a\npriori access to data cannot always be assumed. This work proposes a suite of\nmethods that perform zero-shot RL subject to these constraints. In a series of\nempirical studies we expose the failings of existing methods, and justify our\ntechniques for remedying them. We believe these designs take us a step closer\nto RL methods that can be deployed to solve real-world problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc2e4\uc81c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758

As a result,\nexperimental resources are inefficiently allocated, leading to suboptimal\ndesigns. To address this challenge, we introduce NOSTRA (Noisy and Sparse Data\nTrust Region-based Optimization Algorithm), a novel sampling framework that\nintegrates prior knowledge of experimental uncertainty to construct more\naccurate surrogate models while employing trust regions to focus sampling on\npromising areas of the design space. By strategically leveraging prior\ninformation and refining search regions, NOSTRA accelerates convergence to the\nPareto frontier, enhances data efficiency, and improves solution quality.\nThrough two test functions with varying levels of experimental uncertainty, we\ndemonstrate that NOSTRA outperforms existing methods in handling noisy, sparse,\nand scarce data. Specifically, we illustrate that, NOSTRA effectively\nprioritizes regions where samples enhance the accuracy of the identified Pareto\nfrontier, offering a resource-efficient algorithm that is practical in\nscenarios with limited experimental budgets while ensuring efficient\nperformance.", "AI": {"tldr": "NOSTRA\ub294 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ub300\ub9ac \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uace0, \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uc744 \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \ub514\uc790\uc778 \uacf5\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \uc9d1\uc911\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uc815\ub7c9\uc801 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uac00 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uacbd\uc6b0\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "MOBO\ub294 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \uc785\ub825\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ucd9c\ub825\uc744 \uc5bb\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \ud76c\uc18c\ud55c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc73c\ub85c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \ubc0f \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "NOSTRA\ub294 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0ac\uc804 \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ub354 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ub300\ub9ac \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uace0, \uc2e0\ub8b0 \uc601\uc5ed\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud574 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1\uc744 \uc720\ub9dd\ud55c \ub514\uc790\uc778 \uacf5\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \uc9d1\uc911\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "NOSTRA\ub294 \ub450 \uac1c\uc758 \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud568\uc218\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf1c \ub178\uc774\uc988\uac00 \ub9ce\uace0 \ud76c\uc18c\ud558\uba70 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ucc98\ub9ac\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "NOSTRA\ub294 \uc790\uc6d0\uc774 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uba70, \uc0d8\ud50c\uc774 \ubc1c\uacac\ub41c \ud30c\ub808\ud1a0 \uacbd\uacc4\uc758 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \uac1c\uc120\ud558\ub294 \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc5d0 \uc6b0\uc120\uc21c\uc704\ub97c \ub450\ub294 \ub9ac\uc18c\uc2a4 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa9\uc801 \ubca0\uc774\uc9c0\uc548 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654(MOBO)\ub294 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc758 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubc1b\ub294 \ud76c\uc18c\ud558\uace0 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub4e4\uc740 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \ubc0f \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uba70 \uae30\uc874 MOBO \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc\ub294 \ud638\ud658\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uc790\uc6d0\uc774 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud560\ub2f9\ub418\uc5b4 \ucd5c\uc801\uc774 \uc544\ub2cc \uc124\uacc4\uac00 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc9d1\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub178\uc774\uc988\uc640 \ud76c\uc18c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc2e0\ub8b0 \uad6c\uc5ed \uae30\ubc18 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998(NOSTRA)\uc744 \uc18c\uac1c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

This\nleaves many unanswered questions about the roles of different factors in the\nsynthetic data pipeline, such as the impact of filtering low-quality problems.\nTo address this gap, we introduce FLAMES, a Framework for LLM Assessment of\nMath rEasoning Data Synthesis, and perform a systematic study of 10 existing\ndata synthesis strategies and multiple other factors impacting the performance\nof synthetic math reasoning data. Our FLAMES experiments provide several\nvaluable insights about the optimal balance of difficulty and diversity of\nsynthetic data. First, data agents designed to increase problem complexity lead\nto best improvements on most math metrics. Second, with a fixed data generation\nbudget, keeping higher problem coverage is more important than keeping only\nproblems with reliable solutions. Third, GSM8K- and MATH-based synthetic data\ncan lead to improvements on competition-level benchmarks, showcasing\neasy-to-hard generalization. Leveraging insights from our FLAMES experiments,\nwe design two novel data synthesis strategies for improving out-of-domain\ngeneralization and robustness. Further, we develop the FLAMES dataset, an\neffective blend of our novel and existing data synthesis strategies,\noutperforming public datasets on OlympiadBench (+15.7), CollegeMath (+4.5),\nGSMPlus (+6.5), and MATH (+3.1).

To this end, we propose\na novel taxonomy of harms for agentic systems and a novel benchmark, BAD-ACTS,\nfor studying the security of agentic systems with respect to a wide range of\nharmful actions. BAD-ACTS consists of 4 implementations of agentic systems in\ndistinct application environments, as well as a dataset of 188 high-quality\nexamples of harmful actions. This enables a comprehensive study of the\nrobustness of agentic systems across a wide range of categories of harmful\nbehaviors, available tools, and inter-agent communication structures. Using\nthis benchmark, we analyze the robustness of agentic systems against an\nattacker that controls one of the agents in the system and aims to manipulate\nother agents to execute a harmful target action. Our results show that the\nattack has a high success rate, demonstrating that even a single adversarial\nagent within the system can have a significant impact on the security. This\nattack remains effective even when agents use a simple prompting-based defense\nstrategy. However, we additionally propose a more effective defense based on\nmessage monitoring.

While diffusion models equipped\nwith equivariant neural networks have made progress in capturing molecular\ngeometries, they often struggle to produce equilibrium structures that adhere\nto physical principles such as force field consistency. To bridge this gap, we\npropose Reinforcement Learning with Physical Feedback (RLPF), a novel framework\nthat extends Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization to 3D molecular\ngeneration. RLPF formulates the task as a Markov decision process and applies\nproximal policy optimization to fine-tune equivariant diffusion models.\nCrucially, RLPF introduces reward functions derived from force-field\nevaluations, providing direct physical feedback to guide the generation toward\nenergetically stable and physically meaningful structures. Experiments on the\nQM9 and GEOM-drug datasets demonstrate that RLPF significantly improves\nmolecular stability compared to existing methods. These results highlight the\nvalue of incorporating physics-based feedback into generative modeling.

Using an out-of-distribution (OOD) variant of the 24-point card game\nand new spectrum-based diagnostics, we revisit how these two stages reshape\nmodel representation and OOD performance. Our key findings are- (1) RL-FT can\nrestore much of the OOD performance loss from SFT (e.g., Llama-11B 8.97% to\n15.38%, Qwen-7B 17.09% to 19.66%). But when SFT induces severe overfitting and\na clear distribution shift, RL-FT cannot fully recover OOD performance. (2)\nDirection shifts of singular vectors matter more than singular value\nmagnitudes. These shifts concentrate on directions linked to the largest and\nsmallest singular values, leaving the bulk spectrum intact. (3) Low-rank and\nshallow recovery is effective: restoring singular vector directions for the top\n20% of values or first 25% of layers recovers 70-80% of OOD performance.

These systems enable residents to report issues, e.g., noise\ncomplaints, missed garbage collection, and potholes, via phone calls, mobile\napplications, or webpages. However, residents are often given limited\ninformation about when their service requests will be addressed, which can\nreduce transparency, lower resident satisfaction, and increase the number of\nfollow-up inquiries. Predicting the service time for municipal service requests\nis challenging due to several complex factors: dynamic spatial-temporal\ncorrelations, underlying interactions among heterogeneous service request\ntypes, and high variation in service duration even within the same request\ncategory. In this work, we propose MuST2-Learn: a Multi-view\nSpatial-Temporal-Type Learning framework designed to address the aforementioned\nchallenges by jointly modeling spatial, temporal, and service type dimensions.\nIn detail, it incorporates an inter-type encoder to capture relationships among\nheterogeneous service request types and an intra-type variation encoder to\nmodel service time variation within homogeneous types. In addition, a\nspatiotemporal encoder is integrated to capture spatial and temporal\ncorrelations in each request type. The proposed framework is evaluated with\nextensive experiments using two real-world datasets. The results show that\nMuST2-Learn reduces mean absolute error by at least 32.5%, which outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc2dc\ub0b4 311

Herbert"], "title": "Explainable AI in Deep Learning-Based Prediction of Solar Storms", "comment": "6 pages, 8 figures", "summary": "A deep learning model is often considered a black-box model, as its internal\nworkings tend to be opaque to the user. Because of the lack of transparency, it\nis challenging to understand the reasoning behind the model's predictions.\nHere, we present an approach to making a deep learning-based solar storm\nprediction model interpretable, where solar storms include solar flares and\ncoronal mass ejections (CMEs). This deep learning model, built based on a long\nshort-term memory (LSTM) network with an attention mechanism, aims to predict\nwhether an active region (AR) on the Sun's surface that produces a flare within\n24 hours will also produce a CME associated with the flare. The crux of our\napproach is to model data samples in an AR as time series and use the LSTM\nnetwork to capture the temporal dynamics of the data samples. To make the\nmodel's predictions accountable and reliable, we leverage post hoc\nmodel-agnostic techniques, which help elucidate the factors contributing to the\npredicted output for an input sequence and provide insights into the model's\nbehavior across multiple sequences within an AR.

To address these challenges, we introduce Practical\nSemi-Supervised Federated Learning (PSSFL), where edge devices hold only\nunlabeled, low-resolution data, while the server has limited labeled,\nhigh-resolution data. In this setting, we propose the Federated Mixture of\nExperts (FedMox), a novel framework that enhances FM adaptation in FL. FedMox\ntackles computational and resolution mismatch challenges via a sparse\nMixture-of-Experts architecture, employing a spatial router to align features\nacross resolutions and a Soft-Mixture strategy to stabilize semi-supervised\nlearning.

While fine-tuning adult ASR\nmodels on child speech is common, comparisons with flat-start training remain\nunderexplored. We compare flat-start training across multiple datasets, SSL\nrepresentations (WavLM, XEUS), and decoder architectures. Our results show that\nSSL representations are biased toward adult speech, with flat-start training on\nchild speech mitigating these biases. We also analyze model scaling, finding\nconsistent improvements up to 1B parameters, beyond which performance plateaus.\nAdditionally, age-related ASR and speaker verification analysis highlights the\nlimitations of proprietary models like Whisper, emphasizing the need for\nopen-data models for reliable child speech research.
