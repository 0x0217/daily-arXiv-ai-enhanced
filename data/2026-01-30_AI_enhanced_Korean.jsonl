The interactions within these systems often lead to extreme events whose origins remain obscured by the black box of emergence. Interpreting these events is critical for system safety. This paper proposes the first framework for explaining emergent extreme events in multi-agent systems, aiming to answer three fundamental questions: When does the event originate? Who drives it? And what behaviors contribute to it? Specifically, we adapt the Shapley value to faithfully attribute the occurrence of extreme events to each action taken by agents at different time steps, i.e., assigning an attribution score to the action to measure its influence on the event. We then aggregate the attribution scores along the dimensions of time, agent, and behavior to quantify the risk contribution of each dimension. Finally, we design a set of metrics based on these contribution scores to characterize the features of extreme events. Experiments across diverse multi-agent system scenarios (economic, financial, and social) demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework and provide general insights into the emergence of extreme phenomena.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uadf9\ub2e8\uc801 \uc0ac\uac74\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548.", "motivation": "\uadf9\ub2e8\uc801 \uc0ac\uac74\uc758 \uae30\uc6d0\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.", "method": "Shapley \uac00\uce58\ub97c \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac01 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud589\ub3d9\uc774 \uadf9\ub2e8\uc801 \uc0ac\uac74 \ubc1c\uc0dd\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud558\ub294 \uc815\ub3c4\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud588\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uadf9\ub2e8\uc801 \ud604\uc0c1\uc758 \ubc1c\uc0dd\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc778\uac04 \uc720\uc0ac \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ub3c4\uad6c\ub85c \ub5a0\uc62c\ub790\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ub0b4\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uadf8 \uae30\uc6d0\uc774 \uc911\ucca9\ub41c \ube14\ub799\ubc15\uc2a4\uc758 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubc1b\ub294 \uadf9\ub2e8\uc801 \uc0ac\uac74\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc9c4\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc0ac\uac74\uc744 \ud574\uc11d\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uadf9\ub2e8\uc801 \uc0ac\uac74\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uccab \ubc88\uc9f8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uae30\ubcf8 \uc9c8\ubb38\uc5d0 \ub2f5\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud55c\ub2e4: \uc0ac\uac74\uc740 \uc5b8\uc81c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294\uac00? \ub204\uac00 \uadf8\uac83\uc744 \uc8fc\ub3c4\ud558\ub294\uac00? \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uc5b4\ub5a4 \ud589\ub3d9\uc774 \uadf8\uac83\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud558\ub294\uac00? \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc2dc\uac04\uc758 \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ucde8\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9\uc774 \uadf9\ub2e8\uc801 \uc0ac\uac74\uc758 \ubc1c\uc0dd\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c \uae30\uc5ec\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc815\uc758\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 Shapley \uac12\uc744 \uc870\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \uac01 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uae30\uc5ec \uc810\uc218\ub97c \ud560\ub2f9\ud558\uace0 \uc0ac\uac74\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uce21\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7f0 \ub2e4\uc74c, \uc2dc\uac04, \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubc0f \ud589\ub3d9 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uae30\uc5ec \uc810\uc218\ub97c \uc9d1\uacc4\ud558\uc5ec \uac01 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc758 \uc704\ud5d8 \uae30\uc5ec\ub3c4\ub97c \uc815\ub7c9\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uae30\uc5ec \uc810\uc218\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uadf9\ub2e8\uc801 \uc0ac\uac74\uc758 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \ubb18\uc0ac\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc77c\ub828\uc758 \uce21\uc815 \uc9c0\ud45c\ub97c \uc124\uacc4\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624(\uacbd\uc81c, \uae08\uc735 \ubc0f \uc0ac\ud68c)\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud558\uace0 \uadf9\ub2e8\uc801 \ud604\uc0c1\uc758 \ubc1c\uc0dd\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

We therefore aim to develop Insight Agents (IA), a conversational multi-agent Data Insight system, to provide E-commerce sellers with personalized data and business insights through automated information retrieval. Our hypothesis is that IA will serve as a force multiplier for sellers, thereby driving incremental seller adoption by reducing the effort required and increase speed at which sellers make good business decisions. In this paper, we introduce this novel LLM-backed end-to-end agentic system built on a plan-and-execute paradigm and designed for comprehensive coverage, high accuracy, and low latency. It features a hierarchical multi-agent structure, consisting of manager agent and two worker agents: data presentation and insight generation, for efficient information retrieval and problem-solving. We design a simple yet effective ML solution for manager agent that combines Out-of-Domain (OOD) detection using a lightweight encoder-decoder model and agent routing through a BERT-based classifier, optimizing both accuracy and latency. Within the two worker agents, a strategic planning is designed for API-based data model that breaks down queries into granular components to generate more accurate responses, and domain knowledge is dynamically injected to to enhance the insight generator.

Image-level mixed sample data augmentations, such as CutMix and MixUp, are frequently used for training transformers, yet these techniques perturb patient-specific attributes, such as medical comorbidity and clinical factors, since they only account for images and labels. To address this limitation, we propose a hierarchical sampling strategy, Oculomix, for mixed sample augmentations. Our method is based on two clinical priors. First (exam level), images acquired from the same patient at the same time point share the same attributes. Second (patient level), images acquired from the same patient at different time points have a soft temporal trend, as morbidity generally increases over time. Guided by these priors, our method constrains the mixing space to the patient and exam levels to better preserve patient-specific characteristics and leverages their hierarchical relationships. The proposed method is validated using ViT models on a five-year prediction of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in a large ethnically diverse population (Alzeye). We show that Oculomix consistently outperforms image-level CutMix and MixUp by up to 3% in AUROC, demonstrating the necessity and value of the proposed method in oculomics.", "AI": {"tldr":

Recent advances in generative AI enable deepfake and semantic manipulation attacks that can compromise agent perception, reasoning, and interaction with the physical environment, while emerging protocols such as the Model Context Protocol (MCP) further expand the attack surface through dynamic tool use and cross-domain context sharing. This survey provides a comprehensive review of security threats targeting AI agents in CPS, with a particular focus on environmental interactions, deepfake-driven attacks, and MCP-mediated vulnerabilities. We organize the literature using the SENTINEL framework, a lifecycle-aware methodology that integrates threat characterization, feasibility analysis under CPS constraints, defense selection, and continuous validation. Through an end-to-end case study grounded in a real-world smart grid deployment, we quantitatively illustrate how timing, noise, and false-positive costs constrain deployable defenses, and why detection mechanisms alone are insufficient as decision authorities in safety-critical CPS. The survey highlights the role of provenance- and physics-grounded trust mechanisms and defense-in-depth architectures, and outlines open challenges toward trustworthy AI-enabled CPS.", "AI": {"tldr": "CPS\uc5d0\uc11c AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc704\ud611\uacfc \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \uc885\ud569\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\ud1a0\ud558\uace0, \ubc29\uc5b4 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uc124\uba85\ud558\ub294 \uc5f0\uad6c.", "motivation": "AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ud1b5\ud569\uc774 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ubc0f \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc704\ud611 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ub118\uc5b4\uc11c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud558\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38.", "method": "SENTINEL \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubb38\ud5cc\uc744 \uc870\uc9c1\ud558\uace0, \uc2e4\uc81c \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uadf8\ub9ac\ub4dc \ubc30\uce58\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uc0ac\ub840 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc758 \uc81c\uc57d\uc744 \uc815\ub7c9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc124\uba85.", "result": "\ubc29\uc5b4 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774 \uc2e4\ud589\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc81c\ud55c\uacfc, \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \uc548\uc804-critical CPS\uc5d0\uc11c \ucda9\ubd84\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 AI \uae30\ubc18 CPS\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc6d0\ucc9c \ubc0f \ubb3c\ub9ac\ud559\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uc2e0\ub8b0 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uacfc \uc2ec\uce35 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uace0, \ud5a5\ud6c4 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud588\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84-\ubb3c\ub9ac \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(CPS)\uc5d0 \ud1b5\ud569\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \ub610\ub294 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc704\ud611 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ub118\uc5b4\uc11c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc704\ud5d8\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc0dd\uc131\uc801 AI\uc758 \ucd5c\uadfc \ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc778\uc2dd, \ucd94\ub860 \ubc0f \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \ud658\uacbd\uacfc\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc744 \uce68\ud574\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub525\ud398\uc774\ud06c \ubc0f \uc758\ubbf8 \uc870\uc791 \uacf5\uaca9\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uba70, \ubaa8\ub378 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c(MCP)\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub85c\ud1a0\ucf5c\uc740 \ub3d9\uc801 \ub3c4\uad6c \uc0ac\uc6a9 \ubc0f \uad50\ucc28 \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \ucee8\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uacf5\uc720\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uacf5\uaca9 \ud45c\uba74\uc744 \ub354\uc6b1 \ud655\uc7a5\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc11c\ubca0\uc774\ub294 \ud658\uacbd \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9, \ub525\ud398\uc774\ud06c \uae30\ubc18 \uacf5\uaca9 \ubc0f MCP \ub9e4\uac1c \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc5d0 \ud2b9\ud788 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucdb0 CPS\uc5d0\uc11c AI \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \uaca8\ub0e5\ud55c \ubcf4\uc548 \uc704\ud611\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \uac80\ud1a0\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc704\ud611 \ud2b9\uc131\ud654, CPS \uc81c\uc57d \ud558\uc758 \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \ubd84\uc11d, \ubc29\uc5b4 \uc120\ud0dd \ubc0f \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud558\ub294 \ub77c\uc774\ud504\uc0ac\uc774\ud074 \uc778\uc2dd \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc778 SENTINEL \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubb38\ud5cc\uc744 \uc870\uc9c1\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc2e4\uc81c \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \uadf8\ub9ac\ub4dc \ubc30\uce58\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \ub05d\uc5d0\uc11c \ub05d\uae4c\uc9c0\uc758 \uc0ac\ub840 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud0c0\uc774\ubc0d, \ub178\uc774\uc988 \ubc0f \uc624\ud0d0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ubc30\ud3ec \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubc29\uc5b4\ub97c \uc81c\uc57d\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uacfc, \ud0d0\uc9c0 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \uc548\uc804-critical CPS\uc5d0\uc11c \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \uad8c\ud55c\uc73c\ub85c \ucda9\ubd84\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uc774\uc720\ub97c \uc815\ub7c9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc124\uba85\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc11c\ubca0\uc774\ub294 \uc6d0\ucc9c \ubc0f \ubb3c\ub9ac\ud559\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uc2e0\ub8b0 \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uacfc \uc2ec\uce35 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\uace0, \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 AI \uae30\ubc18 CPS\ub97c \ud5a5\ud55c \uc5f4\ub9b0 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

We introduce a framework that enables such counterfactual reasoning in agentic LLM-driven control scenarios, while providing formal reliability guarantees. Our approach models the closed-loop interaction between a user, an LLM-based agent, and an environment as a structural causal model (SCM), and leverages test-time scaling to generate multiple candidate counterfactual outcomes via probabilistic abduction. Through an offline calibration phase, the proposed conformal counterfactual generation (CCG) yields sets of counterfactual outcomes that are guaranteed to contain the true counterfactual outcome with high probability.

Existing caching methods reduce redundant computation but typically rely on instantaneous velocity information (e.g., feature caching), which often leads to severe trajectory deviations and error accumulation under high acceleration ratios. MeanCache introduces an average-velocity perspective: by leveraging cached Jacobian--vector products (JVP) to construct interval average velocities from instantaneous velocities, it effectively mitigates local error accumulation. To further improve cache timing and JVP reuse stability, we develop a trajectory-stability scheduling strategy as a practical tool, employing a Peak-Suppressed Shortest Path under budget constraints to determine the schedule. Experiments on FLUX.1, Qwen-Image, and HunyuanVideo demonstrate that MeanCache achieves 4.12X and 4.56X and 3.59X acceleration, respectively, while consistently outperforming state-of-the-art caching baselines in generation quality. We believe this simple yet effective approach provides a new perspective for Flow Matching inference and will inspire further exploration of stability-driven acceleration in commercial-scale generative models.", "AI": {"tldr": "MeanCache\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828\uc774 \ud544\uc694 \uc5c6\ub294 \uce90\uc2f1 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 Flow Matching \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uac83\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uace0\uc18d\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc624\ucc28 \ucd95\uc801 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0, \uae30\uc874 \uce90\uc26c \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 Flow Matching \ucd94\ub860\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uc21c\uac04 \uc18d\ub3c4 \uc815\ubcf4\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc77c\uc73c\ud0a8\ub2e4.", "method": "MeanCache\ub294 \ud3c9\uade0 \uc18d\ub3c4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc21c\uac04 \uc18d\ub3c4\uc5d0\uc11c \uac04\uaca9 \ud3c9\uade0 \uc18d\ub3c4\ub97c \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uce90\uc2dc\ub41c Jacobian-\ubca1\ud130 \uacf1(JVP)\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "FLUX.1, Qwen-Image, HunyuanVideo \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c MeanCache\uac00 \uac01\uac01 4.12X, 4.56X, 3.59X \uac00\uc18d\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "MeanCache\ub294 Flow Matching \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uad00\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uba70, \uc0c1\uc5c5\uc801 \uaddc\ubaa8\uc758 \uc0dd\uc131 \ubaa8\ub378\uc5d0\uc11c \uc548\uc815\uc131 \uae30\ubc18 \uac00\uc18d\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucd94\uac00\uc801\uc778 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\ud560 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 Flow Matching \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud6c8\ub828 \uc5c6\ub294 \uce90\uc2f1 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 MeanCache\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uce90\uc2f1 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc911\ubcf5 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc \ubcf4\ud1b5 \uc21c\uac04 \uc18d\ub3c4 \uc815\ubcf4(\uc608: \ud53c\ucc98 \uce90\uc2f1)\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \ub192\uc740 \uac00\uc18d \ube44\uc728\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \uacbd\ub85c \ud3b8\ucc28\uc640 \uc624\ub958 \ub204\uc801\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

To address these limitations, this paper presents multimodal multi agent ransomware analysis framework designed for ransomware classification. Proposed multimodal multiagent architecture combines information from static, dynamic and network sources. Each data type is handled by specialized agent that uses auto encoder based feature extraction. These representations are then integrated through a fusion agent. After that fused representation are used by transformer based classifier. It identifies the specific ransomware family. The agents interact through an interagent feedback mechanism that iteratively refines feature representations by suppressing low confidence information. The framework was evaluated on large scale datasets containing thousands of ransomware and benign samples. Multiple experiments were conducted on ransomware dataset. It outperforms single modality and nonadaptive fusion baseline achieving improvement of up to 0.936 in Macro-F1 for family classification and reducing calibration error. Over 100 epochs, the agentic feedback loop displays a stable monotonic convergence leading to over +0.75 absolute improvement in terms of agent quality and a final composite score of around 0.88 without fine tuning of the language models. Zeroday ransomware detection remains family dependent on polymorphism and modality disruptions. Confidence aware abstention enables reliable real world deployment by favoring conservativeand trustworthy decisions over forced classification. The findings indicate that proposed approach provides a practical andeffective path toward improving real world ransomware defense systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud234\uc744

However, traditional change detection methods based on remote sensing imagery have obvious limitations in high-level and intelligent analysis, and thus are difficult to meet the requirements of current urban planning and management. In face of the growing demand for complex multi-modal data analysis in urban park development monitoring, these methods often fail to provide flexible analysis capabilities for diverse application scenarios. This study proposes a multi-modal LLM agent framework, which aims to make full use of the semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLM to meet the challenges in urban park development monitoring. In this framework, a general horizontal and vertical data alignment mechanism is designed to ensure the consistency and effective tracking of multi-modal data. At the same time, a specific toolkit is constructed to alleviate the hallucination issues of LLM due to the lack of domain-specific knowledge. Compared to vanilla GPT-4o and other agents, our approach enables robust multi-modal information fusion and analysis, offering reliable and scalable solutions tailored to the diverse and evolving demands of urban park development monitoring.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub3c4\uc2dc \uacf5\uc6d0 \uac1c\ubc1c \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc2e0\uaddc \uacf5\uc6d0 \uac74\uc124\uc758 \uac1c\ubc1c \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\uc740 \ub3c4\uc2dc \uacc4\ud68d \ud6a8\uacfc \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc0f \uc790\uc6d0 \ubc30\ubd84 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uc5ec LLM\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc774\ud574 \ubc0f \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uace0, \uc218\ud3c9 \ubc0f \uc218\uc9c1 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc815\ub82c \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uc815\ubcf4 \uc735\ud569 \ubc0f \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \ub3c4\uc2dc \uacf5\uc6d0 \uac1c\ubc1c \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc694\uad6c\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucd98 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uace0 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc751\uc6a9 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc720\uc5f0\ud55c \ubd84\uc11d \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc5ec \ub3c4\uc2dc \uacf5\uc6d0 \uac1c\ubc1c \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\uc758 \ud604\uc7ac \uc694\uad6c\ub97c \ucda9\uc871\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub3c4\uc2dc\ud654\uc758 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ubd80\ubd84\uc73c\ub85c\uc11c, \uc0c8\ub85c \uac74\uc124\ub41c \uacf5\uc6d0\uc758 \uac1c\ubc1c \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\uc740 \ub3c4\uc2dc \uacc4\ud68d\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc790\uc6d0 \ubc30\ubd84\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud070 \uc758\ubbf8\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc6d0\uac70\ub9ac \uac10\uc9c0 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ubcc0\ud654 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uace0\uae09 \ubc0f \uc9c0\ub2a5\uc801 \ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0\uc11c \uba85\ud655\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uc9c0\ub2c8\uace0 \uc788\uc5b4 \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ub3c4\uc2dc \uacc4\ud68d \ubc0f \uad00\ub9ac \uc694\uad6c\ub97c \ucda9\uc871\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub835\ub2e4. \ub3c4\uc2dc \uacf5\uc6d0 \uac1c\ubc1c \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc218\uc694\uac00 \uc99d\uac00\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc751\uc6a9 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc720\uc5f0\ud55c \ubd84\uc11d \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub3c4\uc2dc \uacf5\uc6d0 \uac1c\ubc1c \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\uc758 \ub3c4\uc804\uc5d0 \ub300\uc751\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 LLM\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc774\ud574 \ubc0f \ucd94\ub860 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ucd5c\ub300\ud55c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uacfc \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ucd94\uc801\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uc218\ud3c9 \ubc0f \uc218\uc9c1 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc815\ub82c \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc774 \uc124\uacc4\ub41c\ub2e4. \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ud2b9\uc815 \ub3c4\uad6c \ud0a4\ud2b8\ub97c \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \ub3c4\uba54\uc778 \uc804\ubb38 \uc9c0\uc2dd \ubd80\uc871\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud55c LLM\uc758 \ud658\uac01 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc644\ud654\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc21c\uc218\ud55c GPT-4o \ubc0f \uae30\ud0c0 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc640 \ube44\uad50\ud560 \ub54c, \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc\ubc95\uc740 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \ubaa8\ub2ec \uc815\ubcf4 \uc735\ud569 \ubc0f \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc5ec \ub3c4\uc2dc \uacf5\uc6d0 \uac1c\ubc1c \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud558\uace0 \uc9c4\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uc694\uad6c\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucd98 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uace0 \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc194\ub8e8\uc158\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

However, existing approaches, such as MAGE, struggle in stochastic or noisy environments, limiting their applicability. In this work, we address these limitations by extending distributional reinforcement learning on continuous state-action spaces to model not only the distribution over scalar state-action value functions but also over their gradients. We refer to this approach as Distributional Sobolev Training. Inspired by Stochastic Value Gradients (SVG), our method utilizes a one-step world model of reward and transition distributions implemented via a conditional Variational Autoencoder (cVAE). The proposed framework is sample-based and employs Max-sliced Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MSMMD) to instantiate the distributional Bellman operator. We prove that the Sobolev-augmented Bellman operator is a contraction with a unique fixed point, and highlight a fundamental smoothness trade-off underlying contraction in gradient-aware RL. To validate our method, we first showcase its effectiveness on a simple stochastic reinforcement learning toy problem, then benchmark its performance on several MuJoCo environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubd84\ud3ec \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874\uc758 \uae30\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \ud655\ub960\uc801\uc774\uac70\ub098 \ub178\uc774\uc988\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc801\uc6a9\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\uac00 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc5f0\uc18d \uc0c1\ud0dc-\ud589\ub3d9 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubd84\ud3ec \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uc5ec \uc2a4\uce7c\ub77c \uc0c1\ud0dc-\ud589\ub3d9 \uac00\uce58 \ud568\uc218\uc758 \ubd84\ud3ec\ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uadf8 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 \ubd84\ud3ec Sobolev \ud6c8\ub828\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uccab\uc9f8\ub85c \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc7a5\ub09c\uac10 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uace0, \ub458\uc9f8\ub85c \uc5ec\ub7ec MuJoCo \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud0b9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "Sobolev \uc99d\uac15 Bellman \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc790\ub294 \uace0\uc720\ud55c \uace0\uc815\uc810\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \uc218\ucd95 \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc790\uc784\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud558\uace0, \uae30\uc6b8\uae30\uc5d0 \ubbfc\uac10\ud55c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc218\ucd95\uc758 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ub9e4\ub044\ub7ec\uc6c0 \uc808\ucda9\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8 \uc815\uaddc\ud654\ub41c \uac00\uce58 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc804\uc774 \uc5ed\ud559 \ubc0f \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubc18\ud658 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8\ub97c \ucd94\uc815\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc0d8\ud50c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 MAGE\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uae30\uc874 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ud655\ub960\uc801 \ub610\ub294 \ub178\uc774\uc988 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uc5b4 \uadf8 \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5f0\uc18d \uc0c1\ud0dc-\ud589\ub3d9 \uacf5\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd84\ud3ec \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc744 \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uc5ec \uc2a4\uce7c\ub77c \uc0c1\ud0dc-\ud589\ub3d9 \uac00\uce58 \ud568\uc218\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubd84\ud3ec\ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uadf8 \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ubd84\ud3ec Sobolev \ud6c8\ub828\uc774\ub77c\uace0 \ubd80\ub985\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uac00\uce58 \uadf8\ub798\ub514\uc5b8\ud2b8(SVG)\uc5d0\uc11c \uc601\uac10\uc744 \ubc1b\uc740 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc870\uac74\ubd80 \ubcc0\ubd84 \uc790\ub3d9 \uc778\ucf54\ub354(cVAE)\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uad6c\ud604\ub41c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubc0f \uc804\uc774 \ubd84\ud3ec\uc758 1\ub2e8\uacc4 \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc0d8\ud50c \uae30\ubc18\uc774\uba70, \ubd84\ud3ec Bellman \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc790\ub97c \uad6c\ud604\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ucd5c\ub300 \uc2ac\ub77c\uc774\uc2a4 \ucd5c\ub300 \ud3c9\uade0 \ubd88\uc77c\uce58(msMMD)\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 Sobolev \uc99d\uac00 Bellman \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc790\uac00 \uace0\uc720\ud55c \uace0\uc815\uc810\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \uc218\ucd95\uc784\uc744 \uc99d\uba85\ud558\uace0, \uae30\uc6b8\uae30 \uc778\uc2dd \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc218\ucd95\uc5d0 \uc218\ubc18\ub418\ub294 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ub9e4\ub044\ub7ec\uc6c0 \uc808\ucda9\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uba3c\uc800 \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \ud655\ub960\uc801 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc7a5\ub09c\uac10 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uace0, \ub2e4\uc74c\uc73c\ub85c \uc5ec\ub7ec MuJoCo \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud0b9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}}

Classical encryption algorithms suffer from a trade-off among security, image fidelity, and computational efficiency. This paper aims to enhance the performance and efficiency of image encryption. This is done by proposing Fractal encryption based on Fourier transforms as a new method of image encryption, leveraging state-of-the-art technology. The new approach considered here intends to enhance both security and efficiency in image encryption by comparing Fractal Encryption with basic methods. The suggested system also aims to optimise encryption/ decryption times and preserve image quality. This paper provides an introduction to Image Encryption using the fractal-based method, its mathematical formulation, and its comparative efficiency against publicly known traditional encryption methods. As a result, after filling the gaps identified in previous research, it has significantly improved both its encryption/decryption time and image fidelity compared to other techniques. In this paper, directions for future research and possible improvements are outlined for attention.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uc554\ud638\ud654\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud478\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ubcc0\ud658\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \ud504\ub799\ud0c8 \uc554\ud638\ud654 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubcf4\uc548\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc704\ud611\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uc2dc\ub300\uc5d0\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uc554\ud638\ud654 \uae30\uc220\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\ud504\ub799\ud0c8 \uc554\ud638\ud654 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uae30\ubcf8 \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf4\uc548\uc131\uacfc \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc774 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc774\uc804 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uacac\ub41c \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \uba54\uc6b0\uace0 \ub2e4\ub978 \uae30\uc220\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud588\uc744 \ub54c \uc554\ud638\ud654/\ubcf5\ud638\ud654 \uc2dc\uac04\uacfc \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ucda9\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ucf30\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc55e\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c \ubc29\ud5a5\uacfc \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uac1c\uc120 \uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud604\uc7ac \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubcf4\uc548 \uc704\ud611\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uc2dc\ub300\uc5d0\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uc554\ud638\ud654 \uae30\uc220\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \uace0\uc804\uc801\uc778 \uc554\ud638\ud654 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc740 \ubcf4\uc548, \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ucda9\uc2e4\ub3c4, \uacc4\uc0b0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \uac04\uc758 \uc808\ucda9\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uc554\ud638\ud654\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud478\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ubcc0\ud658\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \ud504\ub799\ud0c8 \uc554\ud638\ud654\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uae30\ubcf8 \ubc29\ubc95\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uc554\ud638\ud654\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf4\uc548\uc131\uacfc \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ubaa8\ub450 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ub610\ud55c \uc554\ud638\ud654/\ubcf5\ud638\ud654 \uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ud488\uc9c8\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud504\ub799\ud0c8 \uae30\ubc18 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \uc554\ud638\ud654\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc18c\uac1c, \uc218\ud559\uc801 \uacf5\uc2dd\ud654 \ubc0f \uacf5\uac1c\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc54c\ub824\uc9c4 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc554\ud638\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uacfc\uc758 \ube44\uad50 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4. \uadf8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc774\uc804 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dd\ubcc4\ub41c \uaca9\ucc28\ub97c \uba54\uc6b4 \ud6c4, \ub2e4\ub978 \uae30\uc220\ub4e4\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec \uc554\ud638\ud654/\ubcf5\ud638\ud654 \uc2dc\uac04\uacfc \uc774\ubbf8\uc9c0 \ucda9\uc2e4\uc131\uc774 \ud06c\uac8c \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc55e\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c \ubc29\ud5a5\uacfc \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uac1c\uc120 \uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4."}}

While reward models offer a scalable approach for reasoning trace verification, existing methods face two limitations: they produce only scalar reward values without explicit justification, and they rely on single-pass retrieval that precludes adaptive knowledge access as verification unfolds. We introduce $\\method$, an agentic framework that addresses these limitations by training medical reasoning verifiers to iteratively query external medical corpora during evaluation. Our approach combines tool-augmented verification with an iterative reinforcement learning paradigm that requires only trace-level supervision, alongside an adaptive curriculum mechanism that dynamically adjusts training data distribution. Across four medical reasoning benchmarks, $\\method$ achieves substantial gains over existing methods, improving MedQA accuracy by 23.5% and MedXpertQA by 32.0% relative to the base generator in particular. Crucially, $\\method$ demonstrates an $\\mathbf{8\\times}$ reduction in sampling budget requirement compared to prior reward model baselines. These findings establish that grounding verification in dynamically retrieved evidence offers a principled path toward more reliable medical reasoning systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc758\ub8cc \ucd94\ub860 \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 $\text{method}$\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ubc18\ubcf5 \uc9c8\uc758\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc678\ubd80 \uc758\ub8cc \ucf54\ud37c\uc2a4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc124\uacc4\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc758\ub8cc \ucd94\ub860\uc5d0\uc11c \uc88b\uc740 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ub0b4\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc784\uc0c1 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc801\uc6a9\uc744 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uc0ac\uc2e4 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ucca0\uc800\ud55c \uac80\uc99d\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc758\ub8cc \ucd94\ub860 \uac80\uc99d\uc790\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828\uc2dc\ucf1c \ud3c9\uac00 \uc911 \uc678\ubd80 \uc758\ub8cc \ucf54\ud37c\uc2a4\ub97c \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c8\uc758\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc778 $\text{method}$\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud588\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc758\ub8cc \ucd94\ub860 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc131\uacfc \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5c8\uace0, MedQA\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c 23.5%, MedXpertQA\ub97c 32.0% \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\uc0c9\ub41c \uc99d\uac70\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uac80\uc99d\uc774 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc758\ub8cc \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc73c\ub85c \uac00\ub294 \uc6d0\uce59\uc801\uc778 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc758\ub8cc \ucd94\ub860 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc73c\ub098, \uc784\uc0c1 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ubc30\uce58\ub294 \uc0ac\uc2e4 \uc815\ud655\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ucca0\uc800\ud55c \uac80\uc99d\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \ucd94\ub860 \ucd94\uc801 \uac80\uc99d\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud655\uc7a5 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud55c\uacc4\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uba74\ud574 \uc788\ub2e4: \uba85\ud655\ud55c \uc815\ub2f9\ud654 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc2a4\uce7c\ub77c \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uac12\ub9cc \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uba70, \uac80\uc99d\uc774 \uc9c4\ud589\ub420 \ub54c \uc801\uc751\ud615 \uc9c0\uc2dd \uc811\uadfc\uc744 \ubd88\uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4dc\ub294 \ub2e8\uc77c \uacbd\ub85c \uac80\uc0c9\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 $\text{method}$\ub77c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2f1 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \ud3c9\uac00 \uc911 \uc678\ubd80 \uc758\ub8cc \ucf54\ud37c\uc2a4\ub97c \ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c8\uc758\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uc758\ub8cc \ucd94\ub860 \uac80\uc99d\uc790\ub97c \ud6c8\ub828 \uc2dc\ud0a8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \ucd94\uc801 \uc218\uc900 \uac10\ub3c5\ub9cc\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \ubc18\ubcf5 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uacfc \ud568\uaed8 \ub3c4\uad6c \ubcf4\uac15 \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ud6c8\ub828 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubd84\ud3ec\ub97c \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc801\uc751\ud615 \ucee4\ub9ac\ud058\ub7fc \uba54\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc758\ub8cc \ucd94\ub860 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c $\text{method}$\ub294 \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc131\uacfc \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uae30\ubcf8 \uc0dd\uc131\uae30\uc5d0 \ube44\ub840\ud558\uc5ec MedQA\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\ub97c 23.5%, MedXpertQA\ub97c 32.0% \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uac83\uc740, $\text{method}$\uac00 \uc774\uc804 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \ubaa8\ub378 \uae30\uc900\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub9c1 \uc608\uc0b0 \uc694\uad6c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 $\textbf{8\times}$ \uc904\uc778\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc1c\uacac\uc740 \ub3d9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\uc0c9\ub41c \uc99d\uac70\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uac80\uc99d\uc774 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc758\ub8cc \ucd94\ub860 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc73c\ub85c \uac00\ub294 \uc6d0\uce59\uc801\uc778 \uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4."}}

The proposed method introduces a meta-trust variable driven by Value Prediction Error Stability (VPES), which modulates learning dynamics via fail-safe regulation and gradual trust recovery.\n  Experiments on continuous-control benchmarks with reward corruption demonstrate that recovery-enabled meta-cognitive control achieves higher average returns and significantly reduces late-stage training failures compared to strong robustness baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uba54\ud0c0 \uc778\uc9c0 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud589\ub3d9\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc870\uc815\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc774\ub098 \ubd80\uc801\uc808\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \uc5b5\uc81c\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub450\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5 \uacfc\uc815\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc81c\uc548\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uac00\uce58 \uc608\uce21 \uc624\ub958 \uc548\uc815\uc131(VPES)\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uad6c\ub3d9\ub418\ub294 \uba54\ud0c0 \uc2e0\ub8b0 \ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \ud559\uc2b5 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uc548\uc804\ud558\uac8c \uc870\uc808\ud558\uace0 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub97c \uc810\uc9c4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud68c\ubcf5\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc190\uc0c1\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uacc4\uc18d\uc801 \uc81c\uc5b4 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud68c\ubcf5 \uae30\ub2a5\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uba54\ud0c0 \uc778\uc9c0 \uc81c\uc5b4\uac00 \ub192\uc740 \ud3c9\uade0 \uc218\uc775\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uac15\uac74\uc131 \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ud6c4\uae30 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc2e4\ud328\ub97c \ud06c\uac8c \uc904\uc784\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uba54\ud0c0 \uc778\uc9c0 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5\uc774 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc785\uc99d\ud588\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uac15\uac74\ud55c \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc774\ub098 \uc624\uc5fc\ub41c \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \uc5b5\uc81c\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd94\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5 \uacfc\uc815\uc758 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \uc774\uc720\ub85c \uc0bc\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4. \uadf8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ud754\ud788 \ub178\uc774\uc988\uc5d0 \uacfc\ub3c4\ud558\uac8c \ubc18\uc751\ud558\uc5ec \uc9c0\ub098\uce58\uac8c \ubcf4\uc218\uc801\uc774 \ub418\uac70\ub098 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc774 \ucd95\uc801\ub420 \ub54c \uce58\uba85\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2e4\ud328\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uac00 \ub0b4\ubd80\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\uc815\ub41c \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uc2e0\ud638\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud558\uc5ec \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc870\uc808\ud558\uba70 \ud68c\ubcf5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\ub294 \uba54\ud0c0 \uc778\uc9c0 \uac15\ud654 \ud559\uc2b5 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc548\ub41c \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \uac00\uce58 \uc608\uce21 \uc624\ub958 \uc548\uc815\uc131(VPES)\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uad6c\ub3d9\ub418\ub294 \uba54\ud0c0 \uc2e0\ub8b0 \ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc548\uc804\ud558\uac8c \uc870\uc808\ud558\uba70 \uc810\uc9c4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub97c \ud68c\ubcf5\ud558\ub294 \ud559\uc2b5 \ub3d9\uc5ed\ud559\uc744 \uc870\uc808\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubcf4\uc0c1 \uc624\uc5fc\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uc5f0\uc18d \uc81c\uc5b4 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud06c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc740 \ud68c\ubcf5 \uac00\ub2a5 \uba54\ud0c0 \uc778\uc9c0 \uc81c\uc5b4\uac00 \ub192\uc740 \ud3c9\uade0 \uc218\uc775\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uac15\uac74\uc131 \uae30\uc900\uc120\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ud6c4\uae30 \ud6c8\ub828 \uc2e4\ud328\ub97c \ud06c\uac8c \uc904\uc778\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4."}}

However, these models fall short in real-world scenarios, lacking multi-turn conversational ability, on-device efficiency, and precise understanding of ECG measurements such as the PQRST intervals. To address these limitations, we introduce ECG-Agent, the first LLM-based tool-calling agent for multi-turn ECG dialogue. To facilitate its development and evaluation, we also present ECG-Multi-Turn-Dialogue (ECG-MTD) dataset, a collection of realistic user-assistant multi-turn dialogues for diverse ECG lead configurations. We develop ECG-Agents in various sizes, from on-device capable to larger agents. Experimental results show that ECG-Agents outperform baseline ECG-LLMs in response accuracy.

Existing methods typically scale up rollout sizes and indiscriminately allocate computational resources among intermediate steps. Such attempts inherently waste substantial computation budget on trivial steps while failing to guarantee sample quality. To address this, we propose \\textbf{Spark} (\\textbf{S}trategic \\textbf{P}olicy-\\textbf{A}ware explo\\textbf{R}ation via \\textbf{K}ey-state dynamic branching), a novel framework that selectively branches at critical decision states for resource-efficient exploration. Our key insight is to activate adaptive branching exploration at critical decision points to probe promising trajectories, thereby achieving precise resource allocation that prioritizes sampling quality over blind coverage. This design leverages the agent's intrinsic decision-making signals to reduce dependence on human priors, enabling the agent to autonomously expand exploration and achieve stronger generalization. Experiments across diverse tasks (e.g., embodied planning), demonstrate that \\textsc{Spark} achieves superior success rates with significantly fewer training samples, exhibiting robust generalization

Benefiting from the strong capabilities of LLMs, recent research focus has shifted from simple context extension to the development of dedicated agentic memory systems. However, existing approaches typically rely on rigid retrieval granularity, accumulation-heavy maintenance strategies, and coarse-grained update mechanisms. These design choices create a persistent mismatch between stored information and task-specific reasoning demands, while leading to the unchecked accumulation of logical inconsistencies over time. To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive Memory via Multi-Agent Collaboration (AMA), a novel framework that leverages coordinated agents to manage memory across multiple granularities. AMA employs a hierarchical memory design that dynamically aligns retrieval granularity with task complexity. Specifically, the Constructor and Retriever jointly enable multi-granularity memory construction and adaptive query routing. The Judge verifies the relevance and consistency of retrieved content, triggering iterative retrieval when evidence is insufficient or invoking the Refresher upon detecting logical conflicts. The Refresher then enforces memory consistency by performing targeted updates or removing outdated entries. Extensive experiments on challenging long-context benchmarks show that AMA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while reducing token consumption by approximately 80% compared to full-context methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in maintaining retrieval precision and long-term memory consistency.", "AI": {"tldr": "AMA\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ud06c\uae30\uc5d0\uc11c \uae30\uc5b5\uc744 \uad00\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub85c, \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc77c\uad00\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \ub17c\ub9ac\uc801 \ubaa8\uc21c\uc744 \uc904\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "motivation": "LLM \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc7a5\uae30 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uacfc \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \ub300\ub450\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "method": "Adaptive Memory via Multi-Agent Collaboration (AMA)\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ud611\uc870\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc5ec\ub7ec \ud06c\uae30\uc5d0\uc11c \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\ub97c \uad00\ub9ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Oraevsky", "Umberto Villa", "Mark A. Anastasio"], "title": "A Learning-based Framework for Spatial Impulse Response Compensation in 3D Photoacoustic Computed Tomography", "comment": "Submitted to IEEE TMI", "summary": "Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) is a promising imaging modality that combines the advantages of optical contrast with ultrasound detection. Utilizing ultrasound transducers with larger surface areas can improve detection sensitivity. However, when computationally efficient analytic reconstruction methods that neglect the spatial impulse responses (SIRs) of the transducer are employed, the spatial resolution of the reconstructed images will be compromised. Although optimization-based reconstruction methods can explicitly account for SIR effects, their computational cost is generally high, particularly in three-dimensional (3D) applications. To address the need for accurate but rapid 3D PACT image reconstruction, this study presents a framework for establishing a learned SIR compensation method that operates in the data domain. The learned compensation method maps SIR-corrupted PACT measurement data to compensated data that would have been recorded by idealized point-like transducers. Subsequently, the compensated data can be used with a computationally efficient reconstruction method that neglects SIR effects. Two variants of the learned compensation model are investigated that employ a U-Net model and a specifically designed, physics-inspired model, referred to as Deconv-Net. A fast and analytical training data generation procedure is also a component of the presented framework. The framework is rigorously validated in virtual imaging studies, demonstrating resolution improvement and robustness to noise variations, object complexity, and sound speed heterogeneity. When applied to in-vivo breast imaging data, the learned compensation models revealed fine structures that had been obscured by SIR-induced artifacts.

In this report, we present OmegaUse, a general-purpose GUI agent model for autonomous task execution on both mobile and desktop platforms, supporting computer-use and phone-use scenarios. Building an effective GUI agent model relies on two factors: (1) high-quality data and (2) effective training methods. To address these, we introduce a carefully engineered data-construction pipeline and a decoupled training paradigm. For data construction, we leverage rigorously curated open-source datasets and introduce a novel automated synthesis framework that integrates bottom-up autonomous exploration with top-down taxonomy-guided generation to create high-fidelity synthetic data. For training, to better leverage these data, we adopt a two-stage strategy: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to establish fundamental interaction syntax, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve spatial grounding and sequential planning. To balance computational efficiency with agentic reasoning capacity, OmegaUse is built on a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) backbone. To evaluate cross-terminal capabilities in an offline setting, we introduce OS-Nav, a benchmark suite spanning multiple operating systems: ChiM-Nav, targeting Chinese Android mobile environments, and Ubu-Nav, focusing on routine desktop interactions on Ubuntu. Extensive experiments show that OmegaUse is highly competitive across established GUI benchmarks, achieving a state-of-the-art (SOTA) score of 96.3% on ScreenSpot-V2 and a leading 79.1% step success rate on AndroidControl.

However, SD remains largely unexplored for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), which extend LLMs to process both image and text prompts. To address this gap, we benchmark existing inference methods with small draft models on 11 datasets across diverse input scenarios and observe scenario-specific performance fluctuations. Motivated by these findings, we propose Test-time Adaptive Batched Ensemble Drafting (TABED), which dynamically ensembles multiple drafts obtained via batch inference by leveraging deviations from past ground truths available in the SD setting. The dynamic ensemble method achieves an average robust walltime speedup of 1.74x over autoregressive decoding and a 5% improvement over single drafting methods, while remaining training-free and keeping ensembling costs negligible through parameter sharing. With its plug-and-play compatibility, we further enhance TABED by integrating advanced verification and alternative drafting methods.

While previous studies on human-AI cooperation have primarily focused on dyadic interactions, little is known about how integrating AI agents affects the emergence and maintenance of cooperative norms in small groups. This study addresses this gap through an online experiment using a repeated four-player Public Goods Game (PGG). Each group consisted of three human participants and one bot, which was framed either as human or AI and followed one of three predefined decision strategies: unconditional cooperation, conditional cooperation, or free-riding. In our sample of 236 participants, we found that reciprocal group dynamics and behavioural inertia primarily drove cooperation. These normative mechanisms operated identically across conditions, resulting in cooperation levels that did not differ significantly between human and AI labels. Furthermore, we found no evidence of differences in norm persistence in a follow-up Prisoner's Dilemma, or in participants' normative perceptions. Participants' behaviour followed the same normative logic across human and AI conditions, indicating that cooperation depended on group behaviour rather than partner identity. This supports a pattern of normative equivalence, in which the mechanisms that sustain cooperation function similarly in mixed human-AI and all human groups. These findings suggest that cooperative norms are flexible enough to extend to artificial agents, blurring the boundary between humans and AI in collective decision-making.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774

Traditional rule-based metrics like Time-to-Collision are too simplistic to capture complex interaction risks, and existing methods lack a systematic way to verify whether statistical anomalies truly reflect physical danger. To address this gap, we propose an unsupervised anomaly detection framework based on a multi-agent Transformer that models normal driving and measures deviations through prediction residuals. A dual evaluation scheme has been proposed to assess both detection stability and physical alignment: Stability is measured using standard ranking metrics in which Kendall Rank Correlation Coefficient captures rank agreement and Jaccard index captures the consistency of the top-K selected items; Physical alignment is assessed through correlations with established Surrogate Safety Measures (SSM). Experiments on the NGSIM dataset demonstrate our framework's effectiveness: We show that the maximum residual aggregator achieves the highest physical alignment while maintaining stability. Furthermore, our framework identifies 388 unique anomalies missed by Time-to-Collision and statistical baselines, capturing subtle multi-agent risks like reactive braking under lateral drift. The detected anomalies are further clustered into four interpretable risk types, offering actionable insights for simulation and testing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc790\uc728\uc8fc\ud589\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc548\uc804-critical \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624 \uc2dd\ubcc4\uc740 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\ub098, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc0ac\uac74\uc758 \ud76c\uadc0\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uac10\ub3c5\ub41c \ub77c\ubca8\ub9c1\uc740 \ube44\ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uaddc\uce59 \uae30\ubc18 \uba54\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc740 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\uae30\uc5d0\ub294 \uc9c0\ub098\uce58\uac8c \ub2e8\uc21c\ud558\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc815\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \uc8fc\ud589\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uace0 \uc608\uce21 \uc794\ucc28\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\ud0c8\uc744 \uce21\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30 \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ube44\uac10\ub3c5 \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uc548\uc804-critical \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624 \uc2dd\ubcc4\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uacfc \uae30\uc874 \ubc29\ubc95\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uace0\ub824\ud560 \ub54c, \uc790\uc728\uc8fc\ud589 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "method": "\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ubcc0\ud658\uae30 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uc5ec \uc815\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \uc8fc\ud589\uc744 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ud558\uace0 \uc608\uce21 \uc794\ucc28\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\uc0c1\uc744 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ube44\uac10\ub3c5 \uc774\uc0c1 \ud0d0\uc9c0 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\uc911 \ud3c9\uac00 \uccb4\uacc4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud0d0\uc9c0\uc758 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uacfc \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\uc2e4\ud5d8\uc740 NGSIM \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc14b\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 \ucd5c\ub300 \uc794\ucc28 \uc9d1\uacc4\uae30\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uac00\uc7a5 \ub192\uc740 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uc801 \uc815\ub82c\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, 388\uac1c\uc758 \uace0\uc720\ud55c \uc774\uc0c1\uc744 \uc2dd\ubcc4\ud558\uc600\uace0, \uc774\ub294 Time-to-Collision \ubc0f \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801 \uae30\uc900\uc73c\ub85c \ub193\ucce4\ub358 \uc138\ubc00\ud55c \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\ud0d0\uc9c0\ub41c \uc774\uc0c1\uc740 \ub124 \uac00\uc9c0 \ud574\uc11d \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc704\ud5d8 \uc720\ud615\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\uac00 \uadf8\ub8f9\ud654\ub418\uc5b4 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ubc0f \ud14c\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\ud589 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud1b5\ucc30\ub825\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uc548\uc804-critical \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624 \uc2dd\ubcc4\uc740 \uc790\uc728\uc8fc\ud589\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc0ac\uac74\uc758 \ud76c\uadc0\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uac10\ub3c5\ub41c \ub77c\ubca8\ub9c1\uc740 \ube44\ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc774\ub2e4.

We propose a novel multi-agent reasoning framework, referred to as Planning through World Model for Automated Heuristic Design via Self-Evolving LLMs (PathWise), which formulates heuristic generation as a sequential decision process over an entailment graph serving as a compact, stateful memory of the search trajectory. This approach allows the system to carry forward past decisions and reuse or avoid derivation information across generations. A policy agent plans evolutionary actions, a world model agent generates heuristic rollouts conditioned on those actions, and critic agents provide routed reflections summarizing lessons from prior steps, shifting LLM-based AHD from trial-and-error evolution toward state-aware planning through reasoning. Experiments across diverse COPs show that PathWise converges faster to better heuristics, generalizes across different LLM backbones, and scales to larger problem sizes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uae30\uc874 \uc790\ub3d9 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1 \uc124\uacc4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ucd94\ub860 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 \uc790\ub3d9 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1 \uc124\uacc4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \uace0\uc815\ub41c \uc9c4\ud654 \uaddc\uce59 \ubc0f \uc815\uc801 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ud15c\ud50c\ub9bf\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\uc810\uc744 \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "PathWise\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \ucd94\ub860 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc21c\ucc28\uc801 \uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ub9bd\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uacfc\uac70 \uacb0\uc815\uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \uc774\uc5b4\ubc1b\uace0 \uc815\ubcf4 \ud65c\uc6a9 \ubc0f \ud68c\ud53c\uac00 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\ub2e4.", "result": "\ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc870\ud569 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc, PathWise\ub294 \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1\uc73c\ub85c \ub354 \ube60\ub974\uac8c \uc218\ub834\ud558\uace0, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c LLM \ubc31\ubcf8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub418\uba70, \ub354 \ud070 \ubb38\uc81c \ud06c\uae30\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ub41c\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 LLM \uae30\ubc18 \uc790\ub3d9 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1 \uc124\uacc4\uac00 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \uc2dc\ud589\ucc29\uc624\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc97\uc5b4\ub098 \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc778\uc2dd \uacc4\ud68d\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\ud658\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(LLM)\uc740 \uc870\ud569 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubb38\uc81c(COP)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc790\ub3d9 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1 \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uc600\uc73c\ub098, \uae30\uc874 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uace0\uc815\ub41c \uc9c4\ud654 \uaddc\uce59\uacfc \uc815\uc801 \ud504\ub86c\ud504\ud2b8 \ud15c\ud50c\ub9bf\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uc5ec \ub2e8\uae30\uc801\uc778 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1 \uc0dd\uc131, \uc911\ubcf5 \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc0f \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1 \uc720\ub3c4 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc790\uac00 \uc9c4\ud654 LLM\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \uc790\ub3d9 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1 \uc124\uacc4\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uacc4\ud68d(PathWise)\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub2e4\uc911 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \ucd94\ub860 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uba70, \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \uac80\uc0c9 \uacbd\ub85c\uc758 \ucef4\ud329\ud2b8\ud55c \uc0c1\ud0dc \uae30\uc5b5\uc18c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud558\ub294 \ud568\uc758 \uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc21c\ucc28\uc801 \uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ub9bd\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc811\uadfc \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \uacfc\uac70\uc758 \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc9c0\uc18d\ud558\uace0 \uc138\ub300\ub97c \ub118\uc5b4 \uc720\ub3c4 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc7ac\uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ud68c\ud53c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc815\ucc45 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc9c4\ud654 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \uacc4\ud68d\ud558\uace0, \uc138\uacc4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \uc870\uac74\ud654\ub41c \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1 \ub864\uc544\uc6c3\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud558\uba70, \ube44\ud3c9 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\ub294 \uc774\uc804 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5bb\uc740 \uad50\ud6c8\uc744 \uc694\uc57d\ud55c \ub77c\uc6b0\ud305\ub41c \ubc18\uc601\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 LLM \uae30\ubc18 AHD\ub97c \uc2dc\ud589\ucc29\uc624 \uc9c4\ud654\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd94\ub860\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \uc0c1\ud0dc \uc778\uc2dd \uacc4\ud68d\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\ud658\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c COP\uc744 \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 PathWise\uac00 \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \ud734\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f1\uc73c\ub85c \ub354 \ube60\ub974\uac8c \uc218\ub834\ud558\uba70, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c LLM \ubc31\ubcf8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub418\uace0, \ub354 \ud070 \ubb38\uc81c \ud06c\uae30\uc5d0 \ud655\uc7a5\ub428\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4."}}

However, such data often contains numerous low-quality samples, necessitating effective data processing (DP). In practice, DP strategies are typically developed through iterative manual analysis and trial-and-error adjustment. These processes inevitably incur high labor costs and may lead to privacy issues in high-privacy domains like healthcare due to direct human access to sensitive data. Thus, achieving automated data processing without exposing the raw data has become a critical challenge. To address this challenge, we propose LLM-AutoDP, a novel framework that leverages LLMs as agents to automatically generate and optimize data processing strategies. Our method generates multiple candidate strategies and iteratively refines them using feedback signals and comparative evaluations. This iterative in-context learning mechanism enables the agent to converge toward high-quality processing pipelines without requiring direct human intervention or access to the underlying data. To further accelerate strategy search, we introduce three key techniques: Distribution Preserving Sampling, which reduces data volume while maintaining distributional integrity; Processing Target Selection, which uses a binary classifier to identify low-quality samples for focused processing; Cache-and-Reuse Mechanism}, which minimizes redundant computations by reusing prior processing results. Results show that models trained on data processed by our framework achieve over 80% win rates against models trained on unprocessed data.

Our focus is on two core properties such task-oriented protocols may exhibit: Efficiency -- conveying task-relevant information more concisely than natural language, and Covertness -- becoming difficult for external observers to interpret, raising concerns about transparency and control. To investigate these aspects, we use a referential-game framework in which vision-language model (VLM) agents communicate, providing a controlled, measurable setting for evaluating language variants. Experiments show that VLMs can develop effective, task-adapted communication patterns.

Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) can encode scans into lower-dimensional latent spaces capturing disease-relevant features. We propose a semi-supervised VAE framework with a flexible similarity regularization term that aligns selected latent variables with clinical or biomarker measures of dementia progression. This allows adapting the similarity metric and supervised variables to specific goals or available data. We demonstrate the approach using PET scans from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), guiding the first latent dimension to align with a cognitive score. Using this supervised latent variable, we generate average reconstructions across levels of cognitive impairment. Voxel-wise GLM analysis reveals reduced metabolism in key regions, mainly the hippocampus, and within major Resting State Networks, particularly the Default Mode and Central Executive Networks. The remaining latent variables encode affine transformations and intensity variations, capturing confounds such as inter-subject variability and site effects. Our framework effectively extracts disease-related patterns aligned with established Alzheimer's biomarkers, offering an interpretable and adaptable tool for studying neurodegenerative progression.",

The limited size of this context window necessitates memory compression and retrieval systems like RAG. These systems however often treat memory as large offline storage spaces, which is unfavorable for embodied agents that are expected to operate under strict memory and compute constraints, online. In this work, we propose MemCtrl, a novel framework that uses Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for pruning memory online. MemCtrl augments MLLMs with a trainable memory head \u03bcthat acts as a gate to determine which observations or reflections to retain, update, or discard during exploration. We evaluate with training two types of \u03bc, 1) via an offline expert, and 2) via online RL, and observe significant improvement in overall embodied task completion ability on \u03bc-augmented MLLMs. In particular, on augmenting two low performing MLLMs with MemCtrl on multiple subsets of the EmbodiedBench benchmark, we observe that \u03bc-augmented MLLMs show an improvement of around 16% on average, with over 20% on specific instruction subsets. Finally, we present a qualitative analysis on the memory fragments collected by \u03bc, noting the superior performance of \u03bcaugmented MLLMs on long and complex instruction types.", "AI": {"tldr": "MemCtrl\ub294 \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc628\ub77c\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\ub97c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub8e8\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc774\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\uae30\uc874 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \uae30\uc5b5 \uc6a9\ub7c9\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc2e0\uccb4\ud654\ub41c \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc758 \uc694\uad6c\ub97c \ucda9\uc871\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.", "method": "MemCtrl\ub294 \ud6c8\ub828 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ud5e4\ub4dc \u03bc\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud0d0\uc0c9 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5b4\ub5a4 \uad00\ucc30\uc774\ub098 \ubc18\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0, \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8 \ub610\ub294 \ud3d0\uae30\ud560\uc9c0\ub97c \uacb0\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "\u03bc\ub85c \ubcf4\uac15\ub41c MLLM\uc740 \uc784\ubca0\ub514\ub4dc \uc791\uc5c5 \uc644\ub8cc \ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \ud3c9\uade0 16% \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\uc5c8\uace0, \ud2b9\uc815 \uc9c0\uce68 \ud558\uc704 \uc9d1\ud569\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 20% \uc774\uc0c1 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "\u03bc\ub85c \ubcf4\uac15\ub41c MLLM\uc740 \uae34 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uc9c0\uce68 \uc720\ud615\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\uae30\ucd08 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uac1c\uc778\ud654\ub41c \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ub9e5\ub77d \ub0b4 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774 \ub9e5\ub77d \ucc3d\uc758 \uc81c\ud55c\ub41c \ud06c\uae30\ub294 RAG\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc555\ucd95 \ubc0f \uac80\uc0c9 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ud544\uc694\ub85c \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc885\uc885 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\ub97c \ud070 \uc624\ud504\ub77c\uc778 \uc800\uc7a5 \uacf5\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \ucde8\uae09\ud558\ub294\ub370, \uc774\ub294 \uc5c4\uaca9\ud55c \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \ubc0f \uacc4\uc0b0 \uc81c\uc57d \uc544\ub798\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\ub3d9\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294 \uad6c\ud604 \uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8\uc5d0\ub294 \ubc14\ub78c\uc9c1\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 MemCtrl\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc628\ub77c\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\ub97c \uac00\uc9c0\uce58\uae30\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uba40\ud2f0\ubaa8\ub2ec \ub300\ud615 \uc5b8\uc5b4 \ubaa8\ub378(MLLM)\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud504\ub808\uc784\uc6cc\ud06c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.

Machine-learning (ML) controllers are increasingly deployed in (autonomous) cyber-physical systems because of their ability to solve complex decision-making tasks. However, their accuracy can degrade sharply in unfamiliar environments, creating significant safety concerns. Traditional ensemble methods aim to improve robustness by averaging or voting across multiple controllers, yet this often dilutes the specialized strengths that individual controllers exhibit in different operating contexts. We argue that, rather than blending controller outputs, a monitoring framework should identify and exploit these contextual strengths. In this paper, we reformulate the design of safe AI-based control ensembles as a contextual monitoring problem. A monitor continuously observes the system's context and selects the controller best suited to the current conditions. To achieve this, we cast monitor learning as a contextual learning task and draw on techniques from contextual multi-armed bandits. Our approach comes with two key benefits: (1) theoretical safety guarantees during controller selection, and (2) improved utilization of controller diversity. We validate our framework in two simulated autonomous driving scenarios, demonstrating significant improvements in both safety and performance compared to non-contextual baselines.", "AI": {"tldr":

Our system utilizes two key innovations: Sequential Research Plan Refinement via Reflection and a Candidates Crossover algorithm. The sequential refinement process is demonstrated as an efficient method that allows the agent to maintain a centralized Global Research Context, enabling it to look back at current progress, reason about the research plan, and intelligently make changes at runtime. This dynamic adaptation contrasts with parallel approaches, which often suffer from siloed knowledge. The Candidates Crossover algorithm further enhances search efficiency by deploying multiple LLM candidates with varied parameters to explore a larger search space, with their findings synthesized to curate a comprehensive final research response. The process concludes with One Shot Report Generation, ensuring the final document is informed by a unified narrative and high fact density. Powered by the Gemini 2.5 Pro model, our Deep Researcher was evaluated on the DeepResearch Bench, a globally recognized benchmark of 100 doctoral level research tasks. Our architecture achieved an overall score of 46.21, demonstrating superior performance by surpassing leading deep research agents such as Claude Researcher, Nvidia AIQ Research Assistant, Perplexity Research, Kimi Researcher and Grok Deeper Search present on the DeepResearch Bench actively running leaderboard.

This paper introduces MORPHIN, a self-adaptive Q-learning framework that enables on-the-fly adaptation without full retraining. By integrating concept drift detection with dynamic adjustments to learning and exploration hyperparameters, MORPHIN adapts agents to changes in both the reward function and on-the-fly expansions of the agent's action space, while preserving prior policy knowledge to prevent catastrophic forgetting. We validate our approach using a Gridworld benchmark and a traffic signal control simulation.

In this work, we introduce Continual GUI Agents, a new task that requires GUI agents to perform continual learning under shifted domains and resolutions. We find existing methods fail to maintain stable grounding as GUI distributions shift over time, due to the diversity of UI interaction points and regions in fluxing scenarios. To address this, we introduce GUI-Anchoring in Flux (GUI-AiF), a new reinforcement fine-tuning framework that stabilizes continual learning through two novel rewards: Anchoring Point Reward in Flux (APR-iF) and Anchoring Region Reward in Flux (ARR-iF).

Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) addresses this challenge by enabling learning systems to continuously learn new classes while preserving prior knowledge. With the rise of pre-trained models (PTMs) such as CLIP, leveraging their strong generalization and semantic alignment capabilities has become a promising direction in CIL. However, existing CLIP-based CIL methods are often scattered across disparate codebases, rely on inconsistent configurations, hindering fair comparisons, reproducibility, and practical adoption. Therefore, we propose C3Box (CLIP-based Class-inCremental learning toolBOX), a modular and comprehensive Python toolbox. C3Box integrates representative traditional CIL methods, ViT-based CIL methods, and state-of-the-art CLIP-based CIL methods into a unified CLIP-based framework. By inheriting the streamlined design of PyCIL, C3Box provides a JSON-based configuration and standardized execution pipeline. This design enables reproducible experimentation with low engineering overhead and makes C3Box a reliable benchmark platform for continual learning research.

Implementing such continually learning systems have several challenges, one of which is the large memory requirement of gradient-based algorithms that are used to train state-of-the-art LLMs. Evolutionary Strategies (ES) have recently re-emerged as a gradient-free alternative to traditional learning algorithms and have shown encouraging performance on specific tasks in LLMs. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive analysis of ES and specifically evaluate its forgetting curves when training for an increasing number of update steps. We first find that ES is able to reach performance numbers close to GRPO for math and reasoning tasks with a comparable compute budget. However, and most importantly for continual learning, the performance gains in ES is accompanied by significant forgetting of prior abilities, limiting its applicability for training models online. We also explore the reason behind this behavior and show that the updates made using ES are much less sparse and have orders of magnitude larger $\\ell_2$ norm compared to corresponding GRPO updates, explaining the contrasting forgetting curves between the two algorithms. With this study, we aim to highlight the issue of forgetting in gradient-free algorithms like ES and hope to inspire future work to mitigate these issues.", "AI": {"tldr": "\uae30\uc874 AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5 \ub2a5\ub825 \ubd80\uc871 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uba70, \uc9c4\ud654 \uc804\ub7b5(ES) \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\uacfc \uae30\uc5b5 \uc0c1\uc2e4 \uace1\uc120\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c\ub2e4.", "motivation": "\ud604\uc7ac AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5 \ub2a5\ub825 \ubd80\uc871 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "method": "\uc9c4\ud654 \uc804\ub7b5(ES)\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8 \ub2e8\uacc4 \uc218\uac00 \uc99d\uac00\ud560 \ub54c\uc758 \uae30\uc5b5 \uc0c1\uc2e4 \uace1\uc120\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4.", "result": "ES\ub294 \uc218\ud559 \ubc0f \ucd94\ub860 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c GRPO\uc5d0 \uadfc\uc811\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\uc804 \ub2a5\ub825\uc758 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uae30\uc5b5 \uc0c1\uc2e4\uc774 \ub3d9\ubc18\ub418\uc5b4 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0 \ud55c\uacc4\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4.", "conclusion": "ES\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uacbd\ub7c9 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \uae30\uc5b5 \uc0c1\uc2e4 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uac15\uc870\ud558\uace0, \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc644\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubbf8\ub798 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0 \uc601\uac10\uc744 \uc8fc\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "translated_summary": "\ud604\uc7ac AI \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uac00\uc7a5 \ud070 \uacb0\ud54d \uae30\ub2a5 \uc911 \ud558\ub098\ub294 \ubc30\ud3ec \ud6c4\uc5d0\ub3c4 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2a5\ub825\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uad6c\ud604\ud558\ub294 \ub370\ub294 \uba87 \uac00\uc9c0 \ub3c4\uc804 \uacfc\uc81c\uac00 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uadf8 \uc911 \ud558\ub098\ub294 \ucd5c\uc2e0 LLM\uc744 \ud6c8\ub828\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \uacbd\ub7c9\ud654\ub41c \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \ud070 \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac \uc694\uad6c\ub7c9\uc774\ub2e4. \uc9c4\ud654 \uc804\ub7b5(ES)\uc740 \ucd5c\uadfc \uc804\ud1b5 \ud559\uc2b5 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ube44\uacbd\ub7c9\ud654 \ub300\uc548\uc73c\ub85c \uc7ac\ubd80\uc0c1\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \ud2b9\uc815 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c LLM\uc5d0\uc11c \uace0\ubb34\uc801\uc778 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 ES\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uace0, \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub97c \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0ac \ub54c\uc758 \uae30\uc5b5 \uc0c1\uc2e4 \uace1\uc120\uc744 \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4. \uba3c\uc800 ES\uac00 \uc218\ud559 \ubc0f \ucd94\ub860 \uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c GRPO\uc5d0 \uadfc\uc811\ud55c \uc131\ub2a5 \uc218\uce58\ub97c \ub3c4\ub2ec\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ud559\uc2b5\uc5d0 \uac00\uc7a5 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc810\uc740 ES\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc774 \uc774\uc804 \ub2a5\ub825\uc758 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uae30\uc5b5 \uc0c1\uc2e4\uc744 \ub3d9\ubc18\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ubaa8\ub378 \ud6c8\ub828\uc5d0 \uc81c\ud55c\uc744 \ub450\ub294 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub610\ud55c \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud589\ub3d9\uc758 \uc6d0\uc778\uc744 \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uace0 ES\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc218\ud589\ub41c \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\uac00 \ud6e8\uc52c \ub35c \ud76c\uc18c\ud558\uace0 \ud574\ub2f9 GRPO \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uba87 \ubc30 \ub354 \ud070 $\text{l}_2$ \ub178\ub984\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5b4 \ub450 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998 \uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\ubc18\ub41c \uae30\uc5b5 \uc0c1\uc2e4 \uace1\uc120\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 ES\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \ube44\uacbd\ub7c9 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uae30\uc5b5 \uc0c1\uc2e4 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uac15\uc870\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc644\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud5a5\ud6c4 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0 \uc601\uac10\uc744 \uc8fc\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4."}}
